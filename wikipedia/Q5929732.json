He appears from 2004 to 2006 as Rosie Miller's (Gerry Cowper) brother.", "In May 2005, the Millers return to their former home in a block of flats whilst a rat problem in the square is being dealt with. Demi is reluctant, as it means she is likely to see Leo. Upon their arrival, Leo's father Ray (Dorian Lough) and his wife Trisha (Cathy Murphy) are the first people they see, and they receive a cold reception. Whilst taking Aleesha for a walk, Demi is teased by some of her brother Darren's (Charlie G. Hawkins) old friends, who mock her and refer to her as \"Vicky Pollard\". Upon heading back to the flats, Demi sees Leo and tries to escape in a lift, but Leo stops her. They realise their split had been due to their parents meddling and denying contact between the two, and they reunite. Demi tells Leo that it is Aleesha's christening the following day. Despite appearing reluctant, Leo and Trisha attend the christening, however the service is interrupted by Ray, who viciously drags his wife and son away whilst a heartbroken Demi looks on. The christening continues back at Clint's (Huggy Leaver) flat, and Demi and Leo meet later that evening from their balconies. As the feud between the Millers and the Taylors escalates, Leo plans to run away, and begs Demi to come with him. Demi agrees, but Leo abandons her when she insists on taking Aleesha. Demi returns to Walford, devastated, but is delighted when she meets Leo near the swings. Leo promises her he will keep in contact, and will wait as long as it takes to be with her."]}, {"page": "Huggy", "response": ["*Huggy Leaver"]}, {"page": "Leaver", "response": ["** Huggy Leaver (real name Hugh Leaver), British actor"]}, {"page": "White Light Motorcade (band)", "response": ["In December 2003, the band created a video for \"My Way\", featuring Sophie Lovell Anderson and Huggy Leaver.
