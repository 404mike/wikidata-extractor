He was seconded to the Department of Health where he was Director of the Strategy Unit working with Alan Milburn and John Reid until 2004.He was said to be \"unrivalled in his ability to distil and synthesise complex policy developments and present them in a clear and digestible manner for non-specialists\" in 1999.

This may lead to improved care in some cases but the King's Fund claims not all community care plans are credible because there are insufficient services outside hospitals and there is insufficient money to provide more.

Ham maintains further transfer to the community cannot be done without extra funding and urges the government to invest in community services.
