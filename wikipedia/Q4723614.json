His The Squared-Circle Cancellations of Canada  received its third edition shortly after his death.Whitehead's music is tonal and sometimes modal; his output of motets and anthems was extensive and he took particular pride in the anthems Alleluia, Sing to Jesus (with organ accompaniment),Ye Choirs of New Jerusalem, Now God Be with Us, and O Light Beyond Our Utmost Light, the short motets Bread of the World, Grant Us Grace, and Almighty God, Whose Glory. Leo Sowerby, a leading American cathedral organist-composer, described Whitehead's Benedicite, based on the Gregorian Tonus peregrinus, as the \"best Benedicite\" he knew. Whitehead's eight-part motets Watch Thou, Dear Lord (words by St Augustine) and Love Unknown, the Brahmsian organ Prelude on Irby, and his many short carols for Christmas, are also noteworthy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christ Church Cathedral (Montreal)", "response": ["Recent additions to the church include a choir gallery, built in 1980, and the church's third organ, installed in 1981.

This is not too surprising, since a number of famous logicians have also happened to be (perhaps more precisely speaking, called) philosophers in effect. The two founding fathers of Anglo-American analytic philosophy, Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead, argued for logicism that subordinates math to logic. These top philosophers also happened to be mathematicians (who co-authored Principia Mathematica), hence logicans (who essentially aims to improve the system of logic).
