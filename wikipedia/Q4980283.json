The National Portrait Gallery would have collected a series of canvases milestoning her advancing years...Bryan Organ's portrait stands alone, and now seems to symbolise the world from which she escaped, the tight frame of the background prophetically constricting.\"", "Niall MacMonagle writing in 2014 in the Irish Independent wrote that \"She was \"Shy Di\", still a teenager, when this portrait, by Bryan Organ, was painted. Diana...must have wondered what she was letting herself in for, what was all before her. And she didn't know the half of it. The plumpish cheeks, the big hair, the crossed legs in tailored trousers, the sideways and elegant chair, the ornate classical backdrop combine the traditional and contemporary...Now we know it all, the whole sorry mess. The disappointments, the broken hearts, the affairs. In Roman mythology Diana was the virgin goddess of hunting; in the end, this Diana, modern and unfortunate, was the one hunted and hounded. A victim of circumstance, a prisoner in a gilded cage.
