She has represented Great Britain in the marathon at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics and 2018 European Athletics Championships. Her marathon best of 2:30:42, set in 2017, ranks her in the UK all-time top 25.Barlow did not have a strong background in track and field in her youth and mainly took part in sprinting events at school. She only began taking part in club distance running competitions with Thames Valley Harriers in 2008 at the age of 23. She entered the Run to the Beat half marathon in 2010 and ranked in the top 400. She completed her first marathon at the 2011 London Marathon, finishing in 3:52:59 hours and placing 1402nd in the mass race. She steadily improved in 2012, running 3:27:18 hours at the 2012 London Marathon then 3:17:45 at the 2012 Amsterdam Marathon.\nA sub-three hour clocking at the 2013 London Marathon saw her place in the top 50 women in the mass race. She began working with coach Nick Anderson in order to improve further and she subsequently dropped her best to 2:54:13 hours at the 2014 London Marathon (placing 27th in the women's mass race) and finished 18th at the 2014 Berlin Marathon with a run of 2:51:29.Barlow worked full-time as a nurse during her early running career, later moving into receptionist and office administration work to enable her to train more effectively. She established herself as an elite level runner in 2015. At the 2015 London Marathon she ran 2:39:56 to place fourth in the mass race (and 22nd among all women). She then knocked a minute off her best at the Toronto Waterfront Marathon with a run of 2:38:49 for 13th place. A stand-out performance of 2:33:20 to win the women's mass race at the 2016 London Marathon meant she was four minutes clear of any other woman in the mass race, and faster than Olympians Freya Ross and Ren\u00e9 Kalmer had run in the elite race.She reduced her office work to part-time in January 2017 before turning fully professional as a runner at age 31 in March. The change proved successful as she placed 16th in the elite race of the 2017 London Marathon, setting a personal best of 2:30:42 and gaining selection for the 2017 World Championships in Athletics as Britain's third fastest woman (behind Charlotte Purdue and Alyson Dixon). At the World Championships race held in London, she finished 43rd in her international debut. The following year she placed ninth at the 2018 London Marathon and represented Great Britain at the 2018 European Athletics Championships, taking 15th place in a time of 2:35:00 and leading the British women to fourth in the team competition. She fell down the rankings at the 2019 London Marathon, running 2:36:26 for 19th place (fourth fastest Briton).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tracy Barlow", "response": ["200px|right|thumb|Christabel Finch (right) and Holly Chamarette (left) as Tracy Barlow.", "On 13 November 2002, it was announced that Kate Ford had been cast as Tracy. It was reported that Acton was said to be \"devastated\" when she failed to win the part, which instead went to Ford. But whereas Tracy Barlow was a glum-faced teenager, Tracy Preston - as she is now called - is a sexy, sassy and opinionated man-eater. At the same time it was also reported that Tracy would sleep with her mother's former flame Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin). A Coronation Street spokeswoman said Ford, fresh from London's Webber Douglas Academy but originally from north Lancashire, was \"thrilled\" to have landed the role. \"She is very excited to have got the part. The character has changed substantially in the past four years and really hits the ground running. Kate is thrilled.\"", "In 2005, Ford made the decision to leave the serial, but after being promised more \"juicier storylines\", she decided to stay. In January 2006, it was reported by the News of the World, that Ford had again insisted that she will bow out next year when her contract expires. A Coronation Street spokesman told Digital Spy: \"Kate is contracted until next Spring so she's with us for the foreseeable future.\" Bill Ward who plays Charlie Stubbs, the boyfriend of Tracy announced his departure from the serial in June 2006, an ITV spokesperson commented: \"Contrary to press reports Bill\u2019s decision to leave is not linked to the future of the character of Tracy Barlow. Actress Kate Ford is contracted to Coronation Street until March 2007.\" After months of speculation, Ford announced in August 2006 that she was to quit the show the following year. ", "On 19 May 2011, Ford revealed that the main thing driving her Coronation Street alter-ego Tracy Barlow is the desire to have a family with daughter Amy and former husband, Steve. Speaking to TV Times, Ford said that Tracy is feeling as if her meddling is starting to pay off. \"She thinks she can see a shift in Steve, and she knows that his and Becky's relationship is not on firm ground. She's excited because she thinks an opportunity might be presenting itself,\" Ford explained. \"All Tracy wants is for her, Amy and Steve to be a family. She sees that as the key to her fulfilment and happiness. She does love Amy and she's really worried about her mystery illness. When it comes down to it, she will put Amy above anything.\"", "In December 2012, it was announced that an upcoming storyline would see Tracy begin a dangerous relationship with Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), the brother of Carla Connor (Alison King). Speaking of the storyline a Coronation Street source said: \"Tracy and Rob are a match made in soap hell, They will be fiery, passionate and out to cause trouble.\" Baylis went on to say: \"Watch this space\u00a0\u2013 interestingly, Tracy Barlow comes onto his radar.  That is an interesting combination. Without a doubt, he sees something of himself in Tracy and finds her intriguing!\" Ford admitted: \"She [Tracy] likes the fact that he's quite feisty\u00a0\u2013 it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!\" Asked about the kind of a dynamic between Rob and Tracy, Baylis told Digital Spy: \"There's a lot of joyful banter - they challenge each other in a fun way. They're quite similar, they can see those similarities and they do have a lot of fun together. They put a smile on each other's faces, and we'll just have to see how it goes from there.\" Asked if Rob can hold his own when it comes to Tracy, Baylis replied: \"\"Definitely, otherwise he wouldn't get involved. He is aware of the whole situation that happened with Ryan last year, but he's got a few more years on Ryan and he's been round the block a few times. Rob definitely wouldn't get involved in something that he didn't think he could handle. But Rob does have an arrogant side, and he feels like he could deal with anything. That's one of Rob's main flaws. I've really enjoyed working with Kate Ford on the storyline - we've had an absolute blast. We've been working a lot together, and hopefully the working relationship that we've built up behind the scenes will come across on screen. I'm looking forward to seeing that unfold myself.\" When asked how Rob first gets Tracy's attention, Ford told All About Soap: \"Well, Tracy's going off shopping in town and she gets into a taxi at exactly the same time as Rob. She demands that he leave, as it's her taxi and not his. He refuses to move though, and when Steve asks them where they're going and they both say the city centre at the same time, they share a smile and end up going in the cab together. She likes the fact that he's quite feisty - it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!\" Ford also stated that not only is Tracy attracted to Rob, she realises that it would also annoy Michelle (Kym Marsh), adding: \"If he had got out of the taxi, she probably wouldn't have fancied him. He's quite easy on the eye too, of course. Plus, he hangs round with Michelle, and if Tracy and Rob were an item, it would annoy her - that's another good reason for Tracy.\" On Tracy's reaction to being asked out by Rob, she said: \"She's quite annoyed at first and she turns him down. But he persists and he flatters her, so she thinks, why not? I think he's like a nicer version of Charlie, so maybe. He's got the bad lad streak, he's ruthless, but he's nowhere near as cruel as Charlie.\"", "When Tracy was blackmailed by David, Steven Perkins of Lowculture commented: \"It's very incredibly wrong, and yet they're both so vile that it goes right around the loop and goes back to being a thoroughly great idea.\" Fellow Lowculture contributor Nick Linsdell praised Tracy as \"one of the all-time great, completely horrific, self-absorbed soap monsters.\" He deemed her trial testament to the show's writers, as, even with a character who has been part of Coronation Street since birth: \"they've come up with an exit storyline that outdoes all her previous exploits and dragged in half the cast to enjoy the fun.\" Perkins also praised the trial storyline, commenting: \"It makes for quite a nice change to have sat through a soap trial, knowing for once that The Accused was (a) guilty as sin, (b) acting in a deliberate, calculated and premeditated fashion and (c) not trying to frame someone else.\" Alongside this unusual premise, he noted: \"there are probably quite a few people who secretly want to see That Bitch Tracy Barlow finally get hers.\"", "*Tracy Barlow at itv.com"]}, {"page": "2016 London Marathon", "response": ["|align=center| 17 || Tracy Barlow\u2020 ||  || 2:33:25"]}, {"page": "Chester Half Marathon", "response": ["|39||2021|| Sep 19 || Jonathan Escalante-Phillips || 1:06:36 || Tracy Barlow || 1:20:13"]}, {"page": "2018 London Marathon", "response": ["|align=center|9 || Tracy Barlow ||   || 2:32:09"]}, {"page": "Tracy Barlow (athlete)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tracy Barlow (runner)"]}, {"page": "2021 British Athletics Marathon and 20km Walk Trial", "response": ["The women's marathon race included Stephanie Davis, whose personal best of 2:27:40 was the fastest of any athletes at the event.
