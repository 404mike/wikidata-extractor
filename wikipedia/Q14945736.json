Gilbey, wine merchants. He was educated at Eton College, where he successfully took up rowing, stroking the Eton VIII to victory in the Ladies' Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta for three successive years. In 1895 he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was made stroke of the University crew as a freshman. He successfully stroked Oxford to victory over Cambridge in the next three University Boat Races (and was also stroke in 1899 when they lost) and in 1898 was made president of the Oxford University Boat Club.\nAfter leaving Oxford Gold was made Captain of Leander Club from 1898 to 1900. He became a steward of the Henley Regatta in 1909 and joined its management committee in 1919, significantly helping to put the event onto a sound financial footing. He coached eighteen Oxford crews as well as the Leander VIII which won the 1908 Olympic regatta at Henley.
