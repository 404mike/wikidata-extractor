With business partner John Egerton he took over the enterprise established by John Millan. For some years Egerton's office stood on Charing Cross. Books published included works by Jane Austen.Egerton died on 26 August 1830.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jane Austen", "response": ["During her time at Chawton, Jane Austen published four generally well-received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish Sense and Sensibility, which, like all of Jane Austen's novels except Pride and Prejudice, was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author's financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them.Fergus (2014), 6; Raven (2005), 198; Honan (1987), 285\u2013286. The alternative to selling via commission was by selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with Pride and Prejudice.Irvine, 2005 13. Austen's experience with Susan (the manuscript that became Northanger Abbey) where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby & Sons for \u00a310, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing. The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription.  Sense and Sensibility appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\". As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings."]}, {"page": "Pride and Prejudice", "response": ["Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for First Impressions between 1811 and 1812. As nothing remains of the original manuscript, we are reduced to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it is assumed that First Impressions was an epistolary novel.This theory is defended in \"Character and Caricature in Jane Austen\" by DW Harding in Critical Essays on Jane Austen (BC Southam Edition, London 1968) and Brian Southam in  She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around 1811/1812, when she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for \u00a3110 (). In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the \"sufferings and oppositions\" summarised in the final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called \"Pride and Prejudice\", where the phrase appears three times in block capitals. It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.", "Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for \u00a3110 (Austen had asked for \u00a3150). This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensibility on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her \u00a3140, she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around \u00a3450 from just the first two editions of the book."]}, {"page": "Sense and Sensibility", "response": ["In 1811, Thomas Egerton of the Military Library publishing house in London accepted the manuscript for publication in three volumes. Austen paid to have the book published and paid the publisher a commission on sales. The cost of publication was more than a third of Austen's annual household income of \u00a3460 (about \u00a315,000 in 2008 currency). She made a profit of \u00a3140 (almost \u00a35,000 in 2008 currency) on the first edition, which sold all 750 printed copies by July 1813.
