Bill Alley, rumbustious Australian all-rounder, who had deputised as captain in Stephenson's absence in 1964, was not seen as a long-term captain, and Atkinson was released from school duties to take the job for 1965.

Reid and Dick became John Snow's first Test victims on his debut, but Pollard (55) and Taylor (51) added 92 for the seventh wicket. England's reply was built around 119 from Cowdrey and 62 from Dexter, but Collinge finished the innings off with four quick wickets. As at Edgbaston, New Zealand batted much better in their second innings and with 50s from Dowling, Sinclair and Pollard they totalled 347. That left England 216 to win. With 76 for Geoffrey Boycott and an unbeaten 80 from Dexter, the main danger to the win was from the weather, which caused long interruptions on both the final days, England in the end winning with only 15 minutes to spare. The match was Fred Trueman's final Test appearance.

Against Leicestershire at Weston-super-Mare, on a wet pitch, he made 141 in three hours; eight Somerset wickets had fallen for 145 when Greetham was joined by Harold Stephenson, the Somerset captain, and the pair put on 183 for the ninth wicket in 105 minutes. The stand remains the ninth wicket record for Somerset: it was equalled, but not surpassed, in 1990 by Chris Tavare and Neil Mallender.

Lindo played for Nottinghamshire's second eleven in the Second Eleven Championship in 1960 (though not in second eleven matches in the Minor Counties Championship), but did not win a recall to the first team or a renewal of his contract at the end of the season. In 1963, Lindo reappeared in senior cricket again, playing for Somerset, though again he was largely confined to the second team. As before, he had a single first-class match, this time in the game against the Pakistan Eaglets, a touring side of young players from Pakistan, some of whom went on to become Test players. In a Somerset side that also featured several younger players alongside the established Peter Wight and the Test bowler Fred Rumsey, Lindo made an unbeaten 23 when Somerset batted in a match affected by rain, and then took eight wickets for 88 runs in the Pakistan Eaglets' only innings, including those of future Test players Mushtaq Mohammad and Sadiq Mohammad. The bowling included a spell of five wickets for one run in 17 deliveries with the second new ball. Despite this performance, and with Somerset's bowling very strong, Lindo was not picked for the first team again, and did not play any further first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Fred Rumsey (1965\u20131967) : F.

Mervyn Kitchen and Graham Burgess each batted well to propel Somerset to a score of 251 for nine.

Somerset's second round match against Warwickshire, in Birmingham, took three days to complete. Somerset batted first again, and scored 206 for eight. No batsmen particularly stood out; Roy Virgin, Bill Alley and Colin Atkinson all made scores in the forties, while Kitchen scored 35, and no other batsman reached double figures. Warwickshire then reached 84 for four just short of halfway through their overs when the game was postponed due to inclement weather. Cricket at the time was not played on Sundays, and no further play was possible on Monday, so the game continued on Tuesday, when economical bowling from Fred Rumsey, along with the wickets taken by Alley on the first day, helped to restrict Warwickshire to 181 runs. Somerset batted first again in their quarter final match against Northamptonshire, but only managed to score 184 runs. No Somerset player managed to score more than 40 runs during the innings. The Somerset bowlers played well in comparison; Rumsey took four wickets, while Alley conceded only eight runs from his twelve overs, and Northamptonshire were bowled out for 148. Somerset once again had no stand-out batting performance in their semi-final; Kitchen was their highest scorer with 40 runs, as they posted 210 for seven in a rain-interrupted innings which continued into the second day of the match.
