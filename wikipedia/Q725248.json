I do not know that he approves of polygamy, only he is liberal enough to say that if men are to claim sexual freedom then it should be accorded to women also. The story answers the question when followed to its logical conclusions, and shows very clearly that women have nothing to gain and everything to lose by renouncing the protection which legal marriage gives.Thomas Hardy approved more of Allen's progressive aims in the novel, than of their artistic realisation.M.

Kollmann, of Basel, in his Pygmden in Europa (1894), argues for the existence of a European pygmy race in Neolithic times A notable proponent of the theory who had read MacRitchie's earlier works published in the Celtic Review was Grant Allen, who became convinced that fairies were modelled on an indigenous population of Britain, specifically the Neolithic long barrow makers.Macculloch, 1932, p. 362.\"Who were the Fairies\", Cornhill Magazine, 1881, xliii. 338f. The archaeologist William Boyd Dawkins found MacRitchie's views also appealing, since in his Early Man in Britain and His Place in the Tertiary Period (1880) he considered Upper Paleolithic culture across Europe (including Britain) to have been founded by a proto-Eskimo or Lapp race, a view at the time which was popularised after the discovery of \"Chancelade Man\", in southwestern France by Leo Testut in 1889.\"The Arrival of Man in Britain in the Pleistocene Age\", W. Boyd Dawkins, The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 40, Jul. \u2013 Dec. 1910, pp. 233\u2013263.Recherches anthropologiques sur le Squelette quaternaire de Chancelade, Bull. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Lyon, 1889. Scientific consensus after the 1930s, however, agreed that the remains of \"Chancelade Man\" were Cro-Magnon. Within folklore, MacRitchie's euhemeristic view of fairies developed a racialist school which considered that the fairies and other beings such as elves and goblins of British myth represented primitive pre-Aryans, a view proposed most notably by John S. Stuart Glennie, Laurence Waddell and Alfred Cort Haddon.Phoenician Origin of the Britons, Scots, and Anglo-Saxons (1924, 2nd ed. 1925), in this work Waddell cites MacRitchie.Silver, 1986, p. 150.Folk Memory Or the Continuity of British Archaeology by Walter Johnson (1908) is another work in this vein.

Adopting Schiller's idea of a connexion between aesthetic activity and play, he seeks to make it the starting-point in tracing the evolution of aesthetic activity.  Play is defined as the outcome of the superfluous energies of the organism: as the activity of organs and faculties which, owing to a prolonged period of inactivity, have become specially ready to discharge their function, and as a consequence vent themselves in simulated actions.  Aesthetic activities supply a similar mode of self-relieving discharge to the higher organs of perception and emotion; and they further agree with play in not directly subserving any processes conducive to life; in being gratifications sought for their own sake only.  Spencer seeks to construct a hierarchy of aesthetic pleasures according to the degree of complexity of the faculty exercised: from those of sensation up to the revived emotional experiences which constitute the aesthetic sentiment proper.  Among the more vaguely revived emotions Spencer includes more permanent feelings of the race transmitted by heredity; as when he refers the deep and indefinable emotion excited by music to associations with vocal tones expressive of feeling built up during the history of our species.  This biological treatment of aesthetic activity has had a wide influence, some e.g. Grant Allen being content to develop his evolutional method.  Yet, as suggested above, his theory is now recognized as taking us only a little way towards an adequate understanding of our aesthetic experience."]}, {"page": "Linda Condon", "response": ["* Grant Allen: The Woman Who Did (novel)"]}, {"page": "List of female detective characters", "response": ["* Lois Cayley is an adventurous young woman in an early mystery novel by Grant Allen (1899).", "* Hilda Wade is a nurse who solves crimes with a medical theme in stories by Grant Allen (early 20th century)."]}, {"page": "Edward Clodd", "response": ["Clodd had a talent for friendship, and liked to entertain his friends at literary gatherings in Aldeburgh at his seafront home there, Strafford House, during Whitsuntides.
