However, he failed to break into the club's first team, and was eventually loaned to Annan Athletic and later Albion Rovers. Following an extended loan period at Rovers, Lawless joined Partick Thistle in 2012, where he played a significant part in helping Thistle to achieve promotion to the Scottish Premiership in 2013. In 2018, he signed for Livingston, where he spent two seasons before joining English club Burton Albion.

Thistle subsequently went into the Scottish Premiership play-offs against Livingston, who had finished second in the Scottish Championship in their first season of returning to the league. On 17 May 2018, Thistle lost the first leg 2\u20131 away at Almondvale Stadium, with Kris Doolan getting Thistle's goal. Livingston then came to face Thistle at Firhill on 20 May 2018. Livingston won the away leg 0\u20131 after Keaghan Jacobs scored in the 46th minute. Thistle were relegated to the Scottish Championship after a stay in the top flight of five years. Subsequently, speculation surrounded whether or not Archibald would remain as Thistle's manager. On 24 May, Thistle announced on their website Archibald would remain as Partick Thistle's manager going into the Championship next season. As a result of Thistle's poor season, a number of players were not offered a new contract by the club including captain Abdul Osman, Callum Booth, Steven Lawless, Mustapha Dumbuya, Paul McGinn and Ryan Scully. Transfer listed players were Adam Barton, Niall Keown and Miles Storey. Australian midfielder Ryan Edwards triggered a relegation contract clause, allowing him to leave the club immediately. After a poor start to their 2018\u201319 Scottish Championship season, Archibald was sacked as manager on 6 October 2018 following a 2\u20130 loss to Ross County, leaving Thistle 8th in the Championship."]}, {"page": "Alan Archibald", "response": ["On 7 May 2016, Thistle secured their Premiership status with a 2\u20130 away victory to Kilmarnock, with goals coming from Steven Lawless and Kris Doolan.
