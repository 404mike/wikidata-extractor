As a part of her doctorate work, she did field research in Malabar district from 1947 to 1949. She did further research in Tanjore district from 1950 to 1953 and again in 1976, and in Vietnam in 1976 and 1982. In addition, some of her work included campaigning for: nuclear disarmament, the civil rights movement, women's rights, the third world and the end of the Vietnam War.

The Nair include several castes and many subdivisions, not all of whom historically bore the name 'Nair'.Fuller (1975) p. 309 These people lived, and continue to live, in the area which is now the Indian state of Kerala. Their internal caste behaviours and systems are markedly different between the people in the northern and southern sections of the area, although there is not very much reliable information on those inhabiting the north.Fuller (1975) p. 284", "The Nairs identify themselves as being in many subgroups and there has been debate regarding whether these groups should be considered as subcastes or a mixture both of those and of subdivisions. There have been several attempts to identify these various groups; most of these were prior to the end of British governance in India but Kathleen Gough also studied the issue in 1961. These analyses bear similarities to the Jatinirnayam, a Malayam work that enumerated 18 main subgroups according to occupation, including drummers, traders, coppersmiths, palanquin bearers, servants, potters and barbers, as well as ranks such as the Kiriyam and Illam. Although the Jatinirnayam did not itself distinguish any particular subgroups as ranking higher, subsequent attempts at classification did do so, claiming the various occupations to be traditional ones and stating that only the higher ranked groups were soldiers. Anthropologists, ethnologists and other authors believe that the last name of a Nair was a title which denoted the subgroup (vibhagam) to which that person belonged and indicated the occupation the person pursued or was bestowed on them by a chief or king. These names included Nair itself, Kurup, Menon, and Pillai.Fuller (1975) pp. 286\u2013289"]}, {"page": "Justice Party (India)", "response": ["Historians differ about the extent of British influence in the evolution of the non-Brahmin movement. Kathleen Gough argues that although England played a role, the Dravidian movement had a bigger influence in South India. Eugene F. Irschick (in Political and Social Conflict in South India; The non-Brahmin movement and Tamil Separatism, 1916\u20131929) holds the view that British officials sought to instigate the growth of non-Brahminism, but does not characterise it as simply a product of that policy. David. A. Washbrook disagrees with Irschick in The Emergence of Provincial Politics: The Madras Presidency 1870\u20131920, and states \"Non-Brahminism became for a time synonymous with anti-nationalism\u2014a fact which surely indicates its origins as a product of government policy.\" Washbrook's portrayal has been contested by P.

At a 1981 talk in Tokyo, Amin praised Pol Pot's work as \"one of the major successes of the struggle for socialism in our era\" and as necessary against \"expansionism\" from the Soviet Union or from Vietnam. Some scholars, such as Marxist anthropologist Kathleen Gough, have noted that Khmer Rouge activists in Paris in the 1950s already held ideas of eliminating counter-revolutionaries and organizing a party center whose decisions could not be questioned. Despite contemporary reports of mass killings committed by the Khmer Rouge, Amin argued that \"the cause of the most evil to the people of Kampuchea\" lay elsewhere:The humanitarian argument is in the final analysis the argument offered by all the colonialists...

However, there was little in common between the local chiefdoms of the earlier period and the imperial-like states of Rajaraja Chola and his successors. Aside from the early capital at Thanjavur and the later on at Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Kanchipuram and Madurai were considered to be regional capitals in which occasional courts were held.

Along with the framework given, Rich sets to define the term lesbianism by giving three separate definitions for the term. First, Rich sees lesbian existence as an act of resistance to this institution, but also as an individual choice, when in fact, the principles of radical lesbianism see lesbianism as necessary and consider its existence as necessarily outside of the heterosexual political sphere of influence. Next that, \"Lesbian Identity is the sense of self of a woman bonded primarily to women who is sexually and emotionally independent of men.\" Lastly, that the concept of a lesbian continuum, suggests that female sexual bonding is the only way that women experience women identification. The lesbian continuum is the overall \"range\u2014through each woman's life and throughout history\u2014of woman-identified experiences, not simply the fact that a woman has had or consciously desired genital sexual experience with another woman\".

Nonetheless, communities in the region frequently sought to prove a historic higher status, based on myth or occasionally probable history. He notes that \"traditions of demotion from a once higher rank are a commonplace of South Indian caste mythologies\". Researcher Lloyd I. Rudolph notes that as early as in 1833, the Vanniyar, who were then known as Pallis, had ceased to accept their \"low caste\" status, also described as being Shudra by Christophe Jaffrelot and Kathleen Gough.

The Nairs and, where applicable, the Mapillas ranked socially and ritually higher than the polluting castes. From their study based principally around one village and published in 2000, the Osellas noted that the movements of the late 19th- and 20th centuries brought about a considerable change for the Ezhavas, with access to jobs, education and the right to vote all assisting in creating an identity based on more on class than caste, although the stigmatic label of avarna remained despite gaining the right of access to temples."]}, {"page": "Kaniyar", "response": ["Kathleen Gough has recorded that the caste believes that they descended from a degraded section of the Tamil Brahmins and that they ascribed their \"rudimentary\" knowledge of Sanskrit, medicine and astrology to those origins.

Among the Namboodiris only the eldest son was permitted to marry (Veli, or Vedic Vivaha) within own caste (primogeniture) to maintain the integrity of ancestral property. The remaining younger sons contracted Sambandhams with Kshatriya or Samantan princesses, Ambalavasi or Nair ladies. Since the offspring of these alliances were, as per Marumakkathayam, legally members of their mothers castes and families, the Namboodiri father would not be legally obliged to provide for them, but in most cases would give a part of self acquired property. This was known as Putravakasham (son's right) or Acchankoduthathu (father's gift). For the matrilineal castes in turn Sambandhams with Brahmins were a matter of prestige and social status. Thus Sambandham was in both ways a gain to the castes involved. Namboodiri-Kshatriya and Namboodiri-Nair Sambandhams may also be considered morganatic marriages for while the husband was of higher social status and the mother of relatively lower status, the children were still considered legitimate although they did not inherit the titles or wealth of their fathers.
