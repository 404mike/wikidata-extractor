He later worked as a traveling cricket coach, and by 1894, he was working in Philadelphia. While in the United States, Attewell played further first-class matches in 1894, making two appearances for the Players of United States of America against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, one appearance for RH Powell's XI against GS Patterson's XI, and once appearance for AM Wood's XI against GS Patterson's XI.

He worked initially under Walter Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional, and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright.Brookes, p. 64 Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: \"Because of Alington I call myself\u00a0... an old Salopian\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 81 Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea.Daniels, p. 15 In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.Brookes, p. 65 and Cardus: Autobiography, p. 81"]}, {"page": "Attewell", "response": ["*Walter Attewell, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Attewell", "response": ["His brother William played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, as well as Test cricket for England.
