He won 15 caps for Wales and was selected for the 1930 British Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand. He captained the Welsh team on nine occasions.\nBassett was not the fastest full back, but had a great positional sense on the field which ensured he was always close to the action. He was seen as one of the most devastating tacklers in the game, and many opposing backs would throw the ball into touch rather than allow Bassett to hit them in full flow.", "link_mentions": {}}}
