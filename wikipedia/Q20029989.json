The second vote, on 9 February 1963, succeeded, 1,039 to 427. Oxford student Judith Okely, who had led the campaign to admit women, then became the first woman member.

She also distinguishes the group of \"verandah anthropologists\", who visited new places, but did not learn the language of the people they observed, depending on interpreters and rarely interacting with their subjects. Here, Malinowski's proverbial innovation was moving \"from verandah to tent, which he pitched in the centre of the village\"."]}]}}
