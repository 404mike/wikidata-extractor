Moorsom's survey of the valley of the Ouse allowed the railway line to be straightened, and eliminated the need for a large embankment.  This feat attracted the attention of Robert Stephenson. He then spent two years studying new railway lines all over the country and in 1836 undertook a survey of the country between Birmingham and Gloucester in order to build a railway. The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had found Brunel's proposals out of its financial reach.  Moorsom's brief in 1836 was to build the line as cheaply as possible, which he did by following open country, thereby avoiding populated areas where land prices were higher.  Arriving at the Lickey Hills there was no option but to climb, using cable assistance if necessary."]}, {"page": "Robert Moorsom", "response": ["Robert Moorsom died peacefully in 1835 as a full Admiral of the Blue22 July 1830 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath2 January 1815 and was buried at St Peter's Church, Cosgrove, Northamptonshire,Memorial plaque: St Peter\u2019s Church where a memorial plaque to him and his wife Eleanor (sister of cotton milling entrepreneur Jonathan Scarth) can still be seen.
