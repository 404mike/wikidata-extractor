Chrissie first interacts with the Mitchell Brothers when Grant confronts her in the pub one night over Sam's wrongful incarnation for Den's murder. Grant then attacks Dennis when he intervenes, but then Sharon arrives to see what is happening; she defends Chrissie against the Mitchell Brothers by kicking them out of the pub. Even when Phil and Grant continue to pressure Chrissie over what she did to Den and Sam respectively, Chrissie remains unfazed as Sharon still supports her. This is soon tested, however, when Grant convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison to hear her version of what happened the night Den died. After initially refusing to believe the Mitchells again afterwards, Sharon finally learns the truth when Chrissie innocuously lets slip of the last words that she said to Den on the night he died \"I may not be the first woman in your life, but I'm defiantly going to be the last!\"; Sam had earlier told Sharon this during their conversation in prison. When Chrissie is notified that Sharon has been spending most of her time with Phil and Grant lately, she realizes that Sharon knows the truth at last and is distraught to accept this upon having seen Sharon think so well of her. In a stressful state, Chrissie begins to make mistakes as she plans with Jake to flee the country to avoid getting caught by the authorities. They later have an argument at Johnny's nightclub, \"Scarlets\", where she ends up describing to him how she killed Den with the doorstop. Unbeknownst to the pair, however, Johnny catches this on CCTV and delightfully tells Jake that he has a recording of her confession. Chrissie later goes to visit Johnny and asks to get the money for their deal on the pub right away, but Johnny instead takes advantage by telling Chrissie that she must sleep with him in order to get the money. Chrissie tries to resist by reminding Johnny of her knowledge that he killed Andy, before later bringing up the fact that his former mistress Tina Stewart (Charlotte Avery) had just recently broke up with him over his recent affair with Amy (Nina Fry) \u2014 one of his barmaids at Scarletts. Johnny calls her buff, however, and Chrissie initially complies until she does not fully go through with it by stating how she does not want to hurt Jake. In response to this, Johnny tells Chrissie that she will not receive the money and ends up telling Phil and Grant about the tape."]}, {"page": "Johnny Allen (EastEnders)", "response": ["When Johnny's former mistress Tina Stewart (Charlotte Avery) arrives in to Walford to recommence their relationship, Ruby becomes upset after discovering this.

During this time, he plans to expand his business empire by putting in an offer for The Queen Vic.
