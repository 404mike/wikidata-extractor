His usual position was as a back-row forward, either at blind-side flanker or at Number 8, positions he occupied for both Wales and his club sides, Neath RFC and Rhigos RFC.\nDuring his time in the Wales team, Morris won three Five Nations Championships (one shared with France), including two Triple Crowns and one Grand Slam.\nIn 2002, Morris was voted into an all-time greatest Welsh XV at the blindside flanker position.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Max Boyce", "response": ["This early pinnacle in Boyce's career coincided with the dominance of the Welsh rugby team in the Five Nations Championship during the 1970s. His songs and poems were real-time reflections on this unfolding history, often invoking the names of Welsh rugby greats such as Barry John, Gareth Edwards and Dai Morris. Songs such as \"Hymns and Arias\" soon became popular with rugby crowds, a fact which has played a significant part in his ongoing popularity. When Swansea City were promoted to the English Premier League in 2011, Boyce was asked to perform for their first game and produced a special version of \"Hymns and Arias\" for the occasion."]}, {"page": "Barry John", "response": ["John played infrequently for Cardiff during the 1968/69 season, making just 14 appearances.Davies (1976) p. 158 Despite this he was available for all matches in the 1969 Five Nations Championship, again playing in each match paired with Edwards. The Welsh selectors had dropped five players from the previous Championship, and notable debutants in the team to face Scotland at Murrayfield on 1 February 1969 were J.P.R. Williams and Mervyn Davies. John scored his first international try in the encounter after charging down a kick and dummying his way over. Scotland, who were under enormous pressure from the kick-off, lost 17\u20133.Godwin (1984) p. 341 When Ireland came to the Cardiff Arms Park in March the team was on a seven match unbeaten run, and were looking at taking the Grand Slam after defeating England, France and Scotland. It therefore came as a surprise at the ease with which the Welsh pack dominated.Godwin (1984) p. 343 Wales won 24\u201311, with Dai Morris the stand-out Welsh player, though John also had one of his best matches, keeping pressure on the Irish with long touch kicks and scoring with a dropped goal. Despite out-scoring France in tries scored, the match at Stade Colombes ended in an 8\u20138 draw, preventing a Welsh Grand Slam, though a win in the last match to England would give Wales the Championship. The England decider is best remembered for Maurice Richards' four tries, but John too was on the scoresheet with a dropped goal and a try of his own. The game finished 30\u20139 to Wales, giving John his first Championship title and made him a Triple Crown winning player, as Wales had beaten all three other Home Nation teams.Godwin (1984) p. 344"]}, {"page": "Neath RFC", "response": ["*  Dai Morris", "TP Whittington, Brian Williams, Brian Thomas, Shane Williams, Steve Powell and Dai Morris"]}, {"page": "Rhigos", "response": ["Rhigos has produced some international rugby players, most notably Dai Morris, who played for Rhigos RFC and Neath RFC.
