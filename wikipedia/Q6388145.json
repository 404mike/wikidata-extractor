He has also raised concerns about the AIDS Council, and questioned Gail Gago on why the Government was funding an organization that demands job applicants use drugs and participate in prostitution as a mandatory prerequisite for employment. Earlier, Hood attacked the AIDS Council for stating \"children are a blessing [because] you never know when you'll need someone to go out and score [drugs] for you,\" and that \"alcohol is fun, but take drugs instead and you will remember your night out,\" in what Christopher Pyne concurred as \"foolish and irresponsible.\" Hood also voted not to provide Auditor-General Ken McPherson, who drafted the report into corruption and bullying at the Burnside Council, an extension of the term, as he has already served 21 years. Equally, Hood has encouraged the injection of capital into Government units that look after vulnerable people who are abused in state care."]}, {"page": "List of Swindon Town F.C. players", "response": ["|Ken McPherson ||||MF||1961\u201365 ||121||6"]}, {"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["In January 1955 the club announced that Jesse Carver was to be the new manager, a role he began in June of that year with George Raynor as his assistant. Carver had achieved success with several clubs in Italy, including Juventus, Torino, and Roma, and began life at Coventry with the goal of taking the club to Division One. There was huge anticipation and optimism amongst the supporters that summer and a crowd of almost 25,000 attended the opening game against Bournemourth. The first part of the season was mixed, with good results at home offset by a poor away record. Carver signed forward Ken McPherson and, following a five wins in a row, the club were challenging for promotion by the end of the year. On 30 December, however, the board made a shock announcement that Carver was to leave the club. They cited health reasons for his departure, and chairman Shanks insisted at the press conference that he was not leaving to pursue opportunities overseas. But, within days, Carver announced that he was to become the new Lazio manager and it was later revealed that he had been unhappy in the Midlands and seeking a move back to Italy since September. Raynor took over as manager until the end of the season."]}, {"page": "List of Notts County F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Ken McPherson"]}, {"page": "List of Newport County A.F.C. players", "response": ["*  Ken McPherson"]}]}}
