In 1822, his parents moved to Glasgow where he attended the grammar-school and  acquired a good knowledge of the Latin language. He began the study of medicine in the Andersonian university of Glasgow in 1829 eventually becoming a surgeon.\nIn 1836, encouraged by William Hooker  he brought out a work, entitled Musci Britannici, or Pocket Herbarium of British Mosses arranged and named according to Hooker\u2019s \"British Flora\" His botanical work impressed  Duke of Bedford who became his patron and in the summer of 1836 Gardner sailed from Liverpool for  Rio de Janeiro to collect plants, minerals, recent and fossil shells, preserved skins of birds, mammals, fishes and other natural history specimens in North Brazil. The specimens were sent to public botanic gardens, as well as to private subscribers, to the expedition. He stayed in Brazil for years (1836\u20131841). In 1842 he was elected a Member of the Linnean Society.\nIn 1843, he was appointed to Ceylon, as superintendent of the botanic garden in Peradeniya and island botanist, by the colonial government. Here he finished  \"Travels in the Interior of Brazil, principally through the Northern Provinces and the Gold Districts, during the years 1836\u201341\" published in London, by Reeves Brothers, in 1846. He had made extensive collections towards a complete \"Flora Zeylanica\" not published because of his early death.\n\n Species named for Gardner are titled gardneri.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ardentinny", "response": ["*George Gardner, botanist, was born in Ardentinny in 1810."]}, {"page": "Gardner (surname)", "response": ["* George Gardner (disambiguation), several people", "** George Gardner (coach), American football and basketball coach", "** George Gardner (botanist) (1810\u20131849), Scottish naturalist", "** George Gardner (ice hockey) (1942\u20132006), Canadian goaltender", "** George Gardiner (boxer) (1877\u20131954), American boxer, also known as \"George Gardner\"", "** George Gardner (priest), English Anglican priest", "** George Gardiner (settler) (c. 1610\u20131677), a founding settler of Newport, Rhode Island, also known as \"George Gardner\""]}, {"page": "Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya", "response": ["Thereafter, the groundwork for a botanical garden was formed by Alexandar Moon in 1821.

In the Introduction to \"Ceylon\" Tennent writes \"Respecting the Physical Geography and Natural History of the colony, I found an equal want of reliable information; and every work that even touched on the subject was pervaded by the misapprehension which I have collected evidence to correct; that Ceylon is but a fragment of the great Indian continent dissevered by some local convulsion; and that the zoology and botany of the island are identical with those of the mainland. Thus for almost every particular and fact, whether physical or historical, I have been to a great extent thrown on my own researches; and obliged to seek for information in original sources, and in French and English versions of Oriental authorities. The results of my investigations are embodied in the following pages; and it only remains for me to express, in terms however inadequate, my obligations to the literary and scientific friends by whose aid I have been enabled to pursue my inquiries\". Collaborators resident in Ceylon include, especially the Belfast born naturalist Robert Templeton and like Tennent a  fellow Member of the Belfast Natural History Society who is thanked thus for his cordial assistance in numerous departments; but above all in relation to the physical geography and natural history of the island. Here his scientific knowledge, successfully cultivated during a residence of nearly twelve years in Ceylon, and his intimate familiarity with its zoology and productions, rendered his co-operation invaluable. Others were  Dr. Cameron, of the Army Medical Staff (as was Templeton), Dr. Davy \"when connected with the medical staff of the army from 1816 to 1820\", William Ferguson, Esq., employed by the Survey Department of the Civil Service in Ceylon and a botanist, George Gardner and  George Henry Kendrick Thwaites of  the Botanic Gardens in Peradeniya, Edward Frederick Kelaart  Edgar Leopold Layard as well as from officers of the Ceylon Civil Service; the Hon.

Initially thinking it was a firefly, he then discovered it was a mushroom\u2014known as Flor de Coco locally\u2014that was common locally and found on decaying palm leaves. Gardner sought to call it Agaricus phosphorescens. However, his colleague Miles Joseph Berkeley opined that the attribute was not unique, and hence described it with the specific name A.\u00a0gardneri. Gardner thought it resembled members of the genus Pleurotus in structure, while Berkeley felt it was more akin to the genus Panus but conceded spores were necessary for further classification."]}, {"page": "George Gardner", "response": ["George Gardner may refer to:", "* George Gardner (coach) (1898\u20131974), American football and basketball coach", "* George Gardner (botanist) (1810\u20131849), Scottish naturalist", "* George Gardner (ice hockey) (1942\u20132006), Canadian goaltender", "* George Gardiner (boxer) (1877\u20131954), American boxer, also known as \"George Gardner\"", "* George Gardner (priest) (1853\u20131925), English Anglican priest", "* George Gardiner (settler) (1608/1615\u20131677), founding settler of Newport, Rhode Island, also known as \"George Gardner\""]}, {"page": "Schlumbergera russelliana", "response": ["The species was discovered for science in Brazil in 1837 by George Gardner, whose patron was John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford.
