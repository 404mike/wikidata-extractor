Making his debut in 1983, he was once considered to be somewhat dim and irresponsible, wearing a gorilla suit at a hunt ball in 1983, inadvertently joy riding with Shula Archer in 1984 and driving an ice-cream van as 'Mr Snowy' in 1986. Initially, Nigel was romantically linked with Shula (or \"Shulie\" as he called her), but in 1984 he became involved with Elizabeth Archer, finding her totally unlike Shula: she tricked him into helping her abscond from school in September 1984. On the death of his father a few years later, he strove to save his ancestral home, and involved Elizabeth, now also more mature, as his marketing manager. He saved the hall for his family. Married to Elizabeth for some years and the father of twins Lily and Freddie (born 12 December 1999), he was convicted of drink-driving in 2003. Nigel (who also had a never-seen sister, Camilla who was married to a man named James) had only intermittent help from his beloved mother, Julia; more often she was a source of anxiety and friction (due to her dislike of Elizabeth, which, happily ceased once Freddie and Lily were born), but she died suddenly in November 2005. Nigel developed a number of vague resemblances to Prince Charles. He became concerned about the environment and tried to become \"green\". He also took an interest in his family history, particularly in his late Uncle Rupert. Nigel died after falling from the roof of Lower Loxley Hall while attempting, after an evening party, to take down a New Year's banner in icy conditions. The accident occurred as part of The Archers 60th anniversary broadcast on 2 January 2011. Nigel's demise was satirised in Radio 4's News Quiz Christmas Pantomime in December of that year."]}, {"page": "List of longest-serving soap opera actors", "response": ["| Graham Seed || Nigel Pargetter || The Archers || 1983\u20131986, 1992\u20132011 ||  years || "]}, {"page": "Vanessa Whitburn", "response": ["The 60th anniversary of the programme was billed as containing developments to \"shake Ambridge to the core\", which turned out to be long-term character Nigel Pargetter (Graham Seed) being killed in an accident."]}, {"page": "List of Jeeves and Wooster characters", "response": ["* Sidney Hemmingway \u2014 Graham Seed (2)"]}, {"page": "Accolade (play)", "response": ["Accolade is a 1950 play by the Welsh playwright Emlyn Williams.
