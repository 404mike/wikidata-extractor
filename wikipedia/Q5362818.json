She has been described by the trade as someone \"whose large rings, historical references, gorgeous stones and elaborate craftsmanship set the tone for a whole generation\".Elizabeth Gage works in 18 and 22 carat gold. Her 'Helios' gold necklace, featured in Tatler magazine, took 203 grams of gold and 93 man hours to create. Elizabeth\u2019s approach to design is as unique as the jewels themselves. She combines different elements in her work which she chooses for their individual beauty; exquisite stones, ancient bronzes, beautiful carvings, baroque pearls, in fact anything where the shape and colour inspire her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Casper Meets Wendy || 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment / The Harvey Entertainment Company / Saban Entertainment / Brookwell McNamara Entertainment || Sean McNamara (director); Jymn Magon (screenplay); Hilary Duff, Cathy Moriarty, Shelley Duvall, Teri Garr, George Hamilton, Richard Moll, Vincent Schiavelli, Pauly Shore, Blake Foster, Jeremy Foley, Jim Ward, Bill Farmer, Jess Harnell, Logan Robbins, Michael McDonald, Patrick Richwood, Travis McKenna, Rodger Halston, Alan Thicke, Bob Saget, Casper Van Dien, Billy Burnette, Maria Ford, Jim Wise, Patricia Elliott, Rodman Flender, Elizabeth Gage, Larry Robbins || Fantasy, Family, Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Romantic fiction writers/to do", "response": ["Elizabeth Gage -"]}, {"page": "Casper Meets Wendy", "response": ["* Elizabeth Gage as Swift Dancer"]}, {"page": "Patricia Maxwell", "response": ["*\"Love in Three-Quarter Time\" in Unmasked, 1997 (with Janet Dailey and Elizabeth Gage)"]}, {"page": "Janet Dailey", "response": ["* Unmasked (1997) (with Jennifer Blake and Elizabeth Gage)"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth gage", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Gage "]}, {"page": "List of jewellery designers", "response": ["* Elizabeth Gage"]}, {"page": "2017 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Elizabeth Gage, Jeweller.
