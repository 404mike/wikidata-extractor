With the Fairlight, short digital sound recordings called samples could be \"played\" through a piano-like keyboard, while a computer processor altered such characteristics as pitch and timbre. Music producer Trevor Horn was among the first people to purchase a Fairlight. While some musicians were using samples as adornment in their works, Horn and his colleagues saw the potential to craft entire compositions with the sampler, disrupting the traditional rock aesthetic. (Others were also working contemporaneously toward this goal, such as Jean-Michel Jarre, Yello, and Tony Mansfield, who had made extensive use of the Fairlight for the eponymous debut album by Naked Eyes, while Yellow Magic Orchestra had extensively used sampling on their 1981 album Technodelic)."]}, {"page": "Jean Paul Gaultier", "response": ["In 1988, Gaultier released a dance single titled \"How To Do That\" on Fontana Records, from which came one of the first ever \"single title\" remix albums, Aow Tou Dou Zat, on Mercury Records.
