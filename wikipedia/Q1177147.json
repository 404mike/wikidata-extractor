This boutique label (whose very high profile in France has not yet been matched by commercial success) has helped define the \"Burgalat sound\", which has been billed as a French response to Phil Spector, and has been a major influence on acts such as Air and Daft Punk. Struggling with distribution problems, and despite the huge critical acclaim gained by many of its releases, Tricatel has downsized its activities over the past two years, concentrating on acts such as A.S. Dragon, new signing Les Shades, and Bertrand Burgalat himself, who is currently (January 2007) working on a follow-up to 'Portrait-Robot'. Other notable artists in the Tricatel catalogue include Swedish avant-pop trio Eggstone, The High Llamas, Ingrid Caven, and award-winning novelist Jonathan Coe, who teamed up with Louis Philippe and jazz pianist/double-bass player Danny Manners for the occasion. Tricatel has also released compilations of some of Burgalat's musical heroes, such as French composer Andr\u00e9 Popp and legendary English arranger and soundtrack composer David Whitaker. Bertrand Burgalat picked the name \"Tricatel\" from a successful French comedy of the 1970s, L'Aile ou la Cuisse, starring Louis de Fun\u00e8s and Coluche."]}, {"page": "Versus (Kings of Convenience album)", "response": ["# \"Toxic Girl\" (string arrangement by David Whitaker) \u2013 3:06"]}, {"page": "The Last Time (Rolling Stones song)", "response": ["In 1965, Andrew Oldham Orchestra recorded the song for the album The Rolling Stones Songbook.
