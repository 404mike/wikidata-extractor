As a player, Brown was a right-back who made over six hundred league appearances in an eighteen-year career, but never made it to the top flight. However, as a manager, he became the first to lead Hull City to the top division in their 104-year history, winning the Championship play-offs in 2008 after a 1\u20130 win against Bristol City at Wembley Stadium. He also guided Southend United to promotion from League Two to League One in 2014\u201315.\nSince 2011, Brown has appeared as a match summariser on BBC Radio 5 Live as well as the station's sport panel show Fighting Talk, winning for the first time on 5 May 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 30", "response": ["*1959 \u2013 Phil Brown, English footballer, coach, and manager"]}, {"page": "Swindon Town F.C.", "response": ["* Phil Brown 2018"]}, {"page": "Preston North End F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Phil Brown ||align=\"left\"|   || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2011"]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["* 1981  Phil Brown", "* 1982  Phil Brown"]}, {"page": "Southend United F.C.", "response": ["Phil Brown was brought in as Sturrock's successor but picked up just one win in his eight games in charge as Southend finished the season in 11th position, with only six league wins at Roots Hall all season. In 2015 Brown led the team, via a play-off final against Wycombe Wanderers (decided 7\u20136 on penalties), into League One. At the end of the 2016\u20132017 season, the club missed the play-offs for the Championship by only one point.

Phil Brown returned as manager but could not rescue the situation; Southend suffered a second successive relegation on 1 May 2021 with a game to spare despite a 2\u20131 victory at Barrow, dropping out of the Football League after 101 years.

In August 2021, Southend revealed their overall debt in July 2019 was \u00a317.4m, having grown by \u00a32.4m; Martin said the majority of the debt was owed to his companies, and that \u00a36.8m of debt had already been written off. On 21 August 2021, Southend started their first season in the National League with a 1\u20130 victory at King's Lynn Town, but a six-match winless streak had manager Phil Brown fearing for his future, describing Southend as stuck in a massive \"chasm\". On 5 and 9 October 2021, Southend fans staged protests at Roots Hall demanding the departure of chairman Ron Martin; following a 4\u20130 defeat by Chesterfield at Roots Hall on 9 October, Brown was sacked. Collymore offered further free support to the club, described by the BBC as \"a mess\" and \"already on life support\". Defender Jason Demetriou took temporary charge before, on 20 October 2021, Kevin Maher returned to the club as head coach, supported by assistant Darren Currie and Mark Bentley as first team coach. CEO Tom Lawrence also started negotiations with Collymore about a formal role with the club, and he was appointed the club's senior football strategist in early November 2021, with John Still appointed head of football two weeks later. In December 2021, Southend was placed under a National League embargo because of HMRC debts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; after back-to-back relegations and 18 months of reduced income, CEO Lawrence said the club was \"in a deteriorating income position\".", "|2013\u20132018||Phil Brown", "|2021\u20132021||Phil Brown"]}, {"page": "Hull City A.F.C.", "response": ["However, Taylor left the club to take up the manager's job at Crystal Palace and Colchester United's Phil Parkinson was confirmed as his replacement, but was sacked on 4 December 2006 with Hull in the relegation zone, despite having spent over \u00a32\u00a0million on players during the summer.
