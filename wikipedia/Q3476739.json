An England and Great Britain international scrum-half, Long is regarded by many as one of the finest British players of his generation. He began his career with the Wigan Warriors, and also played for the Widnes Vikings and Hull FC, but is best known for his time playing for St Helens in the Super League with whom he won a total of four Super League championships and five Challenge Cups, as well as numerous individual accolades including the Man of Steel award, and three Lance Todd Trophies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2004 in sports", "response": ["* June 17 \u2013 Martin Gleeson and Sean Long are banned for four and three months respectively after placing bets on their side, St. Helens, to lose a Super League match against the Bradford Bulls"]}, {"page": "2000 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["| align=\"right\"|Sean Long", "*  Sean Long"]}, {"page": "Rugby League Tri-Nations", "response": ["|2||Nathan Cayless (NZ), Gareth Ellis (GB), Stuart Fielden (GB), Brad Fittler (Aus), Matthew Gidley (Aus), Shontayne Hape (NZ), Sean Long (GB), Willie Mason (Aus), Terry Newton (GB), Mat Rogers (Aus), Wendell Sailor (Aus), Motu Tony (NZ), Paul Wellens (GB)"]}, {"page": "Martin Gleeson", "response": ["He opened the 2004's Super League IX for St. Helens, and won the Challenge Cup against the Wigan Warriors at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.

He saw them soundly beaten in the 2000 World Club Challenge, losing 44\u20136 to Melbourne, but lead them to retaining their Super League title in 2000 beating Wigan 29\u201316. They also won the Challenge Cup in 2001; 13\u20136 over Bradford, with the final held at Twickenham Stadium for the first time, and the 2001 World Club Challenge, earning a 20\u201318 win over the Broncos. Millward then lead Saints to the top of Super League VII, and to reclaim the Super League title in the 2002 Grand Final, Sean Long snatching a last minute 19\u201318 win over the Bradford with a drop\u2014goal. They lost the 2002 Challenge Cup Final to Wigan at Murrayfield Stadium by 21 points to 12. They were hammered in the 2003 World Club Challenge by Sydney by 38 points to 0. In this season, they failed to win a trophy after being knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Leeds at the semi\u2014final stage, and the Super League play\u2014offs by Wigan at the same stage. In 2004 they beat arch\u2014rivals Wigan 32\u201316 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff in front of a capacity crowd of 73,734 people to win the Challenge Cup, Long gaining his second of an eventual three Lance Todd Trophies.", "St Helens won the 2006 Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham Stadium, beating Huddersfield 42\u201312. Scrum-half Sean Long was awarded the Lance Todd trophy for a record third time for his man\u2014of\u2014the\u2014match performance during the final.", "|7 Sean Long (SH)", "2010 was the year that saw Potter surrender to his critics and leave St. Helens. Criticisms from club legends like Paul Sculthorpe and Sean Long regarding his personal skills with the fans, as well as the continued fan rejection saw him let his contract run out and, initially, seek a job in the NRL, but eventually, and perhaps surprisingly, join Bradford on a two\u2014year contract. Names like Royce Simmons, Mal Meninga, and assistant coach Kieron Purtill, were linked with the job for 2011. Simmons was the chosen man for the job, as announced on 22 July 2010. The 2010 season would also see legendary hooker and captain Keiron Cunningham retire from the game after 17 years with his one and only club. However, Cunningham would not be leaving without leaving a lasting legacy on the club. A life\u2014like bronze statue of Cunningham was built and placed on display in the town, before being transported to the club's new stadium upon its construction in 2012. He would additionally take up a coaching role with the academy, as well as a strength and conditioning role with the first team. In light of these decisions, neither Cunningham nor Potter halted their personal and the St Helens team quest for success; shown by their 10th successive semi\u2014final appearance in the Challenge Cup. However, Saints failure to perform on the big stage was once more shown, going down in this semi\u2014final by 32\u201328. Defeating Huddersfield Giants in the qualifying semi\u2014final in the 2010 play-off series by 42\u201322 not only saw Saints qualify for their fifth Grand Final in five years, but also saw the final ever game to be played at Knowsley Road. Fittingly, Cunningham snatched the final ever try at the famous old ground in typical fashion from dummy\u2014half. However, for the fourth year running, St Helens once more proved flops in the Grand Final. One of the finest finals of the Super League era was anticipated, but the flamboyant Saints that the fans saw so rarely under Potter once more failed to materialise, and, in front of a near sell\u2014out crowd of 71,526, they fell to a 22\u201310 loss to rivals Wigan. It was not the romantic finish to the Saints careers of Potter, Cunningham or any of the departing members of the squad that many had hoped for, but nevertheless, a new era was just around the corner, as Simmons' reign began.", "Australian Royce Simmons took over from compatriot Mick Potter for the start of the 2011 season. As the club awaited completion of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long's replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing an uphill battle on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their 6th consecutive Grand Final. However, for the 5th year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of a new crop of talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell stepping up to fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances."]}, {"page": "Hull F.C.", "response": ["In March 2009 Michael Crocker was denied a visa to come to England to play for Hull F.C..

Lockyer converted the try so it was 6 - 0 in favour of the Kangaroos. A few minutes later Irish winger Brian Carney left the field with a hamstring injury and was replaced by Lee Gilmour. Then Great Britain struck back with scrum-half-back Sean Long dummying his way through the defence thirty-five metres from the line then passing back inside to fullback Paul Wellens to score.

The video referee gave the try 'benefit of the doubt' and Sean Long's kick didn't miss, so the score was 12 - 6 in favour of Great Britain. The Australians hit back with another long range try, the ball being moved out to Inglis on the left wing to make a break down the sideline before passing back inside to five-eighth Darren Lockyer to finish the run to the line and touch down behind the uprights. Lockyer then converted, levelling the score at 12 - 12. About ten minutes later the British struck back when Lee Gilmour hit a gap twenty metres out and ran through to dive over beneath the sticks. Sean Long converted so the Lions regained the lead at 18 - 12. With just over ten minutes remaining Great Britain got an opportunity to put themselves in front by more than a converted try when they were awarded a penalty, but Long's kick missed. Shortly after he got a chance to make amends with a drop goal but missed. However, with less than five minutes remaining he helped seal the match when he kicked a loose pass fifteen metres from his own goal-line downfield and chased after it, regathering and running just over the half-way line before passing it James Roby in support who couldn't outrun Nathan Hindmarsh. From the play-the-ball twenty metres away from Australia's goal-line, the British moved the ball through the hands out to the other side of the field to winger Gareth Raynor who dived over in the corner. Long's conversion attempt struck the post and missed, but he later kicked a field goal in the final minutes to make it a 23 - 12 victory, Great Britain's first in Australia since their 1992 tour."]}, {"page": "Lance Todd Trophy", "response": ["The first winner of the trophy was Wakefield Trinity , Billy Stott in 1945\u201346.
