He renewed the 1902 alliance with Japan in 1911. The centrepiece of his policy was the defence of France against German aggression, while avoiding a binding alliance with Paris. He supported France in the Moroccan crises of 1905 and 1911. Another major achievement was the Anglo-Russian entente of 1907. He resolved an outstanding conflict with Germany over the Baghdad railway in 1913, but successfully convinced the cabinet that Britain had an obligation and was honour-bound to defend France, and prevent Germany from controlling Western Europe in August 1914. Once the war began, there was little role for his diplomacy; he lost office in December 1916. He was a leading British supporter of the League of Nations.\nHe is remembered for his \"the lamps are going out\" remark on 3 August 1914 on the outbreak of the First World War. He signed the Sykes-Picot Agreement on 16 May 1916. He was ennobled in 1916, prior to which he was the 3rd Baronet Grey of Fallodon, and was Ambassador to the United States between 1919 and 1920 and Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords between 1923 and 1924.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 25", "response": ["*1862 \u2013 Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, English ornithologist and politician, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (d. 1933)"]}, {"page": "Liberal Party (UK)", "response": ["* Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1923\u20131924)"]}, {"page": "September 7", "response": ["*1933 \u2013 Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, English ornithologist and politician, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (b. 1862)"]}, {"page": "1933", "response": ["** Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, British statesman (b. 1862)"]}, {"page": "Women's suffrage", "response": ["In 1903 a number of members of the NUWSS broke away and, led by Emmeline Pankhurst, formed the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).Bonnie Kime Scott (2007). \"Gender in modernism: new geographies, complex intersections\" p. 693.

Routledge, 2000 As he was talking, Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney of the WSPU constantly shouted out, \"Will the Liberal Government give votes to women?\" When they refused to cease calling out, police were called to evict them and the two suffragettes (as members of the WSPU became known after this incident) were involved in a struggle which ended with them being arrested and charged for assault. When they refused to pay their fine, they were sent to prison for one week, and three days. The British public were shocked and took notice at this use of violence to win the vote for women."]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Grey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon"]}]}}
