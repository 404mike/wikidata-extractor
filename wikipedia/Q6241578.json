In 1891, artist Gilbert Baird Fraser stood, as did Vivian, as a candidate in East Bradford for the \"Individualist Party\" on a thoroughly Jacobite platform, and Walter Clifford Mellor (the son of John James Mellor MP), as a Jacobite in the North Huntingdonshire constituency. All three candidates lost. In 1895, Vivian stood in North Huntingdonshire as a Jacobite and lost again. In 1906, he was the Liberal candidate for Deptford and lost badly despite the support of his friend Winston Churchill. Finally, in 1907 he explored a candidacy in Stirling Burghs as a Legitimist; this time he withdrew before the election."]}, {"page": "Walter Clifford Mellor", "response": ["#REDIRECT John James Mellor#Family"]}]}}
