After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series. During Goldfinger, Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels."]}, {"page": "Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang", "response": ["In May 1961, Fleming sent his publisher the manuscripts for the first two volumes of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. To illustrate the book, Fleming suggested the Daily Mail cartoonist Trog\u2014the pseudonym of Wally Fawkes\u2014as he admired the artist's work. While undertaking the preliminary drawings for the book, Trog tried to make the fudge recipe included in the book and found it was not particularly good: the editors at Jonathan Cape spent a day making up batches from different recipes to find a better one to use. Although Fawkes completed preliminary drawings for the project, the Daily Mail refused to allow him to complete the work as many of Fleming's works were serialised in its rival, the Daily Express. Other early illustrative sketches were produced by artist Haro Hodson and motor engineer Amherst Villiers. After Trog was forced to withdraw from the project, Cape commissioned John Burningham, who had recently won the 1963 Kate Greenaway Medal for his book Borka: The Adventures of a Goose with No Feathers."]}, {"page": "David Brown (entrepreneur)", "response": ["Upon his return from South Africa Brown decided to design and build his own car. Working in his bedroom each night until 2:00 am, he designed a 1.5-litre twin-cam, straight-eight engine. Then using the firm's foundry, he made patterns and cast the cylinder block, while using the machine shop to produce the other components. His father put a stop to the work when he caught his son working on the project in company time. Undaunted, Brown constructed a chassis, fitting it with a Sage 2-litre engine, coupled to a Meadows gear box. He called the result the \u201cDaybro\u201d. David Brown & Sons' gear-grinding skills brought him early contacts with Bertelli of Aston Martin for gears and Amherst Villiers for his superchargers. With the consent of Villiers, Brown modified a Vauxhall which then won its class at Shelsley Walsh for three consecutive years. It was said to be capable of more than 140\u00a0mph on the sand."]}, {"page": "Casino Royale (2006 film)", "response": ["* Tobias Menzies as Villiers: M's young secretary at MI6 headquarters.

If Bentley wanted a more powerful car he developed a bigger model and the Speed Six was a huge car. Ettore Bugatti once referred to the Bentley as \"the world's fastest lorry\" (\"Le camion plus vite du monde\"). Back in 1928 however, Birkin had come to the conclusion that the future lay in getting more power from a lighter model by fitting a supercharger to the 4\u00bd litre Bentley. When Bentley Motors refused to create the supercharged model Birkin sought he determined to develop it himself. With technical help from Clive Gallop and supercharger specialist Amherst Villiers, and with Dorothy Paget financing the project after his own money had run out, Birkin rebuilt the car at the engineering works he had set up for the purpose at Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. Adding a huge Roots-type supercharger (\"blower\") in front of the radiator driven straight from the crankshaft gave the car a unique appearance. The 242\u00a0bhp \"blower Bentley\" was born."]}, {"page": "Raymond Mays", "response": ["He attended Oundle School, where he met Amherst Villiers, leaving at the end of 1917. After army service in the Grenadier Guards in France, he attended Christ's College, Cambridge, taking his first win at Brooklands while an undergraduate.", "Mays raced for some thirty years, competing in various cars: a Speed-model 1\u00bd-litre Hillman,Motor Sport, December 1941, Page 488. two 1\u00bd-litre Bugattis, an unsuccessful supercharged AC,The Brooklands Gazette, June 1925, Page 467; The Brooklands Gazette, July 1925, Page 22. the Vauxhall-Villiers, Mercedes, Invictas, Rileys and ERAs.Motor Sport, Sept 1951, Page 449. Mays was renowned for competing at Shelsley Walsh, racing there in the early 1920s with a pair of Brescia Bugattis, known as 'Cordon Bleu' and 'Cordon Rouge'. He developed his cars with superchargers through Amherst Villiers and this association continued from AC to the Vauxhall-Villiers and then the famous 'White Riley', that eventually became the starting point for ERA."]}, {"page": "Bentley 4\u00bd Litre", "response": ["Thus the 4\u00bd litre Blower Bentley was born. The first supercharged Bentley had been a 3-litre FR5189 which had been supercharged at the Cricklewood factory in the winter of 1926/7.  The Bentley Blower No.1 was officially presented in 1929 at the British International Motor Show at Olympia, London. The 55 copies were built to comply with 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations. Birkin arranged for the construction of the supercharged cars having received approval from Bentley chairman and majority shareholder Woolf Barnato and financing from wealthy horse racing enthusiast Dorothy Paget. Development and construction of the supercharged Bentleys was done in a workshop in Welwyn Garden City by Amherst Villiers, who also provided the superchargers.", "The essential difference between the Bentley 4\u00bd Litre and the Blower was the addition of a Roots-type supercharger to the Blower engine by engineer Amherst Villiers, who had also produced the supercharger. W. O. Bentley, as chief engineer of the company he had founded, refused to allow the engine to be modified to incorporate the supercharger. As a result, the supercharger was placed at the end of the crankshaft, in front of the radiator. This gave the Blower Bentley an easily recognisable appearance and also increased the car's understeer due to the additional weight at the front. A guard protected the two carburetters located at the compressor intake. Similar protection was used, both in the 4\u00bd Litre and the Blower, for the fuel tank at the rear, because a flying stone punctured the 3 Litre of Frank Clement and John Duff during the first 24 Hours of Le Mans, which contributed to their defeat."]}, {"page": "Martinsyde Buzzard", "response": [": One aircraft built for the engine designer Amherst Villiers."]}, {"page": "Jean Chassagne", "response": ["W. O. Bentley was against supercharging his 4.5 \u2013 litre cars and it was left to Henry Tim Birkin sponsored by the Hon. Dorothy Paget to initiate the construction of a team of Blower Bentleys designed by Amherst Villiers and built at the Birkin\u2019s Works, Welwyn Garden City. At the 1930 Brooklands Double Twelve Chassagne shared Birkin\u2019s favourite Blower Bentley but the Mechan\u2019s frame broke and the car retired at 4.30 pm of the first day's racing. Again sharing a car with Birkin at the Le Mans Grand Prix d\u2019Endurance, the car put up the fastest lap at 89.69\u00a0mph overtaking Caracciola at nearly 120\u00a0mph but retired on lap 138 with a broken valve. The Bentley Works Team was retired but the Birkin Blowers were entered in the 1930 Phoenix Park Irish Grand Prix where they had a close race with the Mercedes 7 litre supercharged; Chasssagne car suffered from lubrication problem.
