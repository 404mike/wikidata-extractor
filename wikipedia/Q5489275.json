Coming from a family with many church choristers, he taught himself to play the piano, and soon became \u201caccompanist in chief\u201d. He joined the choir of St Martin's Church, Lincoln at age 6, and also taught himself to play the organ. Rose was later to be appointed organist and choirmaster at Ruskington before going up to university.\nRose attended St Faith\u2019s Primary School and Christ\u2019s Hospital Continuation School before gaining a scholarship at age 9 to Lincoln City School. He was much influenced by the senor chemistry master there. At age 16 he was interviewed by Professor Frederic Kipping, FRS at Nottingham, and offered a place in two years\u2019 time. He gained a first class degree, largely thanks to the quality of Kipping\u2019s teaching.\nRose stayed on at Nottingham for his PhD, during which time he attracted the attention of the Dyestuffs Division of ICI. They wanted new types of intermediate for direct azo dyes, a problem which Rose solved in 1932 with a method suitable for large scale manufacture. This success led to his being recruited that year by ICI. Four years later the management decided that they would enter the pharmaceuticals field, and Rose was to be part of the group. \u201cFrom that time until his death 52 years later Rose was entirely consumed by his love for the biological activity of chemicals.\u201dHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1957 when his candidacy citation read: \n\nDistinguished for his researches in organic chemistry with particular reference to chemotherapy. As leader of theMedicinal Chemicals Section of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (Dyestuffs Division) he, with his colleague, the lateDr. F.H.S. Curd, was responsible for the brilliant series of researches culminating in the discovery of the antimalarialdrug paludrine, His contributions throughout have been marked by skill in experimentation and by the originality of hisconcepts of the relation between chemical structure and pharmacological action, concepts which have paved the wayfor his numerous successes in the field of chemotherapy, e.g. synthesis of paludrine, and of the trypanocide antrycide.  \n\nHe won their Leverhulme Prize in 1975, and was made CBE in 1978. He was made an honorary DSc of Loughborough University in 1982.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lincoln College, Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Frank Rose CBE FRS, chemist, Research Manager from 1954 to 1971 of the Pharmaceutical Division of ICI where he developed sulphamerazine, and developed the anti-malaria drug Paludrine during the war 1920\u20131927"]}, {"page": "Francis Leslie Rose", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Rose (chemist)"]}, {"page": "Frank Rose", "response": ["Frank Rose may refer to:", "* Frank Rose (politician) (1857\u20131928), British MP for Aberdeen North", "* Frank Rose (chemist) (1909\u20131988), British chemist", "* Frank Rose (academic) (1920\u20131991), American president of the University of Alabama"]}, {"page": "Scheele Award", "response": ["*1961 Frank Rose"]}]}}
