Longley (B.Sc., Ph.D., D.Sc., FAcSS) is a British geographer. He is Professor of Geographic Information Science (GISci) at University College London (UCL), UK, where he also directs the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre. Prior to joining UCL in July 2000, he was the Professor of Geography at the University of Bristol.\nHis research interests are developed around socioeconomic applications of GIScience, and have included projects based on topics such as: geo-temporal demographics and social media usage, fractal analysis of cities, geo-genealogy of family names, retail geography analytics and the effectiveness of public service delivery (specifically health, education and policing). His publications include 18 books and over 150 contributions to refereed journal articles, edited collections and book chapters. He is past Editor-in-Chief of the academic journal Computers, Environment and Urban Systems and a past co-editor of Environment and Planning B.He teaches Geographic Information Science and Systems and is a co-author of the best-selling book of that name. He has been involved in the postgraduate supervision of over 50 Ph.D. students. He is a regular contributor to internationally conferences and has held eleven externally funded visiting appointments, and has many extensive teaching commitments.\nIn 2013 he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society Victoria Medal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul longley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Longley"]}, {"page": "Michael Batty", "response": ["His research has focussed on the development of analytical methods and computer models for simulating the structure of cities and regions. Early work involved aggregate land use transport models which are summarised in his first book Urban Modelling. After this early work, he focused on more visual representations of cities and their models and some of these were represented in his second book Microcomputer Graphics. With Paul Longley, he published Fractal Cities. This work established the idea that cities might be regarded as the outcome of self-similar fractal processes generating structure from the bottom up. His work on complexity theory in urban analysis and planning is the focus of his book Cities and Complexity, a summary of which is available on his ComplexCity web site. His book The New Science of Cities. ties many of the ideas together, developing the notion that it is flows rather than locations that are key to an understanding not only of cities but also the processes for their design and planning. His most recent book Inventing Future Cities was published by MIT Press in 2018 and focuses on the idea that we can invent the future with respect to cities but can never predict them."]}, {"page": "Longley, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Longley"]}]}}
