With the 53rd Regiment and the Brunswick Prinz Friedrich Regiment, he successfully defended Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence from American attacks in 1777, declaring \"The Garrison invested to my charge, I shall defend to the last.\" Weeks after General Burgoyne's surrender, however, BG Powell abandoned Fort Ticonderoga and returned to Canada. He also held commands at Montreal, Fort Niagara, and Quebec during the course of the war.In 1780, while stationed at Quebec, Powell bought an estate which would later be named Spencer Wood, the Quebec Government House.

However, its splendour today is owed in part to Henry Atkinson, who bought this land in 1833. With his gardener, he created an English-style garden with elms, oaks and trails. Without an owner in 1854, the estate was divided into several sections and the most imposing lot was bought by the government of the Province of Canada to house the governor general."]}, {"page": "Henry Powell", "response": ["*Henry Watson Powell (1733\u20131814), British officer"]}, {"page": "East Yorkshire Regiment", "response": ["*1794\u20131814: Gen.
