Farage announced his decision to resign in December 2018, calling Batten \"obsessed\" with Islam and saying that \"UKIP wasn't founded to be a party based on fighting a religious crusade\". Former Deputy Chair Suzanne Evans had left earlier that week after Batten survived a vote of confidence from the party NEC. The former leader of the party in the Welsh Assembly, Caroline Jones, and the MEP William Dartmouth had also cited the party's trajectory to the right as reasons for leaving the party.-  Another former leader, Paul Nuttall, also left for the same reason. By December 2018, a majority of the party's MEPs had left. Others leaving included Peter Whittle, the party's top vote-winner on the London Assembly."]}, {"page": "Lancaster University", "response": ["* Suzanne Evans, Religious Studies (1987, Cartmel) \u2013 Former Deputy Chairman of the UK Independence Party"]}, {"page": "Nigel Farage", "response": ["Farage resigned as leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party on 4 July 2016, saying that: \"It's right that I should now stand aside as leader.

Writing in The Spectator, after his resignation, the journalist Rod Liddle described Farage as: \"The most important British politician of the last decade and the most successful. His resignation leaves a hole in our political system. With enormous intelligence and chutzpah and a refreshingly unorthodox approach, he built UKIP up from nothing to become established as our third largest party and succeeded in his overriding ambition \u2013 to see the UK vote to leave the European Union.\""]}, {"page": "List of Have I Got News for You episodes", "response": ["|Suzanne Evans", "|Suzanne Evans"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Suzanne Evans (born 1965), English UKIP politician"]}, {"page": "Shrewsbury Sixth Form College", "response": ["* Suzanne Evans - British journalist and politician"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Yvette Cooper, Tim Farron, Suzanne Evans, Conor Burns, Simon Jenkins", "|Ed Davey, Chris Bryant, Sarah Wollaston, Suzanne Evans, Armando Iannucci", "|Amber Rudd, Andy Burnham, Suzanne Evans, Fraser Nelson, Giles Fraser25 June 2015: Giles Fraser was a last minute replacement for Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis who was scheduled to be on the panel.", "|Kenneth Clarke, Chris Bryant, Yanis Varoufakis, Suzanne Evans, Julia Hartley-Brewer", "|David Davis, Keir Starmer, Nick Clegg, Suzanne Evans, Melanie Phillips, Alex Salmond", "|David Davis, Barry Gardiner, Nick Clegg, Suzanne Evans, Angus Robertson"]}, {"page": "Paul Nuttall", "response": ["During his leadership bid in 2016, Nuttall pitched himself as the unity candidate and made Suzanne Evans co-deputy chairwoman of the party and Patrick O'Flynn his principal political adviser, both of whom have been seen as political foes of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage.
