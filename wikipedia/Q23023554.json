Whilst there he published some educational editions of the classics and other works on history and English literature. His classical training naturally turned his attention to Roman history and archaeology, which led him to spend much time in British and continental museums, and on which he gave BBC talks.\nHe began practical archaeological excavations in 1922, and went on to unearth four Roman villas, a Romano-Celtic Temple on Farley Heath, Surrey and two Roman posting stations, made countless sections of Roman roads and found and dug a score of medieval glasshouse sites. Added to this he investigated six Early Iron Age camps in Sussex, Surrey and Kent. He also wrote four titles in the Penguin Guides series, which provided post-war touring guides to the English counties.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stane Street (Chichester)", "response": ["Although knowledge of Stane Street appears to have continued from Anglo-Saxon times into the early modern period and beyond (as evidenced by a reference in Britannia by William Camden, first published in 1586), no systematic studies of the route were carried out until the early 20th century. The writer Hilaire Belloc published The Stane Street: A monograph in 1913, in which he attempted to reconstruct the entirety of the route. Since Belloc was not a trained surveyor, his work on the route to the north of Dorking contained significant inaccuracies, which W. A. Grant (a former captain in the Royal Engineers) attempted to address in his critical review, published in 1922. Excavations carried out by the amateur archaeologist S. E. Winbolt, detailed in his book With a spade on Stane Street, first published in 1936, made a significant contribution to our current understanding and formed the basis of the relevant chapter in Ivan Margary's book Roman Ways in the Weald, published in 1948. Margary number 15 is assigned to the road.", "A  length of Stane Street at Redlands Wood near South Holmwood was restored by the archaeologist S. E. Winbolt in 1935. The section was turfed over to protect it for future generations."]}, {"page": "Frant", "response": ["Frant is an ancient village and some of its Victorian buildings (the old Frant Church of England Primary School and other High Street buildings) still stand. Although it was not mentioned in the Domesday Book, a settlement certainly predates the Norman Conquest; indeed, excavations in 1929 by S. E. Winbolt uncovered pottery fragments and ironworkings that indicated the presence of a settlement dating back to 100 BC. There is also evidence that a pre-Norman road, with military posts, ran from Frant to Crowborough."]}, {"page": "Golden line", "response": ["The term \"golden line\" did not exist in Classical antiquity.

E. Winbolt did some minor work. Between 1956 and 1962 Sheppard Frere re-excavated parts of the villa in the first attempt to determine its chronology. Since then Thomas Tupper, the direct descendant of the discoverer, whose family still owns the site, has undertaken further excavations: with Margaret Rule in the 1970s, and David Rudling in the 1980s."]}, {"page": "Rupert Bruce-Mitford", "response": ["Bruce-Mitford was successful, and happy, at Christ's Hospital. He was also introduced to archaeology; in 1930 he participated in a dig with S. E. Winbolt at the Jacobean ironworks in Dedisham, Sussex. Winbolt wrote in the school magazine that \"unhappily the 'dig' produced no useful results\", but added that \"possibly, however, the C.H. diggers learnt something\", and named Bruce-Mitford \"among willing helpers, mentioned honoris causa\". Meanwhile, Bruce-Mitford was active in school events, including playing rugby and cricket, acting in (and directing the orchestra for) John Galsworthy's The Little Man, debating at the Horsham Workers\u2019 Educational Association, and writing his first article, on a ten-day signals camp held over the 1931 summer holiday."]}, {"page": "Holmbury Hill", "response": ["Excavation of the hillfort in 1929 by classicist and amateur archeologist S. E. Winbolt indicated that it dated to the 1st Century AD and may have been constructed by Belgic tribes of Celts who were settling this part of Britain in the period prior to the Roman invasion of Britain. Later research, however, suggests that the fort was occupied earlier from 100 to 70 BC. The fort was defended by double ramparts to the west and north with escarpments on the eastern and southern slopes. The outer ditches were originally about three metres deep and six metres wide. The inner ditches were considerably larger, some four metres deep and nine metres wide.  These earthworks may have had a symbolic function in addition to a purely military one.  The hard band of chert on which the hill fort sits gives it a prominence over the weald that may have served as an assertion of control and security over the trade routes through the area.  There is no evidence to suggest long-term occupation of the fort but it would have offered a safe and obvious place to meet, trade and host communal activity."]}, {"page": "Hascombe Hill", "response": ["The site was excavated in 1931 by S. E. Winbolt, who dated the occupation of the site to the 1st century BC. The hillfort encloses a thickly wooded area of approximately . The sides of the fort, which are naturally very steep, were scarped at the top to make them almost unassailable. Encircling the crest of the hill is a defensive ditch  deep. The defences are reinforced on the northeast side (where the hillfort joins the rest of the hill) with a strong line of ramparts and ditches broken by a single entrance passage some  long."]}, {"page": "Folkestone Roman Villa", "response": ["The villa was rebuilt sometime in the second century, and when S. E. Winbolt excavated room no. 41 in 1924, he found over 2 inches of burnt material beneath the flooring, suggesting that the villa may have been gutted by fire. This second villa was more luxurious, and was complete with mosaics, painted walls, a bath house, and underfloor heating. The villa was rebuilt in roughly the same plan as before, but with enlarged rooms and corridors, an enlarged bath suite, and the addition of more rooms. Instead of tufa blocks, it was rebuilt with quarried and faced greensand stone, and on footings of rounded sea-stones laid on the gault clay. Tufa blocks were taken from the old building, and in some cases used to build portions of Block B. In all, over 60 rooms have been discovered in three separate blocks.", "The Roman Villa Site was known to inhabitants for many years before it was formally excavated. In the 18th century, the land was notoriously difficult to farm because of \"old stones\" which damaged farming equipment. In 1919, the curator of the Folkestone Museum, Mr. Browne Anderson, dug a preliminary trench at the site, but it wasn't until 1924 that the site was fully excavated by S. E. Winbolt. The site was open to the public, and was a popular tourist and national heritage attraction, until the onset of World War II. During the war, the site formed part of a series of gun emplacements along the cliffs, and was closed to the public (When archeologists excavated in 2010, they observed tank tracks across the Roman walls). The site reopened to the public in 1945, but continued to deteriorate. With funds for restoration or protection lacking due to post-war austerity measures, the decision was reluctantly made by the then Corporation of Folkestone to recover the site with clinker from the nearby municipal incineration unit."]}, {"page": "S.
