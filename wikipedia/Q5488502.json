This was partly due to the expense of replacing the sea-washed turf, which had proved troublesome and had been described as \"treacherous\" in the two years since it had been installed. The pitch at the ground would prove problematic for several seasons and the club eventually enlisted the help of seed specialists Suttons to improve the quality of the surface. Victory in the 1927 FA Cup Final raised enough funds for a roof to be erected over the terrace at the Grangetown end of the ground. Built by local company Connies & Meaden Limited, it was officially opened on 1 September 1928 before a league match against Burnley by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Arthur John Howell. It could hold 18,000 spectators. The investment in the stadium proved detrimental to the team as manager Fred Stewart was left with little money to reinvest in an ageing squad. Replacements were sourced from amateur clubs, but the side was relegated to the Football League Third Division South by 1932. With the club's finances dwindling, the board was keen to add new revenue streams. Boxing matches were soon held at Ninian Park with the first professional event in August 1931 featuring former British light-heavyweight champion Frank Moody. The 1932 Cardiff Sports Carnival was also based at the ground, which included the final of the 12-mile road race finishing with three laps around the stands. The idea of installing a greyhound track at the stadium was also proposed the same year but was met with opposition from council and footballing authorities before being abandoned."]}, {"page": "Jack Delaney", "response": ["|align=left| Frank Moody"]}, {"page": "1900 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 27 August \u2013 Frank Moody, Welsh boxer (died 1963)"]}, {"page": "1963 in Wales", "response": ["*29 July \u2013 Frank Moody, British boxing champion, 62"]}, {"page": "Tiger Flowers", "response": ["|align=left| Frank Moody", "|align=left| Frank Moody"]}, {"page": "1927 in Wales", "response": ["** Frank Moody wins the British lightweight and middleweight titles."]}, {"page": "Ted \"Kid\" Lewis", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Frank Moody", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Frank Moody"]}, {"page": "1900 in Wales", "response": ["* 27 August \u2013 Frank Moody, British boxing champion (died 1963)"]}, {"page": "Moody (surname)", "response": ["*Frank Moody (1900\u20131963), Welsh boxer"]}, {"page": "Len Harvey", "response": ["|align=left| Frank Moody"]}, {"page": "List of British light-heavyweight boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Frank Moody"]}, {"page": "List of British middleweight boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Frank Moody", "|align=left | Frank Moody"]}, {"page": "Kid Norfolk", "response": ["|align=left| Frank Moody", "|align=left| Frank Moody"]}, {"page": "Jerry Shea", "response": ["As well as a rugby player Shea was also a professional boxer, fighting in the welter and middleweight categories.

Daniels' title was not at stake, as the weight stipulated was 1 lbs above the light-heavyweight limit. The big difference in weight notwithstanding, Johnson gave Daniels a lesson in boxing and ringcraft, and did everything to him except knock him out. He may have knocked Daniels out if he had let himself out to the full at any time during the last five rounds. As it was, Johnson defeated Daniels by a convincing margin of points. It was soon seen that Daniels was bent on mischief, but all he did was to make people laugh when he missed by \"miles\" with huge left and ring swings. After this, Johnson's punching powder improved wonderfully, and he punished Daniels with terrific right upper-cuts and swing punches to the bdy and short arm blows to Daniels' jaw. At the result of the fight, there was joy in Bill Johnson's camp, as the victory of son's was of great importance in England and therefore meant that he would be in greater demand and may eventually go to America.
