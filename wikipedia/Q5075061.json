He was appointed as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve in 1893. He is perhaps best remembered as the captain of the Britannic from 1915 to November 1916, when the ship was sunk off Greece by a German-laid mine. After the war he served as Royal Naval Reserve aide-de-camp to King George V.  Bartlett was known as \"Iceberg Charlie\" to his crew due to his alleged ability to detect icebergs miles away. He retired in 1931 and died in a nursing home in Waterloo near Liverpool on 15 February 1945 at age 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HMHS Britannic", "response": ["Repainted white with large red crosses and a horizontal green stripe, she was renamed HMHS (His Majesty's Hospital Ship) Britannic and placed under the command of Captain Charles Alfred Bartlett..

Carlisle was the brother-in-law of the shipyard's chairman Lord Pirrie, and together with Pirrie was initially responsible for the design of the Olympic-class liners (including Titanic). Carlisle had retired in 1910, and like Pirrie had not travelled on the maiden voyage of Titanic. The lead designer on board had been Thomas Andrews, Pirrie's nephew, who went down with the ship. The only passengers to testify, other than Ismay, were Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon and his wife Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon."]}, {"page": "1914 Birthday Honours", "response": ["** Charles Alfred Bartlett, RD."]}, {"page": "1916 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Captain Charles Alfred Bartlett, R.N.R., R.D.  #"]}]}}
