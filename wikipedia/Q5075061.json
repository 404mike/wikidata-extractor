He was appointed as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve in 1893. He is perhaps best remembered as the captain of the Britannic from 1915 to November 1916, when the ship was sunk off Greece by a German-laid mine. After the war he served as Royal Naval Reserve aide-de-camp to King George V.  Bartlett was known as \"Iceberg Charlie\" to his crew due to his alleged ability to detect icebergs miles away. He retired in 1931 and died in a nursing home in Waterloo near Liverpool on 15 February 1945 at age 76.", "link_mentions": {}}}
