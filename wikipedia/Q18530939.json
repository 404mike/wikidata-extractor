His brother was Charles John Cornish. He was educated at home before attending St Paul's School, London, when he was 17. He studied chemistry at the Victoria University of Manchester, graduating with a first class BSc (1888). He then gained a MSc (1892) and a DSc (1901).He visited the building of the Panama Canal in 1907, documented in his The Panama Canal and its Makers (1909). He visited the site again in 1910. He was interested in the strategy and political geography of the British Empire, hoping that British emigration to the Empire would promote the future interests of the \"white races\".In 1928-29, he served as the President of the Geographical Association in the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "South Downs National Park", "response": ["The idea of a South Downs National Park originated in the 1920s,In fact, the idea may go back further, according to Peter Brandon in his book, The Shaping of the Sussex Landscape (Snake River Press, 2009). He notes that \"John Halsham\" (G. Forrester Scott) advocated what we would now call a national park for part of the Weald and Downs in 1898. when public concern was mounting about increasing threats to the beautiful downland environment, particularly the impact of indiscriminate speculative housing development on the eastern Sussex Downs (Peacehaven was an example of this). In 1929, the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, led by campaigners including the geographer Vaughan Cornish, submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister urging the case for national parks, including a national park on part of the South Downs. When however, towards the end of World War II, John Dower was asked to report on how a system of national parks in England and Wales might be established, his 1945 report, National Parks in England and Wales, did not identify the South Downs for national park status, but rather included it in a list of \"other amenity areas\". Sir Arthur Hobhouse's 1947 Report of the National Parks Committee took a different view, and he included the South Downs in his list of twelve areas recommended for designation as a national park, defined by John Dower as an \"extensive area of beautiful and relatively wild country in which, for the nation's benefit...the characteristic landscape beauty is strictly preserved\"."]}, {"page": "Harold Jeffreys", "response": ["* 1934: Ocean Waves and Kindred Geophysical Phenomena, with Vaughan Cornish, Cambridge University Press"]}, {"page": "Albert Kitson", "response": ["*Percy Cox, K.

In the 1930s geographer Vaughan Cornish advocated a national park for the South Downs between the rivers Arun and Adur, believing that the eastern downs would be looked after by Brighton and Eastbourne Councils and the western downs were too wooded to be representative of the South Downs.
