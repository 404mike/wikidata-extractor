The torsion mangonel myth began in the 18th century when Francis Grose claimed that the onager was the dominant medieval artillery until the arrival of gunpowder. In the mid-19th century, Guillaume Henri Dufour adjusted this framework by arguing that onagers went out of use in medieval times, but were directly replaced by the counterweight trebuchet. Dufour and Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte argued that torsion machines were abandoned because the requisite supplies needed to build the sinew skein and metal support pieces were too difficult to obtain in comparison to the materials needed for tension and counterweight machines.Dufour, 97,99; Bonaparte, 26. In the early 20th century, Ralph Frankland-Payne-Gallwey concurred that torsion catapults were not used in medieval times, but only owing to their greater complexity, and believed that they were superior to \"such a clumsy engine as the medieval trebuchet.\" Others such as General K\u00f6hler disagreed and argued that torsion machines were used throughout the Middle Ages.K\u00f6hler, 139-211 The torsion mangonel myth is particularly appealing for many historians due to its potential as an argument for the continuity of classical technologies and scientific knowledge into the Early Middle Ages, which they use to refute the concept of medieval decline."]}, {"page": "Dozen", "response": ["According to the 1811 Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, by Francis Grose, \"a Baker's Dozen is Thirteen; that number of rolls being allowed to the purchaser of a dozen\"..
