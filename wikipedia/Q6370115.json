She played for Doncaster Belles for 20 years, starting at the age of 15, and began playing for England as a teenager, making 83 appearances and scoring a record 40 goals until she retired from international football in 2003. Walker's uncompromising style of play earned her the sobriquet \"Wacker\".Walker is particularly remembered for her performances in the 1995 World Cup in Sweden. She finished her career with two seasons at Leeds United, and in her last game, against Arsenal in the 2006 FA Cup Final, she left the pitch to a standing ovation.\nIn 2007, she was part of the BBC team covering the FIFA Women's World Cup in China. Later that year she was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": []}}
