At Benny Jacob's gym, Sangoe would often spar with the likes of Erskine, Phil Edwards and on occasional visits, Brian Curvis and dealt with them comfortably. When American heavyweight fighter Mike DeJohn came to Wales in 1960 to face Dick Richardson, he stayed in Cardiff and sparred with Sangoe. Fellow boxers Lennie Williams and Harry Carroll stated that DeJohn had \"no idea how to cope with Sangoe\"."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Phil Edwards"]}]}}
