Originally these also included prokaryotes, but with time these would be removed to a fourth kingdom Monera. In the popular five-kingdom scheme proposed by Robert Whittaker in 1969, Protista was defined as eukaryotic \"organisms which are unicellular or unicellular-colonial and which form no tissues\", and the fifth kingdom Fungi was established. In the five-kingdom system of Lynn Margulis, the term protist is reserved for microscopic organisms, while the more inclusive kingdom Protoctista (or protoctists) included certain large multicellular eukaryotes, such as kelp, red algae and slime molds. Others use the term protist interchangeably with Margulis's protoctist, to encompass both single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including those that form specialized tissues but do not fit into any of the other traditional kingdoms.", "Among the pioneers in the study of the protists, which were almost ignored by Linnaeus except for some genera (e.g., Vorticella, Chaos, Volvox, Corallina, Conferva, Ulva, Chara, Fucus)Ratcliff, Marc J.

Green Taylor and Francis, London 2000, p. 3. In 1818, the German naturalist Georg August Goldfuss introduced the word Protozoa to refer to organisms such as ciliates and corals. From p. 1008: \"Erste Klasse. Urthiere. Protozoa.\" (First class.  Primordial animals. Protozoa.) [Note: each column of each page of this journal is numbered; there are two columns per page.] After the cell theory of Schwann and Schleiden (1838\u201339), this group was modified in 1848 by Carl von Siebold to include only animal-like unicellular organisms, such as foraminifera and amoebae.  From p. 3: \"Erste Hauptgruppe. Protozoa. Thiere, in welchen die verschiedenen Systeme der Organe nicht scharf ausgeschieden sind, und deren unregelm\u00e4ssige Form und einfache Organisation sich auf eine Zelle reduziren lassen.\" (First principal group. Protozoa. Animals, in which the different systems of organs are not sharply separated, and whose irregular form and simple organization can be reduced to one cell.) The formal taxonomic category Protoctista was first proposed in the early 1860s by John Hogg, who argued that the protists should include what he saw as primitive unicellular forms of both plants and animals. He defined the Protoctista as a \"fourth kingdom of nature\", in addition to the then-traditional kingdoms of plants, animals and minerals.  From p. 223:  \"... I here suggest a fourth or an additional kingdom, under the title of the Primigenal kingdom, ... This Primigenal kingdom would comprise all the lower creatures, or the primary organic beings, \u2013 'Protoctista,' \u2013 from \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, first, and \u03c7\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac, created beings; ...\" The kingdom of minerals was later removed from taxonomy in 1866 by Ernst Haeckel, leaving plants, animals, and the protists (Protista), defined as a \"kingdom of primitive forms\".

Character of the kingdom of Protists.)"]}, {"page": "Protozoa", "response": ["Criticism of this system began in the latter half of the 19th century, with the realization that many organisms met the criteria for inclusion among both plants and animals. For example, the algae Euglena and Dinobryon have chloroplasts for photosynthesis, like plants, but can also feed on organic matter and are motile, like animals. In 1860, John Hogg argued against the use of \"protozoa\", on the grounds that \"naturalists are divided in opinion \u2014 and probably some will ever continue so\u2014whether many of these organisms or living beings, are animals or plants.\" As an alternative, he proposed a new kingdom called Primigenum, consisting of both the protozoa and unicellular algae, which he combined under the name \"Protoctista\".
