He was also a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Cambridge Town Club, known sometimes as \"Cambridgeshire\". He was born in London and died at Whissendine in Rutland.\nCaptain of cricket at Shrewsbury School in 1854, Horne appeared for Cambridge University between 1855 and 1858 in eight matches that have subsequently been designated as first-class, playing as an all-rounder: a lower order batsman and a bowler. Three of his matches were the University matches against Oxford University in 1855, 1857 and 1858; his record in these games was not distinguished, but in other matches, he twice took six wickets in an innings. He also played once in a first-class match for Cambridgeshire in 1858 during that team's fleeting status as one of the first-class counties.", "link_mentions": {}}}
