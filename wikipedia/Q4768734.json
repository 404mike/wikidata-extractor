Sherwood claimed self-defence, telling the court that he feared for his life, believing\u2014based on the briefing for the operation\u2014that Ashley's outstretched arm was holding a firearm and was about to shoot. In directing the jury, the judge stated that no evidence had been presented that Sherwood fired other than in self-defence, and in her summing up suggested that \"those who should be held accountable were not present\" in her court. The superintendent and two inspectors suspended after the first inquiry were then prosecuted for misconduct in public office in relation to their planning and execution of the raid. The prosecution alleged that the three had deliberately failed to give an accurate representation of the intelligence but all three were found not guilty at Wolverhampton Crown Court when the Crown Prosecution Service declined to offer any evidence. Nigel Sweeney, prosecuting, told the court that the depth of \"corporate failing\" within Sussex Police made it impossible to place criminal liability with individual officers.Punch, p. 14. Following the verdict Ashley's family announced their intention to sue Sussex Police for negligence.
