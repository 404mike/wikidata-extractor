However, he was then elected for the seat at the 1874 election, but was beaten again in 1880. He continued to fight for the seat, standing in 1885 and an 1886 by-election, before being elected to the seat again in 1892. He held the seat until 1900 when he did not seek re-election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Morley", "response": ["Morley was a prominent Gladstonian Liberal. In Newcastle, his constituency association chairman was the effective Robert Spence Watson, a leader of the National Liberal Federation and its chairman from 1890 to 1902. Newcastle, however, was a dual member constituency and Morley's parliamentary colleague, Joseph Cowen, was a radical in perpetual conflict with the Liberal Party, who owned the Newcastle Chronicle. Cowen attacked Morley from the left, and sponsored working men candidates on his retirement from the seat, showing favour to the local Tory candidate, Charles Hamond. Morley, with Watson's machine, withstood the Cowen challenge until the 1895 general election, when the tactics caused the ejection of Morley and the loss of Newcastle to the Tories."]}, {"page": "Charles Frederick Hamond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Hamond"]}, {"page": "Charles Frederic Hamond", "response": ["#REDIRECTCharles Hamond"]}]}}
