The first polyphonic MIDI version of the Nokia tune, created by composer Ian Livingstone (often mistaken as being Thomas Dolby's work), was introduced in 2001 with the release of two South Korea-exclusive devices, the Nokia 8877 and the Nokia 8887. The Nokia 3510, released in 2002, was the first globally released phone to include this version, using Beatnik's miniBAE technology. The Nokia 9500 Communicator in 2004 introduced a realtone recorded piano version. A guitar-based version was introduced with the Nokia N78 in 2008, reflecting the popularity of nu-folk at the time.

After Beatnik met with Nokia, the Beatnik Audio Engine was reworked into miniBAE, an optimized version designed for portable devices. In addition to Nokia, the engine was licensed to other manufacturers such as Danger and Sony Ericsson. Most notably, the engine was used on most Nokia phones of the time to play the polyphonic version of the Nokia tune arranged by Ian Livingstone (often falsely attributed as being Dolby's own work), who created several polyphonic arrangements of Nokia's monophonic ringtones. The first phone to ship with the engine was the Nokia 3510, released in 2002. "]}]}}
