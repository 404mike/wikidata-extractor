Pyne and John Syer. In 1844, when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded, the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it. During World War II the Academy became the temporary home of various organisations including the Bristol Aeroplane Company and the U.S. Army. It was not until 1950 that the building was returned to its original function after the intervention of the then Prime Minister, Clement Attlee. Among the paintings in the permanent collection are works by artists from the Newlyn, St Ives and Bloomsbury Schools. Paintings by George Swaish, Matthew Hale, Anne Redpath, Mary Fedden, Carel Weight, Bernard Dunstan and Elizabeth Blackadder are also valued additions to the collection. The building is a grade II* listed building constructed in 1857. The interiors are by Charles Underwood and fa\u00e7ade by JR Hirst, altered in 1912 by SS Reay and H Dare Bryan.
