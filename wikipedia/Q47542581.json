Though designated as a alternate player, due to rule changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic she was eligible to compete in all matches (unlike previous tournaments, in which alternates could only compete after permanently replacing an injured player). Though Great Britain earned the bronze medal, she did not make an appearance and was therefore ineligible to receive a medal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Birmingham Hockey Club", "response": ["* Amy Costello"]}, {"page": "Scotland at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["*Amy Costello"]}]}}
