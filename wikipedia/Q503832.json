His experience and the care he showed for his team ensured he never lost a man, despite the harshness of the country he encountered.\nThe explorations of Stuart eventually resulted in the 1863 annexation of a huge area of country to the Government of South Australia. This area became known as the Northern Territory. In 1911 the Commonwealth of Australia assumed responsibility for that area. In 1871\u201372 the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was constructed along Stuart's route.
