During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions.

Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity.Moran (1985) p.38 The judges decided that \"every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong\", which was boiled down to \"did the defendant know what he was doing, and if so, that what he was doing was wrong?\".
