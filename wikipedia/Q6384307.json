He became homesick and joined Sheffield United.\nA prolific goalscorer, he had two spells (1975\u20131978 and 1981\u20131986) at Sheffield United for whom he scored 171 goals in 293 appearances. Whilst with the Blades, he was the highest scoring player in a division twice, scoring 36 goals (one for Hull City) in Division 4 in 1981\u201382 and 33 goals in Division 3 in 1983\u201384. The latter haul earned Edwards his second Adidas Golden Boot award.\nHis debut for United came in a FA Cup Third Round Tie against Leicester City on 3 January 1976 and his League debut came on 28 February 1976 in a Division 1 game against Queens Park Rangers. However, his first goal didn't arrive until the next season in Division 2 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 24 August 1976.\nIn between his time at Bramall Lane he played for Hull City who paid \u00a350,000 for Edwards in 1978. Ian Porterfield bought him back for \u00a3100,000 and played him for the first time against Scunthorpe United on 26 September 1981, the 1\u20130 home victory being the first of a 17-game unbeaten run. Edwards scored his first two goals under Porterfield in a 4\u20130 win over Crewe Alexandra three days later.\nHe formed an impressive partnership with Bob Hatton, feeding off the distribution of Colin Morris as United ended the season with 19 games without defeat to win the Fourth Division Championship, his 35 goals being a post-war record.\nHis final appearance for United came in a pre-season friendly at Bramall Lane against Spanish club Sevilla FC on 1 August 1986. He began the 1986\u201387 season at Leeds United after a transfer fee of \u00a3125,000 but only managed 9 goals in 51 appearances, although one of those was against Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1987. Despite his efforts, Leeds lost the game 3\u20132. They also missed out on promotion to the First Division weeks later, losing the relegation/promotion playoff final to Charlton Athletic in a replay.\nAberdeen secured his services later in 1987 and he returned to Hull City in 1988. He later played for Stockport County, Huddersfield Town and finished his career at Plymouth Argyle in 1990. He is one of the select band of players to have scored over 250 league goals in English football, although almost all of his career was spent outside the top flight.\nIn recent years, Keith has worked for BBC Radio Sheffield commentating on matches involving one of his former clubs, Sheffield United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheffield United F.C.", "response": ["A 'Player of the Year' award has been presented since 1967 to recognise the player who has made the greatest contribution to the club over the course of the season. Initially organised by the Official Supporters Club the award was voted for by their members although it was presented as an official club award.  In recent years the award has been presented at a gala 'End of Season' award ceremony and dinner, usually held at the end of April, and voting has been widened to include a broader section of the club's fanbase.  The first winner of the award was long serving goalkeeper Alan Hodgkinson. The player with the most award wins is striker Alan Woodward on four occasions between 1970 and 1978.  The longest gap between wins by a player is seven years; Keith Edwards had two spells with the club and won the award during both, in 1977 and 1984. Harry Maguire and Phil Jagielka have won the award on three consecutive occasions. The award was shared between two players for the first time in 2017, with Billy Sharp and John Fleck receiving the award."]}, {"page": "Hull City A.F.C.", "response": ["The club also has a traditional rivalry with Sheffield United. In 1984, Sheffield United won promotion at Hull City's expense with the teams level on points and goal difference and separated only by goals scored, with 33 of United's goals scored by former Hull City striker Keith Edwards. City's final game of the season against Burnley had been rescheduled due to bad weather and took place after their promotion rivals had finished their campaign; Hull went into the game knowing that a three-goal victory would mean promotion, but in front of a crowd which included a number of United fans could manage only a 2\u20130 win, ensuring that United went up instead."]}, {"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["During the 1986 close season, Bremner spent \u00a3125,000 on 29-year-old Sheffield United striker Keith Edwards, and a further \u00a380,000 to bring in 31-year-old Carlisle United defender Jack Ashurst and Newcastle United defender Peter Haddock. Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (\u00a315,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (\u00a335,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986\u201387 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for \u00a3840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for \u00a3110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for \u00a372,000 and \u00a3200,000 respectively. A 2\u20131 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3\u20132 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1\u20130 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's. John Sheridan put Leeds ahead in extra-time of the replay, but two late goals from Peter Shirtliff changed the game and denied Leeds promotion."]}]}}
