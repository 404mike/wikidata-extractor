Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. One of the earliest known written examples comes from November 3, 1863, diary entry of William Howard Russell, in which he referred to gossip about \"the First Lady in the Land\", referring to Mary Todd Lincoln. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist Mary C. Ames referred to Lucy Webb Hayes as \"the First Lady of the Land\" while reporting on the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled The First Lady in the Land, popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations."]}, {"page": "The Times", "response": ["The Times was one of the first newspapers to send war correspondents to cover particular conflicts.

The joint commanders, Raglan and St Arnaud, agreed. On 25 September, the whole army began to march southeast and encircled the city from the south after it had established port facilities at Balaclava for the British and at Kamiesch () for the French. The Russians retreated into the city.The famous dispatches of a British war correspondent appear in William Howard Russell, The Great War with Russia: The Invasion of the Crimea; a Personal Retrospect of the Battles of the Alma, Balaclava and Inkerman, and of the Winter of 1854\u201355 (Cambridge University Press, 2012)", "A large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854. The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in Britain for the actions of two British units. At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders, who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi. Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell. Rather than \"form square\", the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line two men deep. Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minie rifles with which his troops were armed at the Battle of Alma, a month earlier, and he was confident that his men could beat back the Russians. His tactics succeeded.Greenwood, ch. 8 From up on the ridge to the west, Times correspondent William Howard Russell saw the Highlanders as a \"thin red streak topped with steel\", a phrase which soon became the \"Thin Red Line\".John Millin Selby, The thin red line of Balaclava (London: Hamilton, 1970)", "Documentation of the war was provided by William Howard Russell, who wrote for The Times newspaper, and by Roger Fenton's photographs.

Public opinion in Britain was outraged at the logistical and command failures of the war; the newspapers demanded drastic reforms, and parliamentary investigations demonstrated the multiple failures of the Army. The reform campaign was not well organised, and the traditional aristocratic leadership of the Army pulled itself together, and blocked all serious reforms. No one was punished. The outbreak of the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857 shifted attention to the heroic defence of British interest by the army, and further talk of reform went nowhere.Peter Burroughs, \"An Unreformed Army? 1815\u20131868,\" in David Chandler, ed., The Oxford History of the British Army (1996), pp. 183\u201384 The demand for professionalisation was achieved by Florence Nightingale, who gained worldwide attention for pioneering and publicising modern nursing while treating the wounded.

Additionally, the telegraph reduced the independence of British overseas possessions from their commanders in London due to such rapid communications.

On one occasion, attending wounded troops under fire, she dislocated her right thumb, an injury which never healed entirely.Seacole, Chapter XVI. In a dispatch written on 14 September 1855, William Howard Russell, special correspondent of The Times, wrote that she was a \"warm and successful physician, who doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success.

They all used herbal remedies and hygienic practices in the late eighteenth century, long before Nightingale took up the mantle.

In the work Seacole deals with the first 39\u00a0years of her life in one short chapter.Only four pages in the Penguin edition. She then expends six chapters on her few years in Panama, before using the following 12\u00a0chapters to detail her exploits in Crimea. She avoids mention of the names of her parents and precise date of birth.  In the first chapter, she talks about how her practice of medicine began on animals, such as cats and dogs. Most of the animals caught diseases from their owners, and she would cure them with homemade remedies.\u00a0 Within the book, Mrs. Seacole discusses how when she returned from the Crimean War she was poor, whereas others in her same position returned to England rich. Mrs. Seacole shares the respect she gained from the men in the Crimean War. The soldiers would refer to her as \"mother\" and would ensure her safety by personally guarding her on the battlefield. A short final \"Conclusion\" deals with her return to England, and lists supporters of her fund-raising effort, including Rokeby, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Wellington, the Duke of Newcastle, William Russell, and other prominent men in the military.

Lucan's subsequent explanation was that he saw no point in having a second brigade mown down, and he was best positioned where he was to render assistance to Light Brigade survivors returning from the charge. The French light cavalry, the Chasseurs d'Afrique, was more effective in that it cleared the Fedyukhin Heights of the two half batteries of guns, two infantry battalions, and Cossacks to ensure the Light Brigade would not be hit by fire from that flank, and it later provided cover for the remaining elements of the Light Brigade as they withdrew.

Raglan himself primarily blamed Lucan, who was infuriated by this and wrote a letter to Horse Guards disputing Raglan's claim. This was too much for Viscount Hardinge, the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, who had Lucan resign his command and return to Britain. With Hardinge unwilling to give him a court martial, Lucan wrote a pamphlet titled A Vindication of the Earl of Lucan from Lord Raglan's Reflections and a series of letters to The Times that revealed Raglan's order to have been highly ambiguous and \"not the kind of dispatch required by an officer on the battlefield\". At the same time, Nolan's method of delivery had been imperious, and he had insisted the urgency of the attack \u2013 something clear in Raglan's verbal order to him, but not in the written order. Public opinion became divided; people both attacked Nolan and rallied to his defence.

Lord Cardigan defended Nolan by saying the Captain \"did not have the least idea of the mistake which was about to be perpetrated.\" Within the Crimea, however, the majority \"roundly damned\" Nolan.
