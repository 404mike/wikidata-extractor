Sir Robert Henry Cunliffe, 4th Baronet (1785\u20131859), stuccoed the walls of the house, while Sir Robert Alfred Cunliffe (1839\u20131905), faced it with stone in such a way that the house seemed to be of three different styles - none matching the other. After the death of Sir Foster Cunliffe, 6th Baronet (1875\u20131916) in World War I, the estate was bought in 1917 by Sir Bernard Oppenheimer. The Denbighshire Hussars were billeted in the house and grounds at that time. Oppenheimer opened a diamond cutting training school and workshop in the grounds of Acton Park. The scheme was designed to ensure jobs for ex-servicemen. It was the 'Homes Fit For Heroes' ethos in action, but Sir Bernard's death in 1921 led to the workshop closing.Wrexham Council Website  (Retrieved January 2011)"]}, {"page": "Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin", "response": ["In 1932, Devlin married Madeleine Hilda Oppenheimer (1909\u20132012), daughter of the diamonds magnate Sir Bernard Oppenheimer, Bt.

Two large factories were built, both of which survive (but not in industrial use).  On the north side of Coombe Road, Bernard Oppenheimer's diamond cutting company National Diamond Factories (Bernard Oppenheimer) Ltd built a large works in 1917.  Employees included amputee former World War I soldiers.  In 1927, it was subdivided into premises for Schweppes and the local electrical engineering company Allen West Ltd, whose works further up Lewes Road had been damaged by a lightning strike.  C.V.A. Tools were the next occupants from 1945, but the factory closed in 1973 after a company takeover.  In 2000 it was renovated and turned into flats with Art Deco touches.  Immediately opposite, on the south side of Coombe Road, another diamond factory was built in 1918.  Later, until it closed in 1991, it became the European base of Dentsply, a false teeth manufacturer.  Since then it has been occupied by self storage space for the Big Yellow Group.  Smaller factories further up Coombe Road belonged to producers of artificial limbs and asbestos, among other products.  Allen West expanded further by building a large design and administration office in 1966 on land between Lewes Road and Dewe Road.  Contraction in the electrical engineering industry rendered it redundant almost immediately, though: it closed in 1968 and was sold to a property developer in 1972.  Five years later it was sold to Brighton Polytechnic (now the University of Brighton) and became Mithras House, one of the institution's main buildings."]}, {"page": "1921 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Bernard Oppenheimer.
