He scored on his debut in the First Division on 29 December 1894, deputising for regular outside right Jack Hallam in a home game against Liverpool which Small Heath won 3\u20130. Though he kept his place for the next game, his only other appearance for the first team was in the 1896 FA Cup first round match against Bury, in which he also scored.
