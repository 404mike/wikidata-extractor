His career encompassed time spent in both England and Scotland, as well as a spell in Wales.\nAs a player, he was used both as a defender and as a midfielder on the outside left. He started his career at Celtic in 1919, before moving to England two years later to play for Bradford City. In 1923 he moved on to Liverpool, where he would remain for the next four years. He then ended his playing career after spells with Bury and Yeovil Town.\nHe got his break in management with Yeovil Town in 1929, before he was installed as Clapton Orient manager in 1933. His reign was to only last one year, and he spent a spell in 1935 as Notts County manager, before he returned to Scotland later in the year to manage Heart of Midlothian. He left Hearts in 1937 and was appointed manager at Bangor City, though he lost his position before the end of the year. His final role was as Port Vale between 1944 and 1945, though he never actually took a charge of a game for the \"Valiants\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bangor City F.C.", "response": ["|  David Pratt"]}, {"page": "Heart of Midlothian F.C.", "response": ["* David Pratt (1935\u20131937)"]}, {"page": "Yeovil Town F.C.", "response": ["|1929\u201333|| David Pratt"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|David Pratt"]}, {"page": "Pratt", "response": ["* David Pratt (Canadian broadcaster) (late 20th/early 21st c.), Canadian sports radio personality and columnist", "* David Pratt (assassin) (1908\u20131961), attempted assassin of South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd", "* David Pratt (cricketer) (born 1938), English cricketer", "* David Pratt (footballer) (1896\u20131967), Scottish football player and manager", "* David Pratt (politician) (born 1955), Canadian politician"]}]}}
