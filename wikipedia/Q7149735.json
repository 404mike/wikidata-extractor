Prior to this he worked as a London-based freelance musician, mainly on the London jazz scene.\nAfter studying popular music in the early 1980s at Newcastle College, Carr continued to undertake a teaching degree at Middlesex University, followed by a PhD under the supervision of British composer Gavin Bryars.Since the early 1990s, Carr has been more involved in popular music education. He is currently head of The University of Glamorgan's Music Academy, in Cardiff, Wales.\nIn 2013, Carr edited the first academically focused volume of papers to detail Frank Zappa's legacy, Frank Zappa and the And, appearing as part of the Ashgate Popular and Folk Music Series. Drawing together an international list of writers from both the academic and music worlds, it is a pioneering collection that links and appraises a wide range of Zappa's work and influence including modernism, technology, satire, avant-garde, cinema and mortality.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Carr", "response": ["Paul Carr may refer to:", "*Paul Carr (actor) (1934\u20132006), American character actor", "*Paul Carr (American football) (1931\u20132006), American football player", "*Paul Carr (composer) (born 1961), English classical music composer", "*Paul Carr (Gaelic footballer), played for Donegal", "*Paul Carr (musician), English guitarist and member of the James Taylor Quartet", "*Paul Carr (rugby league) (born 1967), rugby league footballer of the 1990s for Scotland, South Sydney Rabbitohs, and Sheffield Eagles"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Middlesex University", "response": ["* Paul Carr, guitarist, former member of the James Taylor Quartet"]}]}}
