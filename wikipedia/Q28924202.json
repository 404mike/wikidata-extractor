He played primarily as a wicket-keeper, making 63 of his 66 first-class cricket appearances for the county, making 124 dismissals. Writing in Wisden in 1907 George Marsham described him as \"not a very brilliant wicket-keeper\" but \"a very plucky one\" and Pentecost was forced to stop playing earlier than would have been normal due to \"failing eyesight\".After being awarded his county cap in 1885, Pentecost was awarded a benefit match in 1892 and was a member of the ground staff at Lord's. He died at St John's Wood in London in February 1902 aged 44.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* John Pentecost (1887) : J. H.
