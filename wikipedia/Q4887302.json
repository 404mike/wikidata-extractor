He was educated at Charterhouse and Magdalene College, Cambridge. His first published theatre review was for the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser in 1957, a production of Look Back in Anger by a local amateur group.He worked for The Guardian as a reporter, and in 1969 was appointed drama critic of the New Statesman in London, a post that he held until 1986 when he was appointed Professor of English with special reference to Drama at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He spent the whole of the 1983-84 season in New York, writing a series of Sunday theatre columns for The New York Times. His diary of the period was first published by Times Books in 1986 as Fifth Row Center: A Critic's Year On and Off Broadway He was appointed chief theatre critic for The Times in London in 1990, in succession to Irving Wardle.\nAfter two decades at The Times, on 1 June 2010 Nightingale was replaced by journalist Libby Purves. This, its consequences and Nightingale's career as a critic were discussed by Mark Shenton in his 26 January 2010 theatre blog for The Stage.In 2010 he published a novel, What's So Flinking Bunny: The Spoonerisms and Misadventures of Tristram Throstlethwaite. In 2012 he published Great Moments in the Theatre, which examined some of what he considered the greatest moments in the history of the artform, from Aeschylus' Oresteia to Jez Butterworth's Jerusalem.\nHe has contributed to many newspapers and journals, including Encounter, London Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, Punch, The Sunday Times, The Observer. He also appeared on radio and TV.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Titus Andronicus", "response": ["Several reviews of the time made much of the manner in which each production approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape; \"At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry.\"  Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, said of the scene, \"audience members turned their heads away in real distress.\"Eleanor Collins, \"Titus Andronicus, directed by Lucy Bailey, The Globe, London, 31 May & 11 July 2006\", Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, 70:2 (Autumn, 2006), 49\u201351 Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia \"almost too ghastly to behold.\" Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage \"chills the blood.\" Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole; \"violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war.\" Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked \"is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?\"  Similarly, The Guardians Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote \"At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence.\" Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, for example, wrote \"Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic.\"Neil Allan and Scott Revers, \"Titus Andronicus, directed by Yukio Ninagawa for The Ninagawa Company, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, 21 June 2006\", Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, Special Issue: The Royal Shakespeare Company Complete Works (2007), 39\u201341 Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote \"Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror.\"Paul Taylor, \"Review of Yukio Ninagawa's Titus Andronicus\", The Independent (22 June 2006) Ninagawa himself said \"\"The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production.\" In her 2013 essay, \"Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agn\u00e8s Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a \"visual emblem\"; \"Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance ... Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to \"dissonance,\" the production presents Lavinia onstage as if she were a painting ... Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood ... are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it.\"Agn\u00e8s Lafont, \"Mythological reconfigurations on the contemporary stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\", Early Modern Literary Studies, Special Issue 21 (2013)"]}, {"page": "Hair (musical)", "response": ["The production received mostly enthusiastic reviews.

After accepting the part, he researched the character by reading case studies of adults who were abused when they were children.
