Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be changed for the better when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life.

In Blair's own account, A Journey (in which Mandelson features hardly at all, and Gordon Brown only at the end) it is of course very different. Almost everything is driven forward by him; the new Labour project was not imminent in Britain's political history\u00a0\u2013 it had to be shaped and moulded.\" A similar theme was echoed by David Runciman in The London Review of Books, where he reflected that Mandelson's memoirs \"provide a much more complete account of the Blair/Brown relationship\", including details of Operation Teddy Bear, an aborted plot from 2003 to curb Brown's increasing influence as Chancellor by dividing the Treasury to create a separate Office of Budget and Delivery that would be controlled directly by the Cabinet Office."]}, {"page": "Demeny voting", "response": ["Yet others have argued that lowering the voting age to 13 or 14 or lower would be more beneficial, as many children are able to express complex opinions at that age.No Right Turn: Against Demeny votingNo Right Turn: Lowering the voting age Further, lawyer Vivian Hamilton argues that in light of findings from research in developmental psychology and cognitive and social neuroscience, governments can \"no longer justify the electoral exclusion of mid-adolescents by claiming that they lack the relevant competencies.\"Democratic Inclusion, Cognitive Development, and the Age of Electoral Majority In the United Kingdom, Politics professor David Runciman argues for lowering the voting age to 6.Lower voting age to six to tackle bias against young, says academicVotes for children!
