Jowett played club rugby for Swansea, and county rugby for Glamorgan. His first and only cap was on 10 January 1903 at St Helens Ground in Swansea against England. He made his d\u00e9but in an experienced team, with only George Travers of Pill Harriers earning his first cap alongside Jowett. The match was a one sided affair, with Wales winning 21\u20135, thanks to a hat-trick of tries from Jehoida Hodges. Although playing his part in an excellent victory over England, Jowett was never selected again.\nThe next year Jowett was selected to represent Bedell Sivright's British Lions on their tour of Australia and New Zealand, and was selected for one test.\nJowett was a high scoring wing, and his 1902/03 season tally of 42 tries for Swansea is still a club record to this day. In 1905 the draw of professionalism proved too strong, and Jowett headed north to play for Hull Kingston Rovers, severing his ties with rugby union forever.\nDuring World War I, Jowett was a corporal in the Welsh ammunition column.\nInternational matches played\nWales\n England 1903British Lions\n\n Australia 1904", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Jowett", "response": ["* ILP@120: Fred Jowett \u2013 \u2018A great man of a new kind'"]}, {"page": "Fred Jowett (rugby union)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Jowett (rugby)"]}, {"page": "Fred Jowett (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Jowett (rugby)"]}]}}
