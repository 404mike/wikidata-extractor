Their burlesques include The Enchanted Isle (1848), Medea (1856), Masaniello (1857), The Sphinx (1849) and The Last Edition of Ivanhoe (1850).

J. Byron's success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.Speaight, George. \"All froth and bubble\", The Times Literary Supplement, 1 October 1976, p. 1233 Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. Verdi's Il trovatore and La traviata received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  Our Lady of the Cameleon by Leicester Silk Buckingham and Our Traviata by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of Il trovatore, two of them by H. J. Byron: Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer (1863) and Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto (1880).Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. \"Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture\", Cambridge Opera Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33\u201366, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011  The operas of Bellini, Bizet, Donizetti, Gounod, Handel, Meyerbeer, Mozart, Rossini, Wagner and Weber were burlesqued.

While in London he befriended the artist and caricaturist Joseph Kenny Meadows and the writer Charles Dickens whom he accompanied on expeditions to the slums, to help discover material for Dickens' books. While in London, Francis also met John Ruskin and William Thackery. In 1857, he became a founding member of the Savage Club, a literary gentleman's society, attending the society's first meeting in Drury Lane with William Brough, Leicester Silk Buckingham and William Bernhardt Tegetmeier among others. It is also possible that Francis was responsible for the name of the Society since 'it was he who presented the Club with the tomahawks, assegais and other savage weapons that decorated the walls of the Club.'"]}]}}
