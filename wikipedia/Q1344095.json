He was the first (in 1864) to propose that the bones found in the German valley of Neanderthal in 1856 were not of Homo sapiens, but of a distinct species: Homo neanderthalensis.  He proposed the name of this new species at a meeting of the British Association in 1863, with the written version published in 1864.", "link_mentions": {}}}
