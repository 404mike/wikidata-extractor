He played in the Football League for Exeter City, Southport and Wigan Athletic. Born in Romford, Gay's family moved to Tarvin and then Winsford in the North-West of England.Gay turned professional with Bolton Wanderers in June 1975, having spent two years with Bolton as an apprentice. He joined Exeter City on loan in March 1977. On his debut for Exeter, away to Crewe Alexandra, Gay took over in goal after City keeper Richard Key broke his ankle. This was the first time in Exeter City's history that a debutant outfield player had taken over in goal.Released by Bolton, he moved to Southport in August 1977, playing 40 times in Southport's final season in the Football League as they failed to gain re-election at the end of the season. In July 1978, Gay joined Wigan Athletic who had taken Southport's place as a League club. He played just once, in Wigan's first ever home game in the Football league, against Grimsby Town.He left Wigan later that year, joining Macclesfield Town. This was followed by short spells with Bangor City and Crewe Alexandra before returning to Macclesfield Town in 1979. In December 1982, while playing for Macclesfield against Witton Albion, Gay broke his leg in three places and required the insertion of a metal plate. He later joined Mossley, Droylsden and Chorley before a second spell with Macclesfield, rejoining Mossley from there in the 1986 close season. He left Mossley in October 1986, joining Horwich RMI.Away from football, Gay became a civil servant working for the Employment Department.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gay (surname)", "response": ["*Geoff Gay (born 1957), English former professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| Geoff Gay || MF || Southport ||  || Summer 1978", "| Geoff Gay || MF || Macclesfield Town ||  || 1978"]}]}}
