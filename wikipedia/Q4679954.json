Alongside Hedley Bull, Martin Wight, Herbert Butterfield, and others, he was one of the founding members of the English school of international relations theory.\nHe was born John Hugh Watson and educated at Rugby and King's College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate at Cambridge, where he read History, Watson was taught by Herbert Butterfield (later Sir Herbert, and Regius Professor of History). After a period of travel in central Europe in the late 1930s, he joined the British Diplomatic Service in 1937, taking the nickname Adam \"after noticing that every head in the Foreign Office seemed to turn when someone asked for John\". During the Second World War he acted as a liaison with the Free French in Cairo, played an unknown role in the Balkans, based in Bucharest, and was finally posted to Moscow, where he witnessed the victory celebrations of 1945, standing alongside the Soviet Politburo (see Problems of Adjustment in the Middle East (1952), 61) and where he remained for the next four years.\nIn 1949 Watson joined the Foreign Office's new Information Research Department (IRD), which the historian Richard Aldrich has described as a 'covert political warfare section', as successor to the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) that had operated during the Second World War. A key figure in this organisation, he was first assistant to its Head, Ralph Murray, with the job of recruiting 'left-of-centre intellectuals' for the production of anti-communist 'grey' propaganda, and was later posted to Washington (Andrew Defty, Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda (Routledge, 2004)). In the USA he served as Britain's 'psywar [psychological warfare] liaison officer' (Aldrich) in Washington between 1950 and sometime in the mid-1950s, before becoming Head of the African Department of the Foreign Office during the Suez Crisis of 1956. He served as Her Majesty's Ambassador to Mali (1960\u201361), Senegal, Mauritania and Togo (1960\u201362), and finally Cuba (1962\u201366). He returned to London in 1966 to spend two years as Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office before retiring early. After a period with British Leyland in the late 1960s, he entered academia, first at the Australian National University, at the invitation of Hedley Bull, and then in the United States, where he was Professor of International Studies at the University of Virginia.\nIn the late 1950s, it is likely that, given his extensive contacts in the United States and together with Kenneth W. Thompson, Watson was instrumental in facilitating the funding of the British Committee on the Theory of International Politics, chaired in its early years by his former supervisor, Butterfield, and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Watson became a member of Committee, attending when he was in the UK, and later becoming its third chairman, in succession to Butterfield and to Martin Wight. He was instrumental in the production of The Expansion of International Society (1984), edited with Hedley Bull, a key text of the English school of international relations. He also wrote a number of other significant works, including The Nature and Problems of the Third World (1968), Diplomacy (1982) and The Evolution of International Society (1992), a wide-ranging comparative study of historical international systems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Watson", "response": ["*John Watson (1914\u20132007), known as Adam Watson, British international relations theorist and researcher, and ambassador"]}, {"page": "Olivia Manning", "response": ["The Smiths initially rented a flat, but later moved in with the diplomat Adam Watson, who was working with the British Legation. Those who knew Manning at the time described her as a shy, provincial girl who had little experience with other cultures. She was both dazzled and appalled by Romania. The caf\u00e9 society, with its wit and gossip, appealed to her, but she was repelled by the peasantry and the aggressive, often mutilated, beggars. Her Romanian experiences were captured in the first two volumes of The Balkan Trilogy (The Great Fortune and The Spoilt City), considered one of the most important literary treatments of Romania during the war. In her novels, Manning described Bucharest as being on the margins of European civilisation, \"a strange, half-Oriental capital\" that was \"primitive, bug-ridden and brutal\", whose citizens were peasants, whatever their wealth or status.", "Arriving in Alexandria, the refugees gratefully devoured the food provided by the British military, but learned that the swastika was now flying over the Acropolis. Manning's first impressions of Egypt were of squalor and unreality: \"For weeks we lived in a state of recoil\". From Alexandria they went by train to Cairo, where they renewed contact with Adam Watson, who was now Second Secretary at the British Embassy.

In the classical English School these were: war, the great powers, diplomacy, the balance of power, and international law, especially in the mutual recognition of sovereignty by states. To these could be added: territoriality, nationalism, the market, and human equality. Since these rules are not legally binding and there is no ordering institutions, speaking of norms would probably be more appropriate. States that respect these basic rules form an international society. Brown and Ainley therefore define the international society as a \"norm-governed relationship whose members accept that they have at least limited responsibilities towards one another and the society as a whole\". States thus follow their interests, but not at all costs. Another way of looking at this would be through Adam Watson's term 'raison de syst\u00e8me', a counterpoint to 'raison d'\u00e9tat', and defined as 'the idea that it pays to make the system work'.Adam Watson, The Evolution of International Society, 1992, p. 14.", "* Hedley Bull and Adam Watson (eds.), \"The Expansion of International Society\" (1984)", "* Adam Watson, (1992) The Evolution of International Society, London: Routledge.
