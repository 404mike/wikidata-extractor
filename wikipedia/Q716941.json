Despite being assigned as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Umbridge refuses to teach anything practical in the subject, which leads to the formation of Dumbledore's Army as a way for the students to learn how to defend themselves. Umbridge is described as a fat, toad-like woman, with a wide, slack mouth, and a large bow usually in her hair.\nCritics have recognised Umbridge as one of the most hated, as well as the most compelling, villains in the series.
