Shailer Mathews called Drews' theory a \"modern docetism\". Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare thought any connection to be based on a misunderstanding of docetism. The idea recurred in classicist Michael Grant's 1977 review of the evidence for Jesus, who compared modern scepticism about a historical Jesus to the ancient docetic idea that Jesus only seemed to come into the world \"in the flesh\". Modern supporters of the theory did away with \"seeming\".

Lemerle noted that Conybeare translated Anania's autobiography from a Russian translation, and it contains numerous serious errors. Renewed interest in Anania's work emerged in the West in the 1960s. A French translation of his autobiography appeared in 1964 by Ha\u00efg Berb\u00e9rian. Robert H. Hewsen authored an introductory article on Anania's life and scholarship in 1968."]}]}}
