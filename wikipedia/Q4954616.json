The ivories mostly originated outside Mesopotamia and are thought to have been made in the Levant and Egypt, and have frequently been attributed to the Phoenicians due to a number of the ivories containing Phoenician inscriptions.Richard David Barnett. \u201cThe Nimrud Ivories and the Art of the Phoenicians\u201d Iraq, vol. 2, no. 2, British Institute for the Study of Iraq, 1935, pp. 179\u2013210, https://doi.org/10.2307/4241579. \u201cThe Nationality of the NW.

Posterity, a few dissentients apart, has followed Lenormant, and some wilder misattributions might have been avoided had it been noticed, as stated above, that in Layard's group seven pieces bore a letter of the Phoenician alphabet, and in that of Loftus were two inscriptions apparently also Phoenician.

He also wrote a popular book, The Babylonian Legend of the Flood (1962), as well as Inscriptions Royales Sumeriennes et Akkadiennes (with Robert Kupper, 1971); he edited The Pinches Manuscript (1978) and authored Administrative Texts Chiefly Concerning Textiles (1981).
