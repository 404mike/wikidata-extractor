Davis eventually went for 18, but that brought Kim Hughes to the crease. Although scoring less prolifically, Hughes capably supported Chappell as he moved towards a well-deserved century, falling on 102. It was enough to prop up the Australian second innings, and solid contributions from Hughes (27), Doug Walters (24), Richie Robinson (26), and Max Walker (22) took Australia to 251 all out. Gloucestershire required an unlikely 343 for victory, and never looked like they would reach the target. Andy Stovold made 27, and Jim Foat and David Shepherd both chipped in with 26 each, but Gloucentershire were all out for 169. Len Pascoe (4/36) and Ray Bright (4/63) were the pick of the Australian bowlers, as they wrapped up a deserved victory by 173 runs in two days."]}, {"page": "Bob Dudley-Jones", "response": ["Bob Dudley-Jones was born in Bridgend, Glamorgan, and educated at Millfield School, where his teammates in the undefeated First XI in 1970 included David Graveney, Peter Roebuck and Jim Foat.Wisden 1971, pp. 821\u201322.
