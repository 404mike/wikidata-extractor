He survived a downing by German ace Ulrich Neckel on 28 February 1918, only to be killed in action, possibly by Hans Wolff. He was the younger brother of British ace James McCudden. McCudden's victor cannot be identified for certain since more than one German pilot made a claim in that combat. Wolff died in action only two months later, and his log book disappeared after the end of the war, and with it, details of the battle from his perspective.", "link_mentions": {}}}
