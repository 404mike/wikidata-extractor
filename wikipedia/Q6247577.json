He survived a downing by German ace Ulrich Neckel on 28 February 1918, only to be killed in action, possibly by Hans Wolff. He was the younger brother of British ace James McCudden. McCudden's victor cannot be identified for certain since more than one German pilot made a claim in that combat. Wolff died in action only two months later, and his log book disappeared after the end of the war, and with it, details of the battle from his perspective.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "No. 84 Squadron RAF", "response": ["* John McCudden, World War I ace"]}, {"page": "James McCudden", "response": ["On the morning of 9 July 1918 he travelled to the home of his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Alex-Tweedie in Whitehall Court. Tweedie recalled their conversation revolved around his new posting and his book. He had delivered the manuscript to Mr. Grey two days earlier, and was expecting its publication. While there, McCudden promised to surpass von Richthofen, who had been killed in action on 21 April 1918. In view of what happened to von Richthofen and John McCudden, he promised that \"I won't bustle, or do anything foolish like my brother\". He then went next door, and had breakfast with his sister Mary. Upon leaving, he fumbled around in his pocket and handed her a bulky envelope containing his Victoria Cross and other decorations. He took his leave of her and drove to Hounslow, where he climbed into his S.E.5a (C1126). He took off shortly after 13:00. McCudden certainly stopped en route, since about six o'clock that afternoon he called the AOC No. 13 Wing, Patrick Playfair, to announce his imminent arrival at Boffles, where No. 60 Squadron was stationed."]}, {"page": "Ulrich Neckel", "response": ["Neckel next achieved a victory on 18 January 1918 and steadily accumulated claims, with his fifth on 26 February.
