Menelaws achieved success in the first two decades of the 19th century as the designer of town and country residences and parks of Razumovsky and Stroganov families, and later worked for emperor Alexander I, specializing in Gothic Revival architecture. From 1825 to 1831 Menelaws, then in his seventies, became the first house architect of Nicholas I and de facto the leading architect of the Empire.

The earlier water system, linking the garden's ponds with the castle's watercourses, was otherwise retained, and further expanded with an underground channel linking the garden's large pond with the Moyka.
