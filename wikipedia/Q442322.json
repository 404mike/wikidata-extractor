Their debut single, \"Storm\" reached No. 1 in the UK Independent Chart and were then signed to London Records. Their second album, The Drum Is Everything (produced by Mike Thorne) drew some praise.

That album was followed by 1995's World's Gone Crazy, with its producers including Carmel McCourt, Jim Parris, Gerry Darby, Julian Mendelsohn and Mike Thorne. A single was released from World's Gone Crazy, the ballad \"If You Don't Come Back\", an English-language version of \"Si tu no vuelves\" by the Spanish singer-songwriter and actor, Miguel Bos\u00e9.
