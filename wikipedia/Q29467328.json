This latter perspective is intimately related to a curious Laplace transform between isomonodromy equations with different pole structure and rank for the underlying equations.", "The isomonodromy equations arise as (generic) full dimensional reductions of (generalized) anti-self-dual Yang\u2013Mills equations. By the Penrose\u2013Ward transform they can therefore be interpreted in terms of holomorphic vector bundles on complex manifolds called twistor spaces. This allows the use of powerful techniques from algebraic geometry in studying the properties of transcendents. This approach has been pursued by Nigel Hitchin, Lionel Mason and Nick Woodhouse."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Woodhouse", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nick Woodhouse"]}, {"page": "N.M.J.
