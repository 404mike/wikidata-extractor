God will give the victory.\" Five thousand women formed a procession, followed by hundreds of male supporters, that took the body between Victoria and Kings Cross stations; the procession stopped at St George's, Bloomsbury for a brief service led by its vicar, Charles Baumgarten, and Claude Hinscliff, who were members of the Church League for Women's Suffrage. The women marched in ranks wearing the suffragette colours of white and purple, which The Manchester Guardian described as having \"something of the deliberate brilliance of a military funeral\"; 50,000 people lined the route. The event, which was organised by Grace Roe, is described by June Purvis, Davison's biographer, as \"the last of the great suffragette spectacles\". Emmeline Pankhurst planned to be part of the procession, but she was arrested on the morning, ostensibly to be returned to prison under the \"Cat and Mouse\" Act (1913)."]}, {"page": "Hatfield College, Durham", "response": ["Politicians and campaigners who have attended the college include Robert Buckland, a former Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor; Edward Timpson, the MP for Eddisbury and former Minister of State for Children and Families; and Labour Party life peer Baron Carter of Coles.
