He also wrote widely on true crime, mysticism and the paranormal, eventually writing more than a hundred books.  Wilson called his philosophy \"new existentialism\" or \"phenomenological existentialism\", and maintained his life work was \"that of a philosopher, and (his) purpose to create a new and optimistic existentialism\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cornwall", "response": ["Colin Wilson, a prolific writer who is best known for his debut work The Outsider (1956) and for The Mind Parasites (1967), lived in Gorran Haven, a small village on the southern Cornish coast.

In this book and others (e.g. Introduction to the New Existentialism), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.K.

Howard, stating that \"they appear more prolific than ever,\" noting L. Sprague de Camp, Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg, and August Derleth's usage of their creations. Gale also said that \"Lovecraft at his best could build a mood of horror unsurpassed; at his worst, he was laughable.\" In 1962, Colin Wilson, in his survey of anti-realist trends in fiction The Strength to Dream, cited Lovecraft as one of the pioneers of the \"assault on rationality\" and included him with M. R. James, H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, J. R. R. Tolkien and others as one of the builders of mythicised realities contending against what he considered the failing project of literary realism. Subsequently, Lovecraft began to acquire the status of a cult writer in the counterculture of the 1960s, and reprints of his work proliferated."]}, {"page": "Hermann Hesse", "response": ["By the time of Hesse's death in 1962, his works were still relatively little read in the United States, despite his status as a Nobel laureate. A memorial published in The New York Times went so far as to claim that Hesse's works were largely \"inaccessible\" to American readers. The situation changed in the mid-1960s, when Hesse's works suddenly became bestsellers in the United States.Zeller, p. 185 The revival in popularity of Hesse's works has been credited to their association with some of the popular themes of the 1960s counterculture (or hippie) movement. In particular, the quest-for-enlightenment theme of Siddhartha, Journey to the East, and Narcissus and Goldmund resonated with those espousing counter-cultural ideals. The \"magic theatre\" sequences in Steppenwolf were interpreted by some as drug-induced psychedelia although there is no evidence that Hesse ever took psychedelic drugs or recommended their use.Zeller p. 189 In large part, the Hesse boom in the United States can be traced back to enthusiastic writings by two influential counter-culture figures: Colin Wilson and Timothy Leary.Zeller, p. 188 From the United States, the Hesse renaissance spread to other parts of the world and even back to Germany: more than 800,000 copies were sold in the German-speaking world from 1972 to 1973. In a space of just a few years, Hesse became the most widely read and translated European author of the 20th century.
