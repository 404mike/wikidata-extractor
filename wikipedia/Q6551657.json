Affinity played numerous London gigs and radio sessions, attracting the attention of jazz club impresario, Ronnie Scott, who became their manager. Scott secured a record deal with Vertigo Records who chose John Anthony, who had produced albums for Genesis, Queen and Roxy Music, to produce their one, eponymous album. Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones wrote brass and string arrangements for the collection of self-penned tracks and cover-versions. The album was released in 1970, to a strong reception from the press and broadcasters. However, despite television appearances, and concerts across Europe, the album didn\u2019t sell well, and Linda Hoyle chose not to continue in music.

The album was produced by her long time friend and former bandmate Mo Foster. On 29 June 2015 Hoyle released a promotional video for the album's first track, \"The Fetch\".", "Although Hoyle and Foster had remained good friends since working together in the early 1970s, it was not until 40 years later that they decided to write and record together again. The impetus for this was a performance (released as The Baskervilles Reunion 2011) at Sussex University's 50th anniversary celebration. With Hoyle living in Canada and Foster in the UK it was difficult to negotiate a working process, so it is not surprising that The Fetch took nearly three years to make. Logic Pro and Pro Tools were vital ingredients in the success of the project, though few of the musicians found working under these circumstances an optimal procedure. Although most recording is now undertaken in this way, the separation of musician from musician requires enormous attention to rhythmic detail and cohesion. After about a year of recording, Foster and Roger Wake, who was the recording engineer on Pieces of Me, travelled to Canada to mix the album over a two-week period. Wake then mastered the final mix in his studio in Lisbon. For more details, see Tom Semioli's \"From Affinity to the Fetch: My Conversation With Linda Hoyle and Mo Foster\" and Alan D. Boyd's video \"Linda Hoyle: The Fetch\", describing the making of the album.", "Music critic Tom Semioli wrote in the Huffington Post \"[...] Linda Hoyle follows Pieces of Me with a new studio album entitled The Fetch. With lyrics described as \"autobiographical, witty, and dark\" - Affinity fans spanning generations will surely be overjoyed. It's as if Linda never left...\"", "In The Progressive Aspect, Roger Trenwith wrote \"Linda\u2019s voice is as clear as ever [...]. Listen no further than the delightful Brighton Pier or Snowy Night for proof. Fortuna is a highlight, a slightly world-weary tale backed by a Hammond-led slow blues containing a delightful organ solo by Jim Watson [...]. Linda has always had a folk influence in her work, and the fiddle, mandolin and accordion on It\u2019s The World takes this tradition onwards. Earth And Stars goes further back in time and sounds like a modern take on a medieval madrigal [...]. The Fetch is a highly enjoyable album that defies easy categorisation \u2013 Linda would not have it any other way! \u2013 and one that any lover of \u201cthe song\u201d in all its forms will enjoy, a must for those of us who remember, even at some years remove via the arcane delights of record collecting, the belting jazz rock of Affinity and Linda's more eclectic 1970 solo album Pieces Of Me. Linda, having rediscovered her muse, is eager to make more music, and with the tantalising prospect of UK gigs in the hopefully not too distant future, things are looking good for Linda Hoyle, and I for one will be following this late blooming with anticipation.\"", "Some Awe wrote in Some Diurnal Aural Awe \"And now Hoyle has released her latest solo album The Fetch, and this too is brilliant: both that she has returned to performing after all these years, and the album itself. Her distinctive tone is still there, completely, as is the power of her voice. Hoyle is one of the great female rock vocalists \u2013 not in the Janis Joplin sense; not the growl of this fine type \u2013 and it is the album Affinity that has always exemplified this most for me, especially songs like Three Sisters and the competing-with-Hendrix cover of Dylan\u2019s  All Along the Watchtower, Hoyle stamping that pure tone and strength on these and all tracks. She is perhaps better described as a jazzy vocalist, but best as simply superb. The Fetch doesn\u2019t \u2018rock\u2019 as much as was the case in the 70s, but the tracks instead showcase the clarity and absolute sweet replication of the tone she has always had. The opener and title track is one of the liveliest on the album, her vocal starting in an exotic and atmospheric overlay before dropping into the sassy melody, a melodious resonating tone that is exquisite. Then the shift: an oriental-esque rap, before we are swooned back to the melody. 44 years? Gone. As if nothing has changed, at all. Third Confessional is a brooding jazz ballad and reminds me of the Affinity cover of the Sebastian/Yanovsky song Coconut Grove, again the vocal tone so pure and smooth. Fourth is a beautiful folk song Brighton Pier, the town where I believe Hoyle now lives. Fifth It\u2019s the World is a polished blues with sass again, this time the violin. 'You try to fuck with a lady luck' sustains that sass as lyrics in the following blues of Fortuna, organ and horns pumping out some proper oomph. Ninth Maida Vale begins with snippets of radio announcement, including references to jazz and Affinity and Linda Hoyle and Mo Foster, so echoes of the past, and the song is quirky as lyrical reflection on that past, referring to music contracts and tube stations and the BBC and black and white and two track tape, so personal recollections on recording and living, and a guitar sound from The Stylistics. Hoyle's voice is sublime throughout. Penultimate track Earth and Stars is as \u2018psychedelic\u2019 as it gets, not that Affinity and Hoyle ever were, but the backwards vocal loops and effects are entirely atmospheric, with an electronic choral layer that is gorgeous [...]. This is a surprising return, and a triumphant one. The album has genuine depths in the songwriting and production, while Hoyle's singing is timewarped from the 70s in an astonishing resurrection of talent. Closer Acknowledgements is a hoot, by the way: a hymnal litany of other singers/performers as influence, and acknowledgement of such.\"", "Goldmine Magazine remarked \"Long ago and far away, Linda Hoyle was vocal and focal point of Affinity, one of the more incendiary of the jazz rock bands flaming on the edges of British prog.  A single album for Vertigo at the height of its swirly iconography, was their legacy; a solo Hoyle album their final last breath. But Angel Air has worked marvels in keeping the band\u2019s name alive, with both reissued and unreleased archive albums, and now Hoyle herself resurfaces, alongside Affinity bassist Mo Foster, and a newly written and recorded album that can truly be viewed as a fresh beginning, even as it echoes back to her past. The Hoyle voice remains a thing of beauty; her willingness to stretch is deserving of your awe. [...] There are a few moments where the playing maybe gets a little slick; where the feral vision that is Hoyle at her best could be said to have taken a back seat.  But visionary lyrics and a voice that drips expression are never far from view, and The Fetch lines up among this year\u2019s most unexpected comebacks, as well as one of its most welcome.\"", "Progressive Tracks wrote \"Anyone remember Affinity?  Well, Linda Hoyle was the wonderful voice behind that group in the early 70\u2032s [...] before she left music to pursue a career in art therapy.  Now Linda\u2019s back with a new solo album\u2026 and her voice seems as if a single day has passed, instead of 45 years.\"", "Distorsioni wrote \"Now, after an impromptu reunion with Affinity in 2006 Linda Hoyle back dramatically on the scene after 44 years with this wonderful \"The Fetch\", ideal continuation of a musical journey abandoned too quickly.\"", "*Linda Hoyle \u2013 Vocals"]}]}}
