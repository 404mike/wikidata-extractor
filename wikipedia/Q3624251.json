In 1903, Burnley built a second tier on the Brunshaw Road Stand to accommodate club offices, and in September of that year, the club hosted its first annual general meeting at Turf Moor. The Stars Stand was extended in 1909 with new turnstiles and barricades erected in preparation for the FA Cup quarter-final game against reigning Football League champions Manchester United. In 1911, the club unveiled plans for the rebuilding of the Brunshaw Road Stand; former Burnley forward Arthur Bell was the architect for the project. A strike amongst railway workers delayed the deliveries of steelwork for the new roof but spectators were still able to use the stand in time for Burnley's first league game of the 1911\u201312 season against Leeds City. Work on the dressing rooms had not been completed so players from both teams changed in the adjoining cricket pavilion. The stand cost the club \u00a35,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 as of ) and could accommodate over 5,500 spectators, including 2,200 seated places.Simpson (2007), p. 575 By this time an L-shaped embankment had been constructed, possibly with spoil from the coal mine, stretching from the eastern goal around the northeast corner to the halfway line.Williamson (1999), pp. 15\u201316"]}, {"page": "Bell (surname)", "response": ["* Arthur Bell (disambiguation), multiple people, including:", "**Arthur Bell (martyr) (1590\u20131643), Franciscan and English martyr", "**Arthur Bell (cricketer) (1869\u20131946), New Zealand cricketer", "**Arthur Bell (engineer) (1856\u20131943), engineer active in New Zealand and Western Australia", "**Arthur Bell (footballer) (1882\u20131923), Burnley footballer", "**Arthur Bell (rower) (1899\u20131963), Canadian Olympic rower", "**Arthur Bell (journalist) (1939\u20131984), columnist for the Village Voice and LGBT rights activist"]}, {"page": "Burnley Cricket Club", "response": ["*Arthur Bell.Also played football for Burnley."]}, {"page": "Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team squads", "response": ["The following players were also part of Great Britain's squad, but did not play in any matches: Bill Bayley, Arthur Bell, John Charnley, P.
