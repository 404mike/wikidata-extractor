He then served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, while playing as a guest for Leicester City, Blackpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Tranmere Rovers and Arsenal. Paterson's career with Celtic came to an end after he incurred a three-month suspension for vociferously arguing with the referee (whom he felt was under the influence of alcohol) during Celtic's 1946 Victory Cup semi-final against rivals Rangers.Paterson moved to England to sign for Brentford, then became player-manager of Yeovil and Petters United. He then managed Stirling Albion for a season before working variously for Celtic as a reserve team trainer and a scout.", "link_mentions": {}}}
