George Villiers (23 November 1759 \u2013 21 March 1827) was a British courtier and politician from the Villiers family. The youngest son of the diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers was more interested in the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than \u00a3250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, and he was able to retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Villiers", "response": ["George Villiers may refer to:", "* George Villiers (of Brokesby) (\u20131606), minor English gentleman, father of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham", "* George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592\u20131628), courtier of James I of England, minister to Charles I", "* George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (1628\u20131687), English politician, son of the first Duke, exiled with Charles II", "* George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey (1735\u20131805), English Member of Parliament for Tamworth, Aldborough, Dover", "* George Villiers (1759\u20131827), English Member of Parliament for Warwick", "* George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon (1800\u20131870), English diplomat and statesman, Foreign Secretary", "* George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon (1877\u20131955), British Conservative politician, Governor-General of South Africa", "* George Villiers, 8th Earl of Clarendon (born 1976)"]}, {"page": "Charles Pelham Villiers", "response": ["Villiers was the son of the Hon.
