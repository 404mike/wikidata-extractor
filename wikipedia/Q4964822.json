The popular sixteenth-century English Protestant historian John Foxe, who \"placed Protestant sufferings against the background of... the Antichrist\",Diarmaid MacCulloch, 277. was instrumental in publicising accusations of torture in his Book of Martyrs, claiming that More had often personally used violence or torture while interrogating heretics. Later authors such as Brian Moynahan and Michael Farris cite Foxe when repeating these allegations.."]}, {"page": "William Tyndale", "response": ["Brian Moynahan writes: \"A complete analysis of the Authorised Version, known down the generations as 'the AV' or 'the King James', was made in 1998. It shows that Tyndale's words account for 84% of the New Testament and for 75.8% of the Old Testament books that he translated.\" Joan Bridgman makes the comment in the Contemporary Review that, \"He [Tyndale] is the mainly unrecognised translator of the most influential book in the world. Although the Authorised King James Version is ostensibly the production of a learned committee of churchmen, it is mostly cribbed from Tyndale with some reworking of his translation.\""]}, {"page": "Khlysts", "response": ["In The Man Behind the Myth, co-authored by Rasputin's daughter Maria, it is claimed that Rasputin attended several Khlyst gatherings in the years before his arrival in St. Petersberg, but ultimately became disillusioned with the sect. The factual accuracy of this book has been called into question, and according to Brian Moynahan, Maria's story is the only evidence that Rasputin had any Khlyst connections. The consensus of modern historians is that Rasputin was never a member of the sect."]}, {"page": "Marc Chagall", "response": ["*Brian Moynahan, Comrades 1917-Russian in Revolution, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1992, ."]}, {"page": "Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3", "response": ["K\u1ef3 did not value democratic ideals.
