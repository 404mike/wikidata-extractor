Original music was written for the production by local composer Richard Shephard.", "In 2016 the plays were performed in York Minster from 26 May, the feast of Corpus Christi, until 30 June. The director, Phillip Breen, had previously directed for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production featured a large step set by designers Max Jones and Ruth Hall, that was dissected by a thin gauze that reached to the vaulted ceiling, which was utilised as a projection screen by projection designer Douglas O'Connell.  Writer Mike Poulton and composer Richard Shephard repeated their millennium production roles. The cast had about 150 amateur actors and the sole professional, Philip McGinley, played Jesus except for the last four performances, when,  owing to his sudden illness, the role was taken by his understudy Toby Gordon who had, up to then, played Satan. This caused a cascade of understudying which was superbly handled by a committed cast. It also elevated Toby Gordon into the \u2018Crew of Two\u2019 with Rory Mulvihill as the only actors in the history of the plays to have played both Jesus and Satan."]}, {"page": "Shepherd (name)", "response": ["*Richard Shephard (1949\u20132021), British choral music composer"]}, {"page": "St Matthew's Church, Northampton", "response": ["* 1989 \u2013 Richard Shephard \u2013 St Matthew's Mass"]}, {"page": "Psalm 31", "response": ["In the 21st century, Nobuaki Izawa set \"Illumina faciem tuam\" as a four-part motet, published in 2016.
