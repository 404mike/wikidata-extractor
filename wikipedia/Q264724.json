She is the daughter of Nigel Lawson, Lord Lawson of Blaby, a former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (n\u00e9e Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business.\nShe attended Godolphin and Latymer School, London. After graduating from the University of Oxford, where she was a member of Lady Margaret Hall, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then embarked upon a career as a freelance journalist, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines. In 1998 her first cookery book, How to Eat, was published and sold 300,000 copies, becoming a best-seller. Her second book, How to Be a Domestic Goddess, was published in 2000, winning the British Book Award for Author of the Year.\nIn 1999 Lawson hosted her own cooking show series, Nigella Bites, on Channel 4, accompanied by another best-selling cookbook. Nigella Bites won Lawson a Guild of Food Writers Award; her 2005 ITV daytime chat show Nigella met with a negative critical reaction and was cancelled after attracting low ratings. She hosted the Food Network's Nigella Feasts in the United States in 2006, followed by a three-part BBC Two series, Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, in the UK, which led to the commissioning of Nigella Express on BBC Two in 2007. Her own cookware range, Living Kitchen, has a value of \u00a37 million, and she has sold more than 8 million cookery books worldwide to date.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Food writing", "response": ["*Nigella Lawson"]}, {"page": "January 6", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 Nigella Lawson, English chef and author"]}, {"page": "Marmite", "response": ["Celebrity chefs have created signature Marmite-flavored recipes: Nigella Lawson has one for Marmite spaghetti, and Heston Blumenthal has one for Marmite consomm\u00e9."]}, {"page": "Twiglets", "response": ["*Twiglets are the favourite snack of footballer Ian Wright, former Prime Minister David Cameron, and food writer Nigella Lawson."]}, {"page": "1960", "response": ["** Nigella Lawson, English journalist, broadcaster, television personality, gourmet and food writer"]}, {"page": "Hermione Granger", "response": ["Hermione has been parodied in numerous sketches and animated series.
