This spans the period between first matches to have been given retrospective first-class status in 1772 to the formation of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1787. A total of 67 first-class matches were played during this period.\nCricket during this period became increasingly similar to the modern game, although bowling remained underarm until the 19th century. The first Laws of Cricket had been established in 1744 and in 1774 a revision of the Laws added Leg before wicket as a mode of dismissal. The third stump was added after 1775.Cricket scorecards became increasingly complete from 1772 onwards and the players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1772 and 1786 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mansfield (disambiguation)", "response": ["Mansfield is a town in Nottinghamshire, England, pop. est 100,000", "Mansfield may also refer to:", "* Mansfield, Queensland, a suburb of Brisbane", "** Mansfield State High School", "* Mansfield, Victoria", "* Electoral district of Mansfield, Queensland, Australia", "* Mansfield Park, South Australia, a suburb of Adelaide", "* Mansfield, Nova Scotia", "* Mansfield, Ontario", "* Mansfield Township, Quebec, part of the Municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract", "* Mansfield, East Ayrshire, a small hamlet in Ayrshire, Scotland", "* Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, main town of Mansfield District, Nottinghamshire, England", "** Mansfield District, the local council administrative area ", "** Mansfield (UK Parliament constituency), largely centred around the eponymous town", "* Mansfield Woodhouse, a large village connected to Mansfield, Nottinghamshire", "* Mansfield Lake, Alaska, a lake 16.6 miles from Tok, Alaska", "* Mansfield, Arkansas, a city of 1,100", "* Mansfield, Connecticut, a town of 24,000", "** Mansfield Center, Connecticut, a census-designated place within the town of Mansfield", "**Mansfield Center Historic District, listed on the NRHP in Connecticut", "* Mannfield, Florida, sometimes incorrectly called Mansfield", "* Mansfield, Georgia", "* Mansfield, Illinois", "* Mansfield, Indiana", "* Mansfield, Kansas", "*Mansfield (Lexington, Kentucky), listed on the NRHP in Kentucky", "* Mansfield, Louisiana", "**Mansfield Historic District, Mansfield, Louisiana, listed on the NRHP in Louisiana", "**Battle of Mansfield, a battle in the Civil War.", "**Mansfield Battle Park, Mansfield, Louisiana, listed on the NRHP in Louisiana", "* Mansfield, Massachusetts", "**Mansfield station (MBTA)", "* Mansfield Township, Freeborn County, Minnesota", "* Mansfield, Minnesota", "* Mansfield, Missouri", "* Mansfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey", "* Mansfield Township, Warren County, New Jersey", "* Mansfield, New York", "* Mansfield, Ohio, the second largest city in the United States named Mansfield", "**Ohio State Reformatory, also known as the Mansfield Reformatory, a historic prison located in Mansfield, Ohio.", "* Mansfield, Pennsylvania", "**Mansfield (Mercersburg, Pennsylvania), listed on the NRHP in Pennsylvania", "**Mansfield University of Pennsylvania", "*Mansfield Plantation, Georgetown, South Carolina, listed on the NRHP in South Carolina", "* Mansfield, South Dakota", "* Mansfield, Tennessee", "* Mansfield, Texas, the largest city in the United States named Mansfield", "* Mansfield, Vermont (1763\u20131839), historic township annexed by Underhill, Vermont and Stowe, Vermont", "** Mount Mansfield, the highest mountain in Vermont", "* Mansfield (Petersburg, Virginia), listed on the NRHP in Virginia", "* Mansfield, Washington", "* Mansfield, West Virginia", "* Mansfield (surname), people with the surname", "* Mansfield (All-England cricketer, 1778)", "* Mansfield Smith-Cumming, British spymaster", "* Lord Mansfield (William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield) (1705\u20131793), British jurist", "**Mansfield Decision of 1772, ruling that there was no legal basis for slavery in the United Kingdom", "* Mansfield station (disambiguation), stations of the name", "* \"Mansfield\", a song by Elton John, on the album Songs from the West Coast", "* Mansfield College, Oxford, a college of Oxford University", "* Mansfield Dam near Austin, Texas", "* Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation, named after Mike Mansfield, dedicated to \"advancing understanding and cooperation in U.S.-Asia relations\"", "* Mansfield Park, novel by Jane Austen", "* HMS Mansfield, Royal Navy ships", "* USS Mansfield, United States Navy destroyer", "* Mansfield University of Pennsylvania ", "* Mount Mansfield, the highest peak in Vermont, USA", "* Bruce Mansfield Power Plant, a power plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania", "* Mansfield Park (disambiguation)", "* Mansfield Township, New Jersey (disambiguation)", "* Justice Mansfield (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "1778 English cricket season", "response": ["* Mansfield"]}]}}
