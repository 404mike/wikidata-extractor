He has worked on a number of archaeological sites in Britain and abroad. He joined the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (now part of English Heritage) in 1985, and is now head of its Landscape Investigation Team based in York, England.\nHe was affectionately known as Time Team's \"lumps and bumps\" man, working with the team alongside his day job, travelling the country surveying, recording and investigating archaeological sites.\nAs of 2010 Ainsworth has been affiliated with the History and Archaeology department at the University of Chester, where he is a visiting professor.He is President of the Friends of Epiacum, also known as Whitley Castle, the Roman fort on the southern edge of Northumberland which he has surveyed and studied in depth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Time Team", "response": [":Stewart Ainsworth, landscape investigator; John Gater and Chris Gaffney, archaeological geophysicists; Henry Chapman, surveyor; and Victor Ambrus, illustrator.", "On 17\u00a0May 2021, Taylor made an announcement on the return of the series, with episodes planned to air for free on the YouTube channel.

He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been \"dumbed down\", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists\u2014including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus\u2014had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained \"a lot of faffing about.\" In an interview with the magazine British Archaeology Aston said: \"The time had come to leave. I never made any money out of it, but a lot of my soul went into it. I feel really, really angry about it.\""]}, {"page": "University of Chester", "response": ["*Stewart Ainsworth archaeologist (Department of History and Archaeology, 2010\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Banna (Birdoswald)", "response": ["The two-mile sector of Hadrian's Wall either side of Birdoswald is also of major interest. It is currently the only known sector of Hadrian's Wall in which the original turf wall was later replaced by a stone wall on a different line.  When the rebuilding took place (probably in the 130s) the line of the wall was moved approximately 50\u00a0metres further north, to line up with the fort's north wall, rather than its east and west gates.  The reasons for this change are unclear, although David Woolliscroft (Woolliscroft, 2001) has plausibly suggested that it was the result of changing signalling requirements, whilst Stewart Ainsworth of Time Team suggested it was a response to a cliff collapse into the river. At any rate, this remains the only area in which both the walls can be directly compared."]}, {"page": "Ainsworth (surname)", "response": ["* Stewart Ainsworth (born 1951), British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England", "response": ["* Stewart Ainsworth"]}, {"page": "Time Team Digs", "response": ["The series producer of Time Team Digs was Tim Taylor, the creator and producer of Time Team and its predecessor Time Signs.
