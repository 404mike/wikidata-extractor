Clare worked extensively in light entertainment, appearing on BBC Radio and recording with British dance bands. Her distinctive soprano voice saw her working with some of the biggest names of the era, including bandleaders Jack Jackson and Henry Hall. She was one of the last surviving British singers who had been active in the 1930s.", "By 1936, she was broadcasting under her stage name, Helen Clare, which she would be billed as this from this point on. In February 1937, she began broadcasting throughout Britain on the BBC National Programme with Jack Jackson's band, who were resident at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Jackson had spotted her the previous year, and Clare became a household name, taking bookings from the Radio Normandie, Lyon and Luxembourg stations. Whilst there, she was befriended by a young Danny Kaye, who was appearing in cabaret at the hotel. Clare began appearing on BBC Television when the medium was still in its infancy, becoming one of the first female singers to appear on the small screen in 1937. That year, she sang George and Ira Gershwin's \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" in Cabaret Cartoons, a television programme produced by Cecil Madden. On 22 June that year, she made her recording debut at a Rex session with Jay Wilbur and his Band, when Clare sang a duet with Jack Cooper, \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\", which had been introduced by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the film Shall We Dance. She made several more recordings with Wilbur's band, and also broadcast with him.", "On 26 November, she made her first recording with Jack Jackson and his Orchestra at a Decca session in which she sang \"I'm a Little Prairie Flower\" as part of a vocal ensemble with Jackson, Jackie Hunter and Jack Cooper. In December 1937, the Popular Music and Film Song Weekly wrote of Clare:\"\u2026there are relatively few dance-band crooners who possess what the professors would describe as a 'real voice'. Pretty Helen Clare, however is one of the very few. Maybe you can detect the 'quality' when you hear her on the air with Jack Jackson from the Dorchester.\""]}]}}
