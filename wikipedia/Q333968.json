He was also a winner of the De Morgan Medal and the Sylvester Medal, and a Fellow of the Royal Society.\nRoth moved to England as a child in 1933 to escape the Nazis, and was educated at the University of Cambridge and University College London, finishing his doctorate in 1950. He taught at University College London until 1966, when he took a chair at Imperial College London. He retired in 1988.\nBeyond his work on Diophantine approximation, Roth made major contributions to the theory of progression-free sets in arithmetic combinatorics and to the theory of irregularities of distribution. He was also known for his research on sums of powers, on the large sieve, on the Heilbronn triangle problem, and on square packing in a square. He was a coauthor of the book Sequences on integer sequences.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Erd\u0151s number", "response": ["The median Erd\u0151s number among Fields medalists is as low as 3.
