The Admiralty once again instructed the participants to gather such scientific data as \"must prove most valuable and interesting to the science of our country.\" They were to pay particular attention to magnetic measurements, especially the possible interactions between magnetic needles, atmospheric electricity and the aurora borealis.

Some botanists proposed a new spelling sabineana, because they were confused with Latin grammar. The proposal has not been accepted by the relevant authorities (i.e. United States Department of Agriculture, The Jepson Manual or Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN). The GRIN notes that the spelling sabiniana agrees with a provision in the Vienna Code of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, the governing body of botanical nomenclature. In that code, recommendation 60.2C states that personal names can be Latinized in species epithets: 'Sabine' is Latinised to sabinius, with the addition of the suffix \"-anus\" (pertaining to) the word becomes sabiniana (In Latin, trees are feminine, irrespective if the word ends with a masculine suffix, i.e. pinus).International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. 2006.

He concentrated on the genera  Rosa and Digitalis and published the monograph \u201cA Botanical History of Roses\u201d which distinguished seventy-six species, describes thirteen new ones and was illustrated by nineteen coloured plates painted by himself. He became acquainted with Joseph Sabine who grew a large assortment of roses and was the Secretary of the Horticultural Society of London. His employment came to an abrupt end with the death of Banks a few months later. One of Banks\u2019 friends, a wealthy merchant called William Cattley, paid Lindley to draw and describe new plants in his garden at Barnet. He also paid for the publication of  \u201cDigitalia Monographia\u201d. (Later Lindley honoured him by naming the orchid genus Cattleya after him.) In 1820, at the age of twenty-one, Lindley was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London.Stearn, 20", "The Secretary of the Horticultural Society of London at that time was Joseph Sabine and he authorised expenditure on large projects beyond the Society's means. Lindley could only expostulate and was unsuccessful in moderating his actions. By 1830, the Society had mounting debts and a committee of enquiry was set up. Sabine resigned as Secretary and Lindley successfully defended his own position and carried the Society forward with the new Honorary Secretary, George Bentham.Fletcher, H. R.

By 1823 he was a Fellow of the Horticultural Society where he read a paper on the Woburn perennial kale.Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London (1824), 297 On 26 March 1824 he became a fellow of the Linnean Society, having been elected by Joseph Sabine and the Duke of Bedford. In 1822 the Duke of Bedford had begun a comprehensive collection of exotic and indigenous heaths as a way of recuperating from a very severe illness. In his Introduction to Hortus ericaeus Woburnensis which was published in February 1825Duke of Bedford & Sinclair, G. 1825 Hortus ericaeus Woburnensis the Duke states that the collection was completed under the superintendence of his former gardener, George Sinclair. In Hortus Woburnensis,Forbes, J. 1833 Hortus Woburnensis, 240 written later by Sinclair's successor James Forbes, the design of the heath parterres at Woburn is also attributed to Sinclair, and in a letter to the Duke, Sir George Hayter, who did the illustrations for Hortus ericaeus, made reference to Sinclair as having shown him around the greenhouse and parterres and selecting the specimens to be illustrated. To find the best possible growing conditions for the collection of heaths Sinclair began collecting different types of heath soils and analysing their constituents. After several years of systematic investigation he concluded that they were made up mainly of humus, which derived from decayed leaves, and sand. He also collected calcareous soils from around Luton and Dunstable and experimented in mixing them with various proportions of peat and ashes to try to find a potting medium suitable for the more exotic specimens of heaths. However, this proved unsuccessful, and in Hortus ericaeus \u2026 he recommended a natural heath soil for the growing of different species. By now Sinclair's brother, John, was working at Loddiges of Hackney where experimental work was being carried out in growing exotic species and in hybridisation. Sinclair purchased some of the Erica in the Woburn collection from here as well as personally collecting specimens from nurseries at Tooting (possibly William Rollison's Springfield Nursery), New Cross, Fulham, Woking, from George Whitworth of Acre House at Claxby by Normanby in Lincolnshire, and the Vineyard Nursery at Hammersmith, owned by James Lee and Lewis Kennedy. He also travelled to Southampton, where he bought hardy heaths from William Bridgewater Page, and to Bristol, where he made purchases of Cape Heaths from John Miller."]}, {"page": "Paeonia clusii", "response": ["In 1824, Joseph Sabine describes Paeonia cretica based on a specimen from the University of Oxford Botanic Garden, which later turned out to be synonymous to Paeonia arietina (named in 1818), and this plant probably originated from mainland Turkey, not from Crete. Another specimen, now from Crete, was described as P. cretica in 1828 by Tausch, but at that moment the name was no longer available, and hence invalid. Stern proposed P. clusii to replace Tausch's name. Stearn, in 1941, distinguished the population on Rhodes as a separate species and named it P. rhodia. Tzanoudakis however, points out it only differs in the number and shape of the leaf segments, and thus regards it as a subspecies of P. clusii. cited on "]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|Joseph Sabine||07/11/1799||1770 \u2013 24 January 1837"]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Joseph Sabine (1770\u20131837), botanist and horticulturist"]}, {"page": "Sab.", "response": ["#redirect Joseph Sabine"]}, {"page": "Sabine (surname)", "response": ["* Joseph Sabine (1770\u20131837), English lawyer and naturalist", "* Joseph Sabine (British Army officer) (c. 1661\u20131739), British general and Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (S)", "response": ["* Sabine \u2013 Joseph Sabine (1770\u20131837)"]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* Joseph Sabine FRS (1770\u20131837)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1799", "response": ["* Joseph Sabine (1770\u20131837), barrister"]}, {"page": "Sabine, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Sabine"]}, {"page": "Pentadesma butyracea", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sabine"]}]}}
