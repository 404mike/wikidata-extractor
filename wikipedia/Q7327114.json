His moment of fame came on 8 May 1999, in the final match of the 1998\u201399 Third Division season against Plymouth Argyle, which Carlisle needed to win to avoid relegation. With the score 1\u20131 with only ten seconds remaining, and Carlisle winning a corner, Glass came up from his own penalty area and promptly scored a last minute goal, volleying the ball in after the Plymouth goalkeeper had parried out Scott Dobie's goalbound header. Carlisle got the win they needed and Scarborough were relegated to the Football Conference instead after a 1\u20131 draw with Peterborough. Scarborough's match had already finished before Glass scored, and their fans had already been celebrating on the pitch at the McCain Stadium."]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Richard Knight", "|Richard Knight"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|Richard Knight"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|29||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Richard Knight"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["| 4 August 1999 || Richard Knight || Derby County || Two months", "!scope=\"row\"|Richard Knight*"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Richard Knight"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|29||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Richard Knight"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Richard Knight"]}, {"page": "Richard Knight", "response": ["Richard Knight may refer to:", "*Richard Knight (MP) (by 1518\u20131555 or later), English MP for Chichester", "*Sir Richard Knight (1639\u20131679) , English MP for Lymington", "*Richard Knight (footballer) (born 1979), English footballer", "*Richard Knight (1659\u20131745), of Downton, Herefordshire, ironmaster", "*Richard Knight (cricketer) (1892\u20131960), English cricketer", "*Richard Knight (rower) (born 1928), British Olympic rower", "*Richard Knight (art dealer), former Director of Colnaghi and Christie's", "*Richard Knight (speedway rider) (born 1959), former motorcycle speedway rider"]}, {"page": "Charlie Burns (footballer)", "response": ["In September 2014, Burns moved to Cambridge City on a month's loan as cover for the injured Zac Barrett and Richard Knight."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|1||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Richard Knight"]}]}}
