The public will rightly be asking what's next on Mr Souter's shopping list?\" Salmond denied any wrongdoing in the matter and referred himself for investigation after calls for a probe by Scottish MP Jim Sheridan.

An online column by Daniel Gross labelled Goodwin \"The World's Worst Banker\", a phrase repeated elsewhere in the media.
