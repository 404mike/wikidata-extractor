She started acting professionally at the age of 23. She married actor Garth Adams in 1950, and was so until his death in 1977 - they had three children.Bradley's most famous role was as wheelchair-using pensioner Maud Grimes in Coronation Street in old age, from 1993 to 1999. The character was sometimes called \"the mother-in-law from hell\". She filmed 476 episodes during this time, and died suddenly in France a year after leaving the show.\nShe has also made TV appearances in London's Burning, The Bill, Casualty, Bad Girls and The Sweeney. Her film roles included Four Dimensions of Greta and The Flesh and Blood Show (both 1972) with director Pete Walker, and as the old woman who encounters a naked David Naughton at London Zoo in An American Werewolf in London (1981).\nShe was also a successful theatre actress, obtaining an Olivier Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role in a National Theatre production of Billy Liar.Bradley died after suffering a stroke, at the age of 78.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coronation Street", "response": ["New characters Des (Philip Middlemiss) and Steph Barnes (Amelia Bullmore) moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as Yuppies.Little.
