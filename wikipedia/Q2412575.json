Playing at full-back for City was the 38-year-old Sam Barkas, a former England international near the end of his last season. Ramsey was greatly impressed by Barkas's positional sense and accurate passing, and adopted him as a role model. The following season, 1947\u201348, Ramsey firmly established himself ahead of Ellerington in the Southampton team, and was the only player at the club to appear in all 42 League matches."]}, {"page": "Bradford City A.F.C.", "response": ["*  Sam Barkas"]}, {"page": "Joe Fagan", "response": ["When league football resumed after the war, Fagan hoped to establish himself as a regular member of the Manchester City side. The team were then in the Football League Second Division. Managed by Wilf Wild, City were promotion favourites, especially as they included notable pre-war players like captain Sam Barkas, goalkeeper Frank Swift and inside forward Alex Herd. They got off to a winning start but in November there was a change of manager and Sam Cowan, City's pre-war captain, took over. Cowan was an innovator keen to make changes and one of these, on 1 January 1947 against Fulham at Maine Road, was to give Joe Fagan his official Manchester City debut more than eight years after he had joined the club. Fagan was then 25 and he played at right-half, making a creditable performance as City won 4\u20130.Fagan & Platt, p. 18. He played a key role in City's 1946\u201347 Second Division Championship-winning team and went on to make 121 consecutive league appearances from debut until November 1949.Matthews, p. 60. Tony Matthews recorded views of Fagan's \"solid worth\" to City in terms of his \"positional judgment, strong headwork (sic) and general reliability\"."]}, {"page": "Eric Brook", "response": ["In the 1934\u201335 football season Brook scored 17 goals and City finished fourth in the league, ten points behind champions Arsenal. Brook scored a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Arsenal in February that season. Billy Meredith stated that 'never has a goal at Maine-road been greeted with more enthusiasm than that which marked Eric Brook's equalising point ten minutes from the finish or a vigorous 1-1 game with the Arsenal'. In the following season, Brook was Manchester City's top scorer with 13 goals. In a 3-0 victory against Sheffield Wednesday in November that season, one journalist commented that 'Brook took on the role of roving forward with a demoralising effect on the Wednesday defence'. Matt Busby and Sam Cowan had left the City team in this season but Sam Barkas had been brought in from Bradford City. City's forwards had had an unsuccessful season and the team finished ninth in the league. Peter Doherty was bought from Blackpool to address the lack of goals, for a then-club record of \u00a310,000. Doherty had an immediate impact on the team. Doherty scored two goals and Brook scored a hat-trick as City defeated Bolton Wanderers 7\u20130 in March of that season.", "In the 1938 British Home Championship Brook played alongside City teammate Sam Barkas in a 5\u20131 victory over Ireland. Brook's goal in the 75th minute was to be the last for his national team. One journalist stated that Brook was 'elusive and full of energy' within the game and that 'his roving commission frequently misleads defences'. Brook made his final appearance for England in a 2\u20131 victory over Wales in which his perfect pass set up Willie Hall to score the winning goal. One Scottish journalist, who attended the game, described Brook's performance in the game as 'brilliant'. England won the championship that season. Brook was called up to play for England in a game against Czechoslovakia in December 1937, which England won 5\u20134, but withdrew due to peritonitis and was replaced by West Ham's Jackie Morton. Czechoslovakia's football officials expressed regret that Brook was not able to play. Similarly, Brook was selected to play for England in a game against Scotland in April 1939, which England won 2\u20131, but withdrew due to a groin injury (which he sustained playing for City against Bury) and was replaced by Huddersfield Town's Pat Beasley. One journalist was not surprised by Brook's recall to the England team in 1939, stating that 'I have seen all the English forwards lately, and he was the best of the lot'.", "In April 1939, Brook was selected to play for the FA XI on a tour in South Africa. Brook, like his City teammate Frank Swift, was selected to represent England in wartime internationals. Brook won two wartime caps in games against Wales and South Africa in 1939. In the game against South Africa, Brook captained England in a 3\u20130 victory. In the match against Wales, Brook played alongside his Manchester City teammates Frank Swift and Bert Sproston. The England team also included Joe Mercer, who would go on to manage Manchester City in the 1960s. In 1940, Brook was selected to represent England in a wartime international against Scotland. Whilst travelling to the match, he and Sam Barkas were involved in a car crash. Brook suffered a fractured skull. Brook and Barkas were replaced in the England team by Joe Richardson and the Scottish International Tommy Pearson. Brook received \u00a31,625 in compensation for the collision."]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 in English football", "response": ["** - Sam Barkas, 79, was left-back in Manchester City's title winning side of 1937 and was capped five times for England on top of his 176 league appearances for the Maine Road side and a further 202 for his first club Bradford City."]}, {"page": "1989 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 10 December \u2013 Sam Barkas, footballer (born 1910)"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Sam Barkas||  || Full back || 1933\u20131947||196||1|| ||"]}, {"page": "Alec Herd", "response": ["In the 1934\u201335 football season Herd scored 14 goals and City finished fourth in the league, ten points behind champions Arsenal.
