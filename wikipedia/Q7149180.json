Most of us can relate to the idea that if we receive something from someone, we feel almost a need to 'return the favour', and are likely to do so.\" Heightened public awareness of a potential threat is perceived as a 'favour' as it is protecting the public from danger. So the \"UK police forces\u2026use the notion of a favour/fear appeal to offer benefit to citizens and thereby encourage them to report suspicious activity.\" Project Servator's growing prominence in the public mind seeks to enable police to better \"tactically engage with the public, 'by recruiting' them, and by encouraging them to be vigilant and more eager to report suspicious behaviour.\" Professor Baines has spoken about the importance of \"reassurance communications\" by the police as an important aspect of encouraging the public to report suspicious activity.", "The police have used information campaigns to support the deployments. An example of Professor Paul Baines\u2019 psychological approach of reassurance communications, is one of the poster headlines that reads \"We love rush hour, it gives us 300,000 extra pairs of eyes\". Discussing this poster, the magazine of the creative industry, the Drum writes \"It employs public information and deterrence communications techniques. The core emotive colours of red, white and black provoke an emotional response and distinguish the posters \u2013 even in busy environments. And the strapline 'Together, we've got it covered' makes the overall message inclusive while also sending a warning to criminals or malicious individuals.\""]}]}}
