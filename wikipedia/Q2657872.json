He is the sly, somewhat shifty Cockney chef at Fawlty Towers. Though apparently a competent chef (\"I 'ave been to catering school!\"), Terry's cooking methods are somewhat casual, which frustrates and worries the neurotic Basil. He used to work in Dorchester (not at The Dorchester, as a guest wrongly infers). In \"The Anniversary\" Terry and Manuel come to blows since Terry doesn't like anyone else cooking in his kitchen, so he proceeds to sabotage the paella Manuel is making for Sybil, leading to fisticuffs at the end of the episode. Cleese himself told Hall to portray Terry as if he were on the run from the police."]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["Cleese and Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) were supported by Connie Booth (Polly Sherman) and  Andrew Sachs (Manuel) in the two other major roles, with several actors regularly appearing in further supporting roles including Ballard Berkeley (Major Gowen), Brian Hall (Chef Terry), and Renee Roberts (Miss Gatsby) with Gilly Flower (Miss Tibbs).
