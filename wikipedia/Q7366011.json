The raid was to take place just three weeks after Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, and the French had just signed the Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne with Germany on 22 June 1940.Haining (2004), p.116 The newly formed British Commandos were not yet adequately trained and most units were still short of troops. So one of the independent companies which were in the process of being absorbed into the commandos was selected. The unit chosen was No. 11 Independent Company, under the command of Major Ronnie Tod of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. No. 11 Company had been raised after the other Independent Companies on  14 June 1940.
