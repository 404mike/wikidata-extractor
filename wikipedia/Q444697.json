She wrote numerous successful historical romance novels under a form of her maiden name, Marion Chesney, including the \"Travelling Matchmaker\" and \"Daughters of Mannerling\" series.\nUsing the pseudonym M. C. Beaton, she also wrote many popular mystery novels, most notably the Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth mystery series. Both of these book series have been adapted for TV. She also wrote romance novels under the pseudonyms Ann Fairfax, Jennie Tremaine, Helen Crampton, Charlotte Ward, and Sarah Chester.\nWriting as Marion Chesney, her final endeavour was an Edwardian mystery series featuring Lady Rose Summer, a charming debutante with an independent streak, and Captain Harry Cathcart, an impoverished aristocrat. In an interview, she stated that she ceased writing the Edwardian series as a result of the pressure of writing for the Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth series.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["Hamish Macbeth (1995\u20131997) is a series departed from the conventional sitcoms that are mainly filmed in studio and often accompanied by a laugh track.
