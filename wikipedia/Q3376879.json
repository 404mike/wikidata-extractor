These included leading roles in the stage musicals Gypsy, Sweeney Todd, and The King and I, as well as in the hit Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). Moving into television in 1984, she achieved worldwide fame as fictional writer and sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the American whodunit series Murder, She Wrote, which ran for 12 seasons until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running and most popular detective drama series in television history. Through Corymore Productions, a company that she co-owned with her husband Peter Shaw, Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer for the final four seasons. She also moved into voice work, thereby contributing to animated films like Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Don Bluth's Anastasia (1997). Since then, she has toured in a variety of international productions and continued to make occasional film appearances.", "Lansbury has been married twice, first to the actor Richard Cromwell, when she was 19 and Cromwell was 35. Cromwell and Lansbury eloped and were married in a small civil ceremony on September 27, 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946, but they remained friends until his death in 1960. In 1949, she married actor and producer Peter Shaw, and they remained together for 54 years until his death in 2003. She acquired a step-son, David, from Shaw's first marriage. They had two children of their own, Anthony Peter (b. 1952) and Deirdre Ann (b. 1953). While Lansbury repeatedly stated that she wanted to put her children before her career, she admitted that she often had to leave them in California for long periods when she was working elsewhere. She brought up her children to be Episcopalian, although they were not members of a congregation. She has stated that \"I believe that God is within all of us, that we are perfect, precious beings, and that we have to put our faith and trust in that.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Shaw", "response": ["Peter Shaw may refer to:", "* Peter Shaw (physician) (1694\u20131763), English physician and medical author", "* Peter Shaw (producer, born 1918) (1918\u20132003), British actor and film producer, husband of actress Angela Lansbury", "* Peter Shaw (producer, born 1942) (born 1942), British film producer", "* Peter Shaw (footballer) (born 1956), English footballer active during the 1980s", "* Peter Shaw (American actor) (born 1966), American film and television actor", "* Peter Shaw (bowls) (born 1954), New Zealand lawn bowler"]}, {"page": "Hollywood marriage", "response": ["|Angela Lansbury and Peter Shaw"]}, {"page": "Corymore Productions", "response": ["Corymore Productions is an American television production company that was created and founded in 1987 by producer Peter Shaw, the late husband of actress Angela Lansbury.Lansbury Production Company Signs Deal With Universal at The Morning Call", "Shaw launched Corymore Productions at Universal Studios with his two sons, David and Anthony, where for twelve years they co-produced the long-running hit television series Murder, She Wrote, as well as several television movies featuring Lansbury.Obituary: Peter Shaw (1918-2003) at PR Newswire The studio, which produced Murder, She Wrote: The Celtic Riddle lately, hasn't produced anything since 2003."]}, {"page": "Conna", "response": ["In 1970, actress Angela Lansbury and her husband Peter Shaw moved to a farmhouse, named Knockmourne Glebe and originally constructed in the 1820s, that was located near Conna."]}, {"page": "The Exile (1947 film)", "response": ["* Peter Shaw as Higson"]}, {"page": "Sons of the Sea (film)", "response": ["* Peter Shaw as John Strepte"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2003", "response": ["*Peter Shaw, 84, British actor and producer; husband of Angela Lansbury."]}, {"page": "Peter Shaw (producer, born 1942)", "response": ["Peter Shaw (born 6 November 1942) is a British film producer, known for Champions, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, The Water Babies, The Will to Work, and Enigma."]}, {"page": "Peter Shaw (English actor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Shaw (producer, born 1918)"]}]}}
