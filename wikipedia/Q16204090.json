The show features actors Sarah Hadland, Tom Ellis, Patricia Hodge, Sally Phillips, James Holmes and Bo Poraj. It was taped in front of live audiences at the BBC Television Centre and The London Studios.", "The episodes revolve around the difficulties Miranda (Miranda Hart) gets herself into. She is  tall and, sometimes mistaken for a man, is addressed as 'Sir'. She has never fitted in with her old boarding school friends, Tilly (Sally Phillips) and Fanny (Katy Wix), and finds social situations awkward, especially around men. She is a constant disappointment to her mother, Penny (Patricia Hodge), who is desperate for her to get a proper job and a husband. Although Miranda owns and lives above her own joke shop and boutique, she lacks any real capacity for business, so it is managed by her childhood friend Stevie Sutton (Sarah Hadland). The restaurant next door is initially run by Clive Evans (James Holmes), until series three, when the restaurant's chef, Gary Preston (Tom Ellis), purchases it from him. After many failed attempts at dating, Miranda and Gary, a friend from university whom Miranda fancies, decide to be just friends. Nevertheless, when Gary gets a girlfriend called Rose (Naomi Bentley), it prompts Miranda to start a new relationship with Michael Jackford (Bo Poraj), a local reporter whose work soon takes him to Africa. Upon his return he proposes to Miranda, as does Gary when he realises his love for her.

Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote: \"Russell Bolam's production camouflages this through its phenomenal energy and Jean Chan's design skilfully shows the havoc created by the apartment's space invaders. Ifan Meredith's Ivan, first seen arguing with and then desperately kissing a taxi-ordering machine, also conveys the difficulty of leading a rational life in an irrational universe. And there is lively support from Bo Poraj as a manically egotistical academic, Jonathan Rhodes as a buccaneering dealer in stolen goods and Rhona Croker who invests Ivan's redemptive lover with a nice sense of erotic mischief. I'm not sure how closely the play relates, as Butcher suggests, to our own mad world. But Stratiev, who died in 2000, emerges as a fascinating writer who realised that comedy is ultimately the best weapon for subverting state power\"."]}, {"page": "Gloria (play)", "response": ["|Bo Poraj"]}, {"page": "Bohdan Poraj-Pstrokonski", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bo Poraj"]}]}}
