A recognized expert on the art of the Renaissance, he was lauded for his evaluation of claims of authenticity for works from that period, correctly debunking Wilhelm von Bode's assertion that a bust of Flora was sculpted by Leonardo da Vinci. During World War I, Konody became interested in the representation of war in the arts, and directed an effort to commemorate Canadian participation in that war.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Filippino Lippi", "response": ["Because of Lippi's fame and reputation, on the day of his burial all the workshops of the city closed for him.

Konody also found the painting to have features \"far more pleasing and beautiful than in the Louvre version\". A number of Italian experts in the 1920s echoed Konody's assessment of authorship by Leonardo at a time when the painting was more broadly examined. Much later authorities have made varying characterizations of the degree to which the painting can be ascribed to Leonardo; in 2012, The Guardian described the art world as being \"split\" over the question, and in 2013, Reuters said that it was \"dismissed by some experts\", but \"also won support in the art world\". Art historian Jean-Pierre Isbouts has endorsed Leonardo's involvement in painting the work, asserting that \"24 of 27 recognised Leonardo scholars have agreed this is a Leonardo\", while art historian Martin Kemp dismisses the proposition that Leonardo painted any part, and in 2012 described his contemporaries in the art world as being equivocal, or making \"encouraging but noncommittal statements\" on this point.: \"The role-call of significant contemporary Leonardo specialists who openly and unequivocally supported the attribution in public was precisely zero. Alessandro Vezzosi, who spoke at the launch in Geneva, and Carlo Pedretti, the great Leonardo specialist, made encouraging but noncommittal statements about the picture being of high quality and worthy of further research\".: \"Even as Leonardo was perfecting the Mona Lisa, his followers and some of his students were making copies, perhaps with an occasional helping hand from the master. Some are very good, including those known as the Verono Mona Lisa and the Isleworth Mona Lisa, prompting claims that they may have been painted wholly or mostly by Leonardo, though most academic experts are skeptical\".: In Marini's checklist, which he describes as: \"Listed here are all paintings considered autograph works of Leonardo and works attributed to other artists in which it is possible to identify Leonardo's hand\" the painting does not appear.: In Z\u00f6llner's catalogue, that he describes as: \"The following catalogue raisonn\u00e9 contains the cartoons and paintings by Leonardo da Vinci's own hand, a number of early copies of his lost paintings and cartoons, together with more contentious attributions, insofar as these are rationally justified\" the painting does not appear.: \"Other copies of the Mona Lisa include the so-called Isleworth Mona Lisa, which some commentators asserted was Leonardo's first version of the famed portrait. The claim was a controversial one, with several leading Leonardo scholars flatly denying it\".", "Towards the beginning of 1914, Hungarian-born London art critic and historian Paul George Konody examined the painting, and concluded that, unlike Wilhelm von Bode's bust of Flora (which Konody had correctly discerned was falsely claimed as Leonardo),\"Showing Swindlers in the World of Art Never Lack Victims\", New York Herald (22 June 1919), p. 72. the painting was in fact by Leonardo. Konody wrote that the reception of the painting had been marred by \"some press agent who sent out the news broadcast, with wrong statements, misquotations, and other blunders galore\", but nonetheless found that \"though not altogether from the hand of Leonardo da Vinci himself, it emanates most certainly from his studio and was very largely worked up by the master himself\". Blaker's step-father, John R. Eyre, published a monograph in 1915 that suggested a partial attribution to Leonardo.: \"In 1915 his stepfather John R. Eyre, an art historian, published a book suggesting that Leonardo painted two versions of the Mona Lisa and claiming that at least the bust, the face and the hands of the Isleworth lady were a genuine work by Leonardo Da Vinci \u2013- basically, a prequel to his famous portrait\". Eyre cited Konody's evaluation defending the authenticity of the Isleworth Mona Lisa as the motivation for his monograph, \"when this opinion was endorsed by an art critic of Mr. P. G. Konody's standing, I felt convinced there was at least good ground for investigation\".: Preface In this monograph Eyre was the first to formally propose the painting as an earlier version of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre.: \"It was Eyre who first formulated the idea that the Isleworth version preceded that in the Louvre...\" Kemp notes of Eyre that \"His little book of fifty-one pages is full of careful scholarship, and makes about as good a case as can be made\"."]}, {"page": "Adrian Stokes (critic)", "response": ["Stokes evolved an innovative aesthetic in the first two of his major books of the 1930s - The Quattro Cento (1932) and Stones of Rimini (1934).

The stone\u2014deeply respected as a medium \u2013 is, he said, 'carved to flower' thereby bringing to the surface the fantasies the artist reads in its depths.

This exhibition \u2013 from which two paintings the Salom\u00e9 and The Nights of Eve were initially removed, - was a triumph for the artist: eighteen paintings in the show stayed in England after the exhibition.There were over 17,000 paying visitors in the first three weeks, although according to The Daily Chronicle newspaper, in a report on 26 May 1934 of the RWS show of that year, there were twenty-five thousand in total before it closed, and more than 11,000 catalogues were sold. Despite his evident admiration for the artist, Konody avoided being slavish in his praise. While he complimented the artist on his romantic sensibility and his brilliant use of colour, he was critical of the occasional contradictions in his drawing. Beltran Masses had a second large scale exhibition in London in the galleries of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1934, but his last public exhibition in London at the New Burlington Galleries in 1938, did not have the same success."]}, {"page": "Richard Cockle Lucas", "response": ["Despite this evidence, Bode continued to claim that his original attribution was correct.

Various claims and counter-claims have been put forward about the bust, from its being an outright forgery to being a genuine 16th-century piece (albeit not by Leonardo). In April 2021, the bust was dated using carbon-14, which confirmed that it was sculpted in the 19th century.

He created a series of religious and biblical images that he placed within the Sussex landscape. There were three paintings with the theme of the Mother of God and Christ in the period 1907 to 1917 including Two Mothers (1909) where he depicts a mother with two children.
