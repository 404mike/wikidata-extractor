By 1915, the London Directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators, of which 10 were women. Rhoda and Agnes Garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874. The importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of William Morris. In 1876, their work \u2013 Suggestions for House Decoration in Painting, Woodwork and Furniture \u2013 spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience."]}, {"page": "Knightshayes Court", "response": ["Sir John Heathcoat-Amory, 1st Baronet, having purchased the house and estate of Knighshayes in 1867, in the same year commissioned a new replacement house, to the design of William Burges, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1869. The building was complete by 1874, although not to Burges' original designs, and work had begun on the interior. Unlike Burges' partnership with John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, the relationship between architect and client was not successful, Sir John objecting to Burges' designs both on grounds of cost and style. As Crook (1981) commented, \"Heathcoat-Amory built a house he could not afford to decorate, by an architect whose speciality was interior design\".  The disagreement led to the dismissal of  Burges in 1874 and his replacement by John Dibblee Crace.

By 1874, the building was still incomplete, owing to ongoing difficulties with Heathcoat-Amory, who objected to many of Burges's designs on the grounds of cost and of style. Although work had begun on the interior, the turbulent relationship between architect and client led to Burges's sacking in 1874 and his replacement by John Dibblee Crace. Nevertheless, Knightshayes Court remains the only example of a medium-sized Burges country house, built in a standard Victorian arrangement. Early French Gothic in style, it follows a standard neo-Tudor plan of a large central block with projecting gables. The tower Burges planned was never built."]}, {"page": "1919 in art", "response": ["* November 18 \u2013 John Dibblee Crace, British interior decorator (b. 1838)"]}, {"page": "Crace", "response": ["* John Dibblee Crace (1838\u20131919), English interior designer and author, eldest son of John Gregory Crace"]}, {"page": "John Crace", "response": ["*John Dibblee Crace (1838\u20131919), British interior designer "]}, {"page": "Leeds Town Hall", "response": ["Inside the Victoria Hall, a gallery was added in 1874 and then replaced in 1890 by the current design by W.

In 1905, a memorial to Queen Victoria by George Frampton was unveiled in Victoria Square to the south front, replacing a fountain, while the number of windows on the Calverley Street and Victoria Square corner was increased from three to five. In 1907, a new grand stair was built down to the basement. During the 1930s, original fittings, including a gallery designed by Brodrick, were lost in an enlargement of the classical Council Chamber. Victoria Square was altered again in 1937 with the removal of three statues, of Victoria, Robert Peel, and the Duke of Wellington, to Woodhouse Moor one mile from the city centre.
