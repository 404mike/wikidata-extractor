Charlotte has trouble as the shoot involves being covered in fish; which she hates, however it is her photo that is selected. Areilla has problems with Perou's next assignment in Iceland as it requires her to wear nothing but her underwear and a faux fur coat. Although she goes ahead with it Perou is unimpressed with the results and decides he does not want to work with her anymore. He is impressed with Charlotte but decides to select BB's picture. Following this he has Jay, Ocean and Jesse take part in his woodland shoot. He admits that he enjoys working with Jay who does well but ultimately he chooses Ocean's picture for the exhibition.
