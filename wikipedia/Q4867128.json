In June 1938, Pretty took him to the site, offered him accommodation and a wage of 30 shillings a week, and suggested that he start digging at Mound\u00a01. Because it had been disturbed by earlier grave diggers, Brown, in consultation with the Ipswich Museum, decided instead to open three smaller mounds (2, 3 and 4). These only revealed fragmented artefacts, as the mounds had been robbed of valuable items. In Mound\u00a02 he found iron ship-rivets and a disturbed chamber burial that contained unusual fragments of metal and glass artefacts. At first, it was undecided as to whether they were Early Anglo-Saxon or Viking objects.

Hence the true story of the excavation of Mound 2 is suppressed, and the preparations for the 1939 excavation omitted. Some glassware found in Mound 2 is, in the novel, transposed to Mound 1 (e.g. p. 61).Bruce-Mitford 1975, p. 117.
