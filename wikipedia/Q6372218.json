The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall \u00e1 Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on R\u00f9m by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison\u2014discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands.Sabbagh, Karl (1999) Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as sundew, butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.Ball.

Among them is Karl Sabbagh, who asserts the latter view in his book Palestine: A Personal History, which was widely reviewed in the British press in 2010. Zahir was gradually integrated into Palestinian historiography. In Murad Mustafa Dabbagh's Biladuna Filastin (1965), a multi-volume work about Palestine's history, Zahir is referred to as the \"greatest Palestinian appearing in the eighteenth century\". The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) radio station, Voice of Palestine, broadcast a series about Zahir in 1966, praising him as a Palestinian national hero who fought against Ottoman imperialism. Zahir is considered by many Arab nationalists as a pioneer of Arab liberation from foreign occupation. According to Joudah, However historians may look at Shaykh Zahir al-'Umar and his movement, he is highly respected by the Arabs of the East. In particular the Palestinians consider him a national hero who struggled against Ottoman authority for the welfare of his people. This praise is reflected in the recent academic, cultural and literary renaissance within Palestinian society that has elevated Zahir and his legacy to near-iconic status. These re-readings are not always bound to historical objectivity but are largely inspired by the ongoing consequences of the Nakba. Still it is precise to say that Shaykh Zahir had successfully established an autonomous state, or a \"little Kingdom,\" as Albert Hourani called it, in most of Palestine for over a quarter of a century."]}, {"page": "Kamran Abbasi", "response": ["In October 2004, while he was acting editor of the BMJ, Abbasi became the recipient of an unusually large number of responses to a BMJ article written by Derek Summerfield, who published his personal view over what he saw as organised violations of the fourth Geneva Convention by the Israeli army in Gaza and their effects on public health. The reaction to that article was later analysed by Karl Sabbagh and revealed the hostility that editors can receive when publishing on a sensitive issue. In response to the messages sent to the journal's website and the over 1000 emails sent directly to Abbasi, a sample number were published on-line within 24 hours of submission. Sabbagh explained that the published messages \"were a skewed sample of what had been received, as abusive and obscene contributions were not posted\", In response to these messages, many of which \"abused the BMJ or Abbasi personally\", Abbasi published an editorial entitled: \u201cShould journals mix medicine and politics?\u201d Abbasi noted that the messages were \"largely biased and inflammatory on both sides\" and that a number of people felt that dialogue could resolve the conflict. He specified that \u201cin a state of conflict [those] views will be sometime abrasive and unpalatable\" and argued that medicine cannot exist in a political void."]}, {"page": "Brian Inglis", "response": ["Michael McVaugh positively reviewed Inglis's book Natural and Supernatural (1977) describing it as a \"thoroughly serious study\" and the reader \"will acquire an excellent understanding of the frame of mind of the informed psychical researcher in the early twentieth century.\"Michael McVaugh.

In an analysis of the responses published in the journal, Karl Sabbagh concluded that the correspondence was orchestrated by Honest Reporting and aimed at silencing legitimate criticism of Israel. In his analysis Sabbagh pointed to evidence that the correspondents had not read the article. Sabbagh also documented a significant proportion of offensive, abusive and racist insults among the correspondence. An editorial by the BMJ referred to the campaign as bullying and said that the best way to counter such behaviour was to expose it to public scrutiny. Daniel Finkelstein, associate editor of The Times, responded that Sabbagh's piece was \"anti-Israel propaganda\" that did not meet even \"basic academic standards\" of scientific analysis."]}, {"page": "Clapham College", "response": ["* Karl Sabbagh - Palestinian-British writer, journalist and television producer"]}, {"page": "The Body in Question", "response": ["* Executive Producer: Karl Sabbagh"]}, {"page": "List of books about skepticism", "response": ["| Buckman, Robert; Karl Sabbagh"]}, {"page": "William Zeckendorf Jr.", "response": ["In 1989, Zeckendorf finished construction of Worldwide Plaza, on Eighth Avenue between West 49th and 50th Street.
