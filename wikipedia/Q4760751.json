His Torquay debut came on the first day of the 1997\u201398 season, a 2\u20131 defeat away to newly promoted Conference champions Macclesfield Town. That season saw Gibbs score seven goals in 41 league games en route to the Division Three play-offs and ultimately defeat in the final at Wembley against Colchester. In just that one season his wing-back partnership with Andy Gurney resulted in 16 goals between the two of them. Gibbs followed departing Torquay manager Kevin Hodges to Plymouth Argyle on 26 July 1998 thanks to the Bosman ruling, though his then girlfriend Helen Chamberlain of Sky Sports' Soccer AM fame refused to follow suit and stayed loyal to the Gulls. His Plymouth career started successfully enough, being named in the Division Three team for the 1998\u201399 season. However, on the final day of the season, Gibbs suffered a broken leg, putting paid to a planned move to Brentford. Incidentally, the same game in which he broke his leg was the famous Jimmy Glass game against Carlisle, in which the goalkeeper scored in the 94th minute to keep Carlisle United in the Football League."]}, {"page": "1995 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||3 ||Andy Gurney"]}, {"page": "2008 FAW Premier Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||7 || Andy Gurney"]}, {"page": "Bristol Rovers F.C.\u2013Swindon Town F.C. rivalry", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Andy Gurney||style=\"text-align:left;\"|||1992\u20131997||108||9||2001\u201320042005\u20132006||160||23"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Andy Gurney", "|30 June 2001||DF||||Andy Gurney||Swindon Town||21 June 2001", "|rowspan=\"8\"|11||DF||||18||Andy Gurney||1||0||0||0||0||1", "|18||||DF||Andy Gurney||5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Andy Gurney", "|rowspan=\"2\"|9 ||DF||||18||Andy Gurney||2||0||0||0||2", "|18||||DF||Andy Gurney||8||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||9||0"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Andy Gurney", "| Andy Gurney"]}, {"page": "1998 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["The match kicked off around 7.45p.m. on 22 May 1998 in front of 19,486 supporters.

Midway through the first half, Steve Forbes tried to lift the ball over Torquay's Gittens but the ball struck the defender's arm and the referee awarded a penalty.

Soon after the interval Simon Betts struck a shot from around  which went under Gregg's body and wide of the post.  Forbes was then prevented from shooting when he was tackled after beating three defenders.  Torquay began to dominate once again although Colchester were denied a penalty after Gibbs had brought down David Gregory.  Torquay then missed numerous chances to score:  a strike from Gibbs was deflected wide, Gittens headed the ball over the bar and Jack shot wide.
