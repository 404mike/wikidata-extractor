He lives in Sheffield with his wife Sarah and two children. He is the nephew of Gordon Banks, goalkeeper of the 1966 FIFA World Cup winning England squad.Nick started playing drums aged 14 and was inspired by Paul Cook from the Sex Pistols and Blondie's Clem Burke.In their early years he saw many of Pulp's performances in Sheffield and eventually joined the group in 1986 because \"they were [his] favourite band\".Banks also played drums in a Sheffield-based band called Pollinates.\nSince 2007 he has been managing Banks Pottery, a family-owned business which was previously run by his mother.

Their best-known line-up from their heyday (1992\u20131997) consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Senior (guitar, violin), Candida Doyle (keyboards), Nick Banks (drums, percussion), Steve Mackey (bass) and Mark Webber (guitar, keyboards).", "The fold was short-lived however. Steve Mackey, a regular at their Sheffield and London gigs, was also studying in London and was asked to join the band as a bass player.Sturdy, p. 172. The line-up now consisted of Cocker, Mackey, Senior, Candida Doyle, Nick Banks (drums). In mid-1989, they began recording another album for Fire, this time with a bigger budget and production from Alan Smyth, called Separations. This was a progression of the style of Freaks, with Leonard Cohen-esque ballads on side one and an acid house infused track-listing on side two. The disparate styles can be attributed to Cocker and Mackey's different and changing tastes; Mackey introduced Cocker to house music which led to them both going to raves, while Cocker introduced Mackey to \"Scott Walker and Serge Gainsbourg\".Sturdy, p. 175. Like Freaks, the release of Separations was delayed, to an extent lessening the potential impact. In the meantime, however, in 1991, a 12\" recording, \"My Legendary Girlfriend\", became music periodical NMEs single of the week. Stuart Maconie described it in his review as \"a throbbing ferment of nightclub soul and teen opera\".Sturdy, p. 190.
