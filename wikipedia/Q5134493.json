Although the play grossed nearly $1million in ticket sales during its first week and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with \"self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.\" Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that \"it's almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.\" Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, \"Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain\u2014even if three days of it can seem an eternity.\" In Mike Nichols' biographical drama Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Roberts starred as socialite Joanne Herring, the love interest of Democratic Texas Congressman Charles Wilson, opposite Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman .

Rich found many of Lloyd Webber's songs to be \"cleverly and appropriately\" pastiche, and was impressed with how Lynne and Nunn distinguished each character through personalised movement.

The social statement made by Godspell when it first premiered was a serious one at a time when Christianity in the United States was being pulled in different directions; interest in mainstream Christianity was dwindling, especially among the youth, who wanted to leave the Church but not Christianity. Godspell captured this youthful sentiment that reimagined Jesus as a hippie in a more primitive expression of their faith, relating to Jesus not as an object to venerate but as a companion, which contemporary reviewer Clive Barnes described as a \"perfectly contemporary and perfectly vulgar concept of peace and goodwill to all men\".

Albert Bermel considered Papas's rendering of Medea as a sympathetic woman a triumph of acting.
