By then into his early 30s, he was still in top form, as was noted by an English newspaper: \"Sam Aitken, late of Middlesbrough and Raith Rovers, is playing a great game at centre-half for Ayr United in his native town. He is still fit for First League football, and Raith Rovers have not an abler defender than their old captain.\" However, he was released from Ayr in 1913. In September 1913, the Dundee Courier bemoaned, \"Whatever were Ayr United thinking about when they let Sam Aitken go? His shoes have not been filled.\"Aitken then fought in the First World War, serving with the King's Own Scottish Borderers. His eyesight declined and he was nearly completely blind by May 1924, when the Scottish Football Association council voted to give him \u00a310 in aid (equivalent to \u00a31,000 in 2019). His blindness may have been caused by a war injury, as in early 1925, he was admitted to St Dunstan's nursing home, then at Winfield House in Regent's Park. He died five years later. At the first Ayr F.C. match after his death, the players wore black arm bands and the flag at Somerset Park flew at half-mast in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aitken (surname)", "response": ["* Samuel Aitken, Scottish football player"]}]}}
