For instance, the concept of matter should be interpreted not as an absolute property of nature in itself, but instead of how scientifically-grounded mathematical relations describe how the concept of matter interacts with other properties, whether that be in a broad sense such as the gravitational fields that mass produces or more empirically as how matter interacts with sense systems of the body to produce sensations such as weight. Its aim is to comprise all important aspects of an empirical theory in one formal framework.

Redhead noted one \"significant omission\", relating to Erich Kretschmann's critique of universal covariance, but went on to close the review by writing \"I wholeheartedly recommend anyone interested in the history of modern physics to read Pais's extraordinarily able book\". In a second 1984 review, Martin J. Klein wrote that the book is \"rich and rewarding\" and that it \"is written in a lively and effective style\". Felix Gilbert, in a third 1984 review, wrote that the book is \"both sensitive and thorough\" and that he is \"inclined to regard\" it as Einstein's \"definitive biography\". The book was also reviewed in French the same year by Jean Largeault. Among other 1984 reviews, one stated that it was a \"monumental biography\" and that it \"does full justice to the title, the Science and the Life of Einstein\" that was written with \"tremendous erudition and sensibility\". A 1986 review of the book stated that the \"book, despite its blindspots, shortcomings, and difficulties for the uninitiated reader, will remain an indispensable source for anyone interested\" in Einstein's life."]}]}}
