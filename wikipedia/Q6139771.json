Notable among these are the American-influenced Union Bank building at 110\u201320 St Vincent Street; his 1901\u20131905 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station; and Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde. His lengthy career resulted in a wide range of building types, and, with the assistance of skilled draughtsmen such as Richard M Gunn, he adapted his designs to changing tastes and new architectural materials and technologies.\nMiller moved to Stirling in 1911, at 'Randolphfield', and died there on 28 November 1947.", "link_mentions": {}}}
