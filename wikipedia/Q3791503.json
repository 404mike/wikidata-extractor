The slogan is 'points come later': this brings discussion full circle on this page. The point of view is written up in Peter Johnstone's Stone Spaces, which has been called by a leader in the field of computer science 'a treatise on extensionality'. The extensional is treated in mathematics as ambient\u2014it is not something about which mathematicians really expect to have a theory. Perhaps this is why topos theory has been treated as an oddity; it goes beyond what the traditionally geometric way of thinking allows. The needs of thoroughly intensional theories such as untyped lambda calculus have been met in denotational semantics. Topos theory has long looked like a possible 'master theory' in this area."]}, {"page": "Stone space", "response": ["* Peter Johnstone, Stone Spaces, Cambridge University Press, 1982"]}, {"page": "Peter Johnstone", "response": ["Peter Johnstone may refer to:", "*Peter Johnstone (mathematician) (born 1948), professor of mathematics", "*Peter Johnstone (governor) (born 1944), Governor of Anguilla", "*Peter Johnstone (rugby union) (1922\u20131997), New Zealand rugby union player", "*Peter Johnstone (footballer) (1887\u20131917), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge", "response": ["*Peter Johnstone"]}, {"page": "Whitehead Prize", "response": ["* 1979 Peter Cameron, Peter Johnstone"]}, {"page": "List of people by Erd\u0151s number", "response": ["* Peter Johnstone"]}, {"page": "Timeline of category theory and related mathematics", "response": ["| 2002 || Peter Johnstone ||| Influential book: sketches of an elephant \u2013 a topos theory compendium.
