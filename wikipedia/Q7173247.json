He also added another medal to his collection as Dundalk won the Premier Division title on the last day of the season. Sava signed a new contract for the 2015 season and went on to make three league appearances for the club, keeping two clean sheets, as Dundalk once more won the Premier Division title. In 2016, Sava again found himself second-choice behind Gary Rogers, thus missing out on the chance to appear in their Champions League qualifiers as they reached the play-off round.

All seemed to be going well for the home side after Chris Forrester headed in Ger O'Brien's corner after 43 minutes and Dundalk's Michael Rafter getting sent off in the tunnel at half-time. The Saints peppered Peter Cherrie's goal with shots but just couldn't find that 2nd goal just wouldn't come. Mark Griffn's run from the halfway line won the County Louth side a free kick on the edge of the box and Griffin curled it into the top left corner with his team's first real shot of note. As St.Pat's pushed for the winner, John Mountney caught them on the break and was fouled in exactly the same position as the Lillywhite's goal came from. Griffin fired the set-piece into the bottom right corner to become the hero to the away support. This loss ended the Saints' run of 22 unbeaten league games at Richmond Park.", "Dundalk were Pats' hosts, just 3 days after the disappointing performance against Bray Wanderers. Liam Buckley decided to make 3 changes to the side that lost to Bray, including Barry Murphy in goal instead of number 1 Brendan Clarke. Pats were the better side in the first half, with Jake Carroll, Ger O'Brien, Sean O'Connor and Ryan Coombes all coming close. Dundalk's only shot on target in the first half was wonderfully saved by Murphy. Sean O'Connor struck a powerful shot with his weaker right foot past Peter Cherrie after 57 minutes, following a good ball by Chris Forrester. Murphy made one more impressive save and the Saints got their 1\u20130 victory after a dominant performance.", "Pats fans traveled in big numbers up to Dundalk for the semi-final live on RT\u00c9. The Saints started off the better of the two sides and found themselves ahead when Kenny Browne scored his first competitive goal of the season when he volley in Chris Forrester's header from a Ger O'Brien corner. Sean O'Connor nearly doubled the lead from a free-kick but it was tipped over the bar by Peter Cherrie. Greg Bolger was the man to double the lead though when he headed in an O'Connor cross after 52 minutes. Sean O'Connor finally got the goal his performance deserved after 85 minutes when Cherrie was pressured by Christy Fagan into heading the ball right to O'Connor, who passed into an empty net from 25 yards to put the Saints into the final at the Aviva Stadium."]}, {"page": "List of foreign League of Ireland players", "response": ["* Peter Cherrie \u2013 Dundalk, Bray Wanderers, Cork City, Derry City"]}, {"page": "2019 League of Ireland Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||1 || Peter Cherrie"]}, {"page": "2021 League of Ireland Premier Division", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Peter Cherrie"]}]}}
