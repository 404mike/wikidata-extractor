He was rated by Trevor Bailey as the most formidable English batsman without a Test cricket cap.Marner was born in Oldham, Lancashire. An all-rounder, he played for Crompton in the Central Lancashire League aged 15, and made his first-class debut for Lancashire in 1952, aged 16 years and five months, against Sussex at Hove. This made him the youngest person to ever play for Lancashire, beating the record set in 1879 by Johnny Briggs. Powerfully built, he was a hard-hitting right-handed middle-order batsman, right-arm medium-pace seam bowler, and a good slip fielder.\nMarner is also in the record books for being the first person to win a limited-overs Man of the Match award, when Lancashire played its first Gillette Cup match against Leicestershire at Old Trafford in May 1963. He scored the format's maiden century in that game with an innings of 121, and also took 3 wickets for 49 runs.He clashed with the authorities at Lancashire, and moved to Leicestershire after the 1964 season. He toured Pakistan with a Commonwealth XI in 1967, but never played Test cricket. He reached 1,000 first-class runs in 12 seasons, scored 18 centuries, took 360 wickets, and held 379 catches.Marner was also talented in rugby union playing for Oldham and the British Army during a two-year stint of National Service. He also represented the Combined Services in cricket during that period. He suffered a neck injury playing rugby which interrupted his career in both sports in the 1950s.He died in Oldham after a short illness. He was survived by his wife Vera, daughter Sara and son Nick, who was a useful league fast bowler.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Friends Provident Trophy", "response": ["The first match (which was also retrospectively identified as the first List A cricket match after that designation was developed), was a Preliminary Round match on 1 May 1963 at Old Trafford, Manchester with Lancashire facing Leicestershire. The match ended up lasting two days due to rain. Peter Marner scored the first century and Brian Statham was the first bowler to take 5 wickets in a match."]}, {"page": "Roses Match", "response": ["Not to be outdone Fred Trueman was always keen to entertain the crowds, even during one of the slower passages of play. On one occasion, before a packed Old Trafford Roses crowd, he was returning the ball with his party piece left-handed throw from deep mid-wicket when he slipped and fired the ball high over the startled wicket keeper to the third-man boundary. Renowned for his mastery of seam and swing, and ebullient self-confidence, he was once asked by a straight faced Richard Hutton if he'd ever bowled a straight ball. Fred didn't miss a beat \"Aye, I did. It went straight through Peter Marner [of Lancashire] like a streak o'piss and flattened all three.\""]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2007", "response": ["*Peter Marner, 71, British cricketer, youngest player to represent the Lancashire County Cricket Club."]}, {"page": "Bertie Buse", "response": ["Somerset batted first and were all out in around 90 minutes for just 55. Off-spin bowler Roy Tattersall unusually opened the bowling, and took seven for 25. No Somerset batsman reached double figures, and Buse made just five. When Lancashire batted, Buse himself proved almost as deadly, taking four of the first five wickets that fell for just 46 runs. But then Peter Marner and Alan Wharton decided to hit out, and put on a stand of 70 in 25 minutes for the sixth wicket. In all, Lancashire totalled 158, made off just 32 overs, with Buse taking six for 41 and the innings finishing by teatime on the first day. Somerset's second innings then proved no better than the first, with Brian Statham joining Tattersall in the wickets. Only a last-wicket partnership of 35 by Jim Redman and the debutant Brian Langford delayed matters at all. Somerset were all out for 79, losing by an innings and 24 runs, with Tattersall having match figures of 13 wickets for 69 runs. The game was over by six o'clock on the evening of the first day."]}, {"page": "Kevin Griffith", "response": ["He played one more game that season, taking the single wicket of Leicestershire's Peter Marner,"]}, {"page": "Marner", "response": ["* Peter Marner (1936\u20132007), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Ray Julian", "response": ["By the mid-1960s, recruits from other countries brought in by the Leicestershire secretary, later manager, Mike Turner, such as Stanley Jayasinghe and Clive Inman and from other counties such as John Cotton and Peter Marner, helped make Leicestershire a more competitive side. Julian played regularly through to the end of the 1965 season, but for 1966 the 20-year-old Roger Tolchard, a Devonian via Malvern College, was preferred and Julian then became his deputy, appearing in only three further first-class matches to the end of the 1971 season, when he left the county staff.
