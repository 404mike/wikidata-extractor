He made a significant geological discovery in the 1850s when his tenant found fossilized leaves embedded among basalt lava on the Island of Mull. He also helped to popularize ornithology and was one of the first to give a detailed account of the principles of bird flight in the hopes of advancing artificial aerial navigation (i.e. flying machines). His literary output was extensive writing on topics varying from science and theology to economy and politics. In this respect, Argyll can be considered a polymath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1900", "response": ["* April 24 \u2013 George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, British politician (b. 1823)"]}, {"page": "Liberal Unionist Party", "response": ["*George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll"]}, {"page": "1900 in literature", "response": ["*April 30 \u2013 George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, Scottish politician and writer (born 1823)"]}, {"page": "Metaphysical Society", "response": ["*George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll"]}, {"page": "British Science Association", "response": ["* 1855: George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll FRS, FRSE, FGS"]}, {"page": "West Highland White Terrier", "response": ["Other related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers.

Another breed of white Scottish terriers also appeared at this point, with Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman from Fife developing his line of \"Pittenweem Terriers\" out of a female Scottish Terrier which produced white offspring. The dog seemed to produce these white puppies regardless of the sire to which she was bred, and after drowning over 20 of these offspring, he came upon the theory that it was an ancient trait of the Scottish Terrier that was trying to reappear. He re-dedicated his breeding programme to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the same stature as the dark-coloured breed. Flaxman is credited with classes being added to dog shows for white Scottish Terriers towards the end of the 19th century."]}, {"page": "Peelite", "response": ["After the fall of the Aberdeen government, the Peelite faction took most of the blame for their management of the war in the Crimea. The party further lost cohesion with some members including William Ewart Gladstone, Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet and Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea accepting cabinet posts in the new government led by Viscount Palmerston only to resign a few weeks later when the government agreed to hold a commission on the conduct of the recent war. Others stayed, including George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe after which the Peelites with now no agreed overall leader appeared to be a band of independents rather than a political faction. In the 1857 general election, their numbers further decreased to around 26, or maybe less than 20 as identifying who was and who was not a Peelite became increasingly difficult."]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll"]}, {"page": "List of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle", "response": ["|George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll||75px||1823\u20131900||1856||\u00a0"]}]}}
