First Hearne produced drawings specifically for the project, then Byrne produced 10\" x 7\" engravings after them, and descriptions were added in French and English. The works were issued in series for individual sale from 1778. In 1786 the first 52 plates were bound as a book; a second volume of 32 plates was published in 1807.\"Hearne, Thomas\"  The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. Oxford Reference Online By this time an individual print sold for 15s compared to a complete set of the proof impressions for 26l 5s (2011: \u00a3). Many of the drawings were exhibited at a gallery in Spring Gardens, London. During the extensive tour of Britain which the work necessitated, Hearne studied nature with care, investing his topographical drawings with effects of light and atmosphere seldom attempted by previous draughtsmen in watercolour. He may thus be said to have done much to revive attention to Gothic architecture, and to have been one of the founders of the English school of watercolours."]}, {"page": "John Warwick Smith", "response": ["Other books illustrated with engravings after works by Smith include Select Views in Italy (1792\u20136); Views of the Lakes of Cumberland, with twenty aquatints by James Merigot (1791\u20135); William Byrne's Britannia Depicta and William Sotheby's Tour through Wales (1794).
