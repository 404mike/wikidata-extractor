Guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member in their first reunion only.", "The Verve's members sometimes expressed bitter sentiments about the band's later years. In his only interview after the split, McCabe said of Urban Hymns: \"By the time I got my parts in there it's not really a music fan's record. It just sits nicely next to the Oasis record\", though conceding, \"I'm not going to say it was bad. I mean, we were good as far as pop goes\". During his solo career, Ashcroft expressed regret at having asked McCabe to return for the album instead of releasing it under his own name, saying: \"Imagine being the guy that's written an album on his own, bottles it near the end, feels like there's unfinished business, rings Nick McCabe up who adds some guitars, puts it out as the Verve and the same problems arise again. Imagine being that mug. I've now got to rewrite history. Everyone thinks those songs are somehow associated with another bunch of people that I'm not with now\". Jones claimed that \"The Verve were going off in a direction of strings and ballads, and that's not where I was coming from at all. Loud guitars is it for me\", though noting that this was not why the band split up.", "Ashcroft had been adamant that The Verve would not re-form, once remarking: \"You're more likely to get all four Beatles on stage\". However, after Ashcroft learned that Salisbury was in contact with McCabe over a possible side project, Ashcroft contacted McCabe and Jones, making peace with them, and the band re-formed. Tong was not asked to rejoin, so as to keep the internal issues that split the band up a decade ago to an absolute minimum. Jones explained this decision by stating: \"It would have been too hard, it's hard enough for the four of us. If you bring more people to it, it's harder to communicate and communication has always been our difficulty\". Paradoxically, Nick McCabe would state years later on his Twitter account, that he intended to include Davide Rossi (violist) as a new member of the group. On 26 June 2007, the band's reunion was announced by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1. The band, reuniting in their original line-up, announced they would tour in November 2007, and release an album in 2008. The band stated: \"We are getting back together for the joy of music\", though they turned down a multi-album deal offer \"because the 'treadmill' of releasing albums and touring marked the beginning of the end for the band a decade ago\".", "McCabe and Jones have since started their own project, The Black Ships, who later changed their name to Black Submarine, along with electric violinist and arranger Davide Rossi and drummer Mig Schillace. In September 2017, Nick McCabe noted that he had not spoken to Ashcroft for over a year and that a possible reunion would be unlikely in the foreseeable future.
