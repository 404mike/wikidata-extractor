But with the reliable and normally fit Harold Stephenson as the regular Somerset wicketkeeper, and the county not running, until 1956, a regular second eleven, Day went back into Bristol club cricket, where he was a wicketkeeper and opening batsman for Knowle Cricket Club.\nIt was in 1956 that Day reappeared in first-class cricket. Stephenson was injured early in the season and Day played in six consecutive matches across the month of May. His wicketkeeping, said Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, showed \"much ability\" and he also proved capable with the bat. In his first match, he made 43 of the last 58 runs in Somerset's only innings against Leicestershire at Taunton. And the following game, he made an unbeaten 56 out of 85 at Old Trafford against a Lancashire attack that included Brian Statham, Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton.At the end of May, Stephenson returned to the Somerset side and Day did not play first-class cricket again. \"In different circumstances,\" says one directory of Somerset cricketers, \"he could well have established himself at county level. As a batsman he took few risks, scoring more than 30 centuries for Knowle CC as a reward for that diligence.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yatton", "response": ["George Lukins, also known as the Yatton daemoniac, was an individual famous for his alleged demonic possession and the subsequent exorcism that occurred in 1788.
