He was a minister at the Northern Ireland Office from 1992 to 1993, resigning after his support for failed businessman Asil Nadir damaged his reputation. After his long career at Westminster, Mates lost the election for police commissioner in Hampshire in August 2012.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political scandals in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Michael Mates gift of a watch (\"Don't let the bastards grind you down\") to Asil Nadir (1993)"]}, {"page": "June 9", "response": ["*1934 \u2013 Michael Mates, English colonel and politician"]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["During this period Heseltine enjoyed excellent relations with the media: among TV journalists he was in regular touch with Elinor Goodman of Channel 4 News (herself a former Haymarket employee), James Mates of ITN (son of his lieutenant Michael Mates) and John Cole, whilst among print journalists he was close to his old friend Anthony Howard (Deputy Editor of the Observer), Peter Jenkins, and especially close to Anthony Bevins of The Independent and the young Alastair Campbell of the Daily Mirror.Crick 1997, p. 317.", "Heseltine's resignation in January 1986 had been just before the only occasion on which the Poll Tax was discussed in Cabinet. He spoke against the tax when it was enacted into law in 1987\u20131988, but abstained rather than voting against as Edward Heath  did, although he voted for Michael Mates' amendment which tried to introduce an element of banding according to ability to pay. Heseltine remained aloof from factional plotting in the Commons, and voted with the left-wing Lollard faction in backbench committee elections.Crick 1997, pp. 306\u20137. Heseltine later said that he regretted resigning from the Cabinet in 1986, as he subsequently often wondered if he and Nigel Lawson might have been able to persuade Thatcher to abandon the tax.", "Heseltine disappointed many of his supporters by not pushing for them to get jobs in Major's new administration. Ian Grist was sacked from the Welsh Office and Michael Mates was eventually given a Minister of State position after the 1992 election. There were suggestions that Heseltine might be appointed Home Secretary, but Heseltine advertised his lack of interest in the position, and Major insisted that he had not offered it to him. By contrast, his enthusiasm for industrial policy made it impossible for him to be appointed Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the job he most coveted.Crick 1997, p. 362.", "In mid-1995 Major challenged his critics to \"put up or shut up\" by resubmitting himself to a leadership election in which he was unsuccessfully opposed by John Redwood the Secretary of State for Wales. There was speculation that Heseltine's supporters would engineer Major's downfall in the hope that their man would take over, but they stayed loyal to Major. Heseltine had been listening to regular reports about his potential support from his lieutenants Keith Hampson, Richard Ottaway, Michael Mates and Peter Temple-Morris, and in the event of a second ballot hoped to receive Major's endorsement. Peter Tapsell refused to support him because of the European issue. Hampson believed that Heseltine might have won, as did Philip Stephens of the Financial Times. Michael Crick does not agree, pointing out that many of Heseltine's supporters from 1990 had retired from the Commons and the 1992 intake was more right-wing and eurosceptic.Crick 1997, pp. 414\u20137."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Michael Mates", "| Michael Mates"]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Michael Mates"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Michael Mates"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Michael Mates"]}, {"page": "Paul Goodman (politician)", "response": ["In 1977 he worked for a year as a researcher to the Conservative MP at Petersfield, Michael Mates.

Four junior ministers openly backed Heseltine: the Welsh Office ministers Wyn Roberts and Ian Grist, and David Trippier and David Leigh. Heseltine was also endorsed by a number of senior ex-ministers including: Sir Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson, Lord Carrington (who as a peer had no vote), Peter Walker, David Howell, Ian Gilmour, Norman Fowler, Geoffrey Rippon, Jim Prior, Norman St John-Stevas and Paul Channon, but he had less support among younger MPs amongst whom he had done little to canvass support. Heseltine's campaign chairman Michael Mates was away for five days in the Middle East with the Defence Select Committee, of which he was chairman, so Heseltine's campaign did not have the cohesion of Major's, which was run by Norman Lamont.
