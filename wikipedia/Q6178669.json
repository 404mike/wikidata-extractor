The women of G-Wing and the officers alike are disgusted at Natalie's return to Larkhall. The women stand their ground and begin chanting \"Nonce, nonce, nonce...\" at Natalie and promise to give her a hard time. When Natalie confesses to being a pedophile, Frances slaps her, just as Colin Hedges (Tristan Surrock) walks into her office. Following a fight with Al McKenzie (Pauline Campbell), in which Natalie stamps on Al with her high heels after Al brandished a straight razor, Natalie manipulates her into thinking that her boyfriend had actually abused the children. She sets up a plan with Bev Tull (Amanda Barrie) and Phyl Oswyn (Stephanie Beacham) to trap Julie Saunders' (Victoria Alcock) hand in a sewing machine, and make it look like an accident. Natalie saves Julie's hand, badly cutting her own in the process. This, however, wins over the other inmates. After Phyl and Bev make rhubarb hootch, which results in Al dying, Natalie blackmails them and forces them to poison Frances with it; the attempt fails, however. Natalie then does acts of sodomy with fellow prisoner Kris Yates (Jennifer Ness), who is also in a secret same-sex relationship with officer Selena Geeson (Charlotte Lucas). Natalie does her best to split them up, and reports their relationship when Kris rejects her advances and attacks her. Kris is branded a bully and Natalie is released from Cellular Confinement.
