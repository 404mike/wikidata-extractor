This however, rests solely on the appearance of Alan's styles. However, as Matthew Hammond has shown, this is more likely to refer to fact that Alan, as a grandson of M\u00e1el Coluim, Earl of Atholl, probably sought to inherit the province; by 9 January 1234, King Alexander seems to have recognise this style. However, by the time of a charter of 7 July 1235, the style had disappeared and Alan was never called \"count\" (mormaer or earl) again. Alan, like his father Thomas, would also challenge the rights of the mormaers of Mar. Alan was descended from Gille Cr\u00edst, Mormaer of Mar. However, Gille Cr\u00edst's descendants had been excluded from inheritance by the line of Morgg\u00e1n, Mormaer of Mar, who were monopolising the comital title. Alan tried and failed to oust Uilleam from his title. It would be the greatest failure of Alan's career that he failed to rise to comital rank.
