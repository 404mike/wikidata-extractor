Her first notable West End role was Naemi in Jew S\u00fcss in 1929, an extravagantly theatrical production, in which she won praise for the naturalism and truth of her playing.\"Duke of York's Theatre\", The Times, 20 September 1929, p. 12 In the same year she married Rupert Hart-Davis, then an aspiring actor and later a publisher. He later described the marriage as \"a sad failure: we were much too young to know what we wanted\u00a0... after much agony we parted and were duly divorced. Nowadays Peggy and I lunch together perhaps once or twice a year in a Soho restaurant and have a lovely nostalgic-romantic talk of shared memories of long ago. She is a lovely person and the best actress living.\"Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, p. 24"]}, {"page": "Norman Shelley", "response": ["Shelley was born in Chelsea, London, the son of Frank Shelley, a painter, and his wife, Alice Campbell, n\u00e9e Glover.

Noel was considered the \"plain\" sister in her family, but she shone in performances with her sisters for charity. Upon reaching adulthood she sought a career in theatre, and gained ten years of experience as an actress, working for the Charles Doran and Arthur Bourchier companies.  Her familiarity with the stage was the basis for many of her popular books for children, which are often about children struggling with careers in the arts.Bull, Angela, Noel Streatfeild, Collins, 1984.
