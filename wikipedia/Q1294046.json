Barry obtained a medical degree from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, then served first in Cape Town, South Africa, and subsequently in many parts of the British Empire. Before retirement, Barry had risen to the rank of Inspector General (equivalent to Brigadier) in charge of military hospitals, the second highest medical office in the British Army. Barry not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants, and performed the first recorded caesarean section by a European in Africa in which both the mother and child survived the operation.Although Barry's entire adult life was lived as a man, Barry was named Margaret Ann Bulkley at birth and was known as female in childhood. Barry lived as a man in both public and private life, at least in part in order to be accepted as a university student, and to pursue a career as a surgeon. Barry's biological sex became known to the public and to military colleagues only after a post-mortem examination.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson", "response": ["Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (9 June 1836\u00a0\u2013 17 December 1917) was an English physician and suffragist. She was the first woman to qualify in Britain as a physician and surgeon.James Barry, who lived as a man, qualified before her. Frances Hoggan preceded her as the first British woman to qualify in Europe, having qualified in Switzerland. She was the co-founder of the first hospital staffed by women, the first dean of a British medical school, the first woman in Britain to be elected to a school board and, as mayor of Aldeburgh, the first female mayor in Britain.", "In 1865, she finally took her exam and obtained a licence (LSA) from the Society of Apothecaries to practise medicine, the first woman qualified in Britain to do so openly (previously there was Dr James Barry who was born and raised female but presented as male from the age of 20, and lived his adult life as a man). On the day, three out of seven candidates passed the exam, Garrett with the highest marks.Manton, pp. 162\u2013163  The Society of Apothecaries immediately amended its regulations to prevent other women obtaining a licence Manton, p. 176 meaning that Jex-Blake however could not follow this same path; the new rule disallowed privately educated women to be eligible for examination.

In practice, the transfer did not take effect until 24 February 1836 when Major-General George Middlemore (1836\u20131842), the first governor appointed by the British government, arrived with 91st Regiment troops. He summarily dismissed St\u00a0Helena Regiment and, following orders from London, embarked on a savage drive to cut administrative costs, dismissing most officers previously in the Company employ. This triggered the start of a long-term pattern whereby those who could afford to do so tended to leave the island for better fortunes and opportunities elsewhere. The population was to fall gradually from 6,150 in 1817 to less than 4,000 by 1890. Charles Darwin spent six days of observation on the island in 1836 during his return journey on HMS Beagle. Controversial figure, Dr. James Barry, also arrived that year as principal medical officer (1836\u20131837). In addition to reorganising the hospital, Barry highlighted the heavy incidence of venereal diseases in the civilian population, blaming the government for the removal of the St\u00a0Helena Regiment, which resulted in destitute females resorting to prostitution."]}, {"page": "Caesarean section", "response": ["European travellers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.

About the age of seventeen he first attempted oil painting, and between that and the age of twenty-two, when he first went to Dublin, he produced several large pictures, which decorated his father's house, such as Aeneas escaping with his Family from the Flames of Troy, Susanna and the Elders and Daniel in the Lions' Den\".", "*Pressly, William L.
