He was born at Hartlepool, County Durham, and died at Clifton, Bristol.\nHope was a right-handed middle or lower order batsman and an occasional right-arm fast-medium bowler. He was educated at Sherborne School and played Minor Counties cricket for Dorset up to 1913.\nHis first-class cricket for Somerset was restricted largely to three seasons, 1914, 1919 and 1921, though in each of these he was a fairly regular member of the side. In 1914, his one substantial innings was 65 against Derbyshire at Chesterfield. Earlier, by making 18, he had contributed exactly half the runs made from the bat in the second innings against Hampshire at Bath.Hope returned to first-class cricket for a dozen games in 1919 and improved his personal best by scoring 68 in the match against Gloucestershire at Taunton. This was the match in which Sydney Rippon, with whom Hope shared a 99-run first innings partnership that set Somerset on course to victory, played under an assumed name. Hope did not play in 1920, but returned to Somerset for a further dozen games in 1921, when  he again improved his highest score, this time scoring 77, more than double the second highest score, in the match against Essex at Bath.After 1921 Hope left regular first-class cricket, making just one further appearance for Somerset in the 1925 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Phil Hope", "response": ["* Ideas into Action: Handbook on Project Planning for Youth and Community Workers by Philip Hope, 1987, National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, ", "* Making the Break: Choices and Decisions Facing Young People Leaving Home by Philip Hope, 1989, CVS Advisory Service, ", "* Education for Citizenship: Resource Pack for Schools by Philip Hope, 1991, The Children's Society, ", "* View to Learn by Philip Hope and Warren Feek, 1991, ITV and Channel Four Community Education", "* Making Best Use of Consultants by Philip Hope, 1992, Financial Times Prentice Hall, ", "* Diagnosis, Data Collection and Feedback in Consultancy by Philip Hope, 1994, Open University", "* Education for Parenthood: A Resource Pack for Young People by Philip Hope, 1994, The Children's Society, ", "* Analysis and Action on Youth Health by Philip Hope, 1995, Commonwealth Youth Programme", "* Performance Appraisal: A Handbook for Managers in Public Organisations by Philip Hope and Tim Pickles, 1995, Russell House Press, ", "* Tomorrow's Parents: Developing Parenthood Education in Schools by Philip Hope and Penny Sharland, 1997, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, ", "* User Involvement by Philip Hope and Sarah Hargreaves, 1997, Framework in Print", "* Education for Parenthood: A Resource Pack for Young People by Philip Hope, 1998, ", "* Philip Hope (Corby): maiden speech, 14 May 1997, Hansard"]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Philip Hope "]}, {"page": "Hope (surname)", "response": ["*Philip Hope (1889\u20131962), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Philip Hope (1914\u20131925) 41 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Phillip Hope", "response": ["#redirect Philip Hope "]}]}}
