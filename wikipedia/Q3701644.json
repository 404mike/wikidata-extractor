In the late 1860s, he mainly illustrated for the journal, writing the occasional article, attending the great Paris Exhibition of 1867, where the journal writers \"discovered a fund of new technology on which to report\". However, in 1870, on the death of editor Zerah Colburn, he became a co-editor of the journal with William Henry Maw. Maw not only considered Dredge to be a friend, but also his senior in technical matters. As editor of Engineering, Dredge was a surveyor, documenting numerous bridges and photographing them in the 1890s; a notable contribution was his Thames Bridges, from the Tower to the Source (1897). In 1901, he founded a monthly supplement to Engineering, a journal named Traction and Transmission, but it only lasted for three years."]}, {"page": "1896 in Scotland", "response": ["* 22 January \u2013 Daniel Kinnear Clark, mechanical engineer (born 1822)"]}, {"page": "G.
