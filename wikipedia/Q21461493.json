He created sculptures using modern materials such as perspex and resin and considered that Art could be a means of changing society.  His greatest influence was on Art teaching. He was a foremost proponent of the Bauhaus concept of teaching Art and Design by Basic Design, taking that principle to Art Colleges across the UK in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. This came to be the Art foundation course which provide an holistic grounding for Art and Design students before taking higher education qualifications.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Hudson", "response": ["Thomas or Tom Hudson may refer to:", "* Tom Hudson (programmer), American computer programmer", "* Tom Hudson (English actor) (born 1986), English actor", "* Tom Hudson (French actor) (born 1994), French actor", "* Tom Hudson (art educator) (1922\u20131997), British art educationalist", "* Tom Hudson (rugby union) (born 1994), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Cardiff School of Art & Design", "response": ["*Tom Hudson (1922-1997), Director of Studies 1964 -1978 Leading art educationalist and exponent of Basic Design"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 1997", "response": ["*Tom Hudson, 75, British artist and lecturer."]}]}}
