In 1997, he directed several episodes of the British soap opera, Family Affairs as a part of a working holiday in the UK. At one point, he also temporarily parted company with the Reg Grundy production stable to establish his own company, which provided television coverage of major sporting events. Before going behind the camera, he originally worked as an actor and is on record as saying that \"you cannot be a good director unless you have acted yourself\".\nColeman's autobiography, One Door Shuts, was self-published through Trafford Publishing in 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 28", "response": ["*1936 \u2013 Alan Coleman, English-Australian director, producer, and screenwriter (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "December 10", "response": ["*2013 \u2013 Alan Coleman, English-Australian director, producer, and screenwriter (b. 1936)"]}, {"page": "The Young Doctors", "response": ["The series produced by the Grundy Organisation was created and devised by Alan Coleman with Reg Watson acting as Executive Producer.

Masters went on to produce Grundy's replacement medical soap, Starting Out, for Nine, and then Grundy's stablemate, Prisoner, from 1983.", "The most regularly seen set was the large hospital entrance lobby containing a reception desk, refreshments kiosk, a lift and stairs to the upper floors, and swinging double-doors that led into the casualty department. Various wards, offices, theatres and small medicine labs all saw an equal amount of romantic and dramatic action over the years. Alan Coleman revealed on a DVD release of the series that the various 'flats' used as sets were simply re-dressed with different hospital equipment and furniture giving the Albert Memorial a sense of monotony often associated with clinical, hospital environments.", "Actress Joanne Samuel was another fan-favourite as Nurse Jill Gordon. The actress was written out of The Young Doctors by Alan Coleman to allow Samuel the golden opportunity to star in the film Mad Max alongside Mel Gibson in 1979. The film is now widely considered an enduring example of classic Australian cinema."]}, {"page": "Punishment (TV series)", "response": ["The programme created by Reg Watson was produced and directed by Alan Coleman.
