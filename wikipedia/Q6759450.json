She was involved with the production of several volumes of the officially sponsored History of the Second World War, but was better known for her books, commissioned by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, covering the early history of Britain's nuclear weapons programmes: Britain and Atomic Energy 1939\u20131945, published in 1964, and the two-volume Independence and Deterrence: Britain and Atomic Energy 1945\u201352, published in 1974.\nThrough her work in the Cabinet Office from 1945 to 1959, she knew personally many of the people involved. As historian archivist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority from 1959 to 1966 she had access to the official papers and files of the British nuclear weapons programmes.  She was the first occupant of a chair in the history of science at the University of Oxford, which she held from 1972 until her retirement in 1986. As co-founder with physicist Nicholas Kurti of the Contemporary Scientific Archives Centre in Oxford, she helped ensure the preservation of contemporary scientific manuscripts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linacre College, Oxford", "response": ["* Margaret Gowing, , holder of the first chair in the History of Science at Oxford"]}, {"page": "Tube Alloys", "response": ["The research from the MAUD committee was compiled in two reports, commonly known as the MAUD reports in July 1941.

His Survey of British Commonwealth Affairs was published in three volumes in 1937\u201342. In 1941 he was appointed Supervisor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of the History of the Second World War and was thereafter editor of the series.  In 1949, with Margaret Gowing, he wrote  The British War Economy, the introductory volume to that series.  Between 1944 and 1949, he returned to Oxford, becoming Chichele Professor of Economic History.  During the War he also played a role in Civil Defence, serving as a firewatcher.  He was knighted in 1953, partially for his services in writing and editing the histories."]}, {"page": "Quebec Agreement", "response": ["The only part of the Quebec Agreement that troubled Stimson was the requirement for mutual consent before atomic bombs could be used. Had Congress known about it, they would never have supported it. The American veto over post-war British commercial and industrial uses made it clear that Britain was the junior partner in the Grand Alliance. Churchill in particular considered the Quebec Agreement to be the best deal he could have struck under the circumstances, and the restrictions were the price he had to pay to obtain the technical information needed for a successful post-war nuclear weapons project. Margaret Gowing noted that the \"idea of the independent deterrent was already well entrenched.\""]}, {"page": "Frederick E. Morgan", "response": ["Morgan was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Royal Artillery from 24 June 1948 until 24 June 1958 In 1951, he succeeded Lord Portal as Controller of Atomic Energy. The position had been created in January 1946 as \"Controller of Production, Atomic Energy\" when the Ministry of Supply had assumed responsibility for nuclear weapons. The job, the title of which was changed to \"Controller Atomic Energy\" in 1950, had no written terms of reference, but carried broad responsibility for the coordination of all aspects of nuclear weapons production. Although located within the Ministry of Supply, the controller had direct access to the Prime Minister; Portal rarely exercised this, however. It was widely believed that Morgan, who was, in the words of Margaret Gowing, \"amiable but not adequate to the task\", had been appointed by mistake, having been confused with his namesake, General Sir William Morgan. The latter had greatly impressed Prime Minister Clement Attlee as Army member of the Joint Staff Mission to the United States from 1947 to 1950. Morgan, therefore, relied heavily on his key subordinates, Sir John Cockcroft, William Penney, and Christopher Hinton."]}, {"page": "Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum", "response": ["The research from the MAUD committee was compiled in two reports, commonly known as the MAUD reports in July 1941.

Of necessity, the universities employed many aliens or ex-aliens. The MAP was initially opposed to their employment on security grounds, especially as most were from enemy or occupied countries. Their employment was only made possible because they were employed by the universities and not the MAP, which was not allowed to employ enemy aliens. The MAP gradually came around to accepting their employment on the project. It protected some from internment, and provided security clearances. There were restrictions on where enemy aliens could work and live, and they were not allowed to own cars, so dispensations were required to allow them to visit other universities. \"And so,\" wrote historian Margaret Gowing, \"the greatest of all the wartime secrets was entrusted to scientists excluded for security reasons from other war work.\""]}, {"page": "Summertown, Oxford", "response": ["*Margaret Gowing, academic, first Professor of the History of Science at the University of Oxford, Fellow of Linacre College."]}, {"page": "Northmoor Road", "response": ["Charles Firth, Professor of History at the University of Oxford, lived at No. 2 Northmoor Road, a distinctive house with a two-storey bow-front, designed by E.
