In 1994, his single \"Eighteen Strings\" (also written as \"18 Strings\") became an international club hit. It was rumoured that the original bootleg recording of \"Eighteen Strings\" contained a sample of the riff from \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana, and that the usage of the sample was disallowed, therefore it was reproduced for commercial release. However, the riffs from the bootleg and commercial release were both produced by Dakeyne. The song was a Top 10 hit in the UK Singles Chart.In addition to this commercial success, Dakeyne also remixed many tracks for DMC which were released on a \"DJ Only\" basis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tin Man", "response": ["* Tinman (born 1961), British electronic musician"]}, {"page": "FFRR Records", "response": ["* Tinman"]}, {"page": "Martin/Molloy", "response": ["The theme song to this radio show was \"Eighteen Strings\" by Tinman.http://www.happyhardcore.com/forums/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=&TOPIC_ID=8320&bhcp=1"]}, {"page": "Angels in Disguise (album)", "response": ["Angels in Disguise is the second album released by Interface and considered by many of its fans as its best to date.
