Fellow historian Kenneth O. Morgan called him \"perhaps the leading authority on the international crises of the 1930s, appeasement and the coming of war\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neville Chamberlain", "response": ["In reaction to the revisionist school of thought regarding Chamberlain a post-revisionist school emerged beginning in the 1990s, using the released papers to justify the initial conclusions of Guilty Men. Oxford historian R. A. C. Parker argued that Chamberlain could have forged a close alliance with France after the Anschluss, in early 1938, and begun a policy of containment of Germany under the auspices of the League of Nations. While many revisionist writers had suggested that Chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions, Parker argued that Chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies. In his two volumes, Chamberlain and Appeasement (1993) and Churchill and Appeasement (2000), Parker stated that Chamberlain, due to his \"powerful, obstinate personality\" and his skill in debate, caused Britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence. Parker also suggested that had Churchill held high office in the second half of the 1930s Churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred Hitler, and perhaps would have caused Hitler's domestic opponents to procure his removal."]}, {"page": "Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)", "response": ["Coke has been described as \"the real hero of Norfolk agriculture\", despite the fact that his land was so poor one critic is said to have remarked that \"the thin sandy soil must be ploughed by rabbits yoked to a pocket knife\".Riches (1967) p. 33. However, academics and writers dispute his importance. 19th and early 20th century historians held him to be the crucial figure of the British Agricultural Revolution, crediting him with inventing four-crop rotation.Mitchell (2010) p. 27. Naomi Riches describes this as an \"error\",Riches (1967) p. 7. and R. A. C. Parker, writing in the Economic History Review, states that \"many of the innovations he is supposed to have introduced should be attributed to his predecessors in Norfolk\"; however that \"is not to deny the substantial contribution of Coke himself to the advance of farming technique in England\".Parker (1955) p. 165."]}, {"page": "R A C Parker", "response": ["#REDIRECT R.

A. C. Parker's 1994 book Chamberlain and Appeasement, by expanding it to include appeasement in society and looking at economic appeasement, the mass media and the opponents of appeasement. McDonough accepted that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, but unlike the revisionists he argued that it was poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. He suggested that appeasement must be analysed as a usable policy at the time it operated and focus on how Chamberlain's personality played a crucial role in the conduct of the policy, in particular, his errors of judgement, his failure to listen to opponents and his unwillingness to try any alternatives. McDonough argues that Chamberlain's version of appeasement, as operated by such an inflexible politician, unwilling to change direction, until events forced him to, actually contributed to Britain and France entering the war in 1939 in a much weaker strategic position, and passed the early advantage in the war to Hitler's regime, which meant that Germany only faced one European front until June 1944.", "The study was reviewed in academic journals. Parker described it as \"very well written, with a lively argument, which explores appeasement in society too\".R. A. C. Parker review, Manchester University Press catalogue, 1999. Andrew Thorpe, a leading authority on foreign affairs, described the book as \"a cogent and stimulating analysis of appeasement which will take the debate still deeper\".See Andrew Thorpe review in Archives (1999), A leading US historian of foreign affairs from the Reed College, Edward B. Segel, commented: \"The book brings out effectively how the British government manipulated the mass-media, the press and especially the BBC to exclude public criticism of Chamberlain's policies and convey the impression of overwhelming support\".Albion, vol 31 (1999).
