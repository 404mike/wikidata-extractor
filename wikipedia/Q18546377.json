Henson stated that he had got the greater part of his information about Lee from certain 'ancient stocking makers' who all gave a similar account, and that the authenticity of the story is 'in some measure confirmed by the arms of the London Framework Knitters, which consist of a stocking-frame without the woodwork, with a clergyman on one hand and a woman on the other, as supporters.'G.
