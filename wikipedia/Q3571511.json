He then spent the summer season at the Queen's Theatre in Blackpool in The Time of Your Life\u2014a performance which was also broadcast by the BBC. One of the acts in the show was the singer Yana, with whom Formby had an affair, made easier because of Beryl's absence from the theatre through illness. His final televised performance, a 35-minute BBC programme, The Friday Show: George Formby, was aired on 16 December. Bret considers the programme to be Formby's \"greatest performance\u2014it was certainly his most sincere\", although reviewing for The Guardian, Mary Crozier thought it \"too slow\". She went on to say \"George Formby is really a music-hall star, and it needs the warmth and sociability of the theatre to bring out his full appeal\". Beryl's illness was worsening. Worn down by the strain, and feeling the need to escape, Formby took the part of Mr Wu in Aladdin in Bristol, having turned down a more lucrative part in Blackpool."]}, {"page": "Water Stratford", "response": ["More recent former residents are Paul Daniels, magician, Peter Woodthorpe, actor, and Yana (singer), (real name Pamela Guard)."]}, {"page": "The Cockleshell Heroes", "response": ["* Yana as Pub Singer (uncredited)", "The then-famous British singer, Yana (Pamela Guard), is shown in a cameo role as a sweetly-singing blonde Wren (Women's Royal Naval Service member) in a pub scene, shortly before a brawl erupts."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Edwards", "response": ["In December 1958, Jimmy Edwards played the King in Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella at the London Coliseum with Kenneth Williams, Tommy Steele, Yana and Betty Marsden; Bobby Howell was the Musical Director."]}, {"page": "The Ship That Died of Shame", "response": ["*Yana, as a woman singer performing We'll Meet Again in a room off the bar of the Coastal Forces Club"]}, {"page": "Pigalle Club", "response": ["The Beatles played a concert at the Pigalle on 21 April 1963.
