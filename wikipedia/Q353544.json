Beckwith's analysis of the Aristocles Passage, adiaphora, astathm\u0113ta, and anepikrita are strikingly similar to the Buddhist three marks of existence, indicating that Pyrrho's teaching is based on Buddhism. Beckwith disputes Bett's argument about the translators, as the other reports of using translators in India, involving Alexander the Great and Nearchus, say they needed only one interpreter, and Onesicritus was criticized by other writers in antiquity for exaggerating. Beckwith also contends that the 18 months Pyrrho spent in India was long enough to learn a foreign language, and that the key innovative tenets of Pyrrho's skepticism were only found in Indian philosophy at the time and not in Greece.

Instead of this 'literal' view, he interpreted the true meaning of rebirth as the re-arising of the sense of self or \"I\" or \"me\", a kind of \"self-centredness\" which is \"a mental event arising out of ignorance, craving, and clinging.\" According to Buddhad\u0101sa, this is what \"rebirth\" truly means on the ultimate level (paramattha) of discourse."]}, {"page": "List of writers on Buddhism", "response": ["* Stephen Batchelor"]}, {"page": "Lineage (Buddhism)", "response": ["The historical authenticity of Buddhist lineage is questionable.
