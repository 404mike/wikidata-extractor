The early cast featured just 16 characters and it would be a full 12 months before the six houses in Brookside Close became fully occupied. This was intentional, as Redmond wanted to reflect the pace of real life 'new-build' estate occupancy. Therefore, introductory episodes concentrated on the development of the anchor Grant family, with Sheila (Sue Johnston) and Bobby (Ricky Tomlinson) who had moved up the social ladder to a big, four-bedroomed house on the 'middle-class' Brookside Close from a run-down council estate. The Grants were the first family to have moved onto the Close and they lived at number 5 and were the focus of earliest advertising campaigns promoting the programme. Initially, only three of the six new-builds were occupied by characters and Episode 1 saw the arrival of the Collins family led by Annabelle (Doreen Sloane), who is the first actor to be seen in the first episode, and Paul Collins (Jim Wiggins). In contrast to the Grants, the Collinses were on their way down the social ladder, downsizing from their lavish home on the upmarket Wirral, to the smaller, more modest, number 8 Brookside Close following Paul's redundancy. The contrast between the families was heavily featured, particularly Bobby's left wing and Paul's right wing views. Other characters included Heather Black (Amanda Burton in her TV debut) and Roger Huntington (Rob Spendlove), two young professionals residing at semi-detached number 9 who took an instant dislike to the Grants. Low class newly-weds Gavin (Daniel Webb) and Petra Taylor (Alexandra Pigg) moved into number 10 during very early episodes, memorably selling stolen cookers from the front lawn, infuriating their new neighbours.Brookside.

Having divorced her first husband Roger in 1983, Heather reverted to her maiden name, Haversham, and returned to her career as an accountant. In November 1985 she met and quickly married Nicholas, but she was unaware that he was a secret heroin addict. Although Nick (as he was generally known) attempted to keep to his promise to his wife to give up heroin, the pull of the drug became stronger.

The character debuted on-screen during the first episode of Brookside, broadcast on 2 November 1982. Barry is one of the show's original characters and the only character to appear in the first and final episodes of Brookside. Usher decided to leave Brookside in 1984, but returned the following year and remained a regular cast member until 1995. He then returned for guest stints in 1996, 1997 and 2003. Barry is characterised as a \"hard man\" and constant law breaker. Writers transformed Barry into Brookside's long-standing villainous character. Despite his hard man characterisation, Barry has a special relationship with his mother Sheila Grant (Sue Johnston). He would do anything to protect Sheila and to the extent that it created problems with his father Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson).", "When the series begins, Barry is in his mid-twenties and lives with his family consisting of his mother Sheila Grant (Sue Johnston), father Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson) and his two younger siblings Karen Grant (Shelagh O'Hara) and Damon Grant (Simon O'Brien).Redmond 1987, p.21. Prior to the series' debut, Channel 4 publicity described Barry as a twenty-three year old \"football fanatic and a carpenter on a building site. He has a reputation as a hard-man.\" Barry is portrayed as different from the rest of his family. Early on in his story Barry gets involved in law-breaking scams, yet his mother, who is a devout Catholic is willing to ignore his behaviour. In the book Brookside: The Official Companion, show creator Phil Redmond explained that there was a special relationship between the two. Barry would do anything for Sheila to the extent it creates conflict with his father, Bobby.Redmond 1987, p.22. Writers portrayed Barry helping Sheila overcome her rape ordeal. He takes her shopping and encourages her to be brave. Bobby becomes more jealous of their bond because he had failed to help Sheila deal with her attack.Redmond 1987, p.103. Barry and Bobby find it difficult to tolerate one another and the latter views his son as a jobless \"layabout\". He believes that Barry has succumbed to Conservative propaganda and should find work and stop gallivanting. Barry rarely speaks to his father unless it is to argue with him. Bobby is a socialist and thinks that Barry's generation lack commitment. They are both jealous of one another's relationships with Sheila and writers often used it to create tension between them. Redmond wrote that \"Sigmund Freud would have had a field day\" studying the dynamic between the three characters.

She is mother to James and Tash, and widow of Mike. After the death of her husband, James takes over the surgery and replaces Sal with his wife, Yasmeen. Sal subsequently joins the Women's Guild to give herself something to do. Her best friend Tip helps her get her old job back by bringing in James' old headmistress Joyce Midge for a smear test. Overwhelmed with embarrassment, James accepts Sal back part-time on her old wage. As the practise nurse, Sal is responsible for Rosie's well being, and is sympathetic towards her condition. She usually steps to defuse the situations caused by Rosie and Margaret's antics, maintaining that she is no danger to anyone. In the Christmas Special, it is revealed that Sal had still not scattered Mike's ashes, and she asks Spike to send them up over the town in a firework. This is not quite done to plan, as the firework is instead used to end the pantomime that Sal helped produce, cast and choreograph, and the ashes end up scattered over the audience and the cast. In the third series, Sal is dismayed to find that her privacy is being invaded by builders and bulldozers, as a residence for esteemed actor Charles Dance (ostensibly) was to be built behind her house. In addition, she begins seeing older patients at her house, which leads to accusations of her being a prostitute.
