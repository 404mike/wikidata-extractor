This side of the ground was occupied by uncovered terracing ever since the club moved from their first home, the John O'Gaunt's Ground, in 1895.

The stand cost around \u00a31 million to build and meant that the stadium had been completely redeveloped from its previous state in the 1980s (at a total cost of \u00a33 million). Over the years the stand has been known under three different guises, depending on sponsorship contracts. It was first known as the Linpave Stand and, in 1998, was sponsored by Simons Construction. It was named the Lincolnshire Co-operative stand in 2001, but is more commonly known as the Co-op stand.
