It was there that Berners-Lee told him about a system he and his team at CERN were developing, which with the aid of computer terminals, would enable its staff to view and edit the vast amounts of information the facility was generating and storing in hypertext documents. He said the system could be scaled up for use worldwide, and would enable users of computers connected to the Internet to access, edit and share documents  in the same way too \u2013 he called this new system the World Wide Web. Thinking this sounded a bit pretentious, not to mention a mouthful to pronounce, Ritchie convinced himself it would not come to much and duly rejected the idea as a viable business proposition. From that day on HTML and HTTP remained free and non-proprietary. Over the next few years, the number of web sites online grew from 1  in 1991, to over 1 billion by 2014. From its humble beginnings, the web grew into the enormous global communications and commercial system it is today.\nFrom 1997 onwards, Ritchie became involved in venture capital and was the founding chairman of several Scottish IT companies, including Voxar, VIS Entertainment, Orbital Software Group, and Digital Bridges. He has also been on the board of Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council, and Channel Four Television Corporation.\nHe was a founding director and chairman of the Scottish Software Federation from 1988 to 1990, and served as president of the British Computer Society from 1998 to 1999.\nIn the New Year Honours 2003, Ritchie was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to enterprise and education. Ritchie also holds honorary doctorates from four Scottish universities.\nAs of 2019, he is the non-executive chairman of Tern plc, Computer Applications Service, and Krotos; he is a board director of Shotscope Ltd, and was chairman of iomart Group plc from 2008 to 2018. He serves on the board of the National Theatre of Scotland, and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI).\nBetween 2012 and 2016 he was vice-president for business of The Royal Society of Edinburgh, having become a Fellow in 2002, and also honorary treasurer of the Royal Academy of Engineering, having become a Fellow in 2001.\nHis writes a column in Scottish Business Insider magazine, and his TED talk has been viewed over 600,000 times.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Guide (hypertext)", "response": ["Ian Ritchie, founder of OWL, presented a TED talk in 2011 describing his missed opportunity to convert Guide to a graphical browser for the Web at its inception in 1990, titled \"The day I turned down Tim Berners-Lee.\""]}, {"page": "Office Workstations Limited", "response": ["OWL was founded in 1984 by five former employees of ICL (Ian Ritchie, Stuart Harper, Gordon Dougan, Richard Stonehouse and Dave MacLaren) who had previously worked at ICL's Scottish Development Centre at Dalkeith Palace until its closure the previous year."]}, {"page": "Heriot-Watt University", "response": ["* Ian Ritchie, British businessman, founder of OWL, missed WWW opportunity of Tim Berners-Lee"]}, {"page": "Ritchie", "response": ["*Ian Ritchie (producer), composer and musician", "*Ian Ritchie (architect) (born 1947), British architect", "*Ian Ritchie (entrepreneur), Scottish businessman"]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the British Computer Society", "response": ["* 1998\u20131999 Ian Ritchie CBE FRSE FREng"]}, {"page": "Ian Ritchie", "response": ["Ian Ritchie may refer to:", "* Ian Ritchie (producer), composer, producer, arranger and saxophonist", "* Ian Ritchie (architect) (born 1947), British architect", "** Ian Ritchie Architects", "* Ian Ritchie (entrepreneur), Scottish businessman"]}]}}
