He then became club secretary at Inverness. After this, he spent seven seasons as player-manager of Sunderland during one of their most productive playing periods, winning the 1901\u201302 Football League championship, though his involvement in the Andy McCombie scandal brought a suspension imposed by the Football Association.\nHe was one of seventy applicants for the Middlesbrough job after Jack Robson departed and his record at Roker Park convinced the board that he was the man for the job, starting work in the summer of 1905. Following the football payments scandal at the end of 1905, he received a ban forbidding him from any active participation in football, unlike his predecessor who had the foresight to obtain a letter of absolution from the club chairman. However, Mackie was disillusioned with football by this point and so pre-empted the ban by voluntarily severing his interests.\nHe took over the Star and Garter Hotel in Marton Road, Middlesbrough in June 1906.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sunderland A.F.C.", "response": ["Scotsman Alex Mackie replaced Campbell as manager for the 1899 season.Days, pp. 55\u201356.
