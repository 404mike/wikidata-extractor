In three early episodes, Teal had been played by Campbell Singer, Norman Pitt, and Wensley Pithey; Dean featured from the episode \"Iris\" (7 November 1963) onward. Teal's relationship with Templar was broadly similar to that depicted in the novels, but in the series, he is often depicted as bungling, rather than merely Charteris's characterisation of him as an officious, unimaginative policeman. When in France, Templar had a similar relationship with Colonel Latignant (Arnold Diamond). Latignant is depicted as being even less competent than Teal, and is even keener than Teal to find Templar guilty, though Templar repeatedly helps him solve the case. Unlike Teal, Latignant did not appear in Charteris's novels. In all, Inspector Teal featured in 26 episodes and Colonel Latignant in six."]}, {"page": "Ivor", "response": ["* Ivor Dean (1917\u20131974), British actor"]}, {"page": "The Sorcerers", "response": ["* Ivor Dean as Inspector Matalon"]}, {"page": "Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde", "response": ["* Ivor Dean as William Burke"]}, {"page": "The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins", "response": ["* Ivor Dean as Policeman"]}, {"page": "Salt and Pepper (film)", "response": ["* Ivor Dean as Police Commissioner"]}, {"page": "Claud Eustace Teal", "response": ["On television, Ivor Dean played Teal as a recurring character in the 1962\u201369 British series, The Saint.
