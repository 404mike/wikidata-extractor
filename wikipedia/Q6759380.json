She was educated at Micklefield and Herschel Girls School. She graduated in 1954 from the University of Cape Town with a MBChB. As a student she helped her father, Sandy Blagden, establish CAFDA, an organisation that raised funds for the development of poor communities living on the Cape Flats by selling second hand books. CAFDA bookshops still flourish today. During those years she also co-founded SHAWCO. IAfter years of working at the Red Cross Hospital she realised the priority of education in helping families rise above their impoverished conditions, and began recycling school textbooks from privileged white schools to poor black schools. In 1970 she founded the African Scholar's Fund, and later TECSAT (Technical College Student Aid Trust Western Cape). She has worked as a medical officer for the Janet Bourhill Institute from 1961 to 1994. In 1987 she was awarded an honorary Master of Social Sciences from the University of Cape Town.
