Ray's a new face, but there's a degree of  about the music here; it owes much of its clout to a reworked Bo Diddley guitar riff.\" People Magazine stated that Jimmy Ray \"exudes the sort of animal magnetism that has been a pop rarity lately.\"", "# \"Are You Jimmy Ray?\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:29 (Sax \u2013 Gary Barnacle)", "# \"Are You Jimmy Ray?\" (Jimcon Extended Mix) \u2013 6:10", "# \"Are You Jimmy Ray?\" (Xenomania Club Mix) \u2013 6:45", "\"Are You Jimmy Ray?\" was featured in an episode of the American teen sitcom Clueless and was also featured in an episode of the MTV animated series, Daria.
