Harrison's idea was to play a guitar phrase as a response to each line of the vocal, which did not fit with McCartney's conception of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed it. Author Simon Leng views this as indicative of how Harrison was increasingly allowed little room to develop ideas on McCartney compositions, whereas he was free to create empathetic guitar parts for Lennon's songs of the period.

Also in the lineup was American pianist Mike Garson, who was hired by Bowie at the suggestion of RCA executive Ken Glancey and singer-songwriter Annette Peacock. The pianist came from a jazz and blues background, which Pegg believes veered the album from pure rock 'n' roll and expanded Bowie's experimental horizons. Buckley called Aladdin Sane the beginning of Bowie's \"experimental phase\" and cited Garson's presence as \"revolutionary\". Scott noted that Garson added elements to the arrangements that were not there before, including more keyboards and synthesisers. Garson later said that Scott as producer \"got the best piano sound out of any of his performances for Bowie.\" Garson remembered being given a lot of attention from Bowie in the studio, who mainly wanted to see what Garson could do.

Ken Scott, who had engineered Bowie's two previous records, was hired to co-produce alongside him. Scott accepted the position as a way to gain experience, although at the time he didn't believe Bowie would become a huge star. His debut as a producer, Scott would borrow some of the acoustic sounds of George Harrison's All Things Must Pass (1970), an album he engineered. Scott would retain the role of co-producer for Bowie's next three records: Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane and Pin Ups. Bowie played demos for Scott and the two picked which ones would be recorded for the album. On 8 June, the band recorded \"Song for Bob Dylan\", although according to Pegg this version was scrapped and the released version was not recorded until 23 June. Scott later recalled that recording went very quickly: \"Almost everything was done in one take.\" He was surprised when he and the Spiders would think a vocal or guitar part needed re-recording but Bowie would say \"No, wait, listen\", and when everything was played simultaneously it would sound perfect. Regarding Bowie's talent as a vocalist, Scott stated: \"He was unique.

Originally written for Bowie's friend Dana Gillespie, the song is based around a riff played on two acoustic guitars that heavily resembles the intro of Ron Davies' \"Silent Song Across the Land\". The lyrics emphasise Warhol's belief that life and art blur together. The song's opening features Ken Scott saying \"This is 'Andy Warhol', and it's take one\", only for Bowie to correct his pronunciation of \"Warhol\". When Bowie met Warhol in September 1971 and played the song for him, Warhol hated it and left the room; Bowie recalled in 1997 that he found the meeting \"fascinating\" because Warhol had \"nothing to say at all, absolutely nothing\".", "Although Bowie normally waited to name his albums until the last possible moment, the title \"Hunky Dory\" was announced at the John Peel session. Grace got the idea from an Esher pub landlord. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of Alias David Bowie, that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was infused with \"upper-crust jargon\" such as \"prang\" and \"whizzo\" and \"everything's hunky-dory\". Grace told Bowie, who loved it. Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may also have played a part. Spitz states that \"hunky-dory\" is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world. The original UK cover featured Bowie's name and the album title; in the US the title was instead printed on a sticker and placed onto the translucent wrapping. According to Cann, initial UK pressings were laminated, which enhanced the colour to create a \"superior finish\"; these pressings are now collector's items. The back cover featured Bowie's handwritten notes about each song from the album.
