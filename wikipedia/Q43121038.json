This research investigated important trade-offs that govern diversification of strategies of plants in order to understand the similarities and differences across species. Westoby was a leader in the communal effort to compile trait data worldwide, and is currently working on a similar approach to ecological strategies across bacteria and archaea. Earlier in his career Westoby created a state-and-transition approach to managing ecosystem change that has been widely adopted, for example being now mandatory throughout rangelands in the U.S. He also initiated the linear programming approach to diet optimization under multiple constraints, and the kin-conflict interpretation of the triploid endosperm of angiosperms.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clarke Medal", "response": ["* 2005: Mark Westoby (Botany)"]}, {"page": "BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards", "response": ["| Mark Westoby"]}, {"page": "Australian Laureate Fellowship", "response": ["|Mark Westoby"]}, {"page": "List of American Academy of Arts and Sciences members (2006\u20132019)", "response": ["* Mark Westoby"]}]}}
