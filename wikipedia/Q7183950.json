After the Doctor foils this plan, they decide to crash their freighter into the planet to achieve the same result.

In the pilot episode, titled \"A Girl's Best Friend\", Sarah Jane receives the robot dog K9 Mark III (John Leeson) as a Christmas present from The Doctor. The pilot did not lead to a series, but the character reappeared in Doctor Who for the 1983 twentieth anniversary story The Five Doctors, in which she is transported to Gallifrey by Lord President Borusa (Philip Latham) to take part in the Game of Rassilon in The Death Zone devised by Time Lord founder Rassilon (Richard Mathews). Here, Sarah is reunited with the Third Doctor, and also meets the First, Second and Fifth. The Five Doctors shows that Sarah Jane still owns and is working with K9. The character made an appearance in the 1993 Children in Need special (a crossover with long-running British soap EastEnders), Dimensions in Time, wherein various Doctors and companions are teleported to Albert Square as part of a plot by the Rani (Kate O'Mara). Though Sladen would not make any more official Doctor Who television appearances until 2006, in the interval the actress reprised her role as Sarah Jane twice on BBC radio with Jon Pertwee, and in a series of Big Finish audio dramas, and in the unofficial direct-to-video spin-off film Downtime (1995) alongside the Brigadier, Second Doctor companion Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling) and Leeson in a rare on-screen role."]}, {"page": "List of fictional politicians", "response": ["* Lord President Borusa (Leonard Sachs, Philip Latham) \u2013 Gallifrey, Doctor Who"]}, {"page": "Force 10 from Navarone (film)", "response": ["* Philip Latham as Commander Jensen"]}, {"page": "Venus in fiction", "response": ["While the idea of colonizing Venus has been penned as early as J.
