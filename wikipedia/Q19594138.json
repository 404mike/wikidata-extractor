In April 2016, after the departure of their previous manager, Bado took joint-caretaker charge of the club along with former national team coach David Wilson. While Bado was a candidate for the job on a permanent basis in the summer, Wilson was given the job. However, Wilson resigned from the post in September 2016 after Lions' ownership entered financial difficulties, joining Bruno's Magpies instead, and Rafael Bado was eventually given the job instead. He retired as a player at this time in order to focus on club management. However, in January 2017 he re-registered as a player, making his first appearance off the bench in Lions' 2\u20130 defeat to Gibraltar Phoenix in the 2017 Rock Cup. He went on to play 3 more games in the season, all as a substitute. He remained a registered player the next season. After leaving the club in the summer, he joined Mons Calpe in July 2018.

After a difficult start to the 2016\u201317 season saw Lions only win one game in 4 months, a number of new signings in January 2017 saw significant improvement and allowed Bado to steer the club clear of relegation, eventually finishing 4 points clear of the relegation playoff in 8th place. Further changes to the squad over the summer saw him lead Lions to an impressive start to the next season, with a victory over reigning champions Europa FC putting them in the race for a position in next season's UEFA Europa League.
