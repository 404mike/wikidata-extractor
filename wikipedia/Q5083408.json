Tomlinson was an extremely speedy winger with an accurate shot and his style of play was similar to that of Joe Turner, who had retired a year earlier. Unfortunately, he had an \"excitable temperament\" and suffered badly from nerves, especially away from The Dell, and he \"often failed to deliver the goods on opponents' pitches\".
