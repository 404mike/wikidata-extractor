He joined the Birmingham City Police in 1890. He achieved very rapid promotion within this force and in 1901 became chief constable of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. In 1903 he successfully applied for the chief constable's office at Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, where he remained until his retirement in 1944. During his time there he achieved many early improvements in policing at Halifax, some of which were later used nationwide. The most notable were the installing of coloured lights as traffic signals at road junctions, the formalisation of procedures for police identity parades, making 'keep left' mandatory for traffic and the installation of police telephones in the town, among others. In later years he was recognized as being a policeman who was ahead of his time. He came from a police family: his father, Frank Richardson (1851\u20131938), was the Chief Constable of Hereford from 1882 until 1920, and his elder brother, Ernest Frank Richardson (1871\u20131952), served as Chief Constable of Salisbury between 1903 and 1929.1) Police Gazette November 1903. 2) Police Gazette September 1929. 3) Cheltenham Chronicle 17 October 1903.

He also had three other brothers who served in other police forces.", "The Halifax Borough Committee and Watch Committee had complete control over the Force at this time. There was a great deal of discontent in the Halifax Force and Richardson thought his men were getting a raw deal from the Borough Watch Committee but got short shrift from them when he tried to improve their working life. Apparently he got very tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time.Newspaper Halifax Guardian 1909.

His men were very grateful for his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax.West Yorkshire Police Magazine The Beat July 2011. Article, Plaque erected in Alfred's memory. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements. Alfred Richardson tended to favour the Bertillon (1853\u20131914) method which involved several body measurements being recorded.
