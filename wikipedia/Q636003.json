Diaz's other film that year was Gambit, a remake of the 1966 film of the same name directed by Michael Hoffman and scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews, and performed poorly at the box office, grossing only US$10million internationally.

Although puzzled at first, he recalled his pregnancy experience as \"funny, tragic, exciting\" and \"hilarious\", and thought combining these elements would make for a \"really interesting\" film. Speaking about the film's theme, he stated that \"everybody's experience is different\" and multiple different stories \"allow the audience to share in everything that is going on\" and \"by sharing in what's going on and seeing so many characters, there's this energy, and there's humor and there's drama in comparing all of the stories, which are taking place at the same time\". What to Expect When You're Expecting stars an ensemble cast, which focuses primarily on the five couples who are going to be first-time parents. According to Access Atlanta, the project also needed \"a lot of extras who are in the family way\" as well as \"babies with star potential\". An open casting call was held on July 9, 2011.
