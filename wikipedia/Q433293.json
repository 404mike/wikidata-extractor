Some noted observers, such as Margaret Court, suggested that Graf could achieve the feat a couple more times. And the year began as expected, with Graf extending her Grand Slam tournament winning streak to five events at the Australian Open, defeating Helena Sukov\u00e1 in the final. Her 6\u20133, 6\u20130 defeat of Gabriela Sabatini in a semifinal was described by veteran observer Ted Tinling as \"probably the best tennis I've seen\".\"Australian Tennis\", March 1989, p. 28 He went on to add, \"I saw what Steffi did to Sabatini at the Australian Open this year, and that was it.

The American player Billie Jean King acknowledged her as an influence.  She was also known for her on-court style, wearing tennis dresses designed by Ted Tinling."]}]}}
