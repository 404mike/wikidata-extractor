The group, whose best-known line-up comprised Mike Score, Ali Score, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds, hit the peak of their chart success in the early 1980s.", "A Flock of Seagulls was started by Mike Score in late 1979 in Liverpool. According to Mike Score, the band's name was taken from the song \"Toiler on the Sea\" by punk rock band the Stranglers  and the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull. The original line-up of the band featured Mike Score on lead vocals, keyboards and occasionally rhythm guitar, Paul Reynolds lead guitar, Ali Score on drums, and Frank Maudsley on bass. Guitarist Willie Woo was added, while Mark Edmondson replaced Ali on drums when the Score brothers fell out. Soon afterwards, Edmondson departed to make way for a returning Ali, while teenager Paul Reynolds, a close friend of Edmondson, replaced Woo at the behest of Maudsley, thus creating the band's classic line-up. The band practised above Mike Score's hair salon, and then started playing clubs, eventually signing a recording contract.", "On Memorial Day Weekend, Saturday, 28 May 1983, A Flock of Seagulls performed at the US Festival along with Oingo Boingo, Men at Work, and others. Three more singles were released from Listen in 1983, including a re-recorded version of their debut single \"(It's Not Me) Talking\", but they were only minor successes in the UK and abroad. Faced with disappointment, the group changed direction from their science fiction themes and produced a more conceptual emotion-based third album in 1984 called The Story of a Young Heart, with \"The More You Live, the More You Love\" as the lead single. Despite heavy rotation on MTV and other music video shows at that time, the single was only moderately successful, and the album's other two singles \u2013 \"Never Again (The Dancer)\" and \"Remember David\" (released only in a few European countries) \u2013 did not make any headway. Faced with sliding sales and a loss of direction, the band continued to consider their options whilst touring. During this period, Paul Reynolds left the band, and was replaced by Gary Steadman (from Classix Nouveaux). Keyboardist Chris Chryssaphis was added at the same time to augment their sound. Both stayed in the band for the recording and release of next the album\u2013Dream Come True\u2013but departed once the tour had ended. The album was released in 1985 in the UK and 1986 in the US, and failed to chart, thus leading to the dissolving of the band until 1988.", "In 1998, Berner, Walker, and Pichette departed the band and were replaced by Joe Rodriguez, Darryl Sons, and Rob Wright, respectively. In 1999, the band re-recorded the Madonna song \"This Used to Be My Playground\" for the 2000 Madonna tribute album The World's Greatest 80s Tribute to Madonna. In November 2003, the original lineup of Mike and Ali Score, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series Bands Reunited. In September 2004, they reformed again and did a brief tour in the United States. Though the tour continued to be advertised as the \"original lineup\", later shows no longer included the original band, but was Mike Score's continuation of the newer band; which by this point consisted of Score, Rodriguez, and new recruits Michael Brahm (drums), and Pando (bass guitar). In 2005, this version of the group starred in the American version of the entertainment show Hit Me Baby, One More Time, where they performed \"I Ran\" and a cover of Ryan Cabrera's song, \"On The Way Down\" for a chance to have $20,000 donated to a charity of their choice.", "In June 2011, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds performed at Croxteth Park music festival in Liverpool, under the name 'A Flock of Seagulls'.", "Their dramatic style has drawn much criticism and parody, but the band has also been recognized as a pioneering act, capturing the spirit of their time, particularly with the guitar work of Paul Reynolds and sonically multi-layered hits such as \"Space Age Love Song,\" \"Telecommunication,\" and \"Modern Love Is Automatic\". The band also is noted for creating a successful concept album, their debut, which alludes to an alien invasion of earth.

With a chord progression of A-G-A-G in the verses and F-G-A in the choruses, the song is written in the key of A minor. During the song's introduction and musical interludes, short guitar riffs are played, which make use of echo. Guitarist Paul Reynolds had joined the band after the music was already written, so the short guitar riffs were added for Reynolds to play. Lyrically, \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" is about a man who sees an attractive woman and attempts to run away from his feelings.
