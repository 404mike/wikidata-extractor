Milner, however, was not satisfied with his position in the Midlands. He had formed an alliance with the Irish bishops, and with their co-operation, a determined attempt was made to have him transferred to London as coadjutor with right of succession. This scheme was opposed by Bishop John Douglass, and ultimately defeated, though the pope consented that Milner should become parliamentary agent to the Irish bishops in their struggle to procure Catholic emancipation, and that for this purpose he should be permitted to go to London as often as necessary. This disagreement with his colleagues led to further results. Milner found fault with the manner in which the London District was governed, and was not afraid to say so publicly, in numerous pamphlets and other publications, and even in his pastorals. The subjects of contention were several; but two especially may be mentioned. One was the \" question of the Royal veto of the appointment of bishops, which first came into prominence in the year 1808. By this it was intended to concede to the Crown a negative voice in the election of Catholic bishops, by conferring a right to veto any candidate whose loyalty was open to question. The chief Irish bishops had agreed to the measure in 1799; but since then, owing to the postponement of emancipation, the scheme had dropped. Milner revived it, and was for a time the warm advocate of the veto. He found himself in opposition to most of the Irish bishops."]}, {"page": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle", "response": ["*John Douglass, appointed Vicar Apostolic of London District in 1790"]}, {"page": "John Daniel (priest)", "response": ["Daniel and about twenty-five professors and students arrived at Dover on 2 March 1795, along with Gregory Stapleton and sixty-four students from the English College at St. Omer.
