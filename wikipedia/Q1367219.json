The Orb's central figure, Alex Paterson, had early musical tastes and influences that included King Tubby, Alice Cooper, Prince, Kraftwerk, and T.Rex. Among these, Paterson cites Kraftwerk as one of the most important, claiming they created the foundation from which all modern dance music has been built. While in Brixton with Martin Glover as a teenager, Paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music, such as The Mighty Diamonds, The Abyssinians, and Bob Marley. The reggae influence on Paterson and the Orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single \"Perpetual Dawn\" and U.F.Orb's \"Towers of Dub\". The earliest ambient influences of the Orb came in 1979 during Paterson's roadie days with Killing Joke. While with the band in Neuss, Paterson listened to Brian Eno's Music for Films while on LSD and watched \"the Ruhr steel works explode in the distance\", noting that \"[t]he scene seemed to be taking place in the music as well\". The same night, Paterson was also inspired while listening to Cluster's Grosses Wasser and found that the steel works' \"huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to the music\", which was something he'd \"never seen, or heard, anything like it before\". Along with Cluster and Kraftwerk, Paterson was also influenced by other German experimental music from Can and composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Modulations calls Paterson's music a \"maximal\" version of Brian Eno's \"minimal\" ambience, though according to Paterson, Eno resents Paterson's use of his music as an influence."]}]}}
