He was Professor Emeritus of the History and Philosophy of Religion in the University of London, Fellow of University College London and Fellow of King's College London. During his long career he had been Professor of History and Philosophy of Religion at the University of Leeds, Lecturer at the University of Amsterdam and Wilde Lecturer at the University of Oxford.James received his education at Exeter College, Oxford and at University College London, where he studied under the noted egyptologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie.James was also a member of the Folklore Society, serving as its President from 1930 to 1932.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Murray", "response": ["The later folklorists Caroline Oates and Juliette Wood have suggested that Murray was best known for her witch-cult theory, with biographer Margaret S. Drower expressing the view that it was her work on this subject which \"perhaps more than any other, made her known to the general public\". It has been claimed that Murray's was the \"first feminist study of the witch trials\", as well as being the first to have actually \"empowered the witches\" by giving the (largely female) accused both free will and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators. The theory was faulty, in part because all of her academic training was in Egyptology, with no background knowledge in European history, but also because she exhibited a \"tendency to generalize wildly on the basis of very slender evidence\". Oates and Wood, however, noted that Murray's interpretations of the evidence fitted within wider perspectives on the past that existed at the time, stating that \"Murray was far from isolated in her method of reading ancient ritual origins into later myths\". In particular, her approach was influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, who had argued for the existence of a pervasive dying-and-resurrecting god myth, and she was also influenced by the interpretative approaches of E. O. James, Karl Pearson, Herbert Fleure, and Harold Peake.", "One of Murray's friends in the Society, E. O. James, described her as a \"mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge without reserve, or, be it said, much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts!\" Davidson described her as being \"not at all assertive\u00a0... [she] never thrust her ideas on anyone. [In relation to her witch-cult theory,] she behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect, or perhaps, of the Freemasons, but never on any account got into arguments about it in public.\" The archaeologist Glyn Daniel observed that Murray remained mentally alert into her old age, commenting that \"her vigour and forthrightness and ruthless energy never deserted her\"."]}, {"page": "Robert Charles Zaehner", "response": ["The book opens with a lucid statement of his own contested hermeneutic: \"with comparative religion,\" he says, \"the question is who's to be master, that's all\" (p.\u00a09).This concludes a conversation between Humpty-Dumpty and Alice, at page 11 in the Beacon edition. He starts by saluting E. O. James. Next Zaehner mentions Rudolph Otto (1869-1937) and al-Ghazali (1058-1111) as both being skeptics about any 'reasonable' writer with no religious experience who expounds on the subject. Here Zaehner acknowledges that many Christians may only be familiar with their own type of religion (similar to Judaism and Islam), and hence be ill-equipped to adequately comprehend Hindu or Buddhist mysticism (pp.\u00a012\u201315)."]}, {"page": "Edwin Oliver James", "response": ["#REDIRECT E.

A specific deity was often 'compromised' by the henotheistic assimilation of a wide range of other numinous powers. A local figure became goddess of a city, then a region, latter of an empire. Neumann used art of ancient goddesses in developing archetypes.Mircea Eliade (1978; 1982), A History of Religious Ideas (Paris: Payot; Univ. of Chicago), syncretism: pp. 208-209, 277-298.

The Terrible Mother may prompt the transformative 'fight with the dragon': \"Perseus must kill [her] before he can win Andromeda\". Circe, \"the enchantress who turns men into beasts, meets the superior Odysseus [and] invite him to share her bed\" (p.35), as ambivalent (cf., pp. 73-74).
