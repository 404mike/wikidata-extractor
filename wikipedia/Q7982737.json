Her poetry has been viewed as \"difficult to categorise\" and as \"multi- and non-linear\". Her early poetry had particularly strong feminist and Marxist elements, but latterly she has moved towards more personal themes.\nMulford's prose works include a combined biography of Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland, a book about female saints, and essays about poetry. In 2007, she started studying for a new career as a Jungian analyst.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Wendy Mulford (born 1941, W/E)"]}, {"page": "British Poetry Revival", "response": ["A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in Poetry Review under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, Bill Griffiths, Ulli Freer, cris cheek, Lawrence Upton, Robert Gavin Hampson, Robert Sheppard, and Ken Edwards were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at Gilbert Adair's Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as Caroline Bergvall, Paul Buck, Andrew Duncan, D. S. Marriott, Maggie O'Sullivan and Denise Riley. Edwards ran Reality Studios, a magazine that grew out of Alembic (UK poetry magazine), the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based Wendy Mulford, which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based Angel Exhaust magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, Robert Sheppard and Andrew Duncan. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's Figs magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets."]}, {"page": "Sylvia Townsend Warner", "response": ["Although Warner never wrote an autobiography, Scenes of Childhood was compiled after her death on 1 May 1978 at age 84, based on short reminiscences published over the years in the New Yorker. She also translated Contre Sainte-Beuve by Marcel Proust from the original French into English. In the 1970s, she became known as a significant writer of feminist or lesbian sentiment, and her novels were among the earlier ones to be revived by Virago Press. Selected letters of Warner and Valentine Ackland have been published twice: Wendy Mulford edited a collection titled This Narrow Place in 1988, and ten years later Susanna Pinney published another selection, I\u2019ll Stand by You."]}, {"page": "Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970", "response": ["John Agard - Tony Baker - Anthony Barnett  - Richard Caddel - Cris Cheek - Thomas A.

He has been involved in small-press publishing since 1973, when he started up the magazine Alembic with two other King's graduates, Robert Gavin Hampson and Peter Barry. During the same period, he set up Share Publications, which published a number of poetry pamphlets. In 1978 he moved to Lower Green Farm, outside Orpington, where he established an artists' commune and began Reality Studios, a magazine that helped introduce the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets to a British readership. He was one of four co-editors of The New British Poetry (1988). With the poet Wendy Mulford, he set up the literary press Reality Street in 1993 - she withdrew from the project in 1998, and Edwards continued to run the press on his own. As from 2016, it no longer publishes new titles. He was interviewed by Wolfgang Gortschacher about these activities, and the interview ('From Alembic to Reality Street Editions') was published in Gortschacher's substantial 'Contemporary Views on the Little Magazine Scene' (Poetry Salzburg, 2000). Edwards has published two accounts of the Lower Green Farm commune: in his essay in 'Clasp: late modernist poetry in London in the 1970s' (Shearsman, 2016), which he co-edited with Robert Hampson, and in 'Wild Metrics' (Grand Iota, 2019), where it is part of a more extended account of poetry (and alternative life in general) in London from the 1970s."]}, {"page": "John James (British poet)", "response": ["John James was born in 1939 in Cardiff to Lil (n\u00e9e O\u2019Reilly) and Charlie James, a royal marine.

Contemporary critical reaction finds much to value in Ackland's poetry and confessional writings, which are of historical interest to the development of self-reflective, modernist poetry, and to the political and cultural issues of the 1930s and 1940s. One example of a critical analysis is Wendy Mulford's book, This Narrow Place: Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland: Life, Letters and Politics, 1930-1951, Pandora, London, 1988. With regard to her self-reflection as a poet, Ackland exhibits themes and explorations similar to poets such as Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. Of interest, too, is Ackland's explorations of the personal effects of terminal illness as her life was drawing to a close from cancer. In her later years, Ackland turned from Catholicism to Quaker beliefs and also to involvement with issues of environmentalism.", "* Wendy Mulford, This Narrow Place: Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland: Life, Letters and Politics, 1930-1951, Pandora, London, 1988"]}, {"page": "Veronica Forrest-Thomson", "response": ["She studied at the University of Liverpool (BA, 1967) and Girton College, Cambridge (PhD, 1971) where her first supervisor was the poet J.
