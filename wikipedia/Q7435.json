Watts-Tobin to genetically demonstrate the triplet nature of the code of protein translation through the Crick, Brenner, Barnett, Watts-Tobin et al. experiment of 1961, which discovered frameshift mutations; this insight provided early elucidation of the nature of the genetic code.\nIn her professional life, Barnett was a microbiologist who joined the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, where she worked as an assistant mainly with Crick and later Brenner, with whom she remained for many years until he left and she retired.  During this long period, Barnett was involved in a number of the important 20th-century advances made in molecular biology and genetics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sydney Brenner", "response": ["Brenner made several seminal contributions to the emerging field of molecular biology in the 1960s (see Phage group). The first was to prove that all overlapping genetic coding sequences were impossible. This insight separated the coding function from structural constraints as proposed in a clever code by George Gamow. This led Francis Crick to propose the concept of the adaptor or as it is now known \"transfer RNA\" (tRNA). The physical separation between the anticodon and the amino acid on a tRNA is the basis for the unidirectional flow of information in coded biological systems. This is commonly known as the central dogma of molecular biology i.e. that information flows from nucleic acid to protein and never from protein to nucleic acid. Following this adaptor insight, Brenner conceived of the concept of messenger RNA during an April 1960 conversation with Francis Crick and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, and together with Jacob and Matthew Meselson went on to prove its existence later that summer.  Then, with Francis Crick, Leslie Barnett, and Richard J. Watts-Tobin, Brenner genetically demonstrated the triplet nature of the code of protein translation through the Crick, Brenner, Barnett, Watts-Tobin et al. experiment of 1961, which discovered frameshift mutations. Together with the decoding work of Marshall Warren Nirenberg and others, the discovery of the triplet nature of the genetic code was critical to deciphering the code. Leslie Barnett helped set up Sydney Brenner's laboratory in Singapore, many years later."]}, {"page": "Clare Hall, Cambridge", "response": ["In 1978 a second neighbouring house, now called Leslie Barnett House, was obtained for graduate student accommodation.

In 1961, Sydney Brenner, an early member of the phage group, collaborated with Francis Crick, Leslie Barnett and Richard Watts-Tobin at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge to perform genetic experiments that demonstrated the basic nature of the genetic code for proteins.  These experiments, carried out with mutants of the rIIB gene of phage T4, showed, that for a gene that encodes a protein, three sequential bases of the gene's DNA specify each successive amino acid of the protein.  Thus the genetic code is a triplet code, where each triplet (called a codon) specifies a particular amino acid.  They also obtained evidence that the codons do not overlap with each other in the DNA sequence encoding a protein, and that such a sequence is read from a fixed starting point."]}, {"page": "Index of biophysics articles", "response": ["*Leslie Barnett"]}, {"page": "Index of women scientists articles", "response": ["*Leslie Barnett"]}]}}
