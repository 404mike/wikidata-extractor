He was junior Health and Social Security Minister from 1969 to 1970, and became Minister of State for that department in 1974.\nO'Malley's crowning achievement was obtaining cross-party support for a new State pension scheme (after two aborted attempts by previous governments) and steering through Parliament the bill to implement what became the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS). While the Secretary of State Barbara Castle took public credit for it, O'Malley was responsible for its substance.\nO'Malley's career was cut short by his death in 1976 at the age of 46, following complications after brain surgery. Stanley Crowther was elected as his successor in the subsequent by-election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Brian O'Malley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Brian O'Malley"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*Brian O'Malley (1930\u20131976)"]}, {"page": "Rotherham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Brian O'Malley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Brian O'Malley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Brian O'Malley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Brian O'Malley"]}, {"page": "Labour government, 1964\u20131970", "response": ["|Brian O'Malley||1 April 1967 \u2013 13 October 1969||\u00a0", "|Brian O'Malley||13 October 1969 \u2013 19 June 1970||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Brian O'Malley", "|Brian O'Malley"]}, {"page": "Labour government, 1974\u20131979", "response": ["|rowspan=4|Minister of State, Health and Social Security||Brian O'Malley||8 March 1974 \u2013 6 April 1976||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "1976 Rotherham by-election", "response": ["The Rotherham by-election of 24 June 1976 was held after the death of Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Brian O'Malley.
