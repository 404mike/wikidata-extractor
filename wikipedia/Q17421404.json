The Brook House School opened in August 1860 with a small number of pupils. The school's approach was unusual in that the students were neither rewarded nor punished. Nevertheless, the students were allowed more freedom than was usually permitted in comparable schools. One of the people she employed was William Henry Herford. He was a Unitarian minister, but he was also a writer and educator. They had similar views on education and she eventually became his second wife when in her 50s."]}]}}
