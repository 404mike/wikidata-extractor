Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing.Hamilton, pp. 34\u201338 That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.Hamilton. p. 43"]}, {"page": "1902 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Warwick Armstrong, Cuthbert Burnup, James Iremonger, James Kelly, Victor Trumper"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  James Iremonger"]}, {"page": "Albert Hallam", "response": ["However, it was still a surprise how Hallam declined the following year.

Already forty years of age, it was clear Hallam was not going to recover his form as he had done at least twice before, and after bowling with very moderate success in the early games of 1910 he was left out of the Nottinghamshire eleven for James Iremonger to develop as a bowler.
