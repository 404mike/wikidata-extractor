He was the organiser (leader) of the Acrobat network (or circuit) which operated in Dijon. The purpose of SOE in occupied France was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.\nStarr was wounded and captured by the German SS on 18 July 1943 and imprisoned for the remainder of the war. After World War II, Starr was accused by several other SOE agents of collaboration with the Germans while he was a captive.

Within minutes two other agents, Cecily Lefort and Noor Inayat Khan, had landed. The three women, who had been sent to operate as couriers for the organizers of various circuits (also known as networks) in different parts of France, were met by a reception committee organized by F Sections' air movements officer, Henri D\u00e9ricourt, and quickly spirited to their destinations. Rowden was bound to the area of the Jura Mountains south-east of Dijon and just west of the Swiss border to work for the organizer of the Acrobat circuit, led by John Renshaw Starr. Her papers were in her cover name of Juliette Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Rondeau. Her name in the field among fellow agents was Paulette while her code name in messages to London was Chaplain.

After refusing to sign a declaration renouncing future escape attempts, Noor was taken to Germany on 27 November 1943 \"for safe custody\" and imprisoned at Pforzheim in solitary confinement as a \"Nacht und Nebel\" (\"Night and Fog\": condemned to \"Disappearance without Trace\") prisoner, in complete secrecy.
