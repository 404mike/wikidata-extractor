He took a while to find his feet at Edgar Street under manager John Charles but would soon become involved in arguably the greatest FA Cup shock of all time. Hereford met Newcastle United, of the First Division, in the Third Round at St James' Park and came away with a remarkable 2\u20132 draw. George was the substitute that day, played for the last 20 minutes and provided a cross that Meadows came within inches of converting. The replay at Edgar Street saw George named as the substitute again. When Malcolm Macdonald put Newcastle 1\u20130 up late in the game, George was brought on for the injured Roger Griffiths and played a key part in Hereford's triumph. He won possession on the left wing which ultimately led to Ronnie Radford's famous equalising goal. The game went into extra time and George's fresh legs paid dividends. Controlling a pass from Dudley Tyler on the edge of the area, he turned and shot into the bottom left hand corner of the goal, sparking a pitch invasion. Along with Ronnie Radford, George has become part of FA Cup folklore and his achievement is frequently referred to, particularly in the build-up to the FA Cup Third Round."]}, {"page": "List of Hereford United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|Dudley Tyler"]}, {"page": "Hereford United 2\u20131 Newcastle United", "response": ["Almost immediately Newcastle were on the attack as Macdonald latched onto a misdirected header from Ronnie Radford and broke into the Hereford penalty area.
