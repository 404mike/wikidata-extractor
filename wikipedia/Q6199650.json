At the end of the decade he was appointed at a relatively young age, consultant psychiatrist and depute physician superintendent at Stratheden Hospital, Cupar in Fife. The hospital had been an old-style asylum, but he pursued his vision of creating a department of Child and Family Psychiatry which he succeeded in doing in 1960 in a designated unit called, 'Playfield House' in the hospital grounds. This became a base for out-reach child and family services in Glenrothes and Kirkcaldy and other areas in the Kingdom of Fife. He believed in involving children's domestic and educational settings and persuaded colleagues from other disciplines to explore new avenues of treatment. One of his notable recruits was the artist, Joyce Laing, who was instrumental in the rehabilitation of a convicted 'lifer' at Barlinnie prison, Jimmy Boyle. Haldane managed to persuade Fife Health Board to build two family residential units in the grounds of Stratheden which he achieved by 1975.Clulow, C. and McCluskey, U.
