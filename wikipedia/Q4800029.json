He began under Professor Arthur Prince Chattock and when Chattock retired at age 50 in 1910 Tyndall became acting head of the Physics Department. At the start of World War I he left Bristol for Hampshire, England to head an army radiological department. This assignment was short lived, as he was called back to Bristol and resume leadership of the Physics Department. In 1916 Tyndall met Henry Herbert Wills, Pro-Chancellor and special buildings committee chairman and the ensuing friendship led to the physics laboratory for the University of Bristol. In March 1919 a gift of \u00a3200,000 over a period of 2 years was provided and upon H.H. Wills\u2019 death additional sums were bestowed for the University\u2019s building fund and endowment.
