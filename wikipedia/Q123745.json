On leaving the RAF he obtained a job with British Transport Films (BTF), filming all forms of transportation.After this, it was to Iraq (where he later shot the opening scenes to The Exorcist, 1973), filming for the Iraq Petroleum Company. At this time he owned his own Arriflex camera. He spent several years in documentary work, hoping that one day he could break into features.\nBefore his feature debut, he became a cameraman on commercials, where he made contact with future directors Ken Russell and John Schlesinger (who had directed for BTF as well). In 1965, he shot his first feature as director of photography (San Ferry Ann), having by-passed the focus puller and operator stages.  He made several others before shooting Billion Dollar Brain with Russell in 1967.Williams can be seen in a cameo in the film The Wind and the Lion (1975), playing a British nobleman living in Tangier who is killed in a shootout with Sean Connery's Berber tribesmen. He also appeared with Cher in 1987's Suspect.\nWilliams retired on New Year's Day 1996. Since retirement he has travelled, conducting workshops on film.
