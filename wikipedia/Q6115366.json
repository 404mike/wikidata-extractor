Benny Goodman was among the five artists to record the song in 1936, and it has been widely covered since - by Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk and Bryan Ferry among others.  Under the title \"Ces Petites Choses\", it was also a hit in France for Dorothy Dickson. Strachey scored another success in 1940 (this time with Eric Maschwitz and Manning Sherwin) with the song \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\".\nIn the 1940s Strachey began to compose popular light music pieces for orchestra, and is best remembered in Britain as the composer of \"Theatreland\", \"Pink Champagne\", and especially \"In Party Mood\" (1944), which was the signature tune of Housewives' Choice, a popular radio show on the BBC Light Programme which ran until 1967.\nJack Strachey moved to Brighton in 1958 and died there on 27 May 1972.", "link_mentions": {}}}
