His best-known screen roles are those of Tony in Mike Leigh's Abigail's Party and DI Roy Galloway in The Bill from 1984 to 1987. He has also appeared in \"Coronation Street\" (1977) I Didn't Know You Cared, EastEnders, Miracles Take Longer and in films such as A Bridge Too Far (1977), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), An American Werewolf in London (1981), Give My Regards to Broad Street (1984) and Prick Up Your Ears (1987). \nSalthouse had previously been a professional footballer until injury had forced him to retire. He had played for Crystal Palace under the name of John Lewis in the 1960s, a fact which he drew on in playing the sullen Tony in Abigail's Party. He also appeared in the early series of the Sky One soap opera Dream Team as the club's academy coach, Frank Patcham. He appeared in Series 1 and Series 2, and later became one of the show's producers. For the penultimate episode, Salthouse made a cameo appearance offering a young Jason Porter a contract with Harchester United.\nIn 1997 he played Richard Ealham in the eighth episode of the seventh series of Heartbeat.\nHe appeared as a guest actor in an episode of Silk broadcast on Tuesday 5 June 2012, and played DCI Sid Bradbery in The Great Train Robbery, broadcast on BBC1 in December 2013.\nIn 2020, he gave a rare in-depth interview about his time on The Bill and his career in general for the book 'Witness Statements'", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1984 in film", "response": ["| Give My Regards to Broad Street || 20th Century Fox / MPL Communications || Peter Webb (director); Paul McCartney (screenplay); Paul McCartney, Bryan Brown, Ringo Starr, Barbara Bach, Linda McCartney, Philip Jackson, Giant Haystacks, Tracey Ullman, Ralph Richardson, George Martin, John Bennett, John Burgess, Ian Hastings, Marie Collett, Graham Dene, Anthony Bate, Leonard Fenton, Jeremy Child, John Salthouse, John Paul Jones, Eric Stewart, Jeffrey Daniel || Musical, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Abigail's Party", "response": ["The original production starred Alison Steadman as Beverly, and Tim Stern as her husband Laurence.

John Salthouse brought his early career as a footballer with Crystal Palace to that of Tony. According to Leigh, discussions at the improvised sessions included whether Beverly's name should have a third \"e\" or not. The most complex relationship was worked out between Angela and Tony. Little of this is disclosed during the narrative, although something of it becomes apparent when Angela steps in to care first for Sue, then the stricken Laurence, and the centre of power between the couple starts to shift noticeably."]}, {"page": "Crystal Palace F.C.", "response": ["The club also enjoys a sizeable celebrity support. Kevin Day and Jo Brand host an annual comedy night for Comic Relief and the Palace Academy, and fellow comedians Eddie Izzard and Mark Steel are also staunch Palace fans. The actor Neil Morrissey developed Palace Ale, a beer on sale in the ground, while actor Bill Nighy is patron of the Crystal Palace Children's Charity (CPSCC). Radio DJ David Jensen is chairman of the Crystal Palace Vice Presidents Club, and acted as spokesman for the CPFC 2010 consortium during their takeover bid for the club. Actor, writer and producer John Salthouse was on the books of Palace as a player from 1968 to 1970 under the name of John Lewis, and was also a mascot for the club as a child. He incorporated the club into his role as Tony in Abigail's Party.

In the Mike Leigh play Abigail's Party, the character Tony mentions that he used to play professionally for Crystal Palace but it \"didn't work out\", something actor John Salthouse brought to the character in rehearsals based on his own life. Salthouse also incorporated the club into the children's television series he wrote, Hero to Zero, in which the father of the main character once played for Palace reserves. In the first series of Only Fools and Horses, a Crystal Palace scarf could be seen on the coat rack, placed there by producer Ray Butt, even though Rodney's middle name was Charlton, as Del revealed on Rodney's wedding day: their mother was a fan of \"Athletic\" not \"Heston\". Headmaster Keith Blackwell, who played Palace mascot \"Pete the Eagle\" in the late nineties, fronted a series of Coca-Cola advertisements in 1996.
