He had one recorded son, Coenberht, the father of King Caedwalla of Wessex.\nHis name is related to that of St Chad of Mercia (spelt Ceadda in Bede's Ecclesiastical History) and is derived from the Brythonic (British Celtic) root 'cat' or 'cad' meaning \"battle.\"  It is one of a number of apparently Celtic names found in the West Saxon ruling family, including that of Cedda's grandson Caedwalla.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "590", "response": ["* Cedda, prince of Wessex (approximate date)"]}, {"page": "Cerdic of Wessex", "response": ["The name Cerdic is thought by most scholars to be Brittonic\u00a0\u2013 a form of the name Ceretic \u2013 rather than Germanic in origin.
