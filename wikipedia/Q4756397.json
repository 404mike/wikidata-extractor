The philosopher Charles Taylor has described his work on music as \"excellent and densely argued\".He has translated the works of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Friedrich Schleiermacher. His recent work has focused on music and philosophy, and Adorno on the nature of philosophy. In addition to his philosophical work on music, he is a keen jazz saxophonist and has played with leading contemporary jazz musicians such as \nAl Casey and Humphrey Lyttelton.He did his doctoral research on \"History and the Novel\" (1980) at the University of East Anglia, where he was taught by the renowned German writer and scholar W.

Schopenhauer believed that what distinguished aesthetic experiences from other experiences is that contemplation of the object of aesthetic appreciation temporarily allowed the subject a respite from the strife of desire, and allowed the subject to enter a realm of purely mental enjoyment, the world purely as representation or mental image.  The more a person's mind is concerned with the world as representation, the less it feels the suffering of the world as will.\"Schopenhauer...regards art as the only means of temporarily escaping the fundamentally futile nature of reality. Art's essential role is...to enable us to escape what we already intuitively know about the irredeemable nature of what we are.\" (Andrew Bowie, Aesthetics and subjectivity: from Kant to Nietzsche, Chapter 8, \"Nietzsche and the fate of Romantic thought,\" \"Schopenhauer: music as metaphysics,\" Manchester University Press, 2003, Page 262.)
