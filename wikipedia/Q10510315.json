Watford joined the newly formed Football League Division Three in 1920, and Kent led the club to a 6th-placed finish. Struggling in the 1920\u201321 season, Kent was allocated the fee from the sale of Frank Hoddinott to sign a player that would drive the club up the league. That was Fred Pagnam signed for \u00a31000 - by far a club record fee. In 1922 Watford moved to their new ground, Vicarage Road."]}, {"page": "George Lennon (footballer)", "response": ["Lennon was born in Kilwinning and began his football career with local junior side Kilwinning Rangers. He then played in the Scottish Football League for Third Lanark, Forfar Athletic, Abercorn, St Mirren and Ayr United before joining Luton Town in 1920. He spent three seasons with the \"Hatters\" making 115 appearances which earned him a move to Stoke in March 1923. He was never fully given a chance as the manager who brought him to the club Arthur Shallcross was sacked in April 1923 and his replacement Jock Rutherford left the club after just four weeks. Tom Mather was appointed Stoke manager in October 1924 and gave Lennon his chance to impress at full back in a match away at Crystal Palace. But he was \"ran ragged\" by Palace's Welsh international Frank Hoddinott who got a hat-trick as Stoke lost 5\u20131."]}, {"page": "Frank Hoddinnott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Hoddinott"]}, {"page": "Francis Hoddinott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Hoddinott"]}, {"page": "Frank Hodinott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Hoddinott"]}, {"page": "Hoddinott", "response": ["*Frank Hoddinott (1894\u20131980), Welsh association footballer"]}, {"page": "Tom Hoddinott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Hoddinott"]}]}}
