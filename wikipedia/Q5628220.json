However, this started to change in the first decade of the 20th century, in the penultimate decade of Imperial Russian rule, when the city grew and altered dramatically.

The demographics of the region changed because of a series of wars between the Ottoman Empire, Iran and Russia. By the early 19th century, Yerevan had a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century.

Originally standing  high, it was Ani's second tallest structure after Gagikashen of 50m high. It is very large by the standards of Armenian architecture. Architecture historian Murad Hasratyan suggests that its relatively large size and rich ornaments symbolize the revived Armenian statehood under the Bagratids. Christina Maranci suggested what she describes as an \"extremely tentative\" hypothesis that the relatively large proportion of the cathedral may have been a \"reflection of Trdat's memory of the vast continuous spaces\" of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the dome of which he repaired. However, it is considered small if judged by a European standard, wrote H. F. B. Lynch and added, \"it is nevertheless a stately building. It bears the imprint of that undefinable quality, beauty, and can scarcely fail to arouse a thrill of delight in the spectator.\" Luigi Villari wrote in his 1906 book on travels in the Caucasus: \"From a distance it seems to be merely a plain rectangular structure with no architectural pretensions. But on closer inspection it proves to be a building of really great beauty and of the most perfect proportions.\"", "The cathedral is widely considered a masterpiece of Armenian architecture. It is the largest and most impressive structure of Ani. Armen Kazaryan describes it as the most significant structure of the entire Bagratid period. The cathedral is known for its novel design features. Authors of Global History of Architecture wrote that it \"deserves to be listed among the principal monuments of the time because of its pointed arches and clustered columns and piers.\" Josef Strzygowski argued that the cathedral is the most valuable achievement of Armenian architecture from the European viewpoint. David Marshall Lang wrote that the cathedral's building techniques are \"far ahead of the contemporary Anglo-Saxon and Norman architecture of western Europe.\" H. F. B. Lynch wrote: \"The impression which we take away from our survey of these various features is that we have been introduced to a monument of the highest artistic merit, denoting a standard of culture which was far in advance of the contemporary standards in the West.\" Sirarpie Der Nersessian wrote that it \"deserves to be listed among the important examples of medieval architecture.\" The New International Encyclopedia characterized it as the \"most interesting church of Armenia.\" David Roden Buxton suggested that the cathedral deserves far more fame than it actually has. Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers wrote in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911):", "Some European scholars, especially scholars of the Near East, have suggested that the use of pointed arches and clustered piers in the cathedral influenced the development of Gothic architecture. The theory was popularized by Josef Strzygowski, who was the first European to thoroughly study Armenian architecture and placed Armenia in the center of European architecture. Reprint of the 1934 ed. published by the Cambridge University Press, pp. 74, 98 Strzygowski wrote in the Origin of Christian Church Art (1920): \"It is a delight, in a church earlier than AD 1000, to see the builder, the court architect Trdat, carrying Armenian art so logically and so successfully past 'Romanesque' to 'Gothic'.\" Several scholars had proposed this view before Strzygowski. H. F. B. Lynch in his book on Armenia published in 1901 suggested that the cathedral has \"many of the characteristics of the Gothic style, of which it establishes the Oriental origin.\" William Lethaby found the cathedral \"strangely western.\" He wrote in Medieval Art (1912) that it is especially remarkable because its pointed arches, clustered piers, ribs and colonnades correspond to the Gothic of a hundred years later. Edith Browne wrote in 1912 that the cathedral is \"a very specimen of transition to the Gothic style.\"", "File:Lynch Ani Cathedral.png|A photo of the cathedral published in a 1901 book by H. F. B.
