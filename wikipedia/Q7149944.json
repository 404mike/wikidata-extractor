A former soldier with the Royal Artillery between 1980 and 1987, he has since worked extensively as a journalist in combat zones, producing footage from conflicts in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Libya. In 2011, he was shortlisted for the PRX Bayeux TV report along with Marie Colvin, a war correspondent with The Sunday Times.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kerry and Kay Danes", "response": ["In 2013, the producers of The Bodhi Tree film considered buying an option on Kay Danes' 2009 memoir Standing Ground: An Imprisoned Couple's Struggle for Justice Against a Communist Regime but later decided to base the film on two novels by British journalist Paul Conroy. The Bodhi Tree concentrates on the main story of lawyer Max Green, Australia's biggest legal fraudster, who embezzled millions of dollars and was later murdered in Cambodia. The smaller supporting story fictionalises the Danes in Laos."]}, {"page": "Jamie Dornan", "response": ["He began acting in 2006, and earned international recognition for playing Sheriff Graham Humbert in the series Once Upon a Time (2011\u20132013) and serial killer Paul Spector in the crime drama series The Fall (2013\u20132016). For the latter, he won the Irish Film and Television Award for Best Actor in Television and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. In film, he has portrayed Axel von Fersen in Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006), Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades franchise (2015\u20132018), Jan Kubi\u0161 in Anthropoid (2016), Commandant Pat Quinlan in The Siege of Jadotville (2016), Paul Conroy in A Private War (2018), and Pa in Belfast (2021). For his acclaimed performance in the last he received nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture .", "In 2018, Dornan portrayed journalist Paul Conroy in the biographical drama A Private War. Ann Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post, described Dornan's performance as \"a gallantly self-effacing performance\". Kenneth Turan for Los Angeles Times described Dornan's performance as \"excellent work from the Fifty Shades veteran\". In the same year, he appeared as Will Scarlet in Robin Hood and as Nick, a doctor and memoirist, in Untogether."]}, {"page": "Avaaz", "response": ["Avaaz supported the civil uprising preceding the Syrian Civil War. This included sending $1.5 million of Internet communications equipment to protesters, and training activists. Later it used smuggling routes to send over $2 million of medical equipment into rebel-held areas of Syria.  It also smuggled 34 international journalists into Syria. Avaaz coordinated the evacuation of wounded British photographer Paul Conroy from Homs. Thirteen Syrian activists died during the evacuation operation. Some senior members of other non-governmental organizations working in the Middle East have criticized Avaaz for taking sides in a civil war. As of November 2016, Avaaz continues campaigning for no-fly zones over Syria in general and specifically Aleppo.  (Gen. Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, has said that establishing a no-fly zone means going to war against Syria and Russia.)  It has received criticism from parts of the political blogosphere and has a single digit percentage of its users opposing the petitions, with a number of users ultimately leaving the network. The Avaaz team responded to this criticism by issuing two statements defending their decision to campaign.", "Some question whether Avaaz's focus on online petitions and email campaigns may encourage laziness, transforming potential activism into clicktivism. Malcolm Gladwell says that petition tools do not create \"close-knit, disciplined and tenacious\" networks of activists. In February 2012, Avaaz raised money for the evacuation of Paul Conroy from Syria, a mission that led to the deaths of 13 activists in Syria. A New Republic article accused Avaaz of making false claims about their own role in the evacuation. Jillian York has accused Avaaz of arrogance and lack of transparency. The Defensor Da Natureza blog has accused Avaaz of taking credit for the success of the Ficha Limpa anti-corruption bill in Brazil, which Luis Nassif reposted."]}, {"page": "International reactions to the Syrian civil war", "response": ["Avaaz helped to coordinate the entry of 34 international journalists into Syrian war zones, including photographer R\u00e9mi Ochlik and journalist Marie Colvin, who both died during the siege of Homs and reporter Edith Bouvier, who was badly hurt. To help evacuate photographer Paul Conroy from the city of Homs on 28 February, the group co-ordinated an operation by Syrian activists and also evacuated 40 seriously wounded people from Baba Amr and brought in medical supplies. Avaaz set up a network of about 200 activists to provide video footage, which has been used by the international media."]}, {"page": "Siege of Homs", "response": ["On 22 February 2012, American journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer R\u00e9mi Ochlik were killed when a rocket hit their safe house. Another photographer, Paul Conroy, and French journalist Edith Bouvier of Le Figaro were also injured during the attack. The day before her death, Colvin had spoken to CNN and others of the \"absolutely sickening\" indiscriminate attacks on civilians by government forces. It was speculated that the journalists were targeted. The editor of The Sunday Times also said he believed Colvin had been targeted. French president Nicolas Sarkozy described the killing as \"assassination\".", "The injured British photo-journalist, Paul Conroy, was successfully smuggled into Lebanon by the FSA's Farouq Brigades and volunteers who were local Baba Amr activists. Avaaz claimed that this rescue attempt cost the lives of between 13 and 23 volunteers, out of the 35 that Avaaz sent, though this claim was later disputed by Paul Conroy in his 2013 book Under the Wire. Conroy states that Avaaz charged reporters R\u00e9mi Ochlik and Edith Bouvier $3000 to enter Baba Amr a week prior, using the same route and tunnel that he used to escape. Avaaz's Ricken Patel later put the volunteer death toll at 23 deaths out of 50 people.", "The Syrian Army's capture of the Baba Amr stronghold provoked multiple reactions from analysts and officials. Taleb Ibrahim, an analyst close to the Syrian government, commented that it was the beginning of the end of Homs' armed opposition. Ayham Kamel, a Middle East analyst, observed that the Syrian Army used the capture of Baba Amr to send the message that it was still the dominant force on the battlefield, noting that the stronghold was a significant base for the organization and weapons supply hub for the rebels. British journalist Paul Conroy, who escaped the city a few days prior, described the situation as an \"indiscriminate massacre\" and \"slaughter\" and compared the siege to the Battle of Grozny."]}, {"page": "Marie Colvin", "response": ["Colvin died on February 22, alongside photojournalist R\u00e9mi Ochlik. An autopsy conducted in Damascus by the Syrian government concluded Marie Colvin was killed by an \"improvised explosive device filled with nails.\" The Syrian government claims the explosive device was planted by terrorists on February 22, 2012, while fleeing an unofficial media building which was being shelled by the Syrian Army. This account was rejected by photographer Paul Conroy, who was with Colvin and Ochlik and survived the attack. Conroy recalled that Colvin and Ochlik were packing their gear when Syrian artillery fire hit their media centre."]}, {"page": "Paul Conroy", "response": ["Paul Conroy may refer to:", "*Paul Conroy (music executive), a UK music executive", "*Paul Conroy (Gaelic footballer), Gaelic footballer who plays for Galway", "*Paul Conroy (journalist), British press photographer working for The Sunday Times who was injured during the 2012 Siege of Homs"]}, {"page": "Ali Mahmoud Othman", "response": ["Paul Conroy said Othman \"was one of the activists who just made things happen at the media centre.
