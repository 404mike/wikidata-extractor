Together with his father, George Brettingham Sowerby I, he published the Thesaurus Conchyliorum and other illustrated works on molluscs. He was an elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society on 7 May 1844. He was the father  of George Brettingham Sowerby III, also a malacologist.\n\nHe died on the 26th July 1884 and is buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery with his father George Brettingham Sowerby I and sister Charlotte Caroline Sowerby.\nThe shell craze was further hyped with the publication of British Conchology, a five volume set of books written by the lawyer John Gwyn Jeffreys (1809\u20131885) and which managed to combine scientific exactitude with delicate, informative historical commentary. Published between 1862 and 1869, and beautifully illustrated by the conchological artist George Sowerby (1812\u20131884), British Conchology would not be bettered during the Victorian era and it remains a usable and readable resource to this day.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sowerby family", "response": ["***George Brettingham Sowerby II (1812\u20131884)", "****George Brettingham Sowerby III (1843\u20131921)"]}, {"page": "George Brettingham Sowerby I", "response": ["He was the second son of James Sowerby.

He published about 50 papers on molluscs and started several comprehensive, illustrated books on the subject, the most important the Thesaurus Conchyliorum, a work that was continued by his son, George Brettingham Sowerby II and his grandson George Brettingham Sowerby III. One of his first works was the cataloguing of the collection of the Earl of Tankerville.
