He is currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), as well as working on the international independent circuit. He is also known for his six-year tenure in WWE from 2012 to 2018, where he competed under the ring name Neville (shortened from his original ring name Adrian Neville).\nSatterley is noted for his high-flying style and aerial attacks, which has earned him the nickname \"The Man That Gravity Forgot\". He began his wrestling career under the ring name Pac in North East England with a small promotion, the Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF), and after establishing himself in the United Kingdom with promotions such as Real Quality Wrestling and One Pro Wrestling, he began to perform overseas, most notably for the United States-based Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), Ring of Honor (ROH), and Chikara, as well as the Japan-based Dragon Gate, where he won the Open the Brave, Triangle, and Twin Gate Championship. He is a former PWG World Tag Team Champion and winner of PWG's inaugural Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament.\nFrom 2012 to 2015, Neville wrestled in NXT, WWE's developmental territory. He won the NXT Tag Team Championship twice, with his first reign being as one half of the inaugural champions with Oliver Grey and the other reign with Corey Graves. He is also a one-time NXT Champion, making him the first man to have held both the NXT Championship and the NXT Tag Team Championship. Neville was promoted to the main roster in early 2015. He began competing in the cruiserweight division in December 2016, and became a record two-time and longest-reigning WWE Cruiserweight Champion, which also made him the only wrestler to have held both the NXT and WWE Cruiserweight Championships.After leaving WWE in 2018, Satterley reverted to his previous ring name of Pac and returned to Dragon Gate, where he was the Open the Dream Gate Champion for much of his time there and a former member of the villainous R.E.D. stable. In 2019, he left Dragon Gate and signed with AEW, where he became the leader of the Death Triangle trio alongside the AEW World Tag-Team Champions, The Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Rey Fenix).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Jericho", "response": ["In January 2015, Jericho revealed that he signed an exclusive WWE contract, under which he would compete at 16 house shows only. He later signed a similar contract once the former expired and competed at house shows throughout the rest of 2015. During this time he wrestled against the likes of Luke Harper, Kevin Owens and King Barrett in winning efforts. In May 2015, Jericho was one of the hosts of Tough Enough's sixth season. Jericho also hosted two Live! With Chris Jericho specials on the WWE Network during 2015; his guests were John Cena and Stephanie McMahon. Jericho made his televised return at The Beast in the East, defeating Neville. At Night of Champions, Jericho was revealed as the mystery partner of Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose, facing The Wyatt Family in a losing effort. On October 3, Jericho unsuccessfully challenged Kevin Owens for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Live from Madison Square Garden. The match marked 20 years since Jericho's debut with ECW while also celebrating his 25th year as a professional wrestler in total.", "Jericho then entered a feud with Enzo and Cass and on the August 1 episode of Raw, he teamed with Charlotte to defeat Enzo Amore and then WWE Women's Champion Sasha Banks in a mixed tag team match, after which Big Cass made the save as Jericho continued the assault on Amore. The following week on Raw, Jericho allied with Kevin Owens and later defeated Amore via disqualification when Cass interfered. This led to a tag team match at SummerSlam, where Jericho and Owens defeated Enzo and Cass. On the August 22 episode of Raw, Jericho interfered in Owens's match against Neville, allowing him to qualify for the fatal four-way match to determine the new WWE Universal Champion on the August 29 episode of Raw, which Owens won."]}, {"page": "Dustin Rhodes", "response": ["Goldust returned from injury at Survivor Series, competing in a 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match during the pre-show, teaming with The Dudley Boyz, Neville and Titus O'Neil, where they defeated the team of Stardust, The Ascension, The Miz and Bo Dallas. Goldust would continue feuding with his brother, Stardust, on Raw and SmackDown during the months of November and December. On the December 17 episode of SmackDown, Goldust would cost Tyler Breeze his match against O'Neil after distracting Breeze by appearing at ringside.

When Regal later saved Derrick Bateman from Ohno's post-match attack, Ohno confronted Regal, who punched Ohno. The next week, Regal apologised to Ohno. In reply, Ohno stated that he had followed in Regal's footsteps to arrive in WWE, but that Regal's whole career had no legacy, leading to Regal punching Ohno again. After both men continued to attack each other, the rivalry culminated in a match on 10 April 2013 episode of NXT, which Regal won. Ohno later apologised to Regal. On 26 June episode of NXT, Regal tried to help Ohno, Adrian Neville and Corey Graves from a joint assault by The Wyatt Family, Garrett Dylan and Scott Dawson, but was overwhelmed. Two weeks later, Graves, Neville and Regal faced The Wyatt Family with Bray Wyatt pinning Regal."]}, {"page": "Ladder match", "response": ["|Adrian Neville defeated Bo Dallas (c)", "|Adrian Neville"]}]}}
