As head of department, alongside his friend Dr E. F. Schumacher and through the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, Peter Dunn was on the first committees working with Intermediate Technology or Appropriate Technology.  These committees led to the formation of the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now Practical Action).  He encouraged the Departmental research group to contribute to the developing sectors of intermediate technology.\nPeter Dunn started the world's first Master of Science Degrees in Renewable Energy in 1977.
