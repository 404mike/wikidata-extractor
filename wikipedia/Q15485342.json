In the early 1960s, Pegg moved on to the jazz scene playing with pianist Duncan Swift. He was with Ken Rattenbury and his Band during the 1960s and played alongside Bill Rank during 1968. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pegg was into the more contemporary folk / rock style that was in vogue at the time. It was in this period  at his studio in Kinver, that he recorded songs with Clifford T. Ward, immediately before Clifford was signed to the Dandelion label of which John Peel was a co-owner. He has recorded songs by Dave Cartwright and also John Richards, with whom he co-wrote \"Did You Like The Battle Sir?\".
