He was also critical of econometricians arguing that: they are not, it seems to me, engaged in forging tools to arrange and measure actual facts so much as making a marvellous array of pretend-tools which would perform wonders if ever a set of facts should turn up in the right form. Thus what was said above about the detached mathematical nature of much economic theory also goes for some econometric theory as well. But he counterbalances these criticisms by arguing that econometrics has been a powerful force in bringing economic theory back into touch with reality.", "link_mentions": []}}
