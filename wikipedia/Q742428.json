Silas' story in the film is similar to that in the novel, except for a few minor aspects. Instead of murdering his father for killing his mother, Silas stabs his father on the shoulder for attacking her. After this, his wounded and terrified father screams to him that \"you are a ghost\" (\"Eres un fantasma...!!!\"), referring to his albinism. His age during these events is set in Silas's late teens, instead of the age of seven as it happened in the book. He is also portrayed to have killed two assailants who were attacking Aringarosa.  Also, in the novel Silas knows that Remy is the Teacher's minion, but in the film he is tricked into believing that Remy is the Teacher. His death is also slightly different. After realizing he had just shot Aringarosa, Silas collapses in anguish and remorse. He then raises his gun and is shot down by the police, his last words being \"Soy un fantasma...\" (\"I am a ghost...\"). Also, in the novel, Silas' nationality is French: he tells Aringarosa that he does not speak Spanish. In the film, Silas is Spanish (presumably Basque) and speaks several lines of Spanish."]}, {"page": "Henry VIII (TV serial)", "response": ["* Hugh Mitchell as Edward VI of England"]}, {"page": "Cultural depictions of Edward VI of England", "response": ["*Hugh Mitchell in the Granada Television serial Henry VIII (2003), with Ray Winstone as Henry"]}, {"page": "List of British former child actors", "response": ["*Hugh Mitchell (born 1989)"]}, {"page": "Tormented (2009 British film)", "response": ["* Hugh Mitchell as Tim", "On 5 January 2009, it was announced that Jon Wright would direct a 2009 British comedy horror and slasher film titled Tormented which would be released in cinemas on 22 May 2009 in the UK.
