In 1837, upon the death of William IV and the announcement of a general election, a requisition signed by over 2,500 county freeholders sought the election of two alternative Whig candidates. On the day of the election, freeholders flocked from every part of the division to offer support for the reform candidates. The cavalcade of horsemen, four abreast, many of whom had ridden many miles that morning, stretched over half a mile. Flags and banner, advertising the disapproval of Graham, flew profusely, many of them bearing skits relating to Graham's past conduct. On the hustings, Graham found it difficult to obtain a hearing, and in consequence he submitted to his opponents' cries. At the close of the poll the numbers were: for Francis Aglionby 2,294; for William James 2,124; for Graham 1,505. This ended Graham's influence in his home county."]}, {"page": "List of slave owners", "response": ["*William James (1791\u20131861), English Radical politician and owner of a West Indies plantation."]}, {"page": "Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|William James ||rowspan=\"2\"|Radical", "|William James ||Radical"]}, {"page": "William James (disambiguation)", "response": ["William James (1842\u20131910) was a pioneering American psychologist and philosopher.", "William James may also refer to:", "* William James (Royal Navy admiral) (1881\u20131974), British admiral", "* William James (Australian general) (1930\u20132015), Australian Army general", "* Sir William James, 1st Baronet (1721\u20131783), East India Company navy commander and director, Member of Parliament for West Looe 1774\u20131783", "* William James (Carlisle MP) (1791\u20131861), Member of Parliament for Carlisle 1820\u20131826", "* William James (MP for Kent), Member of Parliament for Kent, 1654\u201359", "* William James (cricketer) (1858\u2013?), English cricketer", "* William James (rugby league), rugby league footballer in the 1920s and 1930s", "* William James (American football) (born 1979), American footballer", "* William James (bowls) (born 1969), Swaziland lawn bowler", "* William James (bishop) (1542\u20131617), English academic and bishop of Durham, 1606\u201317", "* William James (slave trader) (1735-1798), operating out of the Port of Liverpool", "* William James (railway promoter) (1771\u20131837), British", "* William James (naval historian) (1780\u20131827), British naval historian during the Age of Sail", "* William James (engineer) (1854\u20131889), British engineer", "* William James (photographer) (1866\u20131948), British-Canadian photographer"]}, {"page": "East Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| William James || rowspan=\"3\"| Radical"]}, {"page": "Charles Howard (British politician)", "response": ["He was elected to the House of Commons as one of two representatives for Cumberland East at a by-election in 1840, a seat he held until his death in 1879.

He was active in the years between 1758 and 1778 from the Port of Liverpool.", "William James owned enslaved people on three plantations in Jamaica: Cambridge Pen, Clifton Hill, and Malborough Mount.", "William James was the grandfather of a 19th century member of parliament for Carlisle, who was also called William James. William James (the slave trader) left his grandson plantations with their enslaved people and financial wealth in his will.", "William James was one of the biggest slave traders of his era. He operated out of the Port of Liverpool and was well known amongst the sailors, ship builders and the many tradespeople working at the docks. In August 1775 a large scale sailors' riot broke out in Liverpool. A number of sailors had been employed to fit out the rigging for a ship called Derby. The owners refused to pay the full amount contracted, on the basis that there were so many unemployed sailors currently at the dock. The sailors were angered, they returned to the Derby and cut the rigging down, resulting in a number of them being arrested. 2,000 sailors armed with spikes and clubs broke them out of jail. The sailors then returned to Liverpool docks and cut the rigging of all of the ships ready to set sail. James at one time owned 29 ships at the port.", "The owners of the Derby agreed to pay the wages due and the sailors spent the rest of the day drinking alcohol and celebrating. The sailors then heard that there was a bounty on the leaders of the rioters, so they broke into a gun shop and stole 300 muskets and took cannons from the docks. They then went to Liverpool Town Hall, which housed the Liverpool Exchange on the ground floor and the Town Hall upstairs. The sailors spent most of the day shooting the cannons and muskets at the building, causing carnage. An eyewitness wrote the people were petrified and described the fear on the faces of the merchants in the town. The sailors marched on the dock merchant's homes to exact revenge. William James, had been forewarned and fearing for his life left Liverpool to stay at his country retreat. He took his family, servants and valuables but left a sole African boy who was found hiding in a clock. The sailors ransacked his home, breaking the crockery, shredding his fine bedding, drinking or pouring away the liquor in his cellar, destroying his compting house and destroying his furniture. The riot was eventually quelled by a troop of light horse guards from Manchester. At least 7 people died and dozens were injured. In April 1776, 14 of the rioters were transported to America as punishment. Gomer Williams writes \"the annals of the eighteenth century probably cannot mention a more extraordinary and formidable popular outbreak in England than these riots, arising from the greed of slave-merchants and the ferocity of their hirelings, and in which cannon, muskets, pistols, cutlasses and other deadly weapons were freely used by the mob."]}]}}
