Carswell) described the books as \"magnificent\", but some reviewers were animated by their own feuds with Namier and felt that the books had been limited by their determination to profile MPs individually rather than collectively. A. J. P. Taylor was the most quoted critic, writing in The Observer that the books were not a history but undigested raw material for one, and that many of the MPs profiled were of no importance in their own day. The 1715\u20131754 section was praised by J. C. D. Clark, who wrote of \"Cruickshanks' pioneering work on the Tories\" that demonstrated that the Tory party survived well into the eighteenth century and was heavily involved in Jacobitism. The introductory surveys to the 1558\u20131603 and 1660\u20131690 sections were criticised for being too brief. However, the more recent publications of 1790\u20131820, 1386\u20131421 and 1690\u20131715 (which have been longer) have been widely praised."]}, {"page": "Donald Carswell", "response": ["Donald Carswell (11 February 1882 \u2013 2 January 1940)The University of Glasgow Story  Donald Carswell, University of Glasgow was a Scottish barrister, journalist and author.
