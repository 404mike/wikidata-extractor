The following year under the redistribution and expansion of Northern Ireland's constituencies his local political base became part of the new Lagan Valley constituency which he has contested in the Alliance interest in all elections since 1983 apart from the 1986 by-election called in protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement when the local Alliance branch declined to contest the seat as they believed the by-election was a political stunt.\nClose also held several positions in the Alliance, including serving as Chair between 1981 and 1982 and as Deputy Leader from 1991 until 2001. He was often a member of the key Alliance delegations in successive talks about the future of the province, culminating in the Belfast Agreement of 1998.\nIn the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum, Close stood at the head of the Alliance's list for Lagan Valley but the party failed to secure enough votes to win one of the local seats. Close was also included on the province-wide list and as the most senior Alliance member to not be elected locally he won one of Alliance's two seats. In the 1998 election for the new Northern Ireland Assembly he topped the poll in Lagan Valley and gained a further personal triumph in the 2001 general election when he had the highest vote share of any Alliance candidate.\nIn June 2001, he resigned as Deputy Leader of the party, citing differences with the leadership of Se\u00e1n Neeson. Close has remained a member of the Assembly and successfully held his seat in the 2003 Assembly election.\nIn July 2005, Mr Close proposed that the Lisburn Council deny gay couples access to the council's designated wedding facility if they were seeking a civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act 2004. The council adopted his recommendation to the great annoyance of many liberal campaigners.  This ran against Alliance policy, which had been strongly supportive of the introduction of civil partnership laws, and he was publicly criticised by other senior party members.In November 2006, Close announced that he was retiring from politics In the 2007 election he was succeeded as Alliance Party Lagan Valley Assembly representative by the then Mayor of Lisburn, Councillor Trevor Lunn.Close was succeeded as Mayor of Lisburn by Harry Lewis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alliance Party of Northern Ireland", "response": ["| Seamus Close"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 2nd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Seamus Close", "|Seamus Close"]}, {"page": "Lisburn City Council", "response": ["* 1993 \u2013 94: Seamus Close, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "Se\u00e1n Neeson", "response": ["The following year the 2001 general election saw a number of misfortunes for Alliance and Neeson personally. He failed to be selected to fight his own constituency by his local association.

Subsequently, Alliance took the controversial decision to withdraw from several constituencies which looked likely to be fierce contests between the Ulster Unionists and/or the SDLP against the Democratic Unionists and/or Sinn F\u00e9in, instead urging voters to support the pro Agreement candidate best placed for peace. The party lost a number of council seats in the local elections held on the same day.
