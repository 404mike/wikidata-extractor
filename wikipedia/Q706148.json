As a member of Gentle Giant, he contributed to all 11 albums over the 10 year life of the band. Though he is adept at several instruments, he primarily played keyboards and provided back up and lead vocals. In addition to keyboard, he also played a multitude of other instruments such as the cello, tenor recorder, and classical percussion (including vibraphone, marimba, xylophone, timpani and snare drum). \nHe also composed the original musical soundtrack for the video game Azrael's Tear in 1996, starring Ray Shulman.\nHe now lives in Solihull (West Midlands) with his wife Lesley and has three children, Sally, Sam and Susie. He also composes for cinema and television.\nIn the years following the dissolution of Gentle Giant, Minnear was a member of a Christian music band, The Reapers, in the 1980s. He was also a teacher and church organist. He and his wife Lesley own Alucard Music, which releases Gentle Giant CDs and DVDs. He also plays occasionally with the group Three Friends which reproduces Gentle Giant songs in concerts.  Three Friends is composed of: Mick Wilson singing lead vocals, Gary Green and Andrew Williams on guitar, Roger Carey on bass, Kerry Minnear and John Donaldson on piano and keyboards, and Malcolm Mortimore on drums. Minnear, Green and Mortimore were all been members of Gentle Giant, with Minnear and Green serving continuously and Mortimore solely on the album Three Friends.\nHis son Sam Minnear is a founding member of alternative pop group Misty's Big Adventure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1948 in music", "response": ["*January 2 \u2013 Kerry Minnear, rock keyboardist (Gentle Giant)"]}, {"page": "List of Moog synthesizer players", "response": ["*Kerry Minnear \u2013 Gentle Giant"]}, {"page": "Gentle Giant", "response": ["Gentle Giant was formed in 1970 when the Shulman brothers teamed up with two other multi-instrumentalists, Gary Green (guitar, mandolin, recorder etc.) and Kerry Minnear (keyboards, vibraphone, cello, etc.), plus drummer Martin Smith, who had previously drummed for Simon Dupree and the Big Sound. The classically trained Minnear had recently graduated from the Royal College of Music with a degree in composition, and had played with the band Rust. Green was essentially a blues player and had never worked with a band above the semi-professional level, but adapted readily to the demanding music of the new band. The Shulman brothers, meanwhile, settled into typically multi-instrumental roles of their own - Derek on saxophone and recorder, Ray on bass and violin and Phil on saxophone, trumpet, and clarinet (with all three brothers playing other instruments as and when required).", "The new band also featured three lead vocalists. Derek Shulman sang in a tough rhythm-and-blues style and generally handled the more rock-oriented vocals; Phil Shulman handled the more folk-or-jazz-influenced songs; and Kerry Minnear (who had a particularly delicate voice) sang the lighter folk and chamber-classical lead vocals. Minnear did not sing lead vocals at live concerts, because of his inability to support and project his voice at a level suitable for live amplification (Derek and Phil Shulman handled Minnear's lead vocal parts when the band played live). It has been reported that Elton John unsuccessfully auditioned for lead vocalist with the newly formed group.", "Gentle Giant was followed in 1971 by Acquiring the Taste. This second album showcased a band who were developing rapidly. Far more experimental and dissonant than its predecessor, Acquiring the Taste was shaped primarily by Kerry Minnear's broad classical and contemporary classical music training.  It also showed the band expanding their already impressive instrumental palette (although many years later Derek Shulman would admit \"we recorded [Acquiring the Taste] without any idea of what it would be like before we got into the studio. It was a very experimental album and we still didn't have an ultimate direction\".)\" The band's sense of challenge was made evident in the liner notes to Acquiring the Taste, which contained a particularly lofty statement of intent even by progressive rock standards. Producer Tony Visconti has claimed authorship of this liner note as well as the \"giant\" story accompanying the first album(source: \"Bowie Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy\" [book], Visconti)", "Before embarking on the Octopus tour, the band played a grueling set of dates supporting Black Sabbath, during which they proved to be very unpopular with the majority of the headlining band's fans. Derek Shulman recalled, \"It was perhaps the most ridiculous pairing of groups ever in the history of show business. For the most part we got booed off the stage\". Following the tour, Gentle Giant underwent their most significant line-up change when a burnt-out and discouraged Phil Shulman left the band following disagreements with his brothers. Derek Shulman took over all lead vocals for live concerts, becoming Gentle Giant's de facto lead singer (although Kerry Minnear continued to sing his own share of lead vocals on records).", "Despite this setback, the band pursued their course to its conclusion on 1978's Giant for a Day! on which all former progressive rock stylings were purged in favour of radio-friendly soft rock and further (unsuccessful) attempts at creating hit singles. In order to present a more straightforward group identity, Derek Shulman now handled all lead vocals and the band abandoned their coventional battery of string instruments, wind instruments, tuned percussion and vocal interplay in favour of a straightforward guitar/bass/keyboards/drums/lead singer set-up. Giant for a Day! was another poor seller, later adjudged by the band as being a creative mistake. Derek Shulman eventually remembered it as being \"real contrived\" while Kerry Minnear would confess to having felt unsure as to whether he had anything to contribute to the album (although he did make an attempt to write a commercial single, \"It's Only Goodbye\").", "While Kerry Minnear would pronounce himself far more satisfied with this album and its songs, Ray Shulman would eventually state, \"I hated making [that] last record, I hated being involved with it\". In 2005, Derek Shulman reflected, \"Civilian was done with less passion than some of the other albums. As it turns out we as a band were just not good at being rock or pop stars. We would have loved to be as popular as a Genesis or Rush or Yes. In hindsight, I sometimes think that Gentle Giant was wrongfully put into the progressive rock category. Much of what we did was very clever, but we certainly didn't do these long complex tunes like Yes or Genesis did\".", "In the summer of 1980, the group disbanded. In 2005, Derek Shulman recalled that \"the creative juices just weren't flowing. I was living in Los Angeles at the time when we broke up. We weren't really sure what direction to take. I don't regret the decision we made to disband, and I'd do it again if we were to do the whole thing all over again\". Ray Shulman has commented: \"There was definitely the decision that the last tour would be the last tour. Once we knew that, we enjoyed ourselves. We decided to quit then rather than let it go on too long\".\" In an interview with Mojo in 2000, Kerry Minnear asserted that the split \"wasn't because of punk; it was because we had lost our way musically\".", "John Weathers went on to drum for Man (an association that lasted until 1996) and later played in Glenn Cornick's Wild Turkey. Gary Green (having settled in America, near Chicago) went on to play with various Illinois bands (including Blind Dates, the Elvis Brothers, Big Hello, and Mother Tongue) and guest on recordings and at concerts by Eddie Jobson and Divae. Gary also played guitar on the album Deeper Imaginings by Paul Adams and Australian Elizabeth Geyer that was nominated best New Age album of 2019 by the Independent Music Awards.  Kerry Minnear returned to the UK and settled in Cornwall, spending many years working in gospel music. He now runs Alucard Music, the organization supervising the legal and royalty issues regarding Gentle Giant's music.", "The first was a collaboration between four former Gentle Giant members - Kerry Minnear, John Weathers, Gary Green, and Phil Shulman (who only participated as a lyricist). This group recorded three new songs based on old Kerry Minnear demos for the 2004 Scraping the Barrel box set (\"Home Again\", \"Moog Fugue\", and \"Move Over\"). The band members recorded their parts separately and never reunited in person.", "In March 2009, Green and Mortimore were joined by a third Gentle Giant member in the form of Kerry Minnear and Rentle Giant consequently changed its name to Three Friends. Also at this time, the band vocalist Mick Wilson, as dedicated lead singer. After a short tour, it was announced that Minnear was leaving the band for personal reasons, and that Three Friends planned to continue as a six-piece. In due course, by 2011, Carey, Williams and Donaldson had left the band, to be replaced by Lee Pomeroy on bass and Gary Sanctuary on keyboards. Charlotte Glasson joined in 2012, adding violin, baritone sax, alto sax and recorder, enabling the band to create a live sound closer to the original recordings. This line-up toured Italy, Canada and the United States in 2012. In 2015, the band consisted of Green, Mortimore, Glasson, Neil Angilley and Jonathan Noyce. They have not performed live since then.", "A fan video of \"Proclamation\" was posted on YouTube on 15 July 2020. The video featured appearances from Gentle Giant members Gary Green, Kerry Minnear, Derek Shulman, Ray Shulman, Phil Shulman, John Weathers and Malcolm Mortimore. Additional musicians included Jakko Jakszyk, Billy Sherwood, Yes/Steve Hackett bassist Lee Pomeroy, Rachel Flowers, Dan Reed (Dan Reed Network), Richard Hilton (Chic) and Mikey Heppner (Priestess) among others. The video was directed and edited by Noah Shulman and mixed by his uncle Ray.", "Gentle Giant's music was mostly composed by Kerry Minnear and Ray Shulman, with additional musical ideas contributed by Derek Shulman (who was also known to contribute entire songs).
