He took piano lessons at the age of 7, moving on to guitar at 10. He then had musical training at the Eric Gilder School in London with teacher Ivor Mairants. His professional career ran over 40 years until he retired following a car crash in 2004. During the 1960s he played in a number of bands that left few traces in the history of popular music. The notable exception occurred when he briefly joined John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Dean's guitar is heard on Mayall's first album, John Mayall Plays John Mayall, and first single. Leaving Mayall, he worked with his former band the Nu Notes. In 1971, he played with a band called Spike Island and recorded an album with them, a mixture of folk, country and world music. Later, as a member of various other bands like The Bluejays, P. P. Arnold's backing band and The Bad Boys, he recorded on some hits, but gradually turned to more anonymous work as a session musician playing for TV shows, backing stars and other lucrative jobs, such as cruises on the QE2 as guitarist with the Joe Loss Orchestra. In 1978, Dean became the first Western musician allowed to play electric guitar in China. From 1992 he held teaching posts at various British schools. After a serious illness, Dean died in 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1943 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Roger Dean, English guitarist (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2008", "response": ["*Roger Dean, 65, British guitarist, brain cancer."]}, {"page": "Roger Dean (guitar player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roger Dean (guitarist)"]}, {"page": "List of John Mayall band members", "response": ["Mayall formed the Bluesbreakers in February 1963. Early performers involved with the band included guitarists Sammy Prosser, Davey Graham and John Gilbey, bassists Ricky Brown and Pete Burford, and drummers Sam Stone, Brian Myall and Keith Robertson, however the first official lineup of the group introduced in July included guitarist Bernie Watson, bassist John McVie and drummer Peter Ward. Martin Hart replaced Ward shortly after the band's formation. Shortly before the release of their first single, Watson and Hart were replaced by Roger Dean and Hughie Flint, respectively. A year later, Dean was replaced by Eric Clapton, who debuted with the group on 9 April 1965. By September, the guitarist had abruptly left to form a new band and tour Greece. Several substitutes filled in for Clapton, including Geoff Krivit, ending with Peter Green for around a week. Clapton returned in November. Meanwhile, McVie had been fired in October and replaced by Jack Bruce, although he only remained for around a month.", "|Roger Dean", "*Roger Dean \u2013 guitar"]}]}}
