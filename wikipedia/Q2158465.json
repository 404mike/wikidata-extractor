School of Oriental and African Studies \u2013 2002 \"... around 331, Eusebius says of the place name Nazareth that ' from this name the Christ was called a Nazoraean, and in ancient times we, who are now called Christians, were once called Nazarenes ';6 thus he attributes this designation ...\" Tertullian (Against Marcion 4:8) records that \"for this reason the Jews call us 'Nazarenes'.\" In the New Testament Christians are called \"Christians\" three times by Paul in Romans, and \"Nazarenes\" once by Tertullus, a Jewish lawyer. The Rabbinic and modern Hebrew name for Christians, notzrim, is also thought to derive from Nazareth, and be connected with Tertullus' charge against Paul of being a member of the sect of the Nazarenes, Nazoraioi, \"men of Nazareth\" in Acts. Against this, some medieval Jewish polemical texts connect notzrim with the netsarim \"watchmen\" of Ephraim in Jeremiah 31:6. In Syriac Aramaic Nasrath (\u0722\u0728\u072a\u072c) is used for Nazareth, while \"Nazarenes\" (Acts 24:5) and \"of Nazareth\" are both Nasrani or Nasraya (\u0715\u0722\u0728\u072a\u071d\u0710) an adjectival form.Bruce Manning Metzger The early versions of the New Testament p86 \u2013 1977 \"Peshitta Matt, and Luke ... nasraya, 'of Nazareth'.\"William Jennings Lexicon to the Syriac New Testament 1926 p143Robert Payne Smith Compendious Syriac Dictionary 1903 p349 Nasrani is used in the Quran for Christians, and in Modern Standard Arabic may refer more widely to Western people.

It forms a contemporary record of great value to the historian. Its somewhat disordered state, the want of chronological arrangement, and the occasional repetition of accounts of the same events are due, as the author himself informs us (ii. 50), to the work being almost entirely composed during the times of his imprisonment in Constantinople. The same cause may account for the somewhat slovenly Syriac style. The writer claims to have treated his subject impartially, and though written from the narrow point of view of one to whom Miaphysite Orthodoxy was all-important, it is largely a faithful reproduction of events as they occurred. This third part was edited by William Cureton (Oxford, 1853) and E.W. Brooks (CSCO 105, Louvain, 1935), and was translated - sometimes paraphrase - into English by Robert Payne Smith (Oxford, 1860), into German by J. M.
