On regaining his place, King formed a useful partnership with fellow half-backs Bill Kennedy and Billy Kingdon, but again The Saints struggled to avoid relegation finishing 19th in the table. For the following season he again lost his place, this time to Welsh international Alf Day who had arrived on a free transfer from Millwall. Once King got back into the side in December he played in the remainder of the season's matches. He started the following season but after the match against West Bromwich Albion on 1 October 1938, he was replaced by the former Arsenal player Ray Parkin who had dropped back from his previous role as an inside forward."]}]}}
