The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse's voice for Darth Vader. It also lacked most special effects; hand-drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams, and when the Millennium Falcon fought TIE fighters, the film cut to footage of World War II dogfights. The reactions of the directors present, such as Brian De Palma, John Milius, and Steven Spielberg, disappointed Lucas. Spielberg, who said he was the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film, believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film; Gareth Wigan told Lucas: \"This is the greatest film I've ever seen\" and cried during the screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before. The delays increased the budget from $8\u00a0million to $11\u00a0million."]}, {"page": "The Fabulous Baker Boys", "response": ["A first draft of the screenplay was completed as early as April 1985, in which Kloves describes the titular characters as \"a poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.\" The Fabulous Baker Boys was Kloves's directorial debut. Kloves's experience writing his previous film, Racing with the Moon (1984), motivated him to direct The Fabulous Baker Boys himself because the final version of the former \"wasn't what I saw in my head\". Although Kloves had always aspired to direct the film himself, he considered his prospects unlikely due to his young age (he was 25 years-old when he first started optioning the script to filmmakers) and lack of filmmaking experience, having only written one film prior. Fearing a different director would struggle to fulfill his vision, his determination ultimately delayed the project by several years. Kloves decided to keep the script to himself until he could secure funding that would also allow him to direct his own project. Kloves finally sold The Fabulous Baker Boys as a spec script to then-Warner Bros. worldwide production president Mark Rosenberg, after originally selling it to producers Paula Weinstein and Gareth Wigan of WW Productions. Weinstein and Wigan eventually negotiated a deal to share the film rights with Rosenberg."]}, {"page": "Reach for the Sky", "response": ["* Gareth Wigan as Woodhall's Assistant"]}, {"page": "Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy", "response": ["*Gareth Wigan (former production executive for 20th Century Fox)"]}, {"page": "Ghost in the Noonday Sun", "response": ["The script was written by Evan Jones and Ernest Tidyman (uncredited) with additional dialogue by Spike Milligan.

Pertwee was approached to play the lead character by producer Gareth Wigan.
