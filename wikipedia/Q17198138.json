Discussions and a decision between Dame Margaret Weston of the Science Museum, London, and Bradford's city councillors led to the establishment of the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, as it was then called, which was opened on 16 June 1983. The museum launched Britain's largest cinema screen on the same day: the IMAX screen was five storeys high with six-channel sound. During this period the museum specialised in the art and science of images and image-making. Colin Ford, its first director, believed that understanding how images are made led to better appreciation of the ideas expressed, the intentions and skills of the image-makers.", "* Colin Ford, first Head of Museum, 1983\u20131993."]}, {"page": "Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales", "response": ["* Colin Ford (1993\u20131998)"]}, {"page": "Royal Photographic Society", "response": ["*1989   \u2013    Colin Ford", "===Colin Ford Award===", "The RPS established the annual Colin Ford Award in 2003 for contributions to curatorship.
