The first South Asian musician to gain wide popularity in the UK and worldwide fame was Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara in Zanzibar, East Africa, to parents of Parsi descent from Bombay (now Mumbai). In 2006, Time Asia magazine voted him as one of the most influential South Asians in the past 60 years. At around the same time, music producer, composer and songwriter Biddu gained worldwide fame for a number of hit songs, including \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas and \"I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)\" for Tina Charles. In the 1990s the South Asian artists who gained mainstream success included Apache Indian, whose 1993 single \"Boom Shack-A-Lak\" was used in many Hollywood movies, and Jas Mann, who headed Babylon Zoo and whose 1996 single \"Spaceman\" set a UK chart record when it sold 418,000 copies in its first week of release. The most successful South Asian musician in 2008 was the British Tamil artist M.I.A., who was nominated for two Grammy Awards for her single \"Paper Planes\", and has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for \"O...

The Guardian named the album their \"CD of the week\". Rick Glanvill said: \"This is a fey, pretentious vision of music but deny its energy and style to your detriment... Lyrics aren't a strong point but strong tunes put [Mann] on the harder side of glam.\" Qs Martin Aston asserted that \"Spaceman\" is \"startlingly great\", with the rest of the record being \"equally appealing\".
