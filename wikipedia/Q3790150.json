McNaughton commanding the First Canadian Army had the task of breaking out over the river Thames to \"take\" Huntingdon, which was the \"capital\" of the fictional country of \"Eastland\", which was defended by VIII Corps and XI Corps of the British Army. Much of the criticism of McNaughton's leadership was over his decision on the night of 7 March 1943 to leave his command post to personally supervise the building of a bridge over the Thames, instead of sending out an engineer officer to build the bridge. This showed that McNaughton was unable to delegate authority properly as he insisted on doing everything himself, leading to command paralysis. McNaughton did not understand war on the operational level, and Colonel English wrote: \"That McNaughton had no idea that a corps required a minimum of 24 hour warning in order to execute a major task is borne out by the following timings: at 23:35 on 6 March, he directed 2 Corps to advance east across the Thames through 1 Corps; at 16:15, the next day he gave counter orders to effect the western envelopment that night; at 21:30 on 10 March he issued orders for operations the following day; and at 22:59 11 March, he gave orders for operations on 12 March\". Sir James Grigg, the British War Secretary, who attended the Spartan war game wrote he was \"appalled at McNaughton's indecision\" as \"he stood in front of his situation map hesitating as to what to do and what orders to issue\". General Alan Brooke, who also attended the Spartan war game wrote in his diary that the Spartan war game had done much to \"proving my worse fear that\u00a0... McNaughton is quite incompetent to command an army!\". The man who was to replace McNaughton as commander of First Canadian Army, General Harry Crerar later wrote that during the Spartan war game \"that it became patently obvious to all\" that McNaughton \"was totally unsuitable for high operational command\".

In one experiment, he divided a unit into four groups\u2014officers, junior NCOs, senior NCOs and polled an entire unit, asking all ranks to nominate potential officers. Those nominated by three out of four groups were then sent to the Wozbee. Of the 114 nominated, 56 per cent passed, which was not significantly higher than the usual 54 per cent, but 7 per cent of the unit was nominated instead of the usual 0.1 per cent, producing far more officers. Adam then wanted to expand the trial, but for his critics, it was clear evidence that he had finally crossed the line from socialism to full-blown Bolshevism. The Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces, Lieutenant General Sir Bernard Paget wrote to the Secretary of State for War, Sir James Grigg, warning him that Adam was \"a serious menace to both morale and discipline.\" When the matter was placed before the Army Council, Brooke and Grigg, who normally protected Adam, failed to support it, and the trial did not proceed. The British Army remained short of officers. In order to supplement the British Army with junior officers, Adam helped devise the CANLOAN program in 1944; which saw 673 Canadian officers serve in British units. Just before D-Day, some 200 Canadian officers were seconded to the British 21st Army Group in Europe, and 168 Australian officers to the Fourteenth Army in Burma. The effectiveness of the Wozbees is hard to gauge.  When commanding officers in the Mediterranean and the 21st Army Group  were surveyed in 1943 and 1944, they considered that there was little difference between the products of the Wozbees and those nominated by earlier means, suggesting that their training was more important. George MacDonald Fraser, the author of the Harry Flashman series of novels opined that \"the general view throughout the Army was that they weren't fit to select bus conductors, let alone officers.\""]}, {"page": "1942 Cardiff East by-election", "response": ["The by-election took place during the Second World War.
