However, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms. This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the end of Western European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms. Womanism emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class. Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless. Third-world feminism and indigenous feminism are closely related to postcolonial feminism. These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism, Stiwanism, negofeminism, femalism, transnational feminism, and Africana womanism."]}, {"page": "Phenomenology (philosophy)", "response": ["* Sara Ahmed, \"Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others\" (Durham: Duke University Press 2006)"]}, {"page": "Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["The Media and Communications Department, as well as the Centre for Cultural Studies, include Matthew Fuller, David Morley, Scott Lash, Angela McRobbie, Nirmal Puwar and (formerly) Sara Ahmed."]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1940\u20131999||data-sort-value=\"Ahmed, Sara\"|Sara Ahmed||United Kingdom||1969||\u2013||British-Australian academic working at the intersection of feminist theory, queer theory, critical race theory and postcolonialism||"]}, {"page": "Anthropocene", "response": ["Other critiques of \"Anthropocene\" have focused on the genealogy of the concept. Todd also provides a phenomenological account, which draws on the work of the philosopher Sara Ahmed, writing: \"When discourses and responses to the Anthropocene are being generated within institutions and disciplines which are embedded in broader systems that act as de facto 'white public space,' the academy and its power dynamics must be challenged.\" Other aspects which constitute current understandings of the concept of the \"Anthropocene\" such as the ontological split between nature and society, the assumption of the centrality and individuality of the human, and the framing of environmental discourse in largely scientific terms have been criticized by scholars as concepts rooted in colonialism and which reinforce systems of postcolonial domination. To that end, Todd makes the case that the concept of \"Anthropocene\" must be indigenized and decolonized if it is to become a vehicle of justice as opposed to white thought and domination."]}, {"page": "Lesbian feminism", "response": ["Some key thinkers and activists include Charlotte Bunch, Rita Mae Brown, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Marilyn Frye, Mary Daly, Sheila Jeffreys, Barbara Smith, Pat Parker, Margaret Sloan-Hunter, Cheryl Clarke, Gloria Anzaldua, Cherrie Moraga, Monique Wittig, and Sara Ahmed (although the last two are more commonly associated with the emergence of queer theory).", "In Living a Feminist Life (2017), Sara Ahmed imagines lesbian feminism as a fundamental and necessary alliance with trans feminism.

Scholars of Feminist Disability Studies include Rosemarie Garland-Thomson and Alison Kafer. Rosemarie Garland-Thomson explains that these related systems of oppression pervades all aspects of culture by \"its structuring institutions, social identities, cultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and the shared human experience of embodiment\". Garland-Thomson further describes that \"identity based critical enterprises have enriched and complicated our understandings of social justice, subject formation, subjugated knowledges and collective action\". Feminism works towards accessibility for everyone regardless of which societal oppressive behavior makes them a minority. Although physical adjustments are most commonly fought for in disability awareness, psychological exclusion also plays a major role oppressing people with disabilities. The intersection of disability and feminism is more common in American history than we think yet it does not show up in media, museums or archives that are dedicated to feminist work. Rachel Corbman, a professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Stony Brook University In New York highlights how the influence of lesbian feminist organizations like the \"Disabled Lesbian Alliance (DLA)\"  are not represented in the archives of literature and documentation of events in the community. The DLA work close together to fight for visibility, accessibility and acceptance of individuals whether they are disabled, or lesbian or both. Corbman's article highlights the beginning of disability activism during the feminist movement of the 1970s and 80s and how the intersecting identities enticed new members and activists from across the country to join the cause. Other disability centered feminist organizations that are part of the feminist archives include the Lesbian Illness Support Group and Gay and Lesbian Blind (GLB).  Sara Ahmed elaborates the mental exclusiveness of privilege in \"Atmospheric Walls\", that there is an atmosphere that surrounds minority bodies which explains why an intersectionally privileged person could be made uncomfortable simply by being in the same room as a person of color, or in this case someone with a disability. Feminists and scholars also developed theories that put attention on the connection of gender and disability. Scholars like Thomas J. Gerschick argued that disability plays a big role on processing and experiencing gender, and people with disabilities often suffer stigmatization towards their gender, since their disabilities may make their body representation excluded by normative binary gender representation. Gerschick also argues that this stigmatization can affect the gendering process and self-representation of people with disabilities. Ellen Samuels explores gender, queer sexualities, and disability. Feminists also look into how people with disabilities are politically oppressed and powerless. Abby L. Wilkerson argues that people with disabilities are politically powerless because they are often desexualized, and the lack of sexual agency leads to the lack of political agency. Wilkerson also indicates that the erotophobia towards minority groups like people with disabilities further oppresses them, since it prevents these groups from gaining political power through sexual agency and power."]}, {"page": "Affect theory", "response": ["Affect theory is explored in philosophy, psychoanalytic theory, gender studies, and art theory.

The idea that performance is ephemeral is essential to the field of performance studies. In this essay, Mu\u00f1oz claims that ephemera does not disappear. Ephemera in the Mu\u00f1ozian sense, is a modality of \"anti-rigor\" and \"anti-evidence\" that reformulates understandings of materiality. Building on Raymond Williams' concept of \"structures of feeling\", Mu\u00f1oz claims that the ephemeral, \"traces, glimmers, residues, and specks of things,\" is distinctly material, though not always solid. Framing the performative as both an intellectual and discursive event, he begins by defining queerness as a possibility, a modality, of the social and the relational, a sense of self-knowing. He argues that queerness is passed on surreptitiously due to the fact that the trace of queerness often leaves the queer subject vulnerable for attack. Mu\u00f1oz's definition of ephemera is influenced by Paul Gilroy's The Black Atlantic \"as part of the exchange of ephemera that connects and makes concert a community.\" As a result, Mu\u00f1oz states, queerness has not been able to exist as \"visible evidence\" rather it has had to exist in fleeting moments. Thus, queer performances stand as evidence of queer possibilities and queer worldmaking. Mu\u00f1oz understands Marlon Riggs' documentary films Tongues Untied and Black Is, Black Ain't as examples of an ephemeral witnessing of Black queer identity. In 2013,  Mu\u00f1oz was a collaborator on the exhibit, An Unhappy Archive at Les Complices in Zurich. The goal of the exhibit was to question the normative definition of happiness through the use of texts, posters, books, and drawings. The title of the project is a reference to Sara Ahmed's concept of the \"unhappy archive.\" According to Ahmed, the unhappy archive is a collective project rooted in feminist-queer and anti-racist politics. Other collaborators include Ann Cvetkovich, Karin Michalski, Sabian Baumann, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. Mu\u00f1oz departs from Peggy Phelan's argument that the ontology of performance lies in its disappearance. Mu\u00f1oz parts from this view as it is confined to a narrow view of time.
