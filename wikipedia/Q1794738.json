Disappointed by his debut's poor sales, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\" Boyd later said. \"I imagined it as more commercial.\"Dann (2006), p. 142. Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \"Northern Sky\" and \"Fly\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \"Northern Sky\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential.Dann (2006), p. 242.

Boyd was in England at the time and agreed to attend the recordings. The initial session was followed by recordings in July 1974. In his 2006 autobiography, Boyd recalled being taken aback at Drake's anger and bitterness: \"[He said that] I had told him he was a genius, and others had concurred. Why wasn't he famous and rich? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years.\"Boyd (2006), pp. 259, 261. Boyd and Wood noticed a deterioration in Drake's performance, requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar. However, the return to Sound Techniques' studio raised Drake's spirits; his mother recalled, \"We were so absolutely thrilled to think that Nick was happy because there hadn't been any happiness in Nick's life for years.\""]}, {"page": "John Wood", "response": ["John Wood may refer to:", "* John Wood, the Elder (1704\u20131754), English architect", "* John Wood, the Younger (1728\u20131782) architect", "* John Wood (professor) (c.1775\u20131822), American professor of mathematics", "* John Wood (design theorist) (born 1945), British professor of design ", "* John Wood (activist) (born 1964), education activist, marketing director at Microsoft", "* Sir John Wood (professor of law) (1932 -
