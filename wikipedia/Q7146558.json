Rommel's position was now critical. The army in North Africa was starved of supplies while the British reinforced their lines in Egypt, prior to the Second Battle of El Alamein. He complained to the OKW that he was severely short of ammunition and fuel for offensive action. The Axis organised a convoy to relieve the difficulties. Ultra intercepted the Axis communications, and Wellingtons of 69 Squadron confirmed the Axis operation was real. Gibbs's Beauforts sank two ships and one of Simpson's submarines sank a third. Rommel still hoped another tanker, San Andreas, would deliver the 3,198 tons of fuel needed for the Battle of Alam el Halfa. Rommel did not wait for it to dock, and launched the offensive before its arrival. The ship was sunk by an attack led by Gibbs. Of the nine ships sent, five were sunk by Malta's forces. The Beauforts were having a devastating impact on Axis fuel supplies which were now nearly used up. On 1 September, Rommel was forced to retreat. Kesselring handed over Luftwaffe fuel, but this merely denied the German air units the means to protect the ground forces, thereby increasing the effectiveness of British air superiority over the frontline."]}, {"page": "1915 in Wales", "response": ["*2 April - Patrick Gibbs, RAF Wing Commander, author and film critic (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "2008 in Wales", "response": ["*8 March \u2013 Patrick Gibbs, RAF Wing Commander, author and film critic, 92"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Penarth", "response": ["* Patrick Gibbs (1916 \u2013 April 2008) was born in Penarth and died aged 92 best remembered as chief film critic of The Daily Telegraph from 1960 to 1986.
