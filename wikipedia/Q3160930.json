However, modern testing showed that the surviving samples from his experiments were natural diamond, not synthetic. While his techniques were conducive to diamond formation, modern diamond production \u2013 not achieved until the 1950s \u2013 requires capabilities not available in Hannay's time. Hannay was also known for making precision instruments.", "link_mentions": {}}}
