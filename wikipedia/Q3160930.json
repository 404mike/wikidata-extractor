The earliest successes were reported by James Ballantyne Hannay in 1879 and by Ferdinand Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Henri Moissan in 1893. Their method involved heating charcoal at up to 3500\u00a0\u00b0C with iron inside a carbon crucible in a furnace. Whereas Hannay used a flame-heated tube, Moissan applied his newly developed electric arc furnace, in which an electric arc was struck between carbon rods inside blocks of lime. The molten iron was then rapidly cooled by immersion in water. The contraction generated by the cooling supposedly produced the high pressure required to transform graphite into diamond. Moissan published his work in a series of articles in the 1890s."]}, {"page": "Solvated electron", "response": ["The observation of the color of metal-electride solutions is generally attributed to Humphry Davy.

Moissan heated charcoal (a form of carbon) and iron in a furnace until the iron melted, then rapidly cooled it, claiming that the iron would generate high pressure and transform some of the charcoal into (very small) diamonds. Others tried to repeat this experiment in later years, with only a few reporting that they could reproduce the result; commercially successful production of synthetic diamonds was not achieved until the 1950s.Artificial Diamonds, Human Touch of Chemistry, accessed 16 March 2014.History of Man Made Diamonds Man Made Diamond Information, accessed 16 March 2014."]}]}}
