He was involved in most of Southampton's attacks and when John Bainbridge swung over a deep cross from the right it appeared to have been over hit and going out of play. Suddenly, \"out of nowhere\", Costello arrived and met the ball with his head, sending it back over the goalkeeper into the far corner of the net.
