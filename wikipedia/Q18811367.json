In 1890\u20131891 he worked as an assistant in a medical practice, but then returned to the University of Aberdeen in 1891 and worked under David James Hamilton on the pathology of the mammalian nervous system. Bulloch did post-graduate work at the University of Leipzig as a voluntary assistant to Birch-Hirschfeld and also studied at Vienna. In 1894 he returned briefly to the University of Aberdeen and received the higher medical qualification Doctor of Medicine. In 1894 he became an assistant to David Ferrier at King's College London and then an assistant to Victor Horsley at University College Hospital. Bulloch studied in Paris and Copenhagen and returned to the UK in 1895 to become the chief bacteriologist at the British Institute for Preventive Medicine's antitoxin laboratory at Sudbury. In 1897 he was appointed to a lectureship in bacteriology at the London Hospital. In 1917 his position as lecturer was given the name Goldsmith's Professor of Bacteriology in the University of London. Bulloch lectured in bacteriology at the University of London from 1897 until this official retirement in 1934 but he continued to do some laboratory work after his retirement.\nHe chaired the governing body of the Lister Institute and was an original member of the Medical Research Council.

Brown's Will stated the purpose of his bequest for \"founding, establishing and upholding an Institution for investigating, studying and, without charge beyond immediate expenses, endeavouring to cure maladies, distempers and injuries any quadrupeds or birds useful to man may be subject to, for and towards which purpose of founding, establishing and upholding such animal sanatory institution within a mile of either Westminster, Southwark or Dublin.\u201d The funds were transferred to the University of London in 1858 and accumulated interest till 1871 to a value of \u00a333,781. John Burdon-Sanderson was appointed as superintendent and because the Mortmain Act prevent purchase of land using the trust fund, a site of 1.5 acres was purchased with a \u00a32000 gift from John Cunliffe of Lombard Street and \u00a3500 from Burdon-Sanderson. The land was on Wandsworth Road. The institute was opened in 1871. The single large building had one basement floor accessible by a trapdoor from the apparatus room. A description by William Bulloch in 1925 notes: \"If one takes a tram from Westminster Bridge along the Embankment past \u201cLambeth Palace and Doultons and underneath an ugly railway bridge across the Wandsworth Road one reaches (No. 149) a small archway on which is graven the legend \u201cThe Brown Sanatory Institution founded 1871.\u201d On entering, one comes to a stable yard and, behind, a low building of one storey. This is the famous \u201cBrown\u201d now falling, sad to say, into a considerable state of decay and uncared for.\"The institute was supported by John Simon (1816-1904) pathologist and medical officer in the board of health for London. Among the researchers who worked at the institute was a Viennese scientist, Emanuel Edward Klein, sometimes considered the father of British bacteriology. The research he and his colleagues conducted at the Institution were published as in 1873 as the Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory along with John Burdon-Sanderson, Michael Foster, and Thomas Lauder Brunton. Their experiments included vivisection of animals, and following widespread protests, led to an enquiry in 1875, the Royal Commission on Vivisection for Scientific Purposes, chaired by Lord Cardwell and which resulted in the establishment of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876. Activists writing in the press pointed out that a founding principle, \"kindness to animals is a general principle of the Institution\" was hardly followed."]}, {"page": "William Ewart Gye", "response": ["After a difficult financial struggle, Bullock matriculated at University College, Nottingham and, after studying chemistry under Kipping, graduated there with a BSc in 1906. In 1911 Bullock married his first wife, Elsa Gye, who was a dedicated suffragette. Bullock studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and in 1912 graduated there MBChB. In 1913 he received his Doctor of Medicine qualification from the University, and won a gold medal for his medical thesis. He also won the Ellis Prize in Physiology for his essay, \u201cThe chemistry of nerve degeneration.\u201d Still in 1913 he joined the staff of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, which at that time was under the direction of Ernest Francis Bashford. When World War I started, Bullock joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in France and then Italy in charge of a field ambulance unit. He was reassigned to London as a hospital pathologistl and worked with William Cramer on gas gangrene. After demobilization with the rank of captain, he joined the National Institute for Medical Research at Hampstead, where he worked with Edgar Hartley Kettle on silicosis. In June 1919, William Bullock's wife retook her maiden name, and William Ewart Bullock changed his surname to \"Gye\", perhaps because he wanted to please his wife and perhaps because he was irritated by having to often explain that he was not the bacteriologist William Bulloch \u2014 there is a theory that the name change was in gratitude to a benefactor (not Bullock's wife or father-in-law). This story by Peter Vischer alleges that Bullock changed his surname to \"Gye\" before 1919, but this allegation is false."]}]}}
