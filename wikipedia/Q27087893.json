Edward Hartopp Craddock,  D.D. (29 November 1810 \u2013 27 January 1886) was an Oxford college head in the 19th century.Craddock was born in Shenstone, Staffordshire and educated at Balliol College, Oxford, matriculating 1827, and graduating B.A. in 1831. At Brasenose College he graduated M.A. in 1834 as Edward Grove, his birth name, and B.D. & D.D. in 1854. He held the living at Tedstone Delamere; and was Principal of Brasenose from 1853 until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Brasenose College, Oxford", "response": ["The post-1785 period would see an era of prosperity of the college under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and academic success considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until the second half of the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports\u00a0\u2013 where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated\u00a0\u2013 although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as principal in 1889 led to a reversal in Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, opening up the library to undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time and accepting Rhodes scholarships.", "Edward Hartopp Cradock (known as \"Chief\") became principal in 1853, and would lead the college until 1886; most notable in his tenure was the introduction of organised sports and the resulting public image of Brasenose as a sporting college.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0248\u2013249. This included the membership of oarsman Walter Bradford Woodgate, founder of Vincent's Club, and sometime president of the club Tom Edwards-Moss.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0256. It produced many blues rowers, seven in 1860\u20131867 alone. Between 1870 and 1872, the Oxford varsity cricket team was similarly dominated by Brasenose men, including Conrad Wallroth.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0270. One, Arthur Heath, went on to become a Conservative Party politician, although legal and careers in the church still dominated.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0271. Brasenose was also very well turned out in rugby and football\u00a0\u2013 including Cuthbert Ottaway and Heath\u00a0\u2013 but cricket and rowing defined its success.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0299."]}, {"page": "List of Principals of Brasenose College, Oxford", "response": ["| Edward Hartopp Cradock"]}]}}
