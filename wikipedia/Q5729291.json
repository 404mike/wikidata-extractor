Dunn's memoirs are a valuable source for the lives of the Pre-Raphaelites. He was paid to be Rossetti's factotum and to create copies of Rossetti's paintings. It has been said that the painting Lady Lilith in the Metropolitan Museum of Art was actually painted by Dunn and only \"touched up\" by Rossetti.Dunn left Rossetti's house because he was owed his salary. After Rossetti died, Dunn received the money that was owing to him and he would die whilst living with the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Theodore Watts-Dunton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1882 in art", "response": ["* Henry Treffry Dunn \u2013 Rossetti and Watts-Dunton at 16 Cheyne Walk"]}, {"page": "Theodore Watts-Dunton", "response": ["Watts Dunton later decided also to take in Henry Treffry Dunn, who had been one of Rossetti's assistants.
