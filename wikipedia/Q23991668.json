He was part of the Wales national football team between 1920 and 1921, playing 6 matches. He played his first match on 14 February 1920 against Ireland and his last match on 9 April 1921 also against Ireland. At club level, he played for several clubs with Rotherham County being his most successful. He made 49 war-time guest appearances for Leeds City, scoring 6 goals in total. On 17 October 1919, an auction was held at the Metropole Hotel in Leeds, where the playing staff of Leeds was auctioned off along with other assets of the club. The 16 members of the playing squad were bought by 9 different clubs for a total of \u00a39,250. Millership was bought by Rotherham County for \u00a31,000, it was the second highest bid for a player. Billy McLeod was bought for \u00a31,250 by Notts County.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leeds City F.C.", "response": ["| Harry Millership|| Rotherham County|| \u00a31,000"]}, {"page": "1919\u201320 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Harry Millership"]}, {"page": "Millership", "response": ["*Harry Millership (1889\u20131959), British footballer"]}, {"page": "History of the Wales national football team (1876\u20131976)", "response": ["Wales' first fixtures at the end of the war were two friendly matches against England, organised to raise funds for the FAW. The matches were not considered full internationals, being titled victory matches instead. Wales won the first meeting, led by the 40-year-old Meredith, but were defeated in the return match a fortnight later. The British Home Championship returned for the 1919\u201320 season with Wales' first official post-war match ending in a 2\u20132 draw with pre-war champions Ireland in Belfast. A draw against Scotland was followed by a 2\u20131 victory over England, the first time Wales had defeated their neighbours in a competitive fixture since 1882. Goals from Stan Davies and Dick Richards secured victory for Wales, who had been reduced to ten men in the second half when Harry Millership went off injured, but the performance of the now 45-year-old Meredith drew headlines. Winning his final cap, 25 years after his debut, Meredith wept openly at the end of the match. He ended his international career as both Wales' most-capped player and record goalscorer having scored 11 times in 48 appearances. To secure the championship, the team still needed England to defeat Scotland. The Scots led 4\u20132 at half-time, but lost the match 5\u20134, handing the title to Wales."]}]}}
