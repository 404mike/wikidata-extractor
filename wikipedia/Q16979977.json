Although they never replicated their earlier success, signed to CBS (Columbia in the US) the group did manage to score a few hits with It's So Nice (To Have You Home) (1976), I Wanna Go Back (1977) and Anthem (One Day in Every Week) (1978). This line up remained intact until 1978, when Danny Finn and Eve Graham left the group to marry. Their final single for CBS was Don't Stop The Music in 1979, with Kathy Ann Rae on lead vocal, but after it failed to chart, she left the band and the group signed their final contract with EMI. In 1980, the group attempted to represent the UK again in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song Tell Me, but it was disqualified shortly before the British heats were televised due to the fact the group had already performed the song on TV a year earlier. Had they appeared in the 1980 UK contest, the group would have been up against former member Danny Finn, who was the lead singer of the winning group Prima Donna. In addition, Mick Flinn and Donna Jones of the final New Seekers line-up (2010) were also in the contest, placing fourth under the group name Pussyfoot. Marty Kristian entered a song in the 1983 UK Eurovision finals, performed by a trio called 'Audio', which included Kathy Ann Rae in the line up. Since then, there have been personnel changes which included Caitriona Walsh, Nicola Kerr and Vikki James (Grammy Winner Victoria Horn). Paul Layton remained with the band throughout this time. The final tour was 2010.", "Today's New Seekers toured from 2006 with the latest line up of Paul Layton, Donna Jones, Francine Rees, Mick Flinn and Mark Hankins. A CD of the 2006 tour was released which includes all of the group's hits along with some cover versions. With a Royal Variety performance at St James's Palace, London for the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall and an appearance on ITV's This Morning, they completed 2006. The New Seekers helped host a garden party in 2007 at Buckingham Palace. This was repeated the following year along with a special show at The Tower of London and a return batch of concerts in British theatres. The 40th anniversary of the group in 2009 was celebrated by a 35-date UK concert tour, which began at London's Shaw Theatre on 31 January and continued throughout the year. In July 2009, an album was released; It's Been Too Long \u2013 Greatest Hits and More, comprising the group's hits and some new recordings.
