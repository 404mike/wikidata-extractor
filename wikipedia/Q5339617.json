He was described as a prominent evangelical.Born in Bangalore, the second son of the Reverend George Knox and Frances Mary Anne (daughter of Thomas Forbes Reynolds, M.D. and a sister of the daughter-in-law of John Arbuthnott, 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott) and educated at St Paul's and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he was ordained in 1872 and began his ecclesiastical career with a period as Fellow, Tutor, and Dean of Merton College, Oxford.  He was also rector of St Wilfrid's Church in Kibworth from 1884 to 1891, then from 1891 vicar of Aston by Birmingham, and from 1894 to 1903 rector of St Philip's, Birmingham, Suffragan Bishop of Coventry and Archdeacon of Birmingham.Knox was the author of a distinguished history of the Oxford Movement written from an unsympathetic evangelical viewpoint.\nKnox was an early proponent of cremation. In a letter read at the 1903 opening ceremony of the Birmingham Crematorium, he wrote:\nin spite of strong sentimental objections very naturally entertained, we shall come to see that under the conditions of modern life cremation is not only preferable from the sanitary point of view, but that it is also the most reverent and decent treatment of the bodies of the dead.\nDuring the First World War, Knox was an early proponent of conscription rather than relying on volunteers to serve in the forces and elsewhere. He believed that the Government should have legislated for \u2018The whole resources of the country in men and means\u2019 being placed \u2018unreservedly at the disposal of the country\u2019.  He was one of the few bishops who supported the desire of many younger clergy to serve as combatants which the Bench of Bishops had voted overwhelmingly against.  \u2018My heart is with those clergy who wish to show that they are ready to share the same hardships and dangers as the rest of their parishioners\u2019.Knox died on 16 January 1937. On 27 January 1937, a memorial service was held at All Souls Church, Langham Place. H. Earnshaw Smith, then Rector of All Souls, officiated the service, Sidney Nowell Rostron read the lesson and T. W. Gilbert gave the address. He was then laid to rest in what is now Beckenham Cemetery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
