He began acting at the age of 12. In 1841 he married Sarah Mitchell, also an actor, and they had at least seven children all of whom were trained for the stage. In 1842 he took out a lease on the Theatre Royal in Richmond, specialising in Shakespearian productions.In 1852 his father died, and Townsend gave up acting to take over the family business.  In 1857 he was approached by the Liberals to run in the general election of that year in opposition to one of the sitting members of parliament for Greenwich, Montague Chambers. Chambers had been elected as a Liberal in 1852, but had since left the party to run as an independent. Townsend was only approached two days before nominations for the election were made, but was very well known in the area, and easily defeated Chambers. Soon after the election it was alleged that Townsend was ineligible for election as he did not have an annual income of \u00a3300. In March 1858 he was adjudged bankrupt. He was suspended from the House of Commons, and came to an arrangement to pay off his debts within 12 months.He returned to the stage in an attempt to pay off his creditors, playing leading roles in a number of London theatres where was billed as \"John Townsend, MP\". After a prolonged attempt to retain his seat, he resigned by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead in February 1859.Townsend became the manager of the Theatre Royal, Leicester, and by 1862 had discharged his debts. He emigrated to Canada in May 1862, purchasing a farm outside Kingston, Ontario. He returned to acting in 1864, and in 1868 the family moved to Hamilton. They formed the \"Townsend Family Star Dramatic Troupe\" and toured Canada and the United States.In 1877 Townsend became seriously ill in Indiana and had to leave the travelling company. He became a teacher of acting and elocution in Hamilton, where Julia Arthur was his most famous student. Townsend died in 1892 of liver cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Townsend"]}, {"page": "John Townsend", "response": ["John Townsend may refer to:", "*John Townsend (author) (born 1956), American psychologist and author", "*John Townsend (basketball) (1916\u20132001), American basketball player", "*John Townsend (British politician) (1819\u20131892), British politician and member of Parliament for Greenwich", "*John Townsend (educator) (1757\u20131826), English Congregationalist minister and founder of school for deaf children", "*John Townsend (footballer) (born 1943), Australian rules footballer", "*John Townsend (Irish politician) (1737\u20131810), Irish MP for Dingle, Doneraile and Castlemartyr", "*John Townsend (Mayor) (1783\u20131854), 37th mayor of Albany, NY", "*John Townsend (MP for Warwick), English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1597 to 1614", "*John Townsend (New York City) (1789\u20131863), New York politician", "*John Townsend (Norwich) (1608\u20131668), early settler of the American colonies", "*John Townsend (Wisconsin politician) (born 1938), Wisconsin politician", "*John Townsend (1732\u20131809), Cabinet maker of the Goddard and Townsend style", "*John Townsend (musician)"]}, {"page": "Townsend (name)", "response": ["* John Townsend Trowbridge, American author", "* John Townsend (author) (born 1956), American psychologist and author", "* John Townsend (basketball) (died 2001), American basketball player", "* John Townsend (footballer) (born 1943), Australian rules footballer", "* John Townsend (Mayor) (1783\u20131854), 37th mayor of Albany, NY", "* John Townsend (Norwich) (1608\u20131668), early American settler in Oyster Bay, Long Island", "* John Townsend (Wisconsin politician), American politician", "* John Townsend (British politician) (1819\u20131892), British politician and Member of Parliament for Greenwich", "* John Townsend (Irish politician) (1737\u20131810), Irish MP for Dingle, Doneraile and Castlemartyr"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1857 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Townsend||Liberal"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1857\u20131868)", "response": ["|John Townsend"]}]}}
