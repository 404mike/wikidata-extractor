Here is one story that he heard from Frederick Robert St John, the charg\u00e9 d'affaires at Berne, in 1895. It is not known whether either man embellished it: His most remarkable journey was from Pekin to England by land, long before the Trans\u2013Siberian Railway was dreamed of \u2013 a wonderful feat for that day. It took him six weeks to reach the Siberian frontier, thence by sledge, with a young Russian officer carrying dispatches through Siberia to Nizhny Novgorod. They were eighteen days and nights in a sledge, travelling as hard as relays of three horses could lay their legs to the ground \u2013 and Russian horses can lay them to the ground. I remember Mr. J. Hubbard, of Petersburg, accustomed to Russian sledge travelling, telling me that upon a journey of only three or four days over the Ural Mountains he had to tie up his jaw tight to prevent his teeth being broken by the shocks over what are called roads! I was not surprised when Mr. St. John told me that he did not sleep for six months afterwards, and had never been altogether the same man since. The young Russian officer became delirious at the end of the first week, which terribly aggravated the difficulties and hardships of the journey."]}, {"page": "1901 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Frederick Robert St John, Esq., on retirement of the post of His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Berne"]}]}}
