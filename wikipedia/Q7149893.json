It's a pleasure to be able to say to you, welcome to Channel Four.\" Following the announcement, the channel headed into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station's signature tune, \"Fourscore\", written by David Dundas, which would form the basis of the station's jingles for its first decade. The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime game show Countdown, produced by Yorkshire Television, at 16:45. The first person to be seen on Channel 4 was Richard Whiteley, with Ted Moult being the second. The first woman on the channel, contrary to popular belief, was not Whiteley's Countdown co-host Carol Vorderman, but a lexicographer only ever identified as Mary. Whiteley opened the show with the words: \"As the countdown to a brand new channel ends, a brand new countdown begins.\""]}, {"page": "Press Your Luck", "response": ["| Paul Coia", "An ITV version ran for two seasons from June 6, 1991 to September 20, 1992 on ITV in the HTV West region, with Paul Coia as host. The series was made on a small budget, using a point-based scoring system with the day's winner receiving \u00a3200. This eliminated much of the excitement present in other versions, and declining ratings led to a switch from prime time to Saturday afternoons during the first season. When the show's second season premiered in 1992, it was moved to Sunday afternoons. The show was canceled following the second season due to budget cuts that resulted from the ITV franchise auctions of 1991, as well as lower ratings figures."]}, {"page": "List of game show hosts", "response": ["| Paul Coia || United Kingdom || Catchword (1988\u201395)"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1984", "response": ["| Paul Coia"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985", "response": ["| Paul Coia"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986", "response": ["| Paul Coia"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio Berkshire", "response": ["*Paul Coia (Sunday breakfast)"]}, {"page": "UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest", "response": ["|Paul Coia", "|Paul Coia", "|Paul Coia"]}, {"page": "Split Second (game show)", "response": ["The show ran in the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1988 in the STV region of ITV, hosted by Paul Coia."]}, {"page": "Radio Clyde", "response": ["Notable past presenters include Ross King, who was the station's youngest ever DJ, and is now based in Hollywood, from where he appears regularly on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine.
