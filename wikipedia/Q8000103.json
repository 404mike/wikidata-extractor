He played football for Birmingham Excelsior before joining Birmingham St George's in 1886. He became the star of their attack, and played for them in the Football Alliance, but was one of several players offloaded when the club got into financial difficulties and joined local rivals and fellow Football Alliance club Small Heath in August 1891. He played only once for Small Heath's first team, scoring both goals in a 2\u20132 draw at Ardwick in January 1892, but his career was in decline, and later that year he returned to local football with Summerfield Saints.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wilbert Harrison", "response": ["In 1970, Harrison had some success with \"My Heart Is Yours\", and he toured for many years with a band known as 'Wilbert Harrison and the Roamers', and as a solo act. A follow-up album was released that year, Anything You Want. Reviewing it in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"Let's Work Together was an anachronistic, even primitive r&b album based on the fluke hit of the same name, which makes this the follow-up. Side one consists entirely of roll and rock songs you'd swear you've heard before\u2014'Your Three Letters,' eh, and what's this 'Let's Stick Together,' and why not bring out 'Kansas City' again? Very unprepossessing, very charming. In fact, if the second side weren't all standards and uncharming filler\u2014only 'Sentimental Journey' is even funny\u2014I wouldn't be recommending this to r&b diehards only.\""]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Small Heath began the new year with a 2\u20132 draw at Ardwick, a result highlighted by sound defence and the goalkeeping of Charsley, which left them in fourth place in the Alliance, having played fewer games than two of the three above them.Notes on Sport.

Despite losing several players to representative duty for the Sheffield Association in Glasgow, Sheffield Wednesday enjoyed a comfortable win at home to Small Heath on a pitch with a light covering of snow. In the first 20 minutes, each side scored twice and the visitors had two further \"goals\" disallowed for offside, but on change of ends, Wednesday took control and the match ended 6\u20133. The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent picked out Jenkyns as playing \"a sturdy and able game\".The Alliance. Wednesday v. Small Heath.
