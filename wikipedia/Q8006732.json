He is best known for his nearly completed eight-volume series, Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy, which covered all living and extinct primates known at the time in full detail and contained illustrations created by his wife, Yvonne.  Schooled at King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys in Birmingham and University of Birmingham, he went on to publish 248 works and accumulated a vast collection of primate specimens that are now stored at the Royal College of Surgeons of England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bigfoot", "response": ["Ivan T.

According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, \u00c9.\u00a0Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, in which he included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared the structure of the nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times."]}, {"page": "Pangboche Hand", "response": ["London University primatologist William Charles Osman Hill conducted a physical examination of the pieces that Byrne supplied.

In 1971 Colin Groves recognized the pygmy slow loris (N.\u00a0pygmaeus) as a separate species, and divided N.\u00a0coucang into four subspecies, while in 2001 Groves opined there were three species (N.\u00a0coucang, N.\u00a0pygmaeus, and N.\u00a0bengalensis), and that N.\u00a0coucang had three subspecies (Nycticebus coucang coucang, N.\u00a0c.\u00a0menagensis, and N.\u00a0c.\u00a0javanicus)."]}, {"page": "Giant mouse lemur", "response": ["In 1870, the British zoologist John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus."]}, {"page": "Harold Stranger", "response": ["Stranger was born in IslingtonFree Births, Deaths and Marriages a son of Innes Thomas Stranger(2007, December 01).

After studying slow lorises from Indochina, primatologist Colin Groves proposed that the pygmy slow loris was morphologically unique enough to be considered a distinct species. The validity of this opinion was later corroborated by studies of chromosomal structure, genetic distance determined by protein variation at polymorphic loci, and mitochondrial DNA restriction enzyme analysis."]}, {"page": "Gray slender loris", "response": ["Together with the red slender loris (Loris tardigradus), the grey slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus) is a type of slender loris (genus Loris) in the strepsirrhine primate family Lorisidae. In 1908 Spanish zoologist \u00c1ngel Cabrera first described the Mysore slender loris (Loris tardigradus lydekkerianus) in Chennai, India, which he named for the English naturalist Richard Lydekker. This subspecies was further described by William Charles Osman Hill in his seminal primate book Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy (1953). Hill believed there was one species of slender loris which was further split into six subspecies, two in India and four in Sri Lanka. In 1998 biological anthropologist Colin Groves recognised two species, L. tardigradus and L. lydekkerianus, which have been widely accepted by the scientific community.
