He is currently the Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Sceptic and the Founder and Director of The Free Speech Union. Formerly, he was an Associate Editor at Quillette.A graduate of the University of Oxford, Young briefly worked for The Times before co-founding the London magazine Modern Review in 1991, and edited it until financial difficulties led to its demise in 1995. His 2001 memoir How to Lose Friends & Alienate People details his subsequent employment at Vanity Fair. He then went on to write for The Sun on Sunday, the Daily Mail, The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator. He also served as a judge in seasons five and six of the television show Top Chef. A proponent of free schools, Young co-founded the West London Free School and served as Director of the New Schools Network.\nYoung has been at the centre of several controversies. In 2015, he wrote an article in advocacy of genetically engineered intelligence, which he described as \"progressive eugenics\". In early January 2018, he was briefly a non-executive director on the board of the Office for Students, an appointment from which he resigned within a few days after Twitter posts described as \"misogynistic and homophobic\" were uncovered.
