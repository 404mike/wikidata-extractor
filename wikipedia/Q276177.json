Much of her archaeological work was conducted in Egypt. However, she also worked on expeditions in Zimbabwe, Malta, and South Arabia. Her notable contributions to the field of archaeology include creating a technique for excavating archaeological sites and information on Paleolithic to Predynastic civilizations in Zimbabwe and Egypt. Caton Thompson held many official positions in organizations such as the Prehistoric Society and the Royal Anthropological Institute.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Zimbabwe", "response": ["When white colonialists like Cecil Rhodes first saw the ruins, they saw them as a sign of the great riches that the area would yield to its new masters.

Radiocarbon dates from charcoal and botanicals found beyond the mounds yield older yet scattered dates well into the 6th millennium BCE. Both sites are situated near the shores of Lake Qarun, which was extensively researched for its water level fluctuation, due to shifts in the Nile floods and its effect on human occupation periods.  Kom K and Kom W were both situated within 1 km of the lake during most of its human occupation periods when lake levels were much higher. The first academic fieldwork was carried out by archaeologist Gertrude Caton-Thompson and geologist Elinor Wight Gardner in the three seasons of 1924-5, 1925-6, and 1927-8. Kom K and Kom W yielded archaeological findings that differ from the culture units within the Egyptian Neolithic known at the time leading Caton-Thompson and Gardner to claim the sites as part of Fayum A and B cultures (also called the Faiyumian or Fayum Neolithic). The area has been re-investigated by the URU Fayum Project since 2004 where it has since been threatened by agriculture and development.    "]}]}}
