With Swindon Town 1\u20130 down, Vigouroux saved a first half Billy Clarke penalty to keep his side in the game as the Wiltshire outfit went on to record a 4\u20131 victory. Since making his Swindon Town debut, he quickly established himself in the starting eleven for the side as first choice goalkeeper. He was also praised for his performance in number of matches. On 28 September 2015, Vigouroux had his loan terminated for paying a \u00a350 fine in pennies, but was reinstated by Swindon after he apologised. As a result, Vigouroux missed two matches as a result of his termination; where up until this point, he played in every match. He then was in goal when he was at fault after conceding a goal from Lee Angol when he failed to clear a backpass, in a 2\u20131 loss to Peterborough United. Despite this, Vigouroux continued to remain as the club's first choice goalkeeper. Despite losing 1\u20130 against Burton Albion on 28 December 2015, Vigouroux made a number of saves, including \"two outstanding saves in the first 10 minutes\", resulted in him being named Man of the Match by local newspaper, Swindon Advertiser. His performance resulted in the club unsuccessfully attempt to sign him on a permanent basis on two occasions. However, he soon suffered a leg injury that saw him sidelined for the rest of the season. Despite this, Vigouroux finished the 2015\u201316 season, making 36 appearances in all competitions and kept five clean sheets."]}]}}
