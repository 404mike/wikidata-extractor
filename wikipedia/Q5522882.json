Goff had continued drafting the textbook after leaving academia for the Commercial Bar. At the time, work for junior barristers was limited, and so he spent considerable time working on the book at the Inner Temple library. During this period, Maudsley spent long stretches of time in the United States, and did not respond to Goff's communications. In 1959, Goff was reading a Law Quarterly Review and came across an article written by Maudsley, which he believed to be based heavily on the material they had prepared in their joint lectures. Goff wrote to Maudsley once again, but upon not receiving a reply, concluded that Maudsley \"was signing off and didn't feel able to tell me\". As a junior barrister with a growing practice, Goff realised that if his book was to be completed, he would need a collaborator. A. W. B.

And at this point in English legal history, the law of restitution was still a relatively niche subject.  The House of Lords had only formally recognised the subject recently.  Certain key academics, notably Professor Peter Birks at Oxford and Professor Gareth Jones at Cambridge, had been striving to bring greater awareness and rationalisation to this area of the law.  But at the time the law of restitution was only taught on a handful of postgraduate courses, and few lawyers or judges had any practical experience of it (although this would change rapidly \u2013 in a decision of the House of Lords in 1998 Lord Goff would refer to counsel before the court as \"seasoned warriors in the continuing battle of the swaps\")."]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*2 April \u2013 Gareth Jones, 85, legal academic."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2016", "response": ["*Gareth Jones, 85, British legal academic.Gareth Jones, law don \u2013 obituary"]}, {"page": "Goff & Jones", "response": ["Goff and Jones on the Law of Unjust Enrichment (formerly Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution, usually simply abbreviated to Goff & Jones) is the leading authoritative English law textbook on restitution and unjust enrichment ().
