This led to him having legal difficulties over the licence of his public house. Shanahan consulted the lawyer and politician Timothy Healy who commented: -\n\n\"I had with me to-day a solicitor with his client, a Dublin publican named Phil Shanahan, whose licence is being opposed, and whose house was closed by the military because he was in Jacob's during Easter week. I was astonished at the type of man - about 40 years of age, jolly and respectable. He said he \"rose out\" to have a \"crack at the English\" and seemed not at all concerned at the question of success or failure. He was a Tipperary hurler in the old days. For such a man to join the Rebellion and sacrifice the splendid trade he enjoyed makes one think there are disinterested Nationalists to be found. I thought a publican was the last man in the world to join a rising! Alfred Byrne, M.P., was with him, and is bitter against the Party. I think I can save Shanahan's property.\"He was elected for Dublin Harbour at the 1918 general election, defeating Alfie Byrne. Like other Sinn F\u00e9in MPs he did not take his seat at Westminster, but became a member of the revolutionary D\u00e1il. He represented Dublin Harbour in the First D\u00e1il 1919 to 1921. He was arrested and detained in custody by the British government in April 1920 but was released in time to attend the next meeting of the D\u00e1il on 29 June 1920.\nIn 1921 a general election was held for the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. Republicans used this as an election for the Second D\u00e1il. Shanahan was elected unopposed for the four member Dublin Mid constituency. He was defeated at the 1922 general election to the Third D\u00e1il, as a member of the Anti-Treaty faction of Sinn F\u00e9in (which opposed the creation of the Irish Free State in the place of the Republic declared in 1919).\nHe left Dublin in 1928 and returned to his home town of Hollyford, County Tipperary.\nHe died on 21 November 1931, aged 57.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
