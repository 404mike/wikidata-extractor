The expansion of the concept coincided with the expansion of the king's household to encompass governmental institutions, including the chancery, exchequer, chamber, and royal courts of law. Under the reigns of \u00c6thelred and Cnut, the concept of king's peace had already extended to designated times, places, individuals, and institutions.John Hudson, The Oxford History of the Laws of England, Vol. 2 (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 386\u201388. Individuals and institutions under the king's peace included legates, churches, and assemblies.", "The Charter of Henry I, issued upon Henry's coronation in 1100, stated: \"I establish a lasting peace throughout the whole of my kingdom and command that it henceforth be maintained.\" Historian John Hudson had commented that Henry I's cornational declaration of peace was non-specific, but did emphasize \"the association of both the ideals and the practical enforcement of good order with firm kingship\" as characterized by, among other things, an expansion of royal judicial activity. Hudson writes: \"Thus the later precise legal notion of the king's peace may have developed more from ideas of the general king's peace, as manifest perhaps in shrieval grants and Henry's coronation decree, than from specific grants of royal protection.\""]}, {"page": "University of Michigan Law School", "response": ["*John Hudson \u2013 English legal historian"]}, {"page": "John Hudson", "response": ["John Hudson is the name of:", "* John Hudson (classicist) (1662\u20131719), English classical scholar", "* John Hudson (Shakespeare scholar)", "* John Hudson (historian), English medieval historian", "* John Hudson (mathematician) (1773\u20131843), English mathematician and senior wrangler", "* John Hudson (Indian Army officer) (1833\u20131893), British general", "* John Hudson (footballer) (1860\u20131941), English footballer", "* John Hudson (cricketer) (1882\u20131961), Australian cricketer", "* John Hudson (golfer) (born 1945), English golfer", "* John Hudson (basketball, born 1954), American former basketball player", "* John Hudson (basketball, born 1966), American former basketball player", "* John Hudson (American football) (born 1968), American NFL football player", "* John Hudson (rower) (born 1940), Australian Olympic rower", "* John Hudson (bishop) (1904\u20131981), Australian Anglican bishop", "* John Hudson (actor) (1919\u20131996), older brother of actor William Hudson", "* John Hudson (journalist) (born 1956), New Zealand reporter", "* John Hudson (theatre director) (born 1962), Canadian theatre producer and director, and politician in Alberta"]}, {"page": "History of English land law", "response": ["*John Hudson, Land, Law, and Lordship in Anglo-Norman England (Paperback edn OUP 1997) "]}, {"page": "John G.
