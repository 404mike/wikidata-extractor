He was born in Selly Oak, Birmingham and died at Bournbrook, also in Birmingham.\nCooke was a tail-end right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. In his second first-class match, the game against Kent at The Nevill Ground, Tunbridge Wells in July 1925, he finished off the Kent first innings with a hat-trick of three wickets in three balls, in fact taking four wickets in five balls; later in the same match, he was himself part of a hat-trick taken by the Kent bowler Charlie Wright which finished off the Warwickshire second innings. Cooke's figures of five wickets for 22 runs in Kent's first innings were by some distance the best of his career, and in no other innings in a brief first-class career did he take more than two wickets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Cooke", "response": ["Robert Cooke may refer to:", "*Robert Cooke (Conservative politician) (1930\u20131987), British Conservative Party politician", "*Robert Cooke (Parliamentarian) (1598\u20131643), English politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1640 and 1643", "*Robert Cooke (officer of arms) (died 1593), herald, Clarenceux King of Arms under Elizabeth I of England", "*Robert Cooke (organist) (1768\u20131814), English organist", "*Robert Cooke (physician) (1880\u20131960), American researcher into allergies", "*Robert Cooke (Warwickshire cricketer) (1900\u20131957), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Robert Cooke (1925\u20131926) : R.

Both his best batting and bowling performances came in the 1924 season, relatively early in his first-class career. Against Essex in June 1924 in the second innings he scored 81, putting on 157 in about 75 minutes for the eighth wicket with the debutant Alan Hilder, which stood as the Kent record for that wicket until 2007. In August of the same year, he took five Somerset wickets for 33 runs in the first innings and followed that with seven for 31 in the second innings, providing both his best innings and match figures. In 1925, in the match against Warwickshire, Wright was the first victim in a sequence of four wickets in five balls by the Warwickshire player Robert Cooke; in Warwickshire's second innings, Wright returned the favour with a hat-trick in which Cooke was one of his victims."]}, {"page": "Robert Cooke (cricketer, born 1900)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Cooke (Warwickshire cricketer)"]}]}}
