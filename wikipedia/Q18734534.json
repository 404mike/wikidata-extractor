The Quaker values of frugal living, avoiding debt and keeping regular accounts served him well when he set up one of the first brass and iron foundries in East Anglia near White-Friars Bridge, Norwich. He obtained a patent for iron roofing tiles in 1783, and another for tempered cast iron plough shares some 18 months later. In 1789, he moved with his family and one employee named William Rush to Ipswich, where he started casting ploughshares in a disused malting at St Margaret's Ditches, with capital of \u00a3200. It was not an obvious place to go, as the town had been in decline for more than a century, and the Ipswich Corporation was almost insolvent due to huge debts.", "In 1809 Robert Ransome, now aged 56, was looking for someone younger to take the business forwards. His eldest son James returned from Great Yarmouth to become his father's partner, bringing with him several of his skilled craftsmen. Now called Ransome and Son, the business prospered, with output doubling over the next six years. Another period of social unrest followed, with agricultural depression and the introduction of the Corn Laws in 1815. Robert had employed William Cubitt in 1812 as the company engineer, and they diversified so they were not solely dependent on the sale of agricultural products. They cast the components for Stoke Bridge, Ipswich, which was swept away in a flood in 1818. Cubitt was responsible for the new design, and the bridge lasted for over 100 years. Cubitt's designs for wind-regulating vanes for windmills and a treadmill for grinding corn in prisons were also manufactured, and he then supervised the installation of gas lighting in Ipswich, which included the construction of a gasometer near to the foundry. Cubbitt became a partner in the firm in 1821, but continued to carry out consultancy work in his own right. He was in such demand that he moved on in 1826, to pursue his civil engineering career, for which he was later knighted.", "The business begun by Robert Ransome was later owned as partners by various individuals.

It was Robert Ransome who took out the first patent for manufacturing cast-iron chilled ploughshares, and thus by making the under-side much harder than the upper, preserving a sharp cutting edge to the share. The use of this process in turning out ploughshares is now almost universal, both in this country and America. The chief business of the establishment is still the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery; although the firm is also extensively recognised in conjunction with railway works and improvements. Upwards of three thousand miles of \" line\" in the United Kingdom, and nearly two thousand more in other parts of the world, are now laid down and maintained on the patent known as Ransome and May's."]}, {"page": "James Ransome (manufacturer)", "response": ["He was born in 1782, the elder son of Robert Ransome, founder of the manufacturer of agricultural implements (later known as Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies) in Ipswich, Suffolk.

In 1818 Ransome, with his brother James and John Shewell established a small coke oven in their foundry in Old Foundry Street. Their employee, William Cubitt, made sure that the gas produced by the coke plant was collected and distributed at first to Carr Street, Tavern Street and on the Cornhill."]}, {"page": "Ransome, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Ransome"]}]}}
