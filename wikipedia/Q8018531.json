He made his first-class debut for a Kent side against an England team in 1840 before the formation of the first Kent County Cricket Club in 1842. He played for the side in 1842 and 1844 in the same fixture before emigrating to South Australia at some point during the early 1850s.Smith is known to have played cricket in Australia and was one of the first wicket-keepers to wear pads and gloves in Australia. He worked as a government official at Port Augusta but had returned to live in Gravesend by 1856 when he played three times for Kent. His final first-class appearance came the following year.Smith was married and in later life was a publican in Gravesend and nearby Milton. He died in 1883 aged 63 or 64.", "link_mentions": {}}}
