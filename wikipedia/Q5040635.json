From the age of 16 Kennet was a regular in the reserve side for the following two years. Throughout this period Kennet captained the youth side. He was then given his first professional contract at the age of 18 by manager Darren Patterson. On 1 January 2007 Kennet made his league debut for Oxford against Exeter City. However, his first over-enthusiastic tackle earned him a yellow card, but minutes later Kennet redeemed himself by slotting a ball through for an assist for Carl Pettefer. After the arrival of Jim Smith, opportunities in the first team were few and far between and Kennet spent most of his time on the bench and playing regularly for the reserves. When an opportunity for a loan spell at neighbouring Didcot Town arose, Kennet took the opportunity and finished the season as Didcot Town star player."]}, {"page": "2005 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["The match kicked off around 3p.m. on 28 May 2005 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in front of 19,653 spectators.   The match was an even affair during the first half: early on, Francis Green's header for Lincoln was off-target, and the team then saw a goal from Yeo ruled out.  Southend had two goal-bound chances cleared as the Lincoln goalkeeper Alan Marriott saved shots from both Carl Pettefer and Mark Bentley.  Southend dominated the second half, with Eastwood creating the best chance in the 56th minute but falling over the ball with only Marriott to beat from around .  Green then blocked a shot from Southend's Che Wilson before Bentley was denied a penalty after Paul Morgan appeared to foul him. Regular time ended goalless, sending the match into extra time.  Jamie Jackson, writing in The Observer, described the first 90 minutes of the match as \"tepid, uninventive fare\".   The first goal was scored just before half-time in the first period of extra time.  Spencer Prior flicked on Nicolau's corner and Eastwood struck Matt Bloomer's clearance into the Lincoln goal to make it 1\u20130.  With ten minutes of extra time remaining, Eastwood ran at the Lincoln defence and passed the ball square to Duncan Jupp who scored his first league goal in a decade to give Southend a 2\u20130 lead. With no further additions to the scoreline, the match ended 2\u20130 and Southend secured promotion to League One.", "|RM ||10 ||Carl Pettefer"]}, {"page": "2005 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|LM ||10 || Carl Pettefer || || || "]}, {"page": "2004 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|CM ||28 ||Carl Pettefer"]}]}}
