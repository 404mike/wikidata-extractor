His father was a banker of Stroud, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Amersham School.  After joining Thomas Hunt as partner in Cam Mill (previously known as Corrietts Mill) he moved to Cam, Gloucestershire, where he was a cloth manufacturer. He built a house at Norman Hill, Dursley, Gloucestershire.In 1885 Winterbotham was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Cirencester. He held the seat until his death in 1892 aged 54.Winterbotham married Elizabeth Strachan in 1863 and had two sons Arthur and Herbert.

This was a substantially-sized constituency fairly similar in its boundaries to the modern Cotswold District Council, with a strong rural element but including a number of small towns apart from Cirencester - Chipping Campden, Fairford, Moreton-in-Marsh, Tetbury and Stow-on-the-Wold among them. In character it proved more Liberal than Cirencester borough had done, though this may have been as much from the dilution of the Bathurst influence as from political factors - consequently instead of being a safe Conservative seat it was generally a knife-edge marginal. Arthur Winterbotham, the Liberal who had won the constituency by 700 votes at its first election, in 1885, was re-elected unopposed when he became a Liberal Unionist in 1886, but when he switched back to the Liberals at the next general election his majority fell to 153. Winterbotham died later the same year, and the by-election was decided in favour of the Conservative candidate, Colonel Thomas Chester-Master, by just 3 votes; but his defeated opponent petitioned against the result and after further scrutiny of the ballots the result was revised and declared to be tied. It was impossible at this stage to give a casting vote to the returning officer (the usual solution to a tied election at that period), so the election had to be run again.", "|rowspan=\"3\"| Arthur Winterbotham"]}, {"page": "1892 vote of no confidence in the Salisbury ministry", "response": ["With 665 Members of Parliament taking part (the 660 voting, two tellers from each side and the Speaker in the Chair), the no confidence vote of 1892 was later acknowledged as the 'greatest division' of all time in the House of Commons in the sense of having the most Members taking part.\"The division upon the 'No confidence' amendment last night is the heaviest on record\" \u2013 \"Political Notes\", The Times, 12 August 1892, p. 10.
