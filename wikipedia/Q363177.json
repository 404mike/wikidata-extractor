Whilst considering whether to accept Kidderminster's new contract offer or to play higher-level football, Lowe said it was \"a choice between my head and my heart\", implying his heart lay at Aggborough Stadium. He decided to remain with Kidderminster in part due to his reverence for manager John Eustace, signing a new contract in June 2016, and was named as club captain in August. Lowe scored five goals in 51 appearances in 2016\u201317, helping Kidderminster to a second-place finish before they suffered defeat in the play-off semi-final to sixth-place Chorley.
