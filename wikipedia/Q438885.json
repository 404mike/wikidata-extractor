He is a founding member of the bands Joy Division, New Order, and Electronic.  Sumner was an early force in several areas, including the post-punk, synthpop, and techno music scenes, as well as their various related genres, and was an early influence on the Manchester music scene that presaged the \"Madchester\" movement of the late 1980s centered on Factory Records and The Ha\u00e7ienda club in Manchester.  \nHe began his career playing guitar and keyboards for Joy Division, and after the band regrouped following lead singer Ian Curtis's death, they renamed themselves New Order and Sumner took on lead vocal duties.  His complex electronic compositions became less guitar-driven and more focused on electronic keyboards, synthesizers, and programming throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  He formed Electronic in collaboration with Johnny Marr and Neil Tennant in the early 1990s, and New Order broke up for the first time in the late 1990s, giving Sumner a chance to focus on Electronic.  New Order reformed in the early 2000s, but broke up a second time in 2007, at which point he returned to a more traditional rock context with the band Bad Lieutenant.  He continues to record and perform with the latest iteration of New Order, which had reformed in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 4", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Bernard Sumner, English singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer "]}, {"page": "Joy Division", "response": ["Joy Division were  an English rock band formed in Salford in 1976.

Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\". The following day Hook borrowed \u00a335 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\"", "Joy Division took time to develop their style and quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as fairly generic and \"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \"really became apparent as the songs got slower\", and their music took on a \"sparse\" quality. According to Reynolds, \"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\" By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands).", "* Bernard Sumner \u2013 lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, bass (1976\u20131980)", " bar:Bernard text:\"Bernard Sumner\""]}, {"page": "New Order (band)", "response": ["New Order are  an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris.

It included work by The Cure (their song, \"Burn\", became the film's main theme), The Jesus and Mary Chain, Rage Against the Machine and Helmet, among many others. In Peter Hook's memoir Substance: Inside New Order, Hook relates that New Order were approached to provide the soundtrack for the film, with a cover of \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", their hit as Joy Division, citing parallels between Eric's resurrection and New Order's formation after the suicide of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis. However, New Order frontman Bernard Sumner declined, stating that they were too busy with their album Republic to commit to another project. James O'Barr, creator of the original comic book series, was a big fan of Joy Division and had named the characters Sergeant Albrecht and Captain Hook after bandmates Sumner (who was also known as Bernard Albrecht early in his career) and Hook."]}, {"page": "Revenge (UK band)", "response": ["It has often been speculated that the band's name referred to Hook seeking revenge on Bernard Sumner for the latter's formation of the band Electronic with Johnny Marr.

Their first album, Music for Pleasure, was released in 1997. Some critics remarked on the similarities to New Order's sound, owing to Hook's recognisable bass style and the resemblance between Potts' vocal style and Bernard Sumner's.

Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert fades in a sequenced melody, out of sync with the beat because she had forgotten to input a note into the sequencer. The verse section features the song's signature throbbing synth bassline, played on a Moog Source, overlaid with Peter Hook's bass guitar leads. The synth bassline was sequenced on a Powertran Sequencer home built by Sumner. Bernard Sumner delivers the lyrics in a deadpan manner. \"Blue Monday\" is an atypical hit song in that it does not feature a standard verse-chorus structure. After a lengthy introduction, the first and second verses are contiguous and are separated from the third verse only by a brief series of sound effects. A short breakdown section follows the third verse, which leads to an extended outro.", "The band stated that the song was written in response to crowd disappointment at the fact that they never played encores. The song was planned to allow them to return to the stage, press play on a synthesiser and leave the stage again, but while writing the song it evolved into a project that the band quite liked, and it was turned from an experiment into a single. However, the band since have become noted for playing \"Blue Monday\" as an encore. \"Blue Monday\" was influenced by several songs. Hook said the song was \"stolen\" from the Donna Summer song \"Our Love\" from the Bad Girls album. Bernard Sumner said part of the arrangement came from \"Dirty Talk\", by Klein + M.B.O, the synthesised bassline from Sylvester's \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\".  Hook's bassline was derived from an Ennio Morricone soundtrack, For a Few Dollars More: Hook said \"I stole it\" after watching the film of the same name in the studio. In the Guardian, Clinton Heylin included \"Blue Monday\" on a list of \"10 classic stolen pop songs\" and said that the starting point for the song came from \"Gerry and the Holograms\", the 1979 title track by the novelty group of the same name, but Sumner denied this. Some rhythmic and synthesizer elements of the song had been used by the band in an earlier composition, \"Video 5 8 6\", in 1982, which evolved into the track \"5 8 6\", appearing on the band's 1983 album Power, Corruption & Lies.", "* Bernard Sumner \u2013 vocals, keyboards, programming", "Category:Songs written by Bernard Sumner"]}, {"page": "Technique (album)", "response": ["In the late 1980s, the band felt that they had to keep on playing with dance-electronic rhythms.

The way I saw it was we were still writing band music as well, so we'd reached a compromise.\" Peter Hook joked that the album was \"an epic power struggle between the sequencers and me.
