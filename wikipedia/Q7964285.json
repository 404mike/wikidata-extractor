In the next quarter of an hour, the Professionals hit the frame of the goal three times. On the first occasion, Benjamin Howard Baker rushed out of goal but failed to collect Ernie Simms' shot; the ball struck the foot of the post, and Gates was able to clear before it spun back into the net. Then a shot from Jimmy Walsh and a volley by Jack Elkes each struck a post, rebounded into play, and were cleared by the defence. Soon afterwards, Simms suffered a leg strain. He played on, limping on the wing, until half-time, but took no part in the second half. After 35 minutes, Ashton scored his second goal, in similar fashion to the first; he trapped Bellamy's cross and shot hard into the corner. In what remained of the first half, Frank Macey had two close-range shots, \"but both were saved most brilliantly\" by Harry Hardy.", "|Forward|| Walter Bellamy||Dulwich Hamlet||"]}, {"page": "1926 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["The match began with a fine exhibition of passing by the Amateurs, but six minutes into the game David Jack fed Bill Rawlings who scored from close range to give the Professionals the lead. The lead was doubled in similar fashion after 24 minutes. Rawlings had another two chances which he failed to take, and the Professionals seemed to be in control of the game. With half an hour gone, the Amateurs \"added dash and determination to their pattern-work passing\", and the tenor of the game changed dramatically. A neat pass from Frank Macey was touched over the line by Edgar Kail, and a couple of minutes later Wilfred Minter hooked home after some \"brilliant interpassing\" between Macey and his left-wing partner Walter Bellamy. The score at the half-time interval remained 2\u20132.", "|Forward|| Walter Bellamy||Dulwich Hamlet||"]}, {"page": "Frank Macey", "response": ["Macey made his debut for the England amateur team against Ireland at Selhurst Park in November 1923.\"Amateur international.\" Daily Mirror: p. 14. 10 November 1923.

The Irish Times wrote that Macey's \"zeal was a tonic in itself\", but attributed England's low score as \"probably due to the over anxiety of Macey, who, while giving much entertainment to the crowd, was rather disappointing in front of the net.\"\"Amateur international. Irishmen outclassed at the Palace\". Irish Times: p. 11. 12 November 1923. He received his next call-up for the England amateur XI two years later, again for a match against Ireland, this time at Maidstone.

The Times: p. 6. 9 November 1925. Playing against Ireland for a third time, in Belfast in November 1926, he scored a tap-in in a 3\u20130 win. He, Edgar Kail and Vivian Gibbins \"did splendid work\" in \"a well-balanced forward line\", according to the Daily Express.\"England supreme.\" Daily Express: p. 12. 8 November 1926."]}]}}
