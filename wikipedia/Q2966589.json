His years of loyalty earned him the trust of the Yorkists, and his victories\u2014both political and military\u2014and popularity with the common people made him an important figure. He had powerful influence over the line of succession, earning him the nickname \"The Kingmaker\". Early historians described him as a military genius, but by the 20th century his tactical acumen was reconsidered; Philip Haigh suspects that the Earl largely owed some of his victories, such as the First Battle of St Albans, to being in the right place at the right time. Christopher Gravett believes the Earl was too defensive and lacked mental flexibility."]}, {"page": "Drogo of Hauteville", "response": ["*Christopher Gravett and David Nicolle.
