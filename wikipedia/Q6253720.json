An Air Training Corps cadet, 16-year-old Derek Coates, was with him in the rear compartment of the aircraft when the force of the impact caused the Wellington to break up and plunge to the ground out of control.\nFlight Lieutenant Quinton picked up the only parachute he could see, clipped it on to the cadet's harness, showed him how to pull the rip-cord and ordered him to jump. The cadet landed safely and was the only survivor of the disaster; all eight other occupants of the two aircraft perished.\nFor his selfless action he was awarded the George Cross (GC), the UK's highest award for bravery where the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not applicable, such as acts of gallantry by a civilian, or by a military person who is not in the presence of the enemy. The George Cross is equal in status to the Victoria Cross, but as the newer award, in order of wear, the George Cross is second to the Victoria Cross.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RAF Leeming", "response": ["* 13 August 1951 \u2013 two aircraft from RAF Leeming collided over Hudswell, near to Richmond, North Yorkshire.
