Kelsey was a right-handed batsman. He was born at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and was educated at Repton School.\nKelsey made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Worcestershire at the County Ground, Hove, in the 1902 County Championship. Sussex won the toss and elected to bat first, making 399/7 declared, during which Kelsey scored a single run before he was dismissed by George Simpson-Hayward. Worcestershire were then dismissed in their first-innings for 197, with Sussex forcing them to follow-on in their second-innings, with Worcestershire making 240 all out, which left Sussex with a target of 39 for victory. Sussex reached their target in their second-innings without losing any wickets. This was his only major appearance for Sussex.\nOutside of cricket, he was a brewer. He died at Wadhurst, Sussex, on 21 October 1945.", "link_mentions": {}}}
