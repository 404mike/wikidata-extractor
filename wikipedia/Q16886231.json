Amongst other things, the theory states that the self is not a foundational aspect of cognition, but rather that the self is an outcome of cognitive processes and an interaction between the person and the social context. The self-categorization theory was developed as a companion theory to the social identity theory, and the two theories taken together are known as the social identity approach.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of psychologists", "response": ["* John Turner, collaborated with Tajfel on social identity theory and later developed self-categorization theory"]}, {"page": "Self-concept", "response": ["The self-categorization theory developed by John Turner states that the self-concept consists of at least two \"levels\": a personal identity and a social one. In other words, one's self-evaluation relies on self-perceptions and how others perceive them. Self-concept can alternate rapidly between one's personal and social identity. Children and adolescents begin integrating social identity into their own self-concept in elementary school by assessing their position among peers. By age five, acceptance from peers significantly affects children's self-concept, affecting their behaviour and academic success."]}, {"page": "John Turner (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Turner (1929\u20132020) was the 17th Prime Minister of Canada.", "John Turner may also refer to:", "*John Turner (1737\u20131787), English potter of the Turner family", "*John Turner (lyricist) (born 1932), English lyricist", "*John Turner (actor) (born 1932), British actor", "*\"Uncle\" John Turner (1933\u20132007), American drummer of Johnny Winter Band", "*John Nathan-Turner n\u00e9 John Turner (1947\u20132002), British television producer", "*John Turner, a Canadian comedic actor associated with the clown duo Mump and Smoot", "*John Turner (MP for Bletchingley), MP for Bletchingley in 1601", "*John Turner (died 1712), British Member of Parliament for King's Lynn", "*Sir John Turner, 2nd Baronet, British Member of Parliament for King's Lynn in 1712", "*Sir John Turner, 3rd Baronet, British Member of Parliament for King's Lynn in 1739\u20131768", "*John Turner (Australian politician) (born 1949)", "*John Turner (Illinois politician) (born 1956), American politician and judge", "*John Turner (Texas politician) (born 1974), Texas state representative", "*John Turner (cricketer, born 1816) (1816\u20131892), Cambridge University cricketer and clergyman", "*John Turner (cricketer, born 1863) (1863\u20131924), Cambridge University cricketer and lawyer", "*John Turner (cricketer, born 2001)", "*John Turner (1890s footballer), English football player for Manchester United", "*John Turner (Minor Counties cricketer) (1949\u20132012), former English cricketer", "*John Turner (footballer, born 1954), English football goalkeeper", "*John Turner (American football) (born 1956), former National Football League player", "*John Turner (basketball) (born 1967), American former basketball player", "*John Turner (footballer, born 1986), English football forward", "*John Turner (Mayflower passenger) (c. 1590\u20131651)", "*John Turner (fl. 1668\u20131676), New England merchant for whom the House of the Seven Gables in Salem, Massachusetts was built", "*John Turner (archdeacon of Taunton) (died 1817), English Anglican priest, archdeacon of Taunton", "*John Turner (bishop) (died 1831), Anglican bishop", "*John Turner (architect) (1806\u20131890), English architect", "*John Turner (fur trapper) (1807\u20131847), American fur trapper and investor in the Willamette Cattle Company", "*John Turner (naval officer) (1864\u20131949), Australian naval officer", "*John Turner (anarchist) (1865\u20131934), Scottish anarchist and trade union leader", "*John Turner (Archdeacon of Basingstoke) (1867\u20131952), English Anglican priest, archdeacon of Winchester", "*John Turner (psychologist) (1947\u20132011), British social psychologist", "*John Turner, a character in the 1891 Sherlock Holmes short story \"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\""]}, {"page": "Alexander Haslam", "response": ["Haslam grew up in Elsenham, Essex and completed his secondary education at Felsted School.
