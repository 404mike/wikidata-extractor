In 1846 he enrolled at J.M.Leigh's drawing Academy at 79 Newman Street, where he was the youngest pupil, and, in 1851 at the Royal Academy in London. Recent research has unearthed details of more than one hundred works by Goodman. The present whereabouts of most these are unknown, notable exceptions being The Printseller's Window (c. 1882), acquired by the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester in 1998, portraits of actresses Mary Anne Keeley (also known as Mrs. Keeley at Fourscore) and Fanny Stirling (1885), both in the collection of London's Garrick Club, A Kitchen Cabinet (1882) in a private collection in the US, and a Cuban scene, Home of the Bamboo, in a private collection in Sweden. Several sketches, paintings and water colours, are still in the possession of Walter Goodman's descendants.", "link_mentions": {}}}
