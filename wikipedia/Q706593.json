McMahon was placed in 42nd position in the '100 Players Who Shook The Kop' poll, which asked Red supporters to name the best 100 Liverpool players of all time. He also played for Everton, Aston Villa and Manchester City, playing in the Premier League for the latter. He was capped 17 times by England.\nAfter his playing career ended, he began his coaching and managing career with Swindon Town, and later managed Blackpool, winning a promotion with both of these clubs.

McMahon then succeeded in getting Swindon back into Division One on his first attempt, winning the Division Two championship in 1995\u201396.

The majority of key players were in their late 20s or early 30s when he took over, and some appeared to have passed their peak. He knew they had eventually to be replaced and he doubted some of their desire. He claims in his book the senior players also appeared not to want to listen to him and may have resented his disciplinarian approach to their behaviour, and also claimed a number of players \u2013 including Peter Beardsley and Steve McMahon \u2013 asked for improved terms in their contracts or they would move elsewhere. In the end, Beardsley, McMahon and Houghton were sold, seemingly before suitable replacements were found and these key components of Kenny Dalglish's great side were not adequately replaced. Souness claimed Ian Rush and Ray Houghton had also demanded to know why new signings like Mark Wright were earning more money than them, despite not yet having won any trophies. The sale of Peter Beardsley to local rivals Everton was a controversial move, and the player did well for Everton in his two seasons there, and continued to do well despite his advancing years during four seasons at Newcastle United."]}, {"page": "World in Motion", "response": ["A rap is performed by England player John Barnes towards the end of the track.

In his final season at the club, 1988\u201389, he made just five competitive appearances before he later had spells on loan at his old club Leicester and also at Rangers. In April 1989, shortly before he left Liverpool, MacDonald, along with his teammates, rallied round the bereaved families of the Hillsborough disaster.MacDonald attends Hillsborough victim's funeral: Liverpool Echo.
