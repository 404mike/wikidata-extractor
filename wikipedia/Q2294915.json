By the 1620s, the Shoreditch amphitheaters had become deeply identified with the louder and less reputable categories of play-goers, such as apprentices.

Brome's Sparagus Garden was a huge success at the Salisbury Court in 1635, earning over \u00a31000. As a result, Brome signed a three-year contract with Richard Heton, manager of the Salisbury Court, to write three plays annually at a salary of 15 shillings per week plus one day's profit per play. Brome, however, was unable to produce dramas at the promised pace; and the stipulated payments to Brome were not kept up. In need of money, Brome resorted to Christopher Beeston, actor, impresario, and owner of the Cockpit Theatre (also known as the Phoenix) as well as the Red Bull. In August 1635 Beeston loaned Brome \u00a36, and in return Brome committed to write Beeston a play. Heton tried to lure Brome back with a \u00a310 payment for a new play; but they fell behind in his payments again, and Brome turned again to Beeston. Heton appealed to Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels, to settle the dispute; Herbert decreed that Brome be paid six shillings a week and \u00a35 for each new play, the payments to continue even when the theaters were closed."]}, {"page": "King's Men (playing company)", "response": ["May 1605 brought the death of Augustine Phillips.

Beeston's rapid restoration of the playhouse after this riot may be why it was sometimes called the Phoenix. Like earlier theatres, such as The Theatre in Shoreditch and The Globe in Southwark, the location was just outside the jurisdiction of the City of London.

The creation of a company of boy actors was a return to a practice of the early 17th century, the era of companies like the Children of Paul's and the Children of the Chapel. Those companies, while controversial in their time, had been effective at developing and educating young talent, to the eventual benefit of the adult companies and the theatrical profession as a whole. Beeston's formation of the Young Company was an attempt to recover that training function \u2013 as well as to provide effective drama while paying relatively less in actors' salaries.", "The King and Queen's Young Company was onstage in early 1637, and was a hit; they and their reputation quickly entered public consciousness under their popular nickname.

(This period of crisis would likely have been difficult to navigate, even for a very resourceful individual.) William Beeston inherited the Phoenix theatre from his father and everything that went with it, which included the young company Beeston's Boys. While Beeston had none of the experience that his father had, he still took on the mantle of managing the company since he had \"a one-twelfth interest in the King and Queen\u2019s young company\"Bentley, Gerald Eades.

Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2005. Print. The last play, The Court Beggar, got Beeston's Boys in a severe amount of trouble that resulted in William Davenant taking over the theatre for an interim time. By possessing such a large repertoire, the Beeston's Boys were able to quickly get up and running and compete with such acting companies like the Queen's Men. William Beeston was then sworn as governor of the company to succeed his father on 5 April 1639 (Bentley 1:330)", "The relationship between Lord Chamberlain Pembroke and Christopher Beeston was so close that it greatly advantaged the company. \"Now running a company of youths...enjoying the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s direct support, and retaining all the old Queen\u2019s Men\u2019s rich repertoire, Beeston\u2019s position was strong indeed\" (Butler 113).
