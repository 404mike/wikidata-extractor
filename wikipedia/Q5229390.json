He signed for Middlesbrough a couple of seasons later but failed to make a first team league appearance. His career was interrupted by the Second World War. Miller was drafted into the RAF in 1940 as a PTI (Physical Training Instructor) and spent two years training servicemen in Canada. On returning to England he was stationed at various RAF bases and guested for local league teams when league football resumed. A subsequent move to Wolverhampton Wanderers gained him three League games before a serious leg muscle injury sidelined him for a season. A move to Derby County brought him a single appearance in half a season.Doncaster were having a surprisingly bad season and were wanting to make improvements, so they brought Miller to Belle Vue in January 1948. In his 5 1/2 seasons there he helped them win the Division 3 North title and sustain their place in Division 2. He made 146 appearances, scored 4 goals, and had a spell as captain. He left to Aldershot in March 1953.\nAt the end of the season with the 'Shots, he transferred to Boston United. Whilst there he was a regular feature, clocking up 192 games and 15 goals. He was in the side that won in the FA Cup second round at Derby County 6\u22121 in 1955, and was considered man of the match in the game at Tottenham Hotspur in the next round.Miller died in 1989, aged 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dave Miller", "response": ["Dave Miller may refer to:", "* Dave Miller (baseball) (born 1966), American baseball player and coach", "* Dave Miller (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20131989), English footballer", "* Dave Miller (footballer, born 1964), English footballer", "* Dave Miller (musician) (fl. 2000s), American musician, co-founder of rock band Senses Fail", "* Dave Miller (New Zealand musician), New Zealand-born musician, leader of Australian band, Dave Miller Set", "* Dave Miller (producer) (1925\u20131985), American popular-music record producer", "* Dave Miller (Waterloo Road), a fictional character in the TV series Waterloo Road", "* Dave Miller (broadcaster), American broadcaster", "* Dave Miller (singer-songwriter) (born 1952), American singer-songwriter", "* Dave Miller (cyclist) (born 1960), English track and road cyclist"]}, {"page": "Dave Miller (footballer born 1921)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Miller (footballer, born 1921)"]}]}}
