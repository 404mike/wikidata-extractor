He played football as an inside forward for Derby County between 1959 and 1967, before brief spells with Luton Town, Notts County, Port Vale, and non-league Ilkeston Town. He played a total of 215 league games in the English Football League, helping Luton Town to the Fourth Division title in 1967\u201368, also helping Port Vale to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1969\u201370. He also played cricket for Derbyshire from 1959 to 1973, serving the county as captain between 1970 and 1972.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 1", "response": ["*2010 \u2013 Ian Buxton, English footballer and cricketer (b. 1938)"]}, {"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["In preparation for the 1969\u201370 campaign he released Mick Cullerton, Mick Mahon, Jimmy Goodfellow, Graham Williams, and Milija Aleksic; whilst top-scorer Roy Chapman rejected a new contract and signed with Chester City. Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\"."]}, {"page": "2010 in association football", "response": ["* 1 October - Ian Buxton, English striker (72)"]}, {"page": "Buxton (surname)", "response": ["* Ian Buxton (1938\u20132010), English footballer and cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Ian Buxton"]}, {"page": "Ian Raymond Buxton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Buxton"]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["| 1970 || 25|| 7 || 7 || 11 || 7 || 16|| 11|| 5|| 0|| 3||R2 || ||Ian Buxton || || ||", "| 1971|| 26 || 1 || 6 || 19 || 17 ||16 || 7|| 8|| 1|| 11 || R2|| || Ian Buxton|| Ian Hall || Philip Russell || Bob Taylor", "| 1972 || 22 ||2 || 5 ||15 || 17 || 16|| 7|| 7|| 2 || 9 ||R2 || Grp||Ian Buxton || || ||"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1959", "response": ["The team included a considerable amount of fresh blood with Bob Berry Ian Buxton, Peter Eyre, Ian Hall, William Oates and William Richardson, all of whom had sustained careers with Derbyshire.

Five of these results were goalless draws, as the defence proved stronger than the attack following the departure of top-scorer Roy Chapman at the end of the previous season. Nevertheless, the run put them at the top of the table, and Lee credited his team's hard work and fitness. John James played on despite an injured ankle, Mick Morris found himself a permanent fixture as an energetic utility man, whilst Tommy McLaren also worked his way into the first eleven. The defence conceded just six goals in the opening fifteen league games. The run included a 1\u20130 win over Chesterfield at Saltergate, a 2\u20130 win over nearby Crewe Alexandra in front of a season-best Burslem crowd of 12,538, and a 'war of attrition' in a 1\u20131 draw 'full of ugly incidents' with Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground in front of a crowd of 19,946. Their 22 November fixture at the Old Showground with Scunthorpe United could have seen the Vale equal the best start to an English League season in the twentieth century. After a Wookey goal put them ahead they lost after a disputed penalty and a bizarre own goal from Roy Sproson.
