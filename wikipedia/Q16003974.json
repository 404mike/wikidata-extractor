According to some he was a cousin of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. Charles Zachary Barnett was the younger brother of the composer John Barnett, for whom he wrote the libretti for two of his operas, Fair Rosamond (1837), in which he 'perversely reduced the story to the level of burlesque'; and Farinelli (1839). He also wrote several plays including early adaptations of the works of Charles Dickens, such as the three-act burletta Oliver Twist; Or, The Parish Boy's Progress, which opened at the Theatre Royal, Marylebone on 21 May 1838. It was only the second stage production of the work, as Dickens had not yet completed the novel. Barnett also wrote A Christmas Carol: Or, the Miser's Warning!, a two-act adaptation of A Christmas Carol first produced at the Surrey Theatre on 5 February 1844, just weeks after the publication of the novella.Other plays written by Barnett include The Banks of Allan Water, or the Death of Fair Eleanor (1831), performed at the Pavilion Theatre at Mile End; and a drama based on the Rothschilds - The Rise of the Rothschildes: Or, The Honest Jew of Frankfort (1838).  Other dramas from the pen of Barnett included The Drum of Fate or Sarah the Jewess (1838); The Minister's Dream or the Jew of Plymouth (1838); Linda; The Pearl of Savoy, adaptation of Rossi's libretto Linda di Chamounix; Victorine of Paris; Dominique, and Bohemians of Paris.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Barnett", "response": ["In 1834 he published a collection of Lyrical Illustrations of the Modern Poets. His opera The Mountain Sylph \u2013 with which his name is nowadays most associated \u2013 received a warm welcome when produced at the Lyceum on 25 August 1834, as the first modern English opera, and was given over 100 performances, which was an unusual success.  It was followed by Fair Rosamond in 1837, and Farinelli in 1839, to librettos by his younger brother Charles Zachary Barnett, but Barnett never again achieved the success that he had enjoyed with The Mountain Sylph.  Disappointed with his reception as a composer, Barnett retired to the country. He had a large connection as a singing-master at Cheltenham, and published Systems and Singing-masters (1842) and School for the Voice (1844). Barnett wrote several songs for the theatre with the actor, playwright and theatre manager John Baldwin Buckstone, and also some instrumental works, including three string quartets and a violin sonata."]}, {"page": "Oliver Twist", "response": ["*In 1838 Charles Zachary Barnett's adaptation, the three-act burletta Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress opened at the Marylebone Theatre in London .Theatres in Victorian London - Victorian Web"]}, {"page": "Adaptations of A Christmas Carol", "response": ["An early theatrical production was A Christmas Carol: Or, the Miser's Warning!, a two-act adaptation of A Christmas Carol by C.
