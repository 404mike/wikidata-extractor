The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico.\" Lucas later noted that Leia's mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, wears a similar-looking Hopi hairstyle in Revenge of the Sith. A photo depicting famous Mexican revolutionary Clara de la Rocha wearing a similar hairstyle exists in the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art archives. In 2015, Mental Floss cited research suggesting that while female Mexican revolutionaries did not have such elaborate hairstyles, young marriageable Hopi women did, and their \"squash blossom whorls\" superficially resemble Leia's hair buns. Leia's hairstyle may have also been inspired by that of Queen Fria in the 1939 Flash Gordon comic strip \"The Ice Kingdom of Mongo\", and scientist Barnes Wallis' wife Molly (played by Ursula Jeans) in the 1955 war film The Dam Busters.
