John Diamond wrote that \"there is really no such thing as alternative medicine, just medicine that works and medicine that doesn't\", a notion later echoed by Paul Offit: \"The truth is there's no such thing as conventional or alternative or complementary or integrative or holistic medicine. There's only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't. And the best way to sort it out is by carefully evaluating scientific studies\u2014not by visiting Internet chat rooms, reading magazine articles, or talking to friends.\" Comedian Tim Minchin has also taken to the issue in his viral animation short Storm: \"By definition alternative medicine has either not been proved to work, or been proved not to work.

Medicine.\""]}, {"page": "Richard Dawkins", "response": ["In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book Unweaving the Rainbow considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do \"myths\" and \"pseudoscience\". For John Diamond's posthumously published Snake Oil, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes. Dawkins states that \"There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work.\" In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film The Enemies of Reason, Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by \"an epidemic of superstitious thinking\"."]}, {"page": "Stoke Newington", "response": ["* John Diamond (1953\u20132001), journalist and radio presenter\u2014born in Stoke Newington."]}, {"page": "Nigella Lawson", "response": ["Lawson met journalist John Diamond in 1986, when they were both writing for The Sunday Times.
