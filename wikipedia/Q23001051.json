WikiLeaks reported a source within the Ecuadorian government saying that, due to the controversy, an agreement had been reached to expel Assange from the embassy and place him in the custody of UK police. According to Assange's father, the revoking of Assange's asylum was connected to an upcoming decision by the International Monetary Fund to grant Ecuador a loan, an assertion also made by critics of Moreno, such as former Ecuadorian foreign minister Guillaume Long."]}, {"page": "List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador", "response": ["*2016\u20132017: Guillaume Long"]}, {"page": "List of foreign ministers in 2016", "response": ["*#Guillaume Long (2016\u20132017)"]}, {"page": "General debate of the seventy-first session of the United Nations General Assembly", "response": ["* - Foreign Minister Guillaume Long"]}, {"page": "List of foreign ministers in 2017", "response": ["*# Guillaume Long (2016\u20132017)"]}, {"page": "List of permanent representatives of Ecuador to the United Nations Office at Geneva", "response": ["*: Guillaume LongUnited Nations Office at Geneva."]}, {"page": "Endorsements in the 2019 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["* Guillaume Long, Ecuadorian politician and academic"]}, {"page": "Andr\u00e9s Arauz", "response": ["Andr\u00e9s Arauz started his career as a public servant in 2009 at the Central Bank of Ecuador.
