His actual name was Iain Macrae, but he called himself Josh after the blues musician Josh White.He completed his National Service in the Army and during that time recorded \"The Talking Army Blues\". Whilst in the army he met Tony Hatch who wrote \"Messing About on the River\" (under the pseudonym Mark Anthony), which MacRae later recorded.He was signed to Pye Records in 1960, and three of his singles reached a peak of no. 15 on the Record Mirror chart; \"Talking Army Blues\" in July 1960, \"Wild Side of Life\" in December 1960 and \"Messing About on the River\" in February 1961.MacRae committed suicide in 1977.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tony Hatch", "response": ["On his return in 1959, Hatch began producing Top Rank artists such as Bert Weedon, the then unknown Adam Faith (\"Ah, Poor Little Baby\"), Josh MacRae (together with MacRae's early recordings with Scottish folk trio The Reivers), Jackie Dennis, Carry On comedy actor Kenneth Connor, and The Knightsbridge Strings, and started his own recording career with a cover version of Russ Conway's piano instrumental \"Side Saddle\".  Though he used his real name Tony Hatch as a performer and producer, through about 1964 virtually all his compositions were credited to Mark Anthony.", "As Mark Anthony, Hatch continued to write songs for Pye artists, including \"Messing About on the River\" for Josh MacRae. In 1963, Philadelphia teen idol Bobby Rydell hit the charts with \"Forget Him\" written and produced by Hatch (still writing as Mark Anthony); Hatch produced, arranged and wrote for other American stars such as Chubby Checker, Connie Francis, Pat Boone, Big Dee Irwin and Keely Smith. In 1964 he wrote (under the pseudonym of Fred Nightingale) the Searchers' hit \"Sugar and Spice\". By mid-1964, Hatch finally began using his own name as a composer regularly, with Tony Hatch being the credited composer of many of Petula Clark's biggest mid-1960s hits, including \"Downtown\", \"I Know a Place\", and \"Sign of the Times\", among others."]}]}}
