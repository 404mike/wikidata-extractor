He made his senior debut for Everton in 2001, and went on to make 328 appearances for the club in all competitions. With Hibbert being a one-club man for most of his career, coupled with his down-to-earth demeanour, he earned a cult hero status among Everton fans.

The first meeting of the sides that season saw one of most controversial derbies in recent memory, with Everton finishing an ill-tempered game with 9 men. Everton took a first half lead as Sami Hyypia skewed a left footed clearance into his own goal from a corner. The scoreline was levelled by Dirk Kuyt from the penalty spot after Everton's Tony Hibbert fouled Steven Gerrard in the area. Referee Mark Clattenburg earned the ire of the Goodison faithful as Steven Gerrard appeared to persuade him to change his mind in favour of a red card after first brandishing a yellow. Kuyt was fortunate to escape with a yellow card following a two-footed, aerial lunge on Phil Neville. Liverpool's pressure against the 10 men eventually told, as Liverpool were awarded a second penalty when Neville handled a goal bound shot from derby debutante Lucas Leiva. Neville was dismissed and Everton finished the game two players short. Kuyt scored his second goal of the game from the spot as Liverpool won the game 2\u20131. The victory helped secure a top-four finish and Champions League qualification for Liverpool, leaving Everton to settle for a UEFA Cup place. Referee Clattenburg was not chosen to officiate again at Goodison Park after that match until December 2013, six years later, and in that period only officiated one Everton game, away at Aston Villa."]}, {"page": "List of Everton F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:right;\"|4||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Tony Hibbert || 24 || 2000\u20132016"]}, {"page": "Hibbert", "response": ["* Tony Hibbert (British Army officer) (1917-2014), British soldier and gardener", "* Tony Hibbert (musician) (born 1956), English musician (bass guitarist)", "* Tony Hibbert (born 1981), English football defender"]}, {"page": "Franco Di Santo", "response": ["On the opening day of the following Premier League season, Di Santo won a penalty from Ritchie De Laet, which teammate Ben Watson converted in the 1\u20131 draw against Norwich City.
