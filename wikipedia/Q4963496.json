Mathews wanted to cast comedian Dermot Morgan from an early stage, but Linehan was reluctant; he worried that audiences would confuse Ted with Father Trendy, a character Morgan had previously created for The Live Mike. Trendy parodied a class of priests including Brian D'Arcy, perceived in the 1970s as wanting to be considered liberal and \"cool\", whereas Ted was written as a more conservative, traditional priest. Morgan lobbied hard for the role, eventually persuading Linehan. The writers considered O'Donoghue a back-up to use should Morgan become unavailable, and later created Father Dick Byrne, Ted's recurring rival, specifically for O'Donoghue to play."]}, {"page": "Terry Wogan", "response": ["Wogan's health declined after Christmas 2015.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said that \"Britain has lost a huge talent\" and President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins praised Wogan's career and his frequent visits to his homeland.  Taoiseach Enda Kenny and T\u00e1naiste Joan Burton remembered Wogan for his role in helping Anglo-Irish relations during the Troubles.

Between 1979 and 1982 Morgan played a range of comic characters who appeared between segments of the show. Morgan lampooned the rampant Modernism within the Post-Vatican II Roman Catholic Church in Ireland by creating Father Trendy, a wishy-washy, trying-to-be-cool hippie-priest (modelled after Father Brian D'Arcy). Father Trendy always wore an Elvis-style haircut and, sometimes, a leather jacket. He was also given to drawing ludicrous parallels between religious life and secular hobbies in two-minute 'sermons' to the camera. Morgan's other characters included a bigoted GAA member who waved his hurley around while verbally attacking his pet hates."]}, {"page": "Modernism in the Catholic Church", "response": ["* Irish comedian Dermot Morgan lampooned the alleged Modernism of the Post-Vatican II Catholic Church in Ireland while appearing on the RT\u00c9 television show The Live Mike between 1979 and 1982.

From September 1990, the format changed so that the show was presented by a regular presenter from the studio, with recordings of hymns, some sung by a \"featured choir\", inserted between the discussion, prayers and dedications. Each week the show is centred on a specific theme: an event in the Church calendar, a passage of the Bible, or a more general area such as the family or the importance of carers. The longest-serving of the regular presenters was Roger Royle, an Anglican priest, who presented the show between September 1990 and April 2007. Brian D'Arcy, a Passionist priest from Northern Ireland, took over as the presenter in April 2007. Diane-Louise Jordan was the next presenter, replacing Father Brian in February 2012.
