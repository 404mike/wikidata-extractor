The presiding magistrate, Sir Chartres Biron, holds that the book contains \"not one word which suggested that anyone with the horrible tendencies described was in the least degree blameworthy. All the characters in the book were presented as attractive people and put forward with admiration.\" Other lesbian literature published in England this year evades prosecution: Elizabeth Bowen's novel The Hotel, Virginia Woolf's fictional Orlando: A Biography, and Compton MacKenzie's satirical Extraordinary Women.

Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women.\" Woolf references the obscenity trial and public uproar resulting from the publishing of Radclyffe Hall's lesbian-themed novel The Well of Loneliness (1928). Before she can discuss Chloe liking Olivia, the narrator has to be assured that Sir Chartres Biron, the magistrate of Hall's obscenity trial, is not in the audience: \"Are there no men present? Do you promise the figure of Sir Chartres Biron is not concealed? We are all women, you assure me? Then I may tell you\u00a0...\""]}, {"page": "Patrick Hastings", "response": ["Hastings approached Gill and asked him for a place in his chambers. Gill's chambers were full but he did suggest a well-respected barrister named F.\u00a0E. Smith, and Hastings went to see him with a letter of recommendation from Gill. Smith was out and Hastings instead spoke to his clerk; the two did not get on, and Hastings left without securing a place. Hastings later described this as \"the most fortunate moment of my whole career\".Hastings (1950) p. 94 Directly below Smith's chambers were those of Horace Avory, one of the most noted barristers of the 19th and early 20th centuries.Hyde (1960) p. 28 As he prepared to return home, Hastings was informed that Chartres Biron (one of the barristers who occupied Avory's chambers) had been appointed a Metropolitan Magistrate, which freed up a space in the chambers. He immediately went to Avory's clerk and got him to introduce Hastings to Avory. Avory initially refused to give Hastings a place in the chambers, but after Hastings lost his temper and exclaimed that \"if he didn't want me to help him it would leave me more time to myself\", Avory laughed and changed his mind."]}, {"page": "The Well of Loneliness", "response": ["Shortly after the book's publication, it had become the target of a campaign by James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express. Douglas wrote that \"I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel.\" A British court judged it obscene because it defended \"unnatural practices between women\";Quotation from Hall, 313. For accounts of the British trial and the events leading up to it, see Souhami, 192\u2013241, and Cline, 225\u2013267. For a detailed examination of controversies over The Well of Loneliness in the 1920s, see chapter 1 of Doan, Fashioning Sapphism. An overview can be found in the introduction to Doan & Prosser, Palatable Poison, which also reprints the full text of several contemporary reviews and reactions, including the Sunday Express editorial and Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron's legal judgement. In England, it would not be published again for another three decades, in 1959. In the United States, the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court.A detailed discussion of the US trials can be found in Taylor, \"I Made Up My Mind\".", "After Stephen reads Krafft-Ebing in her father's library, she opens the Bible at random, seeking a sign, and reads Genesis 4:15, \"And the Lord set a mark upon Cain\u00a0...\"Hall, 205. Hall uses the mark of Cain, a sign of shame and exile, throughout the novel as a metaphor for the situation of inverts.Medd, 242. Her defence of inversion took the form of a religious argument: God had created inverts, so humanity should accept them.Souhami, 167\u2013168; Munt, 213; Stimpson, 368. The Well's use of religious imagery outraged the book's opponents,In his decision condemning the book, Sir Chartres Biron called the references to God \"singularly inappropriate and disgusting\". Biron, 48. but Hall's vision of inversion as a God-given state was an influential contribution to the language of LGBT rights.Munt, 213.", "The obscenity trial began on 9 November 1928.Miller, pp. 187\u201388 Cape's solicitor Harold Rubinstein sent out 160 letters to potential witnesses. Many were reluctant to appear in court; according to Virginia Woolf, \"they generally put it down to the weak heart of a father, or a cousin who is about to have twins\".Souhami, 211. About 40 turned up on the day of the trial, including Woolf herself, Forster, and such diverse figures as biologist Julian Huxley, Laurence Housman of the British Sexological Society, Robert Cust JP of the London Morality Council, Charles Ricketts of the Royal Academy of Art and Rabbi Joseph Frederick Stern of the East London Synagogue. Norman Haire, who was the star witness after Havelock Ellis bowed out, declared that homosexuality ran in families and a person could no more become it by reading books than if he could become syphilitic by reading about syphilis.Souhami, 197. None were allowed to offer their views of the novel. Under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron could decide whether the book was obscene without hearing any testimony on the question.Cline, 256\u2013258. \"I don't think people are entitled to express an opinion upon a matter which is the decision of the court,\" he said.Souhami, 225. Since Hall herself was not on trial, she did not have the right to her own counsel, and Cape's barrister Norman Birkett had persuaded her not to give evidence herself."]}, {"page": "Joseph Hudson (tobacconist)", "response": ["*Chartres Biron (a descendant)"]}, {"page": "Sir Chartres Biron", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chartres Biron"]}]}}
