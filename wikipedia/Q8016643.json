He made 7 known appearances in first-class matches.  He was the younger brother of Thomas Pattenden.\nHe played alongside his brother in a number of Kent teams from 1777 to 1781.  He may have played for Kent v Surrey in 1773 for in one account the Pattenden was William and in another it was Thomas.  This is a good example of the confusion caused when initials or first names are left out of the scorecards.  The same applies to various Woods, Mays, Rimmingtons, Whites, etc.", "link_mentions": {}}}
