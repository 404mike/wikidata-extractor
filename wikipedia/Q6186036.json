He was the creator, presenter and producer of Yorkshire Television\u2019s religious programme Stars on Sunday.\nHe was born in Tyldesley, Lancashire. His family moved to Llandudno when he was five. After leaving school, Yates worked as a cinema organist. He was born into a show business family; his mother booked stage acts. After the war he worked for BBC Television as a freelance designer and joined the BBC on the production side in 1949. He was involved with programmes such as Come Dancing, The Good Old Days and the Miss World competition.\nIn 1968, he became Head of Children's programmes for Yorkshire Television. The following year, he began hosting Stars on Sunday. Yates introduced the show seated at an electric organ, placed in front of a stained-glass window. One of his many observations was, \"We can't see round the bend in the road, but God can.\" The programme attracted many special guests, including Harry Secombe, Dame Anna Neagle, and Gracie Fields. He was quoted as wanting stars to appear on the programme as that is what he thought would persuade viewers to tune in.\nFrom 1958 to 1975, Yates was married to actress and author Elaine Smith (whose stage name was Heller Toren, and who later wrote under the pseudonym Helene Thornton), and had a daughter Paula, born in 1959. His TV presenting career ended in 1974 when it was publicly revealed that he had been having an affair with young actress Anita Kay, although he was separated from his wife at the time. Amid the ensuing furor, Yates had to be smuggled from Yorkshire Television's studio complex in Leeds in the boot of a car.\nJess Yates died of a stroke in April 1993, aged 74. In December 1997, a DNA test revealed that Paula Yates' biological father was not Jess Yates, but the television presenter Hughie Green, a one time friend of Jess Yates who became his long-term arch enemy from the 1960s onwards. Green was a key man in exposing Jess Yates's affair with Anita Kay back in 1974.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jess", "response": ["* Jess Yates (1918\u20131993), British television presenter"]}, {"page": "Paula Yates", "response": ["Born on 24 April 1959\"Paula Yates\" .

Jess Yates was 19 years older than his wife, and their marriage was unconventional.", "In December 1997, a few weeks after Hutchence's death and while Yates was fighting for custody of Tiger, Yates suffered another blow when a DNA test result confirmed tabloid media reports that Jess Yates, who had died in April 1993, was not Yates's biological father.

Green grew frustrated by Yorkshire Television's failure to remove programme producer Jess Yates when he requested this to be done and so leaked to Botham the stories of Yates' affair with the young actress Anita Kay, whose story, published in the News of the World, destroyed Yates' career. In May 1997, shortly after Green's death, Botham wrote the expos\u00e9 story, also in the News of the World, of Green being the biological father of Jess Yates' daughter, TV presenter Paula Yates, something she read when the tabloids printed the story, and which was later confirmed with a DNA test result in December 1997. Through his daughter Linda, Green had four granddaughters, Delia, Christina, Stephanie and Marina. Through his daughter Paula, Green had four other granddaughters whom he never knew: Fifi, Peaches and Pixie Geldof, fathered by Bob Geldof, and Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence, fathered by Michael Hutchence.

However, religious television is dominated by the main non-commercial terrestrial public service broadcaster, the BBC, obliged by its licence to broadcast 110 hours per year. Long-running programmes such as Songs of Praise continue to draw loyal audiences, although declining interest in devotional-style religious programmes\u2014and sometimes erratic scheduling decisions\u2014have taken their toll. Up until the turn of the century, the ITV channels and Channel 4 also produced religious programme content, and for many years Sunday evenings were dominated by 'the God slot'\u2014a 70-minute diet of back-to-back religious programmes broadcast simultaneously on BBC 1 and ITV.  Attempts to extend the range of formats and experiment in more populist styles, reached its zenith in the late 1960s with the light entertainment show, Stars on Sunday (Yorkshire Television, 1969\u201379) on ITV, reaching audiences of 15 million. \u00a0The show was conceived and presented by Yorkshire Television's Head of Children's Programmes, Jess Yates and ran for a decade. Serious documentary-style religious content emerged in the 1970s, with the BBC's Everyman, and ITV's Credo programme series'.  Religious broadcasting began to go into decline in the later 1970s and 1980s.  The birth of the fourth public service channel in 1982 with a remit to cater for minority interests, raised great expectations followed by enormous disappointment among many who believed that Channel 4 would provide exciting now opportunities for religious broadcasting. Channel 4's first major religious programme commission caused a furore:  Jesus: The Evidence (London Weekend Television for Channel 4), broadcast over the Easter period in 1984, proved to be a pivotal moment in the disintegrating relationship between the broadcasting institutions and the churches."]}, {"page": "Mark Curry (television presenter)", "response": ["Born in Stafford, Curry grew up in the mining village of Allerton Bywater near Castleford in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
