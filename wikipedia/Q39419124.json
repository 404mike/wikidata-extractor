She went on to take up a position at the University's Computer Science Department which had been recently established by Professor Sidney Michaelson FRSE, who wanted her to teach first-year students how to program. Initially there were no other permanent women lecturers. Candlin moved on to teach more advanced students, designed courses on real-time programming, and also on parallel programming which became her speciality."]}, {"page": "Sid Michaelson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sidney Michaelson"]}]}}
