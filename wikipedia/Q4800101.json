Stoke had just finished bottom of the Football League for the second time and failed to be re-elected, instead joining the Football Alliance. Whilst Stoke had struggled to compete in the League they found the Alliance easy ending the 1890\u201391 season as champions with just two defeats and re-claimed their place in the Football League. But halfway through the 1891\u201392 campaign with the team struggling, he left his position to be replaced by Arthur Reeves."]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["For the 1891\u201392 season the Football League was increased from 12 to 14 clubs, Stoke along with Darwen joined the Football League. Despite a bright enough start, Stoke winning 2\u20131 at home to Derby County, there was a lack of improvement in their overall form and the team quickly dropped down the table. A 9\u20133 defeat at Darwen, who eventually finished bottom of the league and failed to be re-elected, was the most disappointing performance of a dismal campaign, although Stoke did win 5\u20131 in the return fixture. Goalkeeper Bill Rowley had now returned from injury and was captain of the side, while Arthur Reeves replaced Joseph Bradshaw as manager in January 1892. Re-election was again sought and duly achieved beating Sheffield United by one vote. They instead joined the newly formed Second Division for the 1892\u201393 season. Left-winger Joe Schofield made his debut for Stoke against Burnley on 10 October 1891. Schofield would go on to become one of Stoke's greatest players of the 1890s and earned a reputation as a goalscoring winger and he later managed the club during World War I."]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["In 1892\u201393 Stoke finally made an impression in the Football League and claimed seventh place in the table. They collected 29 points, 11 more than bottom club Newton Heath, but were 19 points behind champions Sunderland. Ted Evans became the first Stoke player to be sent-off in the league when he received his marching orders in an away match at Everton on 12 November 1892, Stoke held out for a 2\u20132 draw. Throughout the season manager Arthur Reeves was able to field a settled side which included successful Scottish imports Davy Christie, Davy Brodie, Billy Dickson, Willie Naughton and Jimmie Robertson. Stoke went on an eight match unbeaten run through October and November and back to back home 7\u20131 and 6\u20130 victories over Newton Heath and Bolton Wanderers respectively the best results in an encouraging campaign for the \"Potters\"."]}]}}
