In 1846, he proposed that the distributions of montane plants and animals had been compressed downslope, and some oceanic islands connected to the mainland, during the recent ice age. This mechanism, which was the first natural explanation to explain the distributions of the same species on now-isolated islands and mountain tops, was discovered independently by Charles Darwin, who credited Forbes with the idea. He also incorrectly deduced the so-called azoic hypothesis, that life under the sea would decline to the point that no life forms could exist below a certain depth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marine biology", "response": ["The study of marine biology dates back to Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC), who made many observations of life in the sea around Lesbos, laying the foundation for many future discoveries.\"History of the Study of Marine Biology - MarineBio.org\".
