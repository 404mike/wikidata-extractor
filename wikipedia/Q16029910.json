The party lost 13 seats at the 1898 election, including ministers Jacob Garrard, Albert Gould and Sydney Smith, mostly to the Protectionist Party which contested the election under the name \"National Federal Party\", reflecting the party's focus on Federation. The ministry's first re-shuffle occurred in August 1898 as a result of that election, with James Hogue, Charles Lee and Varney Parkes appointed to the ministry. Glebe (James Hogue) was the only electorate in which the by-election was contested. Jack Want resigned as Attorney General in April 1898 as a result of Reid's famous Yes-No speech in order to oppose federation, rejoining in June 1898 after the first referendum was defeated. Want resigned again in April 1899 and Reid was appointed Attorney General, initially in addition to his role as Colonial Treasurer, before relinquishing that role in the second re-shuffle in July 1899. The Reid ministry managed to hold on as a minority government until 13 September 1899, when Reid resigned in order to focus on ensuring adequate provisions were made for New South Wales in the federation of the Australian colonies into a Commonwealth."]}, {"page": "Minister for Planning and Public Spaces", "response": ["| Jacob Garrard"]}, {"page": "1898 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["\t| Jacob Garrard"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1898 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Sherbrooke || Free Trade || |Broughton O'Conor || Jacob Garrard || || James Purser (Ind)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1895 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Sherbrooke || Free Trade || || |Jacob Garrard || || Broughton O'Conor (Ind)  Thomas Pye (Ind Prot)  George Stimson (Ind Prot)  Edward Wakely (Ind FT)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1894 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Sherbrooke || Ambrose Hallen || |Jacob Garrard || James Williamson || William Bladon (Ind FT)  Samuel Bursill (Ind FT)  Donald Campbell (Ind FT)  John Fitzpatrick (Ind FT)  Henry Pigott (Ind FT)  James Tamsett (Ind Prot)  Edward Wakely (Ind FT)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1891 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Balmain || 4 Free Trade || William Burns  Samuel Davison  Solomon Hyam  Angus Mackey || George Clubb  Jacob Garrard  John Hawthorne  Frank Smith || |George Clark*  Edward Darnley*  James Johnston*  William Murphy* || Robert Cropley (Ind FT)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1889 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Balmain || 3 Free Trade  1 New || David Buchanan  William Hutchinson  Solomon Hyam  William Inglis || |George Clubb*  Jacob Garrard*  John Hawthorne*  Frank Smith* "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1887 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Balmain || Thomas Belgrave  Solomon Hyam  Aaron Wheeler || |Jacob Garrard*  John Hawthorne*  Frank Smith* || "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1885 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Balmain || |Jacob Garrard  John Hawthorne  Solomon Hyam || Edward Buchanan  Samuel Davison  Maurice Fitzharding"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1882 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Balmain || |Jacob Garrard  William Hutchinson || William Pritchard  John Taylor"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1880 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Balmain || |Jacob Garrard || Albert Elkington  Charles Mossman  John Taylor"]}]}}
