In the film, the senior  British officer was portrayed as working with the Japanese. This was regarded by many former prisoners of war as a gross travesty of the truth. Toosey initially refused repeated requests by the veterans to speak out against the film, being much too modest to seek any glory or recognition for himself.  Eventually he was persuaded to write a letter to the Daily Telegraph, which caused several other veterans to emphasise the injustice that had occurred.  Nevertheless, the film was highly successful and so formed the public perception of events at Tamarkan.  As a result, Toosey agreed several years later to be interviewed by Professor Peter Davies, providing 48 hours of taped interviews on the understanding that they were not to be published until after Toosey's death.  Eventually Davies documented Toosey's achievements in a 1991 book entitled The Man Behind the Bridge () and a BBC Timewatch programme.  A book by his oldest granddaughter, Julie Summers, The Colonel of Tamarkan, was published in 2005 ().", "* The Colonel of Tamarkan.
