Past professors include Christopher Wren (1661\u201373), architect of St Paul's Cathedral in London and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford; he held the professorship at the time of his commission to rebuild the cathedral after it was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666.  Three professors have been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society: Charles Pritchard (1870\u201393), Harry Plaskett (1932\u201360) and Joseph Silk (1999\u20132012). The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford, since the late 19th century. In the past, some of the professors were provided with an official residence, either near New College or at the Radcliffe Observatory, although this practice ended in the 19th century. The astronomy professor is a member of the Sub-Department of Astrophysics at Oxford.", "The second official residence was built during the time of Thomas Hornsby (astronomy professor 1763\u20131810), who proposed that an observatory should be built at a site to the north of the city centre. In 1772, construction began of the Radcliffe Observatory and an adjoining house for the astronomy professor, to which Hornsby moved. Thereafter the university sub-let his former residence.  Both of his successors, Abraham Robertson (1810\u201327) and Stephen Rigaud (1827\u201339), were the geometry professor at their appointment to the astronomy chair, and in turn they moved from New College Lane to the Radcliffe Observatory. The university then sub-let the astronomy professor's house. The link between the professorship and the observatory was broken in 1839 with the appointment of George Johnson; he had little practical astronomical experience and the officers in charge of the observatory appointed Manuel Johnson as Radcliffe Observer instead. In the early 19th century, New College decided that it wished to use the properties for itself and the lease expired without renewal in 1854. Charles Pritchard (1870\u201393) had a new observatory built in the University Parks, but his attempts to persuade the university to add a residence for the Savilian professor were unsuccessful."]}, {"page": "Frere Hall", "response": ["Frere Hall houses a number of stone busts, including that of King Edward VII, which was a gift from local Parsi philanthropist Seth Edulji Dinshaw.
