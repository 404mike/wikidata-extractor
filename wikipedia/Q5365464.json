This was despite of the sale of leading goalscorer Elliot Benyon to Swindon and the fact that the Gulls were docked one point by the Football League for fielding loan signing Jake Robinson while still ineligible to play.  Torquay saw off their semi-final opponents Shrewsbury Town with relative ease to set up a League Two play-off final clash with Stevenage.  However, the Gulls' season was ultimately to end in disappointment with a 1\u20130 defeat in the final and the departure of manager Paul Buckle for Bristol Rovers just two days afterwards.", "In recognition of Torquay's impressive start to the season, Paul Buckle was named League Two Manager of the Month for August.  However, after a near perfect August, September was to prove something of a reality check for the Gulls.  With Torquay's clean sheet record ending against Port Vale in their previous match, a 2\u20131 defeat away to Southend in their first game of the month put to an end a twelve match unbeaten run in the League which had stretched back to March.  This was then followed up by two successive 0\u20130 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage.  Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net.  With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were starting to look a little light up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.", "No new additions were made to the squad during the month, although the loan deal for Joe Oastler was extended until January while Wolves agreed to allow Ashley Hemmings to extend his stay at Plainmoor.  With the loan window about to close, leading striker Elliot Benyon appeared to be on the verge of leaving Torquay, with Swindon, Dagenham & Redbridge and Southend among the clubs reported to have been interested in making a move for the young forward.  However, Gulls fans were relieved when the window closed with Benyon still part of the United squad - at least until the January transfer window.  Of the two players placed on the transfer list in October, Kieran Charnock moved on loan to Morecambe, with a view to making the deal a permanent one in January. However, former captain Nicky Wroe now seemed happy to remain at Plainmoor after Paul Buckle revealed the midfielder had rejected a move to Aldershot.", "Just two days after the huge disappointment of the Crawley game, the last day of the January transfer window finally saw the departure of top striker Elliot Benyon to Swindon.  Benyon had been one of Paul Buckle's first signings when he took over at Plainmoor in 2007, and had now developed into Torquay's main goal threat.  As such he had been tracked by several clubs over a number of months and his eventual move had been seen as inevitable by the majority of Gulls fans.  The last day of the window also saw the transfer of Nicky Wroe to Shrewsbury and the cancellation of Ashley Hemmings\u2019 loan deal with Wolves.  In their place came striker Jake Robinson and midfielder Craig Stanley on loan deals from Shrewsbury and Morecambe respectively.
