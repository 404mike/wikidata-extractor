If one rules out the inscriptions on stone or metal, which belong to the science of epigraphy, we are practically dependent for the period preceding the 4th or 5th century AD on the papyri from Egypt (cf. papyrology), the earliest of which take back our knowledge only to the end of the 4th century BC. This limitation is less serious than might appear, since the few manuscripts not of Egyptian origin which have survived from this period, like the parchments from AvromanCf. E. H. Minns, Journ. of Hell. Stud., xxxv, pp.22ff. or Dura,Cf. New Pal. Soc., ii, p. 156. the Herculaneum papyri, and a few documents found in Egypt but written elsewhere, reveal a uniformity of style in the various portions of the Greek world; but some differences can be discerned, and it is probable that, were there more material, distinct local styles could be traced.In creating and expanding the following sections on \u2014inclusive of the \"Vellum and Paper Manuscripts\" subsection\u2014specialist sources have been consulted and thoroughly perused for the relevant text and citations, as follows: primarily the article on general palaeography by renowned British papyrologist and scholar Sir Harold Idris Bell, present in  ; Barry B.

Edward Maunde Thompson, Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography, s.v.; Van Hoesen, The Parentage and Birthdate of the Latin Uncial, in Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, xlii. the two hands are nevertheless quite distinct. The uncial is a libraria, closely related to the capital writing, from which it differs only in the rounding off of the angles of certain letters, principally 28px 15px 15px 30px. It represents a compromise between the beauty and legibility of the capitals and the rapidity of the cursive, and is clearly an artificial product. It was certainly in existence by the latter part of the 4th century, for a number of manuscripts of that date are written in perfect uncial hands (Exempla, pl. XX). It presently supplanted the capitals and appears in numerous manuscripts which have survived from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, when it was at its height.A list is given in Traube, Vorlesungen, i, pp. 171\u2013261, and numerous reproductions in Zangemeister & Wattenbach's Exempla, and in Chatelain, Uncialis scriptura. By this time it had become an imitative hand, in which there was generally no room for spontaneous development. It remained noticeably uniform over a long period. It is difficult therefore to date the manuscripts by palaeographical criteria alone. The most that can be done is to classify them by centuries, on the strength of tenuous data.Cf. Chatelain, Unc. script., explanatio tabularum. The earliest uncial writing is easily distinguished by its simple and monumental character from the later hands, which become progressively stiff and affected."]}, {"page": "Robert the Bruce", "response": ["* Geoffrey the Baker's: Chronicon Galfridi le Baker de Swynebroke, ed.

In 1916, the paleographer Sir Edward Maunde Thompson published a minute analysis of the handwriting of the addition and judged it to be Shakespeare's. The case was strengthened with the publication of Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More (1923) Greg, W.W. editor. Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Cambridge University Press, 2010. . by five noted scholars who analysed the play from multiple perspectives, all of which led to the same affirmative conclusion. A second significant gathering of scholars to consider Sir Thomas More grew out of a seminar that was held during the meeting of the Shakespeare Association of America at Ashland, Oregon in 1983.  It resulted in a second book of essays, eight by eight different authors, that was published as Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; Essays on the Play and its Shakespearean Interest.  It is a comprehensive study of the manuscript, and states that it appears more likely than ever that Shakespeare did indeed contribute to the revision of this play.Howard-Hill, T.H. editor. Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest. Cambridge University Press. (1989)  . This would make it the only surviving manuscript text written by Shakespeare. Although some dissenters remain, the attribution has been generally accepted since the mid-20th century and most authoritative editions of Shakespeare's works, including The Oxford Shakespeare, include the play. It was performed with Shakespeare's name included amongst the authors by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005. The issue was supported and disputed over a long period on the evidence of literary style and Shakespeare's distinctive handwriting. The lines in Hand D \"are now generally accepted as the work of Shakespeare.\";  If the Shakespearean identification is correct, these three pages represent the only surviving examples of Shakespeare's handwriting, aside from a few signatures on documents. The manuscript, with its numerous corrections, deletions and insertions, enables us to glimpse Shakespeare in the process of composition.."]}, {"page": "Ray Lankester", "response": ["There was trouble from the moment Lankester put forward his candidature for the office vacated by Sir William Flower, who was on the point of death.
