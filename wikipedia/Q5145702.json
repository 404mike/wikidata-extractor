Saxophonist Mike Elliott also left around this time and was never replaced. Curtis hung around and helped them audition a replacement singer. They auditioned 200 singers. It was reported in a NME article in 1968 that Curtis while being interviewed at a festival had mentioned that they were trying out Warren Davis to replace him. He said he would not leave the band until they found a replacement. He had become friendly with Sammy Davis Jr. and was encouraged to try his luck in the United States. He moved to the United States for a solo career on the club circuit, encouraged by the likes of Wilson Pickett and Sam & Dave, playing Las Vegas with The Righteous Brothers. His successful replacement was Colin Young.", "In the mid-1970s, while Clem Curtis and the Foundations were on the road, there was also another Foundations line-up that was led by Colin Young who were touring at the same time, and were playing basically the same material. This eventually led to court action which resulted in Curtis being allowed to bill his group as either the Foundations or Clem Curtis & the Foundations. Young was allowed to bill himself as \"The New Foundations\", or as \"Colin Young & the New Foundations\".", "* Colin Young: lead vocals - b. 12 September 1944, Barbados, West Indies - replaced Clem Curtis in 1968.", "From the band's beginning to their breakup towards the end of 1970, the Foundations released ten singles in the United Kingdom including two versions of the same song. The majority of the singles were composed by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. They had four significant hits from these plus a minor hit with one of their own compositions, \"Born to Live, Born to Die\". They had minor hit with \"My Little Chickadee\" in the United States. This was written by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. There were other titles announced that were either never recorded or were never released. They were \"Our Love Went Thataway\", \"Tear Jerker, Music-worker, You\" which was to be released around the same time as \"Better By Far\" by Lulu and \"No Place On Earth Could Find You\". In 1971, the single \"Stoney Ground\" was released. It is believed that this single was actually by Colin Young and his new backing band Development. It seems quite likely as the Colin Young and Development debut single \"Any Time at All\" pre-dates \"Stoney Ground\". In the mid and late 1970s, there were two more singles released under the Foundations name. They were \"Where Were You When I Needed Your Love\" and \"Closer to Loving You\" which featured the Northern Soul classic \"Change My Life\" as the B side. These last two singles to bear the Foundations name featured Clem Curtis once more as the lead vocalist."]}, {"page": "Dominique de Menil", "response": ["After being met with increasing resistance by the more traditional Basilian clergy at the University of St. Thomas, in 1969 the de Menils moved the art department\u2014including the art history faculty\u2014and Media Center to Rice University, where they founded the Institute for the Arts to manage the exhibition program at Rice Museum.
