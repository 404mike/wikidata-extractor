His work is characterised by combining serious scholarship with an entertaining style. Something of a polymath, he has also written on subjects as diverse as computer simulation, mathematical problems, philosophy, etymology and comparative philology. For several years he wrote a weekly column on English word origins for the Sunday Express, a national newspaper in the UK.He has travelled extensively in Central Asia and Southern Asia, researching Zoroastrianism and other ancient religions. According to his publishers his book Beyond Belief took over 20 years of research, including an overland expedition from Europe to South and Central Asia, retracing the journeys of Alexander the Great, Robert Byron and Eric Newby. This research took him to sites including Medjugorje in Herzegovina; traditional Bogomil sites in the Balkans, early Christian sites across Turkey, the Mountains of Ararat near the border with Iran, Zoroastrian Towers of Silence, Chak Chak and other Zoroastrian centres in Iran, Christian churches in Pakistan, Parsee temples in Mumbi, the Syrian Churches of Kerala, the Roza Bal shrine at Srinagar in Kashmir; Lumbini in the Rupandehi district of Nepal; early Buddhist sites along the Karakorum Highway, and historic religious sites of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nHe was educated in the UK at University College, Oxford, and at Sussex and Nottingham Universities. He holds an MA in mathematics from Oxford University, an MSc in Operational Research from Sussex University and an MA in history and theology from the Nottingham University. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London in 1990. He is a life member of Humanists UK. His biography in the 5th edition of his book Voltaire on the Cathars notes that he is one of a small but growing number of atheist theologians.\nHe is the ch\u00e2telain of Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Ferriol, a late medieval - early Renaissance castle, in the village and commune of Saint-Ferriol, in the Aude d\u00e9partement in the South of France which is listed as a Monument Historique by the French Government.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Koch snowflake", "response": ["Squares can be used to generate similar fractal curves. Starting with a unit square and adding to each side at each iteration a square with dimension one third of the squares in the previous iteration, it can be shown that both the length of the perimeter and the total area are determined by geometric progressions. The progression for the area converges to 2 while the progression for the perimeter diverges to infinity, so as in the case of the Koch snowflake, we have a finite area bounded by an infinite fractal curve.Demonstrated by  James McDonald  in a public lecture at KAUST University on January 27, 2013.  retrieved 29 January 2013. The resulting area fills a square with the same center as the original, but twice the area, and rotated by  radians, the perimeter touching but never overlapping itself."]}, {"page": "John Leggott College", "response": ["* James McDonald, polymath (1970\u201372)"]}, {"page": "James McDonald", "response": ["James McDonald may refer to:", "* James McDonald (Irish politician), nationalist politician in Northern Ireland", "* James McDonald (Canadian politician) (1828\u20131912), Canadian lawyer, politician, and judge", "* James McDonald (New Zealand politician) (1837\u20131900), New Zealand politician", "* James McDonald (Victorian Nationalist politician) (1856\u20131933), Victorian state MP", "* James McDonald (Victorian Labor politician) (1889\u20131938), Victorian state MP", "* James McDonald (Tasmanian politician) (1877\u20131947), Australian Labor Party Member of the Tasmania House of Assembly", "* James McDonald (baseball) (born 1984), American baseball pitcher", "* James McDonald (Australian footballer) (born 1976), Australian rules footballer", "* James McDonald (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer", "* James McDonald (American football) (born 1961), American football player", "* James McDonald (jockey) (born 1992), New Zealand jockey", "* James McDonald (economist) (born c. 1942), economist at Brigham Young University", "* James McDonald (RAF officer) (1899\u2013?), World War I flying ace", "* James McDonald (writer) (born 1953), British writer", "* James McDonald (businessman) (1843\u20131915), English-American oil businessman", "* James McDonald (artist) (1865\u20131935), New Zealand artist and promoter of Maori arts and crafts", "* James McDonald (lawyer) (died 1831), first Native American who professionally studied law", "* F.
