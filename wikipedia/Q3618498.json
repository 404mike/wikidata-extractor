Wenig assigns Beg.N.28 to the 2nd century and suggests that Teqorideamani I reigned from about 90 until 114. The discovery in the tomb of an inscribed olive oil amphora from Tubusuctu is more consonant with a 3rd-century date.

Spread throughout West Africa, in Kano, Nigeria, they were grounded on the edges to make round beads fit together on a strand more suitably. There, they picked up the name \"Kano Beads\", although they were not originally produced in Kano. By the 1930s, their value had decreased; in 1937, A. J.

Extensive excavations were done at these sites by archaeologist A. J. Arkell in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Arkell, the undoubted origin of the black-topped motif in pottery is tied to gourd cups in Sudan which have a black rim, \"for when a gourd is cut in half to make two bowls, its rim is always fired, presumably in order to prevent it tasting or splintering.\" Arkell states that it was natural for potters to try to recreate the black rim because \"a gourd would not look right without a black rim.\" This theory argues that the black top was not immediately a matter of function, but an aesthetic choice influenced by a tradition that was created for the functionality of alternative materials.

Arkell was the first archaeologist to excavate the site (1949) with the intention of filling in the gaps that remain between northern and western Neolithic histories in Africa. He excavated hearths riddled with evidence of complex culture and various subsistence practices. After the occupation that left the hearths, during the early Neolithic, it became a burial ground for occupants during the Late Neolithic. Numerous other archaeologists have visited the site since and published findings on pottery, food production, and tool production."]}]}}
