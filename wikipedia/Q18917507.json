C. mukul: Bdellium has been seriously considered as the ancient onycha. The tree, which grows in Arabia, produces a gum that was used in antiquity as an incense. It was one of the substances used in incense in ancient Egypt. As an incense it produces a sweet, spicy smell that some consider similar, although less bitter than, myrrh, combined with the scent of mushroom. The gum was often used as an adulterant of myrrh in the spice trade. The gum rolled into a small ball is known as hadrabolon. It is dry and shining having numerous white spots, like finger-nails in shape.Natural History 12.19 Dioscorides said that bdellium was \"the tear of an Arabian tree.\"\"De Materia Medica,\" i. 80Jewish Encyclopedia,Morris Jastrow Jr. and Immanuel Benzinger He describes bdellium as resembling a fingernailDe materia medica, A, 67 (which is the Greek meaning of onycha).

It is, however, certain that in the Mughal period, most likely during the reign of either Emperor Akbar (1556\u20131605) or Emperor Jahangir (1605\u20131627), the figured or flowered muslin came to be known as the jamdani.

[which] ... stood the hot dry climate wonderfully well'.James Waterhouse, Thirty-seven years of photographic work in India, in Camera obscura: revue internationale pour la photographie paraissant touse les mois en 4 langues, Amsterdam, 1899-1901, vol. 1, no. 8 (1900), pp.594-95. For a complete transcript of Waterhouse's series of articles in this journal, see John Falconer et al, The Waterhouse Albums (Mapin Publishing, Ahmadabad, 2009). His first serious photographic expedition appears to have been made in 1861 in the company of a fellow officer, Boyce Edward Gowan, with whom he made the first recorded photographs of the ruined Buddhist stupa and monastery at Sanchi, near the holy Hindu city of Vidisha. In June 1861, an official circular issued under the authority of the Governor-General Lord Canning, was sent out encouraging military officers and others to collect photographs of ethnic and tribal types and in December 1861 Waterhouse was officially seconded to undertake a photographic tour of Central India (present-day Madhya Pradesh) for this purpose. This work occupied him for the whole of 1862 and involved a series of strenuous trips in Central India in search of suitable subjects: the best-known of this work is the series of portraits made of Sikandar Begum of Bhopal, her family and courtiers, taken in November of that year.For Waterhouse's own account of his photographic work in Central India, see Narrative of my tour in Malwa whilst engaged in photographing the tribes of Central India, British Library, India Office Records, Government of India Foreign Department Consultations (General Proceedings), no. 22 (July 1863), pp.34-37, IOR/P/205/14. A selection of these portraits was later included in John Forbes Watson and John William Kaye, The People of India (8 vols., India Museum, London, 1868\u201375), while views taken at Sanchi during the trip were used by the architectural historian James Fergusson in his Tree and Serpent Worship (India Museum, London, 1868)."]}, {"page": "Amaravati Marbles", "response": ["Although several proposals were put forward in the 1860s to transfer some of the India Museum collections to the British Museum, moves supported by Antonio Panizzi, administrative complexities prevented a speedy decision. In addition, John Forbes Watson (1827\u20131892), in charge of the India Museum from 1858, was determined to preserve the organization and lobbied energetically for a new building and the creation of an 'Imperial Museum for India and the Colonies'.Michael Willis, \"Sculpture from India,\" in A.W.

There was so little room that the Amaravati sculpture was sent to the India Office Stores in Lambeth. Some of the India Museum collections were slowly moved to the South Kensington Museum (forerunner of the V&A), where a three-year lease had been taken on some of the galleries there. This move coincided with the appointment of Dr. George Birdwood as the curator at South Kensington. After debates in and out of the House of Commons, Sir Louis Mallet (1823\u201390) asked Birdwood to prepare plans for the dispersal of the India Museum in 1879. The India Museum was then dissolved and the transfer of collections effected in 1880.Sir Louis Mallet (1823-90) was an authority on commercial policy and a supporter of free trade doctrine; in 1872 he was nominated to the Council of India; he was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India, 1874-83, for which see Michael Willis, \"Sculpture from India,\" in A.W.
