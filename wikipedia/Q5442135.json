He made as many as fourteen separate sound tracks. On one he had recorded fifty women shrieking; on another the groans of as many men; a third consisted of a dozen violinists scraping their bows across the strings on a single screeching note. These various tracks had then to be blended in different volumes and intensity until they produced a noise which seemed to him to resemble - on what authority is uncertain - 'the lid of hell being opened'. Supernatural horror was further increased by the pulsing heart-beat which heralded its every entrance. This sound, Olivier remembered, had been used by Jean-Louis Barrault in a stage production in Paris; he made it doubly effective on the screen by bringing the camera in and out of focus to synchronize with the pulsing. Before he would use it, however, he wrote to ask Barrault's permission and insisted on paying for the idea. Because no copyright is possible Olivier is particularly scrupulous about borrowing other people's production tricks or another actor's ideas.Barker, Felix (1953) The Oliviers pp259-260"]}, {"page": "Watkin's Tower", "response": ["*Information taken from London as it Might Have Been by Felix Barker and Ralph Hyde, 1982, "]}, {"page": "Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree", "response": ["The short initially received mixed reception.

E. H. Shepard felt the replacement was \"a complete travesty\", and Felix Barker of The Evening News ran a campaign opposed to the change. A. A.

However, after Disney's death, Boag's performance of the character was considered to be \"too zany for a children's film,\" and Paul Winchell, a ventriloquist, took the job instead. Following a British backlash to The Honey Tree led by film critic Felix Barker, Piglet was added to the short. For the part, Disney had heard John Fiedler's voice on television and selected him to voice the character. Although Fiedler's natural speaking voice was higher than most men's, he still had to raise it considerably to achieve the character's high pitch."]}, {"page": "Ralph Hyde", "response": ["Ralph Hyde (25 March 1939 \u2013 5 June 2015) was a curator of graphic arts at the Guildhall Library in London, a pre-eminent historian and writer on the subject of Panoramic painting.
