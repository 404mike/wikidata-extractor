The match on 12 December 1891 was played in terrible conditions, having snowed for more than two hours before kick-off. Nicol forced the ball over the line after a goalmouth scramble ensued from James Matthew's cross, with only seven minutes on the clock. Nicol was also involved in the build-up to the second goal, scored by Hugh Galbraith, while the third was scored by Billy Bowes after 35 minutes, although Rovers' goalkeeper, Herby Arthur contested the goal, claiming that the ball had not crossed the line. Rovers were reluctant to come out for the second half, in which they would be playing into the wind, and only seven players appeared for the restart. After Burnley's captain, Alex Stewart, and Blackburn's Joe Lofthouse had been sent off for fighting, the remaining Rovers players, with the exception of goalkeeper Arthur, walked off the pitch in protest. After a few farcical minutes, when Burnley's scored a \"goal\" which was disallowed as offside, the referee, Charles Clegg, abandoned the match with the scoreline at 3\u20130."]}, {"page": "William Bowes (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Billy Bowes, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Bowes"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Bowes"]}]}}
