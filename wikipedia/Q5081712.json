He also joined the Protestant Unionist Party (PUP), standing unsuccessfully for the group in Iveagh at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election.  The PUP soon reformed as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and Poots was elected to Lisburn Borough Council at the 1973 local elections.  He also won a seat in North Down at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election.  Contemporary reports claim that he started a fist-fight at the Assembly in December, after throwing a punch at Basil McIvor and he was suspended in 1974 for one day after calling Brian Faulkner a \"lying tramp\".Poots held his North Down seat on the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975, but he lost it at the 1982 Assembly election.
