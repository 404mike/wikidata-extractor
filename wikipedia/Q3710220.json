The problem had been tackled by Leonhard Euler in 1748 and Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1763 but without success.Whittaker (1949b) In 1776, Laplace published a memoir in which he first explored the possible influences of a purported luminiferous ether or of a law of gravitation that did not act instantaneously. He ultimately returned to an intellectual investment in Newtonian gravity.Gillispie (1989). pp. 29\u201335 Euler and Lagrange had made a practical approximation by ignoring small terms in the equations of motion. Laplace noted that though the terms themselves were small, when integrated over time they could become important. Laplace carried his analysis into the higher-order terms, up to and including the cubic. Using this more exact analysis, Laplace concluded that any two planets and the Sun must be in mutual equilibrium and thereby launched his work on the stability of the Solar System.Gillispie (1989), pp. 35\u201336 Gerald James Whitrow described the achievement as \"the most important advance in physical astronomy since Newton\"."]}, {"page": "Edward Arthur Milne", "response": ["Milne was a Christian theist.

Whittaker", "response": ["Whittaker died at his home, 48 George Square, Edinburgh, on 24 March 1956. He was buried at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Edinburgh, with \"mathematical precision at a depth of 6 ft. 6 inches\", according to the cemetery register. His entry in the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society was written by George Frederick James Temple in November 1956. He received published obituaries from Alexander Aitken, Herbert Dingle, Gerald James Whitrow, and William Hunter McCrea, among others. His house was owned by Edinburgh University and was demolished in the 1960s to expand the campus and now holds the William Robertson Building.", "Whittaker wrote three scientific treatises which were highly influential, A Course of Modern Analysis, Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, and The Calculus of Observations. In 1956, Gerald James Whitrow stated that two of them not only were required reading for British mathematicians, but were regarded as fundamental components of their personal libraries. Despite the success of these books and his other researchers and their influence in mathematics and physics, the second edition of Whittaker's A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity has been called his \"magnum opus\". In reference to the title's popularity, William Hunter McCrea predicted that future readers would have a hard time acknowledging it was the result of just \"a few years at both ends of a career of the highest distinction in other pursuits.\"", "Whittaker is also remembered for his role in the relativity priority dispute, a historic controversy over credit for the development of special relativity. In a chapter named \"The Relativity Theory of Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz\" in the second volume of the second edition of A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, Whittaker credited Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Hendrik Lorentz for developing the theory; he attributed to Einstein's special relativity paper relatively little importance, saying it \"set forth the relativity theory of Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz with some amplifications, and which attracted much attention\". Max Born, a friend of Whittaker's, wrote to Einstein expressing his concern about the book's publication and wrote a rebuttal in his 1956 book. The controversy was also mentioned in one of Whittaker's obituaries by Gerald James Whitrow, who said that he had written Whittaker a letter explaining how the latter's views \"did not do justice to the originality of Einstein's philosophy\", but remarked that he understood why Whittaker felt the need to correct the popular misconception that Einstein's contribution was unique. Max Born's rebuttal, published in his 1956 book, also argues that while the contributions of Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 should not be overlooked, it was the postulates and philosophy of Einstein's theory that \"distinguishes Einstein\u2019s work from his predecessors and gives us the right to speak of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, in spite of Whittaker\u2019s different opinion\". Though the dispute has lasted decades, most scholars have rejected Whittaker's arguments and scientific consensus has continued to hold that special relativity was Einstein's development."]}, {"page": "Gerald james whitrow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerald James Whitrow "]}, {"page": "Alternatives to general relativity", "response": ["| 1960, 1965 || Gerald James Whitrow, G.
