GFOTY's song \"Poison\" introduced nu-rave and industrial elements to the label's sound. Hannah Diamond's \"Hi\" was praised for its \"restrained\" sound and proving \"that PC Music wheelhouse is far larger than just chrome-painted dance pop.\" \"Super Natural\" features Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen, a choice that was noted for breaking the mould in comparison to the \"often metallicized\" and manipulated vocals usually present on PC Music songs. Many of the songs feature an \"allergy\" to the polyrhythms typical in dance music, like on \"Super Natural\" \"where beats, hand claps, and screamingly dense Eurodance keyboards are all pulsing at you as one\". \"Fade Away\" has been described as \"immensely satisfying trance-pop\".  \"A New Family\" by Felicita features \"horror-film whispers emerging from underneath the sort of crunchy torrent of sound favored by so-called post-club producers.\""]}]}}
