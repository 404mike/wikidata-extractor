By the second anniversary of his death, \u00a35.5 million had been raised in his memory.Sutton performed well at school, but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for colorectal cancer. His father had fought the disease twice, and both were predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome. Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as doctors did not believe that colorectal cancer could occur in someone so young. He made a \"bucket list\" of things to do in his final months and achieved many of them, such as becoming a Guinness World Records holder. He began fundraising for the Teenage Cancer Trust, receiving support from celebrities and politicians. In 2013, he met filmmaker Grigorij Richters, who recorded him for a documentary. \nSutton died on 14 May 2014 at the age of 19. A memorial service to him at Lichfield Cathedral was attended by over 10,000 mourners. After his death, he was posthumously recognised for his activism with awards including an MBE and an honorary doctorate from Coventry University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Virgin Trains", "response": ["On 15 September 2015 it was announced that Virgin Trains were to rename Pendolino 390002 in memory of teenage fundraiser Stephen Sutton."]}, {"page": "Burntwood", "response": ["* Stephen Sutton MBE (1994\u20132014) blogger for his blog Stephen's Story and charity activist for the Teenage Cancer Trust"]}, {"page": "Download Festival", "response": ["On 23 May, the Main stage was renamed the Stephen Sutton stage after Stephen Sutton who died on 14 May.", "!The Stephen Sutton Main Stage", "!The Stephen Sutton Main Stage", "!The Stephen Sutton Main Stage"]}, {"page": "British Rail Class 390", "response": ["| Stephen Sutton"]}, {"page": "Teenage Cancer Trust", "response": ["==Stephen Sutton==", "In April 2014, Stephen Sutton, a teenager with stage 3B colorectal cancer, raised the most money Teenage Cancer Trust had ever received from an individual fundraiser.
