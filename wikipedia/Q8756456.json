Alison felt a second dispensary was justified to meet the demands of the city's poor. The Royal Dispensary was only open two days a week and had no established system for home visiting. It received a royal charter on 13 January 1818, becoming the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "James Warburton Begbie", "response": ["He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1843 became a medical student in the University of Edinburgh. Of his teachers there, William Pulteney Alison appears to have influenced him most. In 1847 he proceeded M.D. with a dissertation 'On some of the Pathological Conditions of the Urine,' which received special commendation. He afterwards studied in Paris, paying special attention to diseases of the skin, under Cazenave and Devergie. About 1852 he settled in Edinburgh as a family practitioner, and was made fellow of the Royal College of Physicians there. In 1852 he married Miss Anna Maria Reid, by whom he had three sons and four daughters. Begbie was appointed Physician In-Ordinary (Scotland) to Queen Victoria's Medical Household in 1853. In 1854 he was appointed physician to the (temporary) cholera hospital in Edinburgh, and in 1855 physician to the Royal Infirmary, a post which he held for the statutory period of ten years. During the same time he gave clinical lectures in the Infirmary, and lectured on the practice of physic at the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine, where he gave also a short annual course of lectures on the history of medicine."]}]}}
