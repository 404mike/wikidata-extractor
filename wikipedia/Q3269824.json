Less popular was the three-volume biography and letters collection that Amelia published in 1830. In the ensuing years various collections of Heber's poetry appeared. Hughes observes that although some of the lighter verses are neat and amusing, the general quality is such that had Heber been only a poet, he would quickly have been forgotten. He achieved a more lasting niche as a hymn-writer; according to Hughes, among his hymns with enduring appeal are the Epiphany hymn \"Brightest and best of the sons of the morning\"; \"The Son of God Goes Forth to War\", dedicated to the church's saints and martyrs, and the Trinity Sunday hymn \"Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty\". The last one is probably the most widely known of all Trinity hymns and owes a great deal of its popularity to John Bacchus Dykes's tune \"Nicea\": Watson observes that the tune's \"magnificent grandeur carries the long lines effortlessly\".Watson 2002, p. 245 Hughes mentions two more Heber hymns that, he says, deserve to be better known: \"God that madest earth and heaven\" and \"By cool Siloam's shady rill\"."]}, {"page": "St Catharine's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|John Bacchus Dykes"]}, {"page": "Lead, Kindly Light", "response": ["It is usually sung to the tune Sandon by Charles H.
