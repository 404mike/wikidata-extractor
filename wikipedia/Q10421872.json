A creative inside-forward, he played 513 games in the league and FA Cup, scoring 122 goals. His father, also called Harry, was also a professional footballer.He spent seven seasons with Stoke from 1922 to 1929, helping the club to the Third Division North title in 1926\u201327. He then spent two seasons with Huddersfield Town, and featured in the 1930 FA Cup Final defeat to Arsenal. He made a return to Stoke in February 1932, and spent another six seasons at the Victoria Ground, helping the club to the Second Division title in 1932\u201333. Having scored 101 goals in 411 matches for the \"Potters\" in his two spells, he was traded to Port Vale in February 1938. He retired in April 1939, and later fought in World War II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barlaston", "response": ["* Harry Davies (1904\u20131975) an English footballer, played over 400 games for Stoke City & Port Vale, subsequently owner and landlord of the Plume of Feathers"]}, {"page": "Frank Soo", "response": ["Soo featured mainly for the Reserves during the 1934\u201335 campaign, as the forward line of Harry Davies, Joe Johnson, Bobby Liddle, Stanley Matthews and Tommy Sale proved to be highly effective, scoring 60 of the club's 71 league goals on the way to a tenth-place finish. He failed to make a first team appearance between September and 9 March, only returning to the side following a run of three consecutive defeats. He broke his leg during 1935\u201336 pre-season training, but made a speedy recovery to feature in a 2\u20130 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on 18 September. He found himself a first team regular under new manager Bob McGrory, who utilised him as a left-sided half-back in the place of ageing veteran Harry Sellars. Playing alongside Arthur Turner and Arthur Tutin, Soo would be a part of one of the club's great half-back lines.
