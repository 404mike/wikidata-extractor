The family lived in Leinster and held the lands of Slievemargy in present-day Co Laois and lands near Carlow. The family was forced from the lands with the arrival of the Normans and moved into Monaghan. According to James Frost, the family was likely driven from the lands by the Norman lord Walter de Riddlesford, who became the master of Carlow at around this time. A poem, written by Maoelin Oge MacBrody (the MacBrodys were the ollaves of the U\u00ed Bairrche), states that after the Mac Gorm\u00e1in family was driven from its lands a group of them made for Ulster and another made westwards towards Daire Seanleath in Uaithne Cliach (Uaithne Cliach is the modern barony of Owney, in Co Limerick). The family then settled in lands controlled by the O'Briens, settling in the area of Ibrackan. The Mac Gorm\u00e1in family of Ibrickan were known in the 15th century for their wealth, hospitality and their patronage of the Gaelic poets. The first of the family to settle in Munster was Murtagh, son of Donogh. The chiefs of the family held parts of the lands of Moyarta and Ibrackan in Co Clare. A branch of the family were hereditary marshalls to the O'Briens and held lands in Clare. The family is listed as one of the septs of Thomond in 1317.", "Murchadh mac Eachthighearn was driven from his territories of U\u00ed Bairrche by the Norman invaders Walter de Riddlesford, John de Clahull and Hugh de Lacy during the 1170s. Riddlesford, who took over as a master at Carlow, had married the daughter of a bastard son of a king Henry I of England which left him in a prominent position among his own people. At first Murchadh settled at Daire Seanleath in Uaithne Cliach (what is today Owney, County Limerick), but his son Cumeth mac Murchadh was invited by Donnchadh Cairprech \u00d3 Briain, King of Thomond to settle in U\u00ed Bhreac\u00e1in (what is known as Ibrickan, County Clare). In fact the Mac Gorm\u00e1in had built a good relationship with the \u00d3 Briain prior to the Norman invasion, as early as 1168, as Scanlan mac Gorm\u00e1in supported Domhnall M\u00f3r \u00d3 Briain, by witnessing for him a charter to the Holy Cross Abbey, Thurles."]}, {"page": "Kilkea", "response": ["Formerly the land of the \u00d3 Tuathails (O'Toole), after the Norman invasion, Sir Walter de Riddlesford built a motte and bailey castle there about 1180.
