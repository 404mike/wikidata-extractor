He spent most of his career with Newcastle United.\nMcFaul was born in Coleraine. He joined Newcastle United from Linfield in his native Northern Ireland in 1966 after impressing in a friendly match. It took two years for him to establish himself as Newcastle's goalkeeper, a position he held until after the 1974\u201375 season. His career highlight was probably when he helped Newcastle to the 1974 FA Cup Final at Wembley, but were beaten 3-0 by Liverpool, whose first two goals were from shots by Kevin Keegan and Steve Heighway that McFaul got his fingertips to but was unable to stop. McFaul played six times for Northern Ireland, it is generally agreed that it would have been many more times except for the fact that the position was held by Pat Jennings, one of the era's finest goalkeepers. McFaul was part of the Newcastle team that won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.He went on to serve Newcastle as player, coach, assistant manager and then finally, in 1985, as manager. He departed in October 1988 after a poor start saw early season optimism turn into an ultimately futile struggle against relegation.\nMcFaul's reputation was as a caring and loyal manager, who got the best out of a number of players including Peter Beardsley and Paul Goddard. His biggest contribution was probably his decision to make Paul Gascoigne an integral part of the first team despite his being only 18 at the time. McFaul has since managed teams in Northern Ireland and worked as the coach of the national team of Guam. In Northern Ireland he managed his hometown club Coleraine who are very close to his heart. Things didn't go to plan and his spell as manager coincided with a lowly period in Coleraine history. He did, however, discover Paul Gaston, who went on to captain Coleraine and play over 600 games for the club.\nMcFaul is now working as a scout for Norwich City, professional connections having been made with Norwich Manager Glenn Roeder during Roeder's time as Newcastle United manager.\nMany Northern Ireland fans reflect that his true ability was never fully seen at international level due to it being the Pat Jennings era.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["United dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the 1977\u201378 season. Dinnis was replaced by Bill McGarry, and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the 1983\u201384 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in 1989.

Newcastle finished 11th in the First Division that season and, at the end of it, Gascoigne was featured on the front cover of the Rothmans Football Yearbook.

The match was being covered by the BBC with a young John Motson commentating. It was originally scheduled for a small slot on Match of the Day later that evening. Newcastle United went 1\u20130 ahead in the last ten minutes, and with the tie seemingly settled, Radford won a tackle in the Newcastle United half and played a one-two with Brian Owen (who had scored the first goal at Newcastle). The return pass bobbled on the muddy surface but sat up nicely for Radford, and he unleashed a 30-yard strike into the top corner that beat Willie McFaul to equalise. The goal sparked a pitch invasion, and the images of the muddy pitch, Radford celebrating with arms aloft and the crowd invading the pitch, have since become immortalised in FA Cup history."]}, {"page": "History of Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["One of English footballs greatest talents, Paul Gascoigne or 'Gazza', emerged as an exciting 18-year-old midfielder in 1985-86, under Newcastle's next manager Jack Charlton, who left after only one season despite Newcastle achieving a secure mid-table finish on their return to the First Division. His successor was former player Willie McFaul. Newcastle consolidated their place in Division One but then a period of selling their best players (Beardsley to Liverpool, and Waddle and eventually Gascoigne both to Tottenham), rocked the club and led to supporter unrest, as did a share-war for control of the boardroom. The effect of this on the pitch soon proved evident, as McFaul was sacked after a dismal start to the 1988\u201389 season, and new boss Jim Smith was unable to turn Newcastle around, resulting in them finishing at the foot of the First Division in 1989 and dropping back into the Second Division."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Willie McFaul||||GK||1966\u20131975||290||0||"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 in English football", "response": ["10 October 1988 \u2013 Howard Wilkinson ends six years as Sheffield Wednesday manager by agreeing to drop down a division to join Leeds United,Howard Wilkinson: Managerial career. soccerbase.
