By then his fame as a teacher was attracting a regular stream of pupils, including Cambridge undergraduates who read with him during the long vacation and others who were preparing for entry to the university. For a fee of about 5 shillings a week for unlimited tuition, in addition to the cost of accommodation and food, sometimes in Dawson's house but more commonly in a local inn, pupils were taught in a characteristic peripatetic fashion. As Adam Sedgwick, who read with him in 1804 before going up to Cambridge and subsequently during vacations, recalled, Dawson would seat his pupils, often a dozen or more, at tables about the house and move constantly from one to another, correcting and advising. Dawson's method achieved remarkable results. Between 1781 and 1794, at least seven, possibly eight, of the fourteen senior wranglers at Cambridge had been taught by him, as had four others between 1797 and 1807. Among these were the future chancery barrister John Bell, the Arabist John Palmer, the lawyer and anti-slavery campaigner Thomas Harrison, James Inman, who went on to become professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and George Butler, later headmaster of Harrow and dean of Peterborough, whose vivid account of the journey of almost five days between London and Sedbergh and his introduction to Dawson was published in The Sedberghian for December 1881. Pupils who went on to Cambridge and did not achieve the rank of senior wrangler included, in addition to Richard and Adam Sedgwick and Haygarth, the lord chief justice Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, the mathematician Miles Bland, who was at Sedbergh School, and several bishops. Among those whose medical interests took them to Edinburgh rather than Cambridge were Robert Willan, Thomas Garnett, and George Birkbeck."]}, {"page": "George Butler", "response": ["George Butler may refer to:", "* George Butler (record producer) (1931\u20132008), American record producer", "* George Butler (filmmaker) (1944\u20132021), American filmmaker", "* George Butler (headmaster) (1774\u20131853), English schoolmaster and churchman, also his son (1819\u20131890)", "* George Butler (1819\u20131890), English divine and schoolmaster", "* George Butler (cricketer, born 1810) (1810\u20131887), English cricketer", "* George Butler (cricketer, born 1900) (1900\u20131969), English cricketer", "* George Butler, 5th Marquess of Ormonde (1890\u20131949)"]}, {"page": "Rede Lecture", "response": ["*1798 George Butler (Logic)"]}, {"page": "Dean of Peterborough", "response": ["*1842\u20131853 George Butler"]}, {"page": "John Bowen (bishop)", "response": ["On 24 November 1857, he married Catharine Butler, second daughter of Dr. George Butler, dean of Peterborough.
