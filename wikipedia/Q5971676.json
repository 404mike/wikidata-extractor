His clients included rock band Badfinger, musician Al Kooper, and singer Lou Christie. Throughout his career, Polley defrauded a number of clients and associates.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Badfinger", "response": ["===Signing with Stan Polley===", "In April 1970, while in the US scouting prospects for a tour, Collins was introduced to New York businessman Stan Polley, who signed Badfinger to a business management contract in November 1970. Polley established Badfinger Enterprises, Inc., with Stan Poses as vice-president. It bound the band members to various contracts dictating that income from touring, recording, publishing, and even songwriter performance royalties would be directed into holding companies controlled by Polley. It led to a salary arrangement for the band, which various members later complained was inadequate compared to their gross earnings. Gibbins said: \"My first impression was, Stan [Polley] is a powerful guy,\" while Molland thought that Polley seemed more of a father-figure. At the same time, Polley was also managing Al Kooper, of Blood, Sweat & Tears, and Lou Christie.", "Although Polley's professional reputation was admired, his dubious financial practices eventually contributed to the band's downfall. A financial statement prepared by Polley's accountants, Sigmund Balaban & Co., for the period from 8 December 1970 to 31 October 1971, showed Polley's income from the band: \"Salaries and advances to client, $8,339 (Joey Molland), $6,861 (Mike Gibbins), $6,211 (Tom Evans), $5,959 (Pete Ham). Net corporation profit, $24,569. Management commission, $75,744 (Stan Polley)\". Although it is not known if the band members saw the statement, Collins certainly had, as his handwriting was on the document.", "On the night of 23 April 1975, Ham received a phone call from the United States, telling him that all his money had disappeared. Later that night he met Tom Evans and they went to The White Hart Pub in Surrey together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o'clock on the morning of 24 April 1975. Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning. His suicide note\u2014addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair\u2014blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life. The note read: \"Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me\". Ham died at the age of 27. Ham had shown growing signs of mental illness over the past months, with Gibbins remembering Ham burning cigarettes on his hands and arms. He was cremated at the Morriston Crematorium, Swansea; his ashes were spread in the memorial gardens. Ham's daughter, Petera, was born one month after his death.  In May, Warner Bros terminated its contract with Badfinger, and Badfinger dissolved.  Around that time, Apple also deleted all of Badfinger's albums from its catalogue.", "Joey Molland's wife, Kathie Molland, died on 24 March 2009, and Stan Polley died on 20 July 2009 in California."]}, {"page": "Straight Up (Badfinger album)", "response": ["While attractive to American audiences, the association with the Beatles, partly through Badfinger being an Apple Records act, continued to hinder the band's attempts to forge their own identity. Having already tired of playing their debut hit song, the Paul McCartney-written \"Come and Get It\", Badfinger would experience similar artistic compromises during the production of Straight Up.Matovina, pp. 138\u201339. In other areas of the group's operation, all four members signed a management deal with American agent Stan Polley in November 1970, and the band hired part of Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire as a base for songwriting and rehearsing."]}, {"page": "Pete Ham", "response": ["Warner Bros.

Helped by backing vocalist Linda Scott and by two promotional videos distinctly different from each other, the song peaked at No. 10 in the US, but climbed to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and thus became his biggest hit there."]}, {"page": "Badfinger (album)", "response": ["As Badfinger were completing work on their last album for Apple Records, Ass, the band's manager, Stan Polley, signed them to a three-year, six-album deal with Warner Bros.

As a result, shortly after the band and producer Chris Thomas completed recording of Ass, they found themselves back in the studio making a new album for Warner."]}, {"page": "Head First (Badfinger album)", "response": ["The remaining members of Badfinger recorded Head First in just two weeks. The difficult circumstances that surrounded Badfinger at this time contribute to the album's tone and provide the theme for two of its songs. In particular, an investigation by WB's publishing division discovered that approximately $100,000 was missing from a Badfinger escrow account. Inquiries made by WB as to the whereabouts of the money were reportedly met with silence by Badfinger's manager, American Stan Polley. Suspicions were aroused, and, fed up with what it claimed was a lack of cooperation, WB launched a \"breach of contract\" suit against Polley and Badfinger virtually simultaneously with the Head First recording sessions, which also sought to attach the royalties due from Wish You Were Here. Consequently, WB suspended sales of Wish You Were Here.", "It appeared for many years that Head First would never be released, as the litigation between WB and Stan Polley remained unresolved, the master tapes had been misplaced, and the audio quality of known copies was so poor as to be unusable. However, four remixed and remastered songs from the master tapes for Head First \u2014 \"Lay Me Down\", \"Passed Fast\", \"Keep Believing\", and \"Moonshine\" \u2014 turned up on the original Rhino Records CD Best of Badfinger Vol. 2 (featuring Badfinger songs recorded for WB and Elektra after the band's departure from Apple Records), which was released in 1990. These songs were eventually removed from the CD after the unresolved litigation was brought to Rhino's attention. The current status of the original master tapes is unclear."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2009", "response": ["*Stan Polley, 87, American music manager."]}, {"page": "Polley", "response": ["*Stan Polley (died 2009), entertainment manager from the 1960s and 1970s"]}, {"page": "April 1922", "response": ["**Stan Polley, U.S. entertainment agent and manager later convicted of defrauding numerous clients; in New York City (d. 2009)"]}]}}
