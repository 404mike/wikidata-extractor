Important collections include Latvian, Norwegian, Gotlandic and Merovingian material from Johann Karl B\u00e4hr, Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period is the magnificent items from the Sutton Hoo royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner Edith Pretty. The late mediaeval collection includes a large number of seal-dies from across Europe, the most famous of which include those from the Town of Boppard in Germany, Isabella of Hainault from her tomb in Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris, Inchaffray Abbey in Scotland and Robert Fitzwalter, one of the Barons who led the revolt against King John in England. There is also a large collection of medieval signet rings, prominent among them is the gold signet ring belonging to Jean III de Grailly who fought in the Hundred Years' War, as well as those of Mary, Queen of Scots and Richard I of England. Other groups of artifacts represented in the department include the national collection of (c.100) icon paintings, most of which originate from the Byzantine Empire and Russia, and over 40 mediaeval astrolabes from across Europe and the Middle East. The department also includes the national collection of horology with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the Morgan and Ilbert collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of Romano-British objects \u2013 the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside Italy. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in East Anglia, the most important of which is the Mildenhall Treasure. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian Charles Roach Smith in 1856. These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection. The department also includes ethnographic material from across Europe including a collection of Bulgarian costumes and shadow puppets from Greece and Turkey. A particular highlight are the three S\u00e1mi drums from northern Sweden of which only about 70 are extant."]}, {"page": "Frederick William Fairholt", "response": ["His principal works are Tobacco, its History and Association (1859); Gog and Magog (1860); Up the Nile and Home Again (1862); many articles and serials contributed to the Art Journal, some of which were afterwards separately published, as Costume in England (1846); and Dictionary of Terms in Art (1854).

To achieve this, workmen removed two of the sarsens from the revetment kerb and placed them in the corner of the wood to the south of the monument. In the early 1840s, the Reverend Beale Post conducted investigations into the Medway Megaliths, writing them up in a manuscript that was left unpublished; this included Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow, which he collectively labelled the \"Addington Circles\". Thomas Wright recorded that in 1845 a local parson, the Reverend Lambert Blackwell Larking, dug into a chamber at Addington, discovering \"fragments of rude pottery\". From the context in which Wright wrote, it seems that Addington Long Barrow is referred to, although it remains possible that Chestnuts was the barrow in question.

Beyond St Mary Bourne, near Finkley and East Anton, Port Way was crossed by Margary route 43, the road from Venta Belgarum to Cunetio (Mildenhall) sometimes described as being part of the Icknield Way. Approximately  east of this crossroads was a mansio, the only significant settlement on the Port Way other than its termini. Hoare believed that this was the settlement of Vindomis, and the Ordnance Survey's 25 inch to the mile map of 1895 marks it as \"ROMAN STATION / Supposed to be VINDOMIS\". Charles Roach Smith wrote that the distance of Vindomis from Calleva Atrebatum given in the Antonine Itinerary \u2013  \u2013 did not \"materially clash\" with the idea that Vindomis was the settlement at this intersection. Despite this, Francis J. Haverfield wrote in 1915 that \"there was no town or village at the crossing; so far as we know, there was not even a house at all\". Contrary to Hoare's belief that this was the site of Vindomis, the discovery of the Calleva Atrebatum to Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester) road led to the consensus that the settlement was in the area of present-day Neatham near Alton. No later than the 1730s, John Horsley had suggested that Vindomis was in the vicinity of Farnham (some  from Neatham). If not Vindomis, the settlement at the East Anton crossroads may have been Leucomagus."]}, {"page": "1807 in archaeology", "response": ["* August 20 - Charles Roach Smith, British archaeologist; co-founder of the British Archaeological Association  (d. 1890)"]}, {"page": "Charles Boutell", "response": ["Boutell served as Honorary Secretary of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society from 23 July to 27 November 1857, but was dismissed for what was termed \"improper\" bookkeeping, involving the amount of \u00a356 15s received in subscription fees.Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, vol. 1 (1856\u201360), pp. 203\u20134, 209, 314\u20137.

Uncovering about 750 graves, he made detailed records in his field notebooks noting anatomical details, but like Browne before him, he mistakenly attributed them to Roman-Britain. Following his death in 1776, Faussett's notes were written up and published in 1856 as the Inventorium Sepulchrale by Charles Roach Smith, who added his own commentary to the work.", "Although some antiquarians had made attempts to excavate and catalog the Anglo-Saxon grave-sites, on the whole, such sites were commonly damaged and destroyed in eighteenth and early nineteenth-century England, with a little attempt being made to properly study them.
