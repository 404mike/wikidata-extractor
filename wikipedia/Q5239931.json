He came into the squad with a good goal scoring record for both the reserve side and youth sides and it wasn't long before he made his break got his break within the first team. During the 2002\u201303 season, Town manager Paul Groves had been dealt several blows by the loss of loanee Steve Kabba as well as injuries to other forwards such as Michael Boulding while Phil Jevons was loaned out for financial reasons, this in turn saw Groves forced to select inexperienced youngsters such as Mansaram and David Soames. Despite impressing in the final half of the season, Mansaram was powerless in helping Grimsby avoid relegation from the First Division, however by the end of the season his performances had meant he was now considered as a first team regular. During the summer months he drew interest from Sheffield Wednesday but no concrete offer came in and the young striker nicknamed 'Flash' due to his lightning pace up front, stayed on at Blundell Park. Paul Groves eventually lost his job in February 2004 and was replaced by Nicky Law who in turn chopped and changed the Grimsby squad meaning signings such as Isaiah Rankin meant that Mansaram by the end of that season had found himself only playing a cameo role within the first team. Following a second successive relegation the Grimsby board installed another new manager in Russell Slade, and Mansaram now out of contract was kept on at the club during pre-season on a trial basis but despite being initially told he wasn't going to be offered a new deal he eventually signed on a 6-month deal. During the 2004\u201305 season, he was loaned out to Conference National side Halifax Town, and eventually moved to the club on a free transfer."]}, {"page": "Wes Parker (footballer)", "response": ["Parker was a product of the Grimsby Town youth setup and made his move into the first team in October 2002 when the club were playing in the First Division. Parker and striker David Soames were promoted into the first team following injuries to senior players and would go on to make his first team debut under manager Paul Groves, who with first team defenders Steve Chettle, Georges Santos, John McDermott and Darren Barnard in the Mariners squad, Parker had a collective group of veteran role models to follow. In his most notable appearance for the club, Parker was drafted in to make a substitute appearance on Boxing Day 2002 when the club played against Derby County at Pride Park . With the majority of Grimsby's regular back four side lined through injury, Parker came on to replace Terry Cooke in a game in which he marked former Manchester City legend Georgi Kinkladze out of the game. Goals from David Soames and a double from John Oster polished off Derby in a 3\u20131 victory. Grimsby were relegated from the First Division in the 2002\u20132003 season and in the 2003\u20132004 season Parker failed to make an impact under Groves and his later replacement Nicky Law.
