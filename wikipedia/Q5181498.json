In Oxford's match against Wrexham on 21 August 2008, Foster was sent off after just 11 minutes for \"denying Wrexham's Shaun Whalley a clear goalscoring opportunity\". As a result, he missed the next two games, returning to the first-team against Ebbsfleet United on 30 August 2008, but was once again sent off, this time for a foul on Craig Stone. Consequently, Foster did not play again in the first-team for a month. He regained his place in Oxford's defence, and played regularly until the end of the season. He scored his only goal of the season in a 2\u20131 victory over Lewes in February 2009. Foster made 44 appearances for the club during the season, scoring one goal, as Oxford narrowly missed out on a place in the Conference Premier play-offs. The following campaign, Foster was again a regular under manager Chris Wilder, appearing in all of Oxford's games up until December 2009. He scored his first goal of the season in Oxford's 1\u20131 draw against Barrow on 3 October 2009. Foster was sent off in a 1\u20131 draw against Barrow in the FA Cup on 28 November 2009, resulting in Barrow being awarded a penalty kick and subsequently scoring. In January 2010, Wilder stated that Oxford would not be extending Foster's contract in the summer, with Foster \"wanting that option to pursue offers from other clubs\"."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Craig Stone", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Craig Stone", "| Craig Stone"]}]}}
