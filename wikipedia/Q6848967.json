He is the uncle of fellow footballer Ian Stringfellow.Stringfellow began his career at Mansfield Town whom he joined as a schoolboy in 1957. He was a star in Mansfield's youth team, and signed a professional contract in February 1960, shortly after his 17th birthday. He made his first-team debut six months later, playing as an outside-left in the game against Rochdale on 30 August 1960.Despite his young age, Stringfellow remained a regular in the Mansfield Town side, and scored 12 goals in 65 appearances for the Stags, before moving to Leicester City for \u00a325,000 in January 1962 \u2013 the highest transfer fee ever paid for an 18-year-old at the time.By his second season at Filbert Street, Stringfellow was a regular in the Leicester side. He was a member of the Leicester side that lost against Manchester United in the 1963 FA Cup Final, and scored one of the goals when the Foxes won the League Cup the following season with a 4\u20133 aggregate win against Stoke City.\nIn 1968, Stringfellow's career was curtailed by a serious cartilage injury. Nevertheless, he remained on Leicester's books, mostly in a reserve role, until 1975 when he quit the professional game and finished his career with non-league Nuneaton Borough. In all competitions, Stringfellow played 377 games for Leicester and scored 98 goals.After his retirement from football, Stringfellow settled in Enderby, Leicestershire, where he worked as a newsagent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["City ended the 1963\u201364 season in 11th place, having been inconsistent all season.
