He came on for his debut as an 80th-minute substitute for Lee Martin, and less than two minutes later scored. However, in the 89th minute, he was substituted for fellow debutant Alfie Pavey due to injury and Millwall lost 2\u20134. After an unfortunate lay-off through injury, Philpot returned to first team action for The Lions after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 3\u20130 win against Blackpool.
