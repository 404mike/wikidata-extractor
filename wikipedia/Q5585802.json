Wanting to do something darker and noisier, Gordon Sharp and David Clancy took ideas from The Freeze to a greater extreme; the result was the formation of Cindytalk in 1982.", "The Freeze were formed in 1976 by Gordon Sharp, David Clancy and Keith Grant, all pupils together at school in Linlithgow, West Lothian. Grangemouth based drummer George Falconer played with the band during 1977. Most notable gig during this period was a support slot for Dunfermline band The Skids. The set consisted of originals and covers of The Ramones and Brian Eno. At this time, \"The Freeze\" didn't fit in at all with the vogue \"punk look and attitude\" of the time, having an angry sound but more an affinity with  bands such as Television and Talking Heads. Clancy used several effects pedals on the guitar to add depth, volume and interest to his sound. On occasion, Sharp would use a knife on the guitar whilst Clancy played, creating a challenging but glorious noise. Sharp and Falconer shared a liking for synth music, even the guilty pleasure of Vangelis, which during the punk rock era was not on. At the early stages, The Freeze were showing an interest in sound beyond the mainstream of punk or rock. Falconer left to join Falkirk band \"The Deft Jerks\", but met Gordon Sharp several years later. Gordon had a dress on under a denim jacket, and wore thick make up; still not fitting in, doing his own thing. By 1977 and after linking up with drummer Graeme Radin, the band started gigging around Scotland (managed by Alastair Allison, their English teacher at Linlithgow Academy, who also contributed lyrics in the early years); they  often played support to many of the main punk and new wave bands of the day. Two self-financed 7\u00a0inches were released on the A1 label (Alastair Allison), 1979's In Colour EP followed by 1980's \"Celebration/Crossover\" single. Noticed by John Peel, they were to record two sessions at Maida Vale for his show. By 1982 the band had decided on a name change to Cindytalk and also subsequently moved to London. In 1983, Gordon Sharp joined central Scotland chums Cocteau Twins in the BBC studios to add vocals to their second Peel session. 1984 saw the release of the first and critically acclaimed Cindytalk album Camouflage Heart, as well as the release of It'll End in Tears by This Mortal Coil, on which Sharp provided vocals for three tracks, including indie chart-topper \"Kangaroo\" (which was also one of Peel's Festive 50's from 1984). Cindytalk have continued to release recordings over the years and are still active today.", "*Gordon Sharp - vocals", "Gordon Sharp - vocals", "Gordon Sharp - vocals"]}, {"page": "A Life Is Everywhere", "response": ["A Life Is Everywhere is the fourth album from Cindytalk released by Editions Mego, released in 2013.
