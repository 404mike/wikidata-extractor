He had a relatively short period as their first choice goalkeeper, in between the spells of Charlie Shaw and John Thomson. He did take part in winning the Scottish Cup in 1925, the Scottish Football League in 1925\u201326 and the Glasgow Cup in 1926\u201327 (having played in the team that lost in the finals of both that competition and the Scottish Cup in the previous year).He later played for South Shields and Nelson in England, was player-manager of Shelbourne in Ireland, then returned to Scotland with Hamilton Academical (where injury cost him a place in the 1935 Scottish Cup Final) and Albion Rovers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shelbourne F.C.", "response": ["*  Peter Shevlin (1931\u201333)Shevlin, Peter (1933), Hamilton Academical Memory Bank"]}, {"page": "John Thomson (footballer, born 1909)", "response": ["Celtic manager Willie Maley sent his chief scout Steve Callaghan to watch the Denbeath Star goalkeeper but instead Callaghan came back with a rave review about Thomson. After watching him playing against Denbeath Star on 20 October 1926, Celtic signed 17-year-old Thomson for \u00a310. On 5 February 1927, Celtic beat Brechin City 6\u20133, but Maley was concerned by the fact his first choice 'keeper, Peter Shevlin, had conceded three soft goals so decided to give 18-year-old Thomson a chance in the next game, which was against Dundee. He kept his place in the team after this match, and helped Celtic to finish second in the Scottish First Division. He also played in Celtic's 1927 Scottish Cup Final victory as they beat East Fife 3\u20131. The following season, after an Old Firm match where Celtic played against their rivals Rangers at Ibrox Park, Thomson received widespread praise from the press following an \"immense\" performance. On 5 February 1930, Thomson was seriously injured in a game against Airdrieonians: he broke his jaw, fractured several ribs, damaged his collar bone, and lost two teeth when making a diving save. On 11 April 1931, Thomson won the second medal of his career as Celtic beat Motherwell 4\u20132 in the 1931 Scottish Cup Final.
