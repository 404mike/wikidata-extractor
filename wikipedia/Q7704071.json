Tom Johnston had retired, due to old age and losing the respect of the playing faithful. Buxton set about revitalising the club, he demanded respect from the players and brought in harder training sessions which were taken by himself and John Haselden who had been promoted to Assistant Manager as well as taking over Physio duties. He signed Ian Robins, Peter Fletcher and off-loaded players such as Kevin Johnson, Terry Gray and Bobby Campbell. The 1979\u201380 season proved to be the start of the revolution under Buxton where Town won the 4th Division Championship and scored 101 goals in the process. Buxton also won the Bell's Manager of the Year award for the Fourth Division. The following season Buxton set the club's then-record transfer fee of \u00a3110,000 for Terry Austin, but it was his first signing, Ian Robins, together with earlier acquisitions, Steve Kindon and Brian Stanton, who set the club alight, scoring a combined total of 41 goals as Town finished just outside the promotion places."]}, {"page": "Ipswich Town F.C. in European football", "response": ["Ipswich finished fourth in the 1973\u201374 Football League First Division, qualifying for the 1974\u201375 UEFA Cup, and were drawn against FC Twente in the first round.

The return leg took place two weeks later in Enschede.   scored for Twente after eight minutes, but Hamilton equalised for Ipswich six minutes later; the game ended 1\u20131 and 3\u20133 on aggregate, which sent Ipswich out of the competition on the away goals rule.  Finishing third in the 1974\u201375 Football League First Division, Ipswich qualified for the 1975\u201376 UEFA Cup where they faced the favourites for the cup, Dutch club Feyenoord in the first round.  The first leg, in Rotterdam, ended 2\u20131 to Ipswich with goals from Johnson and Whymark, the consolation for Feyenoord coming from Theo de Jong.  Once again crowd trouble threatened, but the thousand \"green-bereted commandos\" in attendance helped to maintain order.  Two weeks later at Portman Road, Ipswich took a two-goal first-half lead through Woods and Whymark, and held out against a \"blitz of aggressive and elegant football\" in the second half for a 4\u20131 aggregate victory. F.C. Bruges were to be Ipswich's second round opponent, with the first leg at Portman Road in October 1975.
