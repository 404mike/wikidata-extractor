A secret British society called the \"Order of Chaeronea\" campaigned for the legalization of homosexuality, and counted playwright Oscar Wilde among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.McKenna, Neil (2003), \"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography\". (London: Century)  The society was founded by George Cecil Ives, one of the earliest gay rights campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the \"Cause\". Ives met Wilde at the Authors' Club in London in 1892. Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his mustache, and once kissed him passionately in the Travellers' Club. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the Order of Chaeronea. Members included Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson."]}, {"page": "Walt Whitman", "response": ["Peter Doyle may be the most likely candidate for the love of Whitman's life.Reynolds, 487. Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: \"We were familiar at once\u2014I put my hand on his knee\u2014we understood. He did not get out at the end of the trip\u2014in fact went all the way back with me.\"Kaplan, 311\u2013312. In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code \"16.4\" (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in the United States in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question\u2014\"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips.\"Stokes, John Oscar Wilde: Myths, Miracles and Imitations, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 194 Note 7. The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal.Arthur, Gavin The Circle of Sex, University Books, New York 1966. Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his \"Calamus\" poems were homosexual\u2014John Addington Symonds inquired about \"athletic friendship,\" \"the love of man for man,\" or \"the Love of Friends\"\u2014he chose not to respond.Reynolds, 527. The manuscript of his love poem \"Once I Pass'd Through A Populous City\", written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man."]}, {"page": "J. M. Barrie", "response": ["After the First World War, Barrie sometimes stayed at Stanway House near the village of Stanway in Gloucestershire. He paid for the pavilion at Stanway cricket ground. In 1887, he founded an amateur cricket team for friends of similarly limited playing ability, and named it the Allahakbarries under the mistaken belief that \"Allah akbar\" meant \"Heaven help us\" in Arabic (rather than \"God is great\"). Some of the best known British authors from the era played on the team at various times, including H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Conan Doyle, P. G. Wodehouse, Jerome K. Jerome, G. K. Chesterton, A. A. Milne, E. W. Hornung, A. E. W. Mason, Walter Raleigh, E. V. Lucas, Maurice Hewlett, Owen Seaman (editor of Punch), Bernard Partridge, George Cecil Ives, George Llewelyn Davies (see below) and the son of Alfred Tennyson. In 1891, Barrie joined the newly formed Authors Cricket Club and also played for its cricket team, the Authors XI, alongside Doyle, Wodehouse and Milne. The Allahakbarries and the Authors XI continued to exist side by side until 1912."]}, {"page": "1950 in literature", "response": ["*June 4 \u2013 George Cecil Ives, German-born English poet, writer and reformer (born 1867)"]}, {"page": "Ives", "response": ["* George Cecil Ives (1867\u20131950), poet, writer, penal reformer and early gay rights campaigner"]}, {"page": "George Ives", "response": ["* George Cecil Ives (1867\u20131950), German-British poet, writer, penal reformer and early gay rights campaigner"]}, {"page": "E. W. Hornung", "response": ["The fictional character Stingaree proved to be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in Cassell's Magazine, A. J. Raffles. The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the Albany, a gentlemen's only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series \"In the Chains of Crime\" was published in June that year, titled \"The Ides of March\". The stories were collected into one volume\u2014with two additional tales\u2014under the name The Amateur Cracksman, which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school fag) Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson\u2014although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders \"were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie\" (Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas).\u2014and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: \"To A.C.D. This form of flattery\". Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that \"there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal the hero\". The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle's fears. The reviewer in The Spectator wrote that \"stern moralists\" would consider the book's premise \"as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin\". The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left The Spectator reviewer \"expressing [their] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue.\""]}, {"page": "Bentworth", "response": ["In 1832 the Fitzherbert family sold the Bentworth Hall estate at an auction in London to Roger Staples Horman Fisher for approximately \u00a36000. Almost immediately Fisher started building the present Bentworth Hall. In 1848 the estate was sold to Jeremiah Robert Ives. The Ives family later shared ownership with the author George Cecil Ives who lived for a time at the hall with his paternal grandmother. In 1898 a station for the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway was proposed which would serve Bentworh, Lasham and the village of Shalden. Land was taken from the villages of Bentworth and Lasham to provide for the railway station. In 1870\u201372 the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales by John Marius Wilson described Bentworth as", "In Elizabethan times, the poet and writer George Wither (1588\u20131667) was born in Bentworth and baptised in St Mary's church. In Victorian times, the author George Cecil Ives lived at the post-1832 Bentworth Hall with his mother Emma Gordon-Ives. A memorial to the Ives family is in the churchyard close to the school and has a stone slab for George Ives that reads \"George Cecil Ives MA, author, 1867\u20131950, Late of Bentworth Hall.\" The stone slab for his mother reads \"The Honourable Emma, wife of J.R. Ives, Daughter of Viscount Maynard Lord Lieutenant of Essex, died March 14, 1896 aged 84.\"", "George Cecil Ives (1867\u20131950), an author, criminologist and homosexual law reform campaigner,  spent time at the family home at Bentworth Hall."]}, {"page": "Order of Chaeronea", "response": ["The Order of Chaeronea was a secret society for the cultivation of a homosexual moral, ethical, cultural and spiritual ethos. It was founded by George Cecil Ives in 1897, as a result of his belief that homosexuals would not be accepted openly in society and must therefore have a means of underground communication.Cook, London and the Culture of Homosexuality 1885-1914, Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp.137-40", "In 1893, shortly after meeting Wilde, George Cecil Ives, a friend of Wilde's whose diaries contain many new details of the writer's life, founded a secret society called the Order of Chaeronea, aimed at promoting 'the Cause'.Neil McKenna, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, Arrow Books, 2004 The society was named \"after the battle where the male lovers of the Theban Band were slaughtered in 338 BC.\" Ives and other members dated letters and other materials from the year of the battle, so that 1900 would be written as C.2238."]}]}}
