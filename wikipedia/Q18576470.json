The younger Donaldson moved to Glasgow and opened a music academy in 1816, but in the 1820s qualified as an advocate and ceased teaching. He was nevertheless well-regarded as a pianist and produced a Sonata in G minor in 1822. He developed an interest in acoustics. According to The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, he first took an interest in the Reid Professorship of Music at the University of Edinburgh in 1838; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that he first applied for the position in 1841. He was eventually appointed to it in 1845, and aimed to transform music teaching at the university. He purchased a large array of scientific equipment and instruments, established regular lecture series, and made acoustic experiments. But this was not achieved without opposition from the trustees of Reid's bequest; he spent five years engaged in legal proceedings to extract greater allowances to cover teaching, equipment and building space. He won, and the university was ordered to pay for a music room, which became the Reid School of Music. His health suffered under the stress of the legal proceedings, however, and he died in 1865.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Donaldson", "response": ["John Donaldson may refer to:", "*John Donaldson (agriculturalist) (1799\u20131876), British agriculturalist and professor of botany", "*John Donaldson (economist) (born 1948), economist at Columbia Business School", "*John Donaldson (music scholar) (1789\u20131865), English music scholar and educator", "*John Donaldson (Australian politician) (1841\u20131896), Treasurer of Queensland", "*John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington (1920\u20132005), British judge", "*John Donaldson (Australian cricketer) (born 1950), Australian cricketer", "*John Donaldson (New Zealand cricketer) (1919\u20131984), New Zealand cricketer", "*John Donaldson (footballer), Scottish footballer", "*John Donaldson (pitcher) (1891\u20131970), baseball pitcher in the Negro leagues", "*John Donaldson (second baseman) (born 1943), baseball player in the American League", "*John Donaldson (American football) (1925\u20132018), American football player", "*William John Donaldson (born 1958), known as John Donaldson, chess player", "*John Donaldson (author) (c. 1921\u20131989), British author and poet", "*John Donaldson (painter) (1737\u20131801), miniature painter"]}, {"page": "Reid Professor of Music", "response": ["*John Donaldson (1845\u20131865)"]}, {"page": "Reid Concert Hall", "response": ["The Reid Concert Hall is a small music venue in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is located in the south-western corner of Bristo Square  about  south of the Royal Mile, and is part of the University of Edinburgh.

The hall is named after General John Reid, an army officer and musician who founded the Chair of Music (Reid Professor of Music) at the university. The Reid Concerts take place every 13 February.", "When the Reid Hall was built, Professor John Donaldson (1789-1865) also added a museum gallery to display his private collection of  old and unusual musical instruments. The Reid Hall is considered to be the oldest purpose-built musical museum in Europe. Today, the North Room houses the John Donaldson Collection of Musical Instruments, which, along with the Russell Collection, forms part of the Musical Instruments collection of the University of Edinburgh."]}]}}
