Howlett produced portraits of Crimean War heroes, genre scenes and landscapes. His photographs include the iconic picture of Isambard Kingdom Brunel which was part of a commission by the Illustrated Times to document the construction of the world's largest steamship, the SS Great Eastern.He exhibited at the London Photographic Society and published \"On the Various Methods of Printing Photographic Pictures upon Paper, with Suggestions for Their Preservation\". He worked in partnership with Joseph Cundall at \"The Photographic Institution\" at New Bond Street, London.Howlett made photographic studies for the artist William Powell Frith to assist him on his vast modern panorama painting The Derby Day (1856\u201358; Tate, London) which was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1858.Howlett was commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to photograph the frescoes in the new drawing-room at Buckingham Palace, make copies of the paintings by Raphael and make a series of portraits called 'Crimean Heroes' which was exhibited in 1857 the Photographic Society of London's annual exhibition.Howlett died in 1858, aged 27. His death was apparently due to typhoid (rather than as a result of over-exposure to dangerous chemicals, as was suggested by some at the time, a myth that has continued to this day). The Illustrated Times praised him as \"one of the most skillful photographers of the day\".Prints from Howlett's photographs were published posthumously by his late partners Cundall & Downes under their own name, and by the London Stereoscopic and Photographic Company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of photographers", "response": ["* Robert Howlett (1831\u20131858)"]}, {"page": "SS Great Eastern", "response": ["File:On the deck of SS Great Eastern by Robert Howlett, 1857.jpg|On the deck, 1857", "File:The Great Eastern by Robert Howlett, 1857.jpg|Great Eastern,12 November 1857"]}, {"page": "William Powell Frith", "response": ["He was a member of The Clique, which also included Richard Dadd. The principal influence on his work was the hugely popular domestic subjects painted by Sir David Wilkie. Wilkie's famous painting The Chelsea Pensioners was a spur to the creation of Frith's own most famous compositions. Following the precedent of Wilkie, but also imitating the work of his friend Dickens, Frith created complex multi-figure compositions depicting the full range of the Victorian class system, meeting and interacting in public places. In 'Ramsgate Sands' (also known as 'Life at the Seaside', 1854) he depicted visitors and entertainers at the seaside resort. He followed this with The Derby Day, depicting scenes among the crowd at the race at Epsom Downs, which was based on photographic studies by Robert Howlett.
