It was designed in a brutalist style in 1968 by Neave Brown of Camden Council's Architects Department. Construction work commenced in 1972 and was completed in 1978. It is constructed from site-cast, board-marked white, unpainted reinforced concrete.

However, by the mid-1960s, even before the collapse of Ronan Point, the shortcomings of that method were becoming apparent. Neave Brown believed that ziggurat style terraces, little higher than the terraces they replaced, could provide a better solution.  Vehicular traffic could be restricted to basement level.  Family-sized flats, bright and airy due to the set-back upper floors, could open, via their own \"defensible\" front garden, onto ground floor streets/play areas, whilst the higher levels could be used for smaller flats, each with a private balcony.", "The outcome of the enquiry published in seven reports mainly made \"the apparent failure of the councillors to understand the contractual obligations that they had undertaken\" responsible for the mismanagement and was not successful in blaming the architect as had been hoped by some. Despite there being no findings of a mismanagement on his part, however, being the subject of a public enquiry destroyed Neave Brown's reputation in the UK where he never built again.", "After a continuing career including international town planning and post-graduate teaching, Brown retrained as a fine artist, to which occupation he devoted his retirement.

The design for this (now known as Oakshott Court) was closely related to Highgate New Town but with the terraced blocks in a L-shape formation. Due to pressure of work, delivery of the scheme was given to outside architects (first Roman Halter and then James Gowan) who made a number of changes (including red brick facing instead of concrete) without affecting the fundamentals of the design.
