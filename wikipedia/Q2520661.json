According to Jones himself, his young voice was a tenor voice. He said: \"What you lose on the top end, you gain on the bottom end. I used to be able to hit a top C when I was young now it's a B flat.\" He became the frontman in 1963 for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a Welsh beat group. They soon gained a local following and reputation in South Wales. In 1964, the group recorded several solo tracks with producer Joe Meek, who took them to various record labels, but they had little success. Later that year, Decca producer Peter Sullivan saw Tommy Scott and the Senators performing in a club and directed them to manager Phil Solomon, but the partnership was short-lived."]}, {"page": "Van Morrison", "response": ["Toward the end of the tour the band members became involved in a dispute with their manager, Decca Records' Phil Solomon, over the revenues paid to them; that, coupled with the expiry of their work visas, meant the band returned from America dejected. After two more concerts in Ireland, Them split up. Morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on Astral Weeks, while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated in America.Turner (1993), pages 72\u201373."]}, {"page": "Them (band)", "response": ["Them performed without a routine, fired by the crowd's energy: Morrison later commented that while the band was \"out of our element\" making records... \"The way we did the numbers at the Maritime was more spontaneous, more energetic, more everything, because we were feeding off the crowd.\"Turner, pp. 44\u201345 Morrison ad libbed songs as he performed and \"Gloria\", the classic song he had written at eighteen years old, took shape here and could last up to twenty minutes.Heylin, p. 76 According to Morrison, \"Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel\" but only very rudimentary recordings survive. One fan's recording of \"Turn On Your Love Light\" made its way to Mervyn and Phil Solomon, who contacted Decca Records' Dick Rowe, who then travelled to Belfast to hear Them perform. Rowe and Phil Solomon agreed on a two-year contract with the members of the band then signed up to Solomon. Morrison, at eighteen, had to have his father sign for him. Within a few weeks, the group was taken to England and into Decca's recording studio in West Hampstead for their first recording session.Turner, p. 46.Hinton, pp. 39\u201346.", "Their next single, Big Joe Williams's \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" substituted Andy White on drums, Phil Coulter on second keyboard, and added Jimmy Page on rhythm guitar.  Lead guitar was the work of Billy Harrison. It was released in November with \"Gloria\" as its B-side. In December 1964, Them made their television debut, joining The Rolling Stones, on Ready Steady Go!Turner, p. 51 Their manager, Phil Solomon got the track used as the show's signature tune and within two weeks it was at No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart, eventually peaking at No. 10.Heylin, pp. 100\u2013101", "The band released their first album, The Angry Young Them, in June 1965 (UK) and it appeared in the USA on Parrot Records in July.

Their second album, Them Again, was released in January 1966 in the UK and in April 1966 in the USA."]}, {"page": "Pirate radio in Ireland", "response": ["Sunshine Radio was the first of the so-called Super Pirate radio stations in the Republic of Ireland and commenced broadcasting on 9 September 1980 from studios in the Sands Hotel, Portmarnock, County Dublin. It was the longest operating of the major stations. Sunshine closed at the end of 1988 having achieved the highest ratings of any Dublin radio station to this day. Their head office was in JWT House in Baggot Street in the heart of the city's commercial district. Sunshine Radio was set up by former Radio Caroline men Chris Cary, Robbie Robinson, aka Robbie Dale, and ex-BBC broadcast engineer Jimmy White with some financial support from one of Radio Caroline's partners Phil Solomon. Shortly after making its first test transmissions the station's main aerial tower was vandalised and subsequently collapsed. Cary and Solomon backed out of the venture and sold to Dale only weeks after the station opened. Sunshine Radio started on 531\u00a0kHz (announced as 539 metres) medium wave, adding an FM service a year later. Chris Cary went on to start Radio Nova in the following year, 1981, with studios in Herbert Street, Dublin.  Nova was the first major Irish pirate to commence with FM, on 88.1\u00a0MHz (it ended up on 102.7\u00a0MHz). The station added an AM frequency at a later stage which varied between 819\u00a0kHz, 828\u00a0kHz, 846\u00a0kHz and 738\u00a0kHz. After the success of Radio Nova on FM, Robbie Robinson broadcast Sunshine at high power on 101\u00a0MHz, and renamed the station Sunshine 101. Nova ran until 1986 when Chris Cary closed the station following a dispute with the National Union of Journalists. Other stations came on air like Q102 some claiming a Cary connection like NRG 103 (some thought that \"NRG\" was an abbreviation for \"Nova Radio Group\"), but the name sounded like Energy 103 and Power FM, but none were able to come near to the Nova or Sunshine success. Sunshine 101 dominated the Dublin radio market until it closed down at the end of December 1988 in compliance with the new Broadcasting & Wireless Telegraphy act, which had come into effect at midnight on 31 December that year. Many of the present-day stars of Irish broadcasting are proud to acknowledge their early days as part of the teams to come out of Sunshine and Nova."]}, {"page": "Ronan O'Rahilly", "response": ["In 1966, O'Rahilly gave businessman Phil Solomon a share in Radio Caroline, and with him set up Major Minor Records, whose acts including The Dubliners and David McWilliams were then promoted by the station.

It had a distribution deal with Decca Records. Artists on the label included the Dubliners and Johnny Nash.", "Phil Solomon was also co-director of Radio Caroline in the mid-1960s. In August 1967, the Wilson government outlawed pirate radio and, although Radio Caroline continued, it began to heavily promote records from the Major Minor label. Caroline's DJs were unhappy with the type of music they were being forced to play and it is doubtful that much of the revenue from the record label actually went back into the radio station. In March 1968, the two Caroline ships were silenced when they were seized by creditors."]}, {"page": "David McWilliams (musician)", "response": ["He recorded a demo of some of his own songs, which was heard by music industry entrepreneur Phil Solomon, who had previously managed The Bachelors and Van Morrison's band Them and also had close business ties with Ronan O'Rahilly's pirate radio station Radio Caroline.[ Biography at Allmusic.com.] Accessed 15 January 2010 Solomon convinced close friend and well established songwriter Dominic Behan to take McWilliams under his wing to the point that McWilliams moved into the Behan family home in West London, an environment within which he was able to focus on songwriting; the impact of Behan's influence is difficult to determine but, it can be seen that McWilliams' live performances became much more self-assured, a key to future success. Following a period of five months in Behan's household, Solomon was able to negotiate a contract with CBS Records, which released his first, unsuccessful single \"God and My Country\" in 1966, before signing McWilliams to his own new Major Minor label. McWilliams and Behan were to remain close friends until the death of Dominic Behan in 1989."]}, {"page": "Here Comes the Night", "response": ["According to Phil Coulter the band had intended this song to be the follow-up to \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" but Decca rush-released a recording of the song by Lulu in November 1964. The band members of Them were said to be bitterly disappointed by this decision made by Decca and Phil Solomon. Phil Coulter remarked: \"They bitched to me a lot but they wouldn't dare to have said anything to Solomon.\" The band was said to have a \"certain grim satisfaction\" as Lulu's recording reached No. 50 and then dropped off the charts."]}, {"page": "Van Morrison: No Surrender", "response": ["The band Them was signed by Phil Solomon, who contracted producer Bert Berns to work with the group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist.

I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing. We were really into the blues... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that shit.\"", "The group were not sociable with reporters, and according to the book Morrison's drinking habits made him reclusive. \"I regret that we couldn't have controlled Morrison better... I think he would have been big if he'd been straightened out at the beginning of his career,\" comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. \"He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke.
