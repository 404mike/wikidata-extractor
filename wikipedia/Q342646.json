He wrote on the history of analytic philosophy, notably as an interpreter of Frege, and made original contributions particularly in the philosophies of mathematics, logic, language and metaphysics. He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between realism and anti-realism, a term he helped to popularize. He devised the Quota Borda system of proportional voting, based on the Borda count. In mathematical logic, he developed an intermediate logic, already studied by Kurt G\u00f6del: the G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anti-realism", "response": ["In analytic philosophy, anti-realism is a position which encompasses many varieties such as metaphysical, mathematical, semantic, scientific, moral and epistemic. The term was first articulated by British philosopher Michael Dummett in an argument against a form of realism Dummett saw as 'colorless reductionism'.Realism (1963) p. 145", "The term \"anti-realism\" was introduced by Michael Dummett in his 1982 paper \"Realism\" in order to re-examine a number of classical philosophical disputes, involving such doctrines as nominalism, Platonic realism, idealism and phenomenalism. The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in portraying these disputes as analogous to the dispute between intuitionism and Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics."]}, {"page": "December 27", "response": ["*  2011   \u2013 Michael Dummett, English soldier, philosopher, and academic (b. 1925)"]}, {"page": "Empiricism", "response": ["In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists\u2014at least before the 1930s\u2014any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of phenomenalism in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics.  That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called protocol sentences, for example, \"X at location Y and at time T observes such and such\".Rescher, Nicholas (1985), The Heritage of Logical Positivism, University Press of America, Lanham, MD.  The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic\u2013synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as Nelson Goodman, W.V. Quine, Hilary Putnam, Karl Popper, and Richard Rorty.  By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant among contemporary analytic philosophers such as Michael Dummett and other anti-realists."]}]}}
