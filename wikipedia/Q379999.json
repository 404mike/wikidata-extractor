Haldane, who suggested that the prior probability representing complete uncertainty should be proportional to p\u22121(1\u2212p)\u22121. The function p\u22121(1\u2212p)\u22121 can be viewed as the limit of the numerator of the beta distribution as both shape parameters approach zero: \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2192 0. The Beta function (in the denominator of the beta distribution) approaches infinity, for both parameters approaching zero, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2192 0. Therefore, p\u22121(1\u2212p)\u22121 divided by the Beta function approaches a 2-point Bernoulli distribution with equal probability 1/2 at each end, at 0 and 1, and nothing in between, as \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2192 0. A coin-toss: one face of the coin being at 0 and the other face being at 1.  The Haldane prior probability distribution Beta(0,0) is an \"improper prior\" because its integration (from 0 to 1) fails to strictly converge to 1 due to the singularities at each end. However, this is not an issue for computing posterior probabilities unless the sample size is very small.  Furthermore, Zellner points out that on the log-odds scale, (the logit transformation ln(p/1\u2212p)), the Haldane prior is the uniformly flat prior. The fact that a uniform prior probability on the logit transformed variable ln(p/1\u2212p) (with domain (-\u221e, \u221e)) is equivalent to the Haldane prior on the domain [0, 1] was pointed out by Harold Jeffreys in the first edition (1939) of his book Theory of Probability ( p.\u00a0123).  Jeffreys writes \"Certainly if we take the Bayes-Laplace rule right up to the extremes we are led to results that do not correspond to anybody's way of thinking. The (Haldane) rule dx/(x(1\u2212x)) goes too far the other way.  It would lead to the conclusion that if a sample is of one type with respect to some property there is a probability 1 that the whole population is of that type.\"  The fact that \"uniform\" depends on the parametrization, led Jeffreys to seek a form of prior that would be invariant under different parametrizations.", "Harold Jeffreys proposed to use an uninformative prior probability measure that should be invariant under reparameterization: proportional to the square root of the determinant of Fisher's information matrix.  For the Bernoulli distribution, this can be shown as follows: for a coin that is \"heads\" with probability p \u2208 [0, 1] and is \"tails\" with probability 1 \u2212 p, for a given (H,T) \u2208 {(0,1), (1,0)} the probability is pH(1 \u2212 p)T.  Since T = 1 \u2212 H, the Bernoulli distribution is pH(1 \u2212 p)1 \u2212 H.
