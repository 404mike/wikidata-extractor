The civil case was judged on the balance of probabilities and did not need corroboration of evidence, unlike in a Scottish criminal case. Goodwillie left his club, Plymouth Argyle, soon after the case concluded. A club statement said that Goodwillie had asked to leave as he was considering an appeal.

The following day, Levein confirmed Grant Smith's contract would not be renewed but Sean Dillon's move from Shelbourne was eventually completed, with the Irish full back arriving on 11 January. Prior to this, a flu epidemic had seen the Scottish Cup game against St Mirren postponed. The after-effects may have been present as United slumped to a 5\u20130 defeat at Ibrox, with Daly and Dillon both making debuts. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that Inverness captain Darren Dods had signed a pre-contract agreement to join in the summer, ending a lengthy pursuit for him that had been started by former manager Craig Brewster some months previously. The re-arranged cup match against St Mirren was full of excitement, with United throwing away a two-goal lead before David Robertson secured the win with an injury-time winner. United lost a third consecutive league match, going down 1\u20130 at Rugby Park, with David McCracken \u2013 who had earlier been told he would be leaving in the summer \u2013 absent.

The following week, David Robertson's goal earned a 1\u20131 draw at home to Inverness, although it later transpired Jon Daly's knee injury was posterior cruciate ligament damage and would rule him out for several months. On the same day, United's proposed pre-season fixture with Barcelona was confirmed, before St Mirren eased their relegation worries with a 2\u20130 weekend win at Tannadice. The penultimate match of the season saw a third straight loss for United, going down 2\u20130 at Falkirk; earlier in the week, Derek Stillie confirmed he would leave the club at the end of the season to pursue an English law career. Collin Samuel was not far behind, although due to the club deciding not to offer a new contract. The Falkirk defeat also saw another d\u00e9but for a youngster with Johnny Russell making a late substitute appearance. The season finished with a 0\u20130 home draw against Motherwell.
