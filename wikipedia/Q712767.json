This gave the scheme credibility. They developed their teaching skills by coaching in schools and then moved into part-time coaching positions in junior clubs. He gathered around him a cadre of young FA staff coaches: men like Bill Nicholson, Don Howe, Alan Brown, Ron Greenwood, Dave Sexton, Malcolm Allison, Joe Mercer, Vic Buckingham, Jimmy Hill and Bobby Robson. Over time a new breed of managers emerged in the League clubs and began to change attitudes to coaching."]}, {"page": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.", "response": ["===Bill Nicholson and the glory years (1958\u20131974)===", "Bill Nicholson took over as manager in October 1958. He became the club's most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the Double in 1961, the FA Cup in 1962 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1963. Nicholson signed Dave Mackay and John White in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and Jimmy Greaves in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the top tier of English football.", "There are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as \"Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur\". The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the Double in 1960\u201361, and the club entered the European Cup for the first time. Their first opponents were G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4\u20132 reverse. Tottenham's tough tackling prompted the Polish press to describe them as \"they were no angels\". These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into togas, sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing biblical-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of \"Glory Glory Hallelujah\", which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds. The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8\u20131. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: ", "* 1958  Bill Nicholson", "*  Bill Nicholson"]}, {"page": "Offside (association football)", "response": ["Determining whether a player is \"involved in active play\" can be complex. The quote, \"If he's not interfering with play, what's he doing on the pitch?\" has been attributed to Bill Nicholson and Danny Blanchflower.  In an effort to avoid such criticisms, which were based on the fact that phrases such as \"interfering with play\", \"interfering with an opponent\", and \"gaining an advantage\" were not clearly defined, FIFA issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003; and these were incorporated into Law 11 in July 2005. The new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely, but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent. In response to these requests, IFAB circular 3 was issued in 2015 to provide additional guidance on the criteria for interfering with an opponent. This additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law, and forms the last 3 conditions under the heading \"Interfering with an opponent\" as shown above. The circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save, in the context of a ball that has \"been deliberately saved by any opponent.\""]}, {"page": "Jimmy Greaves", "response": ["After protracted negotiations, Bill Nicholson signed Greaves for Tottenham Hotspur in December 1961 for \u00a399,999\u00a0\u2013 the unusual fee was intended to relieve Greaves of the pressure of being the first \u00a3100,000 player in British football. He joined Spurs just after they became the first club in England to complete the First Division and FA Cup double during the 20th century. He played his first game in a Spurs shirt for the reserve team on 9 December 1961, and scored twice in a 4\u20131 win over Plymouth Argyle Reserves at Home Park. He scored a hat-trick on his first team debut, including a flying scissor kick, in a 5\u20132 win over Blackpool at White Hart Lane. He went on to feature against Benfica in the semi-finals of the European Cup; in the first leg at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz he had a goal disallowed for offside, and another disallowed in the return fixture also for offside. He played in all seven games of the club's FA Cup run, scoring nine goals in the competition as they beat Birmingham City (after a replay), Plymouth Argyle, West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa and Manchester United to reach the 1962 FA Cup Final against Burnley at Wembley. Greaves opened the scoring against Burnley on 3 minutes when he hit a low shot past goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw from a tight angle, and Spurs went on to win the game 3\u20131. They finished the league in third place in 1961\u201362, four points behind champions Ipswich Town.", "Manager Bill Nicholson and his assistant Eddie Baily then began a period of transition at White Hart Lane\u00a0\u2013 Danny Blanchflower aged 38 retired in 1964 and John White was killed by a lightning strike. Dave Mackay remained until 1968 and Greaves remained a consistent goalscorer. In the 1963\u201364 season Greaves scored hat-tricks in victories over Nottingham Forest, Blackpool, Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers. Spurs finished in fourth place, six points behind champions Liverpool, and exited the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup at the opening stages. Greaves scored 35 goals in 41 league games to again finish as the division's top scorer. Strike partner Bobby Smith left the club in the summer, though Greaves felt the partnership he went on to form with new signing Alan Gilzean was even more effective."]}, {"page": "Newport County A.F.C.", "response": ["Billy Lucas had the first of three spells as Newport County manager from 1953 to 1961.

In the 1958\u201359 FA Cup County faced Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round. The game was played in heavy snow away at White Hart Lane, and although County lost 4\u20131 their goal came from an incredible 35-yard effort by defender Ken Hollyman. This made the score-line 1\u20132, giving County the hope that they could force an upset upon Bill Nicholson's men (who were double winners a year later). However, two late goals for Tottenham ended County's hopes of pulling off a shock result.
