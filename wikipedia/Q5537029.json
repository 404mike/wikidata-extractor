After seeing the level, which reminded him of winter sports, the music was rewritten from scratch to be upbeat. In keeping with the game's visuals and themes, the music included vocal contributions from West End singers. On the recommendation of composer Youki Yamamoto, singer Laura Pitt-Pulford was brought on board along with many associated singers. Yamazaki described Pitt-Pulford as \"the perfect match\" due to her style and previous experience recording vocals for the anime adaptation of Dr. Stone. Lead vocals were performed by Pitt-Pulford and George Blagden. The vocals used the game's made-up language to maintain the mysterious atmosphere. English versions were recorded and included as a bonus for players who collected all Balan Statues in a level.
