It was based on the Mark 3 Ford Fiesta platform, but with a completely different exterior design. The design borrowed a lot from Ghia's \"Saetta\" show car, a roadster designed by Filippo Sapino. The Ka evolved from concept vehicles to production with minor changes. The large, one piece, moulded bumpers and wheel arches made the vehicle more durable and easier to repair. The vehicle was manufactured on the existing Fiesta production line in Almussafes, Valencia, minimising new model investment costs. The Chief Program Engineer was Kevin O\u2019Neill.
