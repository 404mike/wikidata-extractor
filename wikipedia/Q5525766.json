He also brought in three players on free transfers: Tommy Gore (Bury), Gary Pollard (Chesterfield), and Chris Pearce (Rochdale). The club reported record season ticket sales, however several players refused to sign new contracts. As a result, Barry Siddall, Russell Bromage, Geoff Hunter, and Terry Armstrong remained on weekly contracts.", "On the financial side, a \u00a350,601 profit was recorded with donations from the Development Fund of \u00a3146,177 and an income of \u00a373,023 from the open market rents. Wages had been cut back to \u00a3310,542, whilst gate receipts rose to \u00a3180,504. The club's shirt sponsors were PMT. Steve Fox left for Chester City and Gary Pollard joined Mansfield Town. However Mark Bright signed with Leicester City against Rudge's wishes, and a tribunal handed Vale \u00a333,333 and top-up clauses. O'Keefe also requested a transfer, as he felt he would receive no further international caps playing in the fourth tier. Mick Cullerton, then Vale's commercial manager, later claimed that vast wage disparities in the squad caused discontent and reduced club morale.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Gary Pollard", "| June 1983 || DF ||  || Gary Pollard || Chesterfield || Free transfer || ", "| July 1984 || DF ||  || Gary Pollard || Mansfield Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1987 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["||DF ||12||Gary Pollard || "]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Gary Pollard"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Gary Pollard"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Gary Pollard"]}, {"page": "Pollard, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Pollard"]}]}}
