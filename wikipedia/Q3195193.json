Macksey was commissioned in the Royal Armoured Corps and served during the Second World War (earning a Military Cross under the command of Percy Hobart). Macksey later wrote a biography of Hobart. Macksey gained a permanent commission in 1946, was transferred to the Royal Tank Regiment in 1947, reached the rank of major in 1957 and retired from the Army in 1968.Amongst many other books, Macksey wrote two volumes of alternate history, one, entitled Invasion, dealt with a successful invasion of England by Germany in 1940 and the other describing a NATO\u2013Warsaw Pact clash in the late 1980s.
