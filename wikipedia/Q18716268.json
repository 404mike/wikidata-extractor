He was of an old Kent family (Hasted, History of Kent, iii. 109), being the eldest son of Commodore William Boys, R.N., lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital (c.1700\u20131774), by his wife, Elizabeth Pearson of Deal (Gent. Mag. lxxiii. pt. i. 421-3). About 1755 he was a surgeon at Sandwich, Kent, where he was noted for his untiring explorations of Richborough Castle, for skill in deciphering ancient manuscripts and inscriptions, for his zeal in collecting antiquities connected with Sandwich, and for his studies in astronomy, natural history, and mathematics. In 1759 he married Elizabeth Wise, a daughter of Henry Wise, one of the Sandwich jurats (ibid.), and by her he had two children. In 1761 he was elected jurat, acting with his wife's father. In the same year, 1761, she died, and in the next year, 1762, he married Jane Fuller, coheiress of her uncle, one John Paramor of Statenborough (ibid.) In 1767 Boys was mayor of Sandwich. In 1774 his father died at Greenwich (Nichols, Lit. Anecd. ix. 24 n.)", "In 1787 Boys published an account of the survivors of the Luxborough Galley, a case of cannibalism, in which his father (Commodore Boys) had been one of the men compelled to resort to this horrible means of preserving life. Boys had a series of pictures hung up in his parlour portraying the whole of the terrible circumstances (Pennant, in his Journey from London to the Isle of Wight). Of this Account, as a separate publication, there is now no trace; but it appears in full in a history of Greenwich Hospital;History of Greenwich Hospital, by John Cooke and John Maule, 1789, pp. 110 et seq. six small paintings that were in the council room of the hospital (presumably replicas of those seen by Pennant in the possession of William Boys) represent this passage, they are now held in the hospital's collection at the National Maritime Museum,"]}, {"page": "Luxborough Galley", "response": ["The disastrous journey had seen one third of the human cargo, 600 African slaves, die from smallpox before they were delivered.

The testimony of William Boys is often referred to in later notices; he was a 24-year-old second mate on the voyage, having already served with the Royal Navy for ten years.", "The Luxboroughs crew were adrift for two weeks, and their number was reduced to twelve before their rescue by fishermen off the coast of Newfoundland. The captain died the next day. They were tended to by their rescuers before setting out for a major port. Only five men reached this destination; one man went to New England and the rest reached London on 14 October. Of the few survivors, William Boys survived to the age of 74; the surgeon, Scrimsour, to 80; and George Mould died at Greenwich Hospital aged 82.", "The gruesome details of the survivors of the Luxborough Galley appeared in notices in newspapers.
