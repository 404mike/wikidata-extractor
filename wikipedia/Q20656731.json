Among his fellow graduates were Charles Harington and Alan Brown. In 1931, the regiment was posted to India. He was promoted lieutenant in 1933. Despite his background he seems not to have been entirely comfortable with the prevailing social climate of the Raj. He preferred rugby to polo, and having already gained fluency in German and French he added Urdu and some Bengali. In 1934 he became a Military Intelligence officer in the Indian Army, with the local rank of captain, and was seconded to the Indian Police. At this time the Indian independence movement was gaining ground, and Bengal was particularly affected. Hunt even worked undercover, gathering intelligence in Chittagong while dressed in local clothing. He returned to his regiment in 1935, having been awarded the Indian Police Medal."]}, {"page": "Alan Brown", "response": ["Alan Brown may refer to:", "* Alan Brown (Australian politician) (born 1946), Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "* Alan Brown (Scottish politician) (born 1970), Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilmarnock and Loudoun since 2015", "* Alan Brown, British tennis player in the 1930s, see 1931 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles", "* Alan Brown (footballer, born 1914) (1914\u20131996), English football player and manager", "* Alan Brown (racing driver) (1919\u20132004), British Formula 1 racing driver", "* Alan Brown (cricketer, born 1933) (1933\u20132013), English cricketer", "* Alan Brown (cricketer, born 1935), English cricketer", "* Alan Brown (footballer, born 1937) (1937\u20132016), English football forward (Brighton & Hove Albion, Exeter City)", "* Alan Brown (cricketer, born 1957), English cricketer", "* Alan Brown (footballer, born 1959), English football forward (Sunderland, Newcastle United, Shrewsbury Town, Doncaster Rovers)", "* Alan Brown (rugby union) (born 1980), Scottish rugby union player", "* Alan Brown (British Army officer) (1909\u20131971), British Army brigadier", "* Alan Brown (police officer), British police officer", "* Alan Brown (filmmaker), American director and author", "* Alan Browne (footballer) (born 1995), Irish footballer", "* Alan Browne (born 1974), Irish hurler"]}]}}
