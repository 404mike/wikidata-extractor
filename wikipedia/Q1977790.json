At 17 he spent a year as a volunteer teacher in the jungles of Borneo, working with the children of head-hunters, after which he studied history and political science at Victoria University of Wellington, and journalism at the Wellington Polytechnic. He returned to Britain overland across Asia in 1973, traveling through Sri Lanka, Kashmir, Afghanistan and Iran, and worked for Shelter, the British housing charity, before joining the Times Educational Supplement, from which base he also wrote features for The Times.\nAfter five years as a reporter and program anchor for BBC Radio, Gavin began in 1980 making films for BBC Television\u2019s Newsnight, covering literary as well as political subjects; among his interviewees, J.B. Priestley, Christopher Isherwood, Iris Murdoch and John Fowles. He then made documentaries on science and culture for series such as Horizon and Man Alive before joining Channel 4 News, for which he made films until 1990.\nFollowing the death of Maurice Macmillan in 1984, son of the former British Prime Minister and MP for Surrey South West Harold Macmillan, Gavin Scott was selected and stood as a Liberal here at the Parliamentary Byelection for the Liberal/SDP Alliance  and came within 2,600 votes of taking the seat from the Conservative candidate Virginia Bottomley who went on to serve in John Major's cabinet.\nIt was during this time that he started writing novels, including Hot Pursuit, about a Russian satellite that crashed in New Zealand, and A Flight of Lies, about the hunt for the bones of Peking Man. He has recently written a Dickensian historical novel set in the nineteenth century, The Adventures of Toby Wey. He also had a stint at ITN as a reporter/newsreader in the late 1980s. \nGavin is also a sculptor, creating shadow boxes similar to those of Joseph Cornell, using mass-produced toys as his medium.
