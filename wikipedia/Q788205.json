The position was first offered to Edward Blake, a renowned Ontario lawyer and Liberal politician. However, he declined the offer and instead accepted a post in government as the Minister of Justice. William Buell Richards, the chief justice of Ontario and formerly the attorney-general of Canada West, was ultimately appointed as Chief Justice. Samuel Henry Strong, who helped draft the 1869 proposal and was a judge on the Ontario Supreme Court, filled the other seat for Ontario. The Quebec positions were filled by T\u00e9l\u00e9sphore Fournier, the Minister of Justice who introduced the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, 1875, and Jean-Thomas Taschereau, a judge of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench. The remaining two seats went to William Johnston Ritchie, chief justice of New Brunswick, and William Alexander Henry, a former Nova Scotia MLA who lost his seat for his role as a Father of Confederation. The average age of the first six members of the Court was fifty-seven years, which would in fact be one of the youngest benches in the history of the Court."]}, {"page": "List of justices of the Supreme Court of Canada", "response": ["| Samuel Henry Strong"]}, {"page": "List of justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by court composition", "response": ["The Strong  Court era, under the leadership of Samuel Henry Strong, lasted from December 13, 1892 \u2013 November 18, 1902.
