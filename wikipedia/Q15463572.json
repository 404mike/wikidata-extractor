In his autobiography, the actor recognised the decade as being an important era of his career. It started with a major role in Anton Chekhov's Ivanov in 1950. The production took place at the Arts Theatre in Cambridge and excited audiences because of its 25-year absence from the English stage. The writer T. C. Worsley was impressed by Hordern's performance and wrote: \"Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully than Mr Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level of expectation all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the right kind of support.\"T. C. Worsley; quoted in Hordern, pp. 88\u201389. The title character in Macbeth, directed by Alec Clunes, was Hordern's next engagement. Critics wrote of their dislike of Clunes's version, but the theatre reviewer Audrey Williamson singled out Hordern's performance as being \"deeply moving\".Audrey Williamson; quoted in Hordern, p. 89."]}, {"page": "Kurt Hahn", "response": ["In 1934, through his lectures in London to the New Education Fellowship, Hahn met the educationalist T. C. Worsley and persuaded him to spend a summer term at the newly founded Gordonstoun in the capacity of consultant.

The Audience Research Report was higher than usual, with praise for the production and atmosphere; the primary complaint was the lack of Daleks, and some viewers felt it was too gruesome for children. The Review Board described the third episode as \"outstanding\". The following week, executives of the Board felt that the show's quality was consistently high. Adam indicated that Director-General Hugh Greene was eager to see the Daleks return in future stories. T. C. Worsley of the Financial Times praised the serial for creating a universal image for the Daleks. On 27 May 1965, critic Frederick Laws wrote that he had banned his children from watching Doctor Who due to the ending of the serial's first episode."]}, {"page": "Esmond Romilly", "response": ["Wellington College had been founded by national subscription as a memorial to the first Duke, who had died in 1852. It had opened in 1859, primarily as a military orphanage for the sons of deceased officers, but by the 1920s had evolved into a public school of a highly reactionary character. T. C. Worsley, who taught there in the early 1930s, described it as \"philistine to a degree almost unimaginable in a great school\", and \"[I]n every possible way ... thirty, forty, fifty years behind the times\". Its style was of absolute conformity, based on what Kevin Ingram, Esmond's biographer, calls a \"doctrine of suppression\"; a tight curriculum that accounted for every moment of the boys' time, and a \"dormitory\" system that placed boys in small exclusive units that kept them apart from the rest of the school in every activity outside the classroom. Esmond would later write of his \"hatred\" at seeing \"the same faces opposite one every day ... always there was the same monotonous conversation\"."]}, {"page": "Flannelled Fool", "response": ["Flannelled Fool: A Slice of a Life in the Thirties is an autobiography by T.
