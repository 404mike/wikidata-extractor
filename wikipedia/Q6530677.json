He predicted that to lead to Chamberlain offering to return to Germany its former African colonies that were now ruled by Britain. In response, Baron Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker, the State Secretary of the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt, wrote back to Dirksen that the German media campaign hostile to British rearmament \"was instigated on the direct orders of the Foreign Minister\". Schorske noted that a \"striking\" aspect of the line of Anglo-German negotiations that Dirksen wanted to pursue in October 1938 was that reflected Chamberlain's priorities, such as disarmament and the possible return of the former German colonies in Africa, did not reflect Hitler's priorities, such as Czecho-Slovakia (the new name of Czechoslovakia since October 1938), the Memelland and Poland. In the last two weekends of October 1938, Dirksen made visits to the English countryside to meet Sir Samuel Hoare and Leslie Burgin for talks on an Anglo-German d\u00e9tente.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 86\u201387. Dirksen reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that both Hoare and Burgin wanted talks about an Anglo-German treaty to end the arms race; another treaty to \"humanise\" air war with bombing of cities and chemical weapons to be banned; a colonial settlement to return the former German colonies in Africa in exchanges for promises of no war in Europe and a British \"guarantee\" to protect Germany from the Soviet Union.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 87. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote: \"This last is often cited by Soviet historians as proof of their thesis that the Cabinet was obsessed with the urge to provoke a German-Soviet war. Taken in its proper context, Hoare's ill-chosen remarks made it clear that the offer of a guarantee was intended to disarm any German arguments that Soviet strength in the air necessitated the maintenance of a large German Luftwaffe\"."]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Leslie Burgin, Liberal and Liberal National MP 1929\u201345, Minister of Transport, 1937\u201339, Minister of Supply, 1939\u201340."]}, {"page": "Christ's College, Finchley", "response": ["* Leslie Burgin, Liberal MP for Luton from 1929\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Leslie Burgin "]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade", "response": ["* 1931\u20131937 Leslie Burgin"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Leslie Burgin"]}, {"page": "Roads in the United Kingdom", "response": ["For the first time since the Roman occupation, the Ministry of Transport took direct control of the core road network through the Trunk Roads Act 1936.

On 20 October 1921, The Times reported that the 'St. Pancras Borough Council last night decided, by 45 votes to three, to adhere to their decision dismissing Dr. Gladys Miall-Smith from her appointment as assistant medical officer for maternity.'  The Medical Woman's Journal wrote:It appears that the council's decision is mainly based on the theory that, because there is widespread unemployment, married women whose husbands are able to support them should not compete in the labor market. This argument is ancient and musty and in respects an economic fallacy. The belief is that people with private means ought not to work because they \"take the bread out of the mouth\" of those who are compelled to work for a living... It is instructive to note that five women councillors attended the meeting, but only two voted in favour of the woman doctor.The Women's Freedom League organised a protest meeting against the dismissal, held at the Working Men's College, with speakers including Louise McIlroy, Winifred Cullis, Helena Normanton, Agnes Dawson, and Leslie Burgin. The following year, St. Pancras appointed Dr. Stella Churchill to replace Miall-Smith. Helena Normanton, writing to The Woman's Leader, criticised this decision, noting that in hiring a widow 'St. Pancras has now obtained precisely what it wanted all along - a woman celibate.' Normanton believed that 'as long as Dr. Miall-Smith's shameful dismissal stands unredressed and unvindicated, so long do all women stand rebuked and humiliated; and the marriage state dishonoured.'
