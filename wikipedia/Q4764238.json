Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, describes Valdai as \"a swanky high-level conference put on by the Russian elite.\" Drezner describes Valdai as \"the highest-profile Russian equivalent to Davos\" and writes that the chief value to attendees is the ability to determine the official line of the Russian government, although attendance also risks \"greater legitimacy on a government that has been accused of some less-than-legitimate activities as of late.\" Nikolay Petrov of the Carnegie Moscow Center identified Valdai as \"a project used as blatant propaganda by the Kremlin\" while Russian sociologist Lilia Shevtsova criticized the Valdai conferences in an article entitled \"Putin's Useful Idiots.\" Marcel H. Van Herpen identifies Valdai as a soft power effort by the Kremlin in service of Russian foreign policy goals, with Russian leadership using the conference in a bid to (1) gain goodwill among Western intellectuals, (2) create networking opportunities between Russian and Western elites, and (3) \"create a testing ground for the Kremlin's foreign policy initiatives.\" Angus Roxburgh notes that RIA Novosti was important to the establishment of Valdai during Putin's second term, and that the conference plays a key role in the Russian government's effort to burnish Putin's image and influence outsiders."]}]}}
