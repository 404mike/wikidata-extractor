He was also known as Waterloo Clark, because of the sketches he made on the field directly after the Battle of Waterloo.Clark exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1801 and 1832. He was the author of A practical essay on the art of Colouring and Painting Landscapes, with illustrations, published in 1807, and A practical Illustration of Gilpin's Day, with thirty colour plates, based on monochrome studies representing different times of day by William Gilpin, in 1824.He died in Edinburgh in 1863.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clark's anemonefish", "response": ["The specific name and the common name both honour the Scottish engraver John Heaviside Clark (1771\u20131836) who provided illustrations for Bennett's A Selection from the most remarkable and interesting Fishes found on the Coast of Ceylon, from drawings made in the Southern part of that Island."]}, {"page": "William Gilpin (priest)", "response": ["Although Gilpin sometimes commented on designed landscapes, the picturesque remained for him an essential set of rules for depicting nature. It was left to others, notably Richard Payne Knight, Uvedale Price and Thomas Johnes, to develop Gilpin's ideas into more comprehensive theories of the picturesque and apply these more generally to landscape design and architecture. Ultimately, these grand theories of wild natural beauty gave way to the tamer, more commercialised picturesque of the mid-19th century, though Gilpin's works remained popular and several new editions appeared with additions by John Heaviside Clark."]}, {"page": "Heaviside (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Heaviside Clark (c. 1771\u20131836), Scottish artist"]}, {"page": "John Clark", "response": ["*John Heaviside Clark (c. 1771\u20131836), Scottish engraver and painter"]}, {"page": "1771 in art", "response": ["** John Heaviside Clark, Scottish aquatint engraver and painter of seascapes and landscapes (died 1863)"]}, {"page": "John H.
