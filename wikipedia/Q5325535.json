He began working as a teacher in St. Malachy's High School in 1968, serving as Vice Principal from 1986\u20131998 and over-seeing the school's transition to A-levels. Eamon has been a community leader in the Castlewellan and Newcastle area since the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement. In 1977 he was elected to Down District Council for the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and has now served on the Council for 34 years.\nAt the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election, O'Neill was elected in South Down.  However, he narrowly lost his seat at the 2003 election and failed to regain it at the 2011 elections. Eamon was later Chair of Down District Council.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Eamon O'Neill", "|Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "South Down (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| Eamon O'Neill(SDLP)"]}, {"page": "Tom Spilsbury", "response": ["Spilsbury has often been called on as a Doctor Who expert, appearing on BBC News and BBC Breakfast on several occasions. He was called on to comment on the departure of Matt Smith by BBC News on 1 June 2013, where he was asked about the controversial 'regeneration limit' of only 13 Doctors being allowed. Spilsbury commented that the writers had \"just made that up,\" and so the writers could \"make up something else.\" He later appeared in a discussion on BBC Breakfast over the identity of the new Doctor, revealed on 4 August 2013. When asked by presenter Naga Munchetty who he thought might be in the frame, Spilsbury praised names such as Olivia Colman. He also quipped that the reveal of a new Doctor was \"like the Royal baby for sci-fi fans,\" with all the same speculation as to whether it would be a boy or a girl. When pushed who he thought would be cast, Spilsbury remained on the fence, confirming that he was as in the dark over the new Doctor's identity as everyone else. He stated that he wouldn't be surprised if a woman was cast in the role in the future, but doubted it would happen on this occasion. The same day he was the special guest on the BBC Radio Manchester show hosted by Eamon O'Neill and Jimmy Wagg, where they discussed the arrival of the new Doctor, and Tom suggested that he might be keeping it secret because he himself had taken the job!  Later that evening, Peter Capaldi was revealed as the Twelfth Doctor. The next morning, Spilsbury was widely quoted saying that Capaldi \"was brilliant already.\" A year later, when Capaldi made his full d\u00e9but as the Doctor in August 2014, Spilsbury returned to BBC Breakfast to give his full verdict, giving the new Doctor a thumbs up. BBC Radio Wales interviewed Spilsbury about the imminent series 10 of Doctor Who on 30 March 2017."]}, {"page": "Eamonn O'Neill (Northern Ireland politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "2005 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "2001 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "1997 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "1993 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "1989 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "1985 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "1981 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "1977 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "Eamon O'Neill (Northern Ireland politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "Eamon O'Neill (Northern Irish politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "2011 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Eamon O'Neill"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname O'Neill", "response": ["*Eamon O'Neill (born 1944), Northern Irish nationalist politician in Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "Eamon O'Neill (SDLP politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eamon O'Neill"]}]}}
