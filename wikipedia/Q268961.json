This leads to combinatorial game theory as developed by John Horton Conway. An alternative is using a rule that if the result of a move is an immediate win for A it is assigned positive infinity and if it is an immediate win for B, negative infinity. The value to A of any other move is the maximum of the values resulting from each of B's possible replies. For this reason, A is called the maximizing player and B is called the minimizing player, hence the name minimax algorithm. The above algorithm will assign a value of positive or negative infinity to any position since the value of every position will be the value of some final winning or losing position.  Often this is generally only possible at the very end of complicated games such as chess or go, since it is not computationally feasible to look ahead as far as the completion of the game, except towards the end, and instead, positions are given finite values as estimates of the degree of belief that they will lead to a win for one player or another."]}, {"page": "Martin Gardner", "response": ["His writing was credited as both broad and deep.BBC News (2014):  It went a lot further than puzzles\u2014there was substance, depth and a fair share of mystery and wonder in the topics he wrote about.BBC News (2014):  Penrose tiles are a good example of just how 'nontrivial' the consequences of his puzzle column could be. The materials scientist Dan Shechtman actually won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2011 'for the discovery of quasicrystals'\u2014three-dimensional Penrose tiles\u2014in some aluminium-manganese alloys.Hofstadter (2010):  His approach and his ways of combining ideas are truly unique and truly creative, and, if I dare say so, what Martin Gardner has done is of far greater originality than work that has won many people Nobel Prizes. Noam Chomsky once wrote, \"Martin Gardner's contribution to contemporary intellectual culture is unique\u2014in its range, its insight, and understanding of hard questions that matter.\"Brown (2010)MacTutor: Gardner has produced a number of mathematical papers, written with leading mathematicians. Gardner repeatedly alerted the public (and other mathematicians) to recent discoveries in mathematics\u2013recreational and otherwise. In addition to introducing many first-rate puzzles and topics such as Penrose tilesKullman (1997): Martin Gardner, in his \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American presented \"for the first time\" a description of the Penrose tiles, including many of Conway's results concerning them. and Conway's Game of Life,MAA FOCUS\u00a0(2010): \"Another milestone was in late 1970, when Martin\u2019s column introduced the world to John Horton Conway\u2019s Game of Life\"\u2013John Derbyshire he was equally adept at writing columns about traditional mathematical topics such as knot theory, Fibonacci numbers, Pascal's triangle, the M\u00f6bius strip, transfinite numbers, four-dimensional space, Zeno's paradoxes, Fermat's Last Theorem, and the four-color problem.Hofstadter (2010)", "Gardner set a new high standard for writing about mathematics.AMS Notices (2004): \"His crystalline prose, always enlightening, never pedantic, set a new standard for high quality mathematical popularization.\" \u2014Allyn Jackson.Lister (1995):  Martin Gardner's supreme achievement was his ability to communicate difficult and often profound subjects with a few deft, but human strokes of his pen.Mirsky (2010): \"His writing has been valued by generations of professional mathematicians.\"\u2013Ian StewartTeller (2014): \"Gardner writes with authority and ease. You trust him to take you wherever he feels like going.\"Hofstadter (2010): Martin had a magical touch in writing about math. In a 2004 interview he said, \"I go up to calculus, and beyond that I don't understand any of the papers that are being written. I consider that that was an advantage for the type of column I was doing because I had to understand what I was writing about, and that enabled me to write in such a way that an average reader could understand what I was saying. If you are writing popularly about math, I think it's good not to know too much math.\" John Horton Conway called him \"the most learned man I have ever met.\"", "Gardner's role as a hub of this network helped facilitate several introductions that led to further fruitful collaborations.Propp (2015): \"Before there were search engines, the intellectual world relied on human hubs to serve as repositories of knowledge and connectors of people with common interests who otherwise would not have known one another. Martin Gardner was such a connector. His column was the best mathematical watering hole of its day, and behind the scenes he served as a tireless mathematical match-maker. Gardner was a hub par excellence.\" Mathematicians Conway, Berlekamp, and Guy, who met as a result of Gardner's influence, would go on to write Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays, a foundational book in combinatorial game theory that Gardner championed.Berlekamp (2014):  Partly because of what I had read about them in Martin Gardner\u2019s columns, I was appropriately awestruck in the 1960s when I first met Sol Golomb and then Richard Guy, each of whom had a large influence on my subsequent work. In 1969 Richard introduced me to John Horton Conway, and the three of us immediately began collaborating on a book that eventually became Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays. In the 1970s, I joined Conway in some of his many visits to Gardner\u2019s home on Euclid Avenue, in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. Gardner soon became an enthusiastic advocate of our book project, and he previewed various snippets of it in his Scientific American columns. Gardner also introduced Conway to Benoit Mandelbrot because he knew of their mutual interest in Penrose tiles.Gardner (2013) page 144: Conway had been making new discoveries about Penrose tiling, and Mandelbrot was interested because Penrose tiling patterns are fractals. Gardner's network was also responsible for introducing Doris Schattschneider and Marjorie Rice, who worked together to document the newly discovered pentagon tilings..", "* John Horton Conway ", "A second such get-together was held in 1996, again with Gardner in attendance.

Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, endgame tables are available that dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.  This implies that, given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible.  In this scenario, the winning player can announce that a checkmate will happen within a given number of moves, assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable. Another hands-on example of generative processes is John Horton Conway's playable Game of Life.
