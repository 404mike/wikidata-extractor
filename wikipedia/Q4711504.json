He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler who played for Essex. He was born and died in Great Leighs.\nWright made two appearances during the 1931 County Championship, and one in 1934. He was steady, if unspectacular, with the bat, in the lower order, managing to put up decent totals around crumbling teammates up until his final game, when in his second innings, he scored just one run.\nThough he bowled somewhat economically, he took no wickets during his three first-class games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albert Wright", "response": ["Albert Wright may refer to:", "*Albert Wright (Australian cricketer) (1875\u20131938), Australian cricketer", "*Albert Wright (cricketer, born 1899) (1899\u20131987), English cricketer for Northamptonshire", "*Albert Wright (cricketer, born 1902) (1902\u20131984), English cricketer for Essex", "*Albert Wright (cricketer, born 1941), English cricketer for Warwickshire", "*Chalky Wright (1912\u20131957), born Albert Wright, Mexican-American featherweight boxer and world champion"]}]}}
