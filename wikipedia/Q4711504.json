He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler who played for Essex. He was born and died in Great Leighs.\nWright made two appearances during the 1931 County Championship, and one in 1934. He was steady, if unspectacular, with the bat, in the lower order, managing to put up decent totals around crumbling teammates up until his final game, when in his second innings, he scored just one run.\nThough he bowled somewhat economically, he took no wickets during his three first-class games.", "link_mentions": {}}}
