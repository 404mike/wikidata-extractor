According to his biographer, Asser, writing in 893, \"In the year of our Lord's Incarnation 849 Alfred, King of the Anglo-Saxons\", was born at the royal estate called Wantage, in the district known as Berkshire (which is so called from Berroc Wood, where the box tree grows very abundantly).\" This date has been accepted by the editors of Asser's biography, Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, and by other historians such as David Dumville and Richard Huscroft. West Saxon genealogical lists state that Alfred was 23 when he became king in April 871, implying that he was born between April 847 and April 848. This dating is adopted in the biography of Alfred by Alfred Smyth, who regards Asser's biography as fraudulent, an allegation which is rejected by other historians. Richard Abels in his biography discusses both sources but does not decide between them and dates Alfred's birth as 847/849, while Patrick Wormald in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article dates it 848/849. Berkshire had been historically disputed between Wessex and Mercia, and as late as 844, a charter showed that it was part of Mercia, but Alfred's birth in the county is evidence that, by the late 840s, control had passed to Wessex.", "One might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the Vulgate Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of Orosius's Histories against the Pagans and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences. Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest this also for Bald's Leechbook and the anonymous Old English Martyrology."]}, {"page": "Bretwalda", "response": ["Over the later 20th century, this assumption was increasingly challenged.

In 1991, Steven Fanning argued that \"it is unlikely that the term ever existed as a title or was in common usage in Anglo-Saxon England\"..  The fact that Bede never mentioned a special title for the kings in his list implies that he was unaware of one.  In 1995, Simon Keynes observed that \"if Bede's concept of the Southumbrian overlord, and the chronicler's concept of the 'Bretwalda', are to be regarded as artificial constructs, which have no validity outside the context of the literary works in which they appear, we are released from the assumptions about political development which they seem to involve... we might ask whether kings in the eighth and ninth centuries were quite so obsessed with the establishment of a pan-Southumbrian state\".."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred the Unready", "response": ["Nevertheless, at first, the outlook of the new king's officers and counsellors seems in no way to have been bleak.

Chief among the rehabilitators has been Simon Keynes, who has often argued that our poor impression of \u00c6thelred is almost entirely based upon after-the-fact accounts of, and later accretions to, the narrative of events during \u00c6thelred's long and complex reign. Chief among the culprits is in fact one of the most important sources for the history of the period, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which, as it reports events with a retrospect of 15 years, cannot help but interpret events with the eventual English defeat a foregone conclusion."]}, {"page": "Edmund I", "response": ["Edmund inherited overlordship over the kings of Wales from \u00c6thelstan, but Idwal Foel, king of Gwynedd in north Wales, apparently took advantage of Edmund's early weakness to withhold fealty and may have supported Anlaf Guthfrithson, as according to the Annales Cambri\u00e6 he was killed by the English in 942 and his kingdom was then conquered by Hywel Dda, the king of Deheubarth in south Wales. Attestations of Welsh kings to English charters appear to have been rare compared with those in \u00c6thelstan's reign, but in the historian David Dumville's view there is no reason to doubt that Edmund retained his overlordship over the Welsh kings. Attestations became more common again after Eadred succeeded Edmund. In a charter of 944 disposing of land in Devon, Edmund is styled \"king of the English and ruler of this British province\", suggesting that the former British kingdom of Dumnonia was still not regarded as fully integrated into England, although the historian Simon Keynes \"suspects some 'local' interference\" in the wording of Edmund's title."]}, {"page": "Emma of Normandy", "response": ["This flattery, writes Elizabeth M.

His dominance never extended to Northumbria, though he gave his daughter \u00c6lffl\u00e6d in marriage to the Northumbrian king \u00c6thelred I in 792. Historians once saw his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view: in the words of a recent historian, \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\"Simon Keynes, \"Offa\", in Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0340. His son Ecgfrith succeeded him after his death, but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.", "In the first half of the 8th century, the dominant Anglo-Saxon ruler was King \u00c6thelbald of Mercia, who by 731 had become the overlord of all the provinces south of the River Humber.Bede, HE, V, 23, p.\u00a0324. \u00c6thelbald was one of a number of strong Mercian kings who ruled from the mid-7th century to the early 9th, and it was not until the reign of Egbert of Wessex in the 9th century that Mercian power began to wane.Simon Keynes, \"Mercia\", in Lapidge, Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0307.", "Offa appears to have exploited an unstable situation in Kent after 762.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p.\u00a0165. Kent had a long tradition of joint kingship, with east and west Kent under separate kings, though one king was typically dominant.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a032. Prior to 762 Kent was ruled by \u00c6thelberht II and Eadberht I; Eadberht's son Eardwulf is also recorded as a king. \u00c6thelberht died in 762, and Eadberht and Eardwulf are last mentioned in that same year. Charters from the next two years mention other kings of Kent, including Sigered, Eanmund and Heahberht. In 764, Offa granted land at Rochester in his own name, with Heahberht on the witness list as king of Kent. Another king of Kent, Ecgberht, appears on a charter in 765 along with Heahberht; the charter was subsequently confirmed by Offa.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp.\u00a0206\u2013207. Offa's influence in Kent at this time is clear, and it has been suggested that Heahberht was installed by Offa as his client. There is less agreement among historians on whether Offa had general overlordship of Kent thereafter. He is known to have revoked a charter of Ecgberht's on the grounds that \"it was wrong that his thegn should have presumed to give land allotted to him by his lord into the power of another without his witness\", but the date of Ecgberht's original grant is unknown, as is the date of Offa's revocation of it.The evidence comes from a charter of Coenwulf of Mercia's in 799, in which he grants the land again, quoting the grounds on which Offa revoked it, but without giving any date. The charter is translated in Whitelock, English Historical Documents, 80, p.\u00a0470. It may be that Offa was the effective overlord of Kent from 764 until at least 776. The limited evidence for Offa's direct involvement in the kingdom between 765 and 776 includes two charters of 774 in which he grants land in Kent; but there are doubts about their authenticity, so Offa's intervention in Kent prior to 776 may have been limited to the years 764\u201365.Kirby quotes Stenton's comment that Ecgberht was \"a mere dependant\" of Offa's, and gives his opinion that there is \"no certain evidence\" of this. On the other hand, Keynes agrees with Stenton that Offa \"[took] control of Kent in the 760s\". Simon Keynes, \"Offa\", in Lapidge, Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0340; Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0207; Kirby, Earliest English Kings, pp.\u00a0165\u2013166.", "The nature of Mercian kingship is not clear from the limited surviving sources. There are two main theories regarding the ancestry of Mercian kings of this period. One is that descendants of different lines of the royal family competed for the throne. In the mid-7th century, for example, Penda had placed royal kinsmen in control of conquered provinces.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, pp.\u00a0119\u2013120 Alternatively, it may be that a number of kin-groups with local power-bases may have competed for the succession. The sub-kingdoms of the Hwicce, the Toms\u00e6te and the unidentified Gaini are examples of such power-bases. Marriage alliances could also have played a part. Competing magnates, those called in charters \"dux\" or \"princeps\" (that is, leaders), may have brought the kings to power. In this model, the Mercian kings are little more than leading noblemen.For all this, see Keynes, \"Mercia and Wessex in the Ninth Century\", pp.\u00a0314\u2013323, in Brown & Farr, Mercia; see also Williams, \"Military Institutions and Royal Power\", pp.\u00a0304\u2013305. Offa seems to have attempted to increase the stability of Mercian kingship, both by the elimination of dynastic rivals to his son Ecgfrith, and the reduction in status of his subject kings, sometimes to the rank of ealdorman.Yorke, Anglo-Saxons, pp.\u00a043\u201344. He was ultimately unsuccessful, however; Ecgfrith only survived in power for a few months, and 9th century Mercia continued to draw its kings from multiple dynastic lines.Simon Keynes, \"Mercia and Wessex in the Ninth Century\", in Brown & Farr, Mercia, p.\u00a0314.", "In Anglo-Saxon England, Stenton argued that Offa was perhaps the greatest king of the English kingdoms, commenting that \"no other Anglo-Saxon king ever regarded the world at large with so\u00a0... acute a political sense\".Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0224. Many historians regard Offa's achievements as second only to Alfred the Great among the Anglo-Saxon kings.For example, Peter Hunter Blair describes him as \"perhaps the greatest of all the Anglo-Saxon kings, save only Alfred\"; Blair, Introduction, p. 53. Offa's reign has sometimes been regarded as a key stage in the transition to a unified England, but this is no longer the general view among historians in the field. In the words of Simon Keynes, \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\" It is now believed that Offa thought of himself as \"King of the Mercians,\" and that his military successes were part of the transformation of Mercia from an overlordship of midland peoples into a powerful and aggressive kingdom.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0114.", "Offa died on 29 July 796,Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p.\u00a0177.Brown & Farr, Mercia: An Anglo-Saxon Kingdom In Europe, p. 310 and may be buried in Bedford, though it is not clear that the \"Bedeford\" named in that charter was actually modern Bedford.Whitelock, English Historical Documents, 79, pp.\u00a0468\u2013470.Simon Keynes, \"Cynethryth\", in Lapidge, Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0133. He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p.\u00a050. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith \"has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you know very well how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son.\"Whitelock, English Historical Documents, 202, pp.\u00a0786\u2013788. It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0118."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d", "response": ["In 909 Edward sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to the northern Danelaw, where it raided for five weeks. The remains of the royal Northumbrian saint Oswald were seized and taken from his resting place in Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire to Gloucester. In the late ninth century Gloucester had become a burh with a street plan similar to Winchester, and \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d had repaired its ancient Roman defences. In 896 a meeting of the Mercian witan was held in the royal hall at Kingsholm, just outside the town. The Mercian rulers built a new minster in Gloucester and, although the building was small, it was embellished on a grand scale, with rich sculpture. The church appears to have been an exact copy of the Old Minster, Winchester. It was initially dedicated to St Peter but when Oswald's remains were brought to Gloucester in 909, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d had them translated from Bardney to the new minster, which was renamed St Oswald's in his honour. The relics gave the church great prestige as Oswald had been one of the most important founding saints of Anglo-Saxon Christianity as well as a ruling monarch, and the decision to translate his relics to Gloucester shows the importance of the town to \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who were buried in St Oswald's Minster. Simon Keynes describes the town as \"the main seat of their power\" and Carolyn Heighway believes that the foundation of the church was probably a family and dynastic enterprise, encouraged by Alfred and supported by Edward and Bishop Werferth. Heighway and Michael Hare wrote:", "Simon Keynes points out that all coins were issued in Edward's name, and while the Mercian rulers were able to issue some charters on their own authority, others acknowledged Edward's lordship. In 903 a Mercian ealdorman \"petitioned King Edward, and also \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians under the aforesaid king\". Keynes argues that a new polity was created when \u00c6thelred submitted to Alfred in the 880s, covering Wessex and English (western) Mercia. In Keynes's view, \"the conclusion seems inescapable that the Alfredian polity of the kingship 'of the Anglo-Saxons' persisted in the first quarter of the tenth century, and that the Mercians were thus under Edward's rule from the beginning of his reign\".

Egbert followed it up by sending \u00c6thelwulf with Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Wulfheard, Ealdorman of Hampshire, with a large army into Kent to expel sub-king Baldred. \u00c6thelwulf was descended from kings of Kent, and he was sub-king of Kent, and of Surrey, Sussex and Essex, which were then included in the sub-kingdom, until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839. His sub-kingship is recorded in charters, in some of which King Egbert acted with his son's permission, such as a grant in 838 to Bishop Beornmod of Rochester, and \u00c6thelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year. Unlike their Mercian predecessors, who alienated the Kentish people by ruling from a distance, \u00c6thelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests. In Abels' view, Egbert and \u00c6thelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters. Historians take differing views on the attitude of the new regime to the Kentish church. At Canterbury in 828 Egbert granted privileges to the bishopric of Rochester, and according to the historian of Anglo-Saxon England Simon Keynes, Egbert and \u00c6thelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred. However, the medievalist Nicholas Brooks argues that Wulfred's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability. \u00c6thelwulf seized an estate in East Malling from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces; the issue of archiepiscopal coinage was suspended for several years; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King Wiglaf of Mercia."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex", "response": ["Asser is the sole source for the dispute between \u00c6thelwulf and \u00c6thelbald, which is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and according to Asser when \u00c6thelwulf returned to England he agreed to divide the kingdom to avoid a civil war. Most historians state that \u00c6thelbald kept Wessex while \u00c6thelberht agreed to surrender the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex to \u00c6thelwulf, although Simon Keynes thinks that \u00c6thelwulf kept a degree of sovereignty. Some historians argue that it is more likely that Wessex itself was divided, with \u00c6thelbald keeping his power base west of Selwood, \u00c6thelwulf taking the east and \u00c6thelberht keeping Kent. Pauline Stafford and D. P. Kirby point out that Asser implies that Judith became queen of the West Saxons in 856. Sean Miller observes that Asser complained that the \"son ruled where by rightful judgment the father should have done; for the western part of the Saxon land has always been more important than the eastern\", and since Kent had been conquered only thirty years previously, it did not make sense to speak of it as having always been a less important part of the kingdom."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelberht, King of Wessex", "response": ["The historian Simon Keynes sees this charter as:"]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelstan", "response": ["According to William of Malmesbury, \u00c6thelstan was thirty years old when he came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born around 894.Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, p. 29 He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder.

Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if they were part of the text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition (with 130 pages of introduction) by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard Latin text: this was translated into English in 1905 by Albert S. Cook.Abels, Alfred the Great, p. 328. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.Richard Abels (Alfred the Great, p. 328) describes Keynes and Lapidge's book as \"The best collection of primary sources in translation\", and \"an indispensable guide to the scholarly problems and issues surrounding these works\"."]}, {"page": "Pershore Abbey", "response": ["The refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf. The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. Simon Keynes in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called Orthodoxorum group of charters, so named after the initial word of their proem, which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of \u00c6thelred II's reign.Keynes, The diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016, pp. 98-100 Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters.Hudson, Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, pp. cxcix-cciv More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in c. 1002 (see below).Stokes, \"King Edgar's charter for Pershore, 972\", pp. 72-3."]}, {"page": "Wulfhere of Mercia", "response": ["The main source for this period is Bede's History, completed in about 731. Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work also provides valuable information about the early pagan kingdoms. For other kingdoms than his native Northumbria, such as Wessex and Kent, Bede had an informant within the ecclesiastical establishment who supplied him with additional information. This does not seem to have been the case with Mercia, about which Bede is less informative than about other kingdoms.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 100  Further sources for this period include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, compiled at the end of the 9th century in Wessex. The Chronicle's anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much information recorded in earlier periods.Simon Keynes, \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", in Blackwell Encyclopedia, p. 35", "Wulfhere's influence among the Lindesfara, whose territory, Lindsey, lay in what is now Lincolnshire, is known from information about episcopal authority. At least one of the Mercian bishops of Lichfield is known to have exercised authority there: Wynfrith, who became bishop on Chad's death in 672.Williams, Kingship and Government p. 21.  In addition it is known that Wulfhere gave land at Barrow upon Humber, in Lindsey, to Chad, for a monastery.Simon Keynes, \"Wulfhere\", in Blackwell Encyclopedia, p. 490  It is possible that Chad also had authority there as bishop, probably no later than 669.  It may be that the political basis for Mercian episcopal control of the Lindesfara was laid early in Wulfhere's reign, under Trumhere and Jaruman, the two bishops who preceded Chad."]}, {"page": "Coenwulf of Mercia", "response": ["For most of the 8th century, Mercia was dominant among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber. \u00c6thelbald, who came to the throne in 716, had established himself as the overlord of the southern Anglo-Saxons by 731.Simon Keynes, \"Mercia\", in Lapidge et al., Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0306. He was assassinated in 757, and was briefly succeeded by Beornred, but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself. Offa's daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789, and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0210.

Coenwulf's body was moved to Winchcombe where it was buried in St Mary's Abbey (later known as Winchcombe Abbey). A mid-11th-century source asserts that Cynehelm briefly succeeded to the throne while still a child and was then murdered by his tutor \u00c6scberht at the behest of Cwoenthryth. This version of events \"bristles with historical problems\", according to one historian, and it is also possible that Cynehelm is to be identified with an ealdorman who is found witnessing charters earlier in Coenwulf's reign, and who appears to have died by about 812.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0119. The opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point: Simon Keynes has suggested that the ealdorman is unlikely to be the same person as the prince and that Cynehelm therefore may well have survived to the end of his father's reign. Regardless of interpretation of Cynehelm's legend, there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in Ceolwulf's reign: a document from 825 says that after the death of Coenwulf \"much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings, nobles, bishops and ministers of the Church of God on very many matters of secular business\"."]}, {"page": "Florence of Worcester", "response": ["That said, the debt to Florence acknowledged by John in the entry for 1118 is considerable. One possibility if ultimately unverifiable is that Florence's contribution lay in assembling the source materials which John consulted for the entries covering the period between the ninth and eleventh century. A precedent for such a task commissioned by Bishop Wulfstan is the compilation and production of a cartulary, called Hemming's Cartulary, by the monk Hemming. Since nearly half a century lies between Wulfstan's death (1095) and John's final entry (1140), historian Simon Keynes has offered the tentative suggestion that Florence may have been the monk first commissioned by Wulfstan to compile material for a world chronicle and that John continued the task. According to the historian Nick Higham, William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester probably both followed a lost text of Florence.Higham, \"Edward the Elder's Reputation\", p. 2"]}, {"page": "List of English monarchs", "response": ["Arguments are made for a few different kings thought to control enough Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to be deemed the first king of England. For example, Offa of Mercia and Egbert of Wessex are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but it is no longer the majority view of historians that their wide dominions are part of a process leading to a unified England. Historian Simon Keynes states, for example, that \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\" This refers to a period in the late 8th century when Offa achieved a dominance over many of the kingdoms of southern England, but this did not survive his death in 796.

Alternatively, a divided rule has been suggested, since the so-called Mercian register of the Chronicle reports that \u00c6thelstan became king of the Mercians, and William of Malmesbury, though denying a reign for \u00c6lfweard, reports that \u00c6thelstan was educated at the Mercian court of his aunt \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d.Walker, Mercia and the Making of England. p. 127. In the view of Simon Keynes, \u00c6lfweard was recognised as king in Wessex and \u00c6thelstan in Mercia, and although it is possible that Edward intended a division of the kingdom after his death, it is more likely that the leaders of Wessex chose \u00c6lfweard and Mercia set up \u00c6thelstan in opposition.Keynes, 'Rulers of the English', p. 514"]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians", "response": ["London suffered severely from Viking attacks and was several times occupied by Viking armies.

The bequest to the three brothers would only have covered part of \u00c6thelwulf's property. The transmission of folkland was governed by customary law, and another portion was reserved for the holder of the office of king. Keynes and Lapidge argue that \u00c6thelwulf clearly intended that his personal property should be preserved intact, and it seems to have been considered desirable that this should be held by the reigning king, so it is likely that he intended the kingship of western Wessex to be inherited by the survivor of the three brothers.
