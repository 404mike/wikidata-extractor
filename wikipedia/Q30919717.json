Two days later in his first match, Shrewsbury won 2\u20131 against Walsall to reach the third round of the EFL Trophy; he was the first manager to win on his Shrewsbury debut since Graham Turner in 2010. He brought in eight players in the January 2019 transfer window including Tyrese Campbell, Ro-Shaun Williams and Scott Golbourne. In early 2019, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup. The club's cup run ended at the hands of rivals, and one of Ricketts' former clubs, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Town were 2\u20130 up in the original tie at New Meadow with just under 20 minutes to play, but late goals from Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Matt Doherty took the tie to a replay at Molineux. Ricketts' Shrewsbury side went 2\u20131 up in the replay, only to eventually lose 3\u20132. A 1\u20131 draw away at Coventry City on 28 April mathematically secured League One survival for Ricketts and the club.", "In the summer of 2019, Ricketts made more notable signings to strengthen the squad for the upcoming 2019\u201320 season, bringing in players such as Jason Cummings from Nottingham Forest, Sean Goss from Queens Park Rangers, Donald Love from Sunderland, Ethan Ebanks-Landell from Wolves and Aaron Pierre from Northampton Town. Ricketts started the season with a 1\u20130 win at home to Portsmouth on 4 August, with loanee Ryan Giles scoring the goal. During the 2019\u201320 season, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup for the second time during his management spell, defeating Bradford City, Mansfield Town and Bristol City along the way. The fourth round would see Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side host Premier League leaders and European and World champions Liverpool, where Shrewsbury came from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 with 2 goals from substitute Jason Cummings, forcing a replay at Anfield. In the replay, Shrewsbury fell short after a Shaun Whalley goal was disallowed by VAR for offside and an own goal from Ro-Shaun Williams saw the hosts win 1\u20130. This cup run brought repercussions, however, as Ricketts and the club went 10 league games without a win between December 2019 and February 2020. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Accrington Stanley on 11 February 2020 followed by another 2\u20130 defeat away at Portsmouth on 15 February put Ricketts' job under severe pressure. The winless run ended a week later on 22 February after a 1\u20130 win at home to Doncaster Rovers. On 14 March 2020, Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side were scheduled to take on top-of-the-table Coventry City at St Andrew's, however the match was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, the 2019\u201320 League One season was cut short and it was decided that final league positions would be based on a points-per-game basis. This saw the club finish 15th in the final table."]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["| Ro-Shaun Williams"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 January 2019 || CB ||  || Ro-Shaun Williams || Manchester United || Undisclosed || 2\u00bd years || "]}, {"page": "RoShaun Williams", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ro-Shaun Williams"]}, {"page": "Roshaun Omar Stuart Williams", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ro-Shaun Williams"]}, {"page": "Neco Williams", "response": ["Following the turn of the year, he starred in a team largely made up of teenagers and reserves that defeated Merseyside rivals Everton in the FA Cup 3rd round, and Shrewsbury Town in the 4th round replay, forcing an own goal from Ro-Shaun Williams in the latter fixture to secure his side's progression in the competition. In the match against Shrewsbury, Williams was also part of a starting line-up that was the youngest in Liverpool's history, with an average age of 19 years and two days. His Premier League debut followed on 24 June 2020, shortly after campaign resumed following a three-month long suspension caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, when he featured as a 74th-minute substitute in a 4\u20130 win over Crystal Palace. Williams would go on to make enough appearances to secure his league winners' medal, and a few weeks later on 17 August, he signed a new long-term deal with the Reds."]}]}}
