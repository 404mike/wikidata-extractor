Assured subjective survival can follow from the quantum suicide idea only if an agent reasons in terms of \"what will be experienced next\" instead of the more obvious \"what will happen next, whether will be experienced or not\". He writes: \"[...] it is by no means obvious why Everettians should modify their intensity ruleBy \"intensity rule\", Lewis and Papineau mean the Born rule, the rule used to apportion probabilities in quantum mechanical events. in this way. For it seems perfectly open for them to apply the unmodified intensity rule in life-or-death situations, just as elsewhere. If they do this, then they can expect all futures in proportion to their intensities, whether or not those futures contain any of their live successors. For example, even when you know you are about to be the subject in a fifty-fifty Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s experiment, you should expect a future branch where you perish, to just the same degree as you expect a future branch where you survive.\""]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (D\u2013H)", "response": ["* David Papineau"]}, {"page": "Panpsychism", "response": ["Panpsychism has recently seen a resurgence in the philosophy of mind, set into motion by Thomas Nagel's 1979 article \"Panpsychism\"Nagel, Thomas (1979), \"Panpsychism\", in  and further spurred by Galen Strawson's 2006 realistic monist article \"Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism.\"Strawson, Galen (2006). \"Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism\".
