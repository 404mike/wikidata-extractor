However, he concluded that \"it's a very good haunted castle, and even those who don't normally enjoy dungeon bashes will probably find it interesting and enjoyable. There are some interestingly Oriental bits and pieces which maintain the atmosphere nicely\". He felt that some of the encounters were tough for the suggested party strength, although he suggested that a reasonable number of spellcasters should help to cope with that. He felt that it would have been nice to have a poster-size map of Maeshi Province, but found that the two main settings of the castle and the inn would make useful stock locations for OA. Davis concluded that the adventure is \"an interesting and well-balanced mixture of role-playing and fighting\". He considered having OA2 and OA1 in different provinces to be a drawback, although he figured that a DM wanting to link the two adventures in a campaign should be able to tweak the setting and history with a little work.

He pointed out that the \"village [was] packed with adventurers (of up to 7th level!)\" and the \"agoraphobic\" cloud giant living in the \"smallest castle [he's] ever seen\", but felt that the \"interesting encounter with the Shadow Lord's army lightens the otherwise fairly uninspiring zoo-dungeon journey until the adventurers reach the Shadow Lord's lair for the really serious dungeon-bashing\". He noted some good aspects about the final encounter, particularly how the villains' tactics are outlined, as well as notes for the Dungeon Master on what to do next based on whether the PCs win, lose, or even miss the object of their quest. Davis considered The Halls of Drax Tallen repetitive, with the encounters \"no more inspired than the first lot\", and found \"nothing staggeringly inventive or exciting\" about the new magic items and monsters. Overall, Davis was disappointed by the module, as it gave him \"the impression that no developments had taken place in the hobby in the last few years\", with its \"simple plot, lots of encounters and plenty of action, all firmly rooted in the original tradition of the game\".Still, he conceded that \"it does what it sets out to do perfectly adequately, and if an action-packed blood-and-thunder adventure without too much emphasis on plot and justification is your kind of thing, Saga of the Shadow Lords is worth looking at\"."]}, {"page": "Eberron novels", "response": ["* Blood and Honor (Graeme Davis, September 2006, )"]}, {"page": "Adventure Pack I", "response": ["In his review for Adventure Pack I for White Dwarf No. 92, Graeme Davis said, \"I'm confused over why this product is called I13 rather than REF5; it certainly has more in common with the two Books of Lairs than with any of the Desert of Desolation adventures\". Of the adventures, he said that \"some are thinly-disguised monster bashes, whilst others rely on thought and subtlety. Some look like Book of Lairs ideas which grew in the writing, and some are not so easily classified.\" Davis concluded by noting that the adventures were designed to be used at any point in a game, and were generally long enough for a single evening of play.

The main villain is a very nasty piece of work, and has a range of new spells and special powers which will appeal to hardware buffs once again.  The showdown in his castle is a standard dungeon bash, and so, really, is the whole adventure, but the special effects of this alternate dimension make it more interesting than the general run of hack and slay adventures.  It's quite heavy going, and I think it might give a party of up to 10th level a good run for their money.  There are powerful monsters, less powerful ones in great numbers [...] and a couple of whimsical touches that you will either love or loathe, like zombies wearing magical sunglasses which allow them to see through fog, and a gnoll with a pump-action shotgun.  There is a very interesting twist to the final encounter, too, which may lead to a dilemma for at least one member of the party.\" Davis concludes his review by saying, \"If you're looking for an old-fashioned mid-level dungeon bash with some interesting twists, this one is for you.\""]}, {"page": "Fez IV: Wizard's Revenge", "response": ["Graeme Davis reviewed Wizard's Revenge for White Dwarf #90.

When he first appears, he has been accidentally summoned from the Illinois-Ohio football game, and is dressed in a sweatshirt, jeans and a baseball cap and clutching a can of cold beer.  All very well if you like this sort of whimsy.  The dungeons themselves (there are several) are small, mostly sketchily written, and favour traps and riddles.  There is a lot which can only be described as corny \u2013 'Penultimate Mountain' next to 'Last Mountain,' for example \u2013 and the whole thing was very reminiscent of the kind of AD&D adventure that White Dwarf was publishing seven or eight years ago.
