D. Blackmore, was one of the most famous English novelists of the second half of the nineteenth century. He won acclaim for vivid descriptions and personification of the countryside, sharing with Thomas Hardy a Western England background and a strong sense of regional setting in his works.\n\nBlackmore, often referred to as the \"Last Victorian\", was a pioneer of the movement in fiction that continued with Robert Louis Stevenson and others. He has been described as \"proud, shy, reticent, strong-willed, sweet-tempered, and self-centred.\" Apart from his novel Lorna Doone, which has enjoyed continuing popularity, his work has gone out of print.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dartmoor", "response": ["Dartmoor has inspired a number of artists and writers, such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventure of Silver Blaze, R.
