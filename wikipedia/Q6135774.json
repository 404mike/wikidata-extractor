Together, residing in an estate in Wallingford, England, all four girls followed a Victorian system of four to ten art classes a day to ensure proper mastery of basic art techniques such as proportions. In addition to their rigorous training schedule, the girls spent the rest of their time at the estate engaging in relaxing activities such as outdoor sports, plain air painting, and gardening.

The family lived at Mecklenburgh Square in London and also rented a country house in Suffolk for several months each year before moving to a large house, Castle Priory, by the Thames at Wallingford, then in Berkshire. Hayllar and her four sisters attended a day school in Gower Street and all were given art lessons by their father, who was himself a well-regarded painter. Jessica Hayllar became the most prolific artist among the Hayllar offspring, although her sister Edith also achieved some recognition. Jessica Hayllar exhibited at the Royal Academy in London regularly between 1879 and 1915 and also had works shown at the Society of British Artists, with the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours and at the Royal Manchester Institution. She often painted domestic scenes, local villagers and depicted family occasions and gatherings. Windows and doorways were another frequent theme in her work. Ill health as a result of being knocked down by a carriage in 1900 greatly reduced her output in her later years when she was living in Bournemouth with her father. In her final years she mostly concentrated on painting flower pieces.", "Jessica Hayllar was born in 1858 into the middle-class family of James Hayllar and Ellen Cavell Hayllar.Mary Gabrielle Hayllar, \u201cFraming the Hayllar Sisters: A Multi-genre Biography of Four English Victorian Painters,\u201d (doctoral dissertation, University of New South Wales, 2012). She was the third child and the oldest daughter. Hayllar spent the majority of her childhood in the countryside of Wallingford at the family home, Castle Priory, where she and her siblings learned to paint from her father. James Hayllar provided his daughters with artistic training and their own separate studio, as well as all the materials they needed and established working hours. Their artistic training began with drawing, learning perspective, modelling in clay, etching, and engraving before progressing to painting.  The Hayllar sisters thus followed the traditional model of female artists learning from family members, even though public art classes were becoming more available for women at the time.Deborah Cherry, Painting Women: Victorian Women Artists (New York: Routledge, 1993).", "Hayllar lived with her parents throughout her life and never married. According to Christopher Wood, Hayllar\u2019s best works were painted from 1885 to 1900 and primarily consist of domestic scenes at Castle Priory.Christopher Wood, \u201cThe Artistic Family Hayllar, Part 1: James Hayllar,\u201d The Connoisseur, April (1974), 266-73.Christopher Wood, \u201cThe Artistic Family Hayllar, Part 2: Jessica, Edith, Mary and Kate,\u201d The Connoisseur, May (1974), 2-9. In 1899, Jessica moved with her parents from Castle Priory to a smaller home in Bournemouth, where she continued to live with her father after her mother\u2019s death. Hayllar became partially paralyzed in a carriage accident in 1900. She would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair, but she continued her artistic work. After the accident, Hayllar\u2019s work tended to focus more on flowers, particularly azaleas.  Following her father\u2019s death in 1920, Jessica moved to Surrey to live with her sister Edith Hayllar MacKay. Jessica Hayllar died in 1940.", "While many Victorian women artists had the opportunity to attend formal training outside the home, the Hayllar sisters were all educated by their father. James Hayllar taught his children to depict popular subjects that would sell, and Jessica\u2019s work, along with her sisters\u2019, made a significant economic contribution to the family\u2019s income. This was somewhat unusual for women artists in the upper middle classes, since many did not want to undermine their reputations as \u201cgentlewomen.\u201d However, Hayllar was a professional artist, preparing artworks for exhibitions, promoting her work, and participating in interviews for newspapers and journals.", "Jessica Hayllar\u2019s work was obviously strongly influenced by that of her father, James Hayllar, who was her primary artistic instructor. Based on James\u2019 instruction, his daughters\u2019 artworks were meant to be meticulously realistic. Compared to her father\u2019s work, Jessica Hayllar\u2019s work is less academic. It tends to be smaller scale and less elaborate, with fewer figures. It is also less idyllic and sentimental. The influence of James Hayllar is, however, felt in Jessica Hayllar\u2019s meticulous details and near-photographic realism. It is seen also in Hayllar\u2019s subject matters, which focus on upper middle-class life and the social spaces of middle class femininity. Hayllar himself often painted portraits, genre scenes, and still life pieces. Jessica\u2019s work is often tied to that of her sisters, Mary, Edith, and Kate. In the Castle Priory years of Hayllar\u2019s work, they undoubtedly were large influences on each other. However, Jessica is the only sister who painted throughout her entire life. In contrast, Mary and Edith stopped painting after their marriages, and Kate became a nurse."]}]}}
