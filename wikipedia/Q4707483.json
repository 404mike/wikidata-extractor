He was educated at Eton College, before going up to Trinity College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against a combined Minor Counties cricket team at Oxford in 1939. Playing as a left-arm fast-medium bowler, he took the wickets of Frank Dennis and David Watson in the Minor Counties first innings, while in their second innings he dismissed Alan Parnaby and Watson, finishing with match figures of 4 for 128. With the declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, Farebrother's first-class career came to a premature end, though he did complete his studies."]}]}}
