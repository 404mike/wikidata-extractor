His fifth of the season arrived in a 2\u20130 away victory against Oldham on 21 December, tapping in from a Dominic Vose lay-off. He then scored in the following game on Boxing Day, a 4\u20130 demolition of Stevenage at the Colchester Community Stadium with an acrobatic volley. He seventh goal of the season came as Colchester fell to a 2\u20131 loss at home to Preston North End on 22 February 2014, and his eighth proved to be the only goal of the game against Shrewsbury Town on 18 March with a low left-foot shot.
