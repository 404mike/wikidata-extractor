She was born in 1940 in Austria to a Polish mother, and came to England in 1947. Her stepfather, Ronald Benge, was a prominent librarian who established library schools in developing countries. She has been married to musician Robert Wyatt since 1974. She has contributed lyrics to many of his compositions, and has written lyrics for French musician/producer Bertrand Burgalat, and for Brazilian singer Monica Vasconcelos.\nBenge studied painting at Camberwell Art School, graphics at the London School of Printing, film at the RCA, worked in film, and served as an assistant to the editor Graeme Clifford for Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (1973). She has provided cover artwork for all Wyatt's solo albums since 1974, as well as for albums by other musicians including Gravity by Fred Frith, Alice by Klimperei and Spanish Dance Troupe by Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. She has illustrated two children's books written by Ivor Cutler.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Wyatt", "response": ["Wyatt retired from his music career in 2014, stating \"there is a pride in [stopping], I don\u2019t want [the music] to go off.\" He is married to English painter and songwriter Alfreda Benge.", "In a BBC Radio 4 profile aired in 2012, Wyatt revealed that he and his wife Alfreda Benge were also given generous help by friends of Benge's, including supermodel Jean Shrimpton, who gave them a car, and actress Julie Christie, who gave them use of a flat in London, which they subsequently purchased from her. In the same interview, Wyatt also observed that, ironically, his accident probably saved his life \u2013 although he did not drink at all when he was younger, he quickly fell into a pattern of heavy drinking while touring the US in the late 1960s supporting The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and that he often caroused with heavy-drinking colleagues like Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding and especially Keith Moon (who introduced him to the practice of alternating shots of tequila and Southern Comfort). By his own estimation, he was an alcoholic by the early 1970s, and he felt that, had the accident not intervened to change his lifestyle, his heavy drinking and reckless behaviour would have eventually killed him.", "In the late 1980s, after collaborations with other acts such as News from Babel, Scritti Politti, and Japanese recording artist Ryuichi Sakamoto, he and his wife Alfreda Benge spent a sabbatical in Spain, before returning in 1991 with a comeback album Dondestan. His 1997 album Shleep was also praised.", "The verb \"Wyatting\" appeared in some blogs and music magazines to describe the practice of playing unusual tracks, in particular songs from Wyatt's album Dondestan, on a pub jukebox to annoy the other pub goers. Wyatt was quoted in 2006 in The Guardian as saying \"I think it's really funny\" and \"I'm very honoured at the idea of becoming a verb.\" When asked if he would ever try it himself, he said: \"I don't really like disconcerting people, but even when I try to be normal I disconcert anyway.\" However, Alfreda Benge said it made her angry \"that Robert should be used as a means of clever dicks asserting their superiority in pubs ... It's so unlike Robert, because he's so appreciative of the strengths of pop music. So that, I think, is a real unfairness. The man who coined it, I should like to punch him in the nose.\"", "Wyatt is married to English painter and songwriter Alfreda Benge.", "*2008 MBW (with Alfreda Benge), \u00c6ncrages & Co publishing"]}, {"page": "Gilad Atzmon", "response": ["In 1998, Atzmon joined veteran punk rock band Ian Dury and the Blockheads, while sustaining other projects.Stephen Robb, \"The old Blockheads shows go on\", BBC News, 25 January 2007.Sara Greek, Blockheads come to Hertford Corn Exchange , Hertfordshire Mercury, 28 October 2011.
