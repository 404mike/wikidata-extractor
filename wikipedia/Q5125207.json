However, he left her for Jacki Ellis, then the wife of Jeffrey Bernard, but in due course she left him. A sequence of affairs followed, including liaisons with Sarah Miles and Carly Simon. He left Miles for Simon, whom he described as \"the answer to any sane man's prayers; funny, quick, erotic, extravagantly talented\", but this did not prevent him from jilting her while they were engaged and returning to Miles.
