Several monuments from the old church were also preserved, including one to John Outeswich and his wife.  There was a fresco of the Ascension  by  John Francis Rigaud over the altar, which had deteriorated badly within ten years of being painted. When the church was first built  the pulpit was at the west end, with the pews facing away from the altar. The pulpit was moved to the west end as part of a programme of repairs and alterations by Charles Barry in 1827."]}, {"page": "King's Observatory", "response": ["The Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology in Oxford has a portrait, Peter Rigaud and Mary Anne Rigaud, by the 18th-century painter John Francis Rigaud.

The picture, painted when they were aged four and seven, shows them in a park landscape with the observatory (where their father was observer) in the background.
