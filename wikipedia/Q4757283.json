Later workers split Bactris into several genera (Guilielma, Augustinea, Pyrenoglyphis, Amylocarpus and Yuyba) and described several hundred species.

In their 2005 World Checklist of Palms Raf\u00e4el Govaerts and John Dransfield accepted A.\u00a0spectabilis as a valid taxon but Sidney F Glassman considered it a dubious taxon in his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae.  Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors;Balick et al. 1987, Anderson and Balick 1988 Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A.\u00a0speciosa.

Burret described nine new species and ended up recognising a total of 41 species. In the 1940s, Liberty Hyde Bailey added 14 additional species to the genus Desmoncus. Jan Wessels Boer rejected the species concept used by Bailey, Barbosa Rodrigues, and Burret as being too narrow and ended up recognising only seven species In his 2011 revision of the genus, Andrew Henderson recognised 24 species."]}, {"page": "Attalea (plant)", "response": ["Disagreement exists as to whether Attalea should be considered a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano, and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera\u2014a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa, although he thought it likely that Ynesa colenda, the only member of that genus, was actually a hybrid. Raf\u00e4el Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus. ", "Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that as many as 100 species may be in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafa\u00ebl Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species. Taxonomic uncertainty is exacerbated by frequent hybridisation between species.", "The three recent treatments (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a total of 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted by all of them. The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40. For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, Attalea attaleoides, other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species. Glassman doubted the validity of A.\u00a0attaleoides as a species, and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A.\u00a0attaleoides\u2014A.\u00a0camopiensis, A.\u00a0degranvillei, A.\u00a0guianensis and A.\u00a0maripensis. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and A.\u00a0attaleoides. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was of the opinion that A.\u00a0guianensis, A.\u00a0maripensis and A.\u00a0attaleoides were all very similar, and thought it likely that they all represented the same species."]}, {"page": "Rodrigo Bernal", "response": ["Bernal coauthored a Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas and a field guide to the palms of Colombia (2010).

This 1995 book is known for tentatively lumping species, especially Astrocaryum. The information appears to have gotten mixed up when entered into the first IUCN database built in the 1990s, with the entry in the 1998 Red List book being under the heading A. alatum instead of A. confertum. The conservation status of A. confertum was stated to be \"indeterminate\" overall, and \"rare\" in Costa Rica and Panama. For more than two decades afterwards this mistake was repeated in the new online versions of the IUCN Red List, only now the conservation status was furthermore mistakenly changed to \"lower risk: near threatened\"."]}]}}
