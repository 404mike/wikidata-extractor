The murders were known in the media as the \"Pembrokeshire Murders\" or the \"Coastal Murders\". Cooper was also sentenced for the rape of a 16-year-old girl and a sexual assault on a 15-year-old girl, both carried out while a group of five teenagers were held at gunpoint in March 1996, in a wooded area behind the Mount Estate in Cooper's hometown of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire.\nCooper had a history of criminal activities, including 30 robberies and violent assault. Footage from the television game show Bullseye in May 1989, in which he appeared as a contestant, was later used as evidence against him, comparing his image with a sketch of a suspect in the Dixons' murder.\nCooper was sentenced to 14 years in 1998 for robbery and burglary. He was released from prison in January 2009. Because of subsequent developments in DNA and forensic science, the police carried out a cold case review in April 2009 and were able to identify Cooper's shotgun as being the murder weapon. Further DNA evidence was provided by forensic scientist Professor Angela Gallop. The police collected further evidence against him and Cooper was arrested again in May of that year. He was convicted, in May 2011, for the double murders and sexual assaults and sentenced to a whole life order.\nCooper has been linked to other, unsolved, crimes.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Keith Allen (actor)", "response": ["In January 2021, Keith Allen played serial killer and rapist John Cooper in the ITV 3-part drama, The Pembrokeshire Murders.", "| 2021 || The Pembrokeshire Murders ||John Cooper || TV Mini-Series"]}, {"page": "John (given name)", "response": ["*John Cooper (born 1944), Welsh serial killer"]}, {"page": "John Cooper", "response": ["John Cooper may refer to:", "* John Cooper (Islamic scholar) (Yahya Cooper) (1947-1998), British Islamic scholar and professor at the University of Cambridge", "* John Cooper (composer) (c. 1570\u20131626), English classical composer", "* John Cooper (actor) (1793\u20131870), English actor", "* John Cooper (artist) (1942\u20132015), English comic illustrator", "* John Cooper (author) (born 1958), Canadian writer and communications specialist", "* John Cooper (musician) (born 1975), American singer for Skillet", "* John Cooper (fl. 1980s\u20132010s), director of the Sundance Film Festival", "* John Cooper (British Army officer) (born 1955), commander of British forces in Iraq 2008", "* John Cooper (MP for Worcester), in 1380 and 1395 Member of Parliament (MP) for Worcester", "* John Cooper (MP for Maldon), in 1421 and 1425 MP for Maldon", "* John Cooper (fl. 1529), MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed", "* Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet (died 1630), English landowner and politician", "* John Cooper (died 1779), British politician", "* John Cooper (New Jersey politician) (1729\u20131785), public official from New Jersey during the American Revolution", "* John Cooper (Arkansas politician) (born 1947), member of the Arkansas State Senate since 2014", "* John Cooper (Tennessee politician) (born 1956), mayor of Nashville", "* John Cooper (barrister) (born 1958), British barrister and Queen's Counsel", "* John Cooper (footballer, born 1897) (1897\u20131975), English footballer", "* John Cooper (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1930s), Scottish footballer", "* John Cooper (car maker) (1923\u20132000), British racing driver & entrepreneur", "* John Cooper (cricketer) (1922-2012), Australian cricketer", "* John Cooper (Australian footballer) (born 1935), Australian footballer", "* John Cooper (American football) (born 1937), coach", "* John Cooper (motorcyclist) (born 1938), British Grand Prix motorcycle racer", "* John Cooper (hurdler) (1940\u20131974), British athlete", "* John Cooper (tennis) (born 1946), Australian tennis player", "* John Cooper (basketball) (born 1969), head men's basketball coach at Miami University", "* John Cooper (priest) (died 1896), Archdeacon of Westmorland", "* John Cooper (Archdeacon of Aston) (born 1933), British Anglican priest", "* John Cooper (serial killer) (born 1944), serial killer from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire", "* John Cooper (Southland), a character on Southland", "* John Cooper, a character in Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive", "* John Cooper Clarke, English performance poet"]}, {"page": "Milford Haven", "response": ["Milford Haven is the birthplace of serial killer John Cooper, who in 2011 was convicted of murdering siblings Richard and Helen Thomas at their Scoveston home near Steynton in 1985, and Peter and Gwenda Dixon on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path near Little Haven in 1989.\"John Cooper Guilty Of Two Pembrokeshire Double Murders\", BBC News, 26 May 2011'Jealousy After Cooper's \u00a394,000 Spot The Ball Win', Milford Mercury, 11 May 2011 He was additionally convicted of the rape of a teenager and assault of four others in woodland near the town's Mount Estate in 1996.\"John Cooper Trial: Murder Jury Hears Of Knife Rape\", BBC News, 12 April 2011"]}, {"page": "List of serial killers by country", "response": ["*John Cooper: known as \"The Wildman\" and \"The Bullseye Killer\"; Pembrokeshire burglar responsible for the robbery and shotgun double-murders of a brother and sister in 1985 and a couple in 1989; sentenced to life imprisonment."]}, {"page": "Bullseye (British game show)", "response": ["In 1989, John Cooper appeared on the show.
