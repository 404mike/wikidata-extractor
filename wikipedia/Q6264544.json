He initially followed his father's trade, but eventually took up art, coming under the influence of the work of John Wilson Ewbank (c.1779-1847). His earliest works were exhibited in Newcastle and attracted attention; he followed up this initial success with a large picture called  A View of the Port of Tyne. In 1831 he exhibited some watercolours, again in Newcastle, of which one, The Juicy Tree Bit, was thought the best in the rooms. In collaboration with John Wilson Carmichael he painted The Heroic Exploit of Admiral Collingwood at Trafalgar."]}, {"page": "John Ewbank", "response": ["*John Wilson Ewbank, English painter"]}, {"page": "John W.
