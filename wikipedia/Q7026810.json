After playing on the ATP tour in the early 1980s, but tiring of his financial situation, he left the tour in 1984 to devote his time to coaching in Belgium and France and then young British players at David Lloyd's club in London, including Tim Henman.  Five years later, Brown came out of retirement to play in the Davis Cup.Brown caused a sensation at Wimbledon in 1991 when he was granted a wild card. Ranked No. 591 in the world at the time, he faced the 10th seed and previous year's semi-finalist Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 in the second round and beat him in four sets, to the delight of the British crowd. Brown became the first Briton to beat a seeded player at Wimbledon since John Lloyd beat Eliot Teltscher in 1985. Brown was one of only five British players to beat a player inside the top 15 in a slam since 1990 until Daniel Evans at the 2013 US Open. The other four were Jeremy Bates, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski and Andy Murray. \nBrown eventually lost in the third round to France's Thierry Champion.\nBrown's career-high rankings were world No. 145 in singles and No. 42 in doubles.\nSince permanently retiring from competitive tennis, Brown has served as coach of Britain's Fed Cup team.\nIn 2010, Brown was the Polish Davis Cup and Olympic tennis coach.He has been married to Suzanne Charlton, the weather forecaster and daughter of Bobby Charlton, since 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107", "response": ["| Andrew Castle Nick Brown"]}, {"page": "Eurosport", "response": ["For tennis, studio presentation for the Australian Open, French Open, U.S. Open and WTA Tour Championships on British Eurosport is hosted by Annabel Croft with the segment Hawk-Eye presented by former British number 2 Jason Goodall.
