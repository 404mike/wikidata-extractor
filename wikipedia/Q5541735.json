After leaving Crewe Alexandra, Smith spent almost his entire playing career with Bolton Wanderers, for whom he signed in 1908, either as an inside or centre-forward. Wanderers won the Second Division title in 1908\u201309, but were immediately relegated out of the First Division in 1909\u201310. They regained their top-flight status after securing a second-place finish in the Second Division in 1910\u201311. Smith then became the club's top-scorer in 1911\u201312 with 24 goals, as Bolton posted a fourth-place finish, six points behind champions Blackburn Rovers. He scored 22 goals in 1912\u201313, as Bolton dropped to eighth position. George Lillycrop then became the club's leading scorer in 1913\u201314, before Smith finished as the club's top-scorer for the third time in four seasons with 36 goals in 1914\u201315.

After their opening two fixtures brought criticism of the forwards, Barnsley omitted George Travers for the visit to Birmingham, moved George Lillycrop across to inside right, and gave Cornock his Football League debut at centre forward. Having justified his selection with two goals in a 3\u20131 win, he kept his place for five of the next six matches, and scored three more goals, but after two further appearances without scoring, Travers returned to the side and remained in it. Cornock was included in the 13-man training squad that prepared for FA Cup matches as Barnsley went on to win the competition, but did not make the team, although he did make a further six appearances in league competition. Barnsley chose not to retain Cornock's services, and he moved on to Midland League club Castleford Town."]}, {"page": "Lillycrop", "response": ["* George Lillycrop (1886 \u2013 after 1944), English football player and manager"]}, {"page": "Lillycrop, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Lillycrop"]}]}}
