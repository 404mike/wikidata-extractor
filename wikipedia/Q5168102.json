He was also a gifted amateur sportsman who played first-class cricket for several County Championship sides and competed to a high level in rackets and golf.\nHedley was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1884. He became a surveyor in the 1890s and was attached to the Ordnance Survey. This work was interrupted by service in South Africa throughout the Second Boer War, and from 1906 to 1908 by his appointment as an advisor to the Survey of India. In 1911 he was appointed to command MO4, also known as the Geographical Section of the General Staff. During the First World War this organisation was responsible for producing all the maps required by British Empire forces around the world, and in particular mapping the ever-changing trench system on the Western Front. Following the end of the war, he retired from the army in 1920. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and served on the society's council.\nHedley's first-class cricket career began in 1888 with the Gentlemen of England and Kent County Cricket Club. The majority of his county matches were for Somerset County Cricket Club whom he first represented in 1886 in non-first-class games. His first County Championship games for them were in 1892, and he had a regular place in the side from June of that year. Hedley was also a useful rackets player\u2014reaching the final of the amateur championships, held at the Queen's Club, in 1890. In later life he turned to golf, playing off a scratch handicap.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1937", "response": ["* December 27 \u2013 Sir Coote Hedley, British army officer and sportsman (b. 1865)"]}, {"page": "Charles Close", "response": ["Close served as head of MO4, the Geographical Section of the General Staff, at the War Office until 1911, when he handed over to Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Coote Hedley."]}, {"page": "1937 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 27 December \u2013 Sir Coote Hedley, army officer and sportsman (born 1865)"]}, {"page": "James Fellowes (cricketer)", "response": ["He was employed by the Ordnance Survey in Southampton and in March 1883 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.Meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Astronomical register, vol. 21, pp. 75\u201382, 9 March 1883.
