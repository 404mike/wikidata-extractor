She read archaeology at Newnham College, Cambridge in the 1930s. The university did not allow women to take degrees at that time, and she received her MA in 1948. After the Second World War she worked at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge before moving back to Ulverston in 1953.\n\nIn 1949 she worked on Grahame Clark's excavations at the Star Carr Mesolithic site in Yorkshire. \nAround the same time she began studying the Langdale axe industry in Cumbria, the project for which she is perhaps best remembered. She was not the first person to notice that Neolithic axes had been produced in Great Langdale, but she was able to demonstrate the scale of the activity there, and used the word \"factory\" to describe it. She also guessed correctly that other quarries would be found on outcrops of volcanic tuff in the Lake District.\nFell kept up to date with scientific advances and collaborated with Winifred Pennington in the study of the effects of humans on the environment, resulting in pioneering pollen analyses for prehistoric artefact layers from sites in Cumbria.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Langdale axe industry", "response": ["The Langdale axe industry is the name given by archaeologists to specialised stone tool manufacturing centred at Great Langdale in England's Lake District during the Neolithic period (beginning about 4000\u00a0BC in Britain). The existence of a production site was originally suggested by chance discoveries in the 1930s, which were followed by more systematic searching in the 1940s and 1950s by Clare Fell and others. The finds were mainly reject axes, rough-outs and blades created by knapping large lumps of the rock found in the scree or perhaps by simple quarrying or opencast mining. Hammerstones have also been found in the scree and other lithic debitage from the industry such as blades and flakes.", "*Clare Fell, The Great Langdale stone-axe factory, Trans Cumberland and Westmorland Antiand Arch Soc, 50, 1-13 (1950)."]}, {"page": "Grahame Clark", "response": ["With his project at Star Carr completed, Clark returned his attention to the excavation of the Iron Age settlement at Micklemoor Hill.
