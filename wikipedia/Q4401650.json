She is best known for her activism for increased opportunities for women's education and employment.\nBorn into a wealthy merchant family in Russia, she moved to England as a young girl and remained there for most of her life. She devoted her time to social activism and used her wealth to fund numerous women's causes. She began her activism in the Anglican deaconess movement in the 1860s. There she organized members and raised awareness of the goals of the movement.\nHubbard then began promoting elementary education as a career for women. Hubbard capitalized on increased awareness of the demand for elementary teachers. She then helped to establish a college to train women as elementary teachers. She was concerned that many women were unable to find work as teachers due to poor educational practices. After establishing the college for teachers, she began promoting other careers for women. Hubbard spent much of her life promoting employment opportunities for women who had to work to support themselves. She particularly focused on unmarried women and impoverished gentlewomen and the disdain in which society held the idea of their employment.\nShe also published several pamphlets and newspapers that argued in favour of educating and providing employment for women. She published A Handbook for Women's Work, later known as The Englishwoman's Yearbook, from 1875 to 1889. She also published The Woman's Gazette, later known as Work and Leisure, from 1875 until 1893. Hubbard initially contributed most of the articles to the publications and later served as editor. Though they became well known, they were mostly unprofitable and Hubbard was forced to subsidise them with her personal wealth. Hubbard also established the Women's Emigration Society to help single women find work overseas after she learned of the job opportunities that were available in the British Colonies. She also helped organise other groups that promoted emigration.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1800\u20131874||data-sort-value=\"Hubbard, Louisa\"|Louisa Hubbard||United Kingdom||1836||1906||||"]}, {"page": "University of Chichester", "response": ["In 1873, the campus became a training institute for women teachers due to the activism of Louisa Hubbard after the Elementary Education Act 1870 which created demand for school teachers.

That year she also wrote A Handbook for Nursing the Sick, which was well received by her fellow nurses. In 1873 she became qualified as a midwife.
