He made the accusation at the outset of a House hearing where BP's chief executive officer, Tony Hayward, appeared for the first time before Congress.  Facing Hayward at the witness table, Barton said, \"I apologize. I do not want to live in a country where any time a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong, is subject to some sort of political pressure that is, again, in my words \u2014 amounts to a shakedown, so I apologize.\" Prior to the establishment of the agreement, the Obama administration had been public in their criticism of BP for the oil spill."]}, {"page": "John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley", "response": ["It was announced on 25 July 2006 that Browne would stand down as chief executive of BP in December 2008. There had been press speculation that he had wished to continue beyond this date, but he made it clear that he did not wish to do so. On 6 January 2007, Browne won his first interim injunction against the publication of allegations by his former partner, Jeff Chevalier. Browne later disclosed being \"terrified\" that his sexuality would be revealed publicly. A week later it was announced that his retirement date had been brought forward to July 2007 and that Tony Hayward would succeed him.", "According to The Guardian newspaper, \"Browne's reputation was tarnished by a string of accidents in the US which hastened his retirement\", and Browne declined to appear in an hour-long BBC2 documentary on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in which Tony Hayward was extensively interviewed, broadcast in November 2010."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom\u2013United States relations", "response": ["In April 2010, the explosion, sinking and resultant oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig led to diplomatic friction and populist anti-British sentiment, even though the rig was owned and operated by the Swiss company Transocean and the cement work carried out by the US company Halliburton . Commentators referred to \"British Petroleum\" even though the company had been known as \"BP\" since 1998. UK politicians expressed concerns about anti-British rhetoric in the US. BP's CEO Tony Hayward was called \"the most hated man in America\". Conversely, the widespread public demonisation of BP and the effects on the company and its image, coupled with Obama's statements with regard to BP caused a degree of anti-American sentiment in the UK. This was particularly evidenced by the comments of the Business Secretary Vince Cable, who said that \"It's clear that some of the rhetoric in the US is extreme and unhelpful\", for reasons of British pension funds, loss of revenues for the exchequer and the adverse effect such the rhetoric was having on the share price of one of the UK's largest companies."]}, {"page": "The Andrew Marr Show", "response": ["Notable interviewees included: Dmitry Medvedev (then President of Russia), Morgan Tsvangirai (then Prime Minister of Zimbabwe), Tony Hayward (then CEO of BP), Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Ban Ki-moon (UN Secretary-General), Michael Caine, Kevin Rudd (then Prime Minister of Australia), David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson."]}, {"page": "Nathaniel Philip Rothschild", "response": ["In June 2011, Rothschild and Tony Hayward, the former chief executive of BP plc, listed a successor vehicle to Vallar called Vallares (LSE:VLRS) on the London Stock Exchange, raising $2.2\u00a0billion.
