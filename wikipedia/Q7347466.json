They worked on the chemical composition of the human body, and on the nutritional value of different flours used to make bread. Widdowson also studied the impact of infant diet on human growth. They studied the differing effects from deficiencies of salt and of water and produced the first tables to compare the nutritional contents of foods before and after cooking. They co-authored The Chemical Composition of Foods, first published in 1940 by the Medical Research Council. Their book, \"McCance and Widdowson\", became known as the dietician's bible and formed the basis for modern nutritional thinking."]}, {"page": "Royal Naval Air Service", "response": ["* Robert McCance \u2013 later Professor of Experimental Medicine, Cambridge University"]}, {"page": "1940 in science", "response": ["* Robert McCance and Elsie Widdowson publish the standard text The Chemical Composition of Foods."]}, {"page": "King's College Hospital", "response": ["* Robert McCance (1898-1993) Effects of salt deficiency, iron regulation mechanism, The Chemical Composition of Foods, modern nutrition"]}, {"page": "Rationing in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In December 1939, Elsie Widdowson and Robert McCance of the University of Cambridge tested whether the United Kingdom could survive with only domestic food production if U-boats ended all imports. Using 1938 food production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers one egg,  of meat and  of fish a week;  of milk a day;  of margarine; and unlimited amounts of potatoes, vegetables and wholemeal bread. Two weeks of intensive outdoor exercise simulated the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months; the only negative results were the increased time needed for meals to consume the necessary calories from bread and potatoes, and what they described as a \"remarkable\" increase in flatulence from the large amount of starch in the diet. The scientists also noted that their faeces had increased by 250% in volume."]}, {"page": "Elsie Widdowson", "response": ["Elsie Widdowson  (21 October 1906 \u2013 14 June 2000), was a British dietitian and nutritionist.

McCance was a junior doctor researching the chemical effects of cooking as part of his clinical research on the treatment of diabetes. Widdowson pointed out an error in McCance's analysis of the fructose content of fruit, based on her PhD research. Instead of being offended, McCance obtained a grant for Widdowson to analyze and correct all previous data. From there on they became scientific partners and worked together for the next 60 years, until McCance died in 1993. A few years after the first grant, McCance obtained a second grant for Widdowson to continue working on the food composition of fruits, vegetables, and nuts."]}, {"page": "List of Old St. Beghians", "response": ["* Robert McCance (1898\u20131993), Professor of Experimental Medicine, Cambridge University."]}, {"page": "McCance", "response": ["*Robert McCance (1898\u20131993), British academic"]}, {"page": "Robert Alexander McCance", "response": ["#REDIRECTRobert McCance"]}, {"page": "Neonatal Society", "response": ["Previous presidents include David Hull, Robert McCance, Peter Tizard, Elsie Widdowson, Maureen Young, Andrew Wilkinson and, the current president-elect of the British Medical Association, Neena Modi."]}]}}
