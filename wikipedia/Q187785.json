Trump said afterwards \"It's probably the worst I've played all tournament. I would've probably expected to lose to anyone the way I played.\"", "Trump was thrashed 0\u20135 by Stephen Maguire in the third round of the Wuxi Classic, but responded a week later by claiming his fourth ranking title, and his first for 20 months, at the Australian Goldfields Open, by defeating home favourite Neil Robertson 9\u20135 in the final. He reached the final of the Paul Hunter Classic but lost 2\u20134 to Mark Allen. He then suffered first and second round exits to Dominic Dale and Jamie Burnett respectively in the next two ranking events. He advanced to the final of the Champion of Champions but fell 3\u20138 down to Ronnie O'Sullivan, before reducing his deficit to a single frame by taking four successive frames with the help of two centuries. However, O'Sullivan won the two frames he needed to triumph 10\u20137, with Trump claiming his opponent's standard of play throughout the match was the best he had ever encountered. The pair also met in the final of the UK Championship in which Trump was 4\u20139 behind with a highest break of just 56. However, he won the 14th frame and then made back-to-back centuries and a break of 86 to only trail 8\u20139. He was 0\u201359 down in the next frame, but cleared the table with a 67 break to send the match into an unlikely decider; O'Sullivan then made a title-winning break after Trump had failed to escape from a snooker. O'Sullivan afterwards described the match as the hardest of his career. At the Masters, Trump lost 4\u20136 against Stephen Maguire in the first round. He made the second 147 of his career in the quarter-finals of the German Masters, but was knocked out 4\u20135 by Mark Selby."]}, {"page": "2005 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["|   Andy Hicks 10\u20135  Dominic Dale"]}, {"page": "2004 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["|   Dominic Dale 10\u20138  Leo Fernandez"]}, {"page": "2002 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["James Wattana won only one frame of his match against John Higgins.
