The weekend schedule was also adjusted at this time, with Rick Shaw moving to present the Weekend Morning Show on Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 2 pm and Lliana Bird taking over the afternoon slots.

She had tried to do the two together but realised that she could not give her full attention to both.

According to Garvey the song is about \"missing my friends that have dropped out of the drinking culture that we all met in, or moved away, or died\". The lyrics for \"New York Morning\" were adapted from one of Garvey's diary entries about a trip he and Unsworth made to New York City. In an interview on radio station XFM on 24 January 2014, he told presenter Jo Good that the lyrics were \"pretty much verbatim, 6 o'clock in the morning, in Manhattan in the Moonstruck Caf\u00e9 [named after the 1987 film Moonstruck], it's verbatim how I was feeling as the city was waking up\". The track was called \"The City\" for a short while, until Elbow realised the implications of such a name in their home city of Manchester, where the two rival football teams of Manchester United and Manchester City are often referred to as simply \"United\" and \"City\", and the band could have been accused of being partisan. Garvey spent a large part of 2012 in New York while working on the King Kong musical, and he told Q magazine that the time he had spent in the city had been a big influence on the album, saying, \"I'm having an intense love affair with Brooklyn. One overarching theme on this record is me flitting between Manchester and New York.\""]}, {"page": "Billy Bibby & The Wry Smiles", "response": ["Billy Bibby & The Wry Smiles released their debut single \"Waitin' for You\" on 3 November 2015.
