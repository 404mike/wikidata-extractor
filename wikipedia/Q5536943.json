After a visit by Lindsey in 1841, George Cruikshank wrote to Charles Dickens (who had given Lindsey a note of introduction) to comment that his wife had at first thought Lindsey \"either drunk or mad\". As a consequence, his public life was very limited, although on 10 August 1849, he was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire.
