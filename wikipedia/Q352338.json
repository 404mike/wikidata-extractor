He is widely acknowledged to have been one of the sport's greatest-ever players. He was noted for his loyalty to Preston, for whom he made 569 first-class appearances, and for many outstanding performances in international matches.\nIn later life, Finney was club president of both Preston and of non-league Kendal Town F.C. For his charitable work, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1961 Birthday Honours and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1992 New Year Honours and was knighted in the 1998 New Year Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 5", "response": ["*1922 \u2013 Tom Finney, English footballer (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "Bobby Charlton", "response": ["Charlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4\u20130, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger Tom Finney.

Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection. A hat-trick in the 8\u20131 rout of Switzerland in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the record jointly held by Tom Finney and Nat Lofthouse; Charlton's 31st goal against Wales in October the same year gave him the record alone."]}, {"page": "England national football team", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left\"|Tom Finney"]}, {"page": "February 14", "response": ["*2014 \u2013 Tom Finney, English footballer (b. 1922)"]}, {"page": "Wallace and Gromit", "response": ["In the Cracking Contraptions episode \"The Soccamatic\", Wallace says to Gromit, \"How do you like my Preston North End soccamatic, Gromit?\".

By 1949, he was Preston's club captain but had lost his place in the first team, which was struggling against relegation despite having Tom Finney in the side.Kelly, p. 57. Shankly was a qualified masseur and had decided he wanted to become a coach so, when Carlisle United asked him to become their manager in March of that year, he retired as a player and accepted the job.Shankly, pp. 59\u201360. Shankly's departure from Preston was resented by some at the club and he was refused a benefit match, to which he felt entitled. He described Preston's attitude as the biggest let-down of his life in football.Shankly, p. 60.", "Shankly had enormous admiration for Tom Finney and devotes more than three pages of his autobiography to Finney's prowess as a footballer.Shankly, pp. 44\u201347. In the 1970s, Shankly was asked how a current star compared to Finney and Shankly replied: \"Aye, he's as good as Tommy \u2013 but then Tommy's nearly 60 now\".When Saturday Comes \u2013 The Half Decent Football Book, p. 143. Another Preston player admired by Shankly was his Scottish international teammate Andy Beattie, with whom he would later work in management.Shankly, p. 47. Shankly was succeeded in the Preston team by Tommy Docherty and Shankly told Docherty that he should just put the number four shirt on and let it run round by itself because it knows where to go.", "Melwood was overgrown and had only an old wooden cricket pavilion.Kelly, p. 142. Shankly commented that one of the pitches looked as if bombs had been dropped on it and he asked if the Germans had been over in the war.Shankly, p. 87. He instituted a development programme to cultivate the site and modernise the facilities. In the meantime, he arranged for the players to meet and change at Anfield before going to and from Melwood by bus. According to Kelly, Liverpool's eventual success was based on hard work done in the training system that Shankly, Paisley, Fagan and Bennett introduced at Melwood. Shankly deplored long distance running on roads and insisted that, apart from warm-up exercises or any special exercises needed to overcome injuries, the players trained on grass using a ball. Everything was done systematically with players rotating through exercise routines in groups with the purpose of achieving set targets. These would first cycle through athletic exercises, like skipping or squats, before moving on to football-specific functions, such as a heading the ball or chipping it. Five-a-side games, as at all Shankly's earlier clubs, were at the heart of the system and he again insisted on these being as competitive as league matches.Kelly, p. 145. One particular routine designed to develop stamina, reflexes and ball skills was the \"sweat box\" which Shankly described as: \"using boards like the walls of a house with players playing the ball off one wall and on to the next; the ball was played against the boards, you controlled it, turned around and took it again\".Shankly, p. 96. Shankly got the idea from a routine he had seen Tom Finney use at Preston to hone his skills. After experimenting with the routine, he set the players a limit of two minutes per session. The system was geared to Shankly's simple philosophy of \"pass and move\", which formed the basis of Liverpool's strategy.Shankly, pp. 96\u201397. Shankly insisted on suitable cooling-off periods after training (now called \"warming down\") before the players took a bath and had a meal. The team changed the studs in their boots to suit all playing conditions. Shankly summarised the entire strategy in terms of attention to detail with nothing left to chance.Shankly, p. 100.", "Liverpool improved their league performances over the next two years, finishing third in 1967\u201368 and then second in 1968\u201369, although to Shankly himself it was \"a mediocre time in the late 1960s as we prepared for the 1970s\".Shankly, p. 109. Shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped. In 1967, he signed striker Tony Hateley from Chelsea for a club record \u00a396,000 and then felt obliged to transfer him to Coventry City only a year later. He wrote that bad luck and injuries disrupted the progress of two other prospects Alf Arrowsmith and Gordon Wallace; Shankly had compared the latter to Tom Finney.Shankly, p. 110. In September 1968, he paid \u00a3100,000 ()to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their teenage striker Alun Evans who thus became \"football's first \u00a3100,000 teenager\". Evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at the club but Shankly eventually had to sell him to Aston Villa. He later recalled that Evans was scarred by a glass in a nightclub incident which, in Shankly's opinion, had a detrimental impact on his career.Shankly, pp. 110\u2013111."]}]}}
