There he became a vigorous campaigner for free trade, and was a co-founder of the Free Trade and Liberal Association in that colony, the body that would later become the machine behind the Free Trade Party. Although his attempts to enter the New South Wales Legislative Assembly were abortive, he was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1895 and served until 1901, when he was elected to the Senate. An uncompromising opponent of all forms of protectionism, following the 1909 Fusion of the anti-Labour forces he joined the Liberal Party only with reluctance.\nPulsford is also remembered for his avid opposition to the White Australia policy and other forms of racial discrimination. Whilst financial editor of the Daily Telegraph he attacked restrictive immigration laws, and he fought against the policy in the state parliament and later in the Senate, where he was one of the few to oppose the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act. This racial tolerance, combined with his opposition to women's suffrage, has led the economist John Hawkins to describe him as \"probably the least racist but perhaps the most sexist member of the Australian Senate in its first decade\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Candidates of the 1901 Australian federal election", "response": ["| |Mark HammondJohn KiddKenneth MackaySir William ManningRichard O'Connor*George Waddell || |Albert Gould*John GrayEdward Millen*John Neild*Edward Pulsford*James Walker* || Donald MacdonellSamuel Smith || Harry HollandThomas MellingJames MoroneyJames MorrishJohn NeillAndrew Thomson || Francis Abigail (Ind FT)Andrew Armstrong (Ind FT)John Blake (Ind)Francis Brown (Ind)Richard Colonna-Close (Ind Prot)John Cook (Ind)Francis Cotton (Ind FT)George Cox (Ind FT)Thomas Edwards (Ind)David Fealy (Ind Prot)William Flynn (Ind)David Gash (Ind)Eden George (Ind Prot)William Gocher (Ind)John Griffin (Ind FT) || Harry Lassetter (Ind FT)Patrick Lynch (Ind Prot)Richard Meagher (Ind Prot)James Moriarty (Ind FT)John Norton (Ind Prot)Denis O'Sullivan (Ind)Walter Quinn (Ind Prot)William Read (Ind Prot)William Richardson (Ind Prot)Sam Rosa (Ind FT)Charles Royle (Ind FT)William Shipway (Ind FT)Edward Terry (Ind FT)Lindsay Thompson (Ind FT)Harrie Wood (Ind Prot)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1903 Australian federal election", "response": ["| Nathaniel CollinsJohn Cunneen || |John Gray*John Neild*Edward Pulsford* || Arthur Griffith || Herbert DrakeJames MoroneyAndrew Thomson || Mary Moore-Bentley (Ind)Henry Fletcher (Ind)Nellie Martel (Ind FT)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1906 Australian federal election", "response": ["Three seats were up for election.

In 1903 Foxall, financed by the wealthy Free Trade MP Bruce Smith, published Colorphobia: An Exposure of the White Australia Fallacy, in which he sharply criticised the political orthodoxy surrounding White Australia as based on racial prejudice and especially decried Free Traders who supported the Immigration Restriction Act despite its clear anti-free trade implications. Although his views were supported by a small number of federal politicians, including Smith and Senator Edward Pulsford, Foxall's opposition to White Australia placed him squarely outside the political orthodoxy.
