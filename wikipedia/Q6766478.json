So it takes a lot to get my attention.  His melodies are original, his vocals warm and distinctive, a real musical sensibility is obvious, with literary lyrics to boot.  My vote for one of the best of the new generation'.His song \"Summerbreeze\" has enjoyed several releases, and was recorded by Emiliana Torrini for her album, Love in the Time of Science.  \"Summerbreeze\" has  been featured on television programmes including Brothers & Sisters, Secret Diary of a Call Girl, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
