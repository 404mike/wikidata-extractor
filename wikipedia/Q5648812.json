Although Cowley's plays and poetry did not enjoy wide popularity after the 19th century, critic Melinda Finberg rates her as \"one of the foremost playwrights of the late eighteenth century\" whose \"skill in writing fluid, sparkling dialogue and creating sprightly, memorable comic characters compares favourably with her better-known contemporaries, Goldsmith and Sheridan.\"Melinda C. Finberg, ed., Introduction. Eighteenth-Century Women Dramatists.  Oxford/New York: Oxford UP, 2001, pp. xxxv\u2013xxxvi. Cowley's plays were produced frequently in her lifetime. The major themes of her plays \u2013 including her first, The Runaway (1776), and her major success, which is being revived, The Belle's Stratagem (1780) \u2013 revolve around marriage and how women strive to overcome the injustices imposed by family life and social custom.", "Born Hannah Parkhouse, she was the daughter of Hannah (n\u00e9e Richards) and Philip Parkhouse, a bookseller in Tiverton, Devon.

On 10 August, More wrote to the St. James Chronicle to protest that she \"never saw, heard, or read, a single line of Mrs. Cowley's Tragedy.\" In her preface to Albina, Cowley allows that the theatre managers, who in those days doubled as script editors, may have inadvertently given More her ideas: \"Amidst the croud of Plots, and Stage Contrivances, in which a Manager is involv'd, recollection is too frequently mistaken for the suggestions of imagination\" [emphasis in original].", "Hannah Cowley had a less distinguished career as a poet, writing The Scottish Village, or Pitcairne Green in 1786, and The Siege of Acre: an Epic Poem in 1801. In the summer of 1787, under the pseudonym \"Anna Matilda,\" she and the poet Robert Merry (writing as Della Crusca) began a poetic correspondence in the pages of the journal The World. Their poems were sentimental and flirtatious. At first each did not even know the other's identity; later they met and became part of a poetic movement called the Della Cruscans. Literary history has not been kind to Della Cruscan poetry, which was criticised as sloppy and emotional. Merry was the subject of a satirical poem, \"The Baviad\", written by a contemporary, William Gifford. Cowley's poetry was published as The Poetry of Anna Matilda [pseud.] Containing A Tale for Jealousy, The Funeral, Her Correspondence with Della Crusca [pseud.] and Several Other Poetical Pieces.
