He stood for the NILP in Belfast Oldpark at the 1938 Northern Ireland general election, taking second place, with 40.8% of the vote.  In 1945, he was appointed Irish Regional Organiser of the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers (NUTGW).Macgougan was Chair of the NILP in 1945\u20131946, but became unhappy with its increasingly unionist stance.  He supported the establishment of the Irish Labour Party in Northern Ireland in 1949, and was elected to Belfast City Council.  He later stood unsuccessfully for the party in South Down at the 1950 general election, and Belfast Falls at the 1953 Northern Ireland general election.  He lost his council seat in 1958.  That year, he served as President of the Irish Trades Union Congress while, in 1965, he was President of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions.  In 1969, he became General Secretary of the UK-wide NUTGW, and also served on the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Labour Party (Ireland)", "response": ["The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 and Ireland Act 1949 precipitated a split in the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) with Jack Macgougan leading anti-Partition members out and affiliating branches to the Dublin party, joined by other left-wing and nationalist representatives and branded locally as \"Irish Labour\". At Westminster, Jack Beattie held Belfast West from 1951 to 1955; the British Labour party refused Beattie its whip. At Stormont, Belfast Dock was won by Murtagh Morgan in 1953 and Paddy Devlin in 1962, but Devlin in 1964 left for the Republican Labour Party and Irish Labour contested no further Westminster or Stormont elections.  In the 1949 local elections it won 7 seats on Belfast City Council, 6 (unopposed) on Armagh urban district council (UDC) and one on Dungannon UDC. In Derry, the party collapsed when Stephen McGonagle left after 1952. It was strongest in Warrenpoint and Newry UDCs, winning control of the former in 1949 and the latter in 1958, retaining seats in both until their 1973 abolition. Tommy Markey was expelled from the party in 1964 for taking a salute as Newry council chair from the Irish Guards. Party branches still existed in Warrenpoint and Newry as late as 1982, though candidates were heavily defeated in Newry and Mourne District Council at the 1973 local elections.The Local Government Elections 1973\u20131981: Newry and Mourne , Northern Ireland Elections The Social Democratic and Labour Party founded in 1970 took most of Irish Labour's voters and soon had its formal endorsement."]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Labour Party", "response": [":1945: Jack Macgougan"]}, {"page": "National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers", "response": [":1969: Jack Macgougan"]}, {"page": "Irish Trades Union Congress", "response": ["|Jack Macgougan"]}, {"page": "Jack MacGougan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Macgougan "]}, {"page": "Socialist Party of Northern Ireland", "response": ["The Belfast Labour Party (BLP) was founded in 1917, and the ILP worked closely with it.

This continued until 1932, when the British ILP disaffiliated from the British Labour Party.
