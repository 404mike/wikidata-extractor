The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004."]}, {"page": "Falkirk Wheel", "response": ["The Morrison-Bachy Soletanche Joint Venture Team submitted their original design, which resembled a Ferris wheel with four gondolas, in 1999. It was agreed by all parties that the design was functional, but not the showpiece the BWB were looking for. After being asked to reconsider, a 20-strong team of architects and engineers was assembled by British Waterways.  Under the leadership of Tony Kettle from architects RMJM, the initial concepts and images were created with the mechanical concepts proposed by the design team from Butterley and M G Bennetts. This was an intense period of work with the final design concept completed in a three-week period during the summer of 1999. The final design was a co-operative effort between the British Waterways Board, engineering consultants Arup, Butterley Engineering and RMJM."]}, {"page": "Arup Group", "response": ["* Lakhta Center, Saint Peterburg, Russia (verification calculation for the underground part, foundation pile base and the superstructure, ongoing, architect: Tony Kettle, RMJM)"]}, {"page": "Dubai International Convention Centre", "response": ["Architect - Tony Kettle"]}, {"page": "Woodhorn (Museum)", "response": ["The museum was first opened in 1989 but following major redevelopment with chief architect Tony Kettle, the museum reopened in October 2006.

Construction of the tower began in 2011 and was completed in late 2014. In 2016, Transneft bought the Evolution Tower for US$1 billion to establish its headquarters.

The design is similar to the double helix-shape of DNA.
