The purpose of the enterprise was the enlightenment of the local lower classes. Daisy commented on the coming endeavour in a 1911 letter to R. D. Blumenfeld with: \"We shall be a little group of the Salt of the Earth in the Dunmow District soon!\" Conrad Noel, the 'Red Vicar' of Thaxted, whom Daisy had appointed to his incumbency, was a critical supporter stating that this \"...smacked of [the] Bloomsbury\" set. Members of Cecil Sharp's English Folk Dance Society performed at the inaugural event at The Barn Theatre and Sharp noted that Daisy's vote of thanks contained a vision of \"merry dancers on village greens and the people of Easton dancing to meet the people of Dunmow\". Those who contributed and gravitated to be entertained in the 'Warwick Circle' were fellow socialist political proponents and literary figures, including H. G.
