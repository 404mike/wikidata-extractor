Anderson was baptized at St Luke\u2019s church in Carluke, Scotland on 26 May 1799.\nAnderson was employed as a stocking weaver but played draughts as a hobby. By the early 1820s he was considered the best draughts player in Scotland and was regularly challenged by foreign players.\nOne player, James Wylie, known as the \u2018Herd Laddie\u2019 was Anderson's strongest opponent.  Over a period of nine years, the two men played five matches. The first match was played in 1838 in Edinburgh for \u00a310, with Anderson the winner.  The second match was held in 1840, again in Edinburgh, for \u00a340 with Anderson the winner.  In 1840, the men played aa third match in the Clydesdale Hotel, Lanark for \u00a3100, with Anderson the winner. The fourth match was held in 1844 in Carluke for \u00a3130, with Wyllie the winner.  The newspapers attributed Anderson's loss to the death of his wife, but in reality, she had died two years earlier. The last match was played in 1847 in the Robin Hood Tavern of Edinburgh for \u00a340, with Anderson the winner. After this last match, Anderson retired from match play.\nAfter his retirement from draughts, Anderson published several books on the game. Anderson\u2019s guide to the game of draughts was published in Lanark in 1848. A second book The game of draughts simplified was published in 1852, often referred to as the \u201csecond edition\u201d. In this book; Anderson established the rules of draughts and standardised the method of recording moves. With the help of John Drummond, the book recorded and fixed the names of all opening moves, with names such as the \u2018Old Fourteenth\u2019 and the \u2018Maid of the Mill\u2019.\nAnderson died 1 March 1861 leaving behind five sons; William, James, John, George and Andrew. He is buried along with his wife in St Luke\u2019s Cemetery, in Carluke.
