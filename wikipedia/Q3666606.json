Among the most decisive events for his creative life, a sexual assault in Italy upon his girlfriend in 1975 \u2014 which he witnessed at gunpoint \u2014 formed the material for some of the poems in This Other Life (1988) and provided the plot outline for a novel called September in the Rain published in September 2016.", "Alongside his poetry, Peter Robinson's ancillary activities have also received widespread critical attention. The translations of Vittorio Sereni, made in collaboration with Marcus Perryman, were described by Charles Tomlinson in The Independent (1990) as 'versions that possess an uncanny accuracy, true to the fragmented, self-communing, smouldering and combustible humanity of Sereni's work'. Choosing The Great Friend and Other Translated Poems (2002) as a Poetry Book Society Recommended Translation, Douglas Dunn wrote that 'the range is eclectic without being scattered confusingly across too many languages and cultures. For me at least, much of this work is new' while Glyn Pursglove, reviewing the book in Acumen, found that Robinson's 'attempted fidelity is not allowed to distort his own use of English and English verse and there is a great deal to admire and enjoy here. Indeed, one could wish the book a good deal longer.' John Welle called the translations of Luciano Erba (2007) 'marvellously attuned ... accurate, carefully crafted, and in harmony with the idiom and spirit of the originals.' They were awarded the 2008 John Florio Prize."]}, {"page": "Cholmondeley Award", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson"]}, {"page": "Encounter (magazine)", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson (10)"]}, {"page": "Attilio Bertolucci", "response": ["Selections of his poetry has been translated into English by Charles Tomlinson and Allen Prowle."]}, {"page": "Burslem School of Art", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson, poet and artist"]}, {"page": "1997 in poetry", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson, Selected Poems 1955\u20131997"]}, {"page": "1995 in poetry", "response": ["*Charles Tomlinson, Jubilation"]}, {"page": "1992 in poetry", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson, The Door in the Wall"]}, {"page": "1989 in poetry", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson, Annunciations"]}, {"page": "1987 in poetry", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson, The Return"]}, {"page": "1984 in poetry", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson, Notes from New York; and Other Poems"]}, {"page": "1980 in poetry", "response": ["* Charles Tomlinson, editor, The Oxford Book of Verse in English translation"]}, {"page": "1979 in poetry", "response": ["* Cholmondeley Award: Alan Brownjohn, Andrew Motion, Charles Tomlinson"]}]}}
