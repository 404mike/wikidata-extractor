She is known for her collection of rubbings of Celtic crosses and Pictish stones from across Scotland, and was a pioneer of stratigraphic excavation. Although she lost the use of her right hand due to a medical condition she nevertheless produced numerous drawings, sketches and paintings with her left hand. She took action to help those affected by poverty in Stirling. She refused to sit for portraits although one obituary described her as tall. She was a suffragist. She wrote an autobiography but the script remains lost. She was nominated to be one of Scotland's Heroines honoured at the National Wallace Monument's Hall of Heroes. She died in Ravenscroft, Stirling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stirling", "response": ["* Christian Maclagan \u2013 Sunday School teacher, antiquarian, early archaeologist, and suffragist"]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1800\u20131874||data-sort-value=\"Maclagan, Christian\"|Christian Maclagan||United Kingdom||1811||1901||||"]}, {"page": "Bennachie", "response": ["*Christian Maclagan"]}, {"page": "Stratigraphy (archaeology)", "response": ["*Christian Maclagan"]}, {"page": "Denny, Falkirk", "response": ["* Christian Maclagan, archaeologist"]}, {"page": "1901 in archaeology", "response": ["* May 10 \u2013 Christian Maclagan, Scottish antiquary (b. 1811)"]}, {"page": "1811 in archaeology", "response": ["* Christian Maclagan, Scottish antiquary (d. 1901)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Gaelic-speaking people", "response": ["* Christian Maclagan"]}, {"page": "Christian (given name)", "response": ["*Christian Maclagan (1811\u20131901) Scottish Antiquarian"]}, {"page": "Easter Aquhorthies stone circle", "response": ["The placename Aquhorthies derives from a Scottish Gaelic word meaning \"field of prayer\", and may indicate a \"long continuity of sanctity\" between the Stone or Bronze Age circle builders and their much later Gaelic successors millennia later. The circle's surroundings were landscaped in the late 19th century, and it sits within a small fenced and walled enclosure. A stone dyke, known as a roundel, was built around the circle some time between 1847 and 1866\u20137. The circle was subsequently brought to wider public attention in the 1870s and 1880s by a series of paintings, drawings and descriptions, though some were far-fetched, such as Christian Maclagan's reconstruction of the circle as a kind of broch. In 1884 it attracted the attention of the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, and five years later his assistants William Tomkin and Claude Gray visited the site to measure, document and photograph it in order to build a scale model (which is now part of the collection of The Salisbury Museum in Wiltshire)."]}, {"page": "1901 in Scotland", "response": ["* 10 May \u2013 Christian Maclagan, antiquary (born 1811)"]}, {"page": "1811 in Scotland", "response": ["* Christian Maclagan, antiquary (died 1901)"]}, {"page": "List of women anthropologists", "response": ["| Christian Maclagan"]}, {"page": "TrowelBlazers", "response": ["* Christian Maclagan"]}, {"page": "Aquhorthies stone circle", "response": ["The antiquarian James Garden visited in 1692 on the insistence of John Aubrey but his report confuses the site with the Auld Bourtreebush stone circle in the next field.

It was excavated in 1858 by James Dyce Nicol, Charles Dalrymple, James Nicolson, Captain James Burnett, the Reverend Harry Stuart and Alexander Thomson. The cairn had already been plundered and they discovered some burnt bone fragments and pottery sherds. In the late nineteenth century the circle was visited by among others William Collings Lukis, Christian Maclagan, Robert Angus Smith, William Tomkin and Frederick Coles. Alexander Keiller noted in 1934 that there was an atypical number of stones and that their heights alternated. Alexander Thom surveyed the site in 1955 and Clive Ruggles checked for archaeoastrological alignments in 1981. A geological survey was carried out in 2006."]}]}}
