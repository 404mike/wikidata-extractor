Until 2001 he was Professor of Software Engineering at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory, where he was also a Fellow of Kellogg College. He then joined the University of Kent and is now based at the University of York, where, since October 2012, he has been head of the Department of Computer Science.\nHis research interests include: strong software engineering, Grand Challenge in dependable systems evolution, unifying theories of programming, formal specification, refinement, concurrency, state-rich systems, mobile and reconfigurable processes, nanotechnology, Grand Challenge in the railway domain. He has a background in formal methods, especially the Z notation and CSP.\nWoodcock worked on applying the Z notation to the IBM CICS project, helping to gain a Queen's Award for Technological Achievement, and Mondex, helping to gain the highest ITSEC classification level.Prof. Woodcock is Editor-in-Chief of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mondex", "response": ["The Z notation was used to prove security properties about Mondex, allowing it to achieve ITSEC level E6, ITSEC's highest granted security-level classification.Susan Stepney, David Cooper, and Jim Woodcock, An Electronic Purse: Specification, Refinement, and Proof.Technical Monograph PRG-126, Programming Research Group, Oxford University, UK, 2000.Jim Woodcock, Susan Stepney, David Cooper, John Clark, and Jeremy Jacob, The certification of the Mondex electronic purse to ITSEC Level E6, Formal Aspects of Computing, Volume 20, Number 1, pages 5\u201319, January 2008."]}, {"page": "BCS-FACS", "response": ["FACS sponsors and supports meetings, such as the Refinement Workshop.John Derrick, Eerke Boiten, Jim Woodcock and Joakim von Wright (editors), REFINE 2002: The BCS FACS Refinement Workshop.
