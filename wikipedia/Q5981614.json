Helped by 'fellow British' officers, O'Leary escaped in early June 1941. He went to Marseilles where everyone at the Fort knew there was an escape organisation run by a man named Ian Garrow and soon made contact.  At this point his intention was make his way to Gibraltar and resume his original naval service. Events were to dictate otherwise because Garrow wanted O'Leary to stay and help with the organisation since he was a military officer, he had undercover training and unlike Garrow, spoke French fluently. Consequently, a request was sent to London that he stay, which was approved and confirmed by a BBC radio message received on 2 July 1941. Fidelity was lost with all hands when torpedoed in the South Atlantic on 31 December 1942. O'Leary immediately began his job : within a four-month period, he helped about fifty men escape from the prison of St Hippolyte du Fort, then moved them down the line back to England through the Pyrenees."]}, {"page": "Marie-Louise Dissard", "response": ["Marie-Louise Dissard,   (6 November 1881 \u2013 July 1957) (code named \"Fran\u00e7oise\"), was a member of the French Resistance during the German occupation of France in World War II.

The O'Leary Line was first headed by Ian Garrow and later by Albert Gu\u00e9risse. In 1943, after their arrests and the destruction of the O'Leary Line by the German Gestapo, Dissard created an escape network called the Francoise Line.  The Francoise Line helped more than 250 Allied airmen escape occupied France and return to Great Britain.

Garrow was impressed. He gave Lepers 10,000 francs (about $3,700 in 2020 US dollars) for expenses, and when Cole visited Marseilles in February, Garrow named him the head of the Pat line in northern France and gave him another 10,000 francs for expenses. In the following months, Cole and Lepers transported a group of five to ten English soldiers and airmen south to Marseilles every two weeks, for which Cole received reimbursement for the expenses he claimed from Garrow.

He was described as a con man with a string of convictions for housebreaking and fraud, but his background was disregarded because of his efficiency in helping British soldiers. Slowly, however, Garrow and the Pat Line leaders learned that Cole was keeping the expense money paid him in his pocket rather than distributing it to his helpers. Albert Gu\u00e9risse, a Belgian who became the leader of the Pat Line after Ian Garrow was arrested by the Vichy French in October 1941, arranged a meeting on 1 November 1941 with Cole and himself and several leading members of the Pat Line in the Marseilles apartment of Dr. George Rodocanachi. They arrested Cole and confronted him with the evidence of his fraud and double-dealing. They locked him in a bathroom while they debated his fate, with some favoring execution.

Taking advantage of the limited freedom of movement initially accorded him by the Vichy government, he organized the escape system, recruited dozens, and later hundreds, of volunteer workers for the escape line, and found funds for the expenses of housing, transporting, and documenting the Allied soldiers and airmen. At first, some of the exfiltrations to Spain were by sea, but the more common route was for local guides (often smugglers familiar with the Pyrenees), to accompany the soldiers and airmen on foot across the border to Spain.  The escapees were then moved onward by train or car to the British Consulate in Barcelona, and then flown back to the United Kingdom, usually from Gibraltar.  Garrow gathered funds for the expenses of the escape line from residents of Marseille, but MI9 later financed the costs.
