It evidences many of the elements that were to become standard in his portraiture style, including the three-quarters view (a type he revived from antiquity which soon spread across Europe), directional lighting, elaborate headdress, and for the single portraits, the framing of the figure within an undefined narrow space, set against a flat black background. It is noted for its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance; the man has a light beard of one or two days' growth, a reoccurring feature in van Eyck's early male portraits, where the sitter is often either unshaven, or according to Lorne Campbell \"rather inefficiently shaved\".Campbell (1998), 216 Campbell lists other van Eyck unshaven sitters; Niccol\u00f2 Albergati (1431), Jodocus Vijdt (1432), Jan van Eyck?

However, Lorne Campbell has stated that three well-authenticated paintings are known, but each has been doubted or underestimated.Lorne Campbell, \"The New Pictorial Language of Rogier van der Weyden\", in Rogier van der Weyden, Master of Passions, ed. Campbell & Van der Stock, 2009, 32\u201364 The best documented is The Descent from the Cross in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Campbell points out that this painting's provenance can be traced in some detail from the 16th century. Originally hung in the church Notre-Dame-hors-des-Murs in Leuven, The Descent from the Cross was sent to the King of Spain. While the ship on which it was travelling sank, the painting fortunately floated, and careful packaging meant that it was scarcely damaged. A copy of the masterpiece by Michel Coxcie was donated to the people of Leuven to replace the original sent to Spain. The Triptych of the Virgin or Miraflores Altarpiece, since 1850 in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin, was given in 1445 to the Charterhouse of Miraflores near Burgos by John II of Castile; it was described in the deed of gift as the work of great and famous Flandresco Rogel. The Crucifixion, now in the Escorial Palace, was donated by Rogier to the Charterhouse of Scheut outside Brussels. In his catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of van der Weyden, the Belgian art historian Dirk de Vos agrees with Campbell about the authenticity of these three paintings.Dirk de Vos, 232, 291", "*La exposici\u00f3n Rogier van der Weyden \u2013 Lorne Campbell on the 2015 exhibition at the Museo Nacional del Prado "]}, {"page": "Robert Campin", "response": ["The tightest definition of the works from his own hand includes only the \"Fl\u00e9malle\" panels, a 'Nativity at Dijon, a Crucified Thief (fragment of a Crucifixion) in Frankfurt, two portraits of a man and woman in London (of around 1430), and perhaps the Seilern Triptych.  This, which excludes the best known works usually attributed to him, which are then assigned to his workshop or followers, is the position taken by Lorne Campbell."]}, {"page": "Early Netherlandish painting", "response": ["The paintings were most often made on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas. The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use.Campbell (1998), 29 Wood supports allow for dendrochronological dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist's location.Ridderbos (2005), 296\u2013297 The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. Lorne Campbell notes that most are \"beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins\".Campbell (1998), 31 Many paintings' frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, \"done for the artist's amusement\". Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping.Spronk (1997), 8 Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.", "More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence."]}, {"page": "Jan Gossaert", "response": ["* 7 full catalogue entries from the National Gallery, London, by Lorne Campbell"]}, {"page": "Arnolfini Portrait", "response": ["Lorne Campbell in the National Gallery Catalogue sees no need to find a special meaning in the painting: \"...\u00a0there seems little reason to believe that the portrait has any significant narrative content.
