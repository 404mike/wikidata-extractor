Initially he appears to have been an actor, perhaps a sharer, in the Admiral's Men, who performed at the Rose Theatre. After 1598, he assumed some non-acting responsibilities, helping Henslowe and Edward Alleyn manage the business affairs of the company. Yet he remained an actor as late as 1617, as he appears in the \"plots\" for plays including Frederick and Basilea (as Heraclius), The Battle of Alcazar (as an ambassador), and 1 Tamar Cam. He remained with the company through its successive patronage by Prince Henry and the Palsgrave.\nAs a writer, Rowley belonged to the crowd of collaborating playwrights who kept Henslowe and Alleyn supplied with new drama. Henslowe paid him for additions to Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus; tradition, deferential to Marlowe, has assigned him the clown's bits in the 1616 edition. He wrote the now-lost Judas with William Borne (or Bird, or Boyle) and Edward Juby. He also wrote alone. His only extant solo work is When You See Me You Know Me (1603\u20135), a history of Henry VIII from the death of Jane Seymour to the visit of Charles V. He also wrote a play on Richard III and two apparent comedies, Hard Shift for Husbands and A Match or no Match\u2014all three licensed shortly before his death, and none of which has survived.\nOn stylistic grounds, H. D. Sykes assigned him a share in The Famous Victories of Henry V, The Taming of a Shrew, and parts of Robert Greene's Orlando Furioso. These attributions are possible but not widely accepted, as the plays are associated with Queen Elizabeth's Men, a troupe with which Rowley is not otherwise associated. MacD. P. Jackson also credits him with writing Richard II, Part One which others attribute to Shakespeare.\nThe long-uncertain question of his connection to the more-famous William Rowley was perhaps clarified by the discovery of his will in the 1960s: in this document, a brother named William is bequeathed all of Samuel's books. Samuel Rowley died in the parish of St Mary's in Whitechapel, where he had resided for decades.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Marlowe", "response": [":Additional information (attribution): The 'B text' was highly edited and censored, owing in part to the shifting theatre laws regarding religious words onstage during the seventeenth-century.

Thomas of Woodstock survives only as an anonymous and untitled manuscript lacking its final page (or pages), part of the Egerton Collection deposited in the British Library.

Few of its editors, however, have supported the attribution to Shakespeare. Stylistic analysis led MacDonald P. Jackson to propose Samuel Rowley as a possible author in 2001.

Malone suggested that the brief passage in praise of James was probably added for a performance during his reign but that the extended glorification of Elizabeth implies that it was intended for her ears. James \"hated her memory\", so such praise was not likely to have been written under him. Malone mistook the 12 Feb 1604 Stationer's Register entry of \"the Enterlude of K. Henry VIII\" (Samuel Rowley's When You See Me You Know Me, 1605) as Shakespeare's play, and he argued that the reference to the newness of the play in 1613 derived from the fact that it had been expanded with a new prologue and epilogue, perhaps written by Ben Jonson.Edmond Malone, The Plays of William Shakspeare, vol 2, 1790, pp. 150ff. In fact, Shakespeare's play was first registered on 8 November 1623, along with 15 other previously unpublished works, in preparation for the publication of the 1623 First Folio.

It is believed that this led to Christopher Tye being a kind of musical adviser of the court who worked closely with Edward.Doe and Mateer, \"Tye, Christopher,\" in Grove Music Online. In 1605, Samuel Rowley (believed to be Tye's grandson) wrote a play entitled, When You See Me, You Know Me.

Edward Alleyn retired from the stage in 1604, though he was involved with the company as their Fortune Theatre landlord.
