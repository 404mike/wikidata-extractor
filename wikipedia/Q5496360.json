He is best remembered as the creator of the role of the Learned Judge in Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury, providing a model for the comic roles in the later Savoy Operas composed by his brother Arthur Sullivan.\nBy 1870, Sullivan had abandoned architecture for a career on stage.  In 1871, he first performed the role of Mr. Cox in a revival of his brother's first comic opera, Cox and Box, and later that year created the role of Apollo in the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Thespis.  He then remained with the Gaiety Theatre company, playing in Jacques Offenbach pieces, among others.  In 1874 he played in comic operas on tour and in other London theatres.\nIn 1875, he created the role of the Learned Judge in Trial by Jury, also playing in the accompanying Offenbach piece, La P\u00e9richole, and earning enthusiastic reviews.  He then toured in Trial, and French operettas, returning to London for the revival of Trial.  By early 1876, Sullivan's health was deteriorating, and he was forced to stop performing in October 1876.  He died in January 1877, leaving a pregnant widow and seven young children.  Arthur Sullivan's enduring song, \"The Lost Chord\", was composed at Fred's bedside. After Fred's death, Arthur became guardian to the children and helped support Fred's family for the rest of his life even after they moved to California against his wishes.  He left the bulk of his estate to Fred's children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gilbert and Sullivan", "response": ["Fred Sullivan was the prototype for the \"patter\" (comic) baritone roles in the later operas.

Later, these parties would often occur late in the evening after Grossmith performed at the Savoy Theatre.Grossmith (1888), Chapter VII In 1876, he collaborated with Florence Marryat, the author and reciter, on Entre Nous.  This piece consisted of a series of piano sketches, alternating with scenes and costumed recitations, including a two-person \"satirical musical sketch\", really a short comic opera, called Cups and Saucers, which they then toured. Grossmith also took a number of engagements, including recitals at private homes. In 1877, Lionel Brough introduced another popular Grossmith song, \"The Muddle Puddle Junction Porter\". By then, Grossmith had become friendly with many in the music and theatre establishments, including Arthur Sullivan and impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte; and Grossmith had the opportunity to perform in Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury and other Sullivan works at charity benefits.Grossmith, George. \"Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Personal Reminiscence\".
