He led the club to their first major trophy by winning the First Division title in 1908. With two First Division titles, one FA Cup and two Charity Shield trophies, he remains the third most successful manager at the club.List of Manchester United F.C. managers#Statistics He started his management at Manchester United in 1903 and saw his team narrowly miss promotion in his first two seasons before success at the third attempt, as the club finished as runners-up in the Second Division. In the first season in the First Division the club finished in mid-table. However, in only their second season in the First Division, he managed United to their first ever League Championship in 1907\u201308 by a nine-point margin over Aston Villa. The following year saw United drop below mid-table but the club won its first FA Cup with a 1\u20130 victory in the final against Bristol City, the winner scored by Sandy Turnbull. The following season saw no new silverware but the team improved its league position to fifth. In the 1910-11 season the club were champions again, beating Aston Villa into second place by just one point; it would be club's last league championship for over 40 years \u2013 its longest ever run without a league title. The next season was his last in charge at the club; he would eventually leave for a similar position at Manchester City."]}]}}
