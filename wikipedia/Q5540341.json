He faced a four-cornered contest at the 1922 general election. In addition to Conservative and Labour opponents he also faced a Lloyd George National Liberal, the former MP for Truro, George Hay Morgan, the Truro seat having been abolished in boundary changes. Mansel finished in second place with 32% of the poll, behind the Conservative candidate, Captain Denis Shipwright who obtained 43%.

Shipwright was only 23 years old but his record of serving throughout the war was noted.The Times, 19 December 1921, p. 7. He had begun a business career as a Director of Porthia China Clays Ltd. During his election campaign Shipwright's election address pledged him to a strong Navy, and a foreign policy which aimed at securing an honourable peace with a just settlement of reparations and war debts. In domestic policy he sought economy without decreasing safety and efficiency. The Liberal Party's national split was mirrored in Penryn and Falmouth with Sir Courtenay Mansel fighting as the official candidate but opposed by George Hay Morgan who was a former MP for Truro; there was also a Labour Party candidate. Shipwright won the election with 11,566 votes and a majority of 2,687 over Mansel. To celebrate his election, the ex-servicemen of Falmouth ceremoniously dragged his motor car up hill to the station when he caught the train to London to take his seat.See picture, The Times, 21 November 1922, p. 16."]}]}}
