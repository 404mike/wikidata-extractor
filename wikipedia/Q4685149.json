His selection of classic comedy clips was at times quite complex, and intricately produced, using material from a wide variety of sources edited into one sequence. This style of show was inspired by Jack Jackson, who died shortly before Juste commenced on Radio 1. Controversially, he produced an audio tape in the style of his show which was used as a promotional aid by the Conservative Party.\nJuste was amongst the older DJs who were dismissed during the early 1990s by the then controller of Radio 1 Matthew Bannister, leaving in 1994. He bitterly railed against the changes in a subsequent BBC television documentary on Bannister's time at the radio station. Juste subsequently made appearances on LBC, Radio Carousel and Jewel FM, and currently works as an advertising writer. He also did a few editions of \"The UK Top 20 Rewind\" with Shaun Tilley during 2003. He appeared on a Christmas special on BBC local radio in 2005 and two more shows for KCFM, during 2008 and 2009 featuring the usual mix of music and comedy.Juste now provides the voice-over for the online bingo site tombola on its \"Bingo 50\" game. He presented shows in the south west on BBC local radio stations on Christmas Days in 2010, 2011 and 2012, and one final show that aired on BBC Radio Devon and BBC Guernsey between 12:00 and 13:00 on Christmas Day 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Free Radio Birmingham", "response": ["* Adrian Juste (1974\u20131977)"]}, {"page": "Les Ross", "response": ["In 1974, Ross's initial application to BRMB was rejected and he subsequently joined Radio Tees in the North East of England presenting their breakfast show in summer 1975. Ross also presented a successful Saturday morning music show which used the talents of the station's record librarian Wincey Willis as co-presenter. In March 1976, he returned to Birmingham and joined BRMB, taking over the breakfast show from Adrian Juste, who had left to join BBC Radio 1."]}, {"page": "List of Top of the Pops presenters", "response": ["The close association with Radio 1 continued into the 1980s, with all TOTP presenters drawn from the ranks of DJs at the station.

New equipment needed to be added to the studios so music in this format could be played. The record library also evolved to store the CD cases."]}]}}
