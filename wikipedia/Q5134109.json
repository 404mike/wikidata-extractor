He later served overseas as undersecretary for finance in Egypt from 1895 to 1899.  His final role was as financial advisor to Lord Curzon, Governor-General of India in 1899.\nDuring 1899, he accepted an offer from the financier John Pierpont Morgan of full partnership in the London branch of his firm, J. S. Morgan & Co., where he remained until his death in 1905.  He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.\nIn recognition of Dawkins' work in chairing a Committee reviewing the Administration of the War Office, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.
