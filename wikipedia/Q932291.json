In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 52.98, bettering his time of 53.17 set in 2005. Peirsol became the first man in the event to go under 53 seconds and beat Ryan Lochte by 0.52\u00a0s.  At the time, Peirsol held five of the fastest times posted in the event.  At one point during the first 50-meters, Peirsol was a full meter behind Ryan Lochte, and at the turn, Peirsol was in third place behind Liam Tancock and Lochte.  But Peirsol had a superior finish to over-take both swimmers. After the race, Peirsol thanked Lochte for the fast start, which he attributed to the world record. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Lochte and lost his world record he set in 2006. Throughout the race, Peirsol was in first and at the 150-meter mark, Peirsol was ahead of Lochte 1:24.56 to 1:25.05.  But Lochte had a strong finish to over-take Peirsol for the win. For Peirsol, it was his first international loss in the event since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Peirsol did not have a chance to swim in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay final because the United States was disqualified in the heats.", "At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay.  He also won silver in the 200-meter backstroke.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was the heavy favorite for gold, with him being the world-record holder and the defending Olympic champion.  For the final of the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was swimming in lane two, having qualified fifth in the semi-finals.  At the first 50-meters in the 100-meter backstroke final, Peirsol was in second place behind Liam Tancock, who took it out in 25.11.  Peirsol was 0.54\u00a0s behind Tancock at the turn.  However, after the turn, Peirsol overtook Tancock, who eventually placed sixth, and won the gold.  Peirsol's final time of 52.54 was a new world record, bettering his previous mark of 52.89 set last month.  After the race, Peirsol said, \"I'm a little bit excited, a little bit relieved, absolutely elated.\" In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Lochte 1:54.33 to 1:53.94.  In winning the gold, Lochte broke the world record tie he and Peirsol shared in the 200-meter backstroke. In his last event, the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:29.34, lowering the old mark of 3:30.68 set four years ago in Athens."]}, {"page": "2008 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)", "response": ["|Liam Tancock  ||  23.53", "|Liam Tancock  || 50.14ER", "|Liam Tancock  || 52.22", "|Liam Tancock  ||  1:53.10"]}, {"page": "2005 European Short Course Swimming Championships", "response": ["|Liam Tancock", "|Mark FosterLiam TancockChris CozensAnthony Howard ", "|Liam TancockChris CookMatthew ClayMark Foster"]}, {"page": "England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": [":Liam Tancock, Men's 50 m Backcrawl", "* Liam Tancock"]}, {"page": "Caitlin McClatchey", "response": ["McClatchey has been in a relationship with fellow swimmer Liam Tancock since 2006.

After the race, Sun said, \"With the London Games a year out, I will have to be more strict with myself and start back at zero. Hopefully, I can create miracles at the Olympics.\"  Prior to this, Hackett's record was the longest standing record unbroken even with the \"supersuits\" of 2009.
