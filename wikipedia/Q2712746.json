This translation remained the only one until 1649 when the first English language translation was done by Alexander Ross, chaplain to King Charles I, who translated from a French work L'Alcoran de Mahomet by du Ryer. In 1734, George Sale produced the first translation of the Qur\u02bban direct from Arabic into English but reflecting his missionary stance. Since then, there have been English translations by the clergyman John Medows Rodwell in 1861, and Edward Henry Palmer in 1880, both showing in their works several mistakes of mistranslation and misinterpretation, which brings into question their primary aim. These were followed by Richard Bell in 1937 and Arthur John Arberry in the 1950s."]}, {"page": "Ghazal", "response": ["Enormous collections of ghazal have been created by hundreds of well-known poets over the past thousand years in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu as well as in the Central Asian Turkic languages.

The bulk of surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the Muslim conquest of Persia c. 650\u00a0CE. After the Abbasids came to power (750 CE), the Iranians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Islamic Caliphate and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. The New Persian language literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and Transoxiana because of political reasons, early Iranian dynasties of post-Islamic Iran such as the Tahirids and Samanids being based in Khorasan.Frye, R.N., \"Dar\u012b\", The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Brill Publications, CD version."]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic", "response": ["* Arthur John Arberry (1947\u20131969)"]}, {"page": "Arthur john arberry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur John Arberry"]}, {"page": "A.
