On the pitch, the team had experienced something of a revival, winning five matches and drawing two of a 9-match spell between late February and early April, but the retirement of George Thomson and the departure of Eddie Reeve left manager Jimmy Sirrel with just 14 players with which to complete the season. Brentford finished in 14th place and used just 18 outfield players during the course of the season.", "|Eddie Reeve", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Eddie Reeve", "| Eddie Reeve", "| Eddie Reeve"]}]}}
