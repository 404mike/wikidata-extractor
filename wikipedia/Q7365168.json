His most notable role was during World War II when he was General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 1st Infantry Division during the controversial Battle of Anzio, part of the Italian Campaign, in early 1944.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Anzio", "response": ["By February\u00a018, after desperate fighting, the Allies' Final Beachhead Line (prepared defenses more or less on the line of the original beachhead) was under attack. Numerous attacks were launched on 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (2nd Brigade) and they lost a company, overrun, and the day after had suffered 200 casualties. On the same day Major-General Ronald Penney, General Officer Commanding (GOC) British 1st Division, had been wounded by shellfire and the division was temporarily commanded by Major-General Templer, GOC 56th (London) Division, which had arrived complete. However, a counterattack using VI\u00a0Corps' reserves halted the German advance, and on February 20, Fischfang petered out with both sides exhausted. During Fischfang the Germans had sustained some 5,400 casualties, the Allies 3,500. Both had suffered nearly 20,000 casualties each since the first landings, and it was \"far the highest density of destruction in the Italian campaign, perhaps in the whole war\". Also on February\u00a018 while returning to Anzio the light cruiser  was struck by two torpedoes and sunk with a loss of 417\u00a0men. Despite the exhausted state of the troops, Hitler insisted that 14th\u00a0Army should continue to attack. Despite the misgivings of both Kesselring and von Mackensen, a further assault was mounted on February\u00a029, this time on LXXVI\u00a0Panzer Corps' front around Cisterna. This push achieved little except to generate a further 2,500 casualties for the 14th\u00a0Army."]}, {"page": "Eric Dorman-Smith", "response": ["In 1924, he left his regiment to become an instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he became acquainted with Richard O'Connor; the duo went on a walking tour of the Austro-Italian Alps at the end of 1924.Greacen p. 94 In 1927, Dorman-Smith sat the entrance examination for the Staff College, Camberley. In the Strategy paper the examiner, J. F. C. Fuller, awarded him 1,000 marks out of a possible 1,000. The advantage of gaining the p.s.c. (passed Staff College) was that the two-year course provided a network of 180 highly trained officers for help afterwards. By arriving with such a splash, it is probable that Dorman-Smith became regarded with suspicion by people who would one day be his peers and superior officers.Greacen pp. 96\u20137 Many of Dorman-Smith's fellow students there included the future general officers of the Second World War, including Philip Christison, Evelyn Barker, Oliver Leese, Eric Hayes, John Hawkesworth, Ronald Penney, John Whiteley, Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman, Eric Nares, Charles Norman, Stanley Kirby, Wilfrid Lloyd, Reginald Savory and Clement West.Smart, p. 88", "Remaining virtually unemployed for the next few months, in late April 1944 Dorman-Smith learned that he was to be given command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, part of the 1st Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Ronald Penney, then fighting on the Italian Front in the Anzio beachhead. By now, however, his reputation was such that all the senior British commanders in Italy, from General Sir Harold Alexander, C-in-C of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), who had succeeded General Auchinleck as C-in-C Middle East in August 1942, along with his chief of staff, Lieutenant-General John Harding, and Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, the Eighth Army commander, all wished to turn him down, but were overruled by Brooke, who made it clear to Dorman-Smith that this was his \"sink or swim\" moment. Alexander, Harding and Leese had all been fellow students at Camberley in the late 1920s, Alexander in the year senior, Harding \u2212 \"independent of mind and short of stature\"Greacen, p. 101 \u2212 and one who Dorman-Smith greatly respected, in the year below, whereas Leese had been in Dorman-Smith's year."]}, {"page": "Philip Christison", "response": ["After vacating his position as adjutant of the 4th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, another TA unit, in November 1923, Christison was assistant manager of the British Olympic team in Paris in 1924 which was followed by a further appointment as an adjutant, this time with his regiment.

Templer's instructors there included Bernard Paget, Henry Pownall and Bernard Montgomery. Due to the Royal Irish Fusiliers being reduced to a single battalion in 1922, and thus promotion in the regiment being slower than in the rest of the army, Templer was forced to transfer to the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), to gain a promotion to captain, which was backdated to 11 August 1928.Heathcote, Anthony pg 274 After graduation from the Staff College, Templer joined the 2nd Battalion of his new regiment, then stationed at Aldershot, in January 1930.Cloake, pps. 49\u201350", "In February 1944, the division, now under U.S. VI Corps, fought in the Battle of Anzio where Templer temporarily commanded the British 1st Infantry Division after the GOC, Major-General Ronald Penney, was wounded by shellfire.

The 168th Brigade was chosen and was, again, detached from the division to temporarily come under command of the British 1st Infantry Division, at the time fighting at Anzio and under command of U.S. VI Corps.Joslen, p. 36. The 168th Brigade landed at Anzio on 3 February where, soon after arrival, the battalions were almost immediately thrown into battle as the Germans launched a counterattack and the London Scottish, as vanguard of the brigade and supported by Sherman tanks of the 46th Royal Tank Regiment, launched their own spirited counterattack in an attempt to relieve the 3rd Brigade (1st Dukes, 2nd Foresters, 1st KSLI), of British 1st Division, which was surrounded, in what was known to both sides as the \"Thumb\", by Campoleone station and the lateral road, and was virtually cut off, taking heavy casualties. The London Scottish, supported by 46th RTR, \"fought their way forward over sodden ground under heavy German fire in a driving rain\",D'Este, p. 199. ending up some 400 yards short of the lateral road which shored up the right flank long enough to enable the 3rd Brigade to withdraw, under cover of nightfall, without further loss.Blaxland, p. 46. However, the brigade had to leave behind much of its equipment and the London Scottish had, in just a few short hours of battle, sustained over 100 casualties.D'Este, pps. 199-200. In its first action at Anzio the brigade helped to repel a major counterattack, potentially saving the British 1st Division from destruction, in some of the fiercest fighting endured by soldiers of either side on the Italian Front thus far. Indeed, Albert Kesselring, the Commander of the German forces in Italy \"believed that the Fourteenth Army had overestimated the strength of VI Corps and that the attack should have commenced at least twenty-four hours earlier, before the arrival of the 168th Brigade\".D'Este, p. 200-201. The 168th Brigade reverted to control of 56th Division on 15 February when the 56th Divisional Headquarters began to land. The brigade continued to fight for nearly six weeks in the severe battles at Anzio where even senior officers were not always safe, such as was the case with Major-General Ronald Penney, GOC British 1st Division, wounded by shellfire on 17 February and the GOC 56th Division, Major-General Gerald Templer, took command of both the 1st and 56th divisions,D'Este, p. 236. until 23 February when Penney took command of 1st Division again.Joslen, pp. 35\u201336. Over a month later, the heavily battered brigade was relieved in the line by 17th Infantry Brigade, of the British 5th Infantry Division, in late March 1944 and was withdrawn to Egypt to rest and refit,Blaxland, p. 71. and was to remain there until mid-July."]}, {"page": "Charles Norman (British Army officer)", "response": ["After being released in 1919, he remained in the army, initially with the 9th Lancers serving around the British Empire, in India and Egypt.
