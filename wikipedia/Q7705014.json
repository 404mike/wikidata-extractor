Alcester was an important Roman settlement of around eighteen hectares laying bestride Ryknild Street in a loop of the River Arrow to the west of its confluence with the River Alne, underlying the modern town. Town defences have been confirmed only on the east side of the settlement's circuit, where they consist of a clay rampart dated to the \"second century or later\", fronted by a 2.75-metre wide wall which was probably not contemporary with the bank. There is also a suspected Roman fort around one kilometre to the south-east of the known Roman settlement located on Primrose Hill which overlooks both the confluence of the River Arrow with the River Alne and the junction of Ryknield Street with the road south from the Roman settlement at Salinae Droitwich Spa, known as the Salt Way after the main export from the area in Roman times. Items of bronze were recovered include a harness ring with a masked loop typical of those used by auxiliary cavalry. The earliest occupation date based on these findings appears to be Flavian. Other significant Roman settlements included Tripontium near Rugby and Manduessedum near Atherstone. www.Roman-Britain.org Manduessedum  The area around Manduessedum is known to have had an extensive pottery industry, which extended to near what is now Nuneaton, the remains of up to thirty pottery kilns having been found in this area.A History of Warwickshire, by Canon Doctor Terry Slater (1981) ", "*A History of Warwickshire, by Canon Doctor Terry Slater (1981) ", "*An Historical Atlas of Warwickshire by Canon Doctor Terry Slater (2004)  "]}, {"page": "Canon Doctor Terry Slater", "response": ["#REDIRECT Terry Slater (geographer)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Birmingham alumni", "response": ["* Terry Slater, Reader in Historical Geography"]}, {"page": "Slater (surname)", "response": ["*Terry Slater (geographer), British academic"]}, {"page": "Terry Slater", "response": ["Terry Slater may refer to:", "* Terry Slater (geographer), British geographer", "* Terry Slater (ice hockey), Canadian ice hockey player and coach"]}]}}
