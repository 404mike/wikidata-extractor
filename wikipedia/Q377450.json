Yaras claimed that she had herself several times been visited in the house by Langtry's ghost. On 11 April 1971 The Hampstead News said that the house had been built for Langtry by Lord Leighton. These claims, made to suggest an historical importance for the house and support its preservation, were supported by the actress Adrienne Corri and publicised in The Times of 8 October 1971 and The Daily Telegraph of 9 October 1971. They were given further publicity by Anita Leslie in 1973. The house was, however, demolished in 1971 to make way for the Alexandra Road Estate. In 2021 research revealed that the house had been built in the 1860s by Samuel Litchfield and probably named after his wife's birthplace of Leighton Buzzard, and lengthy work in local records by Dick Weindling and Marianne Colloms has revealed no connection whatever with Lillie Langtry.http://kilburnwesthampstead.blogsport.com/2021/05/looking-for-lillie-langtry.html'Historians say there's no evidence for Lillie Langtry link to Camden' in Camden New Journal, 29 May 2021.

This incident, coupled with her perceived role in the death of her brother, makes Harriet lose the will to live. Preferring to die, she runs away from home that night and attempts to commit suicide by floating down the river in an unattended canoe-like skiff. The river should not be navigated at night, as there are strong currents, and two or three people are usually needed to row a boat against the current. Overcome with very high waves, an unattended boat would take on water and sink. Dying on the river, as from a boat that sinks, would certainly have the appearance of an accident, but Harriet takes things a step further by lowering herself into the water. Her death would have been a sure thing but her brother's friend has seen her steal the boat and fishermen rally to rescue her from the water. Ashore, she is brought back to life, and the captain then kisses her on the forehead.
