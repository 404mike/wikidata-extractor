Niblett debuted in 2001 with her first full-length studio album Sweet Heart Fever, and has gone on to release five more studio albums. In 2013, Niblett released her sixth studio album, It's Up to Emma, which she mixed and produced.\nNiblett's music is frequently minimalist in style, many of her songs consisting merely of vocals accompanied by either drums or guitar. She is also known for her intimate live shows. In addition to songwriting and music, Niblett is also a professional astrologer, and often incorporates astrological themes into her song lyrics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Courtney Love", "response": ["Among the alternative musicians who have cited Love as an influence are Scout Niblett; Brody Dalle of The Distillers; Dee Dee Penny of Dum Dum Girls; and Nine Black Alps.

Love has frequently been recognized as the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s, and for \"subverting [the] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound.\" According to music journalist Maria Raha, \"Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism.\" Patti Smith, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: \"I hate genderizing things\u00a0...
