Allen was elected, but Fraser mounted a successful election petition, and Allen was disqualified from standing again.  The by-election was contested by Fraser and Sir Walter Buller, the well known ornithologist, who both represented the Liberal Party, plus a third candidate who was not taken seriously.

Fraser petitioned against the election on three grounds: that Allen (who at the time of the election was overseas) had not given his consent to being nominated, that scrutineers had not been appointed by Allen in writing, and charges of bribery, corruption and treating of Allen's agents. The case was heard over two and a half days by Chief Justice James Prendergast and by Justice Edward Conolly. They issued their judgement on 3 April 1891, and declared that Allen's nomination was legal, charges of bribery or corruption were not proven, but that T. O. Hammond having been a paid agent of Allen was in violation of the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, 1881, and the election was thus declared void.  There was then legal argument that Fraser should be declared duly elected instead, but Justice Conolly rejected this, stating that it was up to the House of Representatives to decide on that.  The judges disqualified Allen from standing in the Te Aroha electorate for 12 months, but he could contest by-elections in other electorates should they arise.  Allen regretted that he could not contest the upcoming by-election.  Some of his friends decided to petition parliament to have the disqualification overturned. The Public Petition Committee reported to the House on 10 July (i.e. the day after the by-election) and recommended that the Government pass a bill to remove the stigma of disqualification."]}, {"page": "List of Wadham College, Oxford people", "response": ["* William Shepherd Allen, UK and New Zealand politician"]}, {"page": "Woodhead Hall", "response": ["Woodhead Hall was originally commissioned by a Mr Leigh and completed in 1720.
