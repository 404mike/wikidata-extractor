Bury dominated the first half, with Don Beet writing in The Guardian that they \"flung everything at Billy Stewart's goal from the start\".  Midway through the first half, a long throw-in flew deep into the Bury penalty area and after Des Hazel challenged a defender, the ball fell to Lormor who struck it cleanly past Gary Kelly in the Bury goal to make it 1\u20130.  In the 41st minute, Chesterfield doubled their lead: Law sent in another long throw-in and Robinson headed it into the Bury net despite the attention of a number of defenders.  At half time, Bury made their first change of the game with Mark Carter being substituted off for John Paskin.  The 68th minute saw Bury's closest chance to score when Rigby struck a free kick against the Chesterfield goalpost.  Late in the game, Kelly saved attempts to score from both Robinson and second-half substitute Kevin Davies.
