It had 10,678 members and 4,442 associates. As the GFS expanded so did their concerns and the scope of their work. New departments established in the late 1800s included one dealing with the special needs of sick and blind members, and one dealing with the safety of emigrating girls and women had been established.  During the 1880s and 1890s, the GFS increased their offerings of training courses and workshops. Beginning in 1880, Queen Victoria bestowed her royal patronage on the Girls' Friendly Society and the queen herself acted as an associate and admitted servant girls at Balmoral to membership. page 8 In 1883 the GFS appointed Ellen Joyce as their GFS emigration correspondent. Joyce had been one of the GFS's seventy-five founding associates and she wanted to support emigration, but she was aware of the risks that girls would be exposed to. Girls were given \"anchor crosses\" to place on their luggage. Joyce would eventually lead the United British Women's Emigration Association in 1888, but her role in the GFS continued."]}, {"page": "1920 New Year Honours", "response": ["* The Honourable Ellen Joyce, Vice-President, British Women's Emigration Association."]}, {"page": "British Women's Emigration Association", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ellen Joyce"]}, {"page": "Joyce, Ellen", "response": ["#redirectEllen Joyce"]}]}}
