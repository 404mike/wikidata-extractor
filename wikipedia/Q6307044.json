However, against a backdrop of Welsh nationalist bombings and protests against the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales the FWA presented an appealing target to the government, and in 1969 nine members were arrested and charged with public order offences. The trial, in Swansea, lasted 53 days, ending on the day of the investiture. On the first day of the trial the defendants were \"greeted with an impromptu recital of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau from the public gallery.\" Almost all of the prosecution's evidence came from journalists who had reported the group's claims.
