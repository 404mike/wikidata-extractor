He was the son of a gardener, John Starley, and Mary Ann (n\u00e9e Cippen). In 1872 he moved to Coventry to work with his uncle James Starley, an inventor. He worked with his uncle and William Hillman for several years building Ariel cycles.\nIn 1877, he started a new business Starley & Sutton Co with William Sutton, a local cycling enthusiast. They set about developing bicycles that were safer and easier to use than the prevailing penny farthing or \"ordinary\" bicycles. They started by manufacturing tricycles, and by 1883 their products were being branded as \"Rover\".\nIn 1885, Starley made history when he produced the Rover Safety Bicycle.  The Rover was a rear-wheel-drive, chain-driven cycle with two similar-sized wheels, making it more stable than the previous high wheeler designs. Cycling magazine said the Rover had \"set the pattern to the world\" and the phrase was used in their advertising for many years.\n\nIn 1889, the company became J. K. Starley & Co. Ltd and in the late 1890s, it had become the Rover Cycle Company Ltd.\nStarley died suddenly on 29 October 1901, and was succeeded as managing director of the firm by Harry Smyth. Soon after Starley's death the Rover company began building motorcycles and then cars.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1901", "response": ["** John Kemp Starley, English bicycle inventor (b. 1854)"]}, {"page": "1885", "response": ["* John Kemp Starley demonstrates the Rover safety bicycle, regarded as the first practical modern bicycle."]}, {"page": "1854", "response": ["* December 14 \u2013 John Kemp Starley, English bicycle inventor (d. 1901)"]}, {"page": "Coventry", "response": ["In the late 19th\u00a0century, Coventry became a major centre of bicycle manufacture.

The rider was seated over the wheel, just aft of the wheel hub.  Many mishaps included the projection of the rider head-first over the handle bars: an event occurring with enough frequency to earn the name, header. Several manufacturers created safety models, which denoted a low-mount bicycle. Motive force came from cranks applied to a sprocket and chain creating an indirect drive to one of the wheels. The first commercially viable model was John Kemp Starley's Rover, drawing interest starting in 1885.  The early Rover featured a complicated indirect steering system, but Starley replaced it with a direct steering system consisting of a single curved bar attached to the head.  In 1886, after seeing some Rovers and touring a Rover-factory, Alfred Pope claimed that the safety bicycle was nothing more than a fad, and made no plans at that time to produce his own version.  George Bidwell, by this time an independent agent again, recommended the safety after trying the mount in 1886.Herlihy (2004), pp. 235241.
