Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today."]}, {"page": "Welsh mythology", "response": ["Welsh mythology consists of both folk traditions developed in Wales, and traditions developed by the Celtic Britons elsewhere before the end of the first millennium. As in most of the predominantly oral societies Celtic mythology and history were recorded orally by specialists such as druids (). This oral record has been lost or altered as a result of outside contact and invasion over the years. Much of this altered mythology and history is preserved in medieval Welsh manuscripts, which include the Red Book of Hergest, the White Book of Rhydderch, the Book of Aneirin and the Book of Taliesin. Other works connected to Welsh mythology include the ninth-century Latin historical compilation Historia Brittonum (\"History of the Britons\") and Geoffrey of Monmouth's twelfth-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"), as well as later folklore, such as the materials collected in The Welsh Fairy Book by William Jenkyn Thomas (1908)."]}, {"page": "William Thomas", "response": ["* William Jenkyn Thomas (1870\u20131959), Welsh author"]}]}}
