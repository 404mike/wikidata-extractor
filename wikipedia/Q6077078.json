However, despite his contentious nature, Schomberg was a brave officer who gained distinction in several actions during the American Revolutionary and French Revolutionary Wars. He finished his career as a commissioner of the Navy and devoted most of the last fifteen years of his life to writing an influential history of naval operations in and around Britain.\nSchomberg was born in London to Ralph Schomberg, son of Meyer L\u00f6w Schomberg both prominent physicians of German Jewish descent, although his father had converted to the Anglican faith in his youth. His mother was Elizabeth Crowcher, daughter of a wealthy merchant from Wapping. One of ten children with seven uncles, Schomberg's family were very prominent in middle-class eighteenth century London and Isaac (not to be confused with his uncle Isaac Schomberg, a prominent doctor) grew up in a literary environment, his father a common contributor to medical and literary journals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Schomberg", "response": ["*Isaac Schomberg (1753\u20131813), controversial officer of the British Royal Navy"]}, {"page": "Battle of Saint Kitts", "response": ["|+Admiral Sir Samuel Hood's fleetIsaac Schomberg Naval Chronology, pp.\u00a0396\u20137"]}, {"page": "HMS Pegasus (1779)", "response": ["Prince William Henry's First Lieutenant was William Hargood, who the prince had brought with him.
