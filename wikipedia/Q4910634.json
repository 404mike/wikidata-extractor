Stoke went into the match as narrow favourites but went on to outclass Albion in all positions. The first goal came after 10 minutes as Steele headed in a Stanley Matthews cross. Albion levelled just a minute later through Richardson following a fine move. Stoke re-took the lead through a copy of their first on 20 minutes as Albion struggled to contain Matthews. After 32 minutes Stoke went 3\u20131 up, Steele was brought down in the area by Bill Richardson and Arthur Turner scored from the spot. Four minutes before half-time Steele claimed his hat-trick. In the second half Stoke made it 5\u20131 through England winger Joe Johnson before Steele missed an open goal. Wally Boyes pulled one back to 5\u20132 however Steele got his fourth and fifth to make it 7\u20132 on 67 minutes. Richardson made it 7\u20133 before Johnson again and George Antonio got on the score sheet. With 15 minutes left the score line was 9\u20133 and with the crowd chanting for more it duly arrived when Antonio made it 10\u20133 to complete a historic result."]}, {"page": "Bill Richardson (footballer born 1908)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Richardson (footballer, born 1908)"]}]}}
