The Caldecott Medal was named in his honour. He exercised his art chiefly in book illustrations. His abilities as an artist were promptly and generously recognised by the Royal Academy. Caldecott greatly influenced illustration of children's books during the nineteenth century. Two books illustrated by him, priced at a shilling each, were published every Christmas for eight years.\nCaldecott also illustrated novels and accounts of foreign travel, made humorous drawings depicting hunting and fashionable life, drew cartoons and he made sketches of the Houses of Parliament inside and out, and exhibited sculptures and paintings in oil and watercolour in the Royal Academy and galleries.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beatrix Potter", "response": ["Potter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairy tales and fantasy.

She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott, the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence.Lear 2007, p. 33 When she started to illustrate, she chose first the traditional rhymes and stories, \"Cinderella\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\", \"Puss-in-boots\", and \"Red Riding Hood\".Lear 2007, pp. 127\u20138 However, most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.Taylor, et al., The Artist and her World, pp. 49\u201370;  Potter, Journal, 1884\u20131897; Humphrey Carpenter (1985), Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children's Literature."]}, {"page": "February 12", "response": ["*1886 \u2013 Randolph Caldecott, English-American painter and illustrator (b. 1846)"]}, {"page": "March 22", "response": ["*1846 \u2013 Randolph Caldecott, English illustrator and painter (d. 1886)"]}, {"page": "Nursery rhyme", "response": ["The early years of the 20th century are notable for the illustrations to children's books including Randolph Caldecott's Hey Diddle Diddle Picture Book (1909) and Arthur Rackham's Mother Goose (1913).

A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling's own childhood. In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books, among them Arthur Rackham, Cicely Mary Barker, W. Heath Robinson, Henry J. Ford, John Leech, and George Cruikshank. In the 1890s, some of the best known fairy tales from England were compiled in Joseph Jacobs' English Fairy Tales, including Jack and the Beanstalk, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, The Three Little Pigs, Jack the Giant Killer and Tom Thumb.", "Another method of creating illustrations for children's books was etching, used by George Cruikshank in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, and John Tenniel. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children.

He mainly painted landscapes such as La Berg\u00e8re Bretonne (\"The Breton Shepherdess\"), in which the figure plays a subordinate role. His Jeunes Bretons au bain (\"Young Breton Boys Bathing\"), introducing a theme he returned to each time he visited Pont-Aven, is clearly indebted to Degas in its design and bold use of pure color. The naive drawings of the English illustrator Randolph Caldecott, used to illustrate a popular guide-book on Brittany, had caught the imagination of the avant-garde student artists at Pont-Aven, anxious to free themselves from the conservatism of their academies, and Gauguin consciously imitated them in his sketches of Breton girls.Blackburn (1880) These sketches were later worked up into paintings back in his Paris studio. The most important of these is Four Breton Women, which shows a marked departure from his earlier Impressionist style as well as incorporating something of the naive quality of Caldecott's illustration, exaggerating features to the point of caricature."]}, {"page": "Cicely Mary Barker", "response": ["Barker was born the second daughter and youngest child of Walter Barker, a partner in a seed supply company and an amateur artist, and his wife Mary Eleanor (Oswald) Barker on 28 June 1895 at home at 66 Waddon Road in Croydon, Surrey, England.

This he followed by English versions of the rondel, rondeau and villanelle. An article in The Cornhill Magazine by Edmund Gosse, \"A Plea for Certain Exotic Forms of Verse\", appearing in July 1877, simultaneously with Dobson's second volume, Proverbs in Porcelain, drew the general eye to the possibilities and achievements of the movement. The experiment was deemed a success. In 1883 Dobson published Old-World Idylls, which contained some of his most characteristic work. By this time his taste was gradually settling on the period with which it has since become almost exclusively associated; and the spirit of the 18th century was revived in \"The Ballad of Beau Brocade\" and in \"The Story of Rosina\", as nowhere else in modern English poetry. In \"Beau Brocade\", the pictorial quality of his work is at its very best. He has been compared with Randolph Caldecott, with which it has much in common; but Dobson's humour was not so \"rollicking\" and his portraiture not so broad as that of the illustrator of John Gilpin.
