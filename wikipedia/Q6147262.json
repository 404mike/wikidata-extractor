The Buffalo movement included a group of photographers, designers and artists, such as Jamie Morgan and Marc Lebon. The Buffalo aesthetic was drawn from styles seen on the streets and in nightclubs. One of the most radical aspects of Buffalo was the use of diverse models that were rarely seen in advertising at the time. As such agency models were scarce, the Buffalo movement turned to the streets to find new faces, such as Naomi Campbell, who Kamen described as \"this nutty girl aged about fourteen, but she was part of the crew\". Modern designers continue to draw on the aesthetics of Buffalo, and in 2015, Kamen collaborated with the brand Dr. Martens to style the Spirit of Buffalo campaign."]}]}}
