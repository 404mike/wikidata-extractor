The books are undated and it is difficult to give an accurate date, but the fact that John Marshall did not move into the Flesh Market premises until 1811, dates them not before that date. Several of the later books can be dated approximately from the events, or dates within the titles. The first volumes appeared around the same time as John Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards, published in 1812,.
