Skemp was recruited by the OPC in 1946, and promotions followed to Deputy Parliamentary Counsel in 1963, then Parliamentary Counsel the next year. In 1973, he was appointed Second Parliamentary Counsel, serving until retirement in 1980. For the first three years, he held the office jointly with Henry Rowe (later Sir Henry), who went on to be First Parliamentary Counsel (Skemp had been considered for the role, but the decision to advance Rowe was due partly to Skemp's heart condition). After leaving the OPC in 1980, he then spent five years as Counsel to the Speaker."]}]}}
