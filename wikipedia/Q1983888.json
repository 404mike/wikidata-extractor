He came up with the band name \"Them\" (from the 1954 sci-fi film Them!), but as he was a minor his parents declined to sign a recording contract on his behalf and he was replaced in July 1964 prior to recording with the band. By August 1965, he had completed his studies and very briefly returned to Them.Wrixon was next a member of Belfast R&B group The People and probably played on the two tracks they contributed to the February 1966 compilation album Ireland's Greatest Sounds: Five Top Groups From Belfast's Maritime Club (both tracks feature keyboards). While based in Blackpool, Wrixon left the band in mid-1966 to join another Belfast band, the Wheels, with whom he recorded the single 'Kicks' in August 1966. \nIn 1967, he moved to Germany with The Never Never Band and subsequently joined Irish midlands-based pop group The Trixons, who also released a number of singles in the late 1960s. He quit in 1969, when he and fellow-Belfast exile Eric Bell began recruiting a new band from among the Dublin musical scene. The result in early 1970 was Thin Lizzy, but Wrixon left in July of that year due to lack of finances and returned to Germany.Wrixon briefly joined a reformed Them in Hamburg, recording the 1979 album, Shut Your Mouth but leaving before its promotional tour. In 1993, he formed 'Them \u2013 The Belfast Blues Band' \u2013 often billed by media and promoters as 'Them' \u2013 for \"progressive rhythm and blues\" live performances throughout Europe (including a 1996 tour), featuring his songs such as Crazy Woman and Marcel's Song. Wrixon later lived in Italy and toured with a line-up including himself (vocals and keyboards), Billy McCoy (guitars), Luca Nardi (bass) and Tom Wagener (drums). The band also recorded a studio album and were planning a live concert DVD. \nWrixon died on 13 July 2015 in Italy at the age of 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Van Morrison", "response": ["The roots of Them, the band that first broke Morrison on the international scene, came in April 1964 when he responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new R&B club at the Maritime Hotel\u00a0\u2013 an old dance hall frequented by sailors. The new R&B club needed a band for its opening night; however, Morrison had left the Golden Eagles (the group with which he had been performing at the time), so he created a new band out of the Gamblers, an East Belfast group formed by Ronnie Millings, Billy Harrison, and Alan Henderson in 1962.

The name came from the character \"Tin Lizzie\" in the comic The Dandy, which in turn came from the nickname for the Ford Model T car. The H was deliberately added to mimic the way the word \"thin\" is pronounced in a Dublin accent. Lynott later discovered the saying attributed to Henry Ford, \"Any colour you like as long as it's black,\" which he felt was appropriate for him.
