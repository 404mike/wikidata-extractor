Anne, Captain Hamilton, and Colonel Frederick F.

For the historic flight, Anne was dressed in royal purple to demonstrate what style of clothing she felt women should wear during a transatlantic flight. Her wardrobe consisted of purple leather knee-breeches, a matching jacket, a black crush hat, black silk stockings, and high-heeled fur-lined boots. Anne's flying suit was similar to those she had worn in previous cup races. The Archbishop of Cardiff blessed the aircraft and its occupants, and following the blessing, Anne discarded her coat and boarded the aircraft."]}, {"page": "List of missing aircraft", "response": ["| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 3(Frederick F.
