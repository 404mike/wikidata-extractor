He grew up on the Cantril Farm housing estate in Liverpool, the youngest of 11 children. \nAs a child and teenager, he was a neighbour of many people who went on to be famous, including footballers Ian Bishop, David Fairclough and Mick Quinn, musicians Paul Rutherford (Frankie Goes to Hollywood), and most members of The Farm, along with actor and comedian Craig Charles.\nMcLoughlin's talent and aggressive riding as a junior and young senior caused excitement in the British cycling press. He turned professional in 1985 and in his second year came 4th in the Dutch one-day classic, the Amstel Gold Race. Riding for the ANC Halfords professional team, he won the 1986 Milk Race following a long attack through the hills and valleys of South Wales on the Carmarthen to Cardiff stage. Despite this early promise his wins were few due to a series of injuries (especially tendinitis) and he was unable to ride the 1987 Tour de France with the ANC team.

His 1982 season started badly: a training crash caused by ice, whilst out in Cheshire, led to a broken femur and this impacted massively on the season ahead. However, in 1982 he still managed arguably his greatest performance finishing second in the Flanders Classics Het Volk. He caught and dropped the breakaway group that included Sean Kelly and Roger De Vlaeminck. However he did not manage to catch the eventual winner Alfons De Wolf, finishing 26 seconds behind. In 1985 he returned home to Britain, riding with John Herety in the British-based professional Ever Ready /Marlboro team. One year later, Graham moved to the British ANC-Halfords team, riding alongside Joey McLoughlin, Paul Watson and Malcolm Elliott. ANC-Halfords were managed by Phil Griffiths and became a surprise inclusion in the 1987 Tour de France.
