In the individual speed skating events, Australia scored only four top 20 finishes from 12 starts, with none higher than 12th, and only one placing in the top half. Kirstie Marshall was in the process of winning the 1992 World Cup series, and was one of the favourites for the women's aerial skiing, which was a demonstration event, but she crash-landed and finished seventh.McAvaney p. 135. Lee managed two top 20 finishes in alpine skiing events, and finished in the top half of the competitors in four events; most of the Australians remained in the bottom half in all of their events. Despite the disappointments of the near-misses, Australia increased their investment in the Winter Olympics, purchasing a training base called Sonnpark in Austria in 1993.", "Short track speed skating has provided the country with many firsts. Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when their relay team won the 5,000\u00a0m race in 1991, which was hosted in Sydney.

They recovered to post a series of strong performances in Lillehammer in 1994. The short track relay yielded Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. The Australians also did well individually; all four representatives finished in the top 13 in at least one of their races, and in the top half in six of their eight events, including top-ten finishes for Steven Bradbury and Richard Nizielski.The Compendium, pp. 221\u2013222."]}, {"page": "Australia at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|align=\"left\" rowspan=2|Steven Bradbury  Richard Goerlitz  Kieran Hansen  Richard Nizielski"]}, {"page": "Australia at the 1992 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Richard Nizielski", "|align=\"left\" rowspan=2|Kieran Hansen  John Kah  Andrew Murtha  Richard Nizielski"]}, {"page": "Australia at the 1994 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|align=\"left\" rowspan=2|Richard Nizielski", "|align=\"left\" rowspan=2|Steven Bradbury  Kieran Hansen  Andrew Murtha  Richard Nizielski"]}, {"page": "List of Australian Winter Olympians", "response": ["* Richard Nizielski: Short track (1992, 1994)"]}, {"page": "Short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|   Steven Bradbury  Kieran Hansen  Andrew Murtha  Richard Nizielski || 7:13.68"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in short track speed skating", "response": ["|Steven BradburyKieran HansenAndrew MurthaRichard Nizielski"]}, {"page": "Kieran Hansen", "response": ["Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but the team crashed in the semi-finals.Andrews, p. 3.Gordon (1994), p. 426.
