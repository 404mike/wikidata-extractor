His widow, Hyacinth, declined the proposal and eventually Hooker's body was buried, as he wished to be, alongside his father in the churchyard of St. Anne's Church, Kew, on Kew Green, within short distance of Kew Gardens.

The plant that had been sent to Kew subsequently flowered, providing the material for Plate 7704 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine published in 1900.

Some two centuries later it has become a popular plant in cold climate gardens, though it is also cultivated throughout the tropics and subtropics. The tree from which the colour plate was made by Matilda Smith, was acquired in 1888 by Kew from a Ghent nurseryman, who believed it to have originated from Madagascar. Besides the Himalayan region, the species also occurs naturally in China in Guangxi, Xizang and Yunnan, also in Myanmar and in Java, Sumatra and Malaysia."]}, {"page": "Francis Blackwell Forbes", "response": ["Due in part to his family's deep involvement with the opium trade, Forbes developed a lifelong interest in the poppy and other plants. In the early 1870s, he took up serious plant collecting and eventually became a leading specialist in Chinese botany. He was president of the Shanghai branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1874, and he published in the Journal of Botany British and Foreign. After moving to  England in the 1880s, he worked on cataloguing the Chinese specimens at Kew Gardens and the British Museum. This led to his capstone work, the multi-volume survey An Enumeration of All the Plants Known from China Proper, Formosa, Hainan, Corea, the Luchu Archipelago, and the Island of Hongkong. His coauthor was the British botanist William Hemsley (who is said to have done the bulk of the work on the later stages of the project, owing to Forbes's time being limited by outside business commitments), and the illustrations were by Matilda Smith. Forbes and Hemsley were the first to describe a number of Chinese species in this work. It met with lavish praise from such contemporary experts on Asian flora as Karl Maximovich and Ferdinand von Richthofen."]}, {"page": "Iris scariosa", "response": ["An illustration of the iris by Matilda Smith was published in Curtis\u2019s Botanical Magazine, vol. 112 [ser. 3, vol. 42] no.6902 in 1886."]}, {"page": "Richmond Cemetery", "response": ["*Matilda Smith (1854\u20131926), botanical artist whose work appeared in Curtis's Botanical Magazine."]}, {"page": "1854 in India", "response": ["*Matilda Smith, botanical artist whose work appeared in Curtis's Botanical Magazine for over forty yearsOgilvie, Marilyn, and Joy Harvey.
