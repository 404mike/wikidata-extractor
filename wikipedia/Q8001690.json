From local football, the club recruited two players who were to play a major role in the future of the club: Bert Lee would have two long periods with the club as a player before becoming a trainer from 1914 to 1935.

With debts of \u00a31,500, Southampton needed to trim their payroll, with Arthur Chadwick joining neighbours Portsmouth, Alf Milward joining New Brompton and Wilf Toman returning to Everton, while Jimmy Yates dropped down into non-league football.", "| Wilf Toman"]}]}}
