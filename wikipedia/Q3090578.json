Elias is credited as an official member of Tears for Fears on those two albums, and appears in six of the band's promotional videos from that era. In addition to that, he has co-writing credits on \"The Way You Are\" and \"The Working Hour\".\nSince parting ways with Tears for Fears in 1986, Elias has provided percussion on albums from such artists as Peter Gabriel, Peter Hammill and Julian Lennon. He was also a member of The Believers, a band that included Gary Tibbs and Andy Skelton, and which released one album in 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Manny Elias (Tears for Fears)"]}, {"page": "Tears for Fears", "response": ["Orzabal and Smith met as teenagers in Bath, Somerset, England.
