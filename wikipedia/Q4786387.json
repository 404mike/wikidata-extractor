The Marquess owned  of land at Turnberry Green, south of Maidens, which was infertile and unsuitable for agriculture, and therefore an ideal golf course location. He realized the new railway would provide easy access for people wanting to visit a quality course. Following the construction of the line, he asked 1883 Open Championship winner Willie Fernie to design a suitable course. Fernie designed an initial round of 13 holes in 1901, with a second-round following later."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire", "response": ["*Archibald Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa 16 November 1919 \u2013 1937"]}, {"page": "1938 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Archibald Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa, aristocrat (born 1847)"]}, {"page": "Angus Kennedy, 6th Marquess of Ailsa", "response": ["Angus Kennedy, 6th Marquess of Ailsa (28 October 1882 \u2013 31 May 1957) was a Scottish peer, the son of Archibald Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa.
