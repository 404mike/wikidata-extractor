Manager Mitten appointed Allchurch as permanent team captain for the start of their season, having commented that he had been impressed by his dedication, and stated in a newspaper interview \"With the maximum wage restriction removed we can afford to pay Allchurch in relation to his value to United, which is tremendous! Tell me where and at what cost can we replace him?\" The abolition of the maximum wage cap had seen Allchurch's wages rise to \u00a360 per week. During the season, Allchurch was one of just two players who appeared in more than 30 matches, along with Dick Keith, as the club rotated players in an attempt to find form. He later resigned from his position as captain after the Newcastle board again attempted to block his call up to the Welsh national side. The death of a prematurely born daughter affected Allchurch's form as he looked after his children during his wife's recovery and the personal difficulty during this period convinced Allchurch to announce his intention to leave the club and move closer to his wider family."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Dick Keith||||RB||1956\u20131964||223||4||"]}, {"page": "Richard Keith (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dick Keith"]}, {"page": "1967 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*28 February - Dick Keith, footballer (born 1933)."]}, {"page": "1933 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*15 May \u2013 Dick Keith, footballer (died 1967)."]}, {"page": "1962 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 3", "response": ["| DF ||align=\"left\"| Dick Keith || 15 May 1933 || 3 || 0 || 270 || 0 || 0 ||bgcolor=red| 90 ||bgcolor=red| 90 ||bgcolor=red| 90 || - ||align=\"left\"|  Newcastle United"]}, {"page": "Ulster Footballer of the Year", "response": ["|  1955\u201356 || ||align=left| Dick Keith || align=left| Linfield|| "]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland national Junior football team", "response": ["The Northern Ireland Junior national football team, commonly referred to as Northern Ireland Juniors, represents Northern Ireland in international association football matches for teams selected outside national professional leagues.
