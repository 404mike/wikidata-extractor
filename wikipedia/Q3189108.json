He then played association football as an amateur, from 1872 to 1876, and was the first foreigner to play in, and the first to win, an FA Cup Final.\nSturgis qualified as a barrister, but he embarked on a writing career in 1874, producing novels, poetry, plays and libretti. He wrote the words for four operas, with music by Arthur Goring Thomas, Arthur Sullivan, Alexander Mackenzie and Charles Villiers Stanford, respectively. He is, perhaps, best remembered as the librettist for Sullivan's 1891 opera Ivanhoe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Sullivan", "response": ["Sullivan wished to produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated with no other librettist since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to The Yeomen of the Guard had \"not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still\". He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, \"I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it.\" Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from Julian Sturgis (who was recommended by Gilbert), and suggested to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful Venice.Jacobs, pp. 282\u2013283 and 288; and Ainger, p. 294 The comic opera was completed first: The Gondoliers (1889) was a piece described by Gervase Hughes as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement.Hughes, p. 24 It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.Ainger, p. 303"]}, {"page": "Yeoman", "response": ["Ivanhoe was transformed into grand opera by Sullivan and Julian Sturgis, who was recommended by Gilbert.

The error appeared to shatter Howard's confidence and he was replaced by Roy Carroll. After a period of rest, Howard reclaimed his starting position ahead of Carroll for the 2004 FA Cup Final, picking up a winner's medal. He was the second American player to collect a winner's medal in the FA Cup, after Julian Sturgis of Wanderers in the 1873 final.

Gilbert to supply the libretto for a grand opera, but Gilbert declined, writing that in grand opera the librettist's role is subordinate to that of the composer, and that the public would, in any case, not accept a serious work from his pen.  Gilbert recommended Julian Sturgis to write the libretto.  Sturgis had written the libretto for Nadeshda by Arthur Goring Thomas (1885), which had been produced with success by Carl Rosa.  Ivanhoe had been treated operatically previously, including an 1826 pastiche opera with music by Rossini and operas by Marschner in 1829, Pacini in 1832 and Nicolai in 1840.  Both Sullivan and the critics noted that Scott's novel, with its many scenes, would make for a complex adaptation.Lamb (1973), p. 476  Sturgis set to work on Ivanhoe in the spring or early summer of 1889.  The libretto uses some of the language directly from the novel and does not change the basic story.  However, in condensing the lengthy and action-packed novel for a stage work, the libretto relies on the audience's knowledge of the novel and omits many scenes, also entirely omitting the characters of Gurth the Swineherd, Oswald, Cedric's manservant, some of King John's advisors, and Athelstane the Unready, among others.  Richard Traubner, writes in Opera News, that \"Sturgis's libretto, given his quotes from Scott and the quasi-medieval English, is still sketchy, and the complex story does not really move forward with any operatic satisfaction.\""]}, {"page": "1873 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| FW || || Julian Sturgis "]}, {"page": "1876 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The Etonian team also included Julian Sturgis, who had been born in the U.S. and was the first foreign-born player to appear in the Cup Final (discounting those born to British parents in the British Empire),Warsop, p.\u00a0128 as well as Arthur Kinnaird, who had captained Wanderers to victory in the 1873 FA Cup Final.Warsop, p.\u00a093 Wanderers began the match with two full-backs, two half-backs and six forwards, while the Etonians opted for one full-back, two half-backs and seven forwards.", "|FW || ||Julian Sturgis ", "|FW || ||Julian Sturgis "]}, {"page": "History of the FA Cup", "response": ["In 1872, Edward Ernest Bowen of Ireland became the first non-Englishman to win the FA Cup.
