He was also an expert in psychometrics and carried out extensive research in the statistical analysis of personality and intelligence.\nIn his 1972 book Fact and Fantasy in Freudian Theory, widely translated, he brought these two interests together, examining the objective evidence for various ideas of Freudian theory, finding that some, but not all, were supported by the evidence. He also wrote introductory books to psychometrics, for example An easy guide to factor analysis (1994).  He was a prolific author, writing or editing at least 14 books, and over 150 scientific papers are listed under his name in Web of Science.\nKline was originally educated in classics, in education, and in statistics: he studied at the University of Reading, University College Swansea, the University of Aberdeen and the University of Manchester.  When he first joined the University of Exeter, it was as a staff member in the university's then Institute of Education.  However, in 1969 he joined the Department of Psychology as a Lecturer, rising eventually to become the university's first Professor of Psychometrics.  Among colleagues, Kline had a reputation as an opinionated controversialist who remained a genial and supportive colleague; he was revered by students for the wit and clarity of his lectures.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Klein", "response": ["*Paul Kline (1937\u20131999), psychologist", "*Paul Kline (photographer) (born 1964), American photographer"]}, {"page": "List of University of Exeter people", "response": ["*Paul Kline, Psychology"]}, {"page": "Kline (surname)", "response": ["* Christopher Paul Kline (b. 1979), American musician known as \"Vertexguy\" or \"the Vertex Guy\"", "* Paul Kline (1937\u20131999), British academic psychologist"]}, {"page": "The Foundations of Psychoanalysis", "response": ["The philosopher Thomas Nagel argued that Gr\u00fcnbaum neglects \"the distinctively inner character of psychological insight\". The philosopher John Forrester described Gr\u00fcnbaum's understanding of science as ahistorical and unrealistic, and argued that Gr\u00fcnbaum misunderstood Freud's view of psychoanalysis. He accused Gr\u00fcnbaum of quoting Freud selectively to support his case, and of ignoring passages in Freud's writings that suggested a hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis. The psychologist Michael Billig noted that, in contrast to Gr\u00fcnbaum, psychologists such as Seymour Fisher, Roger P. Greenberg, and Paul Kline, \"argue that the main elements of Freudian theory have been confirmed.\" The psychotherapist D. Patrick Zimmerman wrote that Gr\u00fcnbaum's conclusions about psychoanalysis have been applied by others to psychodynamic and other forms of verbal psychotherapy. He wrote that critical responses to Gr\u00fcnbaum have not had the same effect on the public as criticism of Freud. He argued that while Gr\u00fcnbaum's arguments were \"bolstered by a reliance upon techniques and findings extrapolated from the field of physics ... his positions were sometimes flawed by basic misunderstandings about either the methods or the conclusions of physics\", and that Gr\u00fcnbaum's criticisms of psychoanalysis applied only to \"classical Freudian\" views and not to more recent \"psychodynamic conceptions\". The philosopher Paul Fusella credited Gr\u00fcnbaum with exposing some of the weaknesses of Habermas's and Ric\u0153ur's interpretations of psychoanalysis. Though maintaining that psychoanalysis \"remains relevant\", he argued that the book left it unclear whether psychoanalysis would be considered pseudoscientific or an empirical science."]}, {"page": "Freud and Philosophy", "response": ["However, Freud and Philosophy has received criticism from psychologists such as Hans Eysenck, Glenn Wilson, and Paul Kline, who have attributed to Ric\u0153ur the view that psychoanalysis either cannot or should not be evaluated in terms of experimental evidence. Eysenck and Wilson described Freud and Philosophy as a good example of a defense of psychoanalysis against the claim that it should be so evaluated. They argued that Ric\u0153ur espoused a form of \"extreme subjectivism\" which implies that psychoanalytic theories cannot be tested empirically or shown to be mistaken. They suggested that Freud would have rejected Ric\u0153ur's conclusions and that few psychologists or psychoanalysts would accept them. They also argued that if Ric\u0153ur's conclusions were to be accepted, this would further undermine psychoanalysis. Kline wrote that Ric\u0153ur might be correct that psychoanalysis cannot be dealt with through experiments based on quantifiable evidence, but argued that if he is, this shows that psychoanalytic theory is not scientific. The sociologist John Thompson considered Ric\u0153ur's views about the role of language and meaning in psychoanalysis similar to those of Lacan. While Thompson praised Freud and Philosophy, he believed that Ric\u0153ur failed to resolve the \"question of the scientific status of psychoanalysis\" in the work. He and Ric\u0153ur both noted that Ric\u0153ur took a different approach to the issue in his essay \"The question of proof in Freud's psychoanalytic writings\", which was published in Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences (1981)."]}, {"page": "Kline, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Kline"]}]}}
