The episodes explore the themes of addiction, faith, sex and body image. The programme presents both behaviours and treatments which Dr Byron is able to explore objectively but with some common sense cynicism. Is having sex with 5000 men within the range of normal behaviour? Is being attracted to pre-pubescent girls okay if you don't act on that attraction in a way that harms or coerces them? Are sex addiction or addiction to computer games real physiological addictions? Is hearing God different to hearing voices? These are the questions that she explores, without yielding to the temptation to give easy answers. This was based on the radio series presented by Vivienne Parry."]}, {"page": "St Swithun's School, Winchester", "response": ["*Vivienne Parry (born 1956), journalist and author"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Menzies Campbell, Germaine Greer, Clare Short, Andrew Lansley, Vivienne Parry"]}, {"page": "Vivienne Mary Hunt Parry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vivienne Parry"]}, {"page": "Am I Normal?", "response": ["Am I Normal? is a programme which is broadcast on Radio Four, presented by Vivienne Parry."]}, {"page": "Daphne Jackson Trust", "response": ["Professor Dame Athene Donald DBE, Ms Vivienne Parry OBE, Ms Maggie Philbin OBE.
