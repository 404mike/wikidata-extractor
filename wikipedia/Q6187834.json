In 1914 the Independent Labour Party Housing Committee and the Women's Labour League formed the Glasgow Women's Housing Association. Under the leadership of Mary Barbour, Mary Laird, Helen Crawfurd, Mary Jeff and Jessie Stephen the Glasgow Women's Housing Association became the driving force behind the rent strike that started in May 1915 in the industrialised area of Govan. Tenants refused to pay the latest increase in rents and staged mass demonstrations against evictions, resulting in violent confrontations. With the start of the First World War local young men left Glasgow to serve in the army overseas, and the first violent protest in the Govan district took place in April to resist the eviction of a soldier's family. As evictions were repeatedly attempted with support from the police, women attacked the factors and the sheriffs' men."]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["thumb|120px|Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09812, Jessie Stephen no-text", "* Jessie Stephen \u2013 (1893\u20131979) \u2013 working class suffragette and trade union activist"]}, {"page": "History of the Labour Party (UK)", "response": ["Elections for the Women's Sections were carried out by postal ballot in 1931.
