She worked for the London Evening Standard from 1958 conducting interviews with many prominent musicians of the era, including Bob Dylan and John Lennon. Over 50 years, she continued to interview people in all walks of life, in the Standard, the Telegraph Magazine, Observer Magazine, Saga magazine, Intelligent Life magazine, and elsewhere.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Lennon", "response": [" In March 1966, during an interview with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon remarked, \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink... We're more popular than Jesus now \u2013 I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later. The furore that followed, which included the burning of Beatles records, Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against Lennon, contributed to the band's decision to stop touring."]}, {"page": "The Beatles", "response": ["Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \"Christianity will go\", Lennon had said. \"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\" His comments went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed them five months later, it sparked a controversy with Christians in America's conservative Bible Belt region. The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context. At a press conference, Lennon pointed out, \"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\" He claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\""]}, {"page": "1966", "response": ["**In an interview with London Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, John Lennon of The Beatles states \"We're more popular than Jesus now\"."]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["While arranging dates for the band's world tour, Epstein agreed to a proposal by journalist Maureen Cleave for the Beatles to be interviewed separately for a series of articles that would explore each of the band members' personality and lifestyle beyond his identity as a Beatle. The articles were published in weekly instalments in London's Evening Standard newspaper throughout March 1966, and reflected the transformation that was underway during the group's months of inactivity. Of the two principal songwriters, Cleave found Lennon to be intuitive, lazy and dissatisfied with fame and his surroundings in the Surrey countryside, while McCartney conveyed confidence and a hunger for knowledge and new creative possibilities. In his book Revolver: How the Beatles Reimagined Rock 'n' Roll, Robert Rodriguez writes that, whereas Lennon had been the Beatles' dominant creative force before Revolver, McCartney now attained an approximately equal position with him. In a further development, Harrison's interest in the music and culture of India, and his study of the Indian sitar, had inspired him as a composer. According to author Ian Inglis, Revolver is widely viewed as \"the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter\".", "Edward Greenfield of The Guardian titled his review \"Thinking Pop\" and wrote that the three Beatles songwriters \"habitually go outside the realm of sloppy love-theme, and find inspiration instead (as serious artists always must) in specific feelings and specific experiences\". Highlighting the importance of McCartney's classical aesthetic, he recognised the band's ongoing success as \"fair vindication\" for popular taste in terms of its alignment with artistic merit. In their joint review for Record Mirror, Richard Green and Peter Jones found the album \"full of musical ingenuity\" yet \"controversial\", and added: \"There are parts that will split the pop fraternity neatly down the middle.\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). In the Evening Standard, Maureen Cleave named Revolver and the August 1966 single as the year's best records, although she rued that, together with Mick Jagger, the Beatles had become aloof in that, \"Unlike anybody else, they seemed to know what they wanted.\""]}, {"page": "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)", "response": ["The song's lyrics are about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was involved in, as hinted in the opening couplet: \"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.\" Although Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either Lennon's close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term \"Norwegian Wood\" was an ironic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue in London. McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: \"In our world the guy had to have some sort of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental.\""]}, {"page": "Taxman", "response": ["Aside from the financial imposition, \"Taxman\" was informed by Harrison's consternation that the vast sums the Beatles paid in tax were being used to fund the manufacture of military weapons. Harrison voiced this concern in his \"How a Beatle Lives\" interview with Maureen Cleave of the Evening Standard, in late February, in addition to railing against all forms of authority and speaking out against the Vietnam War. He likened Wilson to the Robin Hood character the Sheriff of Nottingham."]}, {"page": "A Hard Day's Night (song)", "response": ["On 16 April 1964, the Beatles gathered at Studio 2 of the EMI Studios and recorded \"A Hard Day's Night\". It took them less than three hours to polish the song for its final release, eventually selecting the ninth take as the one to be released.  Evening Standard journalist Maureen Cleave described a memorable taxi ride the morning the song was recorded:"]}, {"page": "Cynthia Lennon", "response": ["In 1965, she opened the front door of Kenwood to see a man who \"looked like a tramp\", but with her husband's features. He explained that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling her for the first time that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fianc\u00e9e, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fianc\u00e9e then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, \"Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me\"."]}, {"page": "I'm Only Sleeping", "response": ["The first draft of Lennon's lyrics for \"I'm Only Sleeping\", written on the back of a letter from 1966, suggests that he was writing about the joys of staying in bed rather than any drug euphoria sometimes read into the lyrics. While not on tour, Lennon would usually spend his time sleeping, reading, writing or watching television, often under the influence of drugs, and would have to be woken by McCartney for their songwriting sessions. In a London Evening Standard article published on 4 March 1966, Maureen Cleave, a friend of Lennon, wrote: \"He can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England. 'Physically lazy,' he said. 'I don't mind writing or reading or watching or speaking, but sex is the only physical thing I can be bothered with any more.'\""]}, {"page": "Think for Yourself", "response": ["Writing in The Guardian on the 50th anniversary of the album's release, Bob Stanley described \"Think for Yourself\" as \"cool but fierce\". He grouped it with \"Norwegian Wood\" and \"Girl\" as songs that conveyed the Beatles' new, sophisticated outlook at the time and, decades later, evoked progressive women such as Edie Sedgwick, Maureen Cleave and Pauline Boty. He said that the same three songs were statements that ensured that Rubber Soul would remain \"fresh\" for another 50 years. Also writing in December 2015, Emily Mackay of the NME described the song as \"acerbic\" and empathetic with the confused sexual politics of \"Norwegian Wood\". She recognised Harrison's \"assertion of independent-mindedness\" as a forerunner to Lennon's 1968 song \"Revolution\". In his 2015 book 1965: The Most Revolutionary Year in Music, Andrew Grant Jackson identifies it as the Beatles' contribution to a \"subgenre\" of protest songs that emerged in 1965, in which artists railed against \"oppressive conformity itself\" rather than political issues. He views it as one of the musical statements that, informed by mass media, hallucinogenic drugs and the introduction of the contraceptive pill, \"chronicled and propelled a social reformation as the old world forged its uneasy synthesis with the new\"."]}, {"page": "Eleanor Rigby", "response": ["The NME chose \"Eleanor Rigby\" as its \"Single of the Year\" for 1966. Melody Maker included the song among the year's five \"singles to remember\", and Maureen Cleave of The Evening Standard recognised the single and Revolver as the year's best records in her round-up of 1966. At the 9th Annual Grammy Awards in March 1967, \"Eleanor Rigby\" was nominated in three categories, winning the award for Best Contemporary (R&R) Vocal Performance, Male or Female for McCartney. In his television show Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution, which aired in April, American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein championed the Beatles' talents among contemporary pop acts and highlighted the song's string arrangement as an example of the eclectic qualities that made 1960s pop music worthy of recognition as art."]}, {"page": "Love You To", "response": ["Harrison wrote \"Love You To\" in early 1966 while the Beatles were enjoying an unusually long period free of professional commitments, due to their inability to find a suitable film project. He used the available time to further explore his interest in Indian music and the sitar, which, journalist Maureen Cleave noted in a contemporary article, \"has given new meaning to [his] life\". Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Aside from honeymooning in Barbados with his wife, English model Pattie Boyd, Harrison's activities included receiving sitar tuition from an Indian musician at the Asian Music Circle (AMC) in north London, where he also attended music recitals, and seeing Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar perform at the Royal Festival Hall. As reflected in \"Love You To\", Harrison continued to immerse himself in recordings by Shankar, who, when the pair met in June 1966, would agree to take Harrison as his student. This meeting took place at the home of the AMC's founders, Ayana and Patricia Angadi, whose network of friends and visitors added to Harrison's self-education in new forms of art, culture and politics.", "Writing in the recently launched Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams \"heaped praise\" on \"Love You To\", according to Rodriguez. The majority of contemporary US reviews were lukewarm towards Revolver, however, in reaction to the publication of Lennon's comment to Maureen Cleave that the Beatles had become more popular than Christ. An exception was New York critic Richard Goldstein, who praised the album as \"a revolutionary record\", and later wrote that the song's lyrics \"exploded with a passionate sutra quality\". Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). While bemoaning the initial lack of recognition for Revolver, KRLA Beats reviewer said that Harrison had \"created a new extension of the music form which he introduced in Rubber Soul\", and described \"Love You To\" as \"Well done and musically valid. Also musically unrecognized.\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required)."]}, {"page": "Yellow Submarine (song)", "response": ["Author Steve Turner writes that in its focus on childhood themes, \"Yellow Submarine\" fitted with the contemporaneous psychedelic aesthetic, and that this outlook was reflected in George Harrison's comments to Maureen Cleave in his \"How a Beatle Lives\" interview, when he spoke of an individual's purity at birth and gradual corruption by society. Cleave likened his perspective to a contention put forward in William Wordsworth's poetry. In Many Years from Now, McCartney says he \"started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived\" and that the story line became gradually more obscure.", "Donovan later said that \"Yellow Submarine\" represented the Beatles' predicament as prisoners of their international fame, to which they reacted by singing an uplifting, communal song. In November 1966, artist Alan Aldridge created a cartoon illustration of \"Yellow Submarine\" and three other Revolver tracks to accompany a feature article on the Beatles in Woman's Mirror magazine. The illustration depicted the submarine as a large boot with the captain peering out from the top. The article, which drew from Maureen Cleave's interviews with the band members from early in the year, was flagged on the cover in a painting by Aldridge that showed the Beatles ensnared by barbed wire under a giant speech balloon reading: \"HELP!\""]}, {"page": "More popular than Jesus", "response": ["In March 1966, London's Evening Standard ran a weekly series titled \"How Does a Beatle Live?\" that featured John Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison and Paul McCartney. The articles were written by Maureen Cleave, who knew the group well and had interviewed them regularly since the start of Beatlemania in the United Kingdom. She had described them three years earlier as \"the darlings of Merseyside\", and in February 1964 had accompanied them on their first visit to the United States. She chose to interview the band members individually for the lifestyle series, rather than as a group."]}, {"page": "See My Friends", "response": ["In his interviews at the time of the song's release, Ray Davies told journalists Maureen Cleave and Keith Altham that \"See My Friends\" was about homosexuality. He told Cleave that it was \"about being a youth who is not sure of his identity\", a feeling he had experienced, and recalled that he once said to wife Rasa, \"If it wasn't for you, I'd be queer.\" He has also said the song concerns the death of his elder sister, Rene, who lived for a time in Ontario, Canada. On returning to England, she fell ill owing to an undiagnosed hole in her heart and died while dancing at a nightclub. Just before Rene died, according to Davies, she gave him his first guitar for his thirteenth birthday."]}]}}
