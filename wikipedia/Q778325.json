The album was successful in the UK, Germany and several other countries, producing a string of hits including \"A Kind of Magic\", \"Friends Will Be Friends\", \"Princes of the Universe\" and \"Who Wants to Live Forever\"; the latter featuring an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. The album was less successful in North America, reaching 46 in the US, and was described by biographer Mark Blake as \"a so-so album\" and \"a somewhat uneven listening experience\"."]}, {"page": "Genesis (band)", "response": ["Genesis stayed at Wotton until April 1970, by which time they had enough new material for a second album. Recording for Trespass began in June at Trident Studios in London, with Anthony as producer and David Hentschel hired as assistant engineer. The album included longer and more complex songs than their first, blending folk and progressive rock elements with various time signature changes, as in the nine-minute song \"The Knife\". Trespass is the first in a series of three Genesis album cover designs by Paul Whitehead. He had completed the design before the band decided to include \"The Knife\" on the album. Feeling the cover no longer reflected the album's overall mood, the band persuaded Whitehead to slash a knife across the canvas and have the result photographed. Released in October 1970, Trespass reached No. 1 in Belgium in 1971 and No. 98 in the UK in 1984. \"The Knife\" was released as a single in May 1971. Rolling Stone briefly mentioned the album with a negative view following its 1974 reissue: \"It's spotty, poorly defined, at times innately boring\". \"Genesis seemed to be dying a death around our second album\", Gabriel told Mark Blake. \"We couldn't get arrested. So I got a place at the London School of Film Technique.\""]}, {"page": "Camel (band)", "response": ["Despite no new studio releases since 2002, the band performed on tour as recently as 2018.

In June 2021, Waters released a statement announcing a new release with stereo and 5.1 surround mixes. Waters cited a dispute between himself and Gilmour over a set of liner notes written by Mark Blake as the reason for the delay, and posted the rejected liner notes on his website.

Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989, and said about the composition: \"I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, Berlioz and Borodin\u00a0...\u00a0This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music.\" Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would \"take in stride\", a sign Pink Floyd biographer Mark Blake believes is \"a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy\".  reached number 5 on the Billboard Classical Music Chart in the United States."]}, {"page": "Crowd surfing", "response": ["\"Iggy Pop had jumped into an audience prior to me,\" Gabriel explained to Mark Blake, \"but he hadn't done that thing of lying on the hands and being carried around by the audience. I had the idea from a game you did with a therapy group where you had to fall backwards and trust the person behind to catch you. I was always interested in closing the gap between the performer and the audience. At an open-air show in Chicago I was passed around and returned to the stage minus every piece of clothing except my underpants. There was an edge to doing it and part of you was praying you'd get back to the stage in one piece.\""]}, {"page": "A Kind of Magic", "response": ["In a retrospective review, Greg Prato of AllMusic wrote: \"It may not have been as cohesive as some of their other albums, but A Kind of Magic was their best work in some time\". Queen biographer Mark Blake wrote: \"The album's confused origins made for a somewhat uneven listening experience... only the title cut and 'Who Wants to Live Forever' were songs that would survive the album's natural shelf life.

It's like being right-handed and having to learn to write with your left.\" In an interview for Genesis: The Sum Of The Parts, Collins confirmed he was amenable to the request, but admitted asking Gabriel what he was supposed to do with his other hand.", "\"Atlantic Records didn't want to put it out at all\", Gabriel told Mark Blake. \"Ahmet Ertegun said, 'What do people in America care about this guy in South Africa?' and 'Has Peter been in a mental hospital?' because there was this very weird track called 'Lead a Normal Life'. They thought I'd had a breakdown and recorded a piece of crap\u00a0... I thought I'd really found myself on that record, and then someone just squashes it. I went through some primordial rejection issues.\""]}, {"page": "New Boots and Panties!!", "response": ["Critical reviews of the 40th anniversary box set in 2017 continued to praise the album. Terry Staunton of Uncut called New Boots and Panties!! \"a calling card that dabbled in jazz, music hall, retro rock'n'roll and Kinks-ian character studies. [Dury] could have been dismissed as a Dickensian cartoon, were it not for the eloquence of his lyrics, his sly humour and the formidable musical range of his partner Chaz Jankel, whose playful arrangements brought depth and ballast to the odd-looking bloke at the mic.\" He concluded that neither of Dury's following two albums on Stiff Records \"could match his debut's invention and charm\". Record Collectors Daryl Easlea described the 40th anniversary edition as \"a joy to behold\" and that New Boots and Panties!! \"remains a truly singular album full of magic and wonder. No small thanks to its coterie of characters, real and imaginary, that Dury brought along to so capture the imagination.\" Mark Blake of Q said, \"You can hear late-'70s London all over these songs... Yet New Boots... is more than a period piece. It has endured. Punk's DIY ethos and rejection of conventional pop star glamour enabled Ian Dury rather than dictated to him. The man and his songs were too contrary to fit into any box or era.\" Summing up the record, he stated, \"Forty years on, New Boots and Panties!! has lost few of its brilliant imperfections\"."]}, {"page": "Hands Clean", "response": ["While choosing the song as a highlight from Under Rug Swept, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic compared its lyrics to her earlier hit \"You Oughta Know,\" also noting that \"this would all seem calculated, an attempt to regain her chart status, if Morissette wasn't so unabashedly earnest, seemingly unembarrassed by her confessions.\" Stephen Thompson from The A.V. Club praised the track for being \"a breezy new single\" and \"infectious enough to surpass the direst moment of 'Under Rug Swept.'\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song \"could even be seen as a sequel to 'You Oughta Know,'\" while Nikki Tranter of Popmatters compared the lyrical content on the song to her previous songs \"Plastic\" and \"Jealous,\" from her first album, Alanis.
