Yet he played only eleven times for England, was dropped after making a century in 1949, and was never selected to face Australia.Born in Chiswick, London, England, it was Robertson\u2019s misfortune to be overshadowed by others, both in his international and county cricket career. He came to prominence in wartime cricket for the Army when he scored 102 in July 1942 against the Royal Navy. For the first half dozen years of cricket after World War II, England's preferred opening partnership was the trans-Pennine combination of Leonard Hutton and Cyril Washbrook; Robertson's selection for the first Test of 1949 against New Zealand was the result of injury to Washbrook and, despite scoring 121 and sharing a partnership of 143 with Hutton, he lost his place.For Middlesex, Robertson often seemed similarly overshadowed by the batting of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich. Yet in the summer of 1947, when Compton\u2019s 3,816 runs and Edrich\u2019s 3,539 set new records for run-getting, Robertson was not far behind, making 2,760 runs with 12 centuries. He surpassed that in 1951 with 2,917 runs, the highest aggregate of any batsman that season. He could also bat as entertainingly as his better-known county colleagues. In 1949, he made an undefeated 331 in a day against Worcestershire at New Road, Worcester, an innings that remains the highest scored in first-class cricket by a Middlesex batsman, and the highest first-class innings by any batsman at New Road.\nRobertson passed 1,000 runs in a season every year from 1946 until 1958 but, failing to find any form in 1959, he retired and became county coach.\nHe was one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1948.He died in October 1996, in Bury St Edmunds after years of ill-health, at the age of 79, and leaving a widow, Joyce, and a son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chiswick", "response": ["Notable people born before the Second World War include the cricketers Patsy Hendren (1899\u20131962) and Jack Robertson (1917\u20131996), the novelist Iris Murdoch (1919\u20131999) who lived on Eastbourne Road, the theatre and film director Peter Brook (1925\u2013\u00a0), zoologist and broadcaster Aubrey Manning (1930\u20132018), and marine geologist Frederick Vine (1939\u2013\u00a0).

The latter had made 74 and 70 for Nottinghamshire against Australia and had impressed observers with his display, and was made twelfth man."]}, {"page": "Sid Barnes with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["The following match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were almost a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. For players on both sides, it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught John Deighton and Jack Robertson and took 0/15 from four overs. During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at short leg, with one foot on the edge of the cut strip. According to retired Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, himself a former fielder in the leg trap, \"[Barnes\u2019s position] was the closest I have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side\". Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman Len Hutton was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to hook Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck bowling aimed at his upper body. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence.Perry (2008), pp. 68\u201369. Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, as though he were about to place it down on the batting surface, which was against the laws of cricket. Umpire Frank Chester, who was also known for his flamboyance and penchant for making himself visible, at one point held up proceedings momentarily when Barnes feigned to put his foot on the surface as the bowler was preparing to deliver the ball.Perry (2008), pp. 74\u201375."]}, {"page": "History of cricket in Pakistan from 1947 to 1970", "response": ["MCC had a strong team that featured the young Tom Graveney and Brian Statham.

Hampshire returned the following season to play a second first-class match against Middlesex, which Middlesex won by an innings and 25 runs, following scores of 97 by Jack Robertson and 118 by Bill Edrich.
