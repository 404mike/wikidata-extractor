He was born in Harborne, Birmingham, and died in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire.\nSmith was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he played in the cricket eleven as a middle-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who could also bowl leg breaks. His single first-class match was the game between Warwickshire and Yorkshire in May 1905, a run-heavy game that petered out to a dull draw; he made one run in his only innings and bowled nine overs, conceding only 13 runs but failing to take a wicket. A contemporary report of the match refers to him as \"the Harborne colt\" and singles him out from the Warwickshire bowlers for his control: \"A bowler who seemed less easy to score from than any one else on the home side was Mr. Irving W. Smith ... who, bowling with breaks from leg, kept a consistently good length.\" Smith was not, however, selected for any further county games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Irving Smith (1905) : I.
