A microculture \u2013 whether formed by a racetrack, a university, a holiday camp or a pub \u2013 can be seen as having its own social micro-climate, with values and norms of behaviour of its own, to an extent differing from those of the general culture.Kate Fox, Watching the English (2004) p. 89 Such micro-climates are situational, specific to their own circumstances.Paul Stephens/Andrew Leach, Think Sociology (1998) p. 207 For instance, although a pub is considered part of the English culture, it also contains its own microculture wherein one can find a structured and temporary relaxation of social norms. The same is true in the case of a racetrack where spectators from all social classes converge amid a relaxation of the constraints of respectability.
