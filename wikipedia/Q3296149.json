Butler argues that one measure of a conservative writer is \"whether the plot, broadly, suggests a victim suffering at the hands of society\". Butler argues that Austen's novels are so structured, and thus conservative. She divides Austen's works into two kinds: stories involving a \"Heroine who is Right\" and a spokeswoman for conservative orthodoxy, and stories involving a \"Heroine who is Wrong\" who must learn from her mistakes by recognizing them and resolving to do better. In the novels in which the \"Heroine is Right\", the same process of error, self-knowledge and resolve to follow reason is present, but in another principal character or characters. The \"Heroine who is Right\" helps bring about the change in these other characters.Butler, 165\u2013167. Butler contends that \"Austen's stress upon her heroines' subordinate role in a family, upon their dutifulness, meditativeness, self-abnegation and self-control, were codes shared with other conservative writers, especially women moralists such as Jane West and Mary Brunton. The acquiescent heroine challenges the hero or heroine of novels of the 1790s by reformists such as Bage, Godwin, Holcroft, Hays, and Wollstonecraft, who insist on thinking independently and speaking out.\""]}, {"page": "Canongate Kirkyard", "response": ["Prof Very Rev Alexander Brunton (1772\u20131854), Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 1823.
