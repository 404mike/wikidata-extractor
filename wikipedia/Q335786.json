Canning passed the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 which was drafted by his predecessor  Lord Dalhousie before the rebellion. He also passed the General Service Enlistment Act of 1856.After the rebellion he presided over a smooth transfer and reorganisation of government from the East India company to the crown,  the Indian Penal Code was drafted in 1860 based on the code drafted by Macaulay and came into force in 1862. Canning met the rebellion '\"with firmness, confidence, magnanimity and calm\" as per his biographer. Canning was very firm during the rebellion but after that he focused on reconciliation and reconstruction rather than retribution and issued a clemency proclamation.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zanzibar", "response": ["In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman moved his capital from Muscat, Oman to Stone Town.
