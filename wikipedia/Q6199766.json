During the 1919\u201320 season he was part of the last Southern League representative XI, playing in a fixture against Corinthians. At the end of the 1919\u201320 season Reading, along with most of the Southern League clubs, formed the Third Division of the Football League. Andrews spent the first season of the new division with Reading before returning to Southampton in August 1921. During his second spell at Reading, Andrews formed a \"exciting partnership\" with Jimmy Carr on the left-wing, which was to be briefly re-created at Southampton a few years later."]}, {"page": "Cliff Price", "response": ["In December 1923, Price joined Southampton, immediately taking over from Len Andrews in the No.10 shirt. His debut came when he replaced Henry Johnson in a 2\u20131 victory at South Shields on 22 December 1923, Saints' first away win of the season. Price was described in the local press as \"an inside-left of the studious type\", whose passes were usually well-judged. He immediately struck up an understanding with his left-wing partner Jimmy Carr before, in January, injury put Carr out of the game for the rest of the season, with Elias MacDonald replacing him."]}, {"page": "Fred Price (footballer)", "response": ["After four seasons at Filbert Street, where he was considered to be a \"clever player\", Price moved to the south coast to join Southampton in May 1924 along with half-back Dennis Jones as part of an exchange deal that saw full-back Harry Hooper move in the opposite direction. At The Dell, Price briefly formed a left-wing partnership with his uncle Cliff Price in the early part of the 1924\u201325 season, before the return of Jimmy Carr. Price was unable to break back into the side and in May 1925 he asked for a transfer."]}, {"page": "Frank Matthews (footballer)", "response": ["Matthews initially played in the reserves but made his Southampton debut away to Sheffield Wednesday on 12 December 1925, when he replaced the out of favour Cliff Price at inside-left.
