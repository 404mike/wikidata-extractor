He also represented the Welsh national team over 30 times and is regarded as one of Wales' best ever players.\nBrought up in the Rhondda Valley, Paul became a miner after leaving school, but an offer of a professional contract from Swansea gave him the opportunity to leave the colliery. His football career was then disrupted by Second World War, during which he was a physical training instructor. After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948\u201349. Transfer listed after an abortive move to Colombian club Millonarios, Paul joined Manchester City for \u00a319,500 in June 1950.\nAt Manchester City Paul spent seven years as captain, leading the club to successive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956, losing the first and winning the second. In 1957 he became player-manager of Worcester City, and subsequently wound down his career in his native South Wales, becoming a lorry driver. He died in 2002 aged 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester City F.C.", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Roy Paul                || MF (half back)"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 in English football", "response": ["*21 May 2002: Roy Paul, 82, played 270 league games in defence for Manchester City during the 1950s after signing from Swansea, and collected an FA Cup winner's medal in 1956.

This allowed Allchurch and a number of other youth players, including Terry Medwin and John King to establish themselves in the squad, Allchurch becoming the youngest player in the club's history to be ever present during an entire season, having played in every league game for the club, during the 1950\u201351 season. Further approaches from Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester City were also rejected by the Swans. However, the side struggled to perform in the Second Division, finishing in 18th and 19th positions between 1950 and 1952, and Allchurch contemplated a move away from Vetch Field after being encouraged by some teammates at international level to move to a First Division side."]}, {"page": "Rhondda", "response": ["Although association football was not so popular as rugby in the Rhondda in the early 20th century, after the 1920s several notable players emerged from the area. Two of the most important came from the village of Ton Pentre; Jimmy Murphy was capped 15 times for Wales, and in 1958 managed both the Welsh national team and Manchester United. Roy Paul, also from Ton Pentre, led Manchester City to two successive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956 and gained 33 Welsh caps. Alan Curtis, who was best known for representing Swansea City and Cardiff City, came from the neighbouring village of Pentre, and in an 11-year international career won 35 caps for Wales, scoring six goals."]}, {"page": "Andy Morrison", "response": ["Morrison was signed by Joe Royle for Manchester City, in the 1998\u201399 season, following their relegation to Division Two. The transfer fee was \u00a380,000. Morrison made his debut in a 2\u20131 victory against Colchester United in October 1998. Morrison headed in City's second goal of the game and received a man of the match award, which was presented to him by former City winger Dennis Tueart. Morrison also scored in his second game for City, a 3\u20130 victory against Oldham Athletic. Morrison endeared himself to the City fans and was soon made captain. He scored his third goal for City in a 1\u20131 draw with Luton Town. One fanzine asked: \"Where can we get another half-dozen Andy Morrisons?\" According to goalkeeper Nicky Weaver: \"Morrison was a huge signing for us. Joe made him captain straight away. He was an intimidating figure for the opposition and he could be intimidating as a team-mate as well. I'd stand behind him in the tunnel and he'd be beating his chest, ready for battle. The other team would be thinking, 'I don't fancy tangling with him today'. But to be fair to Andy, he wasn't just a brute and growling pitbull. He had a great touch, too.\" In an 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon, in the FA Cup, Morrison was sent off after a scuffle with Carl Cort. Morrison scored his fourth goal of the season, via a thundering header from a corner, in a 6\u20130 victory against Burnley (Shaun Goater scored a hat trick and Kevin Horlock and Danny Allsopp scored the other goals). City finished in the play-off places in the league. Morrison captained City to victory over Gillingham in the 1999 Football League Second Division play-off Final at Wembley in May 1999.  In the match Morrison's teammates Kevin Horlock and Paul Dickov scored late goals to take the match to extra time and penalties (which City won). Morrison was presented with the playoff trophy at the end of the game and became the fifth City captain (following Sam Cowan, Roy Paul, Tony Book and Mike Doyle) to lift a trophy at Wembley. He has been succeeded, in this respect, by Carlos Tevez (who captained City to victory in the 2011 FA Cup Final) and Vincent Kompany (who has won the EFL Cup four times with City), although they captained City to victories at the new Wembley Stadium.", "Morrison is remembered by Manchester City fans as one of their best-ever captains, and was voted so in the club's official magazine. Only Roy Paul and Tony Book were deemed to be better captains than him. The magazine also listed Morrison second in a list of hard men, behind Mike Doyle but above the likes of Stuart Pearce and Gerry Gow. Some feel that it was Morrison's leadership skills and ability to get the players around him to raise their game that enabled Manchester City to return to the Premier League after their fall into Division Two. In an interview with the BBC on 23 September 2005, Joe Royle spoke of his sympathy for Nottingham Forest, a club which, like Manchester City, had fallen two divisions. He said, \"Big clubs in that division are a scalp and everyone wants to beat them. We had that at City and it was hard for us, but we got the hang of it. The catalyst for us was signing Andy Morrison. He was the man for the job and the man for the division. He dragged us up kicking and screaming. He is the kind of player that Forest need \u2013 if they can find somebody like him. We only got him because of his injury record, and because he had had a major fall-out with the manager at Huddersfield. He was as strong as they come and feared nobody \u2013 he played a big part in turning things round for us.\""]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*21 May \u2013 Roy Paul, footballer (born 1920)"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Roy Paul||  || Half back || 1950\u20131957||294||9|| ||", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Roy Paul || half back || player || 1950\u20131957 ||"]}, {"page": "Ken Barnes (English footballer)", "response": ["By the late 1950s Barnes was one of the senior players in the side, and succeeded Roy Paul as captain when Paul retired in 1957.The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame p.\u00a0171 During the 1957\u201358 season Barnes became the third player to score a hat-trick of penalties in an English top-flight match, as part of a 6\u20132 defeat of Everton.Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p.\u00a0186 At this time Barnes was the club's primary penalty taker, helping him to score 11 goals over the course of the season.

The next attack, in the third minute, resulted in the opening goal. Revie began the move, exchanging passes with Clarke, and back-heeling for the unmarked Hayes to sweep the ball past Gil Merrick to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's confidence was shaken, resulting in a series of Manchester City corners and a chance for Hayes, but they fought back to equalise in the 15th\u00a0minute.

Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead.Whittell, Manchester City Greats, p.\u00a021. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near.
