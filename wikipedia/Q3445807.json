He also represented the Welsh national team over 30 times and is regarded as one of Wales' best ever players.\nBrought up in the Rhondda Valley, Paul became a miner after leaving school, but an offer of a professional contract from Swansea gave him the opportunity to leave the colliery. His football career was then disrupted by Second World War, during which he was a physical training instructor. After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948\u201349. Transfer listed after an abortive move to Colombian club Millonarios, Paul joined Manchester City for \u00a319,500 in June 1950.\nAt Manchester City Paul spent seven years as captain, leading the club to successive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956, losing the first and winning the second. In 1957 he became player-manager of Worcester City, and subsequently wound down his career in his native South Wales, becoming a lorry driver. He died in 2002 aged 82.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
