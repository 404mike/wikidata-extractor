He replaced Glen Matlock, who had fallen out of favour with the other members of the group.\nLikely due to intravenous drug use, Vicious was hospitalized with hepatitis during the recording of the Sex Pistols' only studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols; his bass is only partially featured on one song, \"Bodies.\" Vicious later appeared as a lead vocalist, performing three songs, on the soundtrack to The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (1980), a largely fictionalised documentary about the Sex Pistols.\nAs the Sex Pistols were gaining attention, Vicious met Nancy Spungen, and the couple began a relationship that culminated in Spungen's death from an apparent stab wound while staying in New York City's Hotel Chelsea with Vicious. Under suspicion of murder, Vicious was released on bail; he was arrested again for assaulting Todd Smith, brother of Patti Smith, at a nightclub, and underwent drug rehabilitation on Rikers Island. He died in 1979 after overdosing on heroin.\nLess than four weeks after Vicious's death, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle soundtrack album was released. On 15 December 1979, a compilation of live material recorded during his brief solo career was released as Sid Sings. Gary Oldman portrayed Vicious in the biopic Sid and Nancy (1986).

In addition to the T-shirt, and leather jackets they wore ripped jeans and boots, typically Doc Martens. The punk look was inspired to shock people. Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look\u2014and reputed invention of the safety-pin aesthetic\u2014was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario Malcolm McLaren and, in turn, British punk style.Strongman (2008), pp. 58, 63, 64; Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 78. (John D Morton of Cleveland's Electric Eels may have been the first rock musician to wear a safety-pin-covered jacket.)See  McLaren's partner, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, credits Johnny Rotten as the first British punk to rip his shirt, and Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious as the first to use safety pins, although few of those following punk could afford to buy McLaren and Westwood's designs so famously worn by the Pistols, so they made their own, diversifying the 'look' with various different styles based on these designs. Young women in punk demolished the typical female types in rock of either \"coy sex kittens or wronged blues belters\" in their fashion.Habell-Pallan, Michelle (2012). \"Death to Racism and Punk Rock Revisionism\", Pop: When the World Falls Apart: Music in the Shadow of Doubt. p. 247-270.

The former proved much more influential on female fan styles.See, e.g., Laing (1985), \"Picture Section,\" p. 18. Over time, tattoos, piercings, and metal-studded and -spiked accessories became increasingly common elements of punk fashion among both musicians and fans, a \"style of adornment calculated to disturb and outrage\".Wojcik (1997), p. 122. Among the other facets of the punk rock scene, a punk's hair is an important way of showing their freedom of expression. The typical male punk haircut was originally short and choppy; the mohawk later emerged as a characteristic style.Wojcik (1995), pp. 16\u201319; Laing (1985), p. 109.

There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors, while Sex store frontwoman Jordan not only managed Adam and the Ants but also performed screaming vocals on their song \"Lou\".

Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night.

In February 1977, the first album by a British punk band appeared: Damned Damned Damned (by the Damned) reached number thirty-six on the UK chart.

Meanwhile, the Oi! and anarcho-punk movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, \"The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.\u00a0...

From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the \"Bromley Contingent\", as most of them came from the Bromley area in south east London, a label Severin came to despise. \"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \"The Lord's Prayer\"."]}, {"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist John Lydon (known at the time by his stage name \"Johnny Rotten\"), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", the latter of which attacked Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they popularised punk rock in the UK. \"God Save the Queen\" was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the \"most heavily censored record in British history\".", "The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen. Early line-ups of The Strand\u2014sometimes known as The Swankers\u2014also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass.Savage, Jon. England's Dreaming, pp. 77\u201379; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 84.

McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the '50s rocker look associated with Marlon Brando. As John Lydon later observed, \"Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto.\"Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 83.

He was also credited with introducing the pogo dance to the scene at the 100 Club. John Robb claims it was at the first Sex Pistols residency gig, 11 May 1976; Matlock is convinced it happened during the second night of the 100 Club Punk Special in September, when the Pistols were off playing in Wales.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 159\u2013160; Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, p. 130.

Five years later, Lydon filed another action.

That same year, a fictionalised film account of Vicious's relationship with Spungen was released: Sid and Nancy, directed by Alex Cox. In his autobiography, Lydon lambastes the film, saying that it \"celebrates heroin addiction\", goes out of its way to \"humiliate [Vicious's] life\", and completely misrepresents the Sex Pistols' part in the London punk scene.Lydon, John, Rotten, pp. 148\u2013149.", "Along with their abundant musical influence, the Sex Pistols' cultural reverberations are evident elsewhere.

By the age of twenty-one, Sid Vicious was already a \"t-shirt-selling icon\".Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 235. While the manner of his death signified for many the inevitable failure of punk's social ambitions, it cemented his image as an archetype of doomed youth.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 530. British punk fashion, still widely influential, is now customarily credited to Westwood and McLaren; as Johnny Rotten, Lydon had a lasting effect as well, especially through his bricolage approach to personal style: he \"would wear a velvet collared drape jacket (ted) festooned with safety pins (Jackie Curtis through the New York punk scene), massive pin-stripe pegs (modernist), a pin-collar Wemblex (mod) customised into an Anarchy shirt (punk) and brothel creepers (ted).\"Douglas, Mark, \"Fashions, Youth\", pp. 188\u2013189. Quote: Jon Savage, in Mulholland, Neil, The Cultural Devolution, p. 72. Christopher Nolan, director of the Batman movie The Dark Knight, has said that Rotten inspired the characterization of The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. According to Nolan, \"We very much took the view in looking at the character of the Joker that what's strong about him is this idea of anarchy. This commitment to anarchy, this commitment to chaos.\" ", "Music historian Simon Reynolds argues that McLaren came into his own as an auteur only after the group's break-up, with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and the recruitment of Ronnie Biggs as a vocalist. Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren's onscreen proclamations in the film, whether lending them credence or not. As music journalist Dave Thompson noted in 2000, \"[T]oday, Swindle is viewed by many as the truth\"Thompson, Dave, Alternative Rock, p. 135.

Temple points out that McLaren's characterization was intended as \"a big fucking joke\u2014that he was the puppetmeister who created these pieces of clay from plasticine boxes that he modeled away and made Johnny Rotten, made Sid Vicious. It was a joke that they were completely manufactured.\"Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:24\u20131:40.

Spike's first act in Sunnydale is to attack Buffy and a large group of people at her school, making his first appearance the deadliest of any of Buffys \"Big Bads\", as he very nearly kills Buffy, but Buffy's mother distracts Spike long enough for Buffy to recover. Throughout season 2, Spike and Dru are the canon's most prominent example of affection between vampires, displaying the humanity and intricacies of vampire relationships. Spike was initially conceived as a disposable villain to be killed off, but proved so popular with fans that Joss Whedon decided to merely injure him instead, in the episode \"What's My Line, Part Two\", in which Spike is crushed by a collapsing pipe organ and left paralyzed.

Only spoke with singer Dave Vanian about the possibility of the Misfits touring the United Kingdom with The Damned. That November the band released the Night of the Living Dead single and flew to England to tour with The Damned. Upon arriving there, however, they learned that Vanian had not taken his conversation with Only seriously and had not planned on having the Misfits on the tour. Vanian attempted to arrange for the Misfits to take part in the tour, but the band members were unhappy with the situation and left the tour after only two shows. Image then quit the band and flew back to the United States. With their return flight not scheduled until late December, the remaining band members stayed in London. Only spent time with Sid Vicious' mother, Anne Ritchie, whom he had befriended after Vicious' death in February 1979. Danzig and Steele got into a fight with skinheads while waiting to see The Jam, were arrested, and spent two nights in jail in Brixton.  This experience inspired the later song \"London Dungeon\". Although in an interview on podcast San Clemente Punk, Bobby Steele tells a completely different version of the events."]}, {"page": "Public Image Ltd", "response": ["Upon returning to England, Lydon approached Jah Wobble (n\u00e9 John Wardle) about forming a band together. The pair had been friends since the early 1970s when they attended the same school in Hackney (both belonged to a circle of friends Lydon informally dubbed \"The Gang of Johns\" \u2013 John Lydon, John Wardle, John Gray, and Simon John Ritchie/Beverley, a.k.a. Sid Vicious). Lydon and Wobble had previously played music together during the final days of the Sex Pistols. Both had similarly broad musical tastes, and were avid fans of reggae and world music. Lydon assumed, much as he had with Sid Vicious, that Wobble would learn to play bass guitar as he went.  Wobble would prove to be a natural talent. Lydon also approached guitarist Keith Levene, with whom he had toured in mid-1976, while Levene was a member of the Clash. Lydon and Levene had both considered themselves outsiders even within their own bands. Jim Walker, a Canadian student newly arrived in the UK, was recruited on drums, after answering an ad placed in Melody Maker.", "The single \"Public Image\" was widely seen as diatribe against Malcolm McLaren and his perceived manipulation of Lydon during his career with the Sex Pistols. The track \"Low Life\" (with its accusatory lyrics of \"Egomaniac traitor\", \"You fell in love with your ego\" and \"Bourgeoisie anarchist\") has also been regarded as an attack on McLaren, although Lydon has stated that the lyrics refer to Sid Vicious. The two-part song \"Religion\" refers contemptuously to Roman Catholicism; Lydon came up with the lyrics when he was part of the Sex Pistols but he claims the other members of the band were reluctant to use them. The closing track \"Fodderstompf\", heavily influenced by dub, comprises nearly eight minutes of a circular bass riff, played over a Lydon/Wobble double act lampooning public outrage, love songs and teenage apathy. The track culminates with the sound of a fire extinguisher being let off in the recording studio with Wobble heard saying \"I will show our frustration at society by picking up that fire extinguisher over there and spraying it at the mic\".", "Later in 1980, Jah Wobble left the band and was not formally replaced. The resulting album was notable for its almost complete lack of bass parts. Martin Atkins, who had initially joined at the tail end of the Metal Box sessions, was re-recruited to drum on The Flowers of Romance. Levene had by then largely abandoned guitar in favour of synthesiser, picking up a new technique although owing a debt to Allen Ravenstine of Pere Ubu. Atkins' propulsive marching band-style drumming, the lack of bass and guitar, and Lydon's increasing lyrical abstraction made this LP a difficult listen for rock fans, and contemporary reviews expressed great confusion. The record consists mostly of drums, vocals, musique concr\u00e8te, and tape loops, with only gestures toward bass (played by Levene) and keyboards. The title \"Flowers of Romance\" was the name of a short-lived band featuring Keith Levene, Viv Albertine, and Sid Vicious in 1976. The track \"Francis Massacre\" was partially inspired by Lydon's incarceration in Mountjoy Prison and the track \"Hymie's Him\" began life as an instrumental piece intended for the score of Michael Wadleigh's 1981 werewolf film Wolfen."]}, {"page": "List of suicides", "response": ["* Sid Vicious (1979), English musician and member of the Sex Pistols, heroin overdose."]}, {"page": "The Stooges", "response": ["*The Sex Pistols recorded the first high-profile Stooges cover, \"No Fun\", in 1976.
