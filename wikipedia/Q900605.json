The view of military-focused historians is that licensing restricted the number of fortifications that could be used against a royal army. The modern view, proposed notably by Charles Coulson, is that battlements became an architectural status-symbol much sought after by the socially ambitious, in Coulson's words: \"Licences to crenellate were mainly symbolic representations of lordly status: castellation was the architectural expression of noble rank\". They indicated to the observer that the grantee had obtained \"royal recognition, acknowledgment and compliment\". They could however provide a basic deterrent against wandering bands of thieves, and it is suggested that the function of battlements was comparable to the modern practice of householders fitting highly visible CC-TV and burglar alarms, often merely dummies.

By 1950, molecular orbitals were completely defined as eigenfunctions (wave functions) of the self-consistent field Hamiltonian and it was at this point that molecular orbital theory became fully rigorous and consistent. This rigorous approach is known as the Hartree\u2013Fock method for molecules although it had its origins in calculations on atoms. In calculations on molecules, the molecular orbitals are expanded in terms of an atomic orbital basis set, leading to the Roothaan equations. This led to the development of many ab initio quantum chemistry methods. In parallel, molecular orbital theory was applied in a more approximate manner using some empirically derived parameters in methods now known as semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods."]}, {"page": "Coulson", "response": ["*Charles Coulson (1910\u20131974), British applied mathematician, theoretical chemist and religious author"]}, {"page": "William Daniel Phillips", "response": ["He is one of three well-known scientists and Methodist laity who have involved themselves in the religion and science dialogue.

Specifically, Walter Heitler determined how to use Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation (1926) to show how two hydrogen atom wavefunctions join together, with plus, minus, and exchange terms, to form a covalent bond.
