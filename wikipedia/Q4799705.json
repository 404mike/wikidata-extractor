He is best known for The Harmsworth Self-Educator, The Children's Encyclop\u00e6dia, The Children's Newspaper, and The King's England. The tone is looking back to the years immediately after the Great War, even during publication of volumes in the 1940s. He produced other works, most of which had what would today be described as an overly patriotic tone, particularly when discussing the countryside or subjects from history.", "link_mentions": {}}}
