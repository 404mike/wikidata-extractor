Keith Murray, the Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, telephoned him to invite him to a meeting. At this meeting, Murray indicated that a fellowship and tutorship in law had become vacant following Harold Hanbury's appointment as Vinerian Professor of English Law, and that he wished to offer it to Goff. Goff, astonished, asked for half an hour to consider the proposal. In apparent surprise that Goff needed to think about the offer, Murray granted the time, following which Goff accepted the offer, on condition that he could first sit the Bar exams and be called to the Bar. Murray agreed to this and Goff was called by Inner Temple in 1951. In October 1951, he began teaching at Lincoln College, and remained there until the end of the 1954\u201355 academic year. Alongside his teaching, he served on various committees and briefly as dean in 1952\u201353 when the incumbent was on leave. His students included Swinton Thomas, who would become a judge of the Court of Appeal."]}, {"page": "Harold Greville Hanbury", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harold Hanbury"]}]}}
