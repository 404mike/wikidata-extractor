Graham later moved onto the coaching staff at Blundell Park and following the dismissal of manager Lennie Lawrence and his assistant John Cockerill in 2001, the new Town boss Paul Groves appointed Rodger as his new Assistant Manager. Graham was then given the managerial position on a caretaker basis when Groves was sacked in 2004. In his first game in charge of the club, The Mariners defeated local rivals Barnsley 6\u20131, with 4 goals coming from the ever-popular Phil Jevons. However, despite the good form under Rodger he was overlooked for the job and it in turn went to Nicky Law. With Grimsby suffering relegation to League Two a few months later, Law lost his job, and in stepped Russell Slade. On 5 June 2006, Rodger would finally get his break, and was appointed as the club's full-time manager, when Slade departed to join Yeovil Town. However, his managerial career was not a happy one, and after a poor start to the season he was sacked on 5 November after five months in charge, with Grimsby hoping for promotion, the club found itself in the bottom third of the table. His replacement was to be Alan Buckley who in turn brought Rodger back to then club again as the Sports in the Community Officer, a previous position he had held from 1999 to 2001. Former Town midfielder Gary Childs was also given the same job. On 6 July 2017, he was appointed as chief scout for Grimsby."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Gary Childs||||MF||1989\u20131996||233||26"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Childs"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Childs"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Childs"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Neil", "response": ["Neil, a native of the Suffolk town of Bury St Edmunds started his professional football career as a junior at Grimsby Town.
