This recounts the story of a wife imprisoned by her husband. The stage directions included details designed to improve the Gothic situation. Litchfield was complimented for her delivery \"in the most perfect manner\", but she plays a woman denied any human contact and kept in a modern dungeon. She is not mad but realises that she will soon be a maniac. The play is thought to have been suggested by one of Mary Wollstonecraft's books. It was said that even the staff of the theatre left in horror. The play was only staged once."]}, {"page": "Mary Ann Yates", "response": ["There were benefit performances for Yates in 1797 at The Haymarket which included an appearance by Harriett Litchfield.K.
