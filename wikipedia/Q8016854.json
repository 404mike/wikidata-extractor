J. (1900) A literal transcript of the earliest register of Dale Abbey, Derbyshire, p. 1.

The Peculiar kept the fees competitive to draw in couples from nearby parishes and the fees were contributed to poor relief. This arrangement was partly disrupted by the Marriage Act 1753, which made the presence of an authorised Anglican minister necessary.
