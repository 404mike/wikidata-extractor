He was also capped by Scotland, making nine appearances between 1872 and 1879, scoring five goals. As a player, he was described as \"a brilliant dribbling artist\".\n\nMacKinnon was the only player who appeared in all of the first seven official international matches between Scotland and England, making him the first caps record holder in international football history. He held the Scotland record until March 1881, when Henry McNeil earned his 10th cap.\nOutside the game he was an ironworks engineer and had a great interest in music with a talent for singing.", "link_mentions": {}}}
