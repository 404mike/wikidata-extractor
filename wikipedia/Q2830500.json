The club became a Manchester legend in its own right, being known variously as the Russell Club, Caribbean Club, PSV (Public Service Vehicles) Club (so titled as it was originally a social club for bus drivers who worked from the nearby depot) and 'The Factory'. The \u2018Factory\u2019 night at The Russell Club was launched by Alan Erasmus, Tony Wilson, and helped by promoter Alan Wise. The name 'Factory' was chosen in homage to the New York club of the same name. As well as attracting numerous touring bands to the area and many upcoming post punk bands, it featured local bands including the Durutti Column (managed at the time by Erasmus and Wilson), Cabaret Voltaire from Sheffield and Joy Division. The club was demolished in 2001. The club was located on the NE corner of the now demolished Hulme Crescents development, on the corner of Royce Rd and Clayburn St ().

It had several successful acts, including Slaughter & the Dogs (whose tour manager was Rob Gretton), John Cooper Clarke, and Jilted John. After his seminal TV series So It Goes, Tony Wilson was interested in the way Rabid Records ran, and was convinced that the real money and power were in album sales.
