He attended the local chapel from a young age, and probably acquired most of his early education during Sunday School classes. He was admitted a full member of the church at the age of 20, before being invited to begin preaching at 24. Encouraged and helped by his friends he attended a school in Shrewsbury, before joining the Academy at Llanfyllin. His style of preaching was popular and attracted attention. He accepted an appointment at Edmund Street Church in Liverpool in 1817, before a move to the Tabernacle, Great Crosshall Street.\nJohn married Margaret Williams (1801-1879) in 1823. The marriage produced six children. Margaret was the younger sister of Liberal MP for Merioneth,  David WilliamsHis reputation as a preacher was far reaching, causing him to become quite famous throughout Wales.
