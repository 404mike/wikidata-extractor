His groundbreaking work in the 1920s and 1930s on reaction mechanisms and the electronic structure of organic compounds was responsible for the introduction into mainstream chemistry of concepts such as nucleophile, electrophile, inductive and resonance effects, and such descriptors as SN1, SN2, E1, and E2. He also was a co-author of the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog priority rules. Ingold is regarded as one of the chief pioneers of physical organic chemistry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog priority rules", "response": ["The Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog (CIP) sequence rules, named for organic chemists Robert Sidney Cahn, Christopher Kelk Ingold, and Vladimir Prelog \u2014 alternatively termed the CIP priority rules, system, or conventions \u2014 are a standard process used in organic chemistry to completely and unequivocally name a stereoisomer of a molecule. The purpose of the CIP system is to assign an R or S descriptor to each stereocenter and an E or Z descriptor to each double bond so that the configuration of the entire molecule can be specified uniquely by including the descriptors in its systematic name. A molecule may contain any number of stereocenters and any number of double bonds, and each usually gives rise to two possible isomers. A molecule with an integer n describing the number of its stereogenic centers will usually have 2n stereoisomers, and 2n\u22121 diastereomers each having an associated pair of enantiomers. The CIP sequence rules contribute to the precise naming of every stereoisomer of every organic and organometallic molecule with all atoms of ligancy of fewer than 4 (but including ligancy of 6 as well, this term referring to the \"number of neighboring atoms\" bonded to a center).The \"usually\" has its basis in the fact that molecules with chiral centers nevertheless may have mirror planes of symmetry, e.g. meso compounds, that make some of the stereoisomers \"degenerate\" (identical), so that this mathematical expression overestimates the number.
