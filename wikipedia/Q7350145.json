In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdales longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby).

Sandie also leaves the village for Scotland, and Robert loses contact with his maternal family.

Christopher Smith remained in the role for twelve years between 1989 and 2001, making him the longest actor to play the character.

Sugden. 2007. \"Collective Intentions and Team Agency,\" The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 104, No. 3, 109-137. For example, in many simple games analyzed by game theory, the players are counted as acting jointly when they achieve the Nash equilibrium, even though that equilibrium state is neither optimal nor achieved cooperatively. In the prisoner's dilemma, the Nash equilibrium occurs when each player defects against the other, even though they would both do better if they cooperated."]}, {"page": "Susana Mourato", "response": ["In conjunction with the UK Department of Transport, Susana Mourato along with co-authors Ian Bateman, Richard Carson, Brett Day, Michael Hanemann, Nick Hanley, Michael Jones-Lee, Graham Loomes, Ece Ozdemiroglu, David Pearce (economist), Robert Sugden (economist), and John Swanson compiled a manual used for guiding stakeholders to assess and evaluate the monetary values of such usage and impacts from ecosystem services. The book suggests using stated preference techniques to determine the value of non-market goods and environmental effects for cost\u2013benefit analysis. Within the book, the chapters are divided into several focuses including: economic values, measurement and techniques of economic values, stages of stated preference work and organizing the results. The authors outline the steps necessary to conduct a stated preference study by using two alternate methods: choice modelling and contingent valuation. These surveying methods concentrates on the willingness to pay by consumers and with the collected sample data to be analyzed through various statistical tests. The manual is recommended for assessing data values in policy decision making."]}]}}
