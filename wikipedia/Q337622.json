About  in front of the French defenders, the 1st Hussars of the King's German Legion and the 23rd Light Dragoons unwittingly charged into a hidden stream bed which toppled many horses and tumbled many riders to the ground. Hastily reforming, the Germans and the left wing of the 23rd LD charged the French infantry drawn up in squares, were repulsed and withdrew. Drake's and Allen's squadrons on the right wing of the 23rd LD rode past the squares and charged Merlin's cavalry brigade. The 10th and 26th Chasseurs in the front line drew aside and allowed the British cavalry to gallop past. The two British squadrons struck the Westphalians in the second line, then were attacked from behind by the 10th and 26th Chasseurs.
