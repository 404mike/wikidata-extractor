Initially a schoolteacher and a jazz enthusiast, he played trumpet in The Mighty Joe Young Jazz Men and the 1960s pop group The Alan Price Set before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1967, where he was John Peel's producer from 1969 to 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Peel", "response": ["Peel's enthusiasm for music outside the mainstream occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the then station controller Derek Chinnery contacted John Walters and asked him to confirm that the show was not playing any punk, which he (Chinnery) had read about in the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.", "Between 1995 and 1997, Peel presented Offspring, a show about children, on BBC Radio 4. In 1998, Offspring grew into the magazine-style documentary show Home Truths. When he took on the job presenting the programme, which was about everyday life in British families, Peel requested that it be free from celebrities, as he found real-life stories more entertaining. Home Truths was described by occasional stand-in presenter John Walters as being \"about people who had fridges called Renfrewshire\". Peel also made regular contributions to BBC Two's humorous look at the irritations of modern life Grumpy Old Men. His only appearances in an acting role in film or television were in Harry Enfield's Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era as John Past Bedtime, and in 1999 as a \"grumpy old man who catalogues records\" in the film Five Seconds to Spare. However, he had provided narration for others.\"Keeping it Peel\", BBC Radio 1, 30 September 2007. Retrieved 30 September 2007.", "After separation from his first wife, Peel's personal life began to stabilise, as he found friendship and support from new Top Gear producer John Walters\u2014and from his girlfriend Sheila Gilhooly, whom he identified on-air as \"the Pig\". Peel married Sheila on 31 August 1974. The reception was in London's Regent's Park, with Walters as best man. Peel wore Liverpool football colours (red) and walked down the aisle to the song \"You'll Never Walk Alone\". Their sheepdog, Woggle, served as a bridesmaid. Rod Stewart and Graham Chapman attended.", "At one point, he said that if he died before his producer John Walters, he wanted the latter to play Roy Harper's \"When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease\". Walters having died in 2001, it was left to Andy Kershaw to end his tribute programme to Peel on BBC Radio 3 with the song. Peel's stand-in on his Radio 1 slot, Rob da Bank, also played the song at the start of the final show before his funeral. Another time, Peel said he would like to be remembered with a gospel song. He stated that the final record he would play would be the Rev C. L. Franklin's sermon \"Dry Bones in The Valley\".", "Peel wrote that \"The Festive 50 dates back to what was doubtless a crisp September morning in the early-to-mid Seventies, when John Walters and I were musing on life in his uniquely squalid office. In our waggish way, we decided to mock the enthusiasm of the Radio 1 management of the time for programmes with alliterative titles. Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy Radio Times billing. In the course of our historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, when I could have been out and about having fun, fun, fun.\"Peel, J., \"Bang Bang hits the tops\", The Times (London), , 2 January 1993, Features section p. SR.12."]}, {"page": "Keith Moon", "response": ["Early in the Who's career, Moon got to know the Beatles. He would join them at clubs, forming a particularly close friendship with Ringo Starr. Moon later became friends with Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band members Vivian Stanshall and \"Legs\" Larry Smith, and the trio would drink and play practical jokes together. Smith remembers one occasion where he and Moon tore apart a pair of trousers, with an accomplice later looking for one-legged trousers. In the early 1970s Moon helped Stanshall with his \"Radio Flashes\" radio show for BBC Radio 1, filling in for the vacationing John Peel.

Travis agreed to cut their song \"Hand in Glove\" as a single. For the cover, Morrissey insisted on a homoerotic photograph by Jim French which he had found in Margaret Walters' The Nude Male. The single was released in May 1983, and sold well for the next 18 months, although did not chart in the UK Top 40. Among the audience at the Smiths' second London concert, at the University of London Union, was John Walters, the producer of John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show; he invited the band to record a session for the program. Peel said: \"You couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\" Following this radio exposure, the Smiths gained their first interviews, in the music magazines NME and Sounds."]}, {"page": "Vivian Stanshall", "response": ["Thanks to his association with Peel, Stanshall was asked to fill in for the disc jockey while he was on a month's holiday. The resulting short series, entitled Vivian Stanshall's Radio Flashes, was recorded under the supervision of Peel's regular producer John Walters and broadcast on BBC Radio One in August 1971. The series of four two-hour programmes were a mix of music and specially written and recorded comedic sketches. Out of the original four episodes, only episodes 2, 3 and 4 remain in the BBC archives, and these were re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2014 and again in 2016. However, since the 1970s, all four episodes and a Christmas 1971 compilation special have circulated among collectors as low-quality, edited off-air recordings. Contributors to the sketches in Radio Flashes included Moon, Traffic's Jim Capaldi and actress Chris Bowler. The sketches included a four-part serial adventure titled \"Breath From The Pit\", featuring the surreal exploits of a Dick Barton or Bulldog Drummond-style gentleman adventurer, Colonel Knutt (played by Stanshall) and his working-class sidekick, the 'likeable cheeky cockney, Lemmy'. The serial was also partly a parody of Charles Chilton's Journey into Space, with Moon playing the role of Lemmy."]}, {"page": "Victor Lewis-Smith", "response": ["On 30 May 1988, his first programme for BBC Radio 1, with producer John Walters, under the pseudonym Steve Nage was broadcast, parodying the Simon Bates-style mid-Atlantic delivery of Radio 1 disc jockeys of the time."]}, {"page": "Led Zeppelin Boxed Set", "response": ["All tracks produced by Jimmy Page except for \"Travelling Riverside Blues\" produced by John Walters and \"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\" produced by Jeff Griffin."]}, {"page": "Andy Kershaw", "response": ["Room 318 of Egton House was to house Kershaw, Peel and their mentor, producer John Walters, whose Reithian motto was, \"We're not here to give the public what it wants.
