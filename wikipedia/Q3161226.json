The samples in An Empty Bliss Beyond This World's first tracks are the most prominent. Surrounding these samples are vinyl scratches and click and pop sounds that, in the words of Savage, are \"steampunk glitches.\" All of the sounds become more filtered in echo as each track goes on. It is unknown if Kirby added these echo filters or if they are a part of the original recordings, which Savage interpreted as giving the LP an \"affective\" vibe. As the album progresses, the samples become more fragmented and unnoticeable, the sounds stop staying at both stereo channels, and the tracks become shorter. Thus, as Savage wrote, \"the experience begins to fall apart.\" This is all until \"Camaraderie at Arms Length,\" which starts a clear repeat of the music sources heard in the LP's early tracks that ends the album.", "An Empty Bliss Beyond This World was the Caretaker's breakthrough album.Richardson, Mark (27 January 2012). \"The Caretaker: Patience (After Sebald)\".

The official soundtrack album was issued on 23 January 2012. Unlike other albums of The Caretaker that used old recordings of playful and bright ballroom music, Kirby's score for the film uses a 1927 record of Franz Schubert's piano-and-voice-only composition Winterreise (1828) as its main audio source. It also differs from other works of the project where hissing sounds are used instead of crackles, the loops are shorter in lengths, and the non-musical aspects of each track (the hiss sounds) serve as the foreground of the mix. The soundtrack was favorably received by professional music journalists."]}]}}
