He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. He was born in Horsforth, Leeds, where he played cricket for Horsforth Cricket Club.\nLinley went to St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston. He started his first-class career with Oxford University, for whom he played for two years. The Oxford team at the time included Joe Sayers (with whom Linley went to school and who is now at Yorkshire), Michael Munday (Somerset) and Viv Richards' son Mali. He also represented Combined Universities. During this time, his scalps included Scott Newman (his maiden first-class wicket), Adam Hollioake, James Benning, Darren Bicknell, Jason Gallian, Russell Warren, Mark Richardson (New Zealand touring side), Michael di Venuto, Jonathan Moss and Jehan Mubarak (Sri Lankan touring side).\nLinley moved to Sussex in 2005, ostensibly as a 'prize' after winning the London County Cricket Club 'search for a star' competition, although rumour has it the contract had already been agreed previously. It did not prove to be a happy pairing. There were few opportunities for Linley in Sussex's championship winning side and his appearances were restricted to the second XI, the tourists game (Sri Lanka) and the Twenty20 challenge.\nLinley then made the occasional appearance for Middlesex Second XI and had an extended run with Surrey second XI in 2008 including a five-wicket haul (seven in the match) against Kent.\nHe played for Surrey in the final two Twenty20 group matches of the 2009 season but was wicketless in both.\nBy 2011, Linley had established himself as a regular in the Surrey First XI, having survived Chris Adam's clear-out of many Surrey players by taking 20 wickets in the 2010 season (backed up by a further 23 for Surrey Second XI). On 8 February 2011 he signed a new two-year deal with the club, and later recorded his career-best figures of 6/57 against Leicestershire on 25 August 2011 (with figures of 9/79 in the match).\nIn September 2015 he announced that he was retiring because of injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linley", "response": ["* Tim Linley (born 1982), British cricketer"]}, {"page": "St Mary's Menston Catholic Voluntary Academy", "response": ["* Tim Linley, professional cricketerAcademic and sporting excellence for former St Mary's students at Oxford , school-portal.co.uk; accessed 14 January 2018."]}, {"page": "Timothy Linley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tim Linley"]}, {"page": "Joe Leach", "response": ["While studying French and Philosophy at the University of Leeds, Leach made his first appearance for Leeds/Bradford MCCU in 2011. The England and Wales Cricket Board conferred first-class status on Leeds/Bradford MCCU in 2012, with Leach making his first-class debut against Surrey at The Oval. In Surrey's first-innings of 385 all out, Leach took figures of 4/78 from thirteen overs, the best bowling figures of the innings. In Leeds/Braford MCCU's first-innings response, Leach was dismissed for a duck by Tom Jewell. In their second-innings, he recorded his maiden first-class half century with a score of exactly 50, before being dismissed by Tim Linley. Leeds/Bradford MCCU narrowly lost the match by 2 runs. "]}]}}
