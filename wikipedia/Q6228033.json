Starr is buried in King's Chapel Burying Ground, Boston.\nOn January 1, 1680, John Cutt became the first president of the royal Province of New Hampshire, when New Hampshire was first separated from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Cutt was the head of the seven-member royal provincial council. An early copy of the document appointing Cutt and his council is now preserved by the State of New Hampshire.Soon after his appointment he fell ill. On March 1, 1681, the provincial Council and General Assembly designated March 17, 1681, as a Fast Day, \"A day of public fasting and prayer.\" The Council and Assembly believed Cutt's illness and the recent sighting of a comet were signs of \"divine displeasure\"; the fast day was unsuccessful, as John Cutt died on April 5, 1681.After his Cutt's death, Richard Waldron was named acting president.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fast Day", "response": ["A Fast Day could be added for any particular reason in a particular year, rather than being instituted as an ongoing annual holiday.

The following year, when illness struck John Cutt, the president of the Province of New Hampshire, and a comet was seen in the sky, the province designated March 17, 1681 a Fast Day in response to these signs of \"divine displeasure\".  The image at right shows that Jonathan Belcher, colonial governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, declared a Fast Day in 1735 because of \"the holy Anger of Almighty God, evidently manifested in the various judgments inflicted on us\", specifically highlighting a \"mortal sickness\" that had been divinely inflicted on the colonists."]}, {"page": "Governor of New Hampshire", "response": ["Traditionally, the governors of the colonial Province of New Hampshire were titled as \"President of New Hampshire\", beginning with the appointment of the province's first president, John Cutt, in 1679.

In 1641 the communities were organized under the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, until Charles II issued a colonial charter for the province and appointed John Cutt as President of New Hampshire in 1679.  After a brief period as a separate province, the territory was absorbed into the Dominion of New England in 1686. Following the collapse of the unpopular Dominion, on October 7, 1691 New Hampshire was again separated from Massachusetts and organized as an English crown colony. Its charter was enacted on May 14, 1692, during the coregency of William and Mary, the joint monarchs of England, Scotland, and Ireland.  Between 1699 and 1741, the province's governor was often concurrently the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.  This practice ended completely in 1741, when Benning Wentworth was appointed governor. Wentworth laid claim on behalf of the province to lands west of the Connecticut River, east of the Hudson River, and north of Massachusetts, issuing controversial land grants that were disputed by the Province of New York, which also claimed the territory.  These disputes resulted in the eventual formation of the Vermont Republic and the US state of Vermont.", "Because of a general lack of government, the New Hampshire settlements sought the protection of their larger neighbor to the south, the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  In 1641, they collectively agreed to be governed from Massachusetts, provided the towns retained self-rule, and that Congregational Church membership was not required for their voters (as it was in Massachusetts).  The settlements formed part of that colony until 1679, sending representatives to the Massachusetts legislature in Boston.  Mason's heirs were in the meantime active in England, seeking to regain control of their territory, and Massachusetts was coming under increasing scrutiny by King Charles II.

He was commissioned by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England to study the Indian languages and to preach to the Indians; but he was soon diverted from this work.

In the 1730s New Hampshire political interest led by Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth were able to raise the profile of these issues to colonial officials and the crown in London, even while Governor and Massachusetts native Jonathan Belcher preferentially granted land to Massachusetts interests in the disputed area.
