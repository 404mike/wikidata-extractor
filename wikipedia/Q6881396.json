Danielewski, and Don Delillo, as well as to theories of perception \u2013 based on the dislocation of time and place through travel \u2013 espoused by Wolfgang Schivelbusch and Mitchell Schwarzer.Kathleen MacQueen, \u201cNayda Collazo-Llorens: The Consistency of Chaos,\u201d a companion essay to the exhibition An Exercise in Numbness & Other Tales, Richmond Center for Visual Arts, September 6-October 5, 2012, unpaginated. Her interest in the non-hierarchical, rhizomatic arrangement of data is reflective of Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s emphasis on the nomadic nature of knowledge: \u201cTo be rhizomorphous is to produce stems and filaments that seem to be roots, or better yet connect with them by penetrating the trunk, but put them to strange new uses.\u201dGilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans. Brian Massumi (University of Minnesota Press, 1987). It is these \u201cstrange new uses\u201d that infiltrate an art derived from her bifurcated existence between Puerto Rico and the United States. She takes the language of cartography \u2013 part of her familial as well as artistic environment \u2013 and links it to digital communication and code-switching (the splicing of Spanish and English), working it through intersections that are both systematic and random: replete with directed thought and disconnected noise. \u201cCollazo-Llorens builds a text of alienation \u2013 of being alien,\u201d writes art critic and theorist Kathleen MacQueen, \u201cas an existential process of identifying what it means to be human.\u201dKathleen MacQueen, \"Subtle Intensities of the Unexpected,\" By Chance, A Video Show. 80WSE Galleries, 25 Jan. 2011."]}]}}
