The next season, Christopherson was selected by the Rugby Football Union to represent England in the opening game of the 1891 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Frederic Alderson, England's first match of the tournament was away to Wales. Christopherson had an excellent game, scoring two tries in the first half. The first was set up by half back William Leake which Christopherson scored after eluding Billy Bancroft. The second was a solo effort, scored after a fast, dodging run. Despite a promising start, Christopherson was not part of the team that travelled to Ireland a month later; being replaced by fellow Barbarian Piercy Morrison. Christopherson's final match for England was the tournament decider against Scotland. The match ended in victory for the Scots, and Christopherson never represented his country again."]}]}}
