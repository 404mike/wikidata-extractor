Wilkie served as an early member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1857 to 1861, representing the districts of West Bourke and Polwarth & South Grenville. In 1871, he was declared a lunatic, and restrained at the mental asylum in Cremorne before being returned to England, where he died in 1875.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allans Music", "response": ["Allans was established in May, 1850 when Joseph Wilkie and John Campbell Webster started a music warehouse (Wilkie and Webster) in Collins Street, Melbourne. George Leavis Allan joined the company in 1862, then twelve years after becoming a junior partner Allan found himself sole proprietor. (The original store had signage \"Wilkie, Webster & Allan\".) His son George became a partner in 1881 when the name of the firm was formally altered to Allan & Co. By 1877 it was the largest musical warehouse south of the equator, a distinction it retained; in spite of many changes in musical retailing, the firm of Allan built its name into the record of Australian music. The company subsequently became Allans Music Australia Ltd."]}, {"page": "Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1856\u20131859", "response": [": McDougall resigned in August 1857, replaced by Joseph Wilkie in an August 1857 by-election"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of West Bourke", "response": ["| Joseph Wilkie"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Polwarth and South Grenville", "response": ["| Joseph Wilkie"]}, {"page": "Wilkie, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Wilkie"]}]}}
