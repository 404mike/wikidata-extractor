He did not play quite so often the following year, but nevertheless managed three five-wicket hauls in first-class innings. In 1977 he enjoyed a successful time in three-day cricket especially: his 73 first-class wickets were his highest season's aggregate,\nand included 11 wickets against Middlesex in August.Wisden was impressed, saying that he had \"more than confirmed the promise of the previous season\" and had continued \"to mature in the Cartwright mould\".Perryman had another fairly successful summer in 1978, claiming exactly 50 first-class wickets. In the middle of June he took 12 wickets in the match against Lancashire,\nand a little over two months later he recorded his career best when he took a match-winning second-innings 7/49 against Hampshire.\nEarlier in the season he had also recorded his List A best, albeit against lesser opposition in the form of Minor Counties West in the Benson & Hedges Cup.\nHe took 51 first-class wickets in 1979, also claiming 26 List A victims (his most), but in 1980 he did not become a first-team regular until near the end of the season.\nIn the 1981 season Perryman averaged 43 in first-class cricket and 38 in the one-day game, his wicket totals roughly halving from 1980 in both forms of the game. At the end of the year he left Edgbaston and joined Worcestershire, where he played for two seasons. He did have some successes at his new county, such as the 6/49 he managed against Lancashire in August 1982,\nbut he could never quite establish himself as a true regular in the side, and in 1983 he was almost absent from one-day cricket, bowling just 13 overs.He played his final Worcestershire game, against Essex, in late August, rounding off his Warwickshire career with the single wicket of former West Indies Test player Norbert Phillip.\nAfter that, Perryman was seen no more at first-class level, though he did appear several times for Staffordshire in 1988, playing one List A match for the minor county when he turned out against Surrey in the NatWest Trophy in June.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Stephen Perryman \u2013 Warwickshire Cricketer"]}, {"page": "Andrew Webster (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1982 Webster began the year in the seconds, but made his way into the first team by mid-season, and once there retained his place for most of the rest of the summer. His best performance came against Hampshire in August, when he took his career-best of 5/87 in the first innings, then (batting at ten) stayed with number 11 Stephen Perryman as the two added 6 to complete a one-wicket victory."]}, {"page": "Perryman", "response": ["*Stephen Perryman (born 1955), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Stephen Perryman (1974\u20131981) : S.

While studying at the University of Cambridge, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Cambridge University against Warwickshire at Fenner's in 1976. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed in the Cambridge first-innings for 2 runs by Stephen Perryman, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by Peter Lewington for 29 runs. In addition to playing first-class cricket, Williams also played minor counties cricket for Shropshire in 1981 and 1982, making three appearances in the Minor Counties Championship, before returning to make a single appearance for Shropshire in the 1986 MCCA Knockout Trophy. After graduating from Cambridge, he became a schoolteacher."]}]}}
