His solitary league goal for The Quakers came in a 7\u20131 defeat at Scunthorpe United although he did also score in an FA Cup tie for Darlington at Altrincham.\nChillingworth broke into the Cambridge team on a more permanent basis during 2001\u201302 and scored twice before niggling injuries began to affect his form. He failed to score at all during the following season although he did manage to score a number of goals over the next two seasons to reach a career total of 13 goals for the club in 87 appearances. Sandwiched in between was a loan spell with Leyton Orient where he scored twice in eight games.\nFollowing Cambridge United's relegation from the Football League in 2005, Chillingworth accepted a 2-year contract with Rushden & Diamonds. At the end of his first season Rushden were also relegated from the Football League into the Nationwide Conferencec. At the time of the club's relegation, due to injury and loss of form, Chillingworth had joined Notts County on loan although hopes of a permanent deal were dashed when the Diamonds new manager wanted him back for the club's inaugural season in the Conference.\nA change of manager at Rushden left Chillingworth out of favour and he jumped at the chance of a return to Cambridge United on a free transfer in January 2007. Towards the end of the season he forged a useful partnership with Robbie Simpson, to help the club avoid relegation from the Conference. He also scored his first hat-trick for the club, in the 7\u20130 win over Weymouth in March 2007.\nIn the Summer of 2007, he signed a new contract with the U's - but only after boss Jimmy Quinn had withdrawn his original offer because he thought Chillingworth was taking too long to sign.\nHe is currently out with an ankle injury, and has yet to feature for United in the 2007\u201308 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cambridge United F.C.", "response": ["Cambridge United's Centre of Excellence is widely regarded throughout professional football circles as one of the best in England.http://www.cambridge-united.co.uk/page/COENews/0,,10423~1082778,00.html  Many players have come through the youth team to establish themselves as first team players at Cambridge (for example Dan Gleeson, Daniel Chillingworth, Robbie Willmott and Josh Coulson) and go on to play at a higher level (recent examples include John Ruddy, Michael Morrison and Josh Simpson).
