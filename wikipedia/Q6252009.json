After Pasco suggested some changes, and Nelson agreeing to them, the signal was sent at around 11:45 am on October 21, 1805, and relayed using a numeric flag code known as the \"Telegraphic Signals of Marine Vocabulary\".", "As the British fleet closed with the opposing combined fleets of France and Spain, Lord Nelson signalled all the necessary battle instructions to his ships. Aware of the momentousness of events to come, Lord Nelson felt that something extra was required. He instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant John Pasco, to signal to the fleet, as quickly as possible, the message \"England confides [i.e. is confident] that every man will do his duty.\" Pasco suggested to Nelson that expects be substituted for confides, since the former word was in the signal book, whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter. Nelson agreed to the change (even though it produced a less trusting impression):; reprinted and abridged from ", "Almost immediately, the signal began to be misquoted. A number of ships in the fleet recorded the signal as \"England expects every man to do his duty\" (omitting that and replacing will with to). This version became so prevalent that it is recorded on Nelson's tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral. The word that is also omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column, as seen in the photo above. However, the Victorys log and the accounts of signal officer John Pasco and Henry Blackwood (captain of the frigate Euryalus), both present at the preparation of the signal, agree on the form given here. On 26 December 1805, The Times newspaper in London reported the signal as; \"England expects every officer and man to do his duty this day\".Shapiro, Fred R (ed.) 2006, The Yale Book of Quotations, Yale University Press,  (p. 548) In 1811, the tenor John Braham composed a song, \"The Death of Nelson\", including the words of the signal. The song became popular almost immediately and was performed throughout the British Empire during the 19th century. To make the words fit the metre, they were altered to \"England expects that every man this day will do his duty\".
