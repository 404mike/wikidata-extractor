As a youth, he attended Keighley Boys Grammar School, in West Yorkshire. Smith subsequently attended Bradford Technical College, graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1907.\n\nSmith started his career with the Yorkshire machine-tool manufacturers Dean, Smith & Grace, then became a draughtsman with Northampton lift manufacturers Smith, Major and Stephens. In March 1914, Smith joined the Sopwith Aviation Company as a draughtsman. Later that year, he became Sopwith's chief engineer. Smith went on to design the Pup, Triplane, Camel, and Snipe. He worked for the Sopwith firm until it dissolved in October 1920.\nIn February 1921 the Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Company in Nagoya invited Smith, along with several other former Sopwith engineers to assist Mitsubishi in creating an aircraft manufacturing division. After moving to Japan, they designed the 1MT, B1M, 1MF, and 2MR.  Smith returned to England in 1924 and retired from the aviation industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mitsubishi", "response": ["In February 1921, the Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Company in Nagoya invited British Sopwith Camel designer Herbert Smith, along with several other former Sopwith engineers to assist in creating an aircraft manufacturing division.

It was recognised that the new fighter needed to be faster and have a heavier armament.

This aircraft, better known as the 1\u00bd Strutter due to its unconventional cabane strut arrangement, was used from 1916 by the RNAS, RFC and the French Aviation Militaire as a single-seat bomber, two-seat fighter and artillery spotter and trainer. Soon after came the small and agile single-seat Scout, which quickly became better known as the Pup because of its obvious descent from the 1\u00bd Strutter.\"Sopwith Pup \" Royal Air Force Museum. Retrieved: 18 August 2008. The Pup and 1\u00bd Strutter were the first successful British tractor fighters equipped with a synchronisation gear to allow a machine gun to fire through the rotating propeller. This gear was known as the Sopwith-Kauper gear from its designers, although several other designs were used later. The Pup was widely used on the Western Front by the RFC and from ships by the RNAS from the autumn of 1916 to the early summer of 1917, and was considered a delight to fly by its pilots. It continued in use as an advanced trainer for the remainder of the War. The Pup began the famous series of animal-named Sopwith aircraft during the war, which, as a whole, would become renowned in aviation history as \"The Flying Zoo\"."]}, {"page": "Sopwith Snipe", "response": ["In April 1917, Herbert Smith, the chief designer of the Sopwith Company, began to design a fighter intended to be the replacement for Sopwith's most famous aeroplane, the successful Sopwith Camel.Lumsden Aeroplane Monthly October 1990, p. 588. The resultant design, called Snipe by Sopwith, was in its initial form a single-bay biplane, slightly smaller than the Camel, and intended to be powered by similar engines. The pilot sat higher than in the Camel while the centre-section of the upper wing was uncovered, giving a better view from the cockpit. Armament was to be two Vickers machine guns.Bruce Air International April 1974, pp. 190\u2013191.Davis 1999, p. 136. In the absence of an official order, Sopwith began construction of two prototypes as a private venture in September 1917. This took advantage of a licence that had been granted to allow construction of four Sopwith Rhino bomber prototypes, only two of which were built. The first prototype Snipe, powered by a Bentley AR.1 rotary engine was completed in October 1917. The second prototype was completed with the new, more powerful Bentley BR.2, engine, which gave  in November 1917. This promised better performance, and prompted an official contract for six prototypes to be placed, including the two aircraft built as private ventures.Bruce Air International April 1974, pp. 191\u2013192."]}, {"page": "Sopwith Triplane", "response": ["The Triplane was developed by the firm's experimental department as a private venture, the project was headed by the designer Herbert Smith. Aside from its obvious difference in wing configuration, the aircraft shared many similarities with the company's successful biplane fighter, the Sopwith Pup. The prototype Triplane performed its maiden flight on 28 May 1916 and was dispatched to the French theatre two months later, where it garnered high praise for its exceptional rate of climb and high manoeuvrability. During late 1916, quantity production of the type commenced in response to orders received from the Admiralty. During early 1917, production examples of the Triplane arrived with Royal Naval Air Service squadrons.", "During the First World War, the Sopwith Aviation Company became a prominent British manufacturer of military aircraft. It was amid this conflict that one of its employees, Herbert Smith, designed the Sopwith Pup, a single-seat biplane fighter aircraft which was described by aviation author J.M. Bruce as being \"one of the world's greatest aeroplanes\". While it was a capable fighter that possessed impressive handling qualities for its era, from an aerodynamic perspective, the Pup was an entirely conventional design. Certain figures, including those within Sopwith's experimental department, sought to develop a successor which would instead pioneer new concepts for such an aircraft; out of such ambitions would emerge the Triplane.Bruce 1965, p. 3."]}, {"page": "Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter", "response": ["The Sigrist Bus formed the basis for a new, larger, fighter aircraft, the Sopwith LCT (Land Clerget Tractor), designed by Herbert Smith and powered by a  Clerget engine. Like the Sigrist Bus, each of the upper wings (there was no true centre section) was connected to the fuselage by a pair of short (half) struts and a pair of longer struts, forming a \"W\" when viewed from the front; this giving rise to the aircraft's popular nickname of the  Strutter.

The resulting Dolphin was a two-bay, single-seat biplane, with the upper wings attached to an open steel cabane frame above the cockpit. To maintain the correct centre of gravity, the lower wings were positioned  forward of the upper wings, creating the Dolphin's distinctive negative wing stagger.Cooksley 1991, p. 34. The pilot sat with his head through the frame, where he had an excellent view. This configuration sometimes caused difficulty for novices, who found it difficult to keep the aircraft pointed at the horizon because the nose was not visible from the cockpit. The cockpit was nevertheless warm and comfortable, in part because water pipes ran alongside the cockpit walls to the two side-mounted radiator blocks. A pair of single-panel shutters, one in front of each radiator core and operated by the pilot, allowed the engine temperature to be controlled."]}, {"page": "Herbert Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["Herbert Smith is a law firm based in London.", "Herbert Smith may also refer to:", "*Herbert Smith (trade unionist) (1862\u20131938), British miners' union leader; subject of The Man in the Cap by Jack Lawson", "*Herbert Smith (politician) (1871\u20131935), Australian politician", "*Sir Herbert Smith, 1st Baronet (1872\u20131943), English carpet manufacturer", "*Herbert Smith (mineralogist) (1872\u20131953), British mineralogist", "*Herbert Smith (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u20131951), English international footballer, gold medallist in the 1908 Olympics", "*Herbert Smith (half-back), English footballer for Port Vale", "*Herbert Smith (forward), English footballer for Bradford City", "*Herbert Smith (aircraft designer) (1889\u20131977), British aircraft designer", "*Herbert Smith (producer) (1901\u20131986), British film producer and director", "*Herbert Smith (rugby league), English rugby league footballer of the 1920s for Great Britain, England, Bradford Northern, and Halifax", "*Herbert Smith (rugby league, born 1915) (1915\u2013?), English rugby league footballer of the 1930s and 1940s for Batley Shamrocks, Castleford, Bramley, Batley, and Bradford Northern", "*Herbert Smith (baseball), Negro league baseball player", "*Herbert Smith, regular on the BBC Radio comedy The Clitheroe Kid", "*Herbert Smith (art director) (1916\u20132006), production designer for the 1965 movie The Hill", "*Herbert Smith (businessman), British businessman in Hong Kong", "*G.
