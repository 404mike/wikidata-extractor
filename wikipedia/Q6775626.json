Stannard explained that the two of them worked in an \"organic manner\", placing a microphone in the middle of a room, then playing the chords and laying down tracks on top of them, finally singing the first ideas that came up. The melody was composed by singing over the chords, before Stannard wrote some of the lyrics on his hand from watching a film the night before. Because of his professional and personal relationship with Bunton from their previous work during the Spice Girls' sessions, the creative process was fairly simple, he commented: \"With that backing track we just got writing straight away and before you knew it the words were done.\" Bunton finished writing the song with Stannard and songwriter/producer Julian Gallagher, and she commented about the process: \"I'm very hands on with lyrics and production, I have to know what's going on.
