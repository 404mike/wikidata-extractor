The Manchester Guardian wrote, \"a brilliant performance\u00a0... a distinguished contribution to intellectual fiction.\"\"Books of the Day\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 October 1929, p. 7  In 1930 he wrote  D. H. Lawrence: A First Study, the first book-length work on Lawrence, which appeared in print within a few days of the death of its subject, unfortunate timing because it seemed like an inadequate memorial rather than what it was intended to be, a critical reappraisal. It also suffered from a regrettable misprint, rendering the heading \"Sea and Sardinia\", as \"Sex and Sardinia\". This was soon amplified by rumour into \"Sex and Sardines\", none of which helped Potter's reputation as a serious writer. Potter's most comprehensive critic was the friend from whom he had inherited the Cape commission, G.B. Edwards, in Middleton Murry's Adelphi.Edward Chaney, Genius Friend: G.B. Edwards and The Book of Ebenezer le Page, Blue Ormer 2015  After this he concentrated in his next four works on Coleridge.

In 1935 he published his most important contribution to the subject, Coleridge and S.T.C., a discussion of the duality in the poet's nature, \"not merely the earlier and the later, but the true and the false, and the exciting and the nauseating,\" as John Middleton Murry put it in a review in The Times Literary Supplement. Reviews were good, but with reservations that Potter oversimplified the dichotomy in Coleridge's nature (The Observer) or else did not explore the underlying reasons for it (TLS).de S\u00e9lincourt, Basil, \"Two Beings in One\", The Observer, 28 April 1935, p. 5"]}, {"page": "Mary Elizabeth Coleridge", "response": ["Mary Coleridge was the daughter of Arthur Duke Coleridge, the lawyer and influential amateur musician.
