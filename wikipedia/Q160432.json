She first appeared in All the King's Men, a political thriller set in 1940s Louisiana, featuring Sean Penn and Jude Law. She played the supporting part of the love interest to Law's character. The film received negative reviews for its lack of political insight and narrative cohesiveness, and failed to recoup its $55\u00a0million investment. Her next release, the drama Little Children, was better received. Based on the novel of the same name, the film tells the story of Sarah Pierce, an unhappy housewife who has an affair with a married neighbour (played by Patrick Wilson). Winslet was challenged by the role of an uncaring mother, as she did neither understand nor respect her character's actions. Scenes requiring her to be hostile towards the child actress who played her daughter proved upsetting for her. Having given birth to two children, she was nervous about the sex scenes in which she had to be nude; she took on the challenge to present a positive image for women with, in her words, \"imperfect bodies\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that Winslet had successfully \"register[ed] every flicker of Sarah's pride, self-doubt and desire, inspiring a mixture of recognition, pity and concern\". With another Academy Award for Best Actress nomination, she, at 31, became the youngest performer to accrue five Oscar nominations.", "Leonardo DiCaprio, her co-star in Titanic and Revolutionary Road, considers Winslet to be \"the most prepared and well-researched actor on set\", and Jude Law, her co-star in The Holiday, believes that despite her seriousness she remains \"very calm and good-natured\". Her Steve Jobs director Danny Boyle has identified a willingness in Winslet to avoid typecasting and said that she takes an effort \"to reposition directors' and producers' perspective on her\" to allow herself to be challenged as an artist."]}, {"page": "Juliette Binoche", "response": ["Next, Binoche traveled to the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere of Breaking and Entering, her second film with Anthony Minghella in the director's chair, based on his first original screenplay since his breakthrough film Truly, Madly, Deeply (1991). In Breaking and Entering, Binoche played a Bosnian refugee living in London, while Jude Law co-starred as a well-to-do businessman drawn into her life via an act of deception. In preparation for her role, Binoche traveled to Sarajevo where she met women who had survived the war of the 1990s. Lushly photographed by Beno\u00eet Delhomme, Breaking and Entering portrays intersecting lives amongst the flux of urban renewal in inner-city London. Despite the fact that Binoche was praised for her performance, the film did not ring true for critics and failed to find an audience.Breaking and Entering Movie Reviews, Pictures. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 7 January 2011. In a review in Variety, Todd McCarthy writes that, \"Binoche, physically unchanged as ever, plays Amira's controlled anguish with skill\". Breaking and Entering also featured Robin Wright, Vera Farmiga, Juliet Stevenson, Rafi Gavron and Martin Freeman."]}]}}
