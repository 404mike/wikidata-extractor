In turn, he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper, \"The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History\", which was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology in 1895. Becoming Petrie's de facto though unofficial assistant, Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffith's absence. In 1898 she was appointed to the position of Junior Lecturer, responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department; this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom. In this capacity, she spent two days a week at UCL, devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother. As time went on, she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history, religion, and language. Among Murray's students\u00a0\u2013 to whom she referred as \"the Gang\"\u00a0\u2013 were several who went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology, including Reginald Engelbach, Georgina Aitken, Guy Brunton, and Myrtle Broome.

In archaeology Harageh is mainly known for a series of cemeteries dating to several periods of Egyptian history. Reginald Engelbach excavated these cemeteries in 1913. The cemeteries belong to the Naqada-Period, to the First Intermediate Period, to the late Middle Kingdom and to the New Kingdom; a few Coptic stelae were discovered here as well. Especially the burials of the late Middle Kingdom belonged to wealthy people. Perhaps the people of El-Lahun were buried here. Engelbach found stelae including the only one known to be dedicated to the god Hedjhotep, inscribed coffins, canopic boxes and jars, and many statues."]}]}}
