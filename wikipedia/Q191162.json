Playing as a striker, he made more than 500 appearances in the Football League and Premier League over an 18-year career, and represented England in international football. He also had a spell in Australia, playing for the A-League club Newcastle Jets.\nBorn in Leicester, Heskey started his career with Leicester City after progressing through their youth system, making his first-team debut in 1995. After winning the League Cup in 1997 and 2000 he made an \u00a311 million move to Liverpool in 2000, which, at the time, was the record transfer fee paid by the club. At Liverpool, he won multiple honours, including the FA Cup in 2001. He moved to Birmingham City in 2004 and after their relegation from the Premier League signed for Wigan Athletic for a club record \u00a35.5 million fee in 2006. He signed for Aston Villa in 2009 and was released in 2012 before signing for A-League club Newcastle Jets. After two years, he returned to England, finishing his career with Championship club Bolton Wanderers.\nHeskey was an England international at under-16, under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut against Hungary in a 1\u20131 draw in 1999. He lost his place in the squad after UEFA Euro 2004, during which he failed to shine and was the subject of much criticism. After a long lay-off from international duty, Heskey was recalled to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers in September 2007. He retired from international football following the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having attained 62 caps and scored 7 goals for his country.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Premier League", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left\"| Emile Heskey", "* 500 Club: Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Gareth Barry, Ryan Giggs, David James, Gary Speed, Frank Lampard, Emile Heskey and Sol Campbell"]}, {"page": "January 11", "response": ["*  1978   \u2013 Emile Heskey, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1978", "response": ["* January 11 \u2013 Emile Heskey, English footballer"]}, {"page": "EFL Cup", "response": ["**Emile Heskey for Leicester City (1997, 1999, 2000), Liverpool (2001, 2003) and Aston Villa (2010)"]}, {"page": "Rio Ferdinand", "response": ["In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live he criticised FIFA's approach to tackling racism in football, stating that not enough was being done to punish those guilty of homophobic or racist abuse at matches.

In July 2005, chairman David Gold said it was time to \"start talking about being as good as anyone outside the top three or four\" with \"the best squad of players for 25 years\". Injuries, loss of form, and lack of transfer window investment saw them relegated in a season whose lowlight was a 7\u20130 FA Cup defeat to Liverpool.

Kewell completed his first ever season at Anfield equal second with Emile Heskey by scoring seven goals, nine behind Michael Owen as Liverpool's top goalscorer for the 2003\u201304 Premier League season. Kewell also finished as Liverpool's top scorer in the 2003\u201304 UEFA Cup, scoring goals against Olimpija Ljubljana, Steaua Bucure\u0219ti and Levski Sofia which ended Kewell's season total of ten goals. Kewell kicked off his 2004\u201305 season poorly, failing to score in his first 14 matches, due to injury problems. He did finally score his first goal in round 15 of the Premier League in a 1\u20131 away draw against Aston Villa, and that was his only Premier League goal of the season, making this one of his worst seasons ever.

The efforts yielded a result in the successful 2000\u201301 season, when Liverpool won a cup treble of the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup and finished third in the Premier League, hence qualifying for Champions League. In August 2001, Liverpool won the Charity Shield against Manchester United and UEFA Super Cup against Bayern Munich.", "Houllier's first match in charge was the League Cup match against Blackburn Rovers on 22 September. Villa won the match 3\u20131, coming back from a goal down to progress to the next round of the competition. It was announced on 18 September 2010 that Gary McAllister had agreed to become his assistant manager, with Gordon Cowans also taking a role in Houllier's backroom staff. Two days after the Blackburn match, he signed a three-year contract. However, Houllier's start at the club proved to be difficult. The side was hit with injuries to key players Gabriel Agbonlahor, Stiliyan Petrov, Nigel Reo-Coker and Emile Heskey, and managed just one win in ten Premier League matches. In November 2010, Houllier signed 37-year-old former Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires on a free transfer in an attempt to aid the club during its injury crisis. By January 2011, Villa had picked up just 21 points from 20 Premier League matches. The club had also been knocked out of the League Cup the previous month by local rivals Birmingham City. On 5 January, Villa were beaten 1\u20130 at home by Sunderland; this loss left Villa in 18th position in the league table, the first time they had been in the relegation zone since 2003. During the match, a selection of the home crowd targeted Houllier with chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" to vent their frustration at the club's poor run of form. Despite this, Villa directors acted quickly to insist that Houllier's job as manager was safe."]}, {"page": "Robbie Fowler", "response": ["The 2000\u201301 season was Fowler's most successful season.

However he found himself the third-choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey.", "Despite his popularity with Liverpool fans, who referred to Fowler as \"God\", Michael Owen and Emile Heskey had established themselves as Liverpool's regular strike partnership, leaving Fowler on the fringes of the first team. This, along with his difficult relationship with Houllier, made him seek regular first team football away from Anfield in the form of a \u00a312 million move to Leeds United.

The 2007\u201308 season began well for Wigan, with Emile Heskey recalled to the England squad, as the first Wigan player to represent England whilst a full member of the club. However, he broke his foot immediately after his England call-up and was out injured for six weeks. The club's league position subsequently worsened, and on the back of a run of six consecutive defeats, Wigan fell into the relegation zone. Whelan took the decision to sack Hutchings on 5 November 2007, after 12 games in charge, reinstating Bruce, who saved the club from relegation.", "In the summer of 2008, Bruce signed Lee Cattermole from Middlesbrough for \u00a33.5\u00a0million, and Egyptian striker Amr Zaki sign on an initial one-year loan.
