The final two goals were scored in the last ten minutes. A shot from Wally Masterman rebounded from the bar but Fazackerly headed it past the Chelsea keeper for United's second.  Directly after this goal Joe Kitchen picked the ball up just inside the Chelsea half and passed two defenders.

This brought him to the attention of Sheffield United who paid \u00a31,000 for his services, then a record fee for the club.
