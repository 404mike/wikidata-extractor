A. Parsons and Company.  He worked as an engineer on dynamo and turbine design, and power generation, with great influence on the naval and electrical engineering fields. He also developed optical equipment for searchlights and telescopes.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cavitation", "response": ["The term cavitation first appeared in 1895 in a paper by John Isaac Thornycroft (1843\u20131928) and Sydney Walker Barnaby (1855\u20131925) \u2014 son of Sir Nathaniel Barnaby (1829 \u2013 1915), who had been Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy \u2014 to whom it had been suggested by the British engineer Robert Edmund Froude (1846\u20131924), third son of the English hydrodynamicist William Froude (1810\u20131879).

The stroboscope is described on p. 234:  \"The screw [i.e., propeller] was illuminated by light from an arc lamp reflected from a revolving mirror attached to the screw shaft, which fell on it at one point only of the revolution, and by this means the shape, form, and growth of the cavities could be clearly seen and traced as if stationary.\"See: "]}, {"page": "Electricity", "response": ["While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.

He patented the first steam turbine on Tyneside in 1884. Parsons, born in Ireland in 1854, was the youngest son of the Earl of Rosse and a keen inventor, who was a junior partner in the Tyneside engineering firm of Clarke Chapman. In 1894 Parsons' Marine Turbine Company launched , the first ship to be powered by electric turbines. She can be still be seen (and boarded) at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne.", "Charles Algernon Parsons invented the steam turbine in 1884, and having foreseen its potential to power ships he set up the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company with five associates in 1893. To develop this he had the experimental vessel  built in a light design of steel by the firm of Brown and Hood, based at Wallsend on Tyne. He also pioneered in the field of electricity generation, establishing the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company in 1889.

Used early on in electrical generation and to power ships, turbines were bladed wheels that created rotary motion when high pressure steam was passed through them. The efficiency of large steam turbines was considerably better than the best compound engines, while also being much simpler, more reliable, smaller and lighter all at the same time. Steam turbines would eventually replace piston engines for most power generation.copied from the Wikipedia article Timeline of steam power, see that article for references"]}]}}
