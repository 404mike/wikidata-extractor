In the mid-1980s, he became head of light entertainment at LWT. Live From Her Majesty's, Copy Cats and The Stanley Baxter Show number amongst his successes. He died of AIDS, aged 52.\nIn 1978 Bell was involved with Michael Grade's move bringing Bruce Forsyth to ITV to present a Saturday night spectacular. On the back of his mammoth success with The Generation Game, Forsyth was never settled with ITV's two-hour multi-format evening of glitz, mini-soaps, game shows and gags. None of which was for want of trying by David Bell, whose biting wit and flair meant he enjoyed the respect of all in his production team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Bell", "response": ["David Bell may refer to:", "* David Bell (university administrator) (born 1959), Scottish academic administrator and civil servant", "* David Bell (philosopher) (born 1947), British philosopher", "* David Bell (artist) (1915\u20131959), British curator and writer", "* David Bell (historian) (born 1961), American historian of France", "* David Bell (author) (born 1969), American author and professor", "* David Bell (golfer) (born 1880), Scottish golfer", "* David Bell (field hockey) (born 1955), Australian field hockey player and coach", "* David Bell (baseball) (born 1972), Former American baseball player and current manager of the Cincinnati Reds", "* David Bell (basketball) (born 1981), American basketball player", "* David Bell (sportsman) (born 1949), Scottish rugby union and cricket representative", "* David Bell (footballer, born 1985), Irish footballer", "* David Bell (footballer, born 1984), Irish footballer", "* David Bell (Australian footballer) (1890\u20131961), Australian rules footballer", "* David Bell (American football) (born 2000), American football wide receiver", "* David Bell (Australian politician) (1828\u20131894), New South Wales politician", "* David Bell (Irish Republican) (1818\u20131890)", "* David Bell (television executive) (1937\u20131990), Scottish television producer and director", "* David Bell (VC) (1845\u20131920), Irish soldier", "* David Bell (composer) (born 1954), American composer", "* David Bell (publisher) (born 1946), American publisher", "* David Belle (born 1973), French actor, film choreographer, and stunt coordinator"]}, {"page": "David Bell (Television)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Bell (television executive)"]}, {"page": "David Bell (television)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Bell (television executive)"]}]}}
