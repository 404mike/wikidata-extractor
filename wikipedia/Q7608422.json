She is best known for the lead role of Inspector Jean Darblay in the first three series of the 1980s television BBC police drama Juliet Bravo (1980\u201382).\nAn early screen appearance was in Morning Story (1970), and she also played Dennis Waterman's screen wife, Alison Carter, in early episodes of The Sweeney (1975), and WPC Howarth in Z-Cars (1972\u201375), which stood her in good stead for her role as Inspector Darblay.\nShe appeared in a 1975 episode of Public Eye as Julia Sissons, a 'missing' common-law wife-turned-barmaid. She also made an appearance in Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads and played a recurring role as Jessie Naylor, n\u00e9e Maugham, in Series 2 of Sam (1974). In the 1990s, she was in each episode of The Hello Girls as Miss Armitage, a supervisor of a 1950s GPO switchboard; and played Mrs Hope Q.C. in two episodes of At Home with the Braithwaites.Having worked in various roles between the 1960s and 2000s on stage, on radio, on television and as a director, Turner retired from acting in 2010.
