Barham quickly capsized to port and was lying on her side when a massive magazine explosion occurred about four minutes after she was torpedoed and sank her. The Board of Enquiry into the sinking ascribed the final explosion to a fire in the 4-inch magazines outboard of the main 15-inch magazines, which would have then spread to and detonated the contents of the main magazines.Jones, pp. 258\u2013259 Due to the speed at which she sank, 862 officers and ratings were killed,Rohwer, p. 118 including two who died of their wounds after being rescued. The destroyer  rescued some 337 survivors, including Vice-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell and the pair who later died of their wounds, while the Australian destroyer  reportedly rescued some 150 men.Jones, pp. 242\u2013243 Captain Geoffrey Cooke went down with his ship.

Although Italian intentions were unclear, Cunningham's staff believed an attack upon British troop convoys was likely and orders were issued to spoil the enemy plan and, if possible, intercept their fleet. Cunningham wished, however, to disguise his own activity and arranged for a game of golf and a fictitious evening gathering to mislead enemy agents (he was, in fact, overheard by the local Japanese Consul)."]}, {"page": "Battle of Calabria", "response": ["Force C \u2013 Commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell."]}, {"page": "HMS Wryneck (D21)", "response": ["After 1900 hrs on 27 April the Vice Admiral, Light Forces, Henry Pridham-Wippell, became concerned that Diamond had not returned to Souda Bay and was not answering radio signals.

British signals intelligence had revealed the Italian plan and Cunningham attempted to consolidate his ships, but was delayed and missed his rendezvous with the 7th CS scheduled for the following morning. The Italians located the squadron first and the 3rd Cruiser Division with three heavy cruisers, escorted by three destroyers, opened fire at 08:12 at very long range. Only Gloucester returned fire as the British attempted to disengage, but the Italians followed, against orders, when Admiral Angelo Iachino recalled them at 08:55. The 7th CS turned around to observe the Italian manoeuvre and Iachino attempted to pincer the British cruisers between his 3rd Cruiser Division and his flagship, the battleship . Although Vice-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell knew that the Italians had a battleship at sea, he was still caught by surprise when Vittorio Veneto opened fire at 10:55 at Orion. The 3rd Cruiser Division joined in shortly afterwards, but gunnery problems plagued the Italians and they scored no hits against their primary targets, Gloucester and Orion. The British ships laid smoke screens and turned south towards the main body of the Mediterranean Fleet. An unsuccessful attack by torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier  persuaded Iachino to turn back at 11:40. The 7th CS was able to keep up the pursuit that afternoon after another torpedo bomber attack damaged the Vittorio Veneto at 15:20 and reduced her speed. A subsequent attack crippled the heavy cruiser  and Orions radar picked up Pola, and the two other heavy cruisers that had been sent to her assistance, at 20:15. Cunningham's three battleships quickly sank all three heavy cruisers at point-blank range later that night.Greene & Massagnani, pp. 148\u201356"]}, {"page": "1st Battle Squadron", "response": ["* Rear-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell (July\u2013October 1940)", "* Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell (1941\u201342)"]}, {"page": "Battle of the Espero Convoy", "response": ["The 1st Battle Squadron (Rear-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell) with  , the aircraft carrier  and the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, were to be south-west of Crete also near Position K, ready to intervene according to circumstances.

In the ensuing battle, while the escort leader in the auxiliary cruiser RAMB III withdrew after firing a few shots, Barbini counterattacked twice with guns and torpedoes (that could not be fired due to the damage suffered), in an attempt to draw enemy fire on his ship and distract the British force from the merchant ships. Fabrizi was heavily damaged, and was ultimately unable to prevent the convoy's destruction; on fire and slowly sinking, the torpedo boat limped into Vlor\u00eb (). Barbini had been seriously wounded at the beginning of the battle, but despite serious blood loss from a wounded leg, he refused medical aid until the fighting was over, and maintained command of his ship until it was safely moored in harbour.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare.

The Polish commissioner to Danzig, Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e, informed the Senate that the Wicher would be entering the harbour regardless about its feelings about the matter. Pridham-Wippell was not certain if he should exchange visits with the Wicher since the Senate had refused permission for the Wicher to enter the harbour, but the British consul in Danzig advised him to go ahead. In addition, Count Manfredi di Gravina, the Italian diplomat who served as the League of Nations Commissioner for Danzig, advised Pridham-Wippell to exchange visits with Morgenstern-Podjazd. Gravina was unpopular with the Poles, who accused him of being biased toward Germany."]}]}}
