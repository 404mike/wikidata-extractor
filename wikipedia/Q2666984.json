Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Leaf volunteered for active service. Early in the war, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell improvised searchlights to deter night attacks during the Siege of Mafeking. Soon afterward a detachment of the Electrical Engineers Volunteers went to South Africa where they operated electric Arc lamp searchlights, the first use of such equipment by the Royal Engineers on campaign. Leaf was granted the temporary rank of Captain in the Army on 17 March 1900, and served with detachment, which was in South Africa from April to October 1900 in the Transvaal and Orange Free State.He later served in the First world war in France, and was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his services.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rackets at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles", "response": ["|align=center| 2  || Henry Leaf || "]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| , Henry Leaf || Rackets", "|bgcolor=silver| 2nd ||align=left| Henry Leaf || Bye || Bye || Defeated Brougham  3-0 || Lost to Noel  Walkover", "|bgcolor=cc9966| 3rd ||align=left| Henry Leaf  Evan Noel || Lost to Astor & Pennell  4-2 ||bgcolor=lightgray| Did not advance"]}, {"page": "Evan Noel", "response": ["He won the gold medal in the men's singles event.
