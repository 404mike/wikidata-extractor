He played as a right winger.\nBorn in Bolton, Lancashire, Barnes began his career as a junior with Blackpool, turning professional in May 1954. As the understudy to Stanley Matthews, his opportunities were understandably limited, and in June 1959, after only 9 league appearances he moved to Rochdale for a fee of \u00a31,000. He quickly became a regular in the Spotland side, playing in 91 league games in 2 seasons, and scoring 7 goals. In July 1961, he was sold to Wrexham for a fee of \u00a34,000, where he established himself as a goalscoring winger (24 goals in 88 league games).\nHe had two seasons with Wrexham, and helped them win promotion to the Third Division.In August 1963, he moved to Norwich City, where he was to play 21 league games, and score only 1 goal, before moving to Peterborough United in July 1964 for a fee of \u00a35,000. He played 39 league games (6 goals) for the Posh, before a move to Torquay United in January 1966, where he established himself as an unpredictable goalscoring winger.\nIn 1969, after 25 goals in 114 league games for Torquay, he left the English game, signing for Cape Town City. He subsequently settled in South Africa, working in the printing trade.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Ronald Barnes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ron Barnes (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Ronald Barnes", "response": ["Ronald or Ron Barnes may refer to:", "*Ron Barnes (footballer) (1936\u20131991), English footballer", "*Ron Barnes (umpire) (born 1958), American former baseball umpire"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=left|Ron Barnes"]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Ron Barnes"]}]}}
