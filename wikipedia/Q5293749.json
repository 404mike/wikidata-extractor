He impressed in his creative performances at Brisbane Road, enough so that Liverpool manager Don Welsh paid \u00a36,500 and part-exchanged Don Woan to bring the 18-year-old to the club in November 1951. He made his debut on 10 November 1951 at Anfield in a league match against Bolton Wanderers; Jackson's first goal for the club in the 61st minute was enough for the \"Reds\" to get a point from a 1\u20131 draw. He went on to tally up 15 First Division appearances in the 1951\u201352 season. However, he never really established himself in the Liverpool side, and featured only five times in the 1952\u201353 campaign. He scored four goals in 28 games in 1953\u201354, as Liverpool suffered relegation. He featured in 23 Second Division games in the 1954\u201355 campaign, before posting 15 appearances in 1955\u201356 and 19 appearances in 1956\u201357, as Liverpool twice finished in third place. He played 24 games in the 1957\u201358 campaign, as Phil Taylor's side finished two points short of promotion. His stay at Liverpool lasted for six and a half years and he managed 133 senior appearances, mostly in his preferred outside right position, never really establishing himself as a first-team regular."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Don Woan||||1952\u20131954||21||0||"]}, {"page": "1951\u201352 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Don Woan"]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Don Woan"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 in English football", "response": ["* 24 April 2020: Don Woan, 92, Liverpool, Leyton Orient, Bradford City and Tranmere Rovers striker."]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Don Woan, 92, English footballer (Liverpool, Leyton Orient, Bradford City, Tranmere Rovers)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*Don Woan, 92, English footballer (Liverpool).RIP Donald Woan"]}, {"page": "Woan", "response": ["* Don Woan (1927\u20132020), English football player"]}]}}
