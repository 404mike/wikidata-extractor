He was the Principal Librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales (now State Library of New South Wales) from 1912 until his retirement in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abel Tasman", "response": ["In 1943, a mosaic version of the map, composed of coloured marble and brass, was inlaid into the vestibule floor of the Mitchell Library in Sydney.Tasman Map in the Mitchell Vestibule, State Library of NSW The work was commissioned by the Principal\u00a0Librarian William Ifould, and completed by the Melocco Brothers of Annandale, who also worked on ANZAC War Memorial in Hyde Park and the crypt at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney."]}, {"page": "State Library of New South Wales", "response": ["Mitchell had not kept a catalogue of his collection, and as a result, cataloguing was an early priority for librarians in the Mitchell Library. A research department was established as part of the public library in the 1920s under the direction of Nita Kibble, while Ida Leeson as Head of Acquisitions researched gaps in the library's collections. Kibble's research department was later used as a model by other State Libraries when establishing similar services. Mitchell's bequest also included funding for collection acquisition; expanding the library's collection (particularly in the area of Australiana and Pacific material) was a priority for both Wright and William Ifould, who was appointed Principal Librarian in 1912. Ifould envisioned the library as a repository of material relating to the history of Australia, not just New South Wales, and led efforts to collect material. The library acquired the papers of Lachlan Macquarie and his family in 1914, Matthew Flinders in 1922, and Abel Tasman's journal in 1926, and after World War I collected journals of soldiers from that conflict. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Library (now the National Library of Australia), established in 1901, was also collecting Australiana material. This led to conflict over the acquisition of the papers of James Cook, which were offered at auction in London in 1923. The Trustees chose not to bid for the papers as doing so would have limited the library's Australiana acquisitions budget for several years and Ifould, already in London with hopes of purchasing the papers for the Mitchell Library, was directed instead to purchase them on behalf of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library and the Public Library of New South Wales using funds provided by the Federal Government."]}, {"page": "Ida Leeson", "response": ["Leeson began her working career briefly as a teacher, before taking up a position at the Public Library of New South Wales as a library assistant in 1906. She transferred to a position in the Mitchell Library in 1909, where she processed the collection of Australiana bequeathed to the library by David Scott Mitchell.  \"Leeson's interest in Australian and Pacific materials grew as she worked up the ranks at the Mitchell Library, eventually landing the senior position of principal accessions officer in 1919.\" In this role Leeson was amongst the most senior staff at the library ranking behind William Ifould, Wright and Nita Kibble. Ida Leeson was a significant influence on the history of the Mitchell Library and was the first woman to achieve a senior management position in an Australian library."]}, {"page": "List of Australian diarists of World War I", "response": ["William Ifould, Principal Librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales (later State Library of New South Wales), led a collecting drive which began within six months of the conclusion of the war.  Ifould arranged for advertisements in newspapers across Australia offering to buy relevant papers for the Library, and also reached out to soldiers through the Returned Soldiers' Association of New South Wales. Efforts focused on diaries documenting training and active service, with accounts recorded \"at the moment\" or as soon after as possible considered the most useful."]}, {"page": "John Metcalfe (librarian)", "response": ["In 1923 Metcalfe was appointed to the Public Library of New South Wales. William Ifould, the Principal Librarian, took an interest in Metcalfe's career and mentored him.
