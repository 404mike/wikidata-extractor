Sub Lieutenant Herbert Annesley Packer was subsequently promoted for his command of \"A\" turret. Rather than continue, Warspite was stopped for ten minutes so the crew could make repairs. They succeeded in correcting the problem, but the ship would be plagued with steering irregularities for the rest of her naval career. As the light faded the Grand Fleet crossed ahead of the German battle line and opened fire, forcing the High Seas Fleet to retreat and allowing Warspite to slip away.Ballantyne, 2013, pp.\u00a051\u201352."]}, {"page": "Cressage", "response": ["Among the village's well-known inhabitants was Admiral Sir Herbert Annesley Packer, who was born in the village on 9 October 1894."]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Herbert Annesley Packer, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Herbert Annesley Packer, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Herbert Annesley Packer, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Herbert Annesley Packer, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Herbert Annesley Packer, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Herbert Annesley Packer, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Herbert Annesley Packer, Fourth Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "1962 in South Africa", "response": ["* 23 September - Herbert Annesley Packer, Royal Navy Admiral and Commander-in-Chief of South Atlantic, dies in Cape Town (b. 1894) "]}, {"page": "Packer", "response": ["* Herbert Annesley Packer (1894\u20131962), British naval officer"]}, {"page": "Sir Herbert Annesley Packer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Annesley Packer"]}, {"page": "Bertie Packer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Annesley Packer"]}, {"page": "Herbert Packer", "response": ["* Herbert Annesley Packer (1894\u20131962), British Royal Navy admiral"]}, {"page": "Sir Herbert Packer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Annesley Packer"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (H)", "response": ["# Herbert Annesley Packer"]}, {"page": "List of people buried at sea", "response": ["* Admiral Sir Herbert Annesley Packer (1894\u20131962) (ashes scattered at sea off Cape Point, South Africa)"]}, {"page": "1950 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Vice-Admiral Herbert Annesley Packer, CB, CBE"]}]}}
