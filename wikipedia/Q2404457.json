In December of that year, the Channel 4 television comedy Star Stories broadcast a satirical mockumentary of Mills's life story from her point of view. In 2009, after petitioning the Press Complaints Commission in the UK about being lied about in the press, five British tabloids (The Sun, Daily Express, News of the World, Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror) publicly apologised to Mills about printing false, hurtful or defamatory stories about her. Another tabloid (Daily Mail), sent a private letter of apology. Mills has complained that over 4,400 abusive articles about her have been published.Blacker, Terence.

The extent and nature of the British press coverage of Mills has been criticised, as in May 2003, when The Guardian columnist Matt Seaton wrote a piece declaring: \"There is little that is edifying in the symbolic lynching of Heather. The poisonous judgmentalism that drives it, is in the worst tradition of small town gossip. It is prurient, spiteful, hypocritical, and we should cry 'shame' on it.\" Publicist Mark Borkowski wrote in The Independent on Sunday, on 23 March 2008: \"Not since the cult of Myra Hindley have we encountered so much vitriol aimed at one woman.\" Feminist writer Natasha Walter has compared the coverage to that of Britney Spears. Terence Blacker wrote that public figures who are young, female, pretty and fair-haired, are often subjected to public bullying, which is explained as \"intense media interest\", such as Diana, Princess of Wales, Paula Yates, Ulrika Jonsson and Mills."]}, {"page": "The Painted Bird", "response": ["Terence Blacker, an English publisher of Kosi\u0144ski's books and an author of children's books and mysteries for adults, wrote in response to the article's accusations in 2002:"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Terence Blacker"]}, {"page": "Joanna Trollope", "response": ["Often described as Aga sagas, for their rural themes, only two of Trollope's novels (by 2006) actually feature an Aga. The term's entry in The Oxford Companion to English Literature (2009) states that \"by no means all her work fits the generally comforting implications of the label\". Rejecting the label as not being accurate, Trollope told Lisa Allardice, writing for The Guardian in 2006: \"Actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak. It's all rather patronising isn't it?\" Allardice disputed the \"cosy reputation\" Trollope's books had acquired as her novels had \"tackled increasingly thorny issues including lesbianism, broken families and adoption, the mood growing darker with each novel.\" Terence Blacker, who coined the term for Trollope's fiction in Publishing News in 1992, admitted a decade later that he \"felt terribly guilty\" for lumbering Trollope with the phrase. Trollope told Bedell in 1993 that her fiction does \"the things the traditional novel has always done\" by mirroring reality and exploring \"people's emotional lives\". Bedell observed that her novels until then were: \"never suburban, which is the real condition of most of England. Trollopian action takes place in large village houses, at vast kitchen tables; her doctors, vicars, solicitors and craft-gallery owners may worry about money, as her own parents did, but they don't have any social anxieties: they are invited for drinks at the big house as a matter of course.
