Jutkiewicz received the club's Young Player of the Year award at the end of the season, and signed his first professional contract, of three years, in July 2006.

In the next game, playing as a lone striker against top-of-the-table Walsall, he scored his first senior goal, had another attempt cleared off the line, and was fouled for a penalty converted by Christian Roberts to give Swindon a 2\u20130 victory. On 17 March 2007, Jutkiewicz agreed to join Premier League club Everton.

Foyle brought a new signing to Vale Park though, with striker Nathan Lowndes joining on a free transfer from Plymouth Argyle.

Christian Hanson was also signed from non-league Billingham Synthonia. Foyle also signed Nigerian defender George Abbey, who had been released by Macclesfield Town. In January, Dean Smith retired as a player and took up coaching at Leyton Orient. As a replacement, former Vale player Tommy Widdrington joined until the end of the season on non-contract terms.

In March, club legend and former teammate of Foyle, Tony Naylor, joined on an emergency short-term contract, though never took to the field. Tony Dinning also was signed on loan from Bristol City.
