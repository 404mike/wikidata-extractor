In the mid-20th century she strongly influenced the revitalisation of home cookery in her native country and beyond with articles and books about European cuisines and traditional British dishes.\nBorn to an upper-class family, David rebelled against social norms of the day. In the 1930s she studied art in Paris, became an actress, and ran off with a married man with whom she sailed in a small boat to Italy, where their boat was confiscated. They reached Greece, where they were nearly trapped by the German invasion in 1941, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but she and her husband separated soon after and subsequently divorced.\nIn 1946 David returned to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by the contrast between the bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become accustomed in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, at the age of 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973.\nDavid's reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.  David's influence on British cooking extended to professional as well as domestic cooks, and chefs and restaurateurs of later generations such as Terence Conran, Simon Hopkinson, Prue Leith, Jamie Oliver, Tom Parker Bowles and Rick Stein have acknowledged her importance to them. In the US, cooks and writers including Julia Child, Richard Olney and Alice Waters have written of her influence.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Food writing", "response": ["The mock epic (A. J. Liebling, Calvin Trillin, the French writer Robert Courtine, and any good restaurant critic) is essentially comic and treats the small ambitions of the greedy eater as though they were big and noble, spoofing the idea of the heroic while raising the minor subject to at least temporary greatness. The mystical microcosmic, of which Elizabeth David and M. F. K. Fisher are the masters, is essentially poetic, and turns every remembered recipe into a meditation on hunger and the transience of its fulfillment.Gopnik, Adam. \"Dining Out: The Food Critic at Table,\" The New Yorker April 4, 2005.

Curry was introduced from the Indian subcontinent and adapted to English tastes from the eighteenth century with Hannah Glasse's recipe for chicken \"currey\". French cuisine influenced English recipes throughout the Victorian era. After the rationing of the Second World War, Elizabeth David's 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food had wide influence, bringing Italian cuisine to English homes. Her success encouraged other cookery writers to describe other styles, including Chinese and Thai cuisine. England continues to absorb culinary ideas from all over the world.", "Elizabeth David profoundly changed English cooking with her 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food. Written at a time of scarcity, her book began with \"perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing\":", "Italian cuisine is the most popular Mediterranean cuisine in England. In its current form, with plenty of pizza and pasta, inspired by Elizabeth David, its rise began after 1945. There were some Italian restaurants before World War II, but they mostly served a generalised haute cuisine. Soon after the war, Italian coffee bars appeared, the first places to trade on their Italianness; they soon started to sell simple and cheap Italian food such as minestrone soup, spaghetti bolognese and pizza. From the early 1960s, the slightly more elegant trattoria restaurants offered \"Italian specialities\" such as lasagne verde al forno (baked lasagne, coloured with spinach). Other Mediterranean influences include Greek moussaka, feta and taramasalata, Turkish doner and shish kebabs, and Middle Eastern hummus."]}, {"page": "Isabella Beeton", "response": ["The Book of Household Management has been edited, revised and enlarged several times since Beeton's death and is still in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Beeton's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.", "The Beetons partly followed the layout of Acton's recipes, although with a major alteration: whereas the earlier writer provided the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients, the recipes in The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine listed the components before the cooking process. Beeton 's standardised layout used for the recipes also showed the approximate costs of each serving, the seasonality of the ingredients and the number of portions per dish. According to the twentieth-century British cookery writer Elizabeth David, one of the strengths of Beeton's writing was in the \"clarity and details of her general instructions, her brisk comments, her no-nonsense asides\". Margaret Beetham, the historian, sees that one of the strengths of the book was the \"consistent principle of organisation which made its heterogeneous contents look uniform and orderly\", and brought a consistent style in presentation and layout. Whereas Daly and Forman consider such an approach as \"nothing if not formulaic\", Hughes sees it as \"the thing most beloved by the mid Victorians, a system\".", "Beeton and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are \"sometimes slapdash and misleading\", although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagn\u00e9's Larousse Gastronomique also contains errors. The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled \"how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse\u00a0... [Acton's] superior work\", while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that \"It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for.\" In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Beeton's work was only a \"fashionable\" stance to take and that the cook's writing \"simply makes you want to cook\". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the \"relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930\" may instead be explained by the \"progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers\". David comments that \"when plain English cooks\" were active in their kitchens, \"they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives\". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a \"fascinating source of information\" from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be \"the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era\"."]}, {"page": "1913 in literature", "response": ["*December 26 \u2013 Elizabeth David (n\u00e9e Gwynne), English cookery writer (died 1992)"]}, {"page": "1992 in literature", "response": ["*May 22 \u2013 Elizabeth David, English cookery writer (born 1913)"]}, {"page": "1950 in literature", "response": ["*Elizabeth David \u2013 A Book of Mediterranean Food"]}, {"page": "1970 in literature", "response": ["*Elizabeth David \u2013 Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen"]}, {"page": "Cookbook", "response": ["*A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) by Elizabeth David"]}]}}
