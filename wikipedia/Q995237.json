New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte. Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league, with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte proving to be unsuccessful. Clough would stay at Forest for another 11 seasons, but without Taylor would only add two League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club's trophy cabinet, and would struggle against alcoholism."]}, {"page": "List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winning players", "response": ["|Bryn Gunn||||Nottingham Forest||1||1980 ||"]}, {"page": "Brynley gunn", "response": ["#redirect Bryn Gunn"]}, {"page": "1980 European Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||15|| Bryn Gunn || || "]}, {"page": "1980 European Super Cup", "response": ["|DF || || Bryn Gunn"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["|Bryn Gunn"]}, {"page": "1978 New Zealand National Soccer League", "response": ["Both Blockhouse Bay and Eastern Suburbs greatly improved on their 1977 league performance to finish in the top four.
