His great-grandfather James (1730\u20131803) bought Farnley Hall from Sir Thomas Danby (of the family of Thomas Dany, first mayor of Leeds) in 1799, and in 1844 four Armitage brothers (including his father) founded the Farnley Ironworks, utilising the coal, iron and fireclay on their estate. His brother Edward Armitage was a member of the Royal Academy.\nArmitage was the uncle of Robert Armitage (MP), the great-uncle of Robert Selby Armitage, and first cousin twice removed of Edward Leathley Armitage.\nHe was raised at Avranches in France, and at Frankfurt and Offenbach in Germany. He attended the Sorbonne and King's College London. He became a physician, practising at the Marylebone Dispensary, in the Crimean War, and as a private consultant in London.  He was forced to abandon his medical career because of deteriorating vision, eventually becoming blind.\nArmitage decided to help make literature available to blind people through embossed type: in Britain this had become complicated by the proliferation of different standards. He formed the \"British and Foreign Society for Improving the Embossed Literature of the Blind\", later the \"British and Foreign Blind Association for Promoting the Education and Employment of the Blind\" and (after his death) the \"National Institute for the Blind\". This group decided to adopt the system of Louis Braille, and Armitage worked tirelessly for the adoption of Braille.\nIn 1871 he helped to establish the Royal Normal College for the Blind (later the Royal National College for the Blind) in London.\nHe was married to Harriett Black, and died on 23 October 1890 at Thurles, County Tipperary, Ireland, following a riding accident.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "GKT School of Medical Education", "response": ["File:Thomas Armitage.jpg|Thomas Armitage", "* Thomas Armitage, British physician and founder of the Royal National Institute of Blind People"]}, {"page": "Tom Armitage", "response": ["Thomas Armitage (25 April 1848 \u2013 21 September 1922) was an English first-class cricketer, who in 1877 took part in what are retrospectively recognised as the first two Test matches played by England.
