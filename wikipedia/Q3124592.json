Although there is agreement on the time and general manner of his death, it is not clear where this happened. Some believe he was beheaded on a Fife beach, following a battle at Fife Ness, near Crail. William Forbes Skene reads the Chronicle as placing Causant\u00edn's death at Inverdovat (by Newport-on-Tay), which appears to match the Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n.

This version is followed by Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men, pp. 188\u2013189.

The identity of Karl Hundason, unknown to Scots and Irish sources, has long been a matter of dispute, and it is far from clear that the matter is settled. The most common assumption is that Karl Hundason was an insulting byname (Old Norse for \"Churl, son of a Dog\") given to Macbeth by his enemies.However Macbeth's father may be called \"jarl Hundi\" in Nj\u00e1l's saga; Crawford, p. 72.

Much that was written was either directly transcribed from the earlier medieval chronicles themselves or was modelled closely upon them, even in the significant works of John of Fordun, Andrew Wyntoun and Walter Bower.Felix J. H. Skene & William Forbes Skene (ed.), John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish Nation, (Edinburgh, 1872), 200ff.; Donaldson, The Sources of Scottish History, p. 34: \"...\u00a0at what point its information about Scotland should receive credence is far from clear\". Though Wyntoun, Fordun and Bower may have had access to documents which are no longer extant, much of their information is either duplicated in other records or cannot be corroborated; for a survey of David's historical reputation, see Oram, David, pp. 203\u201325. For example, Bower includes in his text the eulogy written for David by Ailred of Rievaulx. This quotation extends to over twenty pages in the modern edition, and exerted a great deal of influence over what became the traditional view of David in later works about Scottish history.John MacQueen, Winnifred MacQueen and D. E. R. Watt (eds.), Scotichronicon by Walter Bower, vol. 3, (Aberdeen, 1995), 139ff. Historical treatment of David developed in the writings of later Scottish historians, and the writings of men like John Mair, George Buchanan, Hector Boece, and Bishop John Leslie ensured that by the 18th century a picture of David as a pious, justice-loving state-builder and vigorous maintainer of Scottish independence had emerged.Oram, David, pp. 213\u20137.", "In the 1980s, Barrow sought a compromise between change and continuity, and argued that the reign of King David was in fact a \"Balance of New and Old\".Barrow, \"The Balance of New and Old\", passim. Such a conclusion was a natural incorporation of an underlying current in Scottish historiography which, since William F. Skene's monumental and revolutionary three-volume Celtic Scotland: A History of Ancient Alban (1876\u201380), had been forced to acknowledge that \"Celtic Scotland\" was alive and healthy for a long time after the reign of David I.William Forbes Skene, Celtic Scotland: A History of Ancient Alban, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, 1876\u201380); see also, Edward J. Cowan, \"The Invention of Celtic Scotland\", pp. 1\u201323. Michael Lynch followed and built upon Barrow's compromise solution, arguing that as David's reign progressed, his kingship became more Celtic.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, pp. 82\u201383. Despite its subtitle, in 2004 in the only full volume study of David I's reign yet produced, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, its author Richard Oram further builds upon Lynch's picture, stressing continuity while placing the changes of David's reign in their context.Oram, David I, (Stroud, 2004)."]}, {"page": "Duncan II of Scotland", "response": ["William Forbes Skene viewed the conflict between Donald III and Duncan II as being essentially a conflict between \"the Celtic and the Saxon laws of succession\". In other words, it was a conflict between tanistry and hereditary monarchy, Donald being the legitimate heir under the former, Duncan and his brothers under the latter. Donald probably derived his support from the Gaels of Scotland, who formed the majority of the population. His supporters would have had reason to feel threatened by the large number of Anglo-Saxons who had arrived in Scotland under the reign of Malcolm III.
