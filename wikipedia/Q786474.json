G.

Grace reportedly reacted by demanding of Australian captain Harry Trott: \"Here, what's all this?\" Trott said to Jones: \"Steady, Jonah\". Jones replied: \"Sorry, doctor, she slipped\". There are multiple variations of the story and, although some sources have recorded that the incident happened in a Test match, there is little doubt that the game in question was the tour opener at Sheffield Park. This is separately confirmed by C. B. Fry and Stanley Jackson who were both playing in the match, Jackson batting with Grace at the time.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1944 edition\u00a0\u2013 Stanley Jackson's reminiscences.C. B.

They were designed by Sir Herbert Baker and the opening ceremony was performed by Sir Stanley Jackson, who had suggested the inclusion of the words The Great Cricketer in the dedication.Midwinter, p.154. On 12 September 2009, Grace was posthumously inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame at Lord's.
