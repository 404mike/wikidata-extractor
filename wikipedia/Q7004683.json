His plethora of published materials include articles, scripts, books, films, plays, songs, events and art; all of which have captured moments large and small, insignificant and epic through lateral thought, clarity and insight.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "XTC", "response": ["In 1997 (also reported as in late 1994), XTC found themselves freed from financial debt and from Virgin after \"making some heavy concessions\". Partridge fantasised that people from the label \"met in the dark and thought, 'These blokes are not making a living. We've had 'em all these years and we've got their catalogue and the copyright to their songs for evermore and we've stitched 'em up real good with a rotten deal so, erm, maybe we should let them go.' I like to think that it was a guilt thing.\" One of the group's first new recordings since the strike was released for the tribute album A Testimonial Dinner: The Songs of XTC (1995). \"The Good Things\", a Moulding song originally demoed for Oranges & Lemons, was credited under the pseudonym Terry and the Lovemen. In 1998, Song Stories, an authorized overview of the band's catalog by journalist and longtime friend Neville Farmer was published. Partridge said the book was badly edited and \"used the crappiest quotes\".", "In Song Stories, Neville Farmer comments that Partridge \"is the boss\u2014erratic but willful [and] runs the band on instinct\", while Moulding \"is the voice of calm ... a foil to Andy's radical side.\" Music journalist Peter Paphides felt that the songwriters' personalities \"couldn't seem more different,\" with Moulding \"phlegmatic, shy, and heartbreakingly pretty\" and Partridge an \"art-school dropout ... uptight, dominating and extrovert.\" In Moulding's view, Partridge also typically acted as an \"executive producer\" for albums while frequently undermining the authority of the actual credited producer.  Their recording approaches differed in that Moulding sometimes preferred spontaneous or imperfect performances, whereas Partridge working method was to refine a song through repeated takes. The band occasionally took to the term \"Andy-ness\" to describe Partridge's studio indulgences.  Despite this, they rarely found themselves encumbered by serious creative differences. In 1997, Moulding called one dispute over a Skylarking bass part the \"only real argument\" between him and Partridge in the band's history.", "According to biographer Neville Farmer, Partridge and Moulding tended to write about \"more general aspects of their lives and their attitudes\". Farmer added that \"Colin nor Andy handle political or religious matters with subtlety. If they have an idea about something, they say it straightforwardly. They are no more embarrassed about their view on the world than Andy is about his sex life. That makes them easy targets for criticism.\" For Partridge, other popular subject matter included financial shortage, factory work, comic book characters, seafaring, war, and ancient rituals. He described himself as an atheist and said he did not become interested in politics until circa 1979, when he voted for Margaret Thatcher \"purely because she was a woman. I was that naive. Now I'm very left.\"", "The band are often compared reverentially to 1960s acts such as the Who, the Kinks, and most frequently, the Beatles. In a 1991 article that focused on a resurgence of power pop groups, members of Jellyfish and the Posies reflected that they were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced. As the Posies' Jon Auer said: \"our '60s-ish-ness is actually early-'80s-ish-ness, a pop sensibility that came from listening to Squeeze and XTC\". According to Chris Ingham, acts such as Kula Shaker, the Shamen and the Stone Roses recruited engineer John Leckie chiefly because of his productions for the retro-psychedelic Dukes of Stratosphear records. According to Neville Farmer, the name XTC inspired the names of U2, R.E.M., and INXS. Japanese band Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her was named after the XTC song of similar title. Peter Gabriel is quoted: \"I've always looked to XTC for inventive songwriting, innovative production, and a sense of humor. It's their strong blend of personalities that make them one of the great British bands.\" Kurt Cobain of Nirvana said in 1991: \"There\u2019s a lot of good pop music. I\u2019ve always liked it\u2026bands like the Beatles, XTC, stuff like that.\""]}, {"page": "Oranges & Lemons (album)", "response": ["\"Across This Antheap\" is a track built on \"Latin percussion, my swampy, pulled Bluesy guitar, and Colin's burping little bass\". The lyrics are \"about the human inability to communicate. No more than these ants can communicate. ... and yes, there is a very cynical eye being cast on the human race.\" It was originally written for Skylarking but rejected by Todd Rundgren. Gregory wanted the song to be the album's closing track but his suggestion was vetoed. Fox considered it a potential single and urged Partridge to include \"'a kind of tacky, brassy-sounding keyboard,\" which I really didn't like, but he said, 'Yeah, it's so awful, it's almost ironic!' I just found it awful-sounding. ... I thought, 'He's had some good decisions as we've gone along so far\u2014maybe he's right!'\" Partridge programmed the percussion samples on a LinnDrum and Mastelloto played along on a kit. The end of the song includes the voices of the band members, Fox, and guests who visited the session that day, who may have included River Phoenix, Chris Squire, or journalist Neville Farmer."]}, {"page": "Garden of Earthly Delights", "response": ["Andy Partridge wrote \"Garden of Earthly Delights\" as a children's guide to the world dedicated to his son Harry Partridge. He said the song stemmed from \"a little musical figure\" he found playing a guitar's D string, which led to the lyrics and Arabic feel. Partridge had used the name as a working title for the theme to the 1983 film Ocean's Daughter. In the liner notes to Fuzzy Warbles, he wrote that the theme's melody \"was from a song I was working on [at the time] called 'Garden of Earthly Delights'.\" In a 2007 phone interview, he refused to answer whether the lyric \"can't all think like Chekov\" refers to the Star Trek character, Pavel Chekov, or the Russian playwright, Anton Chekhov. In Neville Farmer's 1998 biography Song Stories, it is stated that Partridge had the playwright in mind."]}, {"page": "Nonsuch (album)", "response": ["Described by band biographer Neville Farmer as \"a piece of near-Stratospheric psychedelia,\" \"Humble Daisy\" features multiple key changes and what Farmer perceives to be references to the Beach Boys and the Lovin' Spoonful in a musical structure Partridge described as \"a piece of dream logic.\" Written by Moulding, \"The Smartest Monkeys\" was described by Johan Kugelberg of Spin as \"the kind of social commentary that can only be born in a pub,\" and features jangley guitars. \"The Disappointed\" concerns itself with people who have been turned down romantically and come together to form an organisation \"of the disappointed,\" while \"Holly Up on Poppy\" is about Partridge's daughter Holly, Poppy being the name of the rocking horse she had. In writing the song, Partridge hoped to avoid the saccharine nature he felt plagued songs with similar subjects. \"Crocodile\" deals with jealousy and features what appears to be crocodile noises, but are in fact a sample of a tuned down pig's grunt.", "*Neville Farmer \u2013 chorus"]}, {"page": "The Big Express", "response": ["In late 1983, XTC released the holiday single \"Thanks for Christmas\" under the pseudonym Three Wise Men.

He also performed on the main stage at the Glastonbury Festival during those years. After the release of two solo efforts in 2010, Brown met up with fellow guitarist and bass player, Gary Rudd, forming a duo named Shackdusters.  Their debut joint release was Home and Dry (2011), with Home for Christmas following the next year. In 2012, they performed at The Lichfield Festival. Brown's repertoire had by then extended from slide acoustic guitar to playing lap steel guitar and weissenborn. In November 2015, Brown released his latest album, Grit, produced by Neville Farmer.  Grit, a so-called \"live in the studio\" album, saw a guest appearance from fellow guitarist and vocalist Andy Fairweather Low. The album included the song, \"Lancashire Blood on a Texas Floor\", in homage to two casualties at the Battle of the Alamo, who both hailed Brown's home town of Preston. Whilst, \"The Ballad of J. J. Cale\", paid tribute to another of Brown's musical inspirations, J. J. Cale."]}]}}
