Writing in The Guardian, Cynthia Bateman described that the first half of the match was \"of such little excitement that the Chesterfield fans, too far away to take on the Cambridge supporters, began fighting among themselves\".  Keith Blackmore of The Times suggested that \"for a long time [the game] was not a good advertisement for fourth division football\". Although Cambridge had started the first half strongly, Chesterfield dominated the early stages of the second half.  In the 60th minute, Cambridge made the first substitution of the match with Claridge coming on to replace John Taylor.  Having missed several chances, Dublin scored in the 77th minute to give Cambridge the lead.  Mick Leonard, the Chesterfield goalkeeper, was ruled to have carried the ball out after attempting to catch a misdirected shot, and conceded a corner.  Dublin out-jumped Chesterfield's defenders to head in Leadbitter's set piece and make it 1\u20130.  Almost immediately, Chesterfield replaced Chiedozie with Dave Waller.  With six minutes of the match remaining, Cambridge made their second substitution, with Leadbitter being taken off for Mike Cook.  Chesterfield had chances to score through Plummer and Waller but to no avail.  In the 88th minute, Jamie Hewitt's header was saved by the Cambridge goalkeeper John Vaughan.  Despite late chances to score for both teams, Cambridge secured promotion to the Third Division with a 1\u20130 victory.", "|MF ||12||Mike Cook "]}]}}
