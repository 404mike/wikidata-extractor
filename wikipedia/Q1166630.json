A left-back noted for his pace, he made 388 league and cup appearances for six clubs over a fourteen-year career in the English Football League.\nStarting his senior career at Everton in 1983, he was unable to make the grade at the First Division champions, despite helping the youth team to lift the FA Youth Cup, and so was allowed to leave for Shrewsbury Town in June 1985. After one season with the \"Shrews\" he signed with Brighton & Hove Albion for a \u00a335,000 fee in September 1986. In September 1987 he signed with Port Vale, where he spent seven years and made 184 league appearances. He helped the \"Valiants\" to win promotion out of the Third Division in 1989. He then spent January to November 1995 at Northampton Town, before transferring to Exeter City. After two seasons at Exeter he moved into non-league football with Morecambe and Newcastle Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darren", "response": ["*Darren Hughes (English footballer), English footballer", "*Darren Hughes (Gaelic footballer), Irish Gaelic footballer", "*Darren Hughes (gridiron football), American football player", "*Darren Hughes, New Zealand politician"]}, {"page": "Simon Mills (footballer)", "response": ["Unable to fit him into the side due to the form of Ray Walker and others, Rudge converted Mills from a midfielder to a right-back. He made 19 Third Division appearances in 1987\u201388, scoring five goals. He played 55 games in 1988\u201389, playing in partnership first with fellow centre-backs Phil Sproson and Bob Hazell (who both struggled with injuries) and later Gary West and Dean Glover (who were signed mid-season), alongside full-backs Alan Webb and Darren Hughes, in front of goalkeeper Mark Grew. This proved to be the most successful defence in the division, conceding just 48 goals in 46 league games. However a third-place finish meant that they had to overcome Bristol Rovers 2\u20131 over two legs in the play-off final, with Robbie Earle hitting both goals. Mills missed just one Second Division game in 1989\u201390, forming a formidable defensive partnership with Glover. He played 45 games in 1990\u201391, as Vale retained their second tier status. He played 40 games in the 1991\u201392 relegation season, scoring twice, and helped the club to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. However, in autumn 1992 he developed knee trouble and underwent a series of unsuccessful operations, limiting him to just three league appearances in 1992\u201393. He was given a free transfer in May 1994. After retiring as a professional, he later attempted a comeback with Northern Premier League Premier Division sides Boston United and Matlock Town."]}, {"page": "Darren John Hughes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Darren Hughes (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||3||Darren Hughes", "|DF ||3||Darren Hughes"]}, {"page": "Lawrie Pearson", "response": ["He was traded to league rivals Port Vale, along with \u00a325,000, in exchange for Russell Bromage in August 1987.

After goal machine Andy Jones was sold to First Division Charlton Athletic for \u00a3350,000 \u2013 a sale Rudge described as like 'cutting off my right arm' \u2013 Vale slid down the table. Alex Williams was also forced to retire with a back injury, leading to the return of a fit again Mark Grew in goal. More injuries came as Chris Banks had his nose broken after a reserve match at Barnsley when he was attacked by a gang of youths whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop. Alan Webb then suffered second degree burns at Preston North End's plastic pitch at Deepdale. The next month Rudge tried to replace Jones when he signed David Riley from Nottingham Forest for \u00a320,000. Despite a good start Riley soon entered a goal drought, as Vale went twelve league games without a win (including eight defeats). Robbie Earle missed much of this period with a hernia injury. In November Kevin Steggles was signed from West Bromwich Albion for 'a small fee' to replace the still-injured Webb. More signings were made with former England international Peter Barnes arriving on loan from Manchester City, and 'hard-working' Simon Mills purchased from York City for \u00a335,000.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Darren Hughes", "|\u2013||DF||||Darren Hughes||1||0||0||0||1", "| September 1987 || DF ||  || Darren Hughes || Brighton & Hove Albion || \u00a35,000 || ", "| September 1987 || DF ||  || Darren Hughes || Brighton & Hove Albion || September 1987 || "]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Darren Hughes"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Darren Hughes", "|\u2013||FW||||Darren Hughes||1||0||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Darren Hughes"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Darren Hughes", "|\u2013||DF||||Darren Hughes||2||0||0||0||3"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season started modestly, with two wins in the four August games. In September only Lee Glover, Tony Naylor and Martin Foyle could find the net, but the Vale won six points from their five games. To help with his recovery from a serious injury, Ray Walker spent some time on loan at Cambridge United, and won back his first team place in the Vale starting eleven upon his return. Meanwhile, Tony Kelly arrived at the club from Bolton Wanderers, but after a brief spell moved on to Millwall. Vale's poor attack was highlighted in October, though the defence ensured three draws from five games. In November, Darren Hughes was allowed to leave the club for Northampton Town. Rudge decided to make another big signing, and bought winger Steve Guppy from Newcastle United for \u00a3225,000. On 5 November, Vale lost all their inhibitions in front of goal, beating Southend United 5\u20130 with five different scorers. However their draw with Swindon Town would prove to be the only point gained in December, as Vale were stuck in a relegation dogfight. John Jeffers spent January on loan at Shrewsbury Town. During this spell defender Kevin Scott arrived on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. The team gelled, forming a five-game unbeaten run based on just two goals conceded to shoot up the table. In March, midfielder Ian Bogie was signed from Leyton Orient for a \u00a350,000 fee. Potteries derby day finally came on 14 March, and 19,510 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 1\u20131 draw with Stoke City, Naylor scoring the Vale's goal. Five defeats in seven games followed, raising concerns of the drop. However the Vale were unbeaten in their final five games to ensure safety. This included a 3\u20133 draw at Elm Park that saw the \"Valiants\" come from three goals down to claim a point.
