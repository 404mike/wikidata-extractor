Growing up in a home surrounded by pets, he originally trained to become a veterinary surgeon. An allergic dermatitis acquired in his final year of study forced a change of career however, and so led him into the field of writing about pets and their care. He has since become a regular contributor of articles on this subject to a wide range of newspapers and magazines in the UK and abroad, and also participates frequently in radio and television programmes. As of 2010 his books have sold over five million copies, and have been translated into 30 different languages. Alderton's titles have won awards in the US from the Cat Writers' Association of America and the Maxwell Medallion from the Dog Writers\u2019 Association of America, as well as being nominated for the Sir Peter Kent Conservation Book Prize. He has also chaired the National Council for Aviculture, the umbrella organisation for bird-keeping clubs and associations in the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of freshwater aquarium fish species", "response": ["* Encyclopedia of Aquarium and Pond Fish (2005) (David Alderton)"]}, {"page": "List of aquarium diseases", "response": ["* Encyclopedia of Aquarium and Pond Fish (2005) (David Alderton), DK Publishing, "]}, {"page": "Callichthyidae", "response": ["The subfamily Corydoradinae includes about 90% of the species in the family Callichthyidae and is one of the most diverse siluriform assemblages in the Neotropics, with about 170 valid species.
