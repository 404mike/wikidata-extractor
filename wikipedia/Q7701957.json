He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Antrim senior team, while also joining the under-21 and senior sides. He made his senior debut during the 1981 \"B\" championship. McNaughton immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland \"B\" medals and six Ulster medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion.\nAs a member of the Ulster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, McNaughton ended his career without a Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a seven-time ulster medallist with Ruar\u00ed \u00d3g Cushendall. In addition to this he also won eight championship medals.\nThroughout his career McNaughton made 27 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1997 championship.\nIn retirement from playing McNaughton became involved in team management. Having coached at almost every grade with Ruar\u00ed \u00d3g, he also took charge of the Antrim minor, under-21 and senior teams as joint manager.\nMcNaughton is regarded as one of Antrim's greatest ever players and as one of the best players never to win an All-Ireland medal. In 2013 he was chosen at left wing-back on a special \"Stars of the 1980s\" team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of All Stars Awards winners (hurling)", "response": ["| MD || 20px|border Terence McNaughton || Antrim||1"]}, {"page": "McNaughton", "response": ["* Terence McNaughton (born 1964), Irish hurling manager"]}, {"page": "2007 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship", "response": ["|Terence McNaughtonDominic McKinley"]}, {"page": "1965 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Terence McNaughton, hurling player and manager."]}, {"page": "Liam Sheedy", "response": ["In July 2017, Sheedy was approached by Antrim senior hurling team joint-manager Terence McNaughton with a view to joining his management team in an advisory capacity.
