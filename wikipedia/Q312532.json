He is regarded by many as one of the world's leading experts on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and is particularly noted for his biographies of Hitler.He was the leading disciple of the German historian Martin Broszat, and until his retirement, he was a professor at the University of Sheffield. Kershaw has called Broszat an \"inspirational mentor\" who did much to shape his understanding of Nazi Germany. Kershaw served as historical adviser on numerous BBC documentaries, notably The Nazis: A Warning from History and War of the Century. He taught a module titled \"Germans against Hitler\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fascism", "response": ["Historians, political scientists, and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism. Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.\" Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow. According to many scholars, fascism\u2014especially once in power\u2014has historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far right.; ; ; ; ; ; Laclau (1977);  One common definition of the term, frequently cited by reliable sources as a standard definition, is that of historian Stanley G.

On the other hand, American destroyers escorting convoys had been effectively intervening in the Battle of the Atlantic with German and Italian ships and submarines, and the immediate war declaration made the Second Happy Time possible for U-boats. Franklin D. Roosevelt had said in his Fireside Chat on 9 December 1941 that Germany and Italy considered themselves to be in a state of war with the United States.

They just had to be apathetic.\" Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, \"In My Country There Is Problem\" (also known as \"Throw the Jew Down the Well\"), he says, \"Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic?

In this context the term has been used to describe how certain leaders, when put to positions of immense power, seem to become irrationally self-confident in their own abilities, increasingly reluctant to listen to the advice of others and progressively more impulsive in their actions.", "The proverb \"pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall\" (from the biblical Book of Proverbs, 16:18)(or pride goeth before the fall) is thought to sum up the modern use of pride. Pride is also referred to as \"pride that blinds,\" as it often causes a committer of pride to act in foolish ways that belie common sense. In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, \"that pride that goes just before the fall.\" In his two-volume biography of Adolf Hitler, historian Ian Kershaw uses both 'hubris' and 'nemesis' as titles. The first volume, Hubris, describes Hitler's early life and rise to political power. The second, Nemesis, gives details of Hitler's role in the Second World War, and concludes with his fall and suicide in 1945."]}, {"page": "Denazification", "response": ["British historian Ian Kershaw in his book The \"Hitler Myth\": Image and Reality in the Third Reich writes about the various surveys carried out at the German population:"]}, {"page": "Edith Cavell", "response": ["In 1906 she took a temporary post as matron of the Manchester and Salford Sick and Poor and Private Nursing Institution and worked there for about nine months.
