Manichaean theology taught a dualistic view of good and evil. A key belief in Manichaeism is that the powerful, though not omnipotent good power (God), was opposed by the eternal evil power (devil). Humanity, the world, and the soul are seen as the by-product of the battle between God's proxy, Primal Man, and the devil. The human person is seen as a battle-ground for these powers: the soul defines the person, but it is under the influence of both light and dark. This contention plays out over the world as well as the human body\u2014neither the Earth nor the flesh were seen as intrinsically evil, but rather possessed portions of both light and dark. Natural phenomena (such as rain) were seen as the physical manifestation of this spiritual contention. Therefore, the Manichaean view explained the existence of evil by positing a flawed creation in the formation of which God took no part and which constituted rather the product of a battle by the devil against God.Bevan, A.

Among the adherents were a significant number of Italians who took refuge in Poland.James Hastings Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art p 785  \u2013 2001 \"The first Unitarians were Italians, and the majority took refuge in Poland, where the laxity of the laws and the independence of the nobility secured for them a toleration which would have been denied to their views in other countries.\"The encyclopedia of Protestantism 137 Hans Joachim Hillerbrand \u2013 2004 \"The so-called Golden Age of Unitarianism in Transylvania (1540\u20131571) resulted in a rich production of works both in Hungarian and Latin\". In the 17th century, significant repression in Poland led many Unitarians to flee or be killed for their faith, notably Katarzyna Weiglowa. From the 16th to 18th centuries, Unitarians in Britain often faced significant political persecution, including John Biddle, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Theophilus Lindsey. In England, the first Unitarian Church was established in 1774 on Essex Street, London, where today's British Unitarian headquarters is still located.Erwin Fahlbusch The encyclopedia of Christianity 5 603 2008 \"Lindsey attempted but failed to gain legal relief for Anglican Unitarians, so in 1774 he opened his own distinctly Unitarian church on Essex Street, London, where today's British Unitarian headquarters are still located.\""]}, {"page": "Crescent", "response": ["While some Islamic organisations since the 1970s have embraced the crescent as their logo or emblem (e.g. Crescent International magazine, established 1980), Muslim publications tend to emphasize that the interpretation of the crescent, historically used on the banners of Muslim armies, as a \"religious symbol\" of Islam was an error made by the \"Christians of Europe\".\"Like the Crusaders, the Christians of Europe were misled into a belief that the crescent was the religious symbol of Islam\" Islamic Review 30 (1942), p. 70., \"many Muslim scholars reject using the crescent moon as a symbol of Islam.

Another tale has it being entrusted to and then misappropriated by Judas. One tradition suggests that Joseph and Mary used the gold to finance their travels when they fled Bethlehem after an angel had warned, in a dream, about King Herod's plan to kill Jesus. And another story proposes the theory that the myrrh given to them at Jesus' birth was used to anoint Jesus' body after his crucifixion."]}, {"page": "David MacRitchie", "response": ["Fairy Euhemerism, as developed by MacRitchie attempts to rationally explain the origin of fairies in British folklore and regards fairies as being a folk-memory of a \"small-statured pre-Celtic race\" or what Tylor theorised as possible folk memories of the aborigines of Britain.The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries, by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, 1911, p. 234 Tylor, \"Primitive Culture\", 1871, pp. 385\u2013386. MacRitchie's theory subsequently became known in the late 19th century by folklorists as the \"Ethnological or Pygmy Theory\".Wentz, 1911, pp. 234\u2013235. The euhemeristic theory of fairies became considerably popular through MacRitchie's key works The Testimony of Tradition (1890) and Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893).\"Were Fairies an Earlier Race of Men?\", Canon J. A. Macculloch, Folklore, Vol. 43, No. 4, 31 December 1932, p. 366.\"Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics\", Part 9, James Hastings, Kessinger Publishing (reprint), 2003. p. 126. Different theories, however, in the late 19th century and early 20th century surfaced concerning the racial origin of the proposed dwarf aborigines of Britain and these theories ranged from proposing that they were real African Pygmies, Eskimos or a short statured Mediterranean race.\"Folklore and the fantastic in nineteenth-century British fiction\", Jason Marc Harris, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, pp.64\u201366.The fairy tales of Oscar Wilde, Jarlath Killeen, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, p. 137.The different racial theories are found discussed at length by T. Rice Holmes in his Ancient Britain and the invasions of Julius Caesar (1907). MacRitchie himself argued in his Testimony of Tradition, under a chapter subheading entitled \"A Hairy Race\" (p.\u00a0167), that they were somewhat connected to the Lapps or Eskimos, but were a distinct race because of their very long beards, concluding: \"one seems to see the type of a race that was even more like the Ainu than the Lapp, or the Eskimo, although closely connected in various ways with all of these\" (p.\u00a0173). In MacRitchie's view the indigenous population of Britain were thus a \"quasi-European\" Ainu race, with minor Mongoloid traits who he considered ancestral to the Picts, a view earlier proposed by Walter Scott.Scott pioneered the \"Lapp\u2212Dwarf parallel\", writing \"there seems reason to conclude that these duergar [dwarfs] were originally nothing else than the diminutive natives of the Lappish, Lettish and Finnish nations.\"Science, Vol. 21, No. 523, 10 February 1893, pp. 82\u201383.Cowan, 2001, p. 21. The identification of fairies with Picts MacRitichie based primarily on the earlier accounts by Adam of Bremen and the Historia Norwegi\u00e6 which describe the Picts of Orkney as \"only a little exceeding pygmies in stature\".Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), footnote 51 MacRitchie also discovered through The Orcadian Sketch-Book by Walter Traill Dennison (1880) that legends across Scotland describe the homes (usually underground dwellings) of the fairies as \"Pict's Houses\" and so he believed the Picts were literally the basis of fairies in British folklore.The testimony of tradition, David MacRitchie, Paul. Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, 1890, pp.60\u201367.Cowan, 2001, p. 21. In Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), The Northern Trolls (1898) and The Aborigines of Shetland and Orkney (1924) MacRitchie attempted to further identify the fairies of British folklore with the Finfolk of Orkney mythology, the Trows of Shetland myth, the Fianna of Old Irish Literature and the Trolls as well as the Svart\u00e1lfar and Svart\u00e1lfaheimr (elves or dwarfs) of Norse mythology. A 12th-century Irish manuscript is found referenced in Fians, Fairies and Picts which equates the Fianna to fairies, but this is one of the few literary sources MacRitchie used as evidence; instead he turned to philology and comparative mythology.Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), footnote 21"]}, {"page": "Douay\u2013Rheims Bible", "response": ["* Much of the above text was taken from the article \"English Versions\" by Sir Frederic G.
