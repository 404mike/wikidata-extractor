From there he moved to the Postmaster General's Office in 1884 when he also began taking courses at University College London/ He received an LLB degree at the latter in 1890.  He went to Treasury in 1899. Following the end of the Second Boer War in June 1902, Higgs travelled to Natal to examine the working of the Civil Service of that colony on behalf of its government. He stayed in South Africa for six months from October 1902 until late Spring 1903. He was appointed Private Secretary of then-Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman in 1905 serving for three years before returning to Treasury in 1908.\nHiggs was a founding member of the British Economic Association in 1890 and contributed to securing a Royal Charter for it in 1902, which was followed by a name change to the Royal Economic Society. He was Secretary for the organization from 1892 to 1905 and assistant editor of The Economic Journal from 1896 to 1905 during the tenure of F.Y. Edgeworth as editor.Among other subjects, Higgs wrote on the economist Richard Cantillon and edited what became the standard version of Cantillon's  Essai sur la nature du commerce en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. He also wrote on the Physiocrats, the financial system of the United Kingdom, and financial reform. He also compiled a historical bibliography on economic thought. J.M. Keynes in his obituary of Higgs (The Economic Journal, 1940) explains that \"the unfinished volumes of the Economic Bibliography, were based on [H. S.] Foxwell\u2019s collections, which Higgs edited for a Joint Committee, under the chairmanship of W.R. Scott, representing the British Academy, the RES and the Goldsmiths\u2019 Company, each of which contributed to the substantial expense. This was a laborious work to which Higgs gave the bulk of his time in his last years, but it was work done at a time when he was no longer reliable in the small, often unimportant, points of accurate detail which are nevertheless the essence of such a project. It was a task, not really suited to his gifts, undertaken out of loyalty and affection to Foxwell with the pious oblject of harvesting some part of the labours and scholarship which Foxwell's own temperament never allowed him to garner himself.\"Higgs was an early supporter of and contributor to Dictionary of Political Economy, Inglis Palgrave, ed., (1894, ..., 1908), to which he contributed 19 entries.  He edited the only edition of the Dictionary not edited by Palgrave, adding Palgrave's name to the title and penning 40 more entries .", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clara Collet", "response": ["Collet also enrolled at University College London and in 1880 graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, making her one of the first women graduates from the University of London. In October 1885 Collet moved to College Hall, on Gordon Square, and started to study for a master's degree in Moral and Political Philosophy, which included psychology and economics. While studying at University College London she took the Teacher's Diploma. In 1886 she and Henry Higgs were jointly awarded the Joseph Hume Scholarship in Political Economy. Collet was awarded an M.A. in 1887.", "In her diaries Collet recorded that \"this investigative work has many drawbacks... I would give it up and will give it up whenever I see a chance of earning a certain \u00a360 even by lectures on economics\". While working for Booth she coached girls and occasionally stood in for Henry Higgs to give lectures on economics at Toynbee Hall. Collet ended her employment with Booth in 1892. She remained close to Booth and her former colleagues. In 1904 she and her former colleagues attended Booth's celebratory dinner in 1904. In 1931 she contributed data on domestic service to Hubert Llewellyn Smith's New Survey of London Life and Labour."]}, {"page": "Higgs", "response": ["*Henry Higgs (1864\u20131940), English civil servant, economist and historian of economic thought"]}, {"page": "Richard Cantillon", "response": ["Although there is evidence that Richard Cantillon wrote a wide variety of manuscripts, only his Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En G\u00e9n\u00e9ral (abbreviated Essai) survives.Brewer 1992, p. 9 Written in 1730,Cantillon 2010, p. 13; In the introduction to the Ludwig von Mises Institute's 2010 edition of Essai, Mark Thornton and Chantal Saucier write, \"Based on the book itself and other evidence, we are now reasonably confident that Cantillon completed the manuscript in 1730.\" Brewer, p. 9 it was published in French in 1755,Spengler , p. 61; Essai was published roughly twenty-one years after Cantillon's death. and was translated into English by Henry Higgs in 1932.Hone 1994, p. 96 Evidence suggests that Essai had tremendous influence on the early development of economic science. However, Cantillon's treatise was largely neglected during the 19th century.Cantillon 2010, p. 15 In the late 19th century it was \"rediscovered\" by William Stanley Jevons, who considered it the \"cradle of political economy\".Jevons 1881, p. 342; writes Jevons, \"Cantillon's essay is, more emphatically than any other single work, 'the cradle of political economy.'\" Cantillon 2010, p. 15; Editors Mark Thornton and Chantal Saucier write, \"The influence of Cantillon's manuscript was largely unknown and the book had fallen so far into neglect that William Stanley Jevons was said to have \"rediscovered\" it in the late 19th century.\" Since then, Cantillon's Essai has received growing attention. Essai is considered the first complete treatise on economic theory,Jevons 1881, pp. 341\u201343; writes Jevons, \"The Essai is far more than a mere essay or even collection of disconnected essays like those of Hume. It is a systematic and connected treatise, going over in a concise manner nearly the whole field of economics, with the exception of taxation.\" Rothbard 1995, p. 345; Cantillon 2010, p. 13; Brewer 1992, p. 11 and Cantillon has been called the \"father of enterprise economics\".Cantillon 2010, p. 5", "While the Essai was not published until 1755 as a result of heavy censorship in France, it did widely circulate in the form of an unpublished manuscript between its completion and its publication.Rothbard 1995, p. 360 It notably influenced many direct forerunners of the classical school of thought, including Turgot and other physiocrats.Rothbard 1995, pp. 360\u201361 Cantillon was a major influence on physiocrat Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, who has probably had access to his work through the marquis de Mirabeau, who possessed a manuscript of the Essai since 1740.Schumpeter 1954, pp. 209\u201310; writes Schumpeter, \"Cantillon's great work fared better both because of its well-rounded systematic or even didactic form and because it had the good fortune to gain, long before its actual publication, the enthusiastic approval and the effective support of two very influential men, Gournay and Mirabeau.\" Furthermore, Schumpeter establishes, \"An analogy may be helpful: Cantillon was to Quesnay, and Petty was to Cantillon, what Ricardo was to Marx.\" While it is evident that the Essai influenced Quesnay, to what degree remains controversial. There is evidence that Quesnay did not fully understand, or was not completely aware of, Cantillon's theories.Brewer 1992, p. 168; Brewer cites a conversation between Quesnay and Mirabeau, as chronicled by the latter. Many of Quesnay's economic beliefs were elucidated previously in the Essai,Brewer 1992, pp. 174\u201375 but Quesnay did reject a number of Cantillon's premises, including the scarcity of land and Cantillon's population theory.Brewer 1992, pp. 159\u201375 Also, Quesnay recognised the scarcity of capital and capital accumulation as a prerequisite for investment. Nevertheless, Cantillon was considered the \"father of physiocracy\" by Henry Higgs, due to his influence on Quesnay.Higgs 1892, p. 454 It is also possible that Cantillon influenced Scottish economist James Steuart, both directly and indirectly.Brewer 1992, p. 175; Brewer cites Steuart's reference to a tract by Phillip Cantillon, which in turn was based largely on Essai, and the many similarities between Steuart's Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy and Cantillon's Essai."]}, {"page": "Royal Economic Society", "response": ["The secretary of the BEA, Henry Higgs, proposed that the council apply for royal charter ten years after its inauguration.
