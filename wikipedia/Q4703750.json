In late 1988, while on holiday in Spain, Mike Edwards, Gen, and Al Doughty decided to leave the band they were in at the time, and form their own band. The name of the band came about when they realised that they were three \"Joneses\" sitting on a beach in Spain surrounded by people called Jesus.", "Since the mid-2000s, Jesus Jones have continued performing live.  In August 2011 the band went on a short tour (dubbed on one poster \"The World's Smallest World Tour\"), playing 3 shows in Australia before closing with a show in Japan. In November 2011 the band were due to perform in the UK in Birmingham and London, but the dates were postponed due to bass player Al Doughty being ill. They took place in January 2012. The band also toured the UK in December 2013 as part of The Wonder Stuff's 'Sleigh The UK' tour. In March 2015 the band again returned to Australia and New Zealand for a five city tour.", "* Al Doughty (born Alan Jaworski, 31 January 1966, Plymouth) \u2013 bass (1988\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Doubt (album)", "response": ["*Al Doughty \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Al Daughty", "response": ["#REDIRECT Al Doughty"]}, {"page": "Alan Doughty", "response": ["#REDIRECT Al Doughty"]}, {"page": "Al Jaworski", "response": ["#REDIRECT Al Doughty"]}, {"page": "Alan Jaworski", "response": ["#REDIRECT Al Doughty"]}, {"page": "Doughty", "response": ["* Al Doughty (born 1966), British musician and bassist"]}]}}
