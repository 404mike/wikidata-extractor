Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard.

He stated: \"We will have a statue if we buy it ourselves\"; and made it clear that the people wanted \"something whereby we can show our children the form of one we love so well and instil in them the good qualities he possessed.
