He was the elder brother of the botanist John Joseph Bennett.Bennett was born at Hackney and practiced as a surgeon, but his chief pursuit was always zoology. In 1822 he attempted to establish an entomological society, which later became a zoological society in connection with the Linnean Society. This in turn became the starting point of the Zoological Society of London, of which Bennett was Secretary from 1831 to 1836.His works included The Tower Menagerie (1829) and The Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society (1831). He also wrote, in conjunction with G. T. Lay, the section on Fishes in the Zoology of Beechey's Voyage (1839).\nIn 1835 he described a new species of African crocodile, Mecistops leptorhynchus, the validity of which was confirmed in 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1797", "response": ["** Edward Turner Bennett, English zoologist, writer (d. 1836)"]}, {"page": "Sifaka", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Edward Turner Bennett"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Edward Turner Bennett (1797\u20131836), English zoologistAbbreviation in zoology: Bennett  who described a new species of African crocodile"]}, {"page": "Chinchilla", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Edward Turner Bennett"]}, {"page": "Viverridae", "response": ["In 1833, Edward Turner Bennett described the Malagasy fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and subordinated the Cryptoprocta to the Viverridae.

The common name is the same as the generic name of the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with viverrids, mongooses, and Felidae, its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics."]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Bennett \u2013 Edward Turner Bennett (1797\u20131836) general zoology"]}, {"page": "Cryptoprocta", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Edward Turner Bennett"]}, {"page": "1836 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Edward Turner Bennett, zoologist and writer (born 1797)"]}, {"page": "William Herbert (botanist)", "response": ["Early interested in natural history, and a good shot, he helped James Rennie to edit Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne in 1833, and contributed notes to Edward Turner Bennett's edition of the work in 1837. He wrote much for the Botanical Register and Botanical Magazine, particularly on the subject of bulbous plants. He cultivated a large number of these plants at Spofforth, and at Mitcham, Surrey; many of these were lost to cultivation. His standard volume on this group of plants, Amaryllidace\u00e6,Amaryllidaceae, an attempt to arrange the Monocotyledonous Orders (1837) was issued in 1837. His Crocorum Synopsis appeared in the miscellaneous portion of the Botanical Register for 1843-4-5. Contributions on hybridisation made by him to the Journal of the Horticultural Society were the outcome of observation and experiment. A History of the Species of Crocus was reprinted separately from that journal, edited by John Lindley in 1847, just after his death. The genus Herbertia of Sweet commemorated his name."]}]}}
