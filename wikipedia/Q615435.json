In childhood he and a brother Richard (1723\u20131792) were for unknown reasons sent to the care of a \"Nurse Ball\" at nearby Condover, where they lived until 1739. He began formal education at Shrewsbury School in 1737 and was later sent in 1739 to The King's School, Chester, where his father then lived and worked. His first music master was a Mr Baker, the cathedral organist,ODNB entry for Burney . and a pupil of Dr John Blow. Returning to Shrewsbury at the age of 15, Burney continued his musical studies for three years under his half-brother, James Burney, organist of St Mary's Church, and was then sent to London as a pupil of Dr Thomas Arne for three years.A detailed family tree of the Burney family from the late 17th to the late 19th century appears in The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame D'Arblay).

His second son was the Rev. Charles Burney, a major donor of books to the British Museum, and his second daughter was Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay. Her published diary and letters contain many minute and interesting particulars of her father's public and private life, and of his friends and contemporaries, including his initial opposition to her marriage to the French refugee Alexandre D'Arblay in 1793 and to her sister Charlotte's remarriage to the pamphleteer and stock jobber Ralph Broome in 1798.The Journals and Letters..., Vol. IV, West Humble 1797\u20131801, pp. 116\u201325 ff. A life of Burney was compiled by Madame D'Arblay and appeared in 1832, but it has been criticized consistently for being eulogistic.\"It is an account distorted by frequent inaccuracy and by Fanny's attempt, surely prompted by an over-zealous sense of duty, to paint her father in the best possible light.

Her half-brother Rear Admiral James Burney (1750\u20131821), having separated from his wife, wished to move back in with his father and sister, but his father forbade it. So there was family consternation when Sarah and James absconded together and spent the years 1798\u20131803 living in some penury in Bristol and then London. It has even been suggested that their relations were incestuous.E. g. in a somewhat speculative, biographically based critique of Fanny Burney's works: Margaret Doody, Frances Burney: The Life in The Works (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1988), p. 277 ff. The assumption has been challenged in detail in a more recent, closely researched account of Burney's life and personality.
