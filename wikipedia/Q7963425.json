An undemonstrative player who made his reputation by conceding very few byes in large totals compiled by stronger teams, Luckes started slowly in terms of the numbers of dismissals, but developed into one of the leading keepers of his day, high in the fielding statistics tables for several seasons. \nLuckes made his debut in 1924, and became Somerset's regular wicketkeeper in 1927. But after two seasons, he suffered nearly four years of ill-health, and was able to play in only a few matches in 1929 and 1930, and none at all in 1931. The high regard that Somerset had for Luckes was reflected by the fact that he was maintained on the staff during this long absence: for one of the perennially more cash-strapped counties, with one of the smaller playing staffs, this was a rare degree of commitment. Somerset used a variety of amateur and professional wicketkeepers in Luckes' absence, including Seymour Clark, the ultimate non-batsman, and Frank Lee, the opening batsman who later became a Test umpire. And Luckes was able to return for the second half of the 1932 season.\nHe then remained as the regular wicketkeeper for the county up to and beyond the Second World War, standing up at the wicket to all but the fastest deliveries from Arthur Wellard and Bill Andrews and even in his last match, at the age of 48, managing a stumping off the quick bowler Jim Redman. \nLuckes was a useful batsman, but after his illness Somerset appear to have decided that he should not be subjected to the stress of batting high in the order, despite an at-times lack of depth to the county's batting. That decision accounts for the very high proportion of \"not out\" innings \u2013 212 out of 564 innings in all \u2013 in Luckes' career figures. Occasionally, he was allowed to bat higher and in 1937, against Kent at Bath, batting at No 5, he made 121 not out, the only first-class century of his career.Luckes returned to first-class cricket after the Second World War and set a county record with 77 dismissals in 1946. But at the end of the 1948 season, with Luckes now 47, Somerset recruited Harold Stephenson from Durham, and Stephenson took over the wicketkeeping role after a few games of the 1949 season, going on to break Luckes' county record in his first year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Gimblett", "response": ["On the final Friday of Gimblett's trial, Somerset found themselves a player short for the match that started the following day against Essex at Frome when the amateur Laurie Hawkins reported in sick. Gimblett was told to get himself to Frome: Daniell arranged for the wicketkeeper Wally Luckes, who had a car, to pick him up from Bridgwater. Gimblett missed the bus from Taunton, and hitched a lift in a lorry. Somerset won the toss and chose to bat: three batsmen were out for 35, and at lunch the score was 105 for five. Soon after lunch, Dickie Burrough was out and Gimblett came to the wicket with Somerset six wickets down for 107 runs, joining Arthur Wellard.Foot, pp. 64\u201366."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Somerset were captained for the only time by educator Jack Meyer but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only Harold Gimblett reliable through the season. Michael Walford played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and Playfair called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\". The main bowler was veteran Arthur Wellard who was supported by all-rounders Bertie Buse and Johnny Lawrence, slow left armer Horace Hazell, captain Meyer and new pace bowler Maurice Tremlett. The veteran Wally Luckes kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims. Other players were Bill Andrews in his final season, Frank Lee in his final season before becoming an umpire, Hugh Watts, George Woodhouse, Mandy Mitchell-Innes and Miles Coope.Playfair, pp. 104\u2013105."]}, {"page": "Frank Lee (cricketer)", "response": ["His best batting year was 1938, when he scored 2,019 runs at an average of 44.86. He bowled only occasionally, but against Warwickshire at Taunton in 1933 he took five wickets for 53 runs. For several seasons right up to his retirement, he acted as reserve wicketkeeper if regular Somerset keeper Wally Luckes was ill or injured."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Wally Luckes (1924\u20131949) 365 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Horace Fisher", "response": ["He is notable as the first bowler to ever claim a hat trick of LBW victims, in the course of taking 5 for 12 against Somerset at Sheffield in August 1932. Umpire Alex Skelding, after dispatching Mandy Mitchell-Innes for five and then Bill Andrews first ball in the same manner, stared up the wicket at the new man Wally Luckes, when the third appeal was made. After a pregnant pause, he stated, \"As God's my witness, that's out, too\". In the same match, Fisher posted his highest ever first-class score in Yorkshire's only innings, an unbeaten 76, as Yorkshire ran out winners by an innings and 93. Earlier that week Fisher took six wickets for 11 runs, against Leicestershire at Bradford, which remained his best bowling return."]}, {"page": "Seymour Clark", "response": ["Clark, a locomotive driver with the Great Western Railway, did not play any cricket until he was 25, when he began playing for a railways team. Three years later he was called into the Somerset side for five matches when regular wicketkeeper Wally Luckes was ill. He took eight catches, and Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1931 said that he \"rendered useful service in that capacity\". He stood up to the wicket to all bowlers, even the fastest. The county offered him a professional contract but he decided to stay with the railway.Irving Rosenwater, \"And never a run did come\", The Cricketer, December 1975, pp. 23, 28."]}, {"page": "Harold Stephenson", "response": ["The following season, however, he succeeded the long-serving Wally Luckes as the regular wicketkeeper and, despite missing half a dozen matches, he set a new county record for dismissals, with 39 catches and 44 stumpings for Somerset (plus two more catches in an end-of-season representative match). The number of stumpings remains a Somerset record. Wisden said that he \"exceeded expectations\" and added: \"Some of his stumpings off the slow bowlers were remarkably clever and quick enough to suggest optical tests for umpires.\" He also made more than 700 runs, batting mostly down the batting order at No 7 or No 8."]}, {"page": "Michael Spurway", "response": ["Spurway played cricket for the Somerset Stragglers while at university. He won a place in the Somerset county team as a wicketkeeper-batsman in three games of first-class cricket in July 1929, but yielded his place in the team to his brother, Francis, who had played irregularly for Somerset between 1920 and 1929: both were substitutes for Somerset's regular wicketkeeper, Wally Luckes, who was ill for much of the season. Michael Spurway played against Leicestershire at Taunton, and against Sussex and Derbyshire at Bath. Free-hitting, he was known as \"Slogger Spurway\"."]}, {"page": "Reggie Ingle", "response": ["Ingle was famously the captain when Harold Gimblett arrived at Frome as an unknown for his legendary first-class debut. Players such as Arthur Wellard, Horace Hazell, Wally Luckes and Bill Andrews played as professionals for Somerset for many seasons and developed under Ingle. Ingle, wrote Foot, \"had a gift for what today is rather glibly known as motivation\". But he could also be a disciplinarian, suspending two of the professionals for a couple of matches for misbehaviour and warning an amateur off for providing the professionals with duff horse-racing tips."]}, {"page": "Frederick Pratten (cricketer)", "response": ["A wicketkeeper and tail-end batsman, Pratten was one of several substitute wicketkeepers used by Somerset to cover the absence through ill-health of the regular wicketkeeper, Wally Luckes.

Wisden said he was \"far and away the best all-rounder in the side\". His aggregate of runs increased to 1465 and his average to 31.17, and there were three centuries, as many as he had made in his career before the season began. In Somerset's first home match of the season, against Kent at Taunton, he carried his bat for 135 out of a Somerset total of 352, an innings described by Wisden as \"watchful\" and that featured a 10th wicket partnership with wicket-keeper Wally Luckes of 112. Later in the season he shared century opening partnerships with his brother Frank in three consecutive matches, who also enjoyed his most successful season so far. Wisden noted: \"Between them, they made seven of the eleven individual centuries registered for the county... It cannot be said that they were, as a rule, attractive to watch, but extra care could be excused in view of the knowledge that failure on their part probably\u2014and usually\u2014meant the cheap dismissal of the side.\" As a bowler, he took 77 wickets at an average of 28.74, and was Somerset's leading wicket-taker. In the match against Essex at Colchester, he achieved his best innings and match bowling figures, his five for 75 in the first Essex innings being followed by seven for 45 in the second \u2013 though Somerset still managed to lose the game."]}, {"page": "Box Case", "response": ["Case was a right-handed middle-order batsman whose batting technique, in one account, was \"limited and effective\". He also kept wicket very occasionally in the period at the end of the 1920s and into the 1930s when regular Somerset wicket-keeper Wally Luckes was ill. Although the Somerset side in Case's time often contained amateur players who appeared in relatively few matches, Case was virtually a regular, appearing in 255 matches for the county in 11 seasons, plus two for the Gentlemen in Gentlemen v Players games in 1931 and 1934."]}, {"page": "Laurie Hawkins", "response": ["Hawkins made a promising start to county cricket, hitting 65 in his first innings in the match against Nottinghamshire at Taunton in 1928 and sharing in a ninth wicket stand of 89 in 90 minutes with Wally Luckes.

Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that Somerset used seven different wicketkeepers during the 1929 season, including Wilde and Luckes."]}, {"page": "Trevor Jones (cricketer)", "response": ["In the match against Leicestershire at Leicester, Jones batted at No 9 as Somerset made 190 in the first innings, to which Leicestershire replied with 358 to lead by 168 on first innings. When Jones went in, again at No 9, in Somerset's second innings, the score was 123 for seven wickets, still 45 behind. A further wicket fell early on the last morning of the match with the score at 140, still needing 28 to make Leicestershire bat again. But Jones and the wicketkeeper Wally Luckes then put on a partnership of 146 for the ninth wicket, and when Jones was out for 106, Luckes then went on to add a further 70 runs for the last wicket with Horace Hazell, enabling Somerset to save the game. The ninth wicket partnership of 146 was a record for Somerset in first-class cricket at the time, though it has been overtaken since. At 18 years and 104 days, Jones was the youngest century-maker in Somerset's history, and though there were few other runs for Jones in the 1938 season, Wisden noted in its 1939 edition that \"if able to spare the time he should, with greater experience, develop into a first-class batsman\"."]}, {"page": "Alan Marshall (cricketer)", "response": ["Marshall was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm slow bowler for most of his first-class cricket career, but in the last three seasons in which he played, from 1929 to 1931, he also acted at times as Somerset's wicketkeeper because of the long-running ill-health of the county's regular keeper, Wally Luckes."]}, {"page": "Mervyn Hill", "response": ["The Indian tour marked virtually the end of Hill's cricket career.

His highest score came in one of only three home games he played in his Somerset career: against Kent at Bath he batted at No 10 and made 46, putting on 93 with Wally Luckes, who made his maiden century, 121 not out. His only bowling \"success\" came in his second match in 1936, when he took three wickets for 81 runs in the match against Surrey at The Oval; the success was relative, however, as Surrey amassed a total of 512 in a day and won the match by an innings."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 828 || Wally Luckes", "| 365 || Wally Luckes || 1924-1949"]}, {"page": "James Priddy", "response": ["Priddy was a lower-order batsman and a bowler, though neither his batting style nor his bowling style are known.
