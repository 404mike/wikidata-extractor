Church authorities did not indicate any connection between that investigation and the news that Western Australian Police had been investigating an allegation made of sexual misconduct made against him 18 months earlier. Peter Ingham, Bishop emeritus of Wollongong, has been tasked with the Church's investigation into Saunder's management, including financial affairs and handling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests. The Church had received complaints about Saunders as early as April 2019 and tried to evaluate them while preventing their repetition and without alerting Saunders. On 27 November 2020, Saunders agreed to take a six-months leave \"outside the Diocese\", where his continued performance in public as a priest has provoked complaints."]}, {"page": "Ingham, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Ingham"]}]}}
