In the end, the judges' vote was split between Banville and Ishiguro, with Rick Gekoski one of those favouring Banville. It fell to Sutherland to cast the winning vote; he did so in favour of Banville. Banville later said: \"I have not been the most popular person in London literary circles over the past half-year.

The nominees for the fourth Man Booker International Prize were announced on 30 March 2011 at a ceremony in Sydney, Australia. John le Carr\u00e9 asked to be removed from consideration, saying he was \"flattered\", but that he does not compete for literary prizes. However, judge Dr Rick Gekoski said although he was disappointed that le Carr\u00e9 wanted to withdraw, his name would remain on the list. American novelist Roth was announced as the winner on 18 May 2011 at the Sydney Writers' Festival. Of his win, Roth said \"This is a great honour and I'm delighted to receive it.\" The writer said he hoped the prize would bring him to the attention of readers around the world who are not currently familiar with his body of work. Roth received his award in London on 28 June; however, he was unable to attend in person due to ill health, so he sent a short video instead. After Roth was announced as the winner, Carmen Callil withdrew from the judging panel, saying \"I don't rate him as a writer at all... in 20 years' time will anyone read him?\" Callil later wrote an editorial in The Guardian explaining her position and why she chose to leave the panel."]}, {"page": "Guido Adler", "response": ["After the Anschluss in 1938, Adler was forced to resign from his position as editor of Denkm\u00e4ler der Tonkunst in \u00d6sterreich.
