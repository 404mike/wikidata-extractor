The EP showcases Senni's viewpoint as a \"Rave Voyeur\" character (as showed on its cover art by Ed Atkins) of the music and culture of hard trance, as well as the genre's relations to dancehall and the rest of the electronic music dance spectrum. Persona differed from Senni's past trance releases in terms of composition and production; he was influenced by hardcore punk to have the EP consist more on chords rather than arpeggios, and the recordings of the Roland JP-8000 Supersaw sounds he used were edited and altered with effects instead of just left raw, leading to a much more expressive scope in terms of sound according to critic Patric Fallon. The album garnered very favorable reviews from music journalists upon its release, landing at the number four spot of Fact magazine's list of the best albums of 2016.", "The cover art for Persona is a screenshot of a video by British video artist Ed Atkins, and depicts an androgynous human who looks through a hole, \"interested to the point of making [their] nose touch the wall \u2013 but not too much.\" This is a representation of Senni's character as a \"Rave Voyeur,\" or stranger of the dance music scene, that he was having in the previous six years of his music career.
