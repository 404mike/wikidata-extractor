A committed Marxist from 1931, he joined the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939), then was recruited by the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, and was sent to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945). There he met and married his wife, Isabel, a teacher and social activist. Following the Second World War and the Chinese Civil War, the couple stayed in China and taught English.In 1959, the Crooks published Revolution in a Chinese Village, Ten Mile Inn and in 1966 came The First Years of Yangyi Commune. The British Sinologist Delia Davin wrote that through that \"classic study\" and other writings and talks, the Crooks \"provided a positive picture of China to the outside world at a time when cold war simplifications were the norm.\" The Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist) called Revolution a \"seminal work, which has been bringing the achievements and challenges of the Chinese agrarian revolution to life for English-speaking readers since 1959.\" Crook died at 90 after spending his last five decades in China, his political beliefs largely unshaken despite five years' imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ram\u00f3n Mercader", "response": ["Mercader's contacts with and befriending of Trotskyists began during the Spanish Civil War.
