The first cost is that in sexually dimorphic species only one of the two sexes can bear young. This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many invertebrates. The second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes. Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms. The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever-changing environment.  Another hypothesis is that sexual reproduction is primarily an adaptation for promoting accurate recombinational repair of damage in germline DNA, and that increased diversity is a byproduct of this process that may sometimes be adaptively beneficial.Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE.

The 1972 essay is sometimes cited instead of the 1973 paper, but university libraries are much more likely to have copies of Nature. Papers in Nature are usually short; in 1974, Maynard Smith published a longer paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Maynard Smith explains further in his 1982 book Evolution and the Theory of Games. Sometimes these are cited instead.

John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of evolutionary game theory.", "In the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in biology, largely as a result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy.

The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by John Maynard Smith in his 1982 book Evolution and the Theory of Games.", "Some game theorists, following the work of John Maynard Smith and George R. Price, have turned to evolutionary game theory in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or bounded rationality on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume natural selection in the biological sense.

He suggests that creationists \"don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public.\" In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that \"among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know.\" When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word theory, Dawkins stated that \"evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening.\" He added that \"it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course.

Maynard Smith thought that Gould misjudged the vital role of adaptation in biology, and was critical of Gould's acceptance of species selection as a major component of biological evolution.Maynard Smith, John (1981). \"Did Darwin get it right?\" The London Review of Books 3 (11): 10\u201311; Also reprinted in Did Darwin Get it Right?

D. Hamilton, Robert Trivers, John Maynard Smith, and George R. Price. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when \"biology in the field\" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by \"modern\" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology)."]}, {"page": "Speciation", "response": ["Evolution is imposed on species or groups. It is not planned or striven for in some Lamarckist way. The mutations on which the process depends are random events, and, except for the \"silent mutations\" which do not affect the functionality or appearance of the carrier, are thus usually disadvantageous, and their chance of proving to be useful in the future is vanishingly small. Therefore, while a species or group might benefit from being able to adapt to a new environment by accumulating a wide range of genetic variation, this is to the detriment of the individuals who have to carry these mutations until a small, unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation. Thus, the capability to evolve would require group selection, a concept discredited by (for example) George C. Williams, John Maynard Smith and Richard Dawkins \"Remarks on an earlier article by [Elliot] Sober [sic] and David Sloan Wilson, who made a more extended argument in their recent book Unto Others : The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior\" \"Commentary on Wilson & Sober: Group Selection.\" as selectively disadvantageous to the individual."]}, {"page": "The Evolution of Cooperation", "response": ["When Richard Dawkins set out to \"examine the biology of selfishness and altruism\" in The Selfish Gene, he reinterpreted the basis of evolution, and therefore of altruism. He was \"not advocating a morality based on evolution\",, pp. 1 and 2. and even felt that \"we must teach our children altruism, for we cannot expect it to be part of their biological nature.\". But John Maynard Smith was showing that behavior could be subject to evolution, Robert Trivers had shown that reciprocal altruism is strongly favored by natural selection to lead to complex systems of altruistic behavior (supporting Kropotkin's argument that cooperation is as much a factor of evolution as competition. Why Kropotkin did not prevail is interesting \u2013 see Stephen Jay Gould's article \"Kropotkin was no crackpot\"  \u2013 but beyond the scope of this article.), and Axelrod's dramatic results showed that in a very simple game the conditions for survival (be \"nice\", be provocable, promote the mutual interest) seem to be the essence of morality. While this does not yet amount to a science of morality, the game theoretic approach has clarified the conditions required for the evolution and persistence of cooperation, and shown how Darwinian natural selection can lead to complex behavior, including notions of morality, fairness, and justice. It is shown that the nature of self-interest is more profound than previously considered, and that behavior that seems altruistic may, in a broader view, be individually beneficial. Extensions of this work to morality. and the social contract;  may yet resolve the old issue of individual interests versus group interests."]}, {"page": "Theoretical ecology", "response": ["followed closely by John Maynard Smith, who in his seminal 1972 paper, \u201cGame Theory and the Evolution of Fighting\", defined the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy."]}, {"page": "University of Sussex", "response": ["Academically, Sussex was home to figures such as Asa Lord Briggs, Helmut Pappe, Gillian Rose, Jennifer Platt and Tom Bottomore.
