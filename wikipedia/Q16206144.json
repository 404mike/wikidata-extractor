In the 1980s the influential rock band Spacemen 3 was formed in Rugby by the local musicians Jason Pierce and Pete Kember. Following its demise in 1991, both musicians went on to form successful subsequent projects; Pierce formed the critically acclaimed band Spiritualized and Kember continued performing under the names Sonic Boom/Spectrum. Other notable musical acts to emerge from Rugby include the 1970s pop band Jigsaw which was formed by musicians from Rugby and Coventry, the 2000s singer-songwriter James Morrison, and more recently Emily Burns.", "*Emily Burns (born 1994), singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "Rugby High School for Girls", "response": ["* Emily Burns, singer"]}, {"page": "List of Island Records artists", "response": ["* Emily Burns"]}, {"page": "Victorious Festival", "response": ["|The Kooks, Feeder, Peter Hook and The Light, Terrorvision, Lottery Winners, Rag'n'Bone Man, Craig David, Blossoms, The Fratellis, Frank Turner, Morcheeba, Reef, The Lathums, Stereo MC's, Black Honey, Seth Lakeman, Porridge Radio, Bad Sounds, Bloxx, The Mysterines, Wild Front, Rews, Lauran Hibberd, Emily Burns, Andrew Cushin, Me and The Moon, Supergrass, Fontaines D.C., Annie Mac, Miles Kane, Ella Eyre, Melanie C, Jade Bird, Clean Bandit, Cast, Glasvegas, The Snuts, Jaguar Skills, Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs, Beans on Toast, Kawala, Lily Moore, Billie Marten, Fenne Lily, Liz Lawrence, The Clockworks, Louis Berry, Nia Wyn, Roxanne De Bastion"]}, {"page": "Longitude Festival", "response": ["Emily Burns"]}, {"page": "Mark Ralph production discography", "response": ["| Emily Burns || My Town EP || \"My Town\" || ", "| Emily Burns || rowspan=\"2\"  || \"Is It Just Me?\"  || "]}]}}
