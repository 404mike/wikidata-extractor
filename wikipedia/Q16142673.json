In 1989, Diana was at a birthday party for Camilla's sister, Annabel Elliot, when she confronted Camilla about her and Charles's extramarital affair. These affairs were later exposed in May 1992 with the publication of Andrew Morton's book, Diana: Her True Story. The book, which also revealed Diana's allegedly suicidal unhappiness, caused a media storm. In 1991, James Colthurst had conducted secret interviews with Diana in which she had talked about her marital issues and difficulties. These recordings were later used as a source for Morton's book."]}, {"page": "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall", "response": ["Camilla Rosemary Shand was born at King's College Hospital, London, on 17 July 1947.Graham, p. 9Some sources report that she was born in Plumpton, but it seems that this is a confusion of her childhood home with her birthplace.
