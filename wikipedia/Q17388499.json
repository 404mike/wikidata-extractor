Dr S. D. Jouhar said, when he formed the Photographic Fine Art Association at that time: \"At the moment photography is not generally recognized as anything more than a craft. In the USA photography has been openly accepted as Fine Art in certain official quarters. It is shown in galleries and exhibitions as an Art. There is not corresponding recognition in this country. The London Salon shows pictorial photography, but it is not generally understood as an art. Whether a work shows aesthetic qualities or not it is designated 'Pictorial Photography' which is a very ambiguous term. The photographer himself must have confidence in his work and in its dignity and aesthetic value, to force recognition as an Art rather than a Craft\"."]}, {"page": "Royal Photographic Society", "response": ["The Tyng Collection, part of the RPS Collection and now at the V&A Museum, is a collection of outstanding pictorial photography started in 1927 by an American philanthropist and society member, Stephen H. Tyng. He established a foundation to promote and recognise photographic work of outstanding pictorial merit. The first colour print to be accepted into the Tyng Collection, in 1960, was \"Madrasi Fishermen\" taken by Dr S. D. Jouhar during his six-month trip to India in 1959.Photographic Society of America Journal, Vol. 29, No. 4, April 1963, p. 12."]}]}}
