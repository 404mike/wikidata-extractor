He co-founded the Wicked Sound System and established a series of  underground parties which were important in putting San Francisco on the club/rave map.\nBorn and raised in England, Garth moved to San Francisco in 1990 and became a key player in the city's dance scene. In 1991 along with friends and fellow DJs Jen\u00f6, Thomas Bullock and Markie, he founded the Wicked Sound System, and organized the monthly Full Moon events that led to increased underground interest in rave culture. By 1994 the crew imported a custom Tony Andrews-designed Turbosound system, teaming up with a 1947 Greyhound bus which allowed the Wicked act to tour the States.\nThis annual tour along with early appearances at Burning Man and Reggae on the River Festivals gave Garth the inspiration to produce his own music. Wicked Records' first (and most successful) release was DJ Garth's 1996 collaboration with E.T.I., \"20 Minutes of Disco Glory,\" which remains a popular House track. It was featured in the soundtrack for the movie Groove.\nIn 1998, Garth founded his own label Grayhound Recordings, named after the Wicked tour bus. Grayhound became the home label for his own projects including singles with Markie and as Rocket with Eric James. The label went on to release 54 singles from California recording artists including DJ Garth & E.T.I., Rocket, Defenders of the Faith, Wicked, Mirror Boys, DJ Harvey, Nectar, Stranger, Rasoul, EBE & Michoacan.\n1998 proved to be a milestone year, with the release of Thrive's popular mix CD U.S. Underground, Vol. 1. 2000 saw the release of The Cisco System, a Garth mix CD showcasing the work of Grayhound artists.  This was the first of three Grayhound mixes, the others being Revolutions in Sound & Unleash the Hound. In 2001, Om released San Francisco Sessions Vol. 3, showcasing his blend of House and Dub. In 2003, UK label NRK released Garth's Nitelife Vol 7.\nGarth has remixed A Tribe Called Quest, Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, Faithless, Yabby You, The Units, The Glimmers, DadaMunchamonkey, Adam Freeland, Strafe and many others.\nWicked Sound System are still going strong as they approach thirty years as a DJ crew.\nIn 2007 he launched Golden Goose re-edits with James Glass to release their own King & Hound edits. The purpose of the label lies in reviving forgotten Disco and Synth Rock tracks.\nMoving to Los Angeles in 2011 made his big screen debut as an actor (credited as Garth Wynne-Jones) in the feature film Speed Dragon which premiered at Cannes Film Festival and won Best Feature at NY Independent Film Festival. He has built up many on-camera and voice-over credits in film since and maintains a busy tour schedule DJing around the world. In 2010 he toured extensively in Japan & Australia with DJ Harvey.\nGarth stays true to the original art form playing strictly all vinyl sets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Units", "response": ["In 2005, Ryser signed a licensing contract with EMI.

Ames left the group permanently after the release of their first single."]}, {"page": "Culture of San Francisco", "response": ["San Francisco has often hosted influential rock music trends, starting with the San Francisco Sound during the 1960s. Two of the most influential bands from that era, the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, started out in San Francisco in 1965. Other groups include rockers Creedence Clearwater Revival, Santana, soft rock band Pablo Cruise and Journey, seminal punk band the Dead Kennedys, and alternative metal band Faith No More. It is the birthplace of thrash metal with bands such as Metallica, Testament, Exodus, Slayer, Death Angel, Megadeth and latterly Machine Head. San Francisco has had significant influence on punk rock in California since the late 1970s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s it was somewhat influential in rave and electronica. Activity in the Goth/industrial scene has been continuous in the city since then, with it being home to the world's second longest running goth club after Slimelight in London, England. Gentrification during the late 1990s is said to have forced many performers to move away. However, San Francisco is still home to a number of respected music acts, such as Chuck Prophet, Lords of Sealand and John Vanderslice, and especially in the Fillmore and Hunters Point districts, San Francisco is the home of numerous rappers, including Messy Marv, RBL Posse, Rappin' 4-Tay, HughEMC, San Quinn, Andre Nickatina, Big Rich, JT the Bigga Figga, Ant Rich 415, and Paris. San Francisco DJs and electronic musicians are credited with defining the laid-back, dub-influenced sound of the West Coast house music. Prominent DJs and artists include Kaskade, Miguel Migs, Mark Farina, and DJ Garth. Dub Mission is among the city's regular music parties. Since 2000 San Francisco has hosted the How Weird Street Faire, claimed to be the longest-running electronic music street festival in North America."]}, {"page": "Om Records", "response": ["*DJ Garth"]}, {"page": "Dj garth", "response": ["#REDIRECT DJ Garth "]}, {"page": "Dj Garth", "response": ["#REDIRECT DJ Garth "]}, {"page": "Thomas Bullock (musician)", "response": ["In the late 1980s Bullock joined the group Tonka, alongside DJ Harvey.

Their deep, psychedelic techno breakbeats were a perfect compliment to what we were doing at the time \u2026 truly a visionary label.\u201dKCRW DJ Jason Bentley says of the labels releases:\"Tom Chasteen and Mike Kandel were way ahead of their time. As far as independent dance labels and a uniquely psychedelic dance sound, it was one of the earliest links from a '60s/'70s rock aesthetic to the burgeoning dance music scene in the early '90s. They had no rule book or template. The different things they were releasing ranged in style and tempo. I think the intent just had to be sacred and transformative.\u201dMany of the artists who released on the label were aliases for the founders' themselves. While their releases did not top the charts, they were popular among DJs playing the emerging sounds of trance, ambient house, breakbeat, and techno around the world.  "]}]}}
