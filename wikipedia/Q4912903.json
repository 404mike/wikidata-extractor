They did, however, venture into the transfer market signing centre-forward Vic Watson from Kay's former club West Ham United. The team made a superb start to the season with four wins and two draws in the first six games and by the end of September Saints were top of the table. Once again, this form could not be sustained, and only three further games were won before the new year. The slump continued into 1936 being partly relieved by a 7\u20132 victory over Nottingham Forest on 15 February. On 28 March Saints suffered their heaviest-ever league defeat, going down 8\u20130 away to Tottenham Hotspur and two days later had their lowest ever home attendance for a league match, when only 1,875 turned out on a Monday night to witness a 1\u20130 defeat against Port Vale. Predictably, the directors responded by selling their better players, with goalkeeper Billy Light (another product of the nursery side) being sold to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a32,000. Once again Saints finished the season in a disappointing 17th position, with Watson top-scorer on 14 goals."]}, {"page": "Bill Light (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Light"]}, {"page": "Light (surname)", "response": ["*Bill Light and Billy Light - see William Light (disambiguation), several people:", ":*Billy Light (William Henry \"Billy\" Light, 1913\u20131993), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1945\u201346 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Light"]}, {"page": "1939\u201340 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Light||GK||||Woolston||||42||0|| West Bromwich Albion||17 June 1938||\u00a31,500", "|align=\"left\"|Billy Light"]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Light||GK||||Woolston||||0||0|| West Bromwich Albion||17 June 1938||\u00a31,500", "|Billy Light", "|align=\"left\"|Billy Light", "|Billy Light"]}, {"page": "William Light (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Billy Light (William Henry \"Billy\" Light, 1913\u20131993), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Bert Scriven", "response": ["He made his first-team debut when he took over from the veteran Willie White for the fourth match of the 1930\u201331 Second Division season on 8 September 1930, a 2\u20131 defeat at Oldham Athletic. Scriven soon became established as first-choice goalkeeper although he lost his place to White for the last eight matches of the season. White retained the No. 1 shirt for the first seven matches of the following season, before Scriven claimed it back in September 1931. From then on, Scriven rarely missed a match over the next two and a half years until February 1934 when manager George Kay replaced him with the 20-year-old Billy Light.
