Luttrell Byrom petitioned for divorce in 1915 citing one G. Henderson as a co-respondent. Her second marriage was at Edinburgh on 26 January 1917, to Sir Roger Thomas Twysden, a naval officer. He had succeeded as tenth Baronet on 1 May 1911, so Duff became known as Lady Twysden. Their son Anthony, later eleventh Baronet, was born on 11 March 1918.Sir Roger and Lady Twysden were divorced in 1926. Duff Twysden eventually married artist Clinton King. She died in Santa Fe, New Mexico of tuberculosis when she was forty-seven.Twysden was famous for adopting a boyish, androgenous fashion style, with a bobbed haircut and workingmen's clothes, before this was fashionable. She was also sexually adventurous without apology at a time when this was scandalous.\nIn the 1988 miniseries Hemingway, starring Stacy Keach, Duff Twysden was played by Fiona Fullerton.", "link_mentions": {}}}
