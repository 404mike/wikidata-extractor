Some of these terms deal with the different elements and features of the mind and are drawn from classic Buddhist thought. The generic term for consciousness is shes pa (Skt. vij\u00f1\u0101na), and includes the six sense consciousnesses. Worldly, impure and dualistic forms of consciousness are generally referred to with terms such as sems (citta, mind),  yid (m\u0101nas) and blo (buddhi). On the other hand, nirvanic or liberated forms of consciousness are described with terms such as ye shes (j\u00f1\u0101na, 'pristine consciousness') and shes rab (praj\u00f1\u0101, wisdom).  According to Sam van Schaik, two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the ground (gzhi) and gnosis (rig pa), which represent the \"ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state\" respectively.", " According to Sam van Schaik, Jigme Lingpa's system of practice \"represents both a graduated method and a gradual realization\" which \"stands in stark contrast to the discourse of the Great Perfection treasure texts,\" which defend a much more simultaneous form of practice."]}, {"page": "Kizil Caves", "response": ["According to a recent translation by Sam van Schaik, the text should be:", "According to Sam van Schaik, \"Mendre\" could be the Indo-Greek king Menander, or the mythical king Manadhat\u1e5b of Buddhist sources; \"Polosi\" could be a Chinese abbreviation for king Prasenajit; \"Romakam\" may be the Byzantine Empire; the \"naked ones\" would be the Niganthas."]}, {"page": "Rim\u00e9 movement", "response": ["The Rim\u00e9 movement is a movement or tendency in Tibetan Buddhism which promotes non-sectarianism and universalism.Sam van Schaik (2011).

On 7 February 1959, a significant day on the Tibetan calendar, the Dalai Lama attended a religious dance, after which the acting representative in Tibet, Tan Guansan, offered the Dalai Lama a chance to see a performance from a dance troupe native to Lhasa at the Norbulingka to celebrate the Dalai Lama's completion of his lharampa geshe degree. According to the Dalai Lama's memoirs, the invitation came from Chinese General Chiang Chin-wu, who proposed that the performance be held at the Chinese military headquarters; the Dalai Lama states that he agreed.Dalai Lama's (1990) Freedom in Exile states that \"General Chiang Chin-wu... announced... a new dance troupe... Might I be interested to see them? I replied that I would be. He then said that they could perform anywhere, but since there was a proper stage with footlights at the Chinese military headquarters, it might be better if I could go there. This made sense as there were no such facilities at the Norbulingka, so I indicated that I would be happy to do so\" (p. 130) However, tibetologist Sam van Schaik stated that the Dalai Lama was the one who proposed that the dance should take place in the military headquarters as the Norbulingka was too small. Both parties did not yet agree on a date, and the Dalai Lama seemed to put the event \"out of his mind\", focusing instead on his ongoing examinations for his Geshe degree as well as the Monlam Prayer Festival."]}, {"page": "Van Schaik", "response": ["*Sam van Schaik (born 1972), English Tibetologist"]}, {"page": "Ground (Dzogchen)", "response": ["*Nature (Tib. \u0f62\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f56\u0f5e\u0f72\u0f53\u0f0b, rangshyin; Wyl. rang bzhin, Skt. prak\u1e5bti) is defined as \"Natural Perfection\" (Tib. lhun grub, Skt. an\u0101bhoga), also translated \"spontaneous presence\" or \"spontaneous accomplishment\". This is the noetic potentiality of the basis. According to Norbu, this aspect refers to the continuous manifestation or appearance of phenomena and can be illustrated by comparing it to a \"mirror's capacity to reflect.\" Sam van Schaik explains this as \"a presence that is spontaneous in that it is not created or based on anything\" as well as \"the luminous aspect of the ground\". Natural Perfection is also used interchangeably with the aspect of \"luminosity\" ('od gsal, Skt. prabh\u0101svara). The Nature of the basis is also associated with the Dharma and the Sa\u1e43bhogak\u0101ya. Longchenpa explains that there are \"eight gateways of spontaneous presence\". According to Hatchell the first six gateways are \"the essential forms that awareness takes when it first manifests: lights, Buddha-bodies, gnosis, compassion, freedom, and nonduality,\" while the final two gateways \"are viewpoints from which the first six are perceived\" and are the gateways to purity (i.e. nirvana) and impurity (samsara) which are associated with self-recognition/integration and non-recognition/duality (also called \"straying\", 'khrul pa).", "*Compassion (Tib. \u0f50\u0f74\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f97\u0f7a\u0f0b, tukj\u00e9, Wyl. thugs rje, Skt. karu\u1e47\u0101), also sometimes translated as \"Energy\". It is also called the \"manifest ground\" (gzhi snang) or the \"ground of arising\" ('char gzhi). Norbu compares this manifest aspect of the basis to the particular appearances that are reflected in a mirror. This aspect is also defined in the Illuminating Lamp as: \"Thugs is the affection (brtse ba) in the heart for sentient beings. Rje is the arising of a special empathy (gdung sems) for them.\" Smith explains this aspect as referring to the unity of clarity and emptiness. Clarity (Tib. gsal ba, Skt. svara) is a term which is also found in Indian Mahayana and refers to the cognitive power of the mind that allows phenomena to appear.  According to Sam van Schaik this aspect \"seems to signify the immanent presence of the ground in all appearance, in that it is defined as all-encompassing and unobstructed.\" Compassion is associated with the Nirmanakaya and the Sangha.
