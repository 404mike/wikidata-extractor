He has written and produced as of 2021, more than eighty full-length plays in Scarborough and London and was, between 1972 and 2009, the artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, where all but four of his plays have received their first performance. More than 40 have subsequently been produced in the West End, at the Royal National Theatre or by the Royal Shakespeare Company since his first hit Relatively Speaking opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1969.\nMajor successes include Absurd Person Singular (1975), The Norman Conquests trilogy (1973), Bedroom Farce (1975), Just Between Ourselves (1976), A Chorus of Disapproval (1984), Woman in Mind (1985), A Small Family Business (1987), Man of the Moment (1988), House & Garden (1999) and Private Fears in Public Places (2004). His plays have won numerous awards, including seven London Evening Standard Awards. They have been translated into over 35 languages and are performed on stage and television throughout the world. Ten of his plays have been staged on Broadway, attracting two Tony nominations, and one Tony award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 12", "response": ["*1939 \u2013 Alan Ayckbourn, English director and playwright"]}, {"page": "Alan Ayckbourn/Plays", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Ayckbourn"]}, {"page": "George Bernard Shaw", "response": ["Crawford lists numerous playwrights whose work owes something to that of Shaw. Among those active in Shaw's lifetime he includes No\u00ebl Coward, who based his early comedy The Young Idea on You Never Can Tell and continued to draw on the older man's works in later plays. T. S. Eliot, by no means an admirer of Shaw, admitted that the epilogue of Murder in the Cathedral, in which Becket's slayers explain their actions to the audience, might have been influenced by Saint Joan. The critic Eric Bentley comments that Eliot's later play The Confidential Clerk \"had all the earmarks of Shavianism\u00a0... without the merits of the real Bernard Shaw\". Among more recent British dramatists, Crawford marks Tom Stoppard as \"the most Shavian of contemporary playwrights\"; Shaw's \"serious farce\" is continued in the works of Stoppard's contemporaries Alan Ayckbourn, Henry Livings and Peter Nichols."]}, {"page": "Othello", "response": ["When Laurence Olivier gave his acclaimed performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre in 1964, he had developed a case of stage fright that was so profound that when he was alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves.Laurence Olivier, Confessions of an Actor, Simon and Schuster (1982) p. 262 This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film \u2013 Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards. Olivier was among the last white actors to be greatly acclaimed as Othello, although the role continued to be played by such performers as Donald Sinden at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979\u20131980, Paul Scofield at the Royal National Theatre in 1980, Anthony Hopkins in the BBC Television Shakespeare production (1981), and Michael Gambon in a stage production at Scarborough directed by Alan Ayckbourn in 1990. Gambon had been in Olivier's earlier production. In an interview Gambon commented \"I wasn't even the second gentleman in that. I didn't have any lines at all. I was at the back like that, standing for an hour. [It's] what I used to do \u2013 I had a metal helmet, I had an earplug, and we used to listen to The Archers. No one knew. All the line used to listen to The Archers. And then I went and played Othello myself at Birmingham Rep I was 27. Olivier sent me a telegram on the first night. He said, \"Copy me.\" He said, \"Do what I used to do.\" Olivier used to lower his voice for Othello so I did mine. He used to paint the big negro lips on. You couldn't do it today, you'd get shot. He had the complete negro face. And the hips. I did all that. I copied him exactly. Except I had a pony tail. I played him as an Arab. I stuck a pony tail on with a bell on the end of it. I thought that would be nice.

British blacking-up for Othello ended with Gambon in 1990; however the Royal Shakespeare Company didn't run the play at all on the main Stratford stage until 1999, when Ray Fearon became the first black British actor to take the part, the first black man to play Othello with the RSC since Robeson."]}, {"page": "1939", "response": ["* April 12 \u2013 Alan Ayckbourn, English dramatist"]}, {"page": "Gillian Anderson", "response": ["Anderson moved to New York when she was 22 years old, and worked as a waitress to support herself.

The planned follow-up to Jesus Christ Superstar was a musical comedy based on the Jeeves and Wooster novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.(Rice, 1999) Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical Jeeves with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics.Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997). p. 82, Abrams: New York Jeeves failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975.

This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song.", "There are many references to the theatre throughout Resnais's filmmaking (Marienbad, Muriel, Stavisky, Mon oncle d'Am\u00e9rique), but he first undertook the challenge of taking a complete stage work and giving it new cinematic life in M\u00e9lo (1986), an adaptation of Henri Bernstein's 1929 play of the same name. Resnais remained entirely faithful to the play (apart from shortening it) and he emphasised its theatricality by filming in long takes on large sets of evidently artificial design, as well as by marking off the acts of the play with the fall of a curtain.Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais: arpenteur de l'imagination. (Paris: Ramsay, 2008.) pp.206\u2013207. After an excursion into the world of comic books and cartoons in I Want to Go Home (1989), an ambitious theatrical adaptation followed with the diptych of Smoking/No Smoking (1993). Resnais, having admired the plays of Alan Ayckbourn for many years, chose to adapt what appeared the most intractable of them, Intimate Exchanges, a series of eight interlinked plays which follow the consequences of a casual choice to sixteen possible endings. Resnais slightly reduced the number of permuted endings and compressed the plays into two films, each having a common starting point, and to be seen in any order. Sabine Az\u00e9ma and Pierre Arditi played all the parts, and the theatricality of the undertaking was again emphasised by the studio set designs for a fictional English village.Interview with Resnais (by Fran\u00e7ois Thomas) in Positif, no.394, d\u00e9c. 1993; reprinted in Alain Resnais: anthologie \u00e9tablie par St\u00e9phane Goudet. (Paris: Gallimard, 2002.) pp.405\u2013406, 409\u2013410. Resnais returned to Ayckbourn in the following decade for his adaptation of Private Fears in Public Places to which he gave the film title of C\u0153urs (2006). Among the stage/film effects which contribute to its mood of \"cheerful desolation\" is the artificial snow which is continually seen through set windows until eventually it falls on the studio interior as well.Dave Kehr, \"Restless Innovations from Alain Resnais\", in The New York Times, 8 April 2007: \"As Mr. Resnais told a French interviewer, the effect he is after is one of 'd\u00e9solation all\u00e8gre,' a blithe, jaunty despair.\"", "In his final two films, Resnais again drew his source material from the theatre. Vous n'avez encore rien vu (You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet!, 2012) was adapted from two plays by Jean Anouilh, and it assembled thirteen actors (many of them regular performers in Resnais's earlier films) who have been summoned by the dying wish of an author to witness a new performance their roles in one of his plays.Jean-Luc Douin, Alain Resnais.

The film was shown in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.  Aimer, boire et chanter (2014) was the third film which Resnais adapted from a play by Alan Ayckbourn, in this case Life of Riley, in which three couples are thrown into confusion by the news that a shared friend has a terminal illness. Three weeks before Resnais's death, the film received its premiere in the competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014, where it won a Silver Bear award \"for a feature film that opens new perspectives\". At the time of his death, Resnais was preparing a further Ayckbourn project, based on the 2013 play Arrivals & Departures.Marie-No\u00eblle Tranchant. \"Alain Resnais, prodige du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais, est mort\", in Le Figaro, 3 mars 2014.
