In 1979, Hodge made a cameo appearance in the TV film ELVIS starring Kurt Russell in which he played himself and served as a technical adviser for the project. From the early 1980's to 1993 Hodge discovered, lived, and toured globally with actor and impressionist Gary Wayne Bridges and co-produced the touring creation 'For the Love of Elvis\" along with J.D. Sumner, and many of the original cast of Presley's group endorsing 20 year old Bridges as what they called at the time, the most authentic vocal double of Presley himself. Working with his then manager for both him and Bridges, Lewis Victor, Hodge co-produced and performed on two albums with Bridges featuring post non-Presley music of the day that Presley could have recorded as covers that sold over two million copies through national DRTV campaigns throughout North America. Upon Bridges leaving the Elvis World and becoming a producer in Nashville and Las Vegas, he was able to facilitate a meeting in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee with Dee Gallon, and her brother Michael J. Ferraro, co-owners at that time of the Memories Theater that yielded a potential wonderful opportunity for Hodge to perform live for the fans for many years to come. During the last 15 years of his life, Hodge became a featured performer at the Memories Theater in \"A Salute to Elvis\" with a select group of some of the world's greatest ETA's and close friends William Stiles, Pete Wilcox, Eddie Miles, and Lou Vuto. While at Memories Theatre, Hodge performed some of the same duties he did while performing with Presley such as singing harmony, draping the scarves around the ETA's neck as he did with Presley, and played guitar, or if it was required for a certain song, he played the piano. Hodge traveled the world annually to speak at Elvis Presley events and to sometimes perform with longtime friend, singer and musician, Terry Mike Jeffery. Countries Hodge visited included England, Ireland, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Hungary, Australia, and Japan. In 1988, Hodge wrote an autobiography-memoir, Me 'n Elvis, and in 1994, produced a DVD titled The Elvis I Knew."]}, {"page": "Dean of Liverpool", "response": ["*15 September 2012Liverpool Cathedral \u2013 Pete Wilcox is next Dean Liverpool Cathedral \u2013 Installation of the Seventh Dean5 June 2017: Pete Wilcox (became Bishop of Sheffield)"]}, {"page": "Dean of Lichfield", "response": ["*March\u2013September 2012 Pete Wilcox, Acting Dean"]}]}}
