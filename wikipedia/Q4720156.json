He also worked on identifying comets as the source of meteor showers.

The Zeta Aurigids are a weak shower with a northern and southern branch lasting from December 11 to January 21. The shower peaks on January 1 and has very slow meteors, with a maximum rate of 1\u20135 meteors per hour. It was discovered by William Denning in 1886 and was discovered to be the source of rare fireballs by Alexander Stewart Herschel. There is another faint stream of meteors called the \"Aurigids\", unrelated to the September shower. This shower lasts from January 31 to February 23, peaking from February 5 through February 10; its slow meteors peak at a rate of approximately 2 per hour. The Delta Aurigids are a faint shower radiating from Auriga. It was discovered by a group of researchers at New Mexico State University and has a very low peak rate. The Delta Aurigids last from September 22 through October 23, peaking between October 6 and October 15. They may be related to the September Epsilon Perseids, though they are more similar to the Coma Berenicids in that the Delta Aurigids last longer and have a dearth of bright meteors. They too have a hypothesized connection to an unknown short period retrograde comet. The Iota Aurigids are a hypothesized shower occurring in mid-November; its parent body may be the asteroid 2000 NL10, but this connection is highly disputed. The hypothesized Iota Aurigids may instead be a faint stream of Taurids."]}, {"page": "1907 in science", "response": ["* June 18 \u2013 Alexander Stewart Herschel (born 1836), British astronomer."]}, {"page": "1836 in science", "response": ["* February 5 \u2013 Alexander Stewart Herschel (died 1907), South African-born British astronomer."]}, {"page": "List of Durham University people", "response": ["* Alexander Stewart Herschel FRS \u2013 first Professor of Physics at the College of Physical Sciences"]}, {"page": "Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["He was born in Slough in Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire), the third child (of twelve) and the eldest son (of three) of the astronomer, John Herschel.
