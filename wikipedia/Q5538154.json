Following Church's death in 1554, the building was again allowed to deteriorate until it was acquired by the borough council and converted for municipal use in 1576. Court hearings and civic meetings were transferred from the old moot hall in Silver Street at that time. The design of the new moot hall involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto the High street. On the ground floor there was a tetrastyle portico with Doric order columns supporting a heavily modillioned canopy: at the back of the portico were two doorways with fanlights and a blind central alcove. On the first floor there were two full-height round headed sash windows, one of which gave access to the balcony, and on the second floor, there was a single sash window. The building included a castellated tower containing a spiral staircase, which spiralled anti-clockwise, at its north east corner, as well as a small annexe, which contained a vaulted basement, at its northwest corner. A projecting clock, made by Dent & Co. and given to the town by the local member of parliament, George Courtauld, was installed on the front of the building in 1881; it was accompanied by a belfry, complete with bells, which was installed on the annexe roof at that time. An iron balustrade and a pair of lamps were also installed on the balcony in the late 19th century."]}]}}
