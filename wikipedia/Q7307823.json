During the 1955\u201356 season, Timmins was touted by press as the \"best full back outside the top flight\" and speculation grew that he would join teammate Reg Matthews in the England squad. Coventry turned down a substantial bid from Newcastle United for Timmins during his time at Highfield Road. He played a total of 165 games (161 in the Football League) and scored five goals before leaving Coventry to join Leamington in 1959, aged 37."]}, {"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["In January 1956 Coventry played a controversial match against the four-time Argentinian champions San Lorenzo de Almagro. San Lorenzo were touring Europe, including games in Spain, France, and Italy, as well as the UK, but were not used to the winter conditions and the routine deterioration of English pitches through the season at the time. They arrived in Coventry having lost all their games in the UK thus far, to Brentford, Rangers, Sheffield Wednesday, and Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves), the last featuring altercations with the referee. Trouble flared up again at Highfield Road, as Coventry were awarded a controversial penalty before half-time. San Lorenzo's Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo, a future Argentina international, reacted by kicking the referee, Arthur Ellis, and then refusing to leave the field when sent off. Ellis then called the game off. There was better news for Coventry later in the season as goalkeeper Reg Matthews was called up to the England national team and George Curtis, who would go on to become a Coventry legend as player and manager, made his debut at the age of 17. After the conclusion of the season, City appointed Harry Warren as the replacement permanent manager for Carver, the club's sixth in just five years.", "Warren's first season in charge was not a success, as once again a promising start was followed by a slump. Warren favoured a more physical style of play, rather than the continental system used by his predecessor. Raynor, who felt that he should have been given the managerial position full-time, left the club in November 1956 and then they lost star goalkeeper Reg Matthews, who was bought by Chelsea for \u00a322,000, a record fee for a goalkeeper at the time. Poor form and injury meant the club finished in 16th place, with gates down from 20,000 at the start of the season to just 5,000 by the end. 1957\u201358 proved even worse: Warren was dismissed in September following a poor start, to be replaced by Billy Frith, returning for a second spell in charge, but form did not improve and City finished 19th. The league was to be reorganised at the end of the season, an idea originally proposed by Coventry themselves, with the two regional third divisions replaced by a single nationwide third and a new fourth division. City were placed in the latter following their bottom-half finish, consigning them to their lowest tier of football since joining the Football League."]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. international footballers", "response": ["|Reg Matthews"]}, {"page": "Ray King (footballer)", "response": ["King made one international appearance for England 'B' on 22 May 1954 when he played the first half in a 2\u20130 defeat by their Swiss equivalents, before giving way to George Thompson at half time.

The duo's first season in charge of Derby saw the club finish one place lower, 18th, than the previous campaign but it saw the recruitment of numerous players, such Roy McFarland, John O'Hare and Alan Hinton, who between them made 1,154 appearances for the club and would go on to form the spine of the club's most successful ever side. Of the inherited squad, eleven players departed and only four were retained: Kevin Hector, Alan Durban, Ron Webster and Colin Boulton. Clough also fired the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a defeat. The season was notable for a run to the League Cup semi finals, the club's first ever notable run in the competition, where they lost 4\u20132 on aggregate to eventual winners Leeds United.
