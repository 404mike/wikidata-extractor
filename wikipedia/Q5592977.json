A wicket-keeper, he first played for Kent's Second XI in 1990 before making his first-class cricket debut for the county in May 1991. He played five times for Kent's First XI in 1991 and 1992 before moving to Surrey ahead of the 1993 season. With Alec Stewart often on international duty, he found himself as the first choice wicket-keeper, making 49 first-class and 29 List A appearances for the county. He was Surrey's Player of the Year in 1995 and was awarded his county cap at the end of the 1996 season.During the 1996\u201397 English winter Kersey played Sydney Grade Cricket for Western Suburbs District Cricket Club in Australia. He was involved in a road traffic accident in Brisbane on 24 December 1996 and died on 1 January 1997 as a result of his severe head injuries. He was 25. Stewart, speaking after Kersey's death, described him as \"without doubt, the most popular man on the staff; a true players' player\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jonathan Batty", "response": ["On graduating from Durham University in 1995, Batty joined Hampshire. However, he was not retained. He continued his career on in minor county cricket before being offered contracts with Somerset and Surrey. He chose to become Surrey's third-choice wicket-keeper after Graham Kersey and Alec Stewart. Kersey, however, died from injuries in a car crash in Australia. With Stewart often unavailable to Surrey due to England duties, Batty was able to enjoy regular first team action, often opening the batting when Mark Butcher was also playing for England. Batty was a regular player in Surrey's sustained success, winning three county championships around the turn of the century."]}, {"page": "Beths Grammar School", "response": ["*Graham Kersey \u2013 Former county cricketer"]}, {"page": "1997 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 1 January \u2013 Graham Kersey, cricketer (born 1971); died in a car crash"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Bexley", "response": ["*Graham Kersey (1971\u20131997), Surrey county cricketer, attended Beths Grammar School."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 1997", "response": ["*Graham Kersey, 25, English cricketer, traffic accident.Richard Bright Obituary: Graham Kersey dies after crash, The Daily Telegraph, 1997-01-03.
