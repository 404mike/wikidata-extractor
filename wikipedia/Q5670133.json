He was director of the Department of Educational Studies from 1973 to 1988.  His 80th birthday was marked by the publication of a special volume of the Oxford Review of Education.  He was the honorary president of the Oxford Education Society.Born in Cardiff, after two years in the Royal Air Force he studied at Brasenose College, taking degrees in Modern History and in Theology.  While teaching in schools in London and Surrey he completed a Ph.D. in French history and in 1959 was invited to become director of studies at the St Katharine\u2019s Foundation, Cumberland Lodge. In 1962, he was appointed Headmaster of Banbury Grammar School and coordinated its merger with three other secondary schools to form Banbury School (now Wykham Park Academy), of which he became the first principal.While in Banbury, he was a member of the Public Schools Commissions  and in 1970 of the James Committee of Enquiry into Teacher Education. In 1973, he was elected as director of the Oxford University Department of Educational Studies (later to be renamed the Department of Education) and a professorial fellow of  Brasenose College. His work at Oxford focused on building a research partnership extending across the university and on integrating the university role with that of local schools in the professional education of teachers.In the 1980s he chaired the BBC Schools Broadcasting Council and the Royal College of Nursing Commission on the education of nurses.  He completed for the Ford Foundation a report on graduate schools of education in the United States, and on his retirement from his Oxford appointments became professor of teacher education policy  at Michigan State University, subsequently  serving as a senior scholar at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching at Stanford University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Toby Young", "response": ["Young was educated at Creighton School (now Fortismere School), Muswell Hill and King Edward VI Community College, Totnes. Young later claimed that he was not popular at school, writing, \"My only friend was a black boy called Remi, who explained that the reason he'd taken a shine to me was because he knew what it was like to be a 'nigger'.\" He left school at 16 having failed all but one of his O Levels, a C in English Literature, and worked under a Government Youth Training Scheme. He then retook his O Levels and went to the Sixth Form of William Ellis School, Highgate, leaving with two Bs and a C at A Level. Despite thus failing to achieve the college's BBB offer, he was given a place at Brasenose College, Oxford. Young said he was sent an acceptance letter by mistake, as well as a letter of rejection from the admissions tutor Harry Judge. In an article he wrote for The Spectator, he said that his father phoned Judge to clarify the situation \u2013 Judge was in a meeting with the PPE tutors at the time, and after some discussion, they decided to offer Young a place owing to a moral obligation the mistaken acceptance created. He had been given a conditional offer of three Bs plus an O Level pass in a foreign language under a scheme to give access to comprehensive pupils."]}, {"page": "Wykham Park Academy", "response": ["Before the school's name was changed to Banbury Grammar School in 1946, it was called Banbury County School and was a mixed school for boys and girls from the ages of 11 to 18/19.
