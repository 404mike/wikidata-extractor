Gower is a palaeontologist.\nBefore making his debut for the Strongroom CC in 2000, he was a herpetology researcher at the Museum of Natural History in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Postosuchus", "response": ["Specimens similar to Postosuchus were discovered in Crosby County, Texas in 1920, and described by paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case in 1922.Case (1922), pp. 78\u201380.Case (1922), pp. 70\u201374. The fossils were composed only of an isolated braincase (UM 7473) and fragments of pelvic bones (UM 7244). Case then mistakenly assigned these specimens to the dinosaur genus Coelophysis.Case (1932), pp. 81\u201382. In the case of the braincase later assigned to Postosuchus, in 2002 paleontologist David J. Gower argued that the specimen is not complete and may belong to an ornithodire.Gower (2002), p. 66. Between 1932 and 1934, Case discovered other fossils of caudal vertebrae (UMMP 13670) in Rotten Hill, Texas, and a complete pelvis (UCMP V72183/113314) near Kalgary, Texas.Peyer et al. (2008), pp. 363\u2013364. Within the same period, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp collected over a hundred \"rauisuchian\" bones, from what is now the Petrified Forest National Park of Arizona, which belong to at least seven individuals (UCMP A296, MNA 207C). Later, more remains came to light. In 1943, Case again described a pelvis along with a pubis (UM 23127) from the Dockum Group of Texas, which dates from the Carnian through the early Norian stages of Late Triassic period.Case (1943), pp. 201\u2013203. These early findings, from 1932 to 1943, were initially referred to as a new phytosaur reptile, but assigned forty years later to Postosuchus.Chatterjee (1985), p. 395."]}, {"page": "Aetosaur", "response": ["In 2003, paleontologists Simon R. Harris, David J. Gower, and Mark Wilkinson examined previous phylogenetic studies of aetosaurs and criticized the way in which they used certain characters to produce cladograms. They concluded that only three hypotheses of aetosaur relationships from previous studies were still true: that Aetosaurus is the most basal aetosaur, that Aetosauroides is the sister taxon of Stagonolepis robertsoni, and that Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus are more closely related to each other than either is to Neoaetosauroides. They also went on to correct the trees from all previous analyses."]}, {"page": "Batrachotomus", "response": ["Batrachotomus  is a genus of prehistoric archosaur. Fossils of this animal have been found in southern Germany and dated from the Ladinian stage of the Middle Triassic period, around 242 to 237 million years ago. Batrachotomus was described by palaeontologist David J. Gower 22 years after its discovery.", "The fossils recovered from a marlstone remained undescribed until 1999 and palaeontologists referred to the genus simply as \"rauisuchid\" or \"Kupferzellia\". In 1999, palaeontologist David J. Gower described the holotype (SMNS 52970) from the 1977 excavation, which is the largest specimen of the genus, comprised by incomplete skull and postcranial material. Anatomy of the braincase (SMNS 80260) was made three years later, shedding light on the evolutionary relationships of the poorly known group of Rauisuchia.Gower (2002), p. 49.

Michael Parrish kept Y. sinensis as a species of Vjushkovia in his 1992 study of erythrosuchids, and continued to recognize Vjushkovia as a valid taxon distinct from Garjainia. Sennikov, along with paleontologist David J. Gower, rejected Parrish's conclusions in 2000 by considering V. triplocostata, the type species of Vjushkovia, a junior synonym of Garjainia prima. In his 2000 overview of rauisuchians, Gower did not consider Y. sinensis to be a synonym of G. prima, instead suggesting that it was a rauisuchid. Martin Ezcurra (2016)'s study of archosauromorph classification placed Youngosuchus as a close relative of the loricatan Batrachotomus, positioned far away from Garjainia (which was considered indistinguishable from Vjushkovia)."]}, {"page": "Ichthyophis moustakius", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by David J.
