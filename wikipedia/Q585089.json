He was a member of the Merton School, Oxford, elected a Fellow of Merton c. 1330, perhaps until the year 1342, having formerly been a member of Balliol. He was a Doctor of Medicine of the University of Oxford. He left manuscripts and scientific instruments to a number of Oxford colleges, perhaps including the bequest of the Oriel astrolabe (c. 1340), which is now in the Museum of the History of Science.\nHe was one of the earliest European mathematicians to work on trigonometry.\nAuthorship of the treatise The equatorie of the planetis has been attributed to Bredon, though also to Geoffrey Chaucer or another contemporary. The Theorica planetarum in the past attributed to him is now thought to be by Walter Brit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Allen (mathematician)", "response": ["A considerable part of Allen's collection was presented to the Bodleian Library by Sir Kenelm Digby, to whom it had been left: over 200 manuscripts, which were rebound in calf. This bequest was strong in works by early English scientists, including Roger Bacon, Simon Bredon, John Eschenden, Robert Grosseteste, John Sharp, and Richard Wallingford. But Allen's library was in flux during his lifetime, as he lent or gave items, and was consulted by others. He was a significant supporter of Sir Thomas Bodley's effort to found the Library; and gave it a number of works. Some went to the Cottonian Library, presumably via Richard James. Sir Thomas Aylesbury, another former pupil, was another one of Allen's major legatees. The Cuthbert Gospel of St John, seen in his library by James Ussher, appears to have left his possession by 1622, as it is not in a catalogue of that date. Ussher wrote to Camden in 1606 of the help he had had from Allen's collection, consulting William of Malmesbury, and a papal bull from Giraldus Cambrensis via Johannes Rossus.Charles Richard Elrington The Whole Works of the Most.

James Ussher D.D. vol. 15 (1864), pp. 5\u201318; archive.org."]}, {"page": "Walter Brit", "response": ["The work most frequently cited as Brit's is the Theorica Planetarum, which bears his name in two manuscripts in the Bodleian Library (Digby, xv. ff. 58 b-92, and Wood, 8 d, f. 93); it has also been claimed for Simon Bredon. Pederson considers it as Brit's."]}]}}
