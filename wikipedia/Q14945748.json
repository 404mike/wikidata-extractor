He was consistently critical of Israel, labelling some of the country's actions against Palestinians as \"war crimes\". One of his beliefs was that he should report events from the point of view of the victim rather than those in authority.Pat and Samir Twair, Robert Fisk on Reporting \"From the Viewpoint Of the Victim\", Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, December 2008. \"A story should be told from the viewpoint of the victim whose blood is being spilled. During the time of the slave trade, I\u2019d have interviewed the slaves, not the captain of the slave ship.\" The Times newspaper, in its November 2020 obituary of Fisk, said that he had developed a \"visceral dislike of the Israeli government and its allies\" following his coverage of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, alleging that this had made Fisk biased and \"unable to provide a dispassionate account of events and their context\". David Pryce-Jones, writing in The Spectator in 2003, said that Fisk was guilty of \"hysteria and distortion\" in his coverage of Middle Eastern topics. The Independent, for whom he wrote from 1989, praised him as being \"renowned for his courage in questioning official narratives from governments\"."]}, {"page": "Suez Crisis", "response": ["Eden's major mistake had been not to strike in July 1956 when there was widespread anger at Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, as by the fall of 1956 public anger had subsided, with many people in Britain having come to accept the fait accompli, and saw no reason for war. This was especially the case as Eden's claims that the Egyptians would hopelessly mismanage the canal had proven groundless, and that by September 1956 it was clear that the change of management had not affected shipping. Even more importantly, Eden's obsession with secrecy and his desire to keep the preparations for war as secret as possible meant that the Eden government did nothing in the months running up to the attack to explain to the British people why it was felt that war was necessary. Many of the reservists who were called up for their National Service in the summer and fall of 1956 recalled feeling bewildered and confused as the Eden government started preparing to attack Egypt while at the same time Eden insisted in public that he wanted a peaceful resolution of the dispute, and was opposed to attacking Egypt. The British author David Pryce-Jones recalled that as a young officer, after the ultimatum was submitted to Egypt he had to explain to his troops why war with Egypt was necessary without believing a word that he was saying.Pryce-Jones, David The Closed Circle: An Interpretation of the Arabs, Chicago: Ivan Dee, 2002, p. 4.
