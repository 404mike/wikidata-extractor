The Greek state was only able to restore the palace interiors in 1954 with the help of a private trust organised by Sir Charles Peake, the then British Ambassador to Greece.

The KPH concluded that most HRSS committees were established and maintained by Communists while Ma\u010dek loyalists were present in other committees, pursuing an agenda hostile to the KPH. It was decided that no further HRSS organisations would be set up, and that the existing ones would become less active. The executive committee did not meet between June 1945 and July 1947. By 1947, the KPJ declared that its programme was the NFJ's programme and that the KPJ is in the forefront of the NFJ. Tito linked the collapse of the pre-war Yugoslavia with the multi-party system of government to justify the suppression of political opposition parties. He called the multi-party system incompatible with the socialist order and unnecessary. Virtually all activities of the HRSS ceased shortly afterward. The Slobodni dom continued to be published, but the party slogan\u2014Faith in God and Peasant Unity (Vjera u boga i selja\u010dka sloga)\u2014was dropped from its cover on 1 January 1948. In the wake of the Tito\u2013Stalin split, the KPH attempted to reactivate the HRSS in 1950. From 1950 to 1953 mandate, the Presidium of the Sabor included six seats assigned to the HRSS, out of 27. British Ambassador Charles Peake considered these HRSS politicians to be ageing second-rate politicians and distrusted opportunists."]}]}}
