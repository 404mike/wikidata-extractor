One of a set of cuff-links bought as a present for George also goes missing and ends up in the food.

While clearing it out, Chrissy finds some old love letters written by George to someone named 'Mil'. Robin, Chrissy and Jo assume these are to Mildred, but when they are presented to Mildred it is revealed by George that they were not to Mildred but to Millicent Briggs, who was Mildred's maid of honour at their wedding!"]}, {"page": "Judy Matheson", "response": ["Matheson's theatre work includes starring opposite Richard O'Sullivan in a British tour of the comedy Boeing-Boeing with Yootha Joyce, Sally Thomsett and Doug Fisher, Ray Cooney's Chase Me Comrade, Stage Struck by Simon Gray, Hugh and Margaret Williams\u2019 The Flip Side, Funny Peculiar by Mike Stott, and Alan Ayckbourn's Bedroom Farce.
