He had four successful seasons for Lancashire from 1946 to 1949, taking almost 400 wickets, but the younger left-arm spinners Malcolm Hilton and Bob Berry replaced him in the county team, and he returned to club cricket in 1951. After illness and an operation he died in August that year, aged 36.He became famous when he dismissed Australian batsman Don Bradman in 1948. He took 6 for 73 off 42 overs in the Australians' first innings, then on the last day he held out against the bowling of Ray Lindwall to give Lancashire a draw. His best first-class figures were 8 for 50 (match figures of 51.5\u201323\u201383\u201311) for Lancashire against Oxford University in 1949.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["Cyril Washbrook's benefit match brought him a then record sum, \u00a314,000, but it was a mixed experience because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test. The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes (67) reaching 50. Nine of the Australians made a start, reaching 14, but could not capitalise on their opportunities, and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123. The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6/73. Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38, while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece, but the Australians did not enforce the follow on. Australia made 265/5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133, his highest at Old Trafford, with 90 for Barnes. Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match, but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (1949), pp. 249\u2013250. Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers. Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller, who refused to bowl, saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century. Lindwall (4/27) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century.Perry (2005), p. 249."]}, {"page": "William Roberts", "response": ["William Roberts, Will Roberts or Bill Roberts may refer to:", "* William Roberts (biographer) (1767\u20131849), English barrister and legal writer", "* William Roberts (painter) (1895\u20131980), British painter and war artist", "* William Roberts (screenwriter) (1913\u20131997), American screenwriter", "* William Roberts (musician) (1936\u20132017), American songwriter and musician", "* William Roberts (Parliamentarian) (1605\u20131662), British MP and father of Sir William Roberts, 1st Baronet", "* William Roberts (Australian politician) (1821\u20131900), New South Wales politician", "* William Roberts (Alberta politician) (born 1954), Canadian politician, Alberta, 1986\u20131993", "* William Roberts (bishop of Bangor) (1585\u20131665), Anglican bishop", "* William Roberts (MCC cricketer) (1795\u20131843), English cricketer", "* William Roberts (Australian cricketer), Australian cricketer, played in the 1880s", "* William Roberts (Lancashire cricketer) (1914\u20131951), English cricketer", "* William Roberts (footballer, born 1859) (1859\u2013?), Llangollen F.C., Berwyn Rangers F.C. and Wales international footballer", "* William Roberts (footballer, born 1863) (1863\u2013?), Rhyl F.C. and Wales international footballer", "* William Roberts (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u2013?), Cardiff City F.C. footballer", "* William Roberts (rugby union) (1871\u20131937), New Zealand rugby union player", "* William Roberts (American football) (born 1962), former NFL offensive lineman", "* Sir William Roberts, 1st Baronet (1638\u20131688), British landowner", "* William Roberts (physician) (1830\u20131899), British scientist", "* William Roberts (veteran) (1900\u20132006), British veteran of the First World War"]}, {"page": "Dick Pollard", "response": ["Lancashire's reliance on Pollard lessened during the 1948 season, when his County Championship total of 95 wickets was only eight ahead of the slow left-arm bowler William Roberts.
