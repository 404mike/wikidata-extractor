During the Anglo-Manipur War of 1891, British power was used to undo a coup within the ruling Royal family. Ethel's husband Frank Grimwood was the British representative in Manipur and the Grimwood's were on good terms with the new rulers. British troops arrived and civilians died in their foolhardy attack. Frank and the rest of a negotiating team were killed. Junior officers then lead a disorganised retreat from the residency where Ethel was the only woman. Her role was lionised in the British press and she was awarded a medal, \u00a31,000 and a pension. She mismanaged this money, married again, and died poor in Portland, Oregon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles James William Grant", "response": ["* Ethel Grimwood"]}, {"page": "Tikendrajit Singh", "response": ["On 31 March 1891 the British Government sent a military force against Manipur formed by three army columns from Kohima (under the command of Major General H. Collet), Silchar (under the command of Colonel R.H.F. Rennick) and Tamu (under the command of Brigadier General T. Graham) were sent to Manipur. Tikendrajit led the Manipuri army in this war. The British army finally took possession of the Kangla Palace on 27 April 1891. Major Maxwell took over as the chief political agent. Later, Manipur became a princely state and Churachand Singh, a minor was placed on the throne of Manipur. Tikendrajit and other leaders of Manipur subsequently went underground. Tikendrajit was arrested in the evening of 23 May. Ethel Grimwood was consulted by Queen Victoria who was concerned that a Prince would be hung when the British appeared treacherous. Grimwood said that she did not hold Tikendrajit responsible for her husband's death, but she felt that he had committed other crimes.", "*Ethel Grimwood"]}, {"page": "James Wallace Quinton", "response": ["In March 1891, owing to a rebellion having broken out in the small native state of Manipur, led by two of the younger brothers of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, who abdicated and took refuge at Calcutta, Quinton was sent to Manipur with an escort of five hundred Ghurkhas, and with instructions to recognise as the ruler of the state the second brother, who was acting as regent, and to arrest one of the younger brothers, Tikendrajit. Quinton reached Manipur on 22 March, and at once summoned a durbar, at which he intended to arrest the s\u00ednapati. Tikendraji, did not attend, and upon an attempt being made on the following day to arrest him in the fort, resistance was met by the Manipur troops, and was followed by an attack upon the British residency and camp, attended by considerable slaughter. Quinton thereupon offered to treat with the rebels, and was induced to repair to the fort, accompanied by Frank St. Clair Grimwood, the political agent, by Colonel Skene, the officer commanding the Ghurkhas, and by two other officers, all without arms. Immediately on their arrival they were taken prisoners and murdered. Quinton's hand was cut off, his body hacked to pieces, and his dismembered limbs thrown outside the city walls to be devoured by pariah dogs. Manipur was subsequently retaken by a British force; the s\u00ednapati was hanged, and the regent deposed. A young boy belonging to the family was recognised as r\u00e1j\u00e1, and during his minority the government of the state was entrusted to a British officer as political resident. Pensions of 300l. and 100l. a year respectively were granted to Quinton's widow and mother. Ethel Grimwood was declared the hero of the event and she received over \u00a31,000 and \u00a3140 per year."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Manipur War", "response": ["The surviving British troops besieged in the residency were led out by two junior officers in the dead of night, along with Frank Grimwood's wife Ethel Grimwood. It was a disorganised retreat. But they were met in the forests by a relief party arriving from Cachar and were rescued. The Residency was set on fire soon after their departure.", "The only woman in the retreat from the residency was Ethel Grimwood, who was later lionised as a heroine of the \"Manipur Disaster\" when she returned to Britain. She received a medal, \u00a31,000, a civil list pension and she wrote her biography. It is unclear now as to her contribution, but a hero was required and Ethel became that hero.", "Ethel Grimwood was given \u00a31,000, a pension and the Royal Red Cross (despite having no links to nursing). British participants of the Manipuri expedition received the North East Frontier clasp for the India General Service Medal. Colonel Charles James William Grant also received the Victoria Cross, for his actions during the battle of Thoubal.The medal received by Colonel Charles James William Grant was auctioned on 24 June 2021 along with other collections of historical importance for an estimated sum of \u00a3420,000.
