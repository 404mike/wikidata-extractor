During the Anglo-Manipur War of 1891, British power was used to undo a coup within the ruling Royal family. Ethel's husband Frank Grimwood was the British representative in Manipur and the Grimwood's were on good terms with the new rulers. British troops arrived and civilians died in their foolhardy attack. Frank and the rest of a negotiating team were killed. Junior officers then lead a disorganised retreat from the residency where Ethel was the only woman. Her role was lionised in the British press and she was awarded a medal, \u00a31,000 and a pension. She mismanaged this money, married again, and died poor in Portland, Oregon.", "link_mentions": {}}}
