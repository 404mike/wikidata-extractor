During the Second World War, she designed and developed \"Miss Shilling's orifice\" to restrict fuel flow to the carburettor of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters. Previously the pilots had experienced a loss of power or even complete engine cut-out during combat manoeuvres, posing a potentially lethal disadvantage in the Battle of Britain.\nShilling raced motorbikes at Brooklands in the 1930s, one of only three women awarded a BMCRC (British Motorcycle Racing Club) Gold Star for lapping the circuit at over 100 miles per hour (160 km/h).

The first Mk1s took to the track with old 2.7-liter Coventry Climax FPF inline-4 engines in their place. Once the Weslake was ready, however, the car proved to be highly competitive, if  unreliable. The high-revving V12 had been constructed using surplus machine tools dating from World War I, so tolerances and parts interchangeability were poor. Nevertheless, when running the Weslake was an immediately arresting engine, with a distinctive V12-scream, and developed 360bhp even in its earliest development phase. By the end of the 1967 season this figure was over 400\u00a0bhp, easily competing with the Ferrari and Honda V12s, and the newly introduced Cosworth DFV V8. One mechanical flaw that limited the engine's power output involved a design mistake in the oil scavenging system. This problem\u2014discovered too late in the development process to correct\u2014caused oil to pool in the engine's sump, slightly reducing power. Gurney described the effect as \"taking the edge\" off the engine after three or four laps of a race.
