He died in 1952, aged about 60.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Evans (footballer, born 1896)", "response": ["Evans was born in Dudley, which is now in the West Midlands county. He played local football before joining Birmingham during the First World War. When the Football League resumed, Evans made his debut in the Second Division on 27 September 1919, standing in for Joe Roulson at right half in a home game against Huddersfield Town which Birmingham won 4\u20132. He played five more games during the 1919\u201320 season, in each case taking Roulson's place at right half either in his absence or while he switched to the left to replace Percy Barton.Matthews, p. 162. Unable to establish himself as a first-team player, Evans spent the 1921\u201322 season in the Third Division South with Brighton & Hove Albion, but played only five matches when regular right half Jack Woodhouse was unavailable through injury. He then returned to the Black Country where he played for several years in the Birmingham & District League for Cradley Heath."]}, {"page": "Roulson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Roulson"]}]}}
