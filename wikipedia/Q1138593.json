MacLean also won a bronze medal for Scotland in the Team sprint at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, followed by a gold medal in the event at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Australia. Having returned to the Paralympic form of the sport as a guide to Neil Fachie, he won a further two golds at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in, and for, his native Scotland; in the Commonwealth Games, certain para-cycling events are integrated as full medal events into the programme.\nHe was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to cycling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Craig MacLean (born 1971), world, Olympic and Commonwealth champion track cyclist"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Craig MacLean \u2013 BBC Sport 2013"]}, {"page": "Grantown-on-Spey", "response": ["The Craig MacLean Leisure Centre is a public leisure centre in the town, with a swimming pool and gym.", "* Craig MacLean, Track Cyclist"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 2000 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|Chris HoyCraig MacLeanJason Queally"]}, {"page": "Jason Gardener", "response": ["In 2008 Jason took part in a project to qualify four athletes from diverse sports in the British 2 Man Bobsleigh Championships, after just two weeks of training.
