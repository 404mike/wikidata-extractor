The documentary was produced and directed by boxing analyst Mike DeLisa and was included with the original film and other materials in a 2005 DVD release. Also, Russell's Beatlesque song \"Don't Turn Me Down\", written with former Beatlemania star Joe Pecorino and conceived for Ringo Starr's consideration, was included on the soundtrack for the 2016 short film \"Pepperland II.\" (Developed by Pete Clements, Pepperland II is the continuation of his homage to the Beatles' 1968 film Yellow Submarine.) Lead singer is comedian and celebrity impersonator Stevie Riks, with Russell and Pecorino providing background vocals."]}]}}
