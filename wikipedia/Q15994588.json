The Associated Irish Mining Company then operated there to 1816. When gold was discovered in the locality in 1795, Mills and Weaver reported to the government; and Mills and John Lloyd wrote scientific papers about it. During the Irish Rebellion of 1798 Mills acted as a militia commander, with the rank of captain in the Cronebane Infantry.Alborn, p. 365. In November 1798 the mines were transferred to a partnership of Mills and Thomas Weaver (the younger).Smith, p. 529.

In Two Letters from Abraham Mills, Esq. to John Lloyd, Esq. F. R. S. in the geological debate of the time, this paper made Mills a supporter of the igneous theory.
