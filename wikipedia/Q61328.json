He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The prince, 48 years Ernest's junior, settled things with what Albert described as a \"strong push\" and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred on the grounds that they might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, \"When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me.\" Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, \"Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs.\" This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, \"No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!\" The Queen also recorded that though the King greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak. The King made a point of welcoming British visitors to Hanover and when one Englishwoman told him that she had been lost in the city, the King denied that this was possible, as \"the whole country is no larger than a fourpenny bit.\""]}, {"page": "Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge", "response": ["|Princess Augusta of Cambridge||19 July 1822||4 December 1916||married 1843, Friedrich Wilhelm, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; had issue"]}, {"page": "Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel", "response": ["|Princess Augusta of Cambridge||19 July 1822||4 December 1916||married 1843, Friedrich Wilhelm, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; had issue"]}]}}
