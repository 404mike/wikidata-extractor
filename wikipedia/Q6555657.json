Whatman was the only one of the tourists to have been on one of the earlier tours, having been part of Lord Hawke's team in 1896-97 but had not played any first class cricket between the two tours. Bennett himself and Dashwood had not played first class cricket since 1899 but the remaining eight had played in 1901. Many of the tourists were ex-Oxbridge cricketers, five of them having played in the 1901 Oxford v Cambridge match. The team was younger than the previous touring sides and although inexperienced was at least the standard of the two 1896-97 teams. Wilson received a telegram on his arrival announcing the death of his mother and Dowson was also unavailable for the first game having a cold. Even with Arbuthnot playing an additional player was required and J.A. Davenport made up the 11. A.G. Robinson played in a minor match on the tour.", "| align=left | Lionel Gough Arbuthnot || 7 || 11 || 6 || 44 || 17* || 8.80 || - || - || 2"]}, {"page": "Arbuthnot (surname)", "response": ["*Lionel Gough Arbuthnot, English cricketer"]}]}}
