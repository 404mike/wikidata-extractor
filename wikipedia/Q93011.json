He created and maintains PuTTY, a free software implementation of Secure Shell (SSH) and Telnet for Microsoft Windows and Unix, along with an xterm terminal emulator.  He is also the original author of Netwide Assembler (NASM), and maintains a collection of small computer programs which implement one-player puzzle games. All of them run natively on Nintendo DS, Symbian S60, Unix (GTK+; Android, MacOS), and Windows.\nHe attended University of Cambridge, and currently works at ARM Holdings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of programmers", "response": ["*Simon Tatham \u2013 Netwide Assembler (NASM), PuTTY"]}, {"page": "Netwide Assembler", "response": ["NASM was originally written by Simon Tatham with assistance from Julian Hall. , it is maintained by a small team led by H.

Simon Tatham's contribution, based on Duff's device, is a notable example of the genre, and is the basis for Protothreads and similar implementations. In addition to Duff's objections, Tatham's own comments provide a frank evaluation of the limitations of this approach: \"As far as I know, this is the worst piece of C hackery ever seen in serious production code.\" The main shortcomings of this approximation are that, in not maintaining a separate stack frame for each coroutine, local variables are not preserved across yields from the function, it is not possible to have multiple entries to the function, and control can only be yielded from the top-level routine.", "*ScummVM - The ScummVM project implements a light-weight version of stackless coroutines based on Simon Tatham's article.", "* Simon Tatham's C oriented comprehensive introduction to coroutines"]}, {"page": "C syntax", "response": ["It is possible, although unusual, to insert the  labels into the sub-blocks of other control structures.
