U.S. ambassador George H. W. Bush asked British ambassador Colin Crowe to talk to the Chinese, but Crowe thought that it would \"only arouse suspicion\".  Instead, they asked the Norwegian and Finnish ambassadors how the Chinese would vote, receiving assurances that the Chinese would continue to veto Waldheim.

French ambassador Jacques Kosciusco-Morizet said that it was \"not enough to have a candidate against whom there is no objection. A candidate for SYG [Secretary-General] should also have something in his favor.\"  British ambassador Colin Crowe disagreed that Waldheim was even \"non-objectionable\".  However, Waldheim received strong diplomatic backing from Austria's Social Democratic government under Bruno Kreisky, even though Waldheim was from the opposition Austrian People's Party.  Waldheim was also favored by the Soviet Union.  During a dinner at Waldheim's house, Soviet ambassador Yakov Malik proposed a toast to the host, \"May all your wishes come true.\""]}]}}
