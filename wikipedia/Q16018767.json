During service with the Royal Air Force, he wrote for the  Air Training Corps Gazette, later to become Air Pictorial.\nGreen was technical director to the RAF Flying Review, then editorial director when it became Flying Review International. In 1971 he and Gordon Swanborough jointly created the monthly Air International, of which he remained managing editor until late 1990.Green edited numerous editions of Observer's Book of Aircraft and spent most of his adult life doing research and writing on aircraft and aviation. His work Warplanes of the Third Reich is seen as a classic aviation publication. Along with Gordon Swanborough, he wrote several books, including The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of the Worlds Commercial Aircraft, Illustrated Anatomy of the World's Fighters, The Complete Book of Fighters and Flying Colours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Focke-Wulf Fw 187 Falke", "response": ["*Warplanes of the Third Reich, pp.\u00a0182\u2013187, William Green, Galahad Books, 1970, "]}, {"page": "Junkers Ju 390", "response": ["The first public mention of an alleged flight of a Ju 390 to North America appeared in a letter published in the November 1955 issue of the British magazine RAF Flying Review, of which aviation writer William Green was an editor. The magazine's editors were skeptical of the claim, which asserted that two Ju 390s had made the flight and that it included a one-hour stay over New York City. In March 1956, the Review published a letter from an RAF officer which claimed to clarify the account. According to Green's reporting, in June 1944, Allied Intelligence had learned from prisoner interrogations that a Ju 390 had been delivered in January 1944 to Fernaufkl\u00e4rungsgruppe 5, based at Mont-de-Marsan near Bordeaux and that it had completed a 32-hour reconnaissance flight to within  of the U.S. coast, north of New York City.Staerck et al. 2002, pp. 202\u2013203. This was rejected just after the war by British authorities.Bukowski and M\u00fcller 1995  Aviation historian Dr. Kenneth P. Werrell states that the story of the flight originated in General Report on Aircraft Engines and Aircraft Equipment, two British intelligence reports from August 1944, which were based in part on the interrogation of prisoners. The reports claimed that the Ju 390 had taken photographs of the coast of Long Island but no photos or other evidence for the existence of such photos has ever been found."]}, {"page": "William Green", "response": ["William Green may refer to", "*William Green (painter) (1760\u20131823), British artist", "*William Green (piper) (1775\u20131860), Northumbrian piper", "*William Green (action painter) (1934\u20132001), British artist", "*Sir William Green, 1st Baronet (1725\u20131811), British army officer", "*William Green (British Army soldier) (1784\u20131881), English veteran of the Napoleonic wars", "*William Green (British Army officer, born 1882) (1882\u20131947), British Army major-general", "*William Green (fl.1406), MP for Lewes", "*William Green (died 1555), MP for Downton", "*William Green (MP for Poole) (fl. 1563\u20131572), MP for Poole", "*William Green (lawyer) (1806\u20131880), Virginia lawyer, son of John W.
