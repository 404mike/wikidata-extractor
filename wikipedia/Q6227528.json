Coventry City won the game 2\u20130 with two goals from Alan Green in injury time of both halves. Telford thought he had done enough to earn a permanent contract but at the end of August manager Tony Book pulled Billy into his office and said \"Sorry Billy, there's nothing i can offer you, but play well in the reserves against Blackpool because there are a lot of clubs coming to look at you\" So Billy's trial at Manchester City was not made permanent and in September 1975 he was signed by Noel Cantwell manager for Peterborough United who were playing in the Third Division at the time."]}]}}
