She learned to swim in the Indian Ocean at the age of 4, and swam her first competition at 6.\nSwimming for Kenya, she won two gold medals at the 2008 African Swimming Championships (50m and 100m breaststroke), becoming the first female to win medals for Kenya at the African Championships. She also represented Kenya at the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Italy.\nIn early 2010, Ajulu-Bushell made the decision to start swimming for Great Britain, and after a customary period without representing Kenya (1 year) and with clearance from the Kenya federation, began swimming from Great Britain. She made her senior British debut at the 2010 European Championships in Budapest, Hungary, and went on to compete for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India.\nAjulu-Bushell attended Plymouth College and was a classmate of Olympic diving medalist Tom Daley, but moved to London as she stepped up her preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\nAjulu-Bushell withdrew from competitive swimming in 2012, following a plateau in form, and did not seek entry to the 2012 Games.
