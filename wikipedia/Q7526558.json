She married Edmund Tyrell, of Plashwood Hall, Haughley, in 1744, and the estate was inherited by their son, Edmund Tyrell, after the death of his father. This son, who had also inherited Plashwood Hall, sold the Nether Hall estate to George Chinery, of Bury St. Edmunds. In 1807 he left the Nether Hall estate to his nephew, the Rev. William Bassett, who was Rector of Thurston. His son, William C. Bassett succeeded by entail and was residing in Nether Hall in 1857. The Nether Hall Estate changed hands again in 1886 when it was purchased by William Hardcastle for \u00a338,000. He never lived in Nether Hall, and he very soon sold it to Sir Edward Greene, 1st Baronet, the Member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds.Nigel R.

Edwards, and then to the Martin family who modernised the interior of the building. Under the Martins Nether Hall became a country club of the Kristina Martin Charitable Trust. Nether Hall thus became a Country Club within the Trust. Mr Martin sold Nether Hall to the current occupants in 1987."]}]}}
