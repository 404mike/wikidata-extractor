After Gresham's School, he went up to Cambridge to read English. His initial career at the bar was interrupted by wartime service in the Royal Tank Regiment, which included a period commanding a special service squadron in Operation Ironclad (1942), the Allied invasion of Vichy-France-controlled Madagascar. He was then posted to India and served in the Burma campaign, ending the war a Lieutenant-Colonel. Returning to the bar, he was often junior to Seymour Karminski, KC. In the 1951 general election, he successfully stood as the Conservative candidate for Middlesbrough West; shortly afterward, he was appointed PPS to the Attorney-General and three years later sat on the Percy Commission on mental health law, which eventually led to the Mental Health Act 1959. He was Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Home Office from 1957 to 1958 (helping to pass the Homicide Act 1957) and then Financial Secretary to the Treasury (1958\u201359), before he was appointed Solicitor-General and (by convention) knighted. He was, however, compelled to relinquish that office and his seat in the Commons in 1962 when he was appointed President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court. In 1971, he has created Baron Simon of Glaisdale, and later that year became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. He retired in 1977 owing to poor health. Simon was especially concerned with family law; although generally liberal (and increasingly libertarian politically), he was conservative in his views about the family as an institution and about children's wellbeing, which he felt were being eroded by easier access to divorce. However, he also believed that women were often treated unfairly in divorce proceedings and he campaigned to have property and pensions divided more equally. He also firmly believed in the separation of the judicial and legislative branches of government, which led him to make conservative rulings even as he was involved in reform activities outside of court. His retirement from the judiciary allowed him to speak about legislative matters more frankly in the House of Lords, where he remained active until he gave his last speech in 2004; he was highly valued there for his legal expertise. He died in 2006; his wife and three children (including the judge Sir Peregrine Simon, QC) survived him."]}]}}
