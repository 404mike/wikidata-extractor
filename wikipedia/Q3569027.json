These soldiers would be assisted by 18,000 Austrians led by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze. Meanwhile, the British agent William Wickham would raise an army of 20,000 Swiss. The mostly-Russian force was supposed to invade France across the Jura Mountains. As soon as Korsakov's army was situated, Charles was to move north into southern Germany with 60,000 Austrians and invade France across the upper Rhine. Tsar Paul I of Russia and Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor approved this plan and issued the necessary orders which arrived at Charles' headquarters on 7 August. In fact, the archduke was reluctant to carry out the plan, since he believed that splitting up the Coalition armies was a mistake. In the end, bad timing ruined the new scheme; Charles would leave Switzerland too early and Suvorov would arrive in Switzerland too late.Duffy (1999), pp. 150\u2013154."]}, {"page": "Jean Bassal", "response": ["Appointed at the beginning of Directory as a secret agent in Basel, his mission was to ensure supplies of the army of Italy and monitor those suspected of not having denounced the counter revolution in Switzerland and remained in regular correspondence with one of the leaders (known as the Master, probably William Wickham) of the royalist insurrection of 13 Vendemiaire Year IV.

The Alien Office was part of the wider Government machinery of national security and intelligence, and its work needs to be seen in the context of this and of other legislation passed at the time, such as the Westminster Police Bill in 1792 (which created a system of stipendiary magistrates as part of an attempt to coordinate policing). William Wickham was appointed Superintendent of the Alien Office, in succession to Huskisson, in the summer of 1794. During Wickham's tenure, the office was enlarged in 1798 and, until his departure in 1802, it was, in reality, a functioning intelligence agency.

Karl von Bey's brigade held the upper Reuss valley. Charles established a flotilla on Lake Zurich under the command of James Ernest Williams. Charles told British agent William Wickham that his army could probably drive the French from their positions before Z\u00fcrich, but it would cost his troops so many casualties that he would be unable to exploit the victory.

The Army of Cond\u00e9, made up of 6,000 French Royalists, was marching from Russia but would not arrive in southern Germany until 1 October.

Suvorov would take command of the combined army and drive Mass\u00e9na's French army from western Switzerland. In a second impulse, Suvorov would invade Franche-Comt\u00e9, an area of France sparsely defended by frontier fortresses. Once Korsakov was securely in position in central Switzerland, Feldzeugmeister Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen would march his 60,000 troops north into Germany, leaving 18,000 Austrians under Hotze to cooperate with the Russians. Charles would thrust across the lower Rhine from southern Germany into France while a second Austrian army under General der Kavallerie Michael von Melas would invade Savoy from Italy.
