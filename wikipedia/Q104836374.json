He left Morton the year before the Greenock club won the Scottish Cup in 1922, but was a regular member of their team in the period around World War I when they finished in the top four of the Scottish Football League table for six seasons running (Stevenson missed one of these campaigns entirely, likely as a result of wartime commitments). He did take part in both of the Navy and Army War Fund Shield finals, the first of which in 1915 Morton won by defeating Rangers and the second in 1918 which they lost to Celtic. After he moved to Renfrewshire derby rivals St Mirren, Stevenson  quickly struck up a fruitful partnership with fellow new signing Dunky Walker, who finished as the top scorer across European club football in their first season together.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Greenock Morton F.C.", "response": ["*  Robert Stevenson"]}, {"page": "Robert Stevenson", "response": ["Robert Stevenson may refer to:", "* Robert Stevenson (actor and politician) (1915\u20131975), American actor and politician", "* Robert Stevenson (civil engineer) (1772\u20131850), Scottish lighthouse engineer", "* Robert Stevenson (director) (1905\u20131986), English film writer and director", "* Robert Stevenson (musicologist) (1916\u20132012), American musicologist", "* Robert Louis Stevenson (1850\u20131894), Scottish writer and grandson of the lighthouse engineer Robert Stevenson", "* Robert Lindsay (actor) (Robert Stevenson, born 1949), English actor", "* Robert Stevenson (Australian footballer) (born 1976), former Australian rules footballer", "* Robert Stevenson (basketball), first head men's basketball coach at DePaul University", "* Robert Stevenson (equestrian) (born 1968), Canadian Olympic equestrian", "* Robert Stevenson (footballer, born 1869) (1869\u2013?), Scottish footballer (Thames Ironworks)", "* Robert Stevenson (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u2013?), Scottish footballer (Grimsby Town)", "* Robert Stevenson (Scottish footballer) ( 1910s), Scottish footballer (Morton, St Mirren)"]}]}}
