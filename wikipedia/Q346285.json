Once hired, he spent several months in a hotel room working on the soundtrack, spending more time rewriting the music and improving it, during delays due to film companies trying to get the rights to distribution.

Some DVD versions of early SG-1 seasons have different opening credits from the television versions, as do the direct-to-DVD films.
