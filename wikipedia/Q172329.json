The original car was built in Bristol in 1936 and featured an Anzani engine which was replaced in 1937 by a Blackburne engine.  Joe set a number of hill records during the late 1930s including an unofficial outright record at Prescott when he climbed in 47.62 seconds in the 1,100 c.c. Freikaiserwagen, on 27 August 1938.   At the outbreak of World War Two he held both the blown and unblown 1,100 c.c. records at Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb in  41.52 and 42.58 seconds respectively.Fry finished second in class, for racing cars up to 1,100 c.c., in the Freikaiserwagen at the Brighton Speed Trials in 1947. He drove the car to a class victory at Brighton the following year recording a faster time. He won the class again at Brighton in 1949 reducing his time yet again.At Blandford hillclimb on 28 May 1949: \"J.G. Fry made f.t.d. in the 650 lb., twin Marshall-blown V-twin Freikaiserwagen.\" His winning time was 31.13 seconds.At Bouley Bay Hill Climb, Jersey, on 21 July 1949, Fry finished first in class but overall a runner-up to Sydney Allard, at which point Fry led the British Hill Climb Championship. At the final round at Prescott he was just one point behind Sydney Allard, but he had mechanical problems and slumped to fourth overall behind Allard, Poore and Moss in the final standings.Fry was killed at the wheel of the Freikaiserwagen at the 1950 Blandford hillclimb, less than two months after driving a Maserati 4CL in the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Raymond Mays said: \"The death of Joe Fry, from injuries received while practicing for a Blandford hill-climb, was a great blow to me and to British motor sport in general.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 29", "response": ["*1950 \u2013 Joe Fry, English race car driver (b. 1915)"]}, {"page": "October 26", "response": ["*  1915   \u2013 Joe Fry, English race car driver (d. 1950)"]}, {"page": "Winterbourne, Gloucestershire", "response": ["*Joe Fry, racing driver, was born in Winterbourne in 1915."]}, {"page": "List of Formula One drivers", "response": ["|align=\"left\" data-sort-value=\"1\"|Geoffrey Crossley, Joe Fry, Bob Gerard, David Hampshire, Cuth Harrison, Leslie Johnson, David Murray, Reg Parnell, Peter Walker()"]}, {"page": "1950 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Joe Fry", "| Joe Fry", ": \u2014 Joe Fry qualified and drove 45 laps of the race in the #10 Maserati.
