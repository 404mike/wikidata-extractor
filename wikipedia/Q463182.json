Though her decision to portray Ryan as a reflective personality \u2013 sometimes staring into space \u2013 was satirised by the comedienne Dawn French, she helped lay the groundwork for what was to become one of the most popular BBC series, continuing to run (albeit without her) to the present (September 2021). After Silent Witness, she took on the role of Prosecutor Helen West in a series based on Frances Fyfield's novels. She also played Aunt Polly in a 2003 remake of Pollyanna and Commander Clare Blake in Lynda La Plante's drama, The Commander."]}, {"page": "Deal, Kent", "response": ["* It is the (renamed) setting of Frances Fyfield's crime novel Undercurrents."]}, {"page": "Fyfield", "response": ["*Frances Fyfield (born 1948), pseudonym of Frances Hegarty, English lawyer and crime-writer"]}, {"page": "Agatha Award", "response": ["* Frances Fyfield, A Question of Guilt"]}, {"page": "List of female detective characters", "response": ["* Sarah Fortune is a solicitor and freelance unpaid sex therapist who unravels mysteries that she finds around her in a series commenced 1989 by Frances Fyfield.", "* Helen West is a driven prosecutor with a keen sense of justice in a book series 1988\u20131996 by Frances Fyfield, twice adapted for television, with Helen played firstly by Juliet Stevenson'Trial by Fire (1999)' IMDb and then by Amanda Burton.The Helen West Casebook "]}, {"page": "Gold Dagger", "response": ["* Duncan Lawrie Dagger: Frances Fyfield, Blood From Stone", "** Frances Fyfield, Safer Than Houses", "** Frances Fyfield, Staring at the Light", "* Silver Dagger: Frances Fyfield, Deep Sleep"]}, {"page": "Frances Hegarty", "response": ["#REDIRECTFrances Fyfield"]}, {"page": "Grand Prix de Litt\u00e9rature Polici\u00e8re", "response": ["*1998 \u2013 Shadow Play by Frances Fyfield (UK, 1993)"]}]}}
