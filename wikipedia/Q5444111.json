He was nominated for an All Star four times but narrowly missed out on each occasion.\nDoherty played his club football for Bellaghy Wolfe Tones. Doherty won the Derry Senior Football Championship twice with the club, as well as winning the 2000 Ulster Senior Club Football Championship.\nFor both club and county Doherty usually played in midfield. He was highly regarded for impressive high-fielding skills and work-rate, often helping in attack and also tracking back to help in defence. His ability to win breaking ball, read the game and plug gaps was impressive. Irish News journalist Paddy Heaney says of Doherty \"The Bellaghy man does not seek headlines, just victories. He was at one point the  Derry captain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doherty (surname)", "response": ["* Fergal Doherty (born 1981), Irish Gaelic footballer"]}, {"page": "Paddy Bradley", "response": ["Bradley and Derry again reached the National League final in 2009, but were defeated by Kerry.
