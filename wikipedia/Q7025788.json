He first went to Latin America where he traveled extensively and learned Spanish for a few years.  He then turned home to Plymouth, England but stayed only a short time before departing for Asia.  He eventually ended up in Singapore where he worked for Kerr & Co., a merchant house.  As the Philippines, opened to international trade, Kerr & Co. sent him to Manila where he became a popular figure among the business community.  When Iloilo City was opened to international trade in 1855, he was appointed as the first British Vice Consul in Iloilo the following year in 1856.  Sugar production was increasing due to growing price of sugar in Manila and Loney helped the plantation owners and farmers by providing loans and purchasing modern machinery from Europe through his firm, Loney & Ker Co., which helped increased the efficiency of sugar production in Panay and Negros. He also encouraged improvements in infrastructure at the port of Iloilo, reclamation of the western bank of Iloilo River and the construction of the Calle Progreso (present day Isidro de la Rama Street) which became the location of numerous sugar warehouses.\nHe died on 23 April 1869 while exploring Mount Kanlaon on Negros Island, Philippines of an unspecified disease. He was buried by the seashore under some coconut trees in what is now Rizal Street in Iloilo City.In March 1904, the Municipal Council of Iloilo passed a resolution naming the quay along the Iloilo River, part of the Port of Iloilo, as Muelle Loney, or Loney Waterfront.  In March 1981 a statue of him was unveiled at the end of Muelle Loney.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Iloilo City", "response": ["The waning textile industry was replaced, however, by the opening of Iloilo's port to the world market in 1855. Because of this, Iloilo's industry and agriculture was put on direct access to foreign markets. But what triggered the economic boom of Iloilo in the 19th century was the development of the sugar industry in Iloilo and its neighboring island of Negros. Sugar during the 19th century was of high demand. Nicholas Loney, the British vice-consul in Iloilo, developed the industry by giving loans, constructing warehouses in the port, and introducing new technologies in sugar farming. The rich families of Iloilo developed large areas of Negros, which were later called haciendas, because of sugar's high demand in the world market. Because of the increase in commercial activity, infrastructures, recreational facilities, educational institutions, banks, foreign consulates, commercial firms and much more sprouted in Iloilo."]}, {"page": "Aniceto Lacson", "response": ["In the later 19th century, a Swiss businessman by the name of Luchinger decided to sell his vast properties in Matabang, Talisay, which he earlier purchased from Nicholas Loney, the biggest sugar cane producer in Negros at that time. It was offered to Aniceto Lacson, but he did not have enough ready cash. Luchinger was willing to sell it on installment but Aniceto's father Lucio refused as the venture appeared risky. Aniceto negotiated with Luchinger to agree to sell it to him without guarantor. Knowing that Aniceto was hardworking, honest and followed through with his business commitments, Luchinger agreed."]}, {"page": "Hiligaynon people", "response": ["By the 19th century, the sugarcane industry became more expansive and modernized due to the confluence of increased port access and new technology and financial resources. A Spanish royal decree in 1855 ordered that the port be opened, with the expectation of increasing economic growth in areas beyond Manila. Given the safe location of the port and a long-standing history of trade, Iloilo was an ideal international port, thus becoming integrated into the international trade of the 19th century. The British vice-consul in Iloilo, Nicholas Loney, was instrumental in introducing technological and financial resources to the existing sugar elites. Better sugarcane seeds were introduced from Sumatra, and Loney undertook the purchasing of centrifugal iron mills, as well as the provision of loans to planters. These, accompanied by the demand for sugar, helped to encourage the movement of the sugarcane planters to Negros, expanding the hacienda system to there. Many of the workers (many native to Panay) who were part of the hacienda system, the \"dumaan\", became the underclass beneath the \"sugar barons\" of the haciendas, with a middle class existing between who maintained urban stores and banks. This class structure was to persist into the Commonwealth era and as the sugar industry shifted its focus from Panay to Negros following a labor strike in 1930\u20131931."]}, {"page": "Iloilo River", "response": ["The Port of Iloilo was opened for international trade on 1855 and the coming of British Vice-consul Nicholas Loney, a year later, that led to the fast development of sugar industry in the region."]}, {"page": "Yves Leopold Germain Gaston", "response": ["The iron mill allowed him to begin commercial production of export-quality sugar.

Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi placed Negros under the jurisdiction of the governor of Oton on Panay. In 1734, however, the island became a military district with Ilog as its first capital.

Loney through his firm, Loney and Kee Company, facilitated the fast development of sugar industry by importing sugar cuttings from Sumatra and machinery from England and Scotland to Iloilo, which the sugar planters can buy on easy installment loans.  Loney also built sailing boats called lorcha (boat)s, patterned after the Brixham trawlers used for deep-sea fishing in the English channel, at Buenavista on Guimaras Island to transport sugar from Negros Island. Envisioning the prosperity of a sugar industry in Visayas in the near future, Loney initiated its development in Negros and offered liberal terms to a few Negrense planters similar to those he had given the Ilonggo planters.  Consequently, some prominent Ilonggo sugarcane planters like the Ledesma, Lacson, Hilado, Cosculluela, P\u00e9rez, Alvarez, Sotamayor and Escanilla families moved to Negros in 1857 due to its promising development.
