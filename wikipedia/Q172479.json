Stirling Moss was out of action. Tony Brooks had switched from the BRP Cooper team to try the new Vanwall VW11, while Team Lotus had hired Ron Flockhart to replace Alan Stacey. BRP had two new drivers in Henry Taylor and Bruce Halford. In practice both Scarabs blew their engines so neither Lance Reventlow nor Chuck Daigh was able to race. Jack Brabham was on pole position by 1.4 seconds with Phil Hill's Ferrari and Graham Hill's BRM sharing the front row. Behind them were Innes Ireland's factory Lotus 18 and the Ferrari of Willy Mairesse. At the start, Graham Hill was caught unprepared and as he tried to get the BRM off the line he was hit from behind by the Scuderia Centro Sud Cooper of Maurice Trintignant. There was also a collision between Brooks and Lucien Bianchi's outdated Cooper. The battle for the lead involved Brabham and Phil Hill and the pair switched places lap after lap until Hill began to fade with transmission trouble. A similar problem took out third-placed Ferrari driver Wolfgang Von Trips and so Brabham was left out in front all by himself. Mairesse too retired with a similar problem and Ireland had to stop with a broken front suspension. Also retiring were the two surviving BRMS of Dan Gurney and Jo Bonnier disappeared with engine trouble. This left Gendebien in the BRP Cooper to take second with Bruce McLaren third in the second factory Cooper and with Taylor finishing fourth in his BRP Cooper the company could boast 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 finish. The Lotuses of Jim Clark and Flockhart finished fifth and sixth.", "The final World Championship event of the year took place in the United States 10 weeks after the penultimate event and Ferrari did not bother to travel to the Riverside circuit just east of Los Angeles, California but Phil Hill found a ride in a fourth BRP Cooper at his home circuit and Wolfgang Von Trips found a ride in a Cooper-Maserati run by Scuderia Centro Sud. In the sunny and pleasant southern California weather, Ron Flockhart turned up in the third factory Cooper and Jim Hall made his F1 debut in a private Lotus 18 and Chuck Daigh re-appeared in one of Lance Reventlow's Scarabs. Moss, by now recovered from his early season injuries, took pole by 0.6 seconds from World Champion Jack Brabham and Dan Gurney in his BRM. Jo Bonnier's BRM shared the second row with Jim Clark's Lotus. Brabham made the best start and led Moss for the first four laps but then he heard an explosion at back end of the car and pitted. He made two stops to try to solve the problem which was traced to overflow petrol hitting the hot exhausts of the Climax engine. Moss moved into the lead when Brabham pitted and he stayed ahead all the way to the chequered flag. Early on, he was chased by Gurney but he went out with plug problems and Bonnier followed, retiring from second with engine trouble. This left Innes Ireland to finish second for Team Lotus with the second factory Cooper of Bruce McLaren third. Brabham finished fourth, a lap behind at the finish. Jim Hall drove a good race to run fourth but he dropped to seventh at the end when his transmission failed and he had to push the car to the finish line. This was the only Grand Prix ever held at the Riverside circuit; 12 Hours of Sebring promoter Alec Ulmann had again broken even on this event just as he had at the previous year's American Grand Prix at Sebring. The US Grand Prix was moved to the Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York on the other side of the country.", "|align=\"left\"|  Ron Flockhart"]}, {"page": "1959 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Ron Flockhart", "|align=\"left\"|  Ron Flockhart", "|  Ron Flockhart"]}, {"page": "1958 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Ron Flockhart", "|  Ron Flockhart", "|align=\"left\"|  Ron Flockhart"]}]}}
