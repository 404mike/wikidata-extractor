She was an influential leader in the Arts and Crafts movement, not only for her stained glass work and successful studio-workshop, but also for opening doors for other women stained glass artists. She was an active participant in the suffragette movement, acting as Chair of the Artists' Suffrage League, and creating poster art to assist the movement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stained glass", "response": ["Among the most innovative English designers were the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris (1834\u20131898) and Edward Burne-Jones (1833\u20131898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.Peter Cormack, Arts & Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015 The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.", "Many 19th-century firms failed early in the 20th century as the Gothic movement was superseded by newer styles. At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the Glass House in London set up by Mary Lowndes and Alfred J. Drury and An T\u00far Gloine in Dublin, which was run by Sarah Purser and included artists such as Harry Clarke."]}, {"page": "Lowndes", "response": ["*Mary Lowndes (1856\u20131929), British artist"]}, {"page": "Louis Davis (painter)", "response": ["A few years after having worked with Christopher Wall, Davis worked in London with Mary Lowndes and Alfred J. Drury at Lowndes and Drury. He worked first at their premises in Chelsea, then from 1906 at their Glass House studio in Fulham. When the volume of work that Davis commissioned exceeded his ability to have the works made, he contracted with the London-based James Powell & Sons to make the works, particularly relying on principal glass-painter Thomas Cowell to interpret and execute the designs. Davis then maintained his own studio at Ewelme Cottage, Pinner.E. Lomas. Guide to the Archive of Art and Design: Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

Lowndes and Drury was founded in 1897 by the artist Mary Lowndes, and Alfred John Drury with the aim of providing independent designer- craft workers with the necessary facilities to carry out their stained glass commissions.", "It was in September 1901 that Alfred E. Child arrived in Dublin to take up the post of Instructor in Stained Glass at the newly reorganised Dublin Metropolitan School of Art and it seems that Whall was one of those who were behind this appointment along with the painter Sarah Purser, the poet W. B. Yeats and Edward Martyn the art critic. Child had been trained by Whall and would try to bring Whall\u2019s principles to a new generation of Irish artists. Child and his artist friends aimed to set up a workshop similar to that formed by Mary Lowndes and Alfred Drury in London and in 1903 Sarah Purser set up \"The Tower of Glass\" (in Gaelic \"An T\u00far Gloine\")."]}, {"page": "Veronica Whall", "response": ["* Mary Lowndes"]}, {"page": "All Saints Church, Harthill", "response": ["The church is built in ashlar red and buff sandstone with a Welsh slate roof and a stone ridge.
