He was born in Norwich and lived for almost fifty years in Ipswich. For although Reynolds is most widely known as a sculptor, he possessed the capacity to be an inspirational teacher as well as an artist, and he fulfilled both of these roles with his own particular kind of integrity. Reynolds was characterised for his quietly rigorous self-imposed discipline to every project he undertook \u2013 and due to his multiple pursuits, his projects were many and varied.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colchester Art Society", "response": ["The Permanent Collection includes a number of works produced by renowned East Anglian artists from the past half century, including: Roderic Barrett, Arthur Lett-Haines, Lucy Harwood (who also belonged to the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing), Blair Hughes-Stanton, John Nash (who was the first president of the Colchester Art Society), Cedric Morris, Bernard Reynolds and Valerie Thornton.
