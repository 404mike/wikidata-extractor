He went on to join the University of Essex in 1973, eventually rising to the chair of Professor of Sociology. During his time at the University, he gained an international reputation in sociology, and is widely read as a theoretician who ably links sociology and psychoanalysis.\nIn the mid-1980s, he received qualification as a psychotherapist and group analyst, bringing together his interests in the reciprocal effects between individuals, groups and societies. In the late 1980s he was central \u2014 along with Karl Figlio, Joan Busfield, Ken Plummer and John Walshe \u2014 to the creation of a master's degree in Sociology and Psychotherapy, organised jointly by the University of Essex and the Mental Health Trust. This was one of the first university courses of its type in the country, combining clinical experience with theoretical thinking.\nCraib's working-class origins influenced his understanding of class systems and the politics of power, and this partly explains his attachment in his late teens to Trotskyite parties. He later rejected them, however, because of their authoritarianism. Unfair treatment and unequal distribution of power and influence angered him. In the psychoanalytic field he encouraged the sharing of the difficulties, pain, joy and fun of group psychotherapeutic work. The need to get things right, the wonder at how interpretations were so often lost and ignored, the question of whether one should be working with the deep unconscious in therapeutic groups or making comments at the overt conscious level were constant themes that he brought to discussions.\nHe died of cancer on 22 December 2002, at the age of 57.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trinity School of John Whitgift", "response": ["*Ian Craib, sociologist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Essex people", "response": ["* Ian Craib - Professor of Sociology (1973\u20132003)"]}, {"page": "Craib, Ian", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Craib"]}, {"page": "Disappointment", "response": ["In 1994, psychotherapist Ian Craib published the book The Importance of Disappointment, in which he drew on the works of Melanie Klein and Sigmund Freud in advancing the theory that disappointment-avoidant culture\u2014particularly therapy culture\u2014provides false expectations of perfection in life and prevents people from achieving a healthy self-identity. Craib offered as two examples litigious victims of medical mistakes, who once would have accepted accidents as a course of life, and people suffering grief following the death of a loved one who, he said, are provided a false stage model of recovery that is more designed to comfort bereavement therapists than the bereaved.Seale, p. 167\u2013168."]}, {"page": "Craib", "response": ["*Ian Craib (1945\u20132002), British sociologist and psychotherapist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2002", "response": ["*Ian Craib, 57, English sociologist and psychotherapist (The Importance of Disappointment)."]}]}}
