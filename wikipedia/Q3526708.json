A right-handed batsman who also bowled part-time right-arm fast, Wood was primarily a wicketkeeper. He was Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1891. Although his batting average across his entire first-class career was 16.94, his Test batting average was 68.00 thanks to scores of 59 and 134* in his final two innings. His average is statistically the highest of any England Test player, however a standard qualification of twenty innings played deducts him from the recognised lists. He was the first wicketkeeper to score a Test century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Wood (disambiguation)", "response": ["Henry Wood (1869\u20131944) was a British conductor.", "Henry Wood may also refer to:", "* Henry Wood (cricketer, born 1853) (1853\u20131919), English cricketer", "* Henry Wood (Somerset cricketer) (1872\u20131950)", "* Henry Wood (architect), architect of Ashton Court outbuildings (1805)", "* Sir Henry Wood, 1st Baronet (1597\u20131671), Member of Parliament of England for Hythe 1661\u201371", "* Henry Wood (minstrel), 19th-century New York City minstrel show manager", "* Ellen Wood (author) (1814\u20131887), writing as Mrs Henry Wood, English novelist", "* Henry Wood, a fictional character in The Adventure of the Crooked Man, a Sherlock Holmes story by Arthur Conan Doyle", "*Henry Woods (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "1890 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Great Wicket-Keepers \u2013 Jack Blackham, Gregor MacGregor, Dick Pilling, Mordecai Sherwin, Henry Wood"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Henry Wood"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Henry Wood"]}, {"page": "1890 English cricket season", "response": ["* Wisden (Five Great Wicket-Keepers) \u2013 Jack Blackham, Gregor MacGregor, Dick Pilling, Mordecai Sherwin, Henry Wood"]}, {"page": "Harry Wood", "response": ["*Henry Wood (cricketer, born 1853) (1853\u20131919), Henry \"Harry\" Wood, English cricketer", "*Henry Wood (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Henry Wood \u00b7"]}, {"page": "History of cricket in South Africa to 1918", "response": ["South Africa won the toss and batted first.
