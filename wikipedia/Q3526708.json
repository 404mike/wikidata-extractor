(1853-1919)", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wood_(cricketer,_born_1853)", "wikipedia_page": {"main": "Henry \"Harry\" Wood (14 December 1853 \u2013 30 April 1919) was an English cricketer who briefly played Test cricket for England, and enjoyed a successful career for Kent and Surrey that spanned the years between 1876 and 1900. A right-handed batsman who also bowled part-time right-arm fast, Wood was primarily a wicketkeeper. He was Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1891. Although his batting average across his entire first-class career was 16.94, his Test batting average was 68.00 thanks to scores of 59 and 134* in his final two innings. His average is statistically the highest of any England Test player, however a standard qualification of twenty innings played deducts him from the recognised lists. He was the first wicketkeeper to score a Test century.", "link_mentions": {}}}
