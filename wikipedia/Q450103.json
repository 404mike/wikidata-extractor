He also gained one cap for the Scotland national team.

Maxwell later coached the Belgian national team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Belgium national football team", "response": ["On 11 October 1900, Beerschot AC honorary president Jorge D\u00edaz announced that Antwerp would host a series of challenge matches between Europe's best football teams. After some organisational problems, on 28 April 1901, Beerschot's pitch hosted its first tournament, in which a Belgian A-squad and a Dutch B-team contested the Coupe Vanden Abeele. Belgium won, and beat the Netherlands in all three follow-up matches; FIFA does not recognise these results because Belgium fielded some English players. On 1 May 1904, the Belgians played their first official match, against France at the Stade du Vivier d'Oie in Uccle; their draw left the \u00c9vence Copp\u00e9e Trophy unclaimed. Twenty days later, the football boards of both countries were among the seven FIFA founders. At that time, the Belgian squad was chosen by a committee drawn from the country's six or seven major clubs. In 1906, the national team players received the nickname Red Devils because of their red jerseys, and four years later, Scottish ex-footballer William Maxwell replaced the UBSSA committee as their manager. From 1912, UBSSA governed football only and was renamed UBSFA. During the Great War, the national team only played unrecognised friendlies, with matches in and against France."]}, {"page": "Cercle Brugge K.S.V.", "response": ["* William Maxwell (1937\u201338)"]}, {"page": "William Maxwell", "response": ["William Maxwell may refer to:", "*William Maxwell (engraver) (c. 1766\u20131809), printer of the Sentinel of the Northwest Territory newspaper in Cincinnati, Ohio", "*William Maxwell (educator) (1784\u20131857), seventh President of Hampden\u2013Sydney College", "*William Maxwell (physician) (1581\u20131641), Scottish physician", "*William Maxwell (Continental Army general) (1733\u20131796), Irish-born American soldier from New Jersey in the American Revolutionary War", "*Sir William Maxwell, 5th Baronet, of Monreith, British MP for Wigtownshire, 1805\u20131812 and 1822\u20131830", "*William Maxwell (Australian politician) (1867\u20131921), gold miner and member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*William Maxwell (co-operator) (1841\u20131929), Scottish co-operative activist", "*William Maxwell (railroad executive) (1794\u20131856), American business executive and politician, president of the Erie Railroad 1842\u20131843", "*William Maxwell (footballer) (1876\u20131940), Scottish footballer, manager of the Belgian national football team", "*William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale (1676\u20131744), Catholic nobleman", "*William Maxwell (journalist) (died 1928), British journalist, soldier, writer and civil servant", "*Charles William Maxwell (1775\u20131848), governor of the British crown colony of Sierra Leone 1811\u20131815"]}]}}
