In the first half of the 20th century she published nearly 50 books of girls' fiction, the vast majority being boarding school stories. She also published numerous short stories in magazines.\nHer books were commercially successful, widely read by pre-adolescent girls, and influenced them. Though interest in girls' school stories waned after World War II, her books remained popular until the 1960s. They were seen as disruptive and a negative influence on moral standards by some figures in authority during the height of their popularity, and in some cases were banned, or indeed burned, by headmistresses in British girls' schools.While her stories have been much imitated in more recent decades, and many of her motifs and plot elements have since become clich\u00e9s or the subject of parody, they were innovative when they first appeared. Brazil made a major contribution to changing the nature of fiction for girls. She presented a young female point of view which was active, aware of current issues and independent-minded; she recognised adolescence as a time of transition, and accepted girls as having common interests and concerns which could be shared and acted upon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Children's literature", "response": ["Important early magazines or story papers for older children were the Boy's Own Paper, published from 1879 to 1967Galactic Central and The Girl's Own Paper published from 1880 until 1956.Galactic Central Other story papers for older boys were The Hotspur (1933 to 1959) and The Rover, which started in 1922 and was absorbed into Adventure in 1961 and The Wizard in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973.British Comics Many prominent authors contributed to the Boy's Own Paper: cricketer W.G.

Auden. Larkin's own attitude to these poems appears equivocal. He expresses pleasure that his friend Bruce Montgomery liked them, especially \"The School in August\".Thwaite, p. 69 However, to Amis he writes: \"I think all wrong-thinking people ought to like them. I used to write them whenever I'd seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl\u00a0... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying\".Thwaite, p. 70 Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin's early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clich\u00e9s. They are an early demonstration of Larkin's talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of \"The School in August\": \"And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey\". In Booth's view the Coleman poems are among the best Larkin wrote in the 1940s, well beyond anything in his first published selection The North Ship (1945).Booth, p. xvii"]}, {"page": "Polperro", "response": ["* Angela Brazil, novelist"]}, {"page": "Arthur Marshall (broadcaster)", "response": ["As Marshall could not find enough acting work, or convince his parents that they should support his desire to pursue a career in the theatre, in 1931 he became a teacher of modern languages, again at Oundle School.
