Published under the name 'G. McLeod Winsor'.\nHis novel Station X (1919) is a novel of the radio age and was noted by H.P. Lovecraft as a \"semi-classic\" in his 1934 essay \u201cSome Notes on Interplanetary Fiction\u201d. The novel narrates a psychic invasion of the Earth from Mars, told much in the manner of Jules Verne. It was later reprinted as a serial in Amazing magazine in 1926, to reader acclaim. Noted author van Vogt singled it out as a key work in the famous Arkham Sampler survey of 1948, but others on the panel did not share his opinion.\nHis The Mysterious Disappearances (1926), re-titled Vanishing Men in 1927, is a series of locked-room type mystery stories, including that of a mad scientist who develops a levitation device with which to kidnap his victims.A final book was Once Bitten (1930), a lively murder mystery involving a military man who finds he has a doppelganger.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1919 in literature", "response": ["*George McLeod Winsor \u2013 Station X"]}, {"page": "Station X", "response": ["*Station X, 1919 novel by George McLeod Winsor"]}, {"page": "Winsor", "response": ["* George McLeod Winsor (1856\u20131939), British writer"]}]}}
