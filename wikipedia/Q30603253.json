The club was formerly the governing body of cricket and still holds considerable global influence.\nIn 1788, the MCC took responsibility for the laws of cricket, issuing a revised version that year. Changes to these Laws are now determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), but the copyright is still owned by MCC. When the ICC was created in 1909, it was administered by the secretary of the MCC, and the president of MCC automatically assumed the chairmanship of ICC until 1989.For much of the 20th century, commencing with the 1903\u201304 tour of Australia and ending with the 1976\u201377 tour of India, MCC organised international tours on behalf of the England cricket team for playing test matches. On these tours, the England team was called MCC in non-international matches. In 1993, its administrative and governance functions were transferred to the ICC and the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB).\nMCC teams are essentially ad hoc because they have never taken part in any formal competition, but have always held first-class status when playing against first-class opposition. To mark the beginning of each English season, MCC plays the reigning county champions.\nThe president of the club is Clare Connor, the first woman president. She was preceded by Kumar Sangakkara, who was the president from May 2019 to October 2021 and the club's first non-British president.", "link_mentions": []}}
