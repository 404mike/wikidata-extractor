Wade was not involved in the 2018 Premier League Darts for the first time since 2014. Wade ended his short stint outside the world's top 10 dart players, making good runs in European tour and players championship events away from the TV screens. Wade hit an 8th career 9-darter in a Pro-tour match against Michael Smith. Throughout the year, Wade had some really good runs on the European Tour reaching the final twice losing both to Michael van Gerwen 8\u20133. Late in the year, Wade clinched the 9th major tournament of his career winning the 2018 European Championship (darts) for the very first time, defeating Simon Whitlock 11\u20138 in the final, having already defeated Martin Schindler, Ricky Evans, Gerwyn Price and Max Hopp in the previous rounds. It was Wade's first major since 2014 and his first ranking major since 2011, propelling him back in to the world's elite top 6. Wade dedicated his title and upturn in form to his new-born son, Arthur, also stating he was \"dangerous\" again and that the rest of the field should \"look out\".", "At the World Series of Darts Finals, Wade defeated debutant Ross Smith 6\u20133 in the first round. He then defeated hometown favorite Mensur Suljovi\u0107 6\u20133 in the second round and Jamie Lewis 10\u20135 in the Quarter-Finals, continuing his excellent stretch of form. It was the first time since 2011 that Wade won 8 consecutive TV major matches. In the Semi-Finals, Wade dispatched 5-time World Champion Raymond van Barneveld 11\u20132 in a high quality affair in which Wade averaged 100 and hit 65% of his doubles. This win stretched Wade's unbeaten TV run to 9 matches, the first time he had achieved this feat since 2008. In the Final, Wade played Michael Smith. Wade got off to a 3-leg advantage but Smith would peg him back to 5\u20135 before the second break. Wade would go onto break Smith in the 19th leg to serve the title out at 10\u20139 but he busted his score of 121, and Smith eventually came back and won the leg. In the decider, Smith missed 5 match darts and Wade sealed the title on D18. The tournament victory was Wade's second major in 7 days, and the 10th of his career. It was also Wade's first World Series Title. Wade's tournament victories sealed his place in the 2018 Grand Slam of Darts where he drew Keegan Brown, Mark Webster and Wesley Harms to comprise Group C. Wade won his opening group match, whitewashing BDO player Wesley Harms 5\u20130 with a 99 average. In his second group game, Wade defeated Keegan Brown 5\u20133, averaging 105. In doing so, Wade set a new personal record of 12 TV major wins in succession. Wade defeated Mark Webster 5\u20131 with a 102 average in the final group match to top the group, extending his unbeaten run to 13 matches and setting up a Round of 16 showdown with Michael Unterbuchner. Wade lost, rather surprisingly, to Michael Unterbuchner 10\u20136.", "Wade defeated Japanese Qualifier Seigo Asada 3\u20132 in the second round of the 2019 PDC World Darts Championship, a high quality, feisty affair in which Wade came under criticism for his celebrations aimed towards Asada. Wade later apologized for his actions. In the third round, Wade would go 0\u20132, and 1\u20133 down to Keegan Brown in a hostile atmosphere before producing a remarkable 4\u20133 comeback win. Wade became the 7th top 10 seed to crash out before the Quarter-Final stage, losing 4\u20133 to Ryan Joyce in the last 16. Wade was picked for the 2019 Premier League Darts on the 10-year anniversary of him winning the event. Wade's Masters campaign began with a 10\u20137 victory of Gerwyn Price. He followed the win with victories over Joe Cullen in the Quarter-Finals and Peter Wright in the Semi-Finals to set up a final with Michael van Gerwen. Wade lost the final 11\u20135 to Van Gerwen. Wade kicked off the 2019 Premier League Darts in style with a 7\u20134 win over outgoing Raymond van Barneveld with a 99 average. In week 4 of the 2019 Premier League Darts he beat Michael van Gerwen 7\u20133 Averaging 95.65. Wade continued his excellent form at the UK Open, dismantling fellow countryman James Wilson (darts player) 10\u20131 in the 4th round. Wade followed up the victory with a 10\u20137 win over Max Hopp but was surprisingly beaten 7\u201310 by Ross Smith in the round of 16. In week 5 of the 2019 Premier League Darts, Wade averaged 110 in his 7\u20130 whitewash win over Daryl Gurney sending him to the summit of the league table. Wade hit a 9-darter in a German Darts Championship match which he lost 5\u20136 to Darren Webster.
