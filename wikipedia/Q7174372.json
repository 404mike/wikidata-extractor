Golden State entered the match in first place by one point with an 8\u20131\u20132 record, losing only at San Diego. ASC San Diego was in second place at 8\u20132\u20131, having lost both their matches against Orange County FC. After Golden State built a 2\u20130 lead, ASC San Diego struck in the 71st, 76th and 79th minutes to win the match, 3\u20132, and claimed the Southwest Conference championship. The first and third goals in ASC San Diego's dramatic comeback were tallied by their leading goalscorer, Amani Walker. Two days later, Orange County, at 7\u20131\u20133, had a chance to claim second place in the Southwest Conference and avoid the play-in game, if they could earn a road win against Riverside Coras USA. The second-place team in the Southwest Conference would also have home-field advantage in the West Region Quarterfinals. Orange County's Peter Gregory scored his second goal of the match in the 76th minute to break a 2\u20132 deadlock that had stood since halftime. However, Coras tied the match five minutes later on an own goal, the second Orange County had conceded in the match, and the game ended in a draw."]}]}}
