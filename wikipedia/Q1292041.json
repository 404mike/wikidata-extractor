P. Elwell-Sutton), In Search of Omar Khayyam, Routledge Library Editions: Iran (2012) One of the earliest specimens of Omar Khayyam's Rubiyat is from Fakhr al-Din Razi. In his work  (ca. 1160), he quotes one of his poems (corresponding to quatrain LXII of FitzGerald's first edition). Daya in his writings (, ca. 1230) quotes two quatrains, one of which is the same as the one already reported by Razi. An additional quatrain is quoted by the historian Juvayni (, ca. 1226\u20131283). In 1340 Jajarmi includes thirteen quatrains of Khayyam in his work containing an anthology of the works of famous Persian poets (), two of which have hitherto been known from the older sources.Edward Denison Ross, Omar Khayyam, Bulletin of the School Of Oriental Studies London Institution (1927) A comparatively late manuscript is the Bodleian MS.

The manuscript belonged to William Ouseley (1767\u20131842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.There are occasional quotes of verses attributed to Omar in texts attributed to authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, but these are of doubtful authenticity, so that skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be pseudepigraphic."]}, {"page": "SOAS University of London", "response": ["Since its foundation, the school has had nine directors.
