He was the first to report observation of electroluminescence from a solid state diode, leading to the discovery of the light-emitting diode. He was a personal assistant to Guglielmo Marconi.\nRound was the eldest child of Joseph and Gertrude Round. He spent his early years in the small town of Kingswinford in Staffordshire and received his early education at Cheltenham Grammar School. He later attended the Royal College of Science, a constituent college of Imperial College London where he gained a first class honours degree.\nRound joined the Marconi Company in 1902; not long after Marconi had made his transatlantic wireless transmission. He was sent to the USA where he experimented with a variety of different aspects of radio technology, focusing on technologies such as powdered iron cored tuning inductors. He also performed some experiments with transmission paths over land and sea at different times of the day and investigated direction finding, for which he used a frame antenna.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Light-emitting diode", "response": ["Electroluminescence as a phenomenon was discovered in 1907 by the English experimenter H. J. Round of Marconi Labs, using a crystal of silicon carbide and a cat's-whisker detector. Russian inventor Oleg Losev reported creation of the first LED in 1927. English translation:   His research was distributed in Soviet, German and British scientific journals, but no practical use was made of the discovery for several decades."]}, {"page": "Vacuum tube", "response": ["Early tubes used the filament as the cathode; this is called a \"directly heated\" tube. Most modern tubes are \"indirectly heated\" by a \"heater\" element inside a metal tube that is the cathode. The heater is electrically isolated from the surrounding cathode and simply serves to heat the cathode sufficiently for thermionic emission of electrons. The electrical isolation allows all the tubes' heaters to be supplied from a common circuit (which can be AC without inducing hum) while allowing the cathodes in different tubes to operate at different voltages. H. J. Round invented the indirectly heated tube around 1913."]}, {"page": "Microphone", "response": ["In 1916, E.C.

The first example to appear in Britain was the Marconi-Osram FE1, which was designed by H. J. Round, and became available in 1920. The tube was intended to be used in a reflex circuit (for example the single-valve ship receiver Type 91) where the same valve performed the multiple functions of RF amplifier, AF amplifier, and diode detector.  The RF signal was applied to one control grid, and the AF signal to the other.  This type of tetrode was used in many imaginative ways in the period before the appearance of the screen-grid valve revolutionised receiver design.", "In the screen grid tube, a grid referred to as the screen grid, shield grid or sometimes accelerating grid is inserted between the control grid and the anode. The screen grid provides an electrostatic shield between the control grid and the anode, reducing the capacitance between them to a very small amount.Henney, K., Richardson, G. A. (1952) Principles of Radio, 6th ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons. pp. 279 - 282 The first screen grid valve was patented by Hiroshi Ando in 1919 and developmental versions were built by N. H.

Some of these stations also acted as 'Y' stations to collect German messages, but a new section was created within Room 40 to plot the positions of ships from the directional reports. No attempts were made by the German fleet to restrict its use of wireless until 1917, and then only in response to perceived British use of direction finding, not because it believed messages were being decoded."]}, {"page": "Round (surname)", "response": ["* H.
