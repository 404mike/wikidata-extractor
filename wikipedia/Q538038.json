They find a large house in the woods, where the housekeeper Mrs Ardoy (Diana Dors) welcomes them and offers them shelter for the night. Mrs Ardoy has a large family of children, some of whom are her stepchildren and some are fostered. She speaks about her husband often but he is never seen. All of the children are strange - they sleep at odd times, are afraid of fire, roam the woods in the dark, and become disoriented as dusk approaches. Framed pictures of various women in the house are also seen, apparently the mothers of the various children. Tom goes back to their car to collect some things, but is attacked by a half-human creature covered in fur with yellow eyes. When he returns to the house, he and Sarah hear howling coming from the woods. Later that night in their room, Sarah is horrified when she sees the face of a werewolf at the window. Finding their bedroom door locked, Tom climbs out of the window to investigate but falls while climbing the drainpipe. Meanwhile, the werewolf enters their bedroom through the house and attacks Sarah as Mrs Ardoy and the children watch in delight."]}, {"page": "Agatha (film)", "response": ["* Celia Gregory as Nancy Neele"]}, {"page": "Reilly, Ace of Spies", "response": ["* Celia Gregory as Nadina \"Nadia\" Massino (wife #2)"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Celia Gregory, Rosy Clayton, Donald Morley, Barrie Cookson, Godfrey James, Peter Childs"]}, {"page": "List of The Professionals episodes", "response": ["| Celia Gregory, Sylvestra Le Touzel, David John, Nigel Pegram"]}, {"page": "Gregory (surname)", "response": ["* Celia Gregory"]}, {"page": "Stanley Ellin", "response": ["*1981 - \"Kindly Dig Your Own Grave\" - Adapted by Robin Chapman for Tales of the Unexpected, 14 June 1981 (Season 4, Episode 11), starring Micheline Presle, Robert H.
