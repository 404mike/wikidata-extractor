One critic writes that \"Tucker sounds like he\u2019s following a tradition that has long been neglected, focusing not on ageless songs and ideas but on ageless feelings captured through his droning miasma of acoustic guitar and mandolin.\" His first musical position was singing in hardcore band Suction in the early 1990s, who according to Tucker \"played noisy adolescent punk with leanings towards Swans and Fugazi.\" His next job was as vocalist of post-rock hardcore 5-piece Unhome who released one album Short History of Houses (Unlabel) and a split single with Papa M. Unhome split in late 1999 and Tucker went on to tour the UK with Detroit space-rockers Fuxa, playing guitar synthesizers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen O'Malley", "response": ["O'Malley is a founding member of several bands including Sunn O))) (1998\u2013present), Thorr's Hammer (1994\u20131995), Burning Witch (1995\u20131998), KTL (2005\u2013present), and Khanate (2000\u20132006).
