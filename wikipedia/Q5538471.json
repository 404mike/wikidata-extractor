His career spanned the 1789 to 1793 seasons and he played mainly for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), of which he was an early member.  Dehaney was a prolific player in the 1793 season and appeared in ten of the 17 first-class matches recorded but, curiously, that was his last season.\nDehaney was primarily a batsman who made 16 known appearances in first-class cricket matches and scored a total of 173 runs in 28 innings with a highest score of 39.  He rarely bowled and is credited with just one wicket.  He made only 5 catches, which suggests he was an outfielder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|George Dehaney"]}, {"page": "Dehaney, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Dehaney"]}]}}
