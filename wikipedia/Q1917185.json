Maurice's girlfriend, Vera Parkinson, was played by Rosemary Martin in the first series. In the second and third series (during which Maurice and Vera marry), Vera was played by Lynda Baron.

Froggitt is on the committee of his local working men's club, serving as concert secretary in charge of booking \"turns\". Froggitt's colleagues on the committee are the dour Scouser Jack (Bill Dean), Harry (Harold Goodwin) and excitable, stereotypical Welshman Clive (Richard Davies), often referred to as Taff by Selwyn. All decisions taken by the club committee are taken on a \"show of hands...\" and \"carried unanimously\". In keeping with the A Midsummer Night's Dream characterisations, Maynard saw the committee as the mechanicals. Froggitt is incompetent at everything he turns his hand to, being equally inept at his day job (digging holes and filling them in), do-it-yourself at home, and booking acts for the club. Nevertheless, he is honest and hard-working, unlike the other committee members, who usually sit back in comfort while Froggitt does the manual labour. They generally tolerate him because he is prepared to volunteer for unwanted tasks. Barman at the club is Raymond (Ray Mort), often seen answering the telephone with a number of highly fictitious and fanciful addresses."]}, {"page": "Clarence Derwent Awards", "response": ["* 1957 Megs Jenkins as Beatrice in A View from the Bridge"]}, {"page": "1998 in Wales", "response": ["*5 October \u2013 Megs Jenkins, actress, 81"]}, {"page": "The Befrienders", "response": ["The series dealt with the work of the Samaritans organisation, and the individual cases its staff came across.
