Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated \"alpha\", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which \"place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups\". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an \"omega\" taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a \"beta\" taxonomy."]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1958: Sir Gavin de Beer and William Bertram Turrill"]}, {"page": "Henry John Elwes", "response": ["Shortly before his death in 1922, Elwes asked Arthur Grove, a friend and fellow lily expert, to undertake the task of producing a supplement.

Its currently accepted name, Justicia flaviflora was coined by the American botanist Dieter C. Wasshausen in 1995, reflecting the predominant view that the members of the genus Beloperone should actually be considered members of the genus Justicia.  As of 2006, the species was last known to have been collected in 1993.  Collections of J. flaviflora are known to exist in the herbaria of the British Museum and at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|William Bertram Turrill||20/03/1958||14 June 1890 \u2013 15 December 1961"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (T\u2013V)", "response": ["* Turrill \u2013 William Bertram Turrill (1890\u20131961)"]}, {"page": "Sempervivum altum", "response": ["Sempervivum altum is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to the Caucasus Mountains.
