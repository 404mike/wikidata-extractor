En route to the UEFA Cup final, they defeated Juventus and Ferencv\u00e1ros before losing to Tottenham Hotspur 3\u20132 on aggregate; a 2\u20131 home defeat in the first leg proving decisive. Wolves lifted silverware two years later when they won the League Cup for the first time by beating Manchester City 2\u20131 in the final. Despite relegation again in 1976, Wolves bounced back at the first attempt as Second Division champions under manager Sammy Chung, and then under manager John Barnwell, the turn of the decade saw them finish in the top six in the league and win the 1980 League Cup, when then-record signing Andy Gray scored the only goal of the final to defeat the reigning European champions and League Cup holders Nottingham Forest."]}, {"page": "Ipswich Town F.C.", "response": ["Ramsey was replaced by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch plummeted. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich slipped down to the Second Division in 1964, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games \u2013 one of the worst-ever defensive records in English senior football. Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by Bill McGarry in 1964. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant Sammy Chung in the 1967\u201368 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers. McGarry left to manage Wolves and was replaced by Bobby Robson in January 1969."]}, {"page": "Ethnicity and association football", "response": ["Players of Oriental origin have had presence in European football. Hong Y 'Frank' Soo played 9 times for England during the Second World War. Sammy Chung coached Wolverhampton Wanderers to a UEFA Cup Final in 1972, and later as manager helped lead them to promotion from the old 2nd division to the old 1st division. Vikash Dhorasoo, of Indo-Mauritian descent, played for the French national team during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. South Korean Park Ji-Sung, who played for Manchester United, is an example of an Asian footballer who can be a rising star in big clubs in Europe. Park may be preceded by the Japanese player Hidetoshi Nakata, who played at various European clubs such as Perugia, AS Roma, Parma, Bologna, Fiorentina and lately at Bolton Wanderers. Another Japanese player, Shunsuke Nakamura, overcame criticism of his lack of pace and stamina, and helped seal Celtic FC's 2006-2007 Scottish Premier League season title. The most prominent example of an Asian player having a successful career in a big European League in the 20th century was Cha Bum-Kun, a Korean striker who played for Darmstadt, Frankfurt and Leverkusen in the German league, scoring 98 goals in 308 matches in Germany. He was later given the title Asia's Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics. Other Korean, Iranian, Chinese and Japanese football players have also gained starting places in their respective clubs in Europe. Some football clubs hire the Asian football stars hoping to increase merchandise sales from the player's respective Asian country. However, in Britain in 2007, there were complaints of a lack of Asian participants in top league football.Sunday Times, 2007-01-14, Joe Lovejoy, \"Where are the Asian players?\""]}, {"page": "Mick Mills", "response": ["In 1985, Mills became player-manager of Stoke City with Sammy Chung as his assistant. Mills joined Stoke with the club a very poor position having just been relegated from the First Division with a record low points tally and with little money available. He sent about trying to restore some pride into the support and began well as Stoke beat Leeds United 6\u20132 on the third match of the 1985\u201386. Money was still a major problem so he sold Mark Chamberlain to Portsmouth for \u00a3300,000 but typical of the financial climate at Stoke the money was used to reduce the club's overdraft. Results slowly improved and Stoke finished the season in 10th place in what was a season of recovery. More player sales followed in 1986\u201387 but the arrival of Peter Coates as chairman allowed for some new players to arrive most notably Lee Dixon, Nicky Morgan and former Ipswich teammate Brian Talbot. Morale was boosted again thanks to another large win over Leeds United (7\u20132) as Stoke climbed up the table into the play-offs. However their form could not be maintained and they had to settle for 8th position."]}, {"page": "Bill McGarry", "response": ["Just months into the 1968\u201369 campaign, he walked out on Ipswich (who appointed Bobby Robson in his stead) to take charge at fellow First Division club Wolverhampton Wanderers, who had just sacked his former teammate Ronnie Allen. He appointed Sammy Chung as his assistant, who he had previously taken on at Ipswich. He built a team around speedy winger Dave Wagstaffe, central midfield duo Mike Bailey and Kenny Hibbitt, and strike partners Derek Dougan and John Richards.", "They again qualified for Europe following a fifth-place finish in 1972\u201373, and McGarry also led the club to the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and League Cup. They were beaten 1\u20130 by Leeds United at Maine Road in the FA Cup, and lost 4\u20133 on aggregate to Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup. They dropped to 12th place in 1973\u201374, but finally won a major trophy after beating Manchester City 2\u20131 in the League Cup final at Wembley. He later admitted that he would have resigned had Wolves lost in the final. Wolves dropped back down to 12th in 1974\u201375, though they did record a 7\u20131 win over Chelsea at Molineux. However the club suffered relegation at the end of the 1975\u201376 season, and McGarry was promptly fired after nearly eight years at the helm. He was replaced by long-time assistant Sammy Chung."]}, {"page": "Gary Brabin", "response": ["Brabin departed Canal Street and made a return to the Football League after being signed by Doncaster Rovers manager Sammy Chung for a \u00a345,000 fee in July 1994. He also played three games for the England C team against Wales, Finland and Norway. He went on to score eight goals from 33 appearances for \"Donny\" throughout the 1994\u201395 season. He added three goals from 34 games in the 1995\u201396 campaign, before he left Belle Vue and was moved on to Stan Ternent's Bury for a \u00a3125,000 fee in March 1996.
