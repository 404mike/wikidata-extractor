He trained as a barrister before becoming a journalist and then a non-fiction writer. His second book Dunkirk: Fight to the Last Man was published in 2006. His previous book is Enigma: The Battle for the Code, the story of breaking the German Enigma machine code at Bletchley Park during the Second World War (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2000). His family owned Bletchley Park until they sold it to the British government in 1938.\nIn 2016, Somme: Into the Breach appeared in time for the 100th anniversary of the Somme Offensive. Cecil Sebag-Montefiore, the author's great-grandfather, took his own life after serving with the Royal Engineers on the Western Front.He has been married since 1989 to Aviva Burnstock, the head of the Department of Art Conservation & Technology at the Courtauld Institute in London. His brother Simon Sebag Montefiore is also a writer, besides being an historian.

In response, Anglo-French armies moved into Belgium in accordance with the Allied Dyle Plan. The division reached the River Dyle without difficulties. Although the division achieved tactical success in its first action on 15 May, strategic developments forced the BEF withdraw the next day. The division retreated  within 27 hours. As the strategic situation grew worse, several divisions were ordered to form a cordon around the BEF's line of retreat. The La Bass\u00e9e Canal and the river Aa, in France, were the only defensible positions that covered the BEF's southern and western flank. The 2nd\u00a0Division defended part of the canal and engaged in several actions on 25\u201326\u00a0May. On 26\u00a0May, with the majority of the BEF bound within a closing perimeter on the French coast and lacking the ability to hold the position, the decision was made to evacuate from Dunkirk, the only remaining port in British hands. The 2nd\u00a0Division was ordered to maintain its position at the canal, to allow other formations to retreat. Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, a historian, wrote this was \"the most difficult assignment handed to any unit in the BEF\" and that the difficulty of this task \"can be gauged by the small number of soldiers who returned home\". On 28\u00a0May, the 2nd Division was assailed by the 3rd and 7th Panzer Divisions, the SS Division Totenkopf, and also came under air attack. The heavy fighting saw the 2nd Division reduced from 13,000 men to around 2,500, those who were not killed were taken prisoner by the Germans. By the time the 5th Brigade's 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders was evacuated, it had been reduced to 79 men. To this point in the campaign, this was the highest number of casualties suffered by a single battalion within the BEF. After the fighting had ended, 97 members of the 2nd Division were murdered in the Le Paradis massacre. Lionel Ellis, who wrote the volume focused on the BEF in France for the History of the Second World War, stated the division \"had indeed sacrificed itself to keep open the line of retirement\", delayed the Germans, and ensured French formations were not trapped. During the night 28/29\u00a0May, the division withdrew into the Dunkirk perimeter, from where it evacuated."]}, {"page": "Hans-Thilo Schmidt", "response": ["After the Battle of France, the French agent who had been Schmidt's case officer, a German citizen named Stallmann who went by the name \"Rodolphe Lemoine\" (fr) and used the codename \"Rex,\" was arrested by the Gestapo and betrayed Schmidt as a French spy.

At this point, a composite battery of eleven field guns and two  howitzers were assigned to the division, coming from a Royal Artillery (RA) training camp near Arras. Most of the guns lacked the required equipment for indirect fire and could only be fired over open sights; some had no sights at all. The division soon encountered the vanguard of the German force, who did not attempt to force the canal in the division's area. With Germans nearby, the order was given to blow the bridges across the canal that included one bridge being destroyed while refugees were still crossing. During the day, an alleged spy was brought to the headquarters of the 1st Battalion, Tyneside Scottish. The individual was briefly interrogated by Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Swinburne and the battalion's French liaison officer before a summary execution was carried out by Sergeant Dick Chambers.
