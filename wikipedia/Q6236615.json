He occupied the right-half position during the first half of the season, but lost his place to new arrival Joe Robson and rarely regained it. At the end of the campaign, he moved on to Scunthorpe & Lindsey United of the Midland League, where he spent two years before returning to Durham City in 1926. As backup to John Gurkin at centre half, he rarely appeared, and went back to non-league football with West Stanley and Jarrow."]}, {"page": "Gurkin, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Gurkin"]}]}}
