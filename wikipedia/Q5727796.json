He worked as an assistant to Henry Payne chiefly as a stained-glass artist, until 1912, when he moved to London, where he shared lodgings with fellow Birmingham student, Gerald Brockhurst.Rushbury was an official war artist during World War I, and took up etching and drypoint under the influence of Francis Dodd before studying briefly under Henry Tonks at the Slade School of Art in 1921.He was elected a member of the New English Art Club in 1917, the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers in 1921, the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1922, and the Royal Academy in 1936. \n\nIn 1940 he was again appointed an official war artist until 1945. \nAround  1943 the owner of a Port Glasgow shipyard, James Lithgow, complained to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, about Stanley Spencer's portrayal of his shipyard. WAAC duly commissioned Rushbury to go to Port Glasgow and produce some rather more conventional views of shipbuilding for Lithgow.In 1949, he was elected Keeper of the Royal Academy and Head of the Royal Academy Schools, a post he held until 1964. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1964 New Year Honours.\nThere is a memorial to Rushbury in St James's Church, Piccadilly, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Sir Henry Rushbury (1889\u20131968)"]}, {"page": "Harborne", "response": ["* Henry Rushbury (painter and etcher)"]}, {"page": "Stanley Spencer", "response": ["Between trips to Port Glasgow, Spencer was renting a room in Epsom, to be near Carline and his children, but the landlady there disliked him and he wanted to move back to Cookham and work on the paintings in his old studio but he could not afford to rent it from Preece, so WAAC agreed further financial help for that purpose. In May 1942, Spencer delivered Template, followed by twelve portraits of Clydesiders in October 1942. By June 1943 Spencer was having problems with the composition of the next painting in the series, Bending the Keel plate and considered abandoning it. Although he was not entirely happy with the painting, WAAC purchased it in October 1943 for 150 guineas. About this time, the owner of the shipyard, James Lithgow, complained to WAAC about Spencer's portrayal of his shipyard. WAAC duly commissioned Henry Rushbury to go to Port Glasgow and produce some rather more conventional views of shipbuilding for Lithgow. Spencer made further visits to Glasgow and by June 1944 had completed Riggers and begun work on Plumbers. After WAAC had purchased these two paintings, they did not have enough funds to authorise the completion of the entire original scheme of paintings. By the time WAAC was wound up, money had been made available for one further picture, The Furnaces, which would become the central piece of the scheme. After the war, when the WAAC collection of artworks was dispersed to different museums, the complete Shipbuilding on the Clyde series was offered to the National Maritime Museum who refused to accept the pictures and they were given to the Imperial War Museum instead."]}, {"page": "War artist", "response": ["* Henry Rushbury, KCVO RA 1898\u20131968", "*Henry Rushbury, 1889\u20131968"]}, {"page": "St James's Church, Piccadilly", "response": ["* Sir Henry Rushbury, painter and etcher."]}, {"page": "John Copnall", "response": ["Initially Copnall started his painting studies under the tutelage of his father at the Sir John Cass School of Art in the City of London and from 1949 under the artist Sir Henry Rushbury at the Royal Academy School.Jerry Knight, All About Horsham Magazine, Article on Bainbridge Copnall, May 2013 His early work was largely figurative and he won Turner Gold Medal for Landscape Painting in his final year in 1954.
