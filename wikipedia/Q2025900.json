He joined Premier League club Everton for around \u00a33 million in January 2013 and amassed 95 appearances over four seasons. In August 2016, he signed for Manchester City for an initial \u00a347.5 million with add-ons. He won the Premier League in 2018, 2019 and 2021, the EFL Cup in 2018 and 2020, and the FA Cup in 2019.\nStones made his senior debut for England in May 2014 after previously being capped by England youth teams at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels.

The team also continued its good results before the World Cup, with a draw with Turkey and Portugal, with the same score 2\u20132, in addition to a difficult defeat against Spain 1\u20130 in the 85th minute. Despite this, in the World Cup, the performance of the team did not rise to the expected level, and was once again eliminated from the group stage. The first match against England, the two teams had met in two matches, including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, an England 2\u20130 victory. England scored in the 11th minute when Mouez Hassen stopped a John Stones' header from a corner from the left, but could not save a Harry Kane follow-up from close range. Hassen was substituted four minutes later for Farouk Ben Mustapha due to an injury earlier in the game, after he had a collision with Jesse Lingard. Lingard then mishit a volley from Ashley Young's cross to the far post. After 10 minutes, Ferjani Sassi equalised from the penalty spot after Kyle Walker was penalised for an elbow on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Kane had an appeal for a penalty waved away within five minutes of the restart as he was seemingly impeded by a pair of Tunisia players at a corner. In the additional time, Harry Maguire flicked a Kieran Trippier corner from the right into the path of Kane, who headed it inside the goal after being left free at the back post.The second match against Belgium, the two teams had faced each other in three matches, including one game at the 2002 FIFA World Cup group stage, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Just 6 minutes into the game, Syam Ben Youssef's late challenge on Eden Hazard was deemed, with the use of VAR, to have been just inside the area and he stepped up to score the penalty into the bottom-left corner. Ten minutes later, Dries Mertens won possession just inside the Tunisia half before driving forward and passing the ball to Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku then shot a low strike across Farouk Ben Mustapha into the bottom-right corner. Wahbi Khazri's free-kick from the left was met by Dylan Bronn, who flashed a header past Thibaut Courtois. Thomas Meunier found Lukaku inside the area, which he clipped over the onrushing Mustapha. Toby Alderweireld's long pass from defence was taken on the chest by Hazard, who then rounded Mustapha to stroke into an empty net. Michy Batshuayi met Youri Tielemans' cross at the back post with a controlled half-volley to score Belgium's 5th. Khazri scored deep into stoppage time after a swivel in the box. Tunisia, it has registered as their worst defeat ever in their World Cup history."]}, {"page": "Sylvain Distin", "response": ["On 24 January 2013, Distin signed a new one-year contract with Everton, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2014.

Distin's centre back partnership with Phil Jagielka remained Everton's first choice through the 2013\u201314 season, despite the emergence of John Stones, with the club finishing fifth with their record Premier League points tally of 72.

As was the case 12 months earlier, City came out on top, this time in a single-legged game, winning 2\u20130 at Old Trafford thanks to goals from John Stones and Fernandinho to reach their ninth EFL Cup final, fourth consecutive final, and sixth in the previous eight seasons. Fifty-two weeks after United's 2\u20130 league win in March 2020, which was their last match to be watched by spectators before the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the two met again.

In the January transfer window, Barnsley accepted a bid from Blackpool for Wiseman. However, the deal fell through. Though he rejected the move, Wiseman has increasingly become very unpopular among Barnsley supporters over his performance. Despite this, Wiseman continued to retain their place following newly appointed manager David Flitcroft used Wiseman as a right wing back due to the \u00a33 million sale of youngster John Stones to Everton. In comparison to his somewhat average performances as a centre half under the Hill regime, Wiseman made the right wing back position his own and became an integral part of the 2013 Reds side that narrowly avoided relegation to League One.

He had previously criticised Manchester City and England centre-back John Stones on Twitter, saying he'd \"get 40 a season\" playing against Stones every week, and after the game tweeted that \"I was completely wrong and bang out of order to say I'd score 40 a season..... it's more like 50.\" The following month he was named in Port Vale's best XI of the 2010s by local newspaper The Sentinel. On 5 January, he tweeted a World War III prediction that \"We invade Iran then Cuba then North Korea then the Rothchilds are crowned champions of every bank on the planet\"; the FA concluded that these remarks amounted to Antisemitic canard and handed him a \u00a33,500 fine and a six game ban to start at the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season.
