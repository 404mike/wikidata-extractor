Prisoner Sirius Black has escaped the wizard prison Azkaban, and is supposedly ready to attack Harry in Hogwarts. The game begins on the Hogwarts Express, ignoring the events at Harry's home. Upon reaching Hogwarts, the trio follow the events of the novel, and learn magic by attending classes."]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)", "response": ["The game follows the events and characters of novel, and film, with the player controlling Harry Potter (voiced by Daniel Larner), Hermione Granger (Harper Marshall), and Ron Weasley (Gregg Chillin). The game uses an improved version of the group casting mechanic found in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Improved graphics mean the characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. Gameplay in the Goblet of Fire is much more action-orientated, which is a change from the puzzle and adventure elements found in previous games of the series."]}]}}
