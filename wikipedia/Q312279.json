One of his low points as Chancellor was in 1968 when Nazi-hunter Beate Klarsfeld, who campaigned with her husband Serge Klarsfeld against Nazi criminals, publicly slapped him in the face during the 1968 Christian Democrat convention, while calling him a Nazi. She did so in French and \u2013 whilst being dragged out of the room by two ushers \u2013 repeated her words in German saying \"Kiesinger! Nazi! Abtreten!\" (\"Kiesinger! Nazi! Step down!\") Kiesinger, holding his left cheek, did not respond. Up to his death he refused to comment on the incident and in other opportunities he denied explicitly that he had been opportunistic by joining the NSDAP in 1933 (although he admitted to joining the German Foreign Ministry to dodge his 1940 draft by the Wehrmacht). Other prominent critics included the writers Heinrich B\u00f6ll and G\u00fcnter Grass (in 1966, Grass had written an open letter urging Kiesinger not to accept the chancellorship)."]}, {"page": "20th century", "response": ["* Civil wars occurred in many nations.
