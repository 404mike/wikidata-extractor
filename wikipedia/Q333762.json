This field of study was introduced in 1845 by Italian chemist Francesco SelmiFrancesco Selmi, Studi sulla dimulsione di cloruro d'argento, Nuovi Annali delle Scienze Naturali di Bologna, fasc. di agosto 1845. and further investigated since 1861 by Scottish scientist Thomas Graham.Graham coined the term \"colloid\" in 1861.

In the late 1920s, two Austrian-born scientists, Friedrich Paneth and Kurt Peters, originally reported the transformation of hydrogen into helium by nuclear catalysis when hydrogen was absorbed by finely divided palladium at room temperature. However, the authors later retracted that report, saying that the helium they measured was due to background from the air."]}, {"page": "December 21", "response": ["*1805 \u2013 Thomas Graham, Scottish chemist and academic (d. 1869)"]}, {"page": "Fick's laws of diffusion", "response": ["* his now well-known laws governing the transport of mass through diffusive means.  Fick's work was inspired by the earlier experiments of Thomas Graham, which fell short of proposing the fundamental laws for which Fick would become famous. Fick's law is analogous to the relationships discovered at the same epoch by other eminent scientists: Darcy's law (hydraulic flow), Ohm's law (charge transport), and Fourier's Law (heat transport)."]}, {"page": "Joseph Lister", "response": ["Lister left school in the spring of 1844 when he was seventeen. He was unable to attend either Oxford or the University of Cambridge owing to the religious tests that effectively barred him. Lister decided to attend the non-sectarian University College London Medical School, one of only a few institutions which accepted Quakers at that time. He initially studied arts, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in classics and botany in 1847. While he was studying, Lister suffered from a bout of smallpox, a year after his elder brother died of the disease. The bereavement combined with the stress of his classes led to a nervous breakdown. Lister decided to take a long holiday in Ireland, to recuperate and this delayed the start of his medical studies at the university. In October 1848, Lister registered as a medical student. While a student, Lister developed a lifelong interest in histology and experimental physiology.  During his studies, Lister was active in the University Debating Society and the Hospital Medical Society. His main lecturers were John Lindley, Thomas Graham, Robert Edmond Grant, George Viner Ellis and William Benjamin Carpenter but although Lister often spoke about Lindley and Graham in his writings, it was Wharton Jones and William Sharpey who exercised the greatest influence on Lister. As part of his studies, Lister trained first as an intern and then house physician to Walter Hayle Walshe. Then in 1851, in his second year, Lister became a house surgeon, i.e., a dresser, to John Eric Erichsen. It was while Lister worked for Erichsen that his interest in the healing of wounds began."]}, {"page": "Michael Faraday", "response": ["Faraday's earliest chemical work was as an assistant to Humphry Davy. Faraday was specifically involved in the study of chlorine; he discovered two new compounds of chlorine and carbon. He also conducted the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon that was first pointed out by John Dalton. The physical importance of this phenomenon was more fully revealed by Thomas Graham and Joseph Loschmidt. Faraday succeeded in liquefying several gases, investigated the alloys of steel, and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of these heavy glasses subsequently became historically important; when the glass was placed in a magnetic field Faraday determined the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light. This specimen was also the first substance found to be repelled by the poles of a magnet."]}, {"page": "Polymer", "response": ["The chemical manipulation of polymers dates back to the 19th century, although at the time the nature of these species was not understood. The behaviour of polymers was initially rationalised according to the theory proposed by Thomas Graham which considered them as colloidal aggregates of small molecules held together by unknown forces."]}, {"page": "Joseph Priestley", "response": ["Many of the friends that Priestley made in Birmingham were members of the Lunar Society, a group of manufacturers, inventors, and natural philosophers who assembled monthly to discuss their work. The core of the group included men such as the manufacturer Matthew Boulton, the chemist and geologist James Keir, the inventor and engineer James Watt, and the botanist, chemist, and geologist William Withering. Priestley was asked to join this unique society and contributed much to the work of its members.Schofield (2004), 151\u201352; for an analysis of Priestley's contributions to each man's work, see Schofield's chapter \"Science and the Lunar Society\"; see also Jackson, 200\u201301; Gibbs, 141\u201347; Thorpe, 93\u2013102; Holt, 127\u201332; Uglow, 349\u201350; for a history of the Lunar Society, see Uglow. As a result of this stimulating intellectual environment, he published several important scientific papers, including \"Experiments relating to Phlogiston, and the seeming Conversion of Water into Air\" (1783). The first part attempts to refute Lavoisier's challenges to his work on oxygen; the second part describes how steam is \"converted\" into air. After several variations of the experiment, with different substances as fuel and several different collecting apparatuses (which produced different results), he concluded that air could travel through more substances than previously surmised, a conclusion \"contrary to all the known principles of hydrostatics\".Qtd. in Schofield (2004), 167 This discovery, along with his earlier work on what would later be recognised as gaseous diffusion, would eventually lead John Dalton and Thomas Graham to formulate the kinetic theory of gases.Schofield (2004), 168; see also Jackson 203\u201308; Gibbs, 154\u201361; Uglow, 358\u201361."]}, {"page": "Gel", "response": ["By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids because of a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinking within the fluid that gives a gel its structure (hardness) and contributes to the adhesive stick (tack). In this way, gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid medium. The word gel was coined by 19th-century Scottish chemist Thomas Graham by clipping from gelatine."]}, {"page": "Dialysis", "response": ["*Thomas Graham (chemist), the founder of dialysis and father of colloid chemistry"]}, {"page": "List of chemists", "response": ["*Thomas Graham (1805\u20131869), Scottish chemist, dialysis and diffusion"]}, {"page": "Graham's law", "response": ["Graham's law of effusion (also called Graham's law of diffusion) was formulated by Scottish physical chemist Thomas Graham in 1848.Keith J.

The family was fairly middle class with strong academic roots in University of St Andrews (his grandfather being Rev Prof James Playfair). All of Playfair's siblings were sent back to Scotland to avoid the hazards of an Indian upbringing. Playfair was named after his uncle, Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair, and was educated at the University of St Andrews, the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow, and the University of Edinburgh. After going to Calcutta at the end of 1837, he became private laboratory assistant to Thomas Graham at University College, London, and in 1839 went to work under Justus Liebig at the University of Giessen."]}]}}
