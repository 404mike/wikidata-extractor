In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, created by the social environment. The management of the problem requires social action and it is the collective responsibility of society to create a society in which limitations for disabled people are minimal. Disability is both cultural and ideological in creation. According to the social model, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights concern. The social model of disability has come under criticism. While recognizing the importance played by the social model in stressing the responsibility of society, scholars, including Tom Shakespeare, point out the limits of the model and urge the need for a new model that will overcome the \"medical vs. social\" dichotomy. The limitations of this model mean that often the vital services and information persons with disabilities face are simply not available, often due to limited economic returns in supporting them."]}, {"page": "Oliver Sacks", "response": ["Sacks sometimes faced criticism in the medical and disability studies communities. Arthur K. Shapiro, for instance, an expert on Tourette syndrome, said Sacks's work was \"idiosyncratic\" and relied too much on anecdotal evidence in his writings.Kushner (2000), p. 204 Researcher Makoto Yamaguchi thought Sacks's mathematical explanations, in his study of the numerically gifted savant twins (in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat), were irrelevant, and questioned Sacks's methods. Although Sacks has been characterised as a \"compassionate\" writer and doctor, others have felt that he exploited his subjects. Sacks was called \"the man who mistook his patients for a literary career\" by British academic and disability rights activist Tom Shakespeare, and one critic called his work \"a high-brow freak show\". Sacks responded, \"I would hope that a reading of what I write shows respect and appreciation, not any wish to expose or exhibit for the thrill... but it's a delicate business.\""]}, {"page": "Gateshead", "response": ["* Sir Tom Shakespeare - baronet, sociologist and disability rights campaigner "]}, {"page": "Radley College", "response": ["*Tom Shakespeare, sociologist and broadcaster."]}, {"page": "Disability studies", "response": ["* Tom Shakespeare", "* Corker, Mairian and Tom Shakespeare.

According to Michael Lapidge, From the mid-1980s onward, the combined number of undergraduate and graduate students reached (which might be described as) a critical mass, with the result that there was a very palpable surge in corporate spirit and concomitant pride in being an 'ASNaC', a member of a small but elite group of students distinguished throughout the University for its academic attainments. The Society organises a weekly 'ASNaC Lunch', field trips, punting expeditions, dinners, and ASNaC mugs and sweatshirts.Michel Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in H.
