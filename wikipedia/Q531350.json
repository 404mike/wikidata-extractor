The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a found object, which has not needed artistic skill in its production. Tracey Emin is seen as a leading YBA and a neo-conceptualist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression.

The foundation of this collection was laid in the early years under the director Friedrich Deneken. The aim was to provide an overview of the artistic development of the 19th century with individual sheets. But the first posters were also purchased for the international poster collection, which today numbers over 1000 sheets. In 1923, the collection expanded abruptly with the acquisition of the model collection of the Deutsches Museum f\u00fcr Kunst in Handel und Gewerbe. This included designs by Peter Behrens, Henry van de Velde, the  and the Wiener Werkst\u00e4ttes. At the same time, an extensive collection of Japanese woodblock prints was created. In the 1920s, prints by Heinrich Campendonk, Erich Heckel, K\u00e4the Kollwitz and Franz Marc joined the collection. Even after the Second World War, special attention was paid to the graphic arts collection. For example, the art museums have 80 prints by Picasso as well as works by Warhol, Beuys and Matisse. In the 1980s, works by Gerhard Richter, Nicola De Maria, Abraham David Christian, Mimmo Paladino, A. R. Penck and Norbert Prangenberg were added. In the 1990s, graphic works by artists such as Christian Boltanski, Bethan Huws, Anri Sala or Luc Tuymans entered the collection."]}]}}
