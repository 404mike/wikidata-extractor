He was born in Crook.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Stephenson (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roy Stephenson"]}, {"page": "1962 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["This was Ipswich's first appearance in the Charity Shield while Tottenham Hotspur were making their fourth, having last competed for the trophy the previous season.  Tottenham's Jimmy Greaves opened the scoring and Bobby Smith doubled his team's advantage before half time.  Greaves scored a second 13 minutes into the second half, and late goals from John White and Terry Medwin came either side of a Roy Stephenson consolation goal for Ipswich.", "The match kicked off in sunny, breezy conditions, at 3\u00a0p.m. at Portman Road in front of a crowd of 20,067 and was refereed by Ken Dagnall.  Ipswich were in charge early on in the match and saw an early chance from Crawford go wide as he failed to convert Jimmy Leadbetter's cross.  Ipswich's Inside forwards were covering a lot of ground in both attack and defence, and this soon took its toll as Tottenham remained patient and took the lead through Greaves in the 36th minute.  Peter Baker's pass to Bobby Smith was flicked into space for Greaves to run on and shoot past Ipswich's goalkeeper Roy Bailey.  Five minutes later Smith's backheel from a Greaves pass deceived Ipswich defender Andy Nelson, and Smith doubled Tottenham's lead, who went in 2\u20130 at half-time.  The second half saw Tottenham's veteran defensive midfielder Danny Blanchflower move up the pitch and provided space for his forwards, with John White's pass allowing Greaves to slip the ball past Bailey for 3\u20130.  An injury to Ipswich defender Larry Carberry left the East Anglian club even weaker; Greaves beat five players only to slice his shot wide of the target after side-stepping Bailey.  With less than ten minutes remaining, White headed in from a Terry Medwin pass.  Roy Stephenson scored a late consolation goal for Ipswich but Medwin completed Tottenham's scoring, with a shot following a pass from Greaves to end the match 5\u20131.", "|MF ||7 || Roy Stephenson"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Roy Stephenson"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["Nottingham Forest were the next visitors to Portman Road on 4 November, and despite them having considerably more chances to score, a solitary effort from Phillips midway through the first half was sufficient for Ipswich to take both points.  The following week saw Ipswich travel to Molineux where they faced Wolverhampton Wanderers.  The visitors were down to ten men after just six minutes as Roy Stephenson was forced to withdraw following a thigh injury.  Two late goals from Wolves, from Terry Wharton and Alan Hinton, resulted in a 2\u20130 defeat for Ipswich.  Matt Busby's Manchester United were Ipswich's opponents at Portman Road on 18 November, with the home side winning 4\u20131 with goals from Phillips (2), Crawford and Elsworthy, and United's late consolation goal coming from Sammy McMillan.  Both Busby and Ramsey acclaimed Phillips, the former suggesting that he had the \"hardest and most accurate shot in the game at present\" while the latter agreed: \"Ted is the best shot of my time.\"  The final game of November saw Ipswich visit Ninian Park where they faced Cardiff City.  With a performance described in the East Anglian Daily Times as \"deadly\", \"efficient\" and \"polished and planned\", the home team won 3\u20130 with goals from Moran and Phillips (2).  They finished the month in second place in the league, three points behind Burnley who had a game in hand, and a point ahead of West Ham United and Everton.
