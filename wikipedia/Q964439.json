He died on 10 August 1975 at the age of 94.", "On 15 December, Robert Barton was questioned by Kevin O'Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George's statement about signing the agreement or facing a renewal of war: \"Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say, 'The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war? Barton replied: \"What he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of every member of the delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty\". This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and \"terrible and immediate war\" became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed.Barton's statement, 15 Dec 1921  The next day, de Valera took up this point: \"therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. I believe that that document was signed under duress and, though I have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation.\"Secret debates, 16 Dec 1921; De Valera", "The split over the treaty led to the Irish Civil War (1922\u201323). In 1922, its two main Irish signatories, Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, both died. Birkenhead reportedly said on signing the treaty: \"Mr Collins, in signing this Treaty I'm signing my political death warrant\", to which Collins is said to have replied, \"Lord Birkenhead, I'm signing my actual death warrant.\" Collins was killed by anti-treaty republicans in an ambush at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th in August 1922, ten days after Griffith's death from heart failure which was ascribed to exhaustion. Both men were replaced in their posts by W. T. Cosgrave. Two of the other members of the delegation, Robert Barton and Erskine Childers, sided against the treaty in the civil war. Childers, head of anti-treaty propaganda in the conflict, was executed by the free state for possession of a pistol in November 1922."]}, {"page": "Second D\u00e1il", "response": ["On 14 September 1921, the D\u00e1il ratified the appointment of Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy as envoys plenipotentiary for the peace conference in England.

Between the Truce and the signing of the Treaty the Second D\u00e1il only sat on 10 days, and did not discuss in detail the options available to it. The debate on the Treaty started on 14 December, and continued for thirteen days of debate until 7 January 1922. On that date, the D\u00e1il approved the treaty by 64 in favour to 57 against. The Treaty Debates were the first publicly reported debate on what Sinn F\u00e9in felt that it had achieved and could achieve. In the vote, the deputies who represented more than one constituency were each only permitted to vote once, but this would not have changed the outcome. As the leader of the anti-Treaty minority de Valera resigned as President, and on 9 January his opponent Arthur Griffith was elected as president on a vote of 60\u201358.
