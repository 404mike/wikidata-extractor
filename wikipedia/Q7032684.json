He spent the early part of the race travelling well and at the seventh fence went into second place. He looked to put in an equally big jump at the eighth fence before seeming to change his mind just after take off and crashed through the fence. This knocked him back to fifth place and despite getting back into contention, he never recovered the fluidity of earlier in the race. At the fourth-to-last fence, known as the downhill fence, and when in fifth place, Kauto Star fell awkwardly, landing on his neck. However, he got to his feet, apparently unscathed. The race was won by the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Imperial Commander, with Denman in second and Mon Mome in third place.

Elliott took out a licence as an amateur jockey when he was sixteen and rode on the racecourse and in point-to-points. His first winner on the racecourse came on Caitriona's Choice in a bumper at Ballinrobe. He went on to ride a total of 200 point-to-point winners and 46 winners on the racecourse, with the highlight of his riding career being his win in the Punchestown Champion Bumper on the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained King's Road in 1998.
