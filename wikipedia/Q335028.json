See John Jellicoe (disambiguation) for pages about others with the same or similar name.Admiral of the Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe,  (5 December 1859 \u2013 20 November 1935) was a Royal Navy officer. He fought in the Anglo-Egyptian War and the Boxer Rebellion and commanded the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 during the First World War. His handling of the fleet at that battle was controversial. Jellicoe made no serious mistakes and the German High Seas Fleet retreated to port, at a time when defeat would have been catastrophic for Britain, but the public was disappointed that the Royal Navy had not won a more dramatic victory given that they outnumbered the enemy. Jellicoe later served as First Sea Lord, overseeing the expansion of the Naval Staff at the Admiralty and the introduction of convoys, but was relieved at the end of 1917. He also served as the Governor-General of New Zealand in the early 1920s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 5", "response": ["*1859 \u2013 John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, English admiral and politician, 2nd Governor-General of New Zealand (d. 1935)"]}, {"page": "1859", "response": ["* December 5 \u2013 John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, British admiral (d. 1935)"]}, {"page": "1935", "response": ["* November 20 \u2013 John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, British admiral (b. 1859)"]}]}}
