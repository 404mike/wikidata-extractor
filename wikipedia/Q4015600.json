Prior to joining the Slits, Albertine was a member of the Flowers of Romance.\nFollowing the Slits' break-up in 1982, Albertine studied filmmaking and subsequently worked as a freelance director for the BBC and British Film Institute. After a lengthy break from performing and recording music, Albertine released her sole solo studio album, The Vermilion Border, in 2012.\nAlbertine's first autobiography, Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys, was released in 2014 to widespread critical acclaim.

She was groundbreakingly different.\" Siouxsie and the Banshees frontwoman Siouxsie Sioux, naming \"Land\" as a recording she considered particularly influential on her, remarked that \"apart from Nico, Patti was the first real female writer in rock.\" R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe bought a copy of Horses as a high school student and said that the album \"tore [his] limbs off and put them back on in a whole different order\", citing Smith as his primary inspiration for becoming a musician. Morrissey and Johnny Marr shared an appreciation for the record, and one of their early compositions for the Smiths, \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", uses a melody based on that of \"Kimberly\". Courtney Love of Hole recounted that listening to Horses as a teenager helped encourage her to pursue a career in rock music, while PJ Harvey commented in 1992: \"I heard Horses once and it was brilliant\u2014not so much her music as her delivery, her words, her articulation.

Martin Atkins, who had initially joined at the tail end of the Metal Box sessions, was re-recruited to drum on The Flowers of Romance. Levene had by then largely abandoned guitar in favour of synthesiser, picking up a new technique although owing a debt to Allen Ravenstine of Pere Ubu. Atkins' propulsive marching band-style drumming, the lack of bass and guitar, and Lydon's increasing lyrical abstraction made this LP a difficult listen for rock fans, and contemporary reviews expressed great confusion. The record consists mostly of drums, vocals, musique concr\u00e8te, and tape loops, with only gestures toward bass (played by Levene) and keyboards. The title \"Flowers of Romance\" was the name of a short-lived band featuring Keith Levene, Viv Albertine, and Sid Vicious in 1976.

Westwood also inspired the style of punk icons, such as Viv Albertine, who wrote in her memoir, \"Vivienne and Malcolm use clothes to shock, irritate and provoke a reaction but also to inspire change. Mohair jumpers, knitted on big needles, so loosely that you can see all the way through them, T-shirts slashed and written on by hand, seams and labels on the outside, showing the construction of the piece; these attitudes are reflected in the music we make.

According to members of the Damned, Vicious was considered, along with Dave Vanian, for the position of lead singer for the Damned, but Vicious failed to show up for the audition.", "Vicious later contended that Vanian and associates had intentionally withheld information regarding the audition as an act of jealousy to ensure Vicious did not arrive. Soured by the experience, Vicious held a personal grudge for this perceived slight perpetrated against him by Vanian and The Damned, a grudge that would become violent. During The Damned's performance at day 2 of the 100 Club Punk Special, the day after making his debut drumming with Siouxsie and the Banshees, an intoxicated and amphetamine-fuelled Vicious hurled his glass at the stage. He was attempting to strike Dave Vanian as an act of retribution, but the glass missed, shattered on a pillar and partially blinded a girl in one eye.
