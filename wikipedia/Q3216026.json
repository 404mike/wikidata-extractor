American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States\u2014which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism\u2014became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government."]}, {"page": "Lord Alfred Paget", "response": ["* Almeric Hugh Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough (1861\u20131949), who married Pauline Payne Whitney in 1895.

The purpose of this group was to identify (and clarify the interconnections between) the most important secret societies existing at that time in Europe, the United States, and in the Middle East. They detailed their findings in Occult Theocrasy (2 vols.) (Chatou, France: British American Press, 1931-1933), a work whose publication was completed shortly after Edith's death. This work is now widely regarded as a \"conspiracy classic.\" Occult Theocrasy summarizes what was known at that time about the organizations and secret societies which collectively form what is now referred to, variously, as the Cabal, the Illuminati, the One World Government, the Secret World Government, or the New World Order. Although Occult Theocrasy is not an authoritative work in the strict sense - some sections of it are vastly more informative and candid than others - nevertheless, as a whole, the work was more comprehensive, up-to-date, and revealing in its subject-matter than any other similar work available in the English language at that time. The work contains overt antisemitic elements and attributes much of world history to a conspiracy of Jews. It gives credence to the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and has two chapters that express praise for the mission of the Ku Klux Klan. To its credit, most of the source information for Occult Theocrasy is listed in the book's bibliography. The work also features a brief occult glossary, and a detailed index."]}, {"page": "Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough", "response": ["On 19 July 1921, in New York City, he married conspiracy theorist and anti-Mormon agitator Edith Starr Miller, daughter of a wealthy American couple, William Starr Miller and Edith Caroline (Warren) Miller.
