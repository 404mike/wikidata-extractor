He was the bassist and backing vocalist in The Cooper Temple Clause (while also occasionally playing other instruments), and in Carl Bar\u00e2t's Dirty Pretty Things. The band's second album, Romance At Short Notice, saw Hammond taking on more vocal duties within the band, for example contributing all the vocals on the ballad \"The North\".  He is also the bass player in Brett Anderson's live electric band. Before music, Didz made his trade as a stand up comedian in Reading.In 2002, Hammond was named \"34th coolest person in the world\" by NME. He usually plays a yellow and black Fender Precision Bass and a red Burns Bison bass, but also has two semi-acoustic Epiphone basses, one in yellow and black sunburst, and a pink banjo, the other in red and black. He is also fond of acoustic basses, of which he has two - one with a natural finish, the other with a black gloss. Both are Epiphones.Hammond currently live in North London with his wife, Gemma, and son Jack (born 2015).

From 2002 to 2015, he presented Gonzo, its flagship music show. The show evolved from a two-hour random collection of presenting and clips, to a primetime (7pm) show featuring regular musical guests and interviews. The show was presented solely by Lowe, with the studio effectively being a blue screen and 'Brown Couch'. His presenting manner on Gonzo was more laid back than on his radio show. The show featured music videos, music news and input from the channel's message boards. The show also featured mock interview done by a character called Ginger Bloke, in which popular musical artists were humorously \"interviewed.\" Occasionally, moderators of the boards (chosen on Gonzo and by the members) contributed; one member even filled in for a week when Lowe was too unwell to present. At Oxegen Festival 2006, Zane Lowe was reportedly \"beaten up\" by Didz Hammond and Carl Bar\u00e2t from Dirty Pretty Things on an episode of Gonzo. He has since said that the punch was in fact completely playful but unfortunately, and painfully, connected with his groin.Zane Lowe on Dirty Pretty Things Bust-up. YouTube (11 November 2006).
