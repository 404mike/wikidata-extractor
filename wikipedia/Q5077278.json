In 1849 he was invited by William Sterndale Bennett to become a founder member of the Bach Society. In 1860 he was appointed to arrange the music for the 1862 International Exhibition. In the following year he emigrated to Australia, where he worked as a choral and orchestral conductor. He was appointed as the organist at Christ Church, South Yarra, but resigned after six months, frustrated by Bishop Perry's injunctions against music, Perry being an extreme Evangelical. In 1872 went to America. Three weeks after landing in America, he was appointed organist of St John's Chapel, New York at a salary of \u00a3500 a year, which position he filled to the day of his death. His wife, Georgina, to carry out his wishes, placed him to rest near and with his own people in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.\nHis works include a string quartet in C major, the manuscript of which is dated March 1861, shortly after his arrival in Australia; this is probably the first work for this combination to have been written on Australian soil. In  1870 Horsley was commissioned to compose a cantata Euterpe to a poem by Henry Kendall,  performed at the Melbourne Town Hall opening in 1876.In the United States he wrote sentimental and patriotic songs, which continued to appear until the last year of his life.\nThe world premi\u00e8re of his Mendelssohnian violin concerto op. 29 (1849) was performed on October 11, 2016 in Fayetteville, Arkansas by violinist Selim Giray and University of Arkansas Symphony Orchestra under the direction of conductor Robert K.

Some Australian folksongs date to this period. Among the first true works of Australian literature produced over this period was the accounts of the settlement of Sydney by Watkin Tench, a captain of the marines on the First Fleet to arrive in 1788. In 1819, poet, explorer, journalist and politician William Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States, in which he advocated an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts.
