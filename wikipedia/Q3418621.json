Dawson, who lived in the building's east wing, decided to fix up the campus, and hired J.W. Hopkins to add the portico with Doric columns that the Royal Institution had previously intended to build in front of the central block, though made out of wood. Dawson convinced Sir William Molson to donate to construct the McGill College Building's west wing, which would be called Molson Hall. The west wing was built in 1861 by William Spier, and held the convocation hall, classrooms, chemistry labs, a museum and a library. In 1888, Alexander Francis Dunlop made major alterations to the building's east wing for the Science Department. At some point within the next few decades, as McGill continued to grow, the McGill College Building was renamed the Arts Building.

This involved Capper hugely extending the previously very small Georgian terrace at Ramsay Gardens to create a hugely picturesque building now an iconic part of Edinburgh\u2019s townscape. This (although now hard to believe) was done as low-cost student housing but incorporated a house for Geddes himself within it. Sadly Capper\u2019s ill-health returned during the project and over-seeing of the completion and final detailing was done by Sydney Mitchell who is often incorrectly given credit for the full project. Together with the Ramsay Gardens project Capper also remodelled Riddle\u2019s Court, James Court and several Lawnmarket blocks as part of the same University Settlement concept. During this period Capper employed Ramsay Traquair as his assistant.", "In 1903 he returned to Britain, taking a chair as Professor of Architecture in Victoria University of Manchester.

The second director of the School, Percy Nobbs, arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students. Nobbs is credited with designing the McGill coat of arms three years into his tenure. As director, he divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague Cecil Burgess. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and designed the McGill Union (today the McCord Museum) across from McGill's Roddick Gates. After the Macdonald Engineering Building burned down in 1907, Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor. By 1912, the School had grown to eight students, and the next year, Philip J. Turner joined the faculty. In 1913, Ramsay Traquair became the new director.

He soon began to also teach Materials of Construction, Professional Practice and Specifications, and was appointed Professor in 1933. In addition to teaching at the School of Architecture, Turner was appointed Special Lecturer on Library Buildings in 1926 in the McGill Library School, which he continued to hold until after his retirement from the architecture school. In 1939, he succeeded Ramsay Traquair as the director of the School of Architecture, a position he held for only two years until 1941. During these two years, however, he accomplished a great deal at the School. Turner became director at a time when student enrollment was very low, in the wake of the Great Depression in Canada and the outbreak of World War II. Enrollment was so low that the Principal of McGill at the time, Lewis Williams Douglas considered phasing out architectural education at McGill. As director, Turner, along with his Executive Secretary, John Bland, fought the threat of the School's closing and gathered the support of several distinguished architects in Montreal, ultimately convincing the Principal not to close the School. He created an advisory committee on the School of Architecture in 1939, with E.I. Barott, Harold Lea Fetherstonhaugh and J.C. McDougal representing the profession, and he and Percy Nobbs representing the School."]}]}}
