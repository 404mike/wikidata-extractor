His only club at senior level was Kilmarnock where he spent 12 years, though he played in only 10 matches in his first four years at Rugby Park and was not involved in the run when they won the Scottish Cup in 1929; however he was a regular by the time they reached its final again in 1932, this time losing out to Rangers after a replay. He missed almost the entire 1933\u201334 season due to injury, but signed a new contract after recovering. Leslie left Kilmarnock in 1938 and was briefly on the books at Queen of the South at the end of that year, but did not play any official matches for them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Galston, East Ayrshire", "response": ["* James Leslie (1908\u20131980), footballer with Kilmarnock"]}, {"page": "James Leslie", "response": ["* James Leslie (bishop) (died 1695), Anglican bishop in Ireland", "* James Leslie (Canadian politician) (1786\u20131873), Canadian businessman and politician", "* James Leslie (engineer) (1801\u20131889), Scottish civil engineer", "* James Leslie (footballer) (1908\u20131980), Scottish footballer with Kilmarnock", "* James Leslie (British politician) (1958\u20132009), former MLA for North Antrim"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RB ||||James Leslie"]}, {"page": "Jim Leslie (footballer)", "response": ["James Leslie was a Scottish footballer who played for clubs including Clyde and Sunderland, as a forward."]}]}}
