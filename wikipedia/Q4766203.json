It also offered limited retrospective compensation via a Financial Assistance Scheme, but only for those within three years of retirement and only for a small fraction of their pension while the majority of those affected would get nothing. This attempt to stave off political opposition did not address the injustices so Altmann helped the victims put together appeals via their MPs to the Parliamentary Ombudsman, Ann Abraham, who selected four representative complaints and launched a detailed investigation into the role of Government in these pension losses. The Ombudsman's report was published in March 2006, and found official information \"inaccurate, incomplete, unclear and inconsistent\". The ombudsman recommended the government consider offering compensation for lost pensions and the suffering and distress caused. The report was immediately rejected by the Labour Government."]}, {"page": "Abraham (surname)", "response": ["*Ann Abraham (born 1952), British ombudsman"]}, {"page": "Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust", "response": ["The director of nursing, Paul Lumsden, resigned in March 2014 after less than three months in the post.
