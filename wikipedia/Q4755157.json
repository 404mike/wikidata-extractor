Toshiko finds the courage to ask Owen on a date, and he does eventually accept. Shortly afterwards however, on a mission assisted by Dr Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) of UNIT, Owen is shot dead by Dr Aaron Copley (Alan Dale). Not willing to let Owen die, Jack tracks down and uses the mysterious resurrection gauntlet to restore Owen to life: however, this glove works differently from the one from previous episodes, and Owen is left in a permanent state of living death. Owen is left to despair at his inability to eat, to drink, to enjoy sex and feel the beat of his own heart or heal from wounds, with the final point becoming a logistical concern after he breaks a finger on one of his hands, rendering that hand permanently limited as the bones will never mend. Despite being dead, he is forced to exercise regularly to avoid the onset of rigor mortis. His despair at his undead state causes Owen to become severely depressed and even attempt suicide, via drowning, only to find that he has no breath so it doesn't work. Mysteriously, Weevils also begin to follow Owen as if in worship. Owen is discharged again from Torchwood, but returns to his position after proving his sustained value as a field agent, with certain stealth advantages due to not feeling pain or having a heat signature. In subsequent episodes, two alien species ignore Owen's presence as being dead makes him of no use to them. The flashback-centric episode \"Fragments\" sheds light on how Owen came to join Torchwood: Owen's fianc\u00e9e Katie (Andrea Lowe) developed a parasitic alien tumor, which brought him to encounter Jack when she died; Jack notes Owen's determination and medical brilliance, and so hires him.  In addition to the standard BMBS degree of British physicians, Owen holds a dissertation-based MD.He tells Henry Parker in "]}, {"page": "Missing in Action 2: The Beginning", "response": ["* Andrea Lowe as Hooker #3"]}, {"page": "The Innocence Project", "response": ["* Andrea Lowe \u2014 Philippa Lucas"]}, {"page": "Lowe (surname)", "response": ["* Andrea Lowe (born 1975), English actress"]}, {"page": "List of people from Nottingham", "response": ["*(Born 1975) Andrea Lowe, actress best known for roles in Coronation Street, The Tudors and Ken Loach film Route Irish, was born in Arnold."]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Naomi Collins || Andrea Lowe || 2009"]}, {"page": "List of Estonian films since 1991", "response": ["| ||The Arbiter|| Kadri K\u00f5usaar || Lee Ingleby, Lina Leandersson, Andrea Lowe, Sofia Berg-B\u00f6hm || Drama || In English "]}, {"page": "Anna Carlsson", "response": ["| Accused || Donna Armstrong || Andrea LoweEp. \"Kennys Geschichte\" || "]}, {"page": "The Unloved", "response": ["* Andrea Lowe \u2013 Vicky"]}, {"page": "Route Irish (film)", "response": ["* Andrea Lowe as Rachel"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2010", "response": ["|Route Irish || Ken Loach || Mark Womack, Andrea Lowe || Drama || 20 May || Premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival"]}, {"page": "DCI Banks", "response": ["ITV commissioned a second series.

Stephen is taller than the Banks in the books, and my Annie is a brunette, whereas Andrea Lowe plays her as a blonde. It doesn't matter. You can't expect exact duplication.
