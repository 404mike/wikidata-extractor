He was educated in England at Winchester College and then went to Brasenose College, Oxford. He played cricket for Oxford University holding a stand in the drawn University match in 1938. He also played for Hampshire during the 1938 season. During the Second World War he served in the Rifle Brigade.After the war, Eggar became a master at Repton School and played for Derbyshire. Eggar with Guy Willatt, and Dick Sale formed a trio of Repton masters who played for the county. In the 1947 season he shared a record-breaking partnership of 349 with Charlie Elliott in the year when Derbyshire finished 5th. In the 1949 season he scored 218 in a match against Yorkshire. Eggar played regularly until the 1950 season when Derbyshire were fifth. He had a break until the 1954 season when he played two games and Derbyshire finished in third place in the County Championship. He held a testimonial match at Repton that summer. Two years later he played in a 2nd XI match for Derbyshire.  He was a right-handed batsman and played 64 innings in 41 first-class matches. His top score was 219 and his average 31.84. He was a right-arm medium-pace bowler but took only one wicket.In 1963 Eggar became headmaster of newly established Shiplake College. Under his headmastership, numbers went from 100 to 300. He retired in 1979 and died on a tennis court at Hinton St George, Somerset four years later.Eggar's father-in-law was John Crommelin-Brown, another Repton master who played cricket for Derbyshire during the 1920s. His son Tim Eggar became a Member of Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shiplake College", "response": ["Shiplake College was founded in 1959 by Alexander and Eunice Everett.  The land on which the school now stands was bought by Robert Harrison in 1888 and the original buildings date from 1890. The main building, which houses Skipwith House and the Great Hall, was built as a private residence for the Harrison family. The house was sold in 1925 and was at first a private home to Edward Goulding, 1st Baron Wargrave and then a prep school, before being sold to the BBC in 1941. Initially the BBC used Shiplake Court as a storage facility until in 1943 the BBC Monitoring Service moved to Caversham and the house became a hostel for BBC staff. The BBC closed the hostel in 1953 and the house remained largely unused until the arrival of the Everetts in 1958. The College now stands in 45 acres of land on the banks of the Thames. In late 1958 the Everetts purchased Shiplake Court with the intention of founding a school, which duly opened as Shiplake Court on 1 May 1959. In 1963 John Eggar, a Derbyshire cricketer who had been a housemaster at Repton School, became headmaster and in 1964 renamed the school Shiplake College. By the time he retired in 1979, numbers had increased to 300.The Times Obituary John Eggar Saturday 7 May 1983", "* John Eggar (1963\u20131979)"]}, {"page": "Tim Eggar", "response": ["Timothy Eggar is the son of John Eggar and Pamela Crommelin-Brown.

In total he played 468 innings in 275 matches with nine centuries and an average of 27.25. His best score was 215 against Nottinghamshire in 1947, when he shared a stand of 349 with John Eggar.

They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "Guy Willatt", "response": ["In 1950 Willatt returned from Scotland to teach at Repton and, like John Eggar and Dick Sale, combined cricket for Derbyshire with his teaching career. He was also released from teaching in the summer term so he could captain the county. He was designated captain in the 1950 season but was hampered by injury and Pat Vaulkhard substituted for him in the role while on the field Willatt was an unpredictable, middle-order batsman during his first season. He took over as captain in the 1951 season and occupied the post for the next three years, in which he played consistently for the team. He scored a century against his former team Nottinghamshire in 1951 and Derbyshire finished eleventh in the County Championship. In 1952, which was his personal best season, Willatt scored 1,624 runs, at an average of 35.3 including two centuries and the club were fourth in the Championship. In the 1953 season Willatt's batting average dropped, and Derbyshire slipped to sixth.  Willatt scored centuries against Kent and Sussex in the 1954 season and the club finished third in the county table."]}, {"page": "John Crommelin-Brown", "response": ["Crommelin-Brown's son-in-law John Eggar, another Repton master, played cricket for Derbyshire after the Second World War.The Times Obituary John Eggar Saturday 7 May 1983"]}, {"page": "Dick Sale", "response": ["Sale then became a master at Repton School, and made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1949 season.
