The revival was part of a wider national movement in the period around the First World War, and contributed to the creation of the English Pastoral School of classical music which incorporated traditional songs or motifs, as can be seen in the compositions of Percy Grainger (1882\u20131961), Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872\u20131951), George Butterworth (1885\u20131916), Gustav Holst (1874\u20131934) and Frederick Delius (1862\u20131934).M.
