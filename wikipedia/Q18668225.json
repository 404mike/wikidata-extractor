How to Dress Well cites its \"schizophrenic diversity\" as the inspiration for the album Total Loss, saying, \"She set such an example for trusting yourself, and following that intuition wherever it takes you... she made a fucking sprawling masterpiece with a song from every genre, and it works.\" Merchandise sold at Well's shows feature a quote from interlude \"Memory\". Indie rock band Wheat used the album as a reference for their second album Hope and Adams, also emulating its production techniques within lead single \"Don't I Hold You\". Folk rock singer Melissa Ferrick called it \"a huge record\" which inspired her song \"Drive\", saying, \"Janet Jackson was making these sexual noises on that record and I cannot even describe. [...] I was like \"This is unbelievable. Janet Jackson is so ballsy to do this. This is amazing.\" Cassie Ramone of Vivian Girls and folk singer Seth Glier regarded the album as an important life memoir. Swedish singer Beatrice Eli stated it \"defined her teenage years\". Art Nouvea considered Fiona Apple's When the Pawn... to be influenced by the record. FKA Twigs' single \"Water Me\" and Laura Welsh's \"Unravel\" were likened to the album, considered to evoke Jackson's \"mellower work\" at her \"most delicate\". Kingdom's \"Bank Head\", featuring Kelela, was thought to be influenced by \"Empty\", while Kelela and Tink's \"Want It\" was likened to the album's \"most tuneful deep cuts\". British singer Jai Paul's \"Str8 Outta Mumbai\" was regarded to fuse \"vintage Bollywood pop\" with \"Velvet Rope-era Janet\"."]}, {"page": "Amanda Ghost", "response": ["| rowspan=\"7\"|Laura Welsh", "| Laura Welsh", "| Laura Welsh, Babydaddy", "| Laura Welsh, Emile Haynie, Dev Hynes", "| Laura Welsh, Liam Howe", "| Laura Welsh, Emile Haynie, Babydaddy", "| Laura Welsh, Robin Hannibal", "| Laura Welsh, Robin Hannibal", "| Laura Welsh, Ian Dench"]}, {"page": "Babydaddy", "response": ["|Laura Welsh"]}, {"page": "Andrew Hollander", "response": ["Hollander has collaborated with a wide array of recording artists and songwriters including Carly Rae Jepsen, The Chainsmokers, New Politics, JoJo, Ali Tamposi, Brian Elmquist (The Lone Bellow), Rozes, Laura Welsh, Celine Dion, Ben Abraham, Jacquie Lee, White Rabbits, and C.
