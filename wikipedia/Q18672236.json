(22 January 1820 \u2013 28 January 1897) was a General in the Indian Army who served most of his military career in India including in the First Afghan War, the Second Afghan War, the Indian Mutiny and who was Resident at Baroda from 1873 to 1874 during which period the Maharaja Gaikwar, Malhar Rao, precipitated the Baroda Crisis and then attempted to poison Phayre, by putting arsenic and diamond dust in his sherbet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lewis Pelly", "response": ["On 21 June 1873, Pelly was appointed Agent to the Governor General of Rajputana, remaining in this post until 1878. This was the period of the Baroda Crisis. The embattled Robert Phayre, Resident in Baroda, was the apparent victim of an attempted poisoning in November 1874, on the orders of its ruler Malhar Rao Gaekwad; but was unwilling to resign. He was replaced by Pelly later that month. Pelly had Malhar Rao arrested in January 1875, and tried by a commission. The outcome was inconclusive, but Malhar Rao was deposed. Pelly was knighted (K.C.B.) in 1877."]}, {"page": "Curzon Wyllie", "response": ["Wyllie was promoted to captain in October 1878 and transferred to the foreign department in January 1879, serving as cantonment magistrate of Nasirabad, assistant commissioner in Ajmer-Merwara, and subsequently as the assistant to Sir Robert Groves Sandeman, the governor-general's agent in Baluchistan. He was part of Major-General Sir Robert Phayre's contingent in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when his actions earned him mentions in the Viceroy's dispatches. After the war, Wyllie was appointed the military secretary to the governor of Madras, William Patrick Adam (later also his brother-in-law) from December 1880 until Adam's death in the following May. On 29 December 1881, Wyllie married Katharine Georgiana Carmichael (15 July 1858 \u2014 9 September 1931), second daughter of David Fremantle Carmichael of the Indian Civil Service.

He had an increasingly negative relationship with Malhar Rao Gaekwad, the Gaekwar of Baroda. This antagonism culminated in the Baroda Enquiry which found 'serious misgovernment' in the state. However, instead of taking into account the findings of the report, Thomas Baring, the Viceroy of India, instead only gave the Gaekwar a warning. This allowed the increasingly hostile relationship between Phayre and Gaekwad to develop, with Phayre increasingly unwilling to work with Rao."]}, {"page": "Robert Phayre (British Army officer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Phayre (Indian Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Robert Phayre (1820\u20131897)", "response": ["#REDIRECTRobert Phayre (Indian Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Robert Phayre (1820-1897)", "response": ["#REDIRECT :Robert Phayre (Indian Army officer)"]}]}}
