The match was moved from Rovers' normal home ground of Stark's Park due to Easter Road's greater capacity. Easter Road has sometimes played host to Scottish League Cup semi-final matches, such as in the 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013 and 2014 competitions. Team managers Terry Butcher and Gus MacPherson objected to playing semi-finals at Easter Road, on the grounds that their players should have the chance to play at Hampden Park, or that playing against Hearts in Edinburgh gives them a form of home advantage. The 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final between Raith Rovers and Rangers was hosted at Easter Road."]}, {"page": "Scottish Premier League", "response": ["The only restriction on selection was the \"Under-21 rule\". This rule stated that each club must include at least three players under the age of 21 in its matchday squad. Opinions on this rule were divided among SPL managers.

He also had spells with Clydebank, Pollok, KR Reykjavik of Iceland and with Des Moines Menace in America before his return to St Mirren. He had been on trial at Love Street in the summer of 2003, and scored against Gretna before signing for two years on a part-time deal. When Gus MacPherson took over the managers job he appeared looking fitter and the magic moment finally came against Airdrie United in the Scottish Cup, when he hit a low 25-yard shot past the Airdrie goalkeeper for his only goal of the season so far. That goal took him past former Saint Mark Yardley in the post-war scorer's chart, but it was his last in Saints colours. His final game came against Ayr United towards the end of the season, and Lavety helped the side overcome a 0\u20131 deficit, which was turned into a 4\u20131 victory."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Scottish Premier League", "response": ["| Gus MacPherson"]}, {"page": "Mark Roberts (footballer, born 1975)", "response": ["Roberts joined Queen's Park in August 2018 as an assistant to Gus MacPherson.
