Commentators agree, however, that BWV 751 is too simple and undeveloped to be the work of Bach. Since the 1984 rediscovery of the Neumeister Collection, BWV 751 has been attributed to Johann Michael Bach. Bach also used the opening phrase of the melody as a fugal subject for two other choral preludes, BWV 703 (Gottes Sohn ist kommen) and BWV 724 (Gott durch deine G\u00fcte). BWV 729, written by Bach to accompany congregational singing in Arnstadt, is traditionally performed as the first organ voluntary at the end of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College, Cambridge.
