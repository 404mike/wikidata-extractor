While  still in high school, he studied with John Berryman at a summer writing conference at the University of Utah in 1959 and kept in touch with Berryman for the rest of the latter's life. Matthias attended the Ohio State University and Stanford University. While in graduate school at Stanford he studied under the poet and critic Yvor Winters but did not conform to Winters's anti-modernist position. In fact, Matthias became deeply interested in modernism, especially British modernism. His interest in British modernism was informed by many years of residence in England, editing the anthology 23 Modern British Poets, published in 1970. His peers at Stanford included two future poets laureate of the United States, Robert Hass and Robert Pinsky, as well as the poets Ken Fields, James L. McMichael, and John Peck. When he left Stanford in 1966, he spent a year in London as a Fulbright Scholar where he met Diana C. J. Adams (Feb. 5, 1945 - Nov. 26, 2020), and married her a year later. Diana's distinguished family includes several artists and writers, including her brother-in-law Wayland Young (Lord Kennet), the sculptor Emily Young, and the novelist Louisa Young. Many of Matthias's poems deal with this family. In 1976 Matthias became a Visiting Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, and has since 1977 been a Life Member. Although his main academic job has been at the University of Notre Dame, he has spent much of his professional life in Britain, where he did major scholarly work on the Anglo-Welsh poet and painter David Jones, editing both the poetry and essays on Jones's work for Faber and Faber, the National Poetry Foundation, and University of Wales Press."]}, {"page": "King Alfred School, London", "response": ["* Emily Young, sculptor"]}, {"page": "Friends' School, Saffron Walden", "response": ["* Emily Young, sculptor"]}, {"page": "Holland Park School", "response": ["* Emily Young, sculptor, daughter of author/politician Lord Kennet"]}, {"page": "Jeremy Clarke (poet)", "response": ["Clarke has collaborated with British sculptor Emily Young on a work in stone for St Pancras Old Church in London.

The commission was for Whistler to travel to Venice for three months to create a series of twelve etchings. Beguiled by the city, he stayed for fourteen months and completed approximately fifty etchings. Venice also inspired Whistler to make some hundred works in pastel, of which 53 were shown in the Venice Pastels exhibition in 1881. During Whistler's absence in Venice, the gallery showed his antagonist John Ruskin's private Collection of Watercolours by J. M. W. Turner, and ran a subscription to pay for Ruskin's legal costs: a supreme exhibition of political sleight of hand.
