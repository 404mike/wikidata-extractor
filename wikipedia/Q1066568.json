He sat as a Member of Parliament for Lincoln from 1826 to 1832 and from 1835 until 1855.\nSibthorp was born into a Lincoln gentry family, the son of Colonel Humphrey Waldo Sibthorp, of Canwick Hall, by his wife Susannah, daughter of Richard Ellison, of Sudbrooke Holme, Lincolnshire. His brother, Richard (1792-1879), was an Anglican clergyman (later admitted into the Roman Catholic faith). He was commissioned into the Scots Greys in 1803, promoted Lieutenant in 1806, and later transferred to the 4th Dragoon Guards, in which he reached the rank of Captain. He did not serve abroad and continued in the service until 1822, when he succeeded to the family estates and also succeeded his brother as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal South Lincolnshire Militia.  In 1812, he married Maria, daughter and co-heiress of Ponsonby Tottenham, M.P. for Fethard, County Tipperary; they had four children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Charles Sibthorp\t ", "|rowspan=\"5\"| Charles Sibthorp\t "]}, {"page": "Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp", "response": ["#Redirect Charles Sibthorp"]}, {"page": "Charles Delaet Waldo Sibthorp", "response": ["#redirectCharles Sibthorp"]}, {"page": "Sibthorpe (surname)", "response": ["* Charles Sibthorp (1783\u20131855), widely caricatured British Ultra-Tory politician in the early 19th century"]}, {"page": "Colonel Sibthorp", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Sibthorp"]}, {"page": "Gervaise Waldo-Sibthorp", "response": ["One of four children of Charles Sibthorp and Maria Ponsonby Tottenham, Waldo-Sibthorp married Louisa Amcotts and had two children: Montagu Richard and Coningsby Charles."]}, {"page": "Sibthorp, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Sibthorp"]}]}}
