It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Adrian Desmond suggests that \"[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function\". p. 273, note 20. That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man."]}, {"page": "1991 in literature", "response": ["*James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography: Adrian Desmond and James Moore, Darwin"]}, {"page": "Herbert Spencer", "response": ["Spencer's reputation among the Victorians owed a great deal to his agnosticism. He rejected theology as representing the 'impiety of the pious.' He was to gain much notoriety from his repudiation of traditional religion, and was frequently condemned by religious thinkers for allegedly advocating atheism and materialism. Nonetheless, unlike Thomas Henry Huxley, whose agnosticism was a militant creed directed at 'the unpardonable sin of faith' (in Adrian Desmond's phrase), Spencer insisted that he was not concerned to undermine religion in the name of science, but to bring about a reconciliation of the two. The following argument is a summary of Part 1 of his First Principles (2nd ed 1867)."]}, {"page": "William Benjamin Carpenter", "response": ["Carpenter was born on 29 October 1813 in Exeter, the eldest son of Dr Lant Carpenter and his wife, Anna Carpenter (n\u00e9e Penn). His father was an important Unitarian preacher who, according to Adrian Desmond, influenced a \"rising generation of Unitarian intellectuals, including James Martineau and the Westminster Review's John Bowring.\" From his father, Carpenter learned to believe in the essential lawfulness of creation and that explanations of the world were to be found in physical causes. He embraced this \"naturalistic cosmogony\" as his starting point."]}, {"page": "Ethnological Society of London", "response": ["*1868-9 Thomas HuxleyAdrian Desmond, Huxley: The Devil's Disciple (1994), p. 371."]}, {"page": "Historical race concepts", "response": ["Darwin's publication of this book occurred within the heated debates between advocates of monogeny, who held that all races came from a common ancestor, and advocates of polygeny, who held that the races were separately created. Darwin, who had come from a family with strong abolitionist ties, had experienced and was disturbed by cultures of slavery during his voyage on the Beagle years earlier. Noted Darwin biographers Adrian Desmond and James Moore argue that Darwin's writings on evolution were not only influenced by his abolitionist tendencies, but also his belief that non-white races were equal in regard to their intellectual capacity as white races, a belief which had been strongly disputed by scientists such as Morton, Agassiz and Broca, all noted polygenists."]}, {"page": "Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent", "response": ["Bory was a proponent of the theory of the transmutation of species alongside, among others, Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck.Herv\u00e9 Ferri\u00e8re, Bory de Saint-Vincent, militaire naturaliste entre R\u00e9volution et Restauration.
