His Internment Serial Number was 110. Ahmed was returned to the United Kingdom in March 2004, where he was released the next day without charges.He was one of three British men, friends from Tipton, United Kingdom, who had been detained. They became known as the Tipton Three. In August 2004, Ahmed, Shafiq Rasul and Asif Iqbal compiled and released a report on their abuses while in US custody.In Rasul v. Rumsfeld, the Tipton Three and Jamal Udeen Al-Harith, four former Guant\u00e1namo Bay internees, sued former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. They charge that illegal interrogation tactics were permitted to be used against them by Rumsfeld and the US military chain of command.\nThe 2006 film, The Road to Guant\u00e1namo, is a docu-drama by Michael Winterbottom depicting their account of their detention.\nAhmed was refused a visa by Australia to travel there to promote the film.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Al-Muhajiroun", "response": ["In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Al-Muhajiroun mostly focused on what they claimed was the injustice of the subsequent invasion of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and often held meetings where the flag of the Taliban; a white flag with the shahada in black; was displayed. According to a report Hope not Hate, a self-described anti-fascist group closely linked to the British Labour Party, Omar Bakri bragged of connections between Al-Muhajiroun and the so-called \"Tipton Three\" (Ruhal Ahmed, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul), who were arrested in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Richard Reid the so-called \"Shoe Bomber\" during the failed 2001 shoe bomb attempt was radicalised at the AM-linked Finsbury Park Mosque. Aftab Manzoor, Afzal Munir and Mohamed Omar who died in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and the Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had AM-connections. Indeed, Al-Muhajiroun maintained a safehouse in Lahore for visiting radicals fighting for the Taliban. The most explicit connection between AM and the 9/11 attacks itself was Zacarias Moussaoui who was radicalised by the group in Brixton during the 1990s; Moussaoui pled guilty to conspiring to carry out the attacks, but was in prison in Minnesota at the time that they were carried out (he was subsequently incarcerated at ADX Florence). On 11 September 2002, Abu Hamza along with Al-Muhajiroun held a conference which came to be known as the \"Magnificent 19\" meeting (a term referring to the hijackers). Promoted as the launching of the \"Islamic Council of Britain\" (a name chosen deliberately to cause public confusion with the mainstream Muslim Council of Britain), supposedly to advocate for sharia law, the conference at Finsbury Park Mosque was entitled \"September the 11th 2001: A Towering Day in History\" and posters, showing an image of planes crashing into the World Trade Center were put up in Stepney, Blackburn and Birmingham. Omar Bakri said that attendees \"look at September 11 like a battle, as a great achievement by the mujahideen against the evil superpower. I never praised September 11 after it happened but now I can see why they did it\" and described Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda as \"sincere [and] devoted people who stood firm against the invasion of a Muslim country.\" Anjem Choudary, Omar Bakri's deputy and a spokesman for Al-Muhajiroun also attended."]}, {"page": "Moazzam Begg", "response": ["Ruhal Ahmed was one of the so-called 'Tipton Three,' young men from Tipton in Britain who were held as Guantanamo detainees.
