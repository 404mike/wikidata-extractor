The son of a major in the 27th Dragoons, he received a commission in the same regiment (since retitled the 24th Light Dragoons) in 1804.  White served in India on the Sikh frontier; during the 1817 Siege of Hathras; the 1817-18 Third Anglo-Maratha War and the  1825-26 Siege of Bharatpur.  From 1839 he commanded the 3rd Light Dragoons and led them in the 1842 invasion of Afghanistan for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.\nWhite served as a brigade commander in the 1845-46 First Anglo-Sikh War.  At the Battle of Mudki he turned the Sikh flank and silenced their artillery.  On the first day of the Battle of Ferozeshah he led a cavalry charge that George Bruce described as having \"probably saved the day\" for the British.  The second day he led another charge that prevented Sikh cavalry from charging British infantry in a precarious condition.  Despite being wounded he continued to campaign and his gallant service at the Battle of Sobraon was rewarded by appointment as aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria.\nWhite also served in the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848-49.  He took command of the 14th Light Dragoons at the Battle of Ramnagar after the death of their commanding officer and led another cavalry charge. He also served at the battles of Chillianwala and Gujrat.  White was promoted to major-general in 1854 and to lieutenant-general in 1860.  He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1862.", "link_mentions": {}}}
