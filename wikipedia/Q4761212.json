Regular goalkeeper Andy Rankin was injured and Kindon took his place, only to be injured himself, his place in turn being taken by Mark Lillis. Each of them conceded a goal, and this remains an English record for the number of keepers used in one game. Injury then ended his career in 1982. Kindon was an England Youth, Under-23 and \"B\" international.

The start, however, was very unsensational, with 4 draws and a loss in their first 5 league games. Their form did improve, but the season was mainly noted for the amount of career-ending injuries to Steve Kindon, Andy Rankin, Dick Taylor, Fred Robinson and Peter Fletcher.
