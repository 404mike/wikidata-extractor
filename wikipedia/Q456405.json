Contrasted against the sometimes formulaic feel of Oakenfold's other comps, this is a stellar reminder of why he's remained a superstar for so long in a genre that's notorious for its short attention span.\"", "# Jan Johnston - \"Flesh\" (Dj Ti\u00ebsto Mix)"]}, {"page": "Perfecto Presents: Travelling", "response": ["# Jan Johnston - \"Flesh\" (Ti\u00ebsto Remix) (6:52)"]}, {"page": "Perfecto Presents Ibiza", "response": ["#Jan Johnston - \"Superstar\" (Bill Hamel Mix)", "#Jan Johnston - \"Silent Words\" (Solarstone Vocal Mix)"]}, {"page": "Perfecto Presents: The Club", "response": ["#Jan Johnston - \"Delirium\""]}, {"page": "JJ (band)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jan Johnston"]}, {"page": "Ti\u00ebsto discography", "response": ["| Jan Johnston", "| DJ Cor Fijneman featuring Jan Johnston"]}, {"page": "Revolution (Ti\u00ebsto album)", "response": ["# Jan Johnston - \"Flesh\" [DJ Ti\u00ebsto Mix] \u2013 6:23"]}, {"page": "List of Festival Mushroom Records artists", "response": ["* Jan Johnston (licensed from Perfecto)"]}, {"page": "Ti\u00ebsto in Concert", "response": ["Ti\u00ebsto in Concert is a DVD and Blu-ray of Ti\u00ebsto's concert on May 10, 2003, at the Gelredome in Arnhem, Gelderland, Netherlands, when he performed before an audience of over 25,000 people.
