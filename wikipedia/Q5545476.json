In 1824 he made an excursion to the Alps for the purpose of investigating the route of Hannibal, and the idea of publishing Illustrations of the Passes occurred to him. During the summers of 1825, 1826, 1828, and 1829, he was led in the course of his journeys to cross the Alps fifty-eight times, and to pass into and out of Italy by more than forty different routes. The result was the publication, in 1827, of the first part of his Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps by which Italy communicates with France, Switzerland, and Germany. The work, containing 109 engravings, was issued in twelve parts, from 1827 to 1829, forming when complete two royal quarto volumes, and was dedicated to his earliest patron, Archdeacon Froude. The drawings, which were entirely by Brockedon's own hand, were done in sepia, and were sold in 1837 to George Venables-Vernon, 5th Baron Vernon for 500 guineas."]}, {"page": "George John Warren Vernon, 5th Lord Vernon", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Venables-Vernon, 5th Baron Vernon"]}, {"page": "George John Venables-Vernon, 5th Baron Vernon", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Venables-Vernon, 5th Baron Vernon"]}, {"page": "Cuthbert Ellison (Newcastle MP)", "response": ["His daughter Sarah Caroline, married Walter James, 1st Baron Northbourne.
