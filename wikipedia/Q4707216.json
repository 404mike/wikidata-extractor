Captain Jeremy Bates surprised everyone by naming Murray as the British No 1 and Alan Mackin as British No 2. Under the Davis Cup rules, this meant that for Friday's singles, Murray played the Swiss No 2, Stan Wawrinka while Mackin played the Swiss No 1, Roger Federer. Bates opted for this line-up believed that Federer was virtually unbeatable because he was on a winning streak and hadn't lost since June, and consequently Britain gambled on beating Wawrinka twice, with Murray playing Wawrinka on Friday when he was freshest. Under the rules for the Sunday reverse singles, he would have been able to substitute Mackin with Greg Rusedski, so that Rusedski would play Wawrinka, while Murray played Federer. However Great Britain lost both of their Friday rubbers, giving Switzerland a 2\u20130 lead. In the doubles, Murray/Rusedski played Federer and Yves Allegro. The British tactics came to nought as Switzerland won the doubles rubber as well, gaining an unassailable 3\u20130 lead after two days. Alan Mackin and David Sherwood were consequently nominated for the dead singles rubbers losing both of them, resulting in a clean sweep for Switzerland."]}, {"page": "Junior Davis Cup and Junior Billie Jean King Cup", "response": ["|Simon DicksonMark HiltonAlan Mackin"]}, {"page": "2005 Roger Federer tennis season", "response": ["| Alan Mackin"]}, {"page": "Korn\u00e9l Bard\u00f3czky", "response": ["| Alan Mackin"]}, {"page": "Andrew Richardson (tennis)", "response": ["He is now a tennis coach and has worked with British players Ross Hutchins, Miles Kasiri, Alan Mackin and Emma Raducanu.
