He then spent six years with Guildford City of the Southern League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eric Gill", "response": ["Eric Gill was born in 1882 in Hamilton Road, Brighton, the second of the 13 children of the Reverend Arthur Tidman Gill and (Cicely) Rose King (d. 1929), formerly a professional singer of light opera under the name Rose le Roi. Arthur Tidman Gill had left the Congregational church in 1878 over doctrinal disagreements and became a minister of a sect of Calvinist Methodists known as the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. Arthur was born in the South Seas, where his father, George Gill, was a Congregational minister and missionary. Eric Gill was the elder brother of the graphic artist MacDonald \"Max\" Gill (1884\u20131947). Two of his other brothers, Romney and Cecil, became Anglican missionaries while their sister, Madeline, became a nun and also undertook missionary work.", "In 1897, the family moved to Chichester, when Arthur Tidman Gill left the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, became a mature student at Chichester Theological College and joined the Church of England. Eric Gill studied at Chichester Technical and Art School, where he won a Queen's Prize for perspective drawing and developed a passion for lettering. Later in his life, Gill cited the Norman and medieval carved stone panels in Chichester Cathedral as a major influence on his sculpture. In 1900 Gill became disillusioned with Chichester and moved to London to train as an architect with the practice of W. D. Car\u00f6e, specialists in ecclesiastical architecture with a large office close to Westminster Abbey.", "Late in 1909 Gill decided to become a sculptor. Gill had always considered himself an artisan craftsman rather than an artist. He rejected the (then) usual method in academic art of creating a model in clay and leaving it to an artisan to have it scaled up to a full-size sculpture, in favour of direct carving of the final figure. His first sculptures included Madonna and Child (1910), which the art critic Roger Fry described as a depiction of \"pathetic animalism\", and the almost life-size Ecstasy (1911). The models for Ecstasy were Ernest Laughton and Gladys Gill. Gladys and Eric Gill were in an incestuous relationship that continued throughout their adult lives. There is also some evidence, from Gill's own writings, of a incestuous relationship with another of his sisters.", "File:Lapworth Eric Gill bas relief 2015.jpg|Bas-relief in Lapworth parish church, 1928.", "File:Eric Gill seahorse-Midland Hotel Morecombe.JPG|Seahorse on the Midland Hotel, Morecambe", "File:GillFaces.png|Specimens of typefaces by Eric Gill", "Gill published numerous essays on the relationship between art and religion, and a number of erotic engravings.Christopher Skelton (ed.), Eric Gill, The Engravings, Herbert Press, 1990, .", "*A Holy Tradition of Working: passages from the writings of Eric Gill 1983.

He came into the team in 1922, and over the next 12 seasons averaged around 44 competitive matches a season, taking his total to 566 by the time he retired in 1936. Tommy Cook tops the club's all-time scorers list, with 123 goals from 209 peacetime matches. Kit Napier's 99 remained a post-Second World War record for nearly 50 years, until Glenn Murray scored his 100th Albion goal in October 2018. Arthur Attwood's club record of 35 goals scored in a single season stood for 45 years, until Peter Ward went one better in 1976\u201377 to set a mark that still stands. Eric Gill set the club record for consecutive appearances with 247 in the mid-1950s."]}]}}
