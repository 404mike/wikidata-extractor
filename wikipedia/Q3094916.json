He represented Cumberland County  in the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia from 1765 to 1770.\nHe was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts, the son of Captain Joseph Smethurst and Tabitha Skinner. In 1761, Smethurst travelled to Chaleur Bay to trade with the French and natives under a license from the military governor of Quebec, James Murray. Smethurst was abandoned by a captain in the employ of Roderick Mackenzie, and so was forced to make his way to Fort Cumberland in the month of November, without food or shelter. Smethurst returned to Marblehead by way of Halifax but, in 1763, received a land grant in Cumberland County. He served as customs comptroller and deputy surveyor of woods. Not long after his term in the Nova Scotia assembly, he moved to London, England.In 1774, he published A narrative of an extraordinary escape: out of the hands of the Indians, in the Gulph of St. Lawrence describing his earlier voyage to Chaleur Bay.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bathurst, New Brunswick", "response": ["According to Gamaliel Smethurst, a trader who supposedly was permitted there by Governor Murray, the British attempted to remove the remaining scattered Acadians from the Nepisiguit basin and Caraquet in late October 1761. Following the formal fall of this part of Acadia to British control in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, the region saw the arrival of numerous English and Scottish settlers, eager to exploit the region's natural resources. Some grants were rewards for good and loyal service with the King's arms: for example, Captain Arthur Goold of the Royal Marines was granted 2,000 acres on both sides of the Nepisiguit River mouth on 9 September 1784 in what is now known as East Bathurst.archives.gnb.ca: \"Index to New Brunswick Land Grants, 1784 - 1997 (RS686) - GOOLD, Arthur\""]}, {"page": "1826 in literature", "response": ["*July 20 \u2013 Gamaliel Smethurst, Nova Scotian memoirist (born 1738)"]}, {"page": "Captivity narrative", "response": ["During the war Gamaliel Smethurst was captured; he published an account in 1774.
