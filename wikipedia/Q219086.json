After an exploration of the upper Niger River around 1796, he wrote a popular and influential travel book titled Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa in which he theorized the Niger and Congo merged to become the same river. He was killed during a second expedition, having successfully traveled about two-thirds of the way down the Niger. With Park's death, the idea of a Niger-Congo merger remained an open question although it became the leading theory among geographers. The mystery of the Niger's course, which had been speculated about since the Ancient Greeks and was second only to the mystery of the Nile's source, was not solved for another 25 years, in 1830, when it was discovered the Niger and Congo were in fact separate rivers. \nIf the African Association was the \"beginning of the age of African exploration\" then Mungo Park was its first successful explorer; he set a standard for all who followed. Park was the first Westerner to have recorded travels in the central portion of the Niger, and through his popular book introduced the public to a vast unexplored continent which influenced future European explorers and colonial ambitions in Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Mungo Park (1771\u20131806), botanist and surgeon who conducted many journeys to Africa and was the first Westerner to encounter the central portion of the Niger River"]}, {"page": "History of Africa", "response": ["Knowledge of Africa increased.

The Niger Delta, pouring into the Atlantic through mangrove swamps and thousands of distributaries along more than , was thought to be coastal wetlands. It was only with the 18th-century visits of Mungo Park, who travelled down the Niger River and visited the great Sahelian empires of his day, that Europeans correctly identified the course of the Niger and extended the name to its entire course.", "Many European expeditions to plot the river were unsuccessful.Plumb, 1952. In 1788 the African Association was formed in England to promote the exploration of Africa in the hopes of locating the Niger, and in June 1796 the Scottish explorer Mungo Park was the first European to lay eyes on the middle portion of the river since antiquity (and perhaps ever). He wrote an account in 1799, Travels in the Interior of Africa. Park proposed a theory that the Niger and Congo were the same river. Although the Niger Delta would seem like an obvious candidate, it was a maze of streams and swamps that did not look like the head of a great river. He died in 1806 on a second expedition attempting to prove the Niger-Congo connection. The theory became the leading one in Europe. Several failed expeditions followed; however the mystery of the Niger would not be solved for another 25 years, in 1830, when Richard Lander and his brother became the first Europeans to follow the course of the Niger to the ocean."]}, {"page": "September 11", "response": ["*1771 \u2013 Mungo Park, Scottish surgeon and explorer (d. 1806)"]}, {"page": "1796", "response": ["* June 21 \u2013 British explorer Mungo Park becomes the first European to reach the Niger River.", "* July 21 \u2013 Mungo Park reaches S\u00e9gou, the capital of the Bamana Empire."]}, {"page": "1806", "response": ["* Mungo Park, Scottish explorer (b. 1771)"]}, {"page": "1771", "response": ["* September 11 \u2013 Mungo Park, Scottish explorer (d. 1806)"]}, {"page": "Atlantic slave trade", "response": ["The treatment of slaves in Africa was more variable than in the Americas.

Among these settlements, the most important probably was Pisania. This settlement, which was already in operation by 1779, was occupied by Dr John Laidley and a family by the name of Aynsley.
