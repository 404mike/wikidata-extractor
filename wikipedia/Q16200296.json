He is chiefly known as a footballer and was part of Derry's 1993 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship winning side, also won Ulster Senior Football Championships in 1993 and 1998. With Derry footballers he usually played at corner-back and is regarded as one of the best defenders and tightest markers to have played the game.In 2000 McKeever became the first Ulster player to be nominated for All Stars in both football and hurling in the same season. He won the football All Star, but narrowly missed out on the hurling accolade. Had he have won the double All Star, he would have become only the second player ever after Cork legend Ray Cummins to win both awards in the same year.He has won Irish News Ulster All-Star awards and was named right-corner back on the Irish News Team of the Decade in 2004. The public voted him onto the All-Time Derry Football Team via an online poll in 2007. McKeever played club football with St. Canice's GAC Dungiven and club hurling with Kevin Lynchs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dungiven", "response": ["*Kieran McKeever (b. 1968), member of Derry's 1993 All-Ireland winning team; won an All Star in 2000"]}, {"page": "Ciar\u00e1n", "response": ["* Kieran McKeever (born 1968), Irish dual player"]}, {"page": "Ulster Senior Hurling Championship", "response": ["*Derry 4\u20138 \u2013 0\u201319 Antrim (9 July 2000 at Casement Park) \u2013 An historic day for Derry who secured the Ulster title for the first time in 92 years.
