Recorded at Parkgate Studios in Battle, England, it is the third track on their third studio album, Regular Urban Survivors (1996). The band's frontman, Tony Wright, composed the music by stitching together several guitar riffs and penned the lyric based on his personal opinions and experiences, including a line about whales and dolphins that has resounded with audiences.", "In an interview with Songwriting magazine, Terrorvision frontman Tony Wright explained that \"Perseverance\" was born out of a series of instrumental riffs sewn together, unlike the band's usual process of composing the majority of a song and playing the results for one another. The song's lyric stems from the opening line: \"I was high on a Molotov of cocktails\"; when Wright presented this lyric to his bandmates, writing the rest of the song became easier. He also wanted to put the phrase \"whales and dolphins\" into the song because of his affinity toward the two animals, and he believes that line was what seized the listeners' attentions. Several other lines were reflective of Wright's life at the time. Eventually, the band went to Parkgate Studios in Battle, England, to record the song. Although it was still unfinished before the session commenced, the band and producer Gil Norton continued to build on the song, including adding the brass portions of the track.", "** Tony Wright \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "III Wishes (song)", "response": ["According to vocalist Tony Wright, distribution and stock issues hindered the song's success.
