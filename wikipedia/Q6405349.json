Just hours before the match, Stevenage announced the signing of Byron Harrison from Carshalton Athletic. Harrison started the match, playing 61 minutes before being substituted. Just two days later, Stevenage entertained Barnet at Broadhall Way. Former Stevenage manager Paul Fairclough took caretaker charge of the Barnet side for the game. The game ended 4\u20132 in Stevenage's favour. The hosts were 2\u20130 up after just eight minutes, thanks to a Luke Foster strike and a Grant Basey own goal. Stevenage's third came just before the half-hour mark, Chris Beardsley and Rob Sinclair exchanged passes, before Sinclair sent a looping cross into the box that was met on the volley by the arriving Stacy Long. Captain Mark Roberts added a fourth shortly after the interval, his second goal of the season \u2013 his first also coming against Barnet. Barnet added two consolation goals in the space of three second-half minutes through Izale McLeod and Mark Marshall. The win meant that Stevenage had secured their first three points since early November. Stevenage then fell to another away defeat, this time losing 1\u20130 at Chesterfield at the B2net Stadium, with Chesterfield scoring just before the interval. A week later, Stevenage secured their second consecutive home victory with a 2\u20130 win against Morecambe at Broadhall Way. Both of the goals came in the first ten minutes of the match \u2013 Scott Laird scored the first goal, turning John Mousinho's cross into the net after just five minutes. Four minutes later, Laird's cross was sliced into the net by Morecambe defender Kieran Charnock. Stevenage then followed this up with another home victory three days later, this time winning 3\u20130 against Rotherham United. Peter Winn opened the scoring just before the interval, cutting inside from the right wing and lashing a shot that beat Rotherham goalkeeper Andy Warrington at his near post. Substitute Byron Harrison scored his first goal for the club just three minutes after coming off the bench, scoring from close range after Rob Sinclair's right wing cross. Scott Laird then added a third in injury-time, collecting Lawrie Wilson's pass and curling the ball into the top right hand corner of the goal."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["After being informed by chairman Simon Baker that the club's playing budget had been cut, Paul Buckle now found his options limited as he attempted to revive Torquay's flagging league campaign.  In his efforts to \"shuffle the pack\", Buckle would now have to delve into the loan market and also make some tough decisions with the current squad members.  Most significantly, after first being dropped for September's match against Aldershot and then again for the trip to Crewe Alexandra, club captain Nicky Wroe was placed on the transfer list.  It was also made known that the club would be open to offers for defender Kieran Charnock who had struggled to break up the central defensive partnership forged by Mark Ellis and Guy Branston.", "No new additions were made to the squad during the month, although the loan deal for Joe Oastler was extended until January while Wolves agreed to allow Ashley Hemmings to extend his stay at Plainmoor.  With the loan window about to close, leading striker Elliot Benyon appeared to be on the verge of leaving Torquay, with Swindon, Dagenham & Redbridge and Southend among the clubs reported to have been interested in making a move for the young forward.  However, Gulls fans were relieved when the window closed with Benyon still part of the United squad - at least until the January transfer window.  Of the two players placed on the transfer list in October, Kieran Charnock moved on loan to Morecambe, with a view to making the deal a permanent one in January. However, former captain Nicky Wroe now seemed happy to remain at Plainmoor after Paul Buckle revealed the midfielder had rejected a move to Aldershot.", "Another year, another transfer window and another FA Cup run for Torquay United.  Despite being the favourite with many bookmakers to take over at Bristol Rovers, Paul Buckle was left to focus on his job at Plainmoor after Dave Penney was installed as the new manager at the Memorial Stadium.  As is often the case, most of the transfer activity was left until the last day of January, although two predictable changes did take place early in the month with Kieran Charnock making his loan move to Morecambe a permanent one and Martin Gritton returning to parent club Chesterfield after the striker had failed to make an impression during his second spell at the club.  Meanwhile, Joe Oastler had his loan from QPR extended until the end of the season.", "|6 ||  || DF || Kieran Charnock || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0", "|Kieran Charnock", "|Kieran Charnock"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Kieran Charnock", "| Kieran Charnock", "| Kieran Charnock"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["| Kieran Charnock", "| Kieran Charnock"]}, {"page": "Charnock (surname)", "response": ["*Kieran Charnock (born 1984), English football player"]}]}}
