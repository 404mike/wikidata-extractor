He also captained the England C team in 2012.\nA former captain of Manchester United Reserves, he joined Oxford United in 2007 following a four-month loan spell. He switched to Newport County the following year, and helped Newport to the Conference South title in 2009\u201310. He was sold to Fleetwood Town in January 2012, and was part of the side that won the Conference Premier title in 2011\u201312, before returning to Oxford in June 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dean Holdsworth", "response": ["He made a return to Newport County in May 2008 as their new manager in succession to Peter Beadle, after handing in his resignation at Redbridge. He also relocated to Worcester to accommodate his new role at Newport. After a poor start to the 2008\u201309 season, Newport improved in the second half of the season to finish tenth in the league. Holdsworth was awarded the Conference South Manager of the Month award for April 2009. His signings included Craig Reid, Danny Rose, Paul Bignot, Jamie Collins, Charlie Henry, Sam Foley and Gary Warren.", "Holdsworth signed a new one-year extension to his contract with the club in June 2012, tying him to the club until summer 2014. The next month he rejected the opportunity to take over as manager of League One club Crawley Town. Over the summer he signed goalkeeper Glenn Morris, defenders Olly Lancashire and Guy Branston, and midfielders Craig Stanley and Harry Cooksley. Holdsworth targeted the play-offs for the 2012\u201313 season, though said that \"our aim is, first and foremost, staying in the division.\" Over the course of the season he also added Sonny Bradley (on loan), Danny Rose (on loan), Kieron Cadogan, Oliver Risser, Asa Hall (on loan), and Anthony McNamee to his squad. He led Aldershot to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup for the first time in the club's history. On 20 February 2013 he was sacked by Aldershot, three days after his twin brother David Holdsworth was sacked as manager of Lincoln City, and one day after Aldershot recorded a 1\u20130 victory over Torquay United.

The season began in the best possible way at Kettering Town's new Nene Park ground with Elliot Buchanan putting County into a 1\u20130 lead after only six minutes. However hints of the season-to-come's struggles were evident when Kettering scored twice in the second half to lead 2\u20131. Danny Rose immediately equalised to leave the score 2\u20132 until Kettering were awarded a 90th-minute penalty. This was duly converted and County lost 3\u20132. The first home game against Hayes & Yeading was emphatically won 4\u20130, but thereafter began a run of 10 games without victory that cost Anthony Hudson his job. After draws against Grimsby Town and Ebbsfleet United County suffered five straight defeats including a televised 5\u20130 humiliation away at Mansfield Town that pushed County into the relegation zone. In each of the next three games County were on course for victory but succumbed to late goals. At home to Stockport County for the first time since August 1987 Danny Rose had given the home side a 30th-minute lead only for an 81st-minute equaliser for the visitors to deny Newport a win. In the next home game against Barrow County were 2\u20131 up going into injury time but again fell to a 90th-minute penalty, drawing 2\u20132. Away to Forest Green Rovers County were winning 1\u20130 only for former County player Charlie Griffin to equalise and yet another game was drawn. This was to prove to be Hudson's last game in charge. With a miserable return of only five points from their last ten games and County lying in last-but-one place in the table he was sacked the next day. Assistant manager Lee Harrison took charge for the next game away at Darlington who themselves were in a bad run of form, but County's miserable run continued. Two first half goals for the home side helped them to their first win in seven games with County remaining rooted in the relegation zone four points from safety. Justin Edinburgh was announced as the new manager on 4 October with the job of saving County from relegation. The enormity of the task was revealed in his first game in charge at home to Southport with three first-half goals condemning County to yet another defeat. The next game away to promotion hopefuls Fleetwood Town began with the home side taking the lead within 52 seconds. However a rout was avoided and against all the odds County eventually ran out 4\u20131 winners with Sam Foley scoring a hat-trick. This most unlikely of victories was only the second of 15 games so far in the season. After a 2\u20131 defeat at Tamworth revenge was extracted on Kettering Town in a 3\u20131 home victory with Danny Rose scoring a hat-trick. After a 0\u20130 draw at Wrexham and a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Ebbsfleet United County travelled to Blundell Park to face Grimsby Town. After being 2\u20130 up inside 17 minutes County again fell to late goals, with Serge Makofo scoring in the 79th minute and Anthony Elding converting an 87th-minute penalty. At home against Luton Town County looked on course to get a point from a 0\u20130 draw but yet again were undone by a late goal with Danny Crow scoring in the 2nd minute of stoppage time. In the next game at Woking's Kingfield Stadium County achieved a second 4\u20130 victory over Hayes & Yeading which finally lifted them out of the relegation zone on goal difference. This was followed the first visit of Lincoln City since the Third Division match of March 1986. This match was won 1\u20130 and County leapfrogged City into 18th place in the table. In the next game at home to 23rd-placed Alfreton Town County's record of conceding late goals continued. After leading from an Eliott Buchanan goal in the 4th minute County were 2\u20131 behind by the 28th minute. A Gary Warren equaliser in the 60th minute looked to have achieved a point for County, but an 89th-minute winner gave Alfreton just their second win in 14 games. With the proposed Boxing Day fixture at home to Bath City a victim of the weather the last game of 2011 was the home fixture against high-flying Fleetwood Town. Fleetwood maintained their charge at the top of the table with a 75th-minute winner but County saw out the end of the year outside the relegation zone.", "|7||MF||align=\"left\"| Danny Rose||25 (0)||11||5 (0)||0||30 (0)||11", "|1 Jan 2012||MF|| Danny Rose||Fleetwood Town||Undisclosed"]}, {"page": "2009\u20132011 International Challenge Trophy", "response": [" England C: Preston Edwards; Lee Vaughan, Connor Franklin (Matty Blair 65), Rob Atkinson, Max Porter, Michael Wilde (Josh Coulson 73), Andy Mangan, Danny Rose (Jack Byrne 81), George Donnelly, Josh Simpson (Reece Styche 71), Sean Clancy"]}, {"page": "Danny Rose (footballer born 1988)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Danny Rose (footballer, born 1988)"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|MF || ||7 ||Danny Rose || 2 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 3", "|7 || ||MF ||Danny Rose || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 0"]}]}}
