As a prolific author of romance novels, she had two other pseudonyms, Kathryn Blair and Celine Conway. At the height of her career, Warren was considered one of publisher's superstars, who set high sales records and a standard for romances published during the 1950s. Joseph McAleer in his book Passion's Fortune: The Story of Mills and Boon, describes Brett's work as so sexy for the era, that it often had to be \"watered down\". According to McAleer, she is credited by Anne Weale as inventing the \"punishing kiss\". Brett/Warren came to Mills & Boon from Rich & Cowan, a publisher she felt didn't offer her enough support."]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1960", "response": ["| # 537 || Castle In Corsica || Anne Weale || 1960", "| # 553 || The House Of Seven Fountains || Anne Weale || 1960"]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1962", "response": ["| # 644 || Never To Love || Anne Weale || 1962"]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1963", "response": ["| # 716 || The Doctor's Daughters || Anne Weale || 1963 ", "| # 743 || The House On Flamingo Cay || Anne Weale || 1963 ", "| # 767 || The Silver Dolphin || Anne Weale || 1963 "]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1964", "response": ["| # 798 || If This Is Love || Anne Weale || February 1964 ", "| # 830 || All I Ask || Anne Weale || June 1964 ", "| # 855 || Until We Met || Anne Weale || September 1964 ", "| # 879 || Sweet To Remember || Anne Weale || December 1964 "]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1965", "response": ["| # 901 || Hope For Tomorrow || Anne Weale || March 1965 ", "| # 914 || Doctor In Malaya || Anne Weale || May 1965 ", "| # 948 || Islands Of Summer || Anne Weale || September 1965 "]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1966", "response": ["| # 981 || Christina Comes To Town || Anne Weale || January 1966 ", "| # 1007 || The Feast Of Sara || Anne Weale || April 1966 ", "| # 1027 || The Lonely Shore || Anne Weale || July 1966 ", "| # 1067 || Terrace In The Sun || Anne Weale || December 1966 "]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1975", "response": ["| # 1848 || Lord Of The Sierras || Anne Weale || January 1975 "]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1982", "response": ["| # 2484 || Bed Of Roses || Anne Weale || June 1982 "]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1994", "response": ["| # 3318 || The Faberge Cat || Anne Weale || June 1994 "]}, {"page": "June 1929", "response": ["**Anne Weale, reporter and writer, in England (d. 2007)"]}, {"page": "Weale, Anne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Weale"]}, {"page": "All I Ask (disambiguation)", "response": ["* All I Ask, a 1964 romantic novel by Anne Weale"]}, {"page": "Never Go Back", "response": ["*Never Go Back, novel by Anne Weale Mills & Boon 1995"]}]}}
