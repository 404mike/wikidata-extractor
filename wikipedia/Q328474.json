Richard Feynman developed another functional integral, the path integral, useful for computing the quantum properties of systems.  In Feynman's path integral, the classical notion of a unique trajectory for a particle is replaced by an infinite sum of classical paths, each weighted differently according to its classical properties."]}, {"page": "List of Cambridge mathematicians", "response": ["*Percy John Daniell"]}, {"page": "Daniell", "response": ["* Percy John Daniell (1889\u20131946), British mathematician"]}, {"page": "Kolmogorov extension theorem", "response": ["In mathematics, the Kolmogorov extension theorem (also known as Kolmogorov existence theorem, the Kolmogorov consistency theorem or the Daniell-Kolmogorov theorem) is a theorem that guarantees that a suitably \"consistent\" collection of finite-dimensional distributions will define a stochastic process.
