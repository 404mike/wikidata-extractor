Six weeks before the 1995 season, Chase experienced financial difficulties and failed to post the required $100,000 letter of credit with the league by the March 1 deadline.  The league nearly revoked the franchise, but, South African businessman Johnny Imerman quickly stepped in and bought the team. The Ruckus, under former U.S. national team coach Lothar Osiander, began its competitive existence on May 5, 1995, when it defeated the Vancouver Whitecaps in the first game of the newly renamed A-League.  The Ruckus experienced a mid-season loss of form, but the addition of several new players, including Justin Fashanu, led to a resurgence.  Atlanta made it to the championship series, only to lose to the Seattle Sounders in three games.  After losing nearly $600,000 in 1995 and continuing to lose money in 1996, Imerman arranged for the league to take over team operations in June 1996.  In August 1996, Vincent Lu purchased the franchise.  In June 1998, the league suspended the team after Lu refused to sign a renewed franchise agreement with the league.  The A-League continued to operate the team, now known as the A-League Atlanta.  At the time Umbro had a promotional contract with the A-League and it contacted a local Atlanta law firm, Alston & Bird, about the possibility of litigation against the league and Lu.  However, this contact resulted in Alston & Bird lawyer John Latham purchasing the team along with his friend Bobby Glustrom.  In September 1998, Latham and Glustrom hired Mike Balson as general manager.  Balson then hired 1996 USISL Coach of the Year Nuno Piteira as head coach."]}, {"page": "Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u20131993)", "response": ["*6\u00a0\u2013  Mike Balson"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2019", "response": ["*Mike Balson, 71, English footballer (Exeter City and Highlands Park) and referee, complications from Lewy Body Dementia.Michael John Charles Balson"]}, {"page": "Balson", "response": ["*Mike Balson (1947\u20132019), English footballer"]}]}}
