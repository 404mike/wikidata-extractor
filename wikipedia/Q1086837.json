In that year he also met and mentored his future TMS colleague the late Christopher Martin-Jenkins, who sought his advice about how to become a cricket commentator while still at school. From 1965 onwards Johnston split his commentary duties between television (three Tests) and radio (two Tests) each summer. In 1970 Johnston was dropped from the TV commentary team and he retired from the BBC two years later on his sixtieth birthday. However, he continued to appear in a freelance capacity as a member of the team for the radio broadcasts, Test Match Special (TMS) for the next 22 years. Johnston was responsible for a number of the TMS traditions, including the creation, often using the so-called Oxford \"-er\", of the nicknames of fellow commentators (for example, Jonathan Agnew is still known as \"Aggers\", Henry Blofeld as \"Blowers\", and the late Bill Frindall (\"the Bearded Wonder\") as \"Bearders\"). He once complained on air that he had missed his cake at tea during one match, and was subsequently inundated with cakes from listeners.

According to Christopher Martin-Jenkins, his Cricinfo biography, and the biography by Johnston's son Barry, Johnston never actually made the remark. Barry Johnston says \"It was too good a pun to resist ... but Brian never actually said that he had spoken the words on air.\" Holding himself has expressed his doubt about the phrase ever being said, pointing out that no recording of it exists.
