Following the breakup of that band, he continued to collaborate with Lloyd Cole early in the singer's solo career, playing and co-writing on 1990s Lloyd Cole and 1991's Don't Get Weird on Me Babe.\nHe has since performed on other artists' recordings, including Del Amitri, Texas, the Hot Rod Cadets, the Kevin McDermott Orchestra, and Alisdair Robertson. His collaboration with Alisdair resulted in the album Confessions of a Justified Singer. He plays piano, keyboards, accordion, and melodica. In the 1990s, Cowan was a member and co-producer of Paul Quinn and the Independent Group on the revived Postcard Records.\nIn 2007 Blair played in Kevin McDermott's album, Wise to the Fade.In 2010, Blair collaborated on Lloyd Cole's Broken Record, co-writing Oh Genevieve.In 2019, Blair also collaborated on Lloyd Cole's Guesswork, teaming up with former Commotions bandmate, Neil Clark.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lloyd Cole", "response": ["Broken Record, released in September 2010 preceded by the single 'Writer's Retreat', marked a departure from his solo recordings, as it was performed by a band of longstanding friends and working partners, including Fred Maher, Joan Wasser, Rainy Orteca, Dave Derby and Blair Cowan \u2013 as well as two musicians, Matt Cullen (guitar; banjo) and Mark Schwaber (guitar; mandolin), with whom Cole tours, billed as 'Lloyd Cole Small Ensemble'. The recording of the album was entirely financed by advance purchases by his fans and contributions from Tapete Records, which later distributed the album and also oversaw and negotiated the rights to release a boxed set with his complete collection of b-sides, alternative takes and previously unreleased material, under the title Cleaning Out the Ashtrays.", "A further album co-funded by fans, Standards, was released in June 2013, and includes contributions from Fred Maher and Matthew Sweet, Blair Cowan (The Commotions) and Joan Wasser (a.k.a. Joan As Police Woman). It was preceded by the single and video 'Period Piece', which demonstrated Lloyd's return to a  rock-based band sound. Other notable songs on the album were Lloyd's re-make of John Hartford's 'California Earthquake', 'Women's Studies' and favourite 'Myrtle And Rose'. For the first time since 1999's 'The Collection', Lloyd Cole entered the UK album chart with the album.", "A new studio album, Guesswork, was released on 26 July 2019 by earMUSIC. Recorded (mostly) in his attic studio in Massachusetts, \u2018Guesswork\u2019 was produced by Lloyd and mixed by maverick German producer Olaf Opal, with executive production from Chris Hughes. The record was mastered by Kai Blankenberg at Skyline Tonfabrik in Dusseldorf. The electronic sounding album also featured contributions from a.o. Fred Maher and former Commotions Blair Cowan and Neil Clark. It was preceded by the singles 'Violins' and ' Night Sweats'. The former was accompanied by a video, as was album opener 'The Over Under', which gained a video directed by John Wood and Paul Harrison.

Cole eventually convinced the guitarist to tour but it would be the last time he would play with any band on the road. Cole later praised Quine for his contribution to the band's live performances, [He and] no-one else had my ear. We might as well have been called the Quine Band.
