During his career he developed strong views, and was especially critical of United States foreign policy in the Middle East and the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians. His stance earned him praise from many commentators, but was condemned by others.As an international correspondent, he covered the civil wars in Lebanon, Algeria, and Syria, the Iran\u2013Iraq conflict, the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Islamic revolution in Iran, Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, and the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. An Arabic speaker, he was among the few Western journalists to interview Osama bin Laden, which he did three times between 1993 and 1997.He began his journalistic career at the Newcastle Chronicle and then the Sunday Express. From there, he went to work for The Times as a correspondent in Northern Ireland, Portugal and the Middle East; in the last role, he based himself in Beirut intermittently from 1976. After 1989, he worked for The Independent. Fisk received many British and international journalism awards, including the Press Awards Foreign Reporter of the Year seven times.Books by Fisk include The Point of No Return (1975), In Time of War (1985), Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War (1990), The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East (2005), and Syria: Descent Into the Abyss (2015).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ariel Sharon", "response": ["Ariel Sharon criticised the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 as an act of \"brutal interventionism\".Ariel Sharon... by Robert Fisk Friday 6 January 2006, The Independent Sharon said both Serbia and Kosovo have been victims of violence.

From 1979 to 1992, the United States (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6\u201312 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). British journalist Jason Burke wrote that \"He did not receive any direct funding or training from the US during the 1980s. Nor did his followers. The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency, received large amounts of both. Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant.\" Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI. According to some CIA officers, beginning in early 1980, bin Laden acted as a liaison between the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) and Afghan warlords, but no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives. Steve Coll states that although bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, \"it seems clear that bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.\" Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S. Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed.Interview with FBI special agent Jack Cloonan , Frontline, PBS, October 18, 2005."]}, {"page": "The Times", "response": ["Robert Fisk, seven times British International Journalist of the Year, resigned as foreign correspondent in 1988 over what he saw as \"political censorship\" of his article on the shooting-down of Iran Air Flight 655 in July 1988.
