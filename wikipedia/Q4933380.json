He played as a centre forward.\nMcRoberts was born in Coatbridge, Scotland. He started his football career at Airdrieonians and Albion Rovers in the Scottish League, and went on to play for Gainsborough Trinity, Small Heath (Birmingham) and Chelsea, where he also played as a defender, in the Football League. He was Small Heath's leading goalscorer for three successive seasons, from 1899\u20131900 to 1901\u201302, and was Chelsea's first ever \u00a3100 signing, playing in their first League game in September 1905. On 4 November 1905, as Chelsea beat Barnsley 6\u20130 in a home league match, McRoberts scored the club's first-ever penalty.\nAfter retiring from playing, he came back to Birmingham where in July 1910 he was appointed their first full-time professional team manager. Previously the team had been selected by a committee. He managed the club for five years.\nMcRoberts died in Birkenhead, England, at the age of 84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McRoberts", "response": ["* Bob McRoberts (1874\u20131959), Scottish football player and manager", "* Bob McRoberts (American football) (1924\u20132012)"]}, {"page": "History of Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["Twenty-eight-year-old Scottish international half-back John Robertson was hired as player-manager. The club began with established players recruited from other teams; along with Foulke, Chelsea signed forwards Jimmy Windridge and Bob McRoberts from Small Heath, and Frank Pearson from Manchester City. Chelsea's first league match took place away at Stockport County on 2 September 1905. They lost the game 1\u20130. Their first home match was against Liverpool in a friendly. They won 4\u20130. Robertson also scored Chelsea's first competitive goal, coming in a 1\u20130 win against Blackpool."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Windridge", "response": ["Born in Small Heath, Birmingham, Windridge began his senior football career with his local club, Small Heath (now known as Birmingham City), making his debut in 1903. In his first season the club were promoted to the First Division.Matthews, p. 149. He became one of the first players to join the newly formed Chelsea Football Club in 1905, arriving for the sum of \u00a3190 and with fellow Small Heath players, Jimmy Robertson and Bob McRoberts. His impact was immediate, scoring a hat-trick for the club on his home debut against Hull City in the first competitive football match ever played at Stamford Bridge."]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City F.C. players", "response": ["Bob McRoberts, Billy Beer, George Liddell, Merrick, Garry Pendrey, Francis and Gary Rowett all went on to manage the team. Others took part in significant matches in club history. Billy Ollis, Jenkyns, Ted Devey, Jack Hallam, Wheldon and Tommy Hands appeared in Small Heath's first Football League match in 1892. Eight men listed here played in Birmingham's pioneering venture into club football in Europe in the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and ten played on the losing side in the 1956 FA Cup Final (an eleventh, Roy Warhurst, missed the match through injury). In more recent times, Paul Tait scored the first golden goal to decide a Wembley cup final, against Carlisle United in the 1995 Football League Trophy. Geoff Horsfield scored the extra-time equaliser that took the 2002 First Division play-off final into a shootout; Paul Devlin and Stan Lazaridis converted their spot-kicks as Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time. Seven men listed here, including captain Stephen Carr and goalscorer Nikola \u017digi\u0107, took the field as Birmingham won the 2011 League Cup; another two were unused substitutes. Just three years later, the first headed goal of full-back Paul Caddis's career, 93 minutes into the final match of the season, saved the team from relegation to the third tier of English football."]}, {"page": "Walter Wigmore", "response": ["He moved to newly elected Second Division club Gainsborough Trinity in 1896, where he struck up an excellent strike partnership with Bob McRoberts. In February 1899, terms were agreed for Wigmore to join The Wednesday, but reports that the transfer had taken place were premature, as the player rejected the move. A few weeks later, Small Heath paid a fee of \u00a3180 to reunite him with McRoberts. Tried at centre-half when Alex Leake was injured, he impressed so much that for nine years he remained first choice in that position, making the last of his 355 appearances for Birmingham only a few days before his 39th birthday. He was often penalised for dangerous play due to his unusual reluctance to head the ball, preferring to use his feet however high the ball came to him."]}, {"page": "History of Birmingham City F.C. (1875\u20131965)", "response": ["Two defeats at the end of the 1900\u201301 season deprived Small Heath of a second divisional title, but not of promotion as runners-up. They also reached the quarter-final of the FA Cup, losing to Aston Villa after a replay. The board's decision to reject Villa's offer of \"a big transfer fee and a benefit match in addition\" for the services of centre-forward Bob McRoberts was vindicated when he top-scored with 17 goals.Matthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 246\u201347. Average attendances rose from 5,500 to 13,000 for 1901\u201302,Matthews.

A fifth change of division in eleven seasons\u00a0\u2013 they reached the top two places by mid-November 1902 and remained there for the rest of the campaign\u00a0\u2013 gained Small Heath the reputation of a yo-yo club.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. p. 12. This time, a late run proved enough to keep them in the division, in contrast to 1904\u201305 when they reached second place in mid-February, one point behind Everton, but lost six of the last ten games to finish seventh.", "The Football Association used the ground for a semi-final of that season's FA Cup,Matthews. Encyclopedia. pp. 193\u201396. but Birmingham's play failed to live up to the new surroundings. They were relegated in 1907\u201308, prompting the resignation of Alf Jones, who had been secretary-manager since 1892. Successor Alex Watson's two seasons in charge ended with Birmingham bottom of the Second Division and having to apply for re-election to the league. After Hart's address, in which he stressed the club's age and longstanding league membership and assured his audience that inexperienced directors to whom the team's present position could be attributed had retired in favour of men of experience, the meeting voted Birmingham back into the league as top of the poll. Responsibility for team affairs passed to former player Bob McRoberts, who became the club's first dedicated team manager.Matthews. Encyclopedia. pp. 145\u201346. Birmingham remained in the second tier for the five seasons before League football was suspended because of the First World War."]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City F.C. managers", "response": ["There have been 39 full-time managers: the most recent appointee, Lee Bowyer, took over as head coach in March 2021. Bob McRoberts was appointed in 1910 as Birmingham's first manager whose role did not include secretarial duties. George Liddell has had the longest tenure, of six years and two months (267 matches) in the 1930s, while Trevor Francis has managed the team for most matches: 290 over five years and five months between 1996 and 2001. All three formerly played for the club. Under Arthur Turner, Birmingham won the 1954\u201355 Second Division title, followed up with what remains the team's highest league finish, sixth place in the 1955\u201356 First Division, and reached the 1956 FA Cup Final. Gil Merrick in 1963 and Alex McLeish in 2011 oversaw League Cup wins and Barry Fry led his team to a \"double\" of third-tier title and Football League Trophy in 1994\u201395.", "In the early days, team management was undertaken by a club committee. When payment of players was legalised in 1885, Alf Jones began to act as club secretary on a voluntary basis. Small Heath's election to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League in 1892 prompted the board of directors to appoint him as the club's first paid official, responsible as secretary-manager for matters on the field in addition to his administrative duties. In his first season the club won the inaugural Second Division championship, and gained promotion to the First Division for the first time the following year via the Test Match system. Jones's 16-year tenure saw three promotions and three relegations, after the last of which in 1908 he resigned. Successor Alex Watson's two seasons in charge ended with the club having to apply for re-election to the league and responsibility for team affairs passing to former player Bob McRoberts, who became the club's first dedicated team manager."]}]}}
