The character of Sue Widdowson was renamed Mary, and Sylvia's last name was changed to Kane. There were several amendments to the plot in the television adaptation: e.g. the red car was identified through the curiosity of a neighbour and her smart and observant deduction; Crowther did not die of the heart attack and his wife did not commit suicide; Crowther and Sylvia didn't have sex after he picked her up at the bus stop; the \"murder\" turned out to be more of an accident - Widdowson confronted Sylvia in the car park, knocked her to the ground, and Crowther unwittingly reversed over her in the car and drove off not knowing; and there was no sexual attack on the corpse by Sanders, only theft. The cast included John Thaw as Morse, Kevin Whately as Sergeant Lewis, Peter Woodthorpe as Max, Ingrid Lacey as Mary Widdowson, Jill Baker as Jennifer Coleby, Anthony Bate as Bernard Crowther, Terrence Hardiman as Clive Palmer, Shirley Dixon as Margaret Crowther, Fabia Drake as Mrs Jarman, Paul Geoffrey as Peter Newlove, Ian Sears as John Sanders, and Jenny Jay as Sylvia Kane."]}, {"page": "List of All Creatures Great and Small (1978\u20131990 TV series) characters", "response": ["*Plumb, Miss \u2014 Jenny Jay"]}]}}
