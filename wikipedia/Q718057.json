Warner stated that while many thinkers had been theorising sexuality from a non-heterosexual perspective for perhaps a century, queerness represented a distinctive contribution to social theory for precisely this reason. Lauren Berlant and Warner further developed these ideas in their seminal essay, \"Sex in Public.\" Berlant, Lauren, and Michael Warner.

Critics such as Edward Carpenter, Guy Hocquenghem and Jeffrey Weeks had emphasised what they called the \u2018necessity of thinking about sexuality as a field of power, as a historical mode of personality, and as the site of an often critical utopian aim\u2019. Whereas the terms 'homosexual', \u2018gay\u2019 or \u2018lesbian\u2019 which they used signified particular identities with stable referents (i.e to a certain cultural form, historical context, or political agenda whose meanings can be analysed sociologically), the word \u2018queer\u2019 is instead defined in relation to a range of practices, behaviours and issues that have meaning only in their shared contrast to categories which are alleged to be 'normal'. Such a focus highlights the indebtedness of queer theory to the concept of normalisation found in the sociology of deviance, particularly through the work of Michel Foucault, who studied the normalisation of heterosexuality in his work The History of Sexuality."]}, {"page": "Free love", "response": ["Free love was a central tenet of the philosophy of the Fellowship of the New Life, founded in 1883, by the Scottish intellectual Thomas Davidson.
