Daredevil creator Drew Goddard also serves as an executive producer on the miniseries, along with Karim Zreik, Cindy Holland, Allie Goss, Alison Engel, Kris Henigman, Alan Fine, Stan Lee, Joe Quesada, Jim Chory, and Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb. S. J. Clarkson, director of the miniseries' first two episodes, also serves as an executive producer on the first episode. In July 2016, Loeb confirmed that the miniseries would consist of eight episodes, and stated that Petrie and Ramirez would consult with Melissa Rosenberg, Cheo Hodari Coker, and Scott Buck\u2014the showrunners of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, respectively\u2014on how their characters would act; the other showrunners read each of the scripts for The Defenders and provided insight into each individual character's world. On this collaboration, Petrie said of Rosenberg specifically that she was \"wonderful because she's in this position of being a fellow artist and letting us do what we do, but at the same time loving her character and being protective of her character and wanting us to get it right\". Rosenberg said that she and the other showrunners \"felt really included in the process\". Loeb compared this relationship to Joss Whedon consulting with the filmmakers of the MCU's Phase One films before directing the crossover film The Avengers (2012). At the start of filming in October 2016, Petrie left the series as co-showrunner. Loeb explained, \"We got to a point where the scripts were done, and we wanted Marco to continue, and Doug pursued other avenues.\"", "Director S. J. Clarkson, cinematographer Matthew J. Lloyd, production designer Loren Weeks, and costume designer Stephanie Maslansky worked together to create distinct color palettes for each of the characters, maintaining the looks from their individual series, rather than attempting to blend the looks of all the different series for the miniseries. Maslansky explained that the palettes were used for the lighting, sets and locations, and costumes for the lead characters as well as extras. When the characters begin to crossover, so do the colors, and decisions were made regarding which colors come to the foreground and which are seen less on a scene-by-scene basis."]}, {"page": "S.J.

Colter was confirmed in the role the next month, having signed on for the series, and others, without reading any scripts, and being drawn to the series because of its opportunity to have character exploration, which he felt was lacking in the MCU films. He put on  of muscle for the role. Rosenberg noted that because Cage has his own series to explore who he is, she represents him as \"a man of few words\" rather than trying to say anything about who he is in particular. Colter was pleased and surprised that the audience \"got\" the character, as Luke \"was a man of few words and a lot of subtext,\" which \"was refreshing because we were going for this character in a way that said little but spoke volumes because of their past history together. I felt people got the subtleties.\" When Loeb described the character to Colter, he said \"that Luke doesn't have to try hard at anything. It just happens.\" This helped Colter form the character, along with using his opposite personal experience of having to work hard for everything. Colter also credited Rosenberg and S. J. Clarkson with helping him \"get on the right track\" with the character in the early episodes.

J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create \"unconventional\" compositions, with Billeter explaining, \"There were a lot of foreground elements [and] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia.\" Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and \"good composition\", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the \"warm, dirty color of sodium vapor\" for night exterior scenes."]}, {"page": "Collateral (TV series)", "response": ["Collateral is a four-part British television drama serial, written and created by David Hare, and directed by S.
