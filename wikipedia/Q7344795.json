Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate, Aileen Ward, and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity."]}, {"page": "Southsea", "response": ["*Robert Gittings, writer"]}, {"page": "1978 in literature", "response": ["*James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography: Robert Gittings, The Older Hardy"]}, {"page": "1931 in literature", "response": ["*Chancellor's Gold Medal: Robert Gittings"]}, {"page": "Ode on Indolence", "response": ["Keats's notes and papers do not reveal the precise dating of the 1819 odes.

It has been suggested that his \"Ode to a Nightingale\" was in part inspired by the Middle English poem, or by Dryden's modernization of it.Caroline F. E.

The musician and poet Sidney Lanier outdid them all when he declared \"The Floure and the Leafe\" was worth all the Canterbury Tales put together.  In 1868 scenes from the poem were represented in the memorial window (destroyed in World War II) placed above Chaucer's tomb in Westminster Abbey.Kathleen Forni The Chaucerian Apocrypha: A Counterfeit Canon (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2001) p. 138.  The same year, the scholar Henry Bradshaw gave reasons for thinking the poem to have been written too late to be Chaucer's work.  The pioneering Middle English scholar Thomas Tyrwhitt had published his own doubts as early as 1778, and been universally derided for this heresy.  Now, however, Bradshaw's judgement was seconded by ten Brink, who produced many arguments for rejecting it from the canon of Chaucer's works.D. A. Pearsall (ed.) The Floure and the Leafe; and, The Assembly of Ladies (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1980) pp. 13\u201314.  Attempts to counter these arguments were unavailing, and thereafter the poem had to make its own way in the world, without the protection of Chaucer's name.  The great philologist Walter Skeat accepted Bradshaw's judgement, and spoke of the poem's \"tinsel-like glitter\u2026which gives it a flashy attractiveness, in striking contrast to the easy grace of Chaucer's workmanship\".Walter W.
