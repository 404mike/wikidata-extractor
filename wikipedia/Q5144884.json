Six goals from 29 league games led to a transfer to Birmingham City in June 1955, but in two years at St Andrew's he was never to make a league appearance. In April 1957 he joined Torquay United, making his debut at centre forward on the opening day of the following season in a 3\u20130 defeat away to Colchester United.
