Unlike William Kennedy Dickson's 1899 film version of King John and Charles Urban's 1905 film of The Tempest, both of which were simply films of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's stage productions, Stow's film was a condensed version of the entire play set specifically for the camera and tells the backstory (the film's first four scenes are set before the play starts) of how Prospero arrived on the island, his first encounter with Caliban and the discovery of Ariel.Lisa Hopkins, Screen Adaptations: The Tempest: A Close Study of the Relationship Between Text and Film, Bloomsbury (2008) - Google Books pp. 37-38 Characters such as Duke Antonio are only sketched in while others such as Stephano and Trinculo do not appear at all and Percy Stow may have presumed that his audience would be familiar enough with the story to not require additional detail. The Tempest was filmed in the studio and on location.Grace Tiffany, The Tempest: Evans Shakespeare Edition, Wadsworth Learning (2012) - Google Books p. 65", "Running at 12 minutes long,The Tempest (1908) - Century Film Project intertitles are used to link the short scenes but do not use Shakespeare's own prose. Several elaborate scenes were filmed in the studio which drew on Percy Stow's trick-photography expertise, including where Prospero summons up the tempest, which the BFI describes as being reminiscent of the work of the French film pioneer Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. The scene where Ariel disappears and reappears while being chased by Ferdinand was achieved by simply using a jump cut - stopping filming and the actress moving in and out of shot. The scene is comic and emphasises the playful nature of Ariel but is also an effect that could not be replicated on stage giving the film an advantage over the theatre in what Judith Buchanan called an 'ambiguity of styles'.", "Category:Films directed by Percy Stow"]}, {"page": "Langford Reed", "response": ["*1906: Saved by a Lie directed by Percy Stow", "*1906: Saved by a Lie directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: Disturbing His Rest directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: The Wreck of the Mary Jane directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: The Story of a Modern Mother directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: Adventures of a Bath Chair directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: An Awkward Situation directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: The Water Babies directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: The Pied Piper directed by Percy Stow", "*1907: That's Not Right: Watch Me! directed by Percy Stow", "*1907]: An Anxious Day for Mother directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: The Little Waif and the Captain's Daughter directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: The Captain's Wives directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Three Maiden Ladies and a Bull directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Three Suburban Sportsmen and a Hat directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Mr. Jones Has a Tile Loose directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: If Women Were Policemen directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: The Old Composer and the Prima Donna directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Follow Your Leader and the Master Follows Last directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: The Cavalier's Wife directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Robin Hood and His Merry Men directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Nancy directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Algy's Yachting Party directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: The Tempest directed by Percy Stow", "*The Puritan Maid and the Royalist Refugee directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: A Modern Cinderella directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: When the Man in the Moon Seeks a Wife directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: The Old Favourite and the Ugly Golliwog directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: The Martyrdom of Thomas A Becket directed by Percy Stow", "*1908: Ib and Little Christina directed by Percy Stow", "*1909: The Love of a Nautch Girl directed by Percy Stow", "*1909: The Crafty Usurper and the Young King directed by Percy Stow", "*1909: His Work or His Wife directed by Percy Stow", "*1909: Hard Times directed by Percy Stow", "*1914: The Temptation of Joseph directed by Percy Stow"]}, {"page": "Willie and Tim in the Motor Car", "response": ["Willie and Tim in the Motor Car, also known as Fine Feathers Make Fine Birds is a 1905 British short silent comedy film directed by Percy Stow and produced by the Clarendon Film Company.
