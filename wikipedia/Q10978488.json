He was a powerful, if inconsistent bat and an occasional wicketkeeper, but he was best known as a right-arm fast bowler of fearsome pace and ability. Haygarth stated that his career, 'though rather short, must be considered most brilliant.' He was the first cricketer to appear in a cartoon in Punch.\nHe played for Nottinghamshire from 1855 to 1866 and also represented Kent in 1858.  In 1859, he took part in the first ever overseas cricket tour when he was a member of the England team visiting North America. He also toured Australia and New Zealand in 1863-64. During this trip, the team sailed from Liverpool to Melbourne on board the SS Great Britain.His overall first-class career record covered 115 matches.  He scored 1993 runs at an average of 12.61 with a highest score of 100.  He took 106 catches. Jackson took 655 wickets for 7491 runs at 11.52, taking 100 wickets in 1858 and 1860.  His best innings analysis was 9/27 and he took 5 wickets in an innings on 59 occasions and 10 wickets in a match 20 times. He was only 33 when he dropped out of County cricket and latterly appeared for local sides against the All England Eleven.\nJackson lived his later life in extreme poverty despite the County awarding a benefit of \u00a3300 in 1874. He died at Brownlow Hill, a Liverpool workhouse.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. G.

He bowled well and scored 32 off the bowling of John Jackson, George Tarrant and Cris Tinley. E. M. took ten wickets in the match, which Bristol and Didcot won by an innings, and as a result E.
