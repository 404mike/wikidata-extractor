In some sources, the ship is included in the squadron commanded by Mustafa Pasha (Adolphus Slade), but the historian Candan Badem notes that Slade did not record the ship as having been under his command and therefore discounts those reports that include her. The historians Bernd Langensiepen and Ahmet G\u00fclery\u00fcz concur with this assessment. After the war, the Ottoman Navy planned to refit the old sail ship of the line  with steam engines, but on inspection of the ship, it was determined that she had badly rotted and was not worth refitting. The engines that had been ordered were instead used to replace Mubir-i S\u00fcrurs worn-out machinery. At the start of the Cretan Revolt in early 1866, Mubir-i S\u00fcrur was stationed in Izmir; she was assigned to the European Division under Ferik Ethem Pasha. The division was used to patrol for Greek blockade runners supplying arms to the insurgents on Crete. By 1869, she had been transferred to the 3rd Squadron in the Asiatic Division. In 1873, the vessel was reduced to a training ship for naval cadets."]}, {"page": "Mushaver Pasha", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adolphus Slade"]}]}}
