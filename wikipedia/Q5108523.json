During his school years, he was a regular in Hampshire's youth teams, and played for the Liphook and Ripsley Cricket Club.\nWright made his first-class debut for Middlesex in 2004, as a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. He was born at Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire and is a product of the Middlesex Academy who has also represented Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence and the Tamil Union club.\nIn August 2007, he signed a two-year contract to play for Essex until the end of the 2009 season. In March 2009, this was extended until the end of the 2011 season. However, they allowed him to play for Warwickshire on loan in August 2011 who then made the move permanent.\nWright's career blossomed at his third club. In the 2012 season, Wright formed an impressive opening attack partnership with Keith Barker for Warwickshire, helping the side capture the County Championship. Wright took over 50 first-class wickets in the season. His success led him to a call up\nto the England Lions cricket team, and a new four-year contract with Warwickshire. However, in 2013 he suffered a stress-fracture of his back which hampered his progress.\nIn July 2018 it was announced that he would make the move at the end of the season to Leicestershire, as first-team opportunities at Warwickshire\nhad become scarce.In September 2021, during the 2021 County Championship, Wright took his 500th first-class wicket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|31|| Chris Wright* ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm fast-medium || "]}, {"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Middlesex Crusaders waved a definite good-bye to their hopes of a National League title, losing their second game in a row and failing to take advantage of Essex Eagles' loss the preceding day.
