Retrieved 12 June 2020.[Ideology] identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. Foucault's 'episteme' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life.Authors such as Michael Freeden have also recently incorporated a semantic analysis to the study of ideologies."]}, {"page": "Mansfield College, Oxford", "response": ["The theologian Albert Schweitzer was a special lecturer at the college and often performed on the chapel organ.

The minimum definition describes what Michael Freeden has called the \"core concept\" of the right-wing populist ideology, that is the concept shared by all parties generally included in the family. Looking at the primary literature, Mudde concludes that the core concept of right-populism \"is undoubtedly the \"nation\". \"This concept\", he explains, \"also certainly functions as a \"coat-hanger\" for most other ideological features. Consequently, the minimum definition of the party family should be based on the key concept, the nation\". He however rejects the use of \"nationalism\" as a \"core ideology\" of right-wing populism on the ground that there are also purely \"civic\" or \"liberal\" forms of nationalism, preferring instead the term \"nativism\": a xenophobic form of nationalism asserting that \"states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (\"the nation\"), and that non-native elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogeneous nation-state\". Mudde further argues that \"while nativism could include racist arguments, it can also be non-racist (including and excluding on the basis of culture or even religion)\", and that the term nativism does not reduce the parties to mere single-issue parties, such as the term \"anti-immigrant\" does. In the maximum definition, to nativism is added authoritarianism\u2014an attitude, not necessary anti-democratic or automatic, to prefer \"law and order\" and the submission to authority\u2014and populism\u2014a \"thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, \"the pure people\" versus \"the corrupt elite\", and which argues that politics should be an expression of the \"general will of the people\", if needed before human rights or constitutional guarantees. Cas Mudde and Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser reiterated in 2017 that within European right-wing populism there is a \"marriage of convenience\" of populism based on an \"ethnic and chauvinistic definition of the people\", authoritarianism, and nativism. This results in right-wing populism having a \"xenophobic nature.\""]}, {"page": "Philosophical anarchism", "response": ["Scholar Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates self-government with a \"progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others\".

The third type is \"found in Herbert Spencer's early predictions\" and in that of some of his disciples such as Wordsworth Donisthorpe, foreseeing in this sense \"the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution\".
