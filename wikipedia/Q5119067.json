They soon settled on a line-up consisting of Rhys on vocals and guitar, Ieuan on drums, his brother Cian Ciaran (formerly of WWZZ) on keyboards, Huw Bunford (formerly of U-Thant) on guitar and Guto Pryce on bass.

And we had some other really nice tunes so we just chose the best songs\". According to Rhys the only plan the group stuck to was to make a \"more coherent\" record: \"In the past ... we'd put ideas kind of side by side, and on this record we wanted all those sounds to be more blended\". Following arguments over the track listing of previous album Rings Around the World, after a \"lot of songs\" were recorded necessitating four months worth of discussions about which tracks to leave off the record, the group recorded just 16 largely acoustic based songs during the sessions for Phantom Power. Rhys's initial batch of songs were augmented by, among others, the Huw Bunford penned \"Sex, War & Robots\", the first time the guitarist had had one of his songs included on a Super Furry Animals album and also the first time he had sung lead vocals for the group, \"Slow Life\", which grew out of an electronic piece of music keyboardist Cian Ciaran had been working on for several years and \"The Piccolo Snare\" which was partly written in the studio.", "The album showcases an eclectic range of sounds from the country rock of \"Sex, War & Robots\", featuring pedal steel guitar, to the heavy metal and punk of \"Out of Control\" and the glam rock of first single \"Golden Retriever\". \"Slow Life\", a track which singer Gruff Rhys has described as the \"most sonically impressive\" song on Phantom Power, features techno influences and is based on a piece of electronic music written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran several years earlier. Ciaran encouraged the band to jam on top of his original track to produce a fusion of techno and guitar-pop. \"The Undefeated\" is inspired by ska and reggae music, although the group removed a \"cheesy white reggae\" section from the song because it sounded \"fucking horrible\" and actively tried not to make it sound too much like a ska or reggae track as they felt they \"couldn't pull it off\". Many tracks feature close vocal harmonies, with all the band apart from Pryce contributing. These harmonies give the album a California / West Coast of America feel, with comparisons being drawn to the work of The Beach Boys, particularly on the song \"Venus and Serena\".", "Keyboardist Cian Ciaran stated at the time of Phantom Power's release that the band would issue a DVD with every future album, claiming that \"this is just the way we make records now\". However, the band's next two albums, Love Kraft and Hey Venus!, were not made available on DVD and, in a 2008 interview with Uncut, Rhys suggested that the release had been something of a failure: \"no one gave a shit because people just want to rock n' roll!\"", "*Cian Ciaran \u2013 keyboards, guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Fuzzy Logic (Super Furry Animals album)", "response": ["*Cian Ciaran \u2013 keyboards, analogues, vocals, claps"]}, {"page": "Rings Around the World", "response": ["The album, which singer Gruff Rhys describes as \"a very ambitious project\", was recorded between April and September 2000 at Monnow Valley Studios in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales and Bearsville Studios, New York with the band acting as co-producers alongside Chris Shaw. The majority of the songs on Rings Around the World were written by Rhys on guitar and piano with keyboardist Cian Ciaran contributing \"[A] Touch Sensitive\" and \"Miniature\" as well as collaborating with other members of the band on \"Run! Christian, Run!\", \"Alternate Route to Vulcan Street\" and \"No Sympathy\". Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and former Velvet Underground member John Cale make cameo appearances on the album.", "Recording sessions began in April 2000 at Monnow Valley Studios in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales with co-producer Chris Shaw and engineer Eric Tew. The band moved to Bearsville Studios, New York before returning to Monnow Valley some months later where recording was completed in September 2000. Bearsville was chosen because of its drum and live rooms, which the band felt were desirable as they were using more microphones to capture audio for the surround sound mix included on the DVD version of the album than they would normally when simply recording in stereo. The group were mindful of the capabilities of surround sound and recorded sub-bass on tracks such as \"[A] Touch Sensitive\" and \"Juxtapozed with U\", which could only be heard through a low-frequency subwoofer channel in the surround mix. The band recorded onto two-inch analogue tape until they had a take they were happy with, then transferred the results to Pro Tools where individual songs were edited and overdubs were added. According to Keyboardist Cian Ciaran this meant the band could \"edit some beats very precisely ... like the gated kicks at the end of the track \"Sidewalk Serfer Girl\"\". Once they were happy with a song the group then transferred it back to tape before mixing took place as they liked the \"tape sound\".", "The track \"Receptacle For the Respectable\" reflects the eclecticism of the album as it \"undergoes a complete personality change\" over the course of its four-minute thirty-two-second duration, veering from prog rock to death metal. The song begins as an acoustic guitar-driven pop song and then shifts into a slower bridge section which leads to an even slower coda which has been compared to the music of Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys' Smiley Smile album and features Paul McCartney chewing carrots and celery to the beat. The track ends with a \"pantomime death metal\" section with Rhys's \"distorted, bellowed vocals\" screaming the title phrase. According to Cian Ciaran, the song initially comprised just the first two parts when recorded at Monnow Valley Studios but, by the time the group relocated to Bearsville Studios, Rhys had written and added the third section. While there the band added the fourth section by \"pissing about with Pro Tools\", looping the bass from the end of the third section \"by accident\" to create the musical backing. A fifth, hip hop, section was discussed but the band decided against it, reasoning that \"if you're going to do a fifth bit, you'd probably do a sixth, and before you know where you are, you're doing a concept album made up of nothing but bits!\". According to the band, the track is the only time on the album where they tried to achieve comedy and \"completely went with [their] silly streak\".", "keyboard player Cian Ciaran the group were worried that \"doing a DVD might seem elitist, because only certain people have DVD players and systems, even now\" but reasoned that \"most people will have DVD playback systems at home within five years. Even if it doesn't take off, the stereo version of the album will always be there\". The DVD release received a '15' certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, meaning that no-one under the age of 15 could buy or rent it in the United Kingdom.", "*Cian Ciaran \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Guerrilla (album)", "response": ["During recording, the band used a sampler for the first time and hired many different musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing \"the music to dictate itself\". The song \"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\" was written around the ringtone of a mobile phone with the rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. \"Some Things Come from Nothing\" came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was \"written and recorded simultaneously\" by the group. \"The Sound of Life Today\" is a 22-second sample of \"Some Things Come From Nothing\" played backwards \u2013 an accident that occurred when mixing engineer Chris Shaw rewound the mix and forgot to mute the tape machine . According to Rhys the band gave the track a \"really pompous title\" so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead get just a \"collection of noises\". \"Do or Die\", \"Fire in My Heart\" and \"Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy\" were written by Rhys while \"The Door to This House Remains Open\" developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for \"Northern Lites\" was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments \"lying around\" Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.", "Guerrilla features an eclectic mix of musical styles and has been described by Pitchfork as a combination of the group's techno roots and their more recent \"sunny guitar-pop\". The NME featured an interview with the Super Furry Animals, several weeks before the release of the album in the United Kingdom, as the lead article in an issue which discussed the \"nu-psychedelia\" musical genre, which they saw Guerrilla as exemplifying. Gruff Rhys has stated, however, that he sees the album as a quite conventional pop album, and that he associates psychedelia with improvisation whereas Guerrilla was \"almost entirely preconceived\". The singer has also said that the album is not a radical departure for the group musically, although it is \"more groovy and uptempo [...] more textured and punchy\" than the band's previous releases, partly due to the mix which creates a \"more American sound\". Spin stated that the record combines \"prog, glam, techno, and garage\" and is the \"gleeful missing link in the psych-prog continuum\". Select stated that the album juxtaposes pop songs with \"rambling odities\" and is dominated by the \"electronic throbs and pulses\" of keyboard player Cian Ciaran at the expense of guitarist Huw Bunford. The magazine went on to say that Gruff Rhys's voice anchors the record and gives life to songs which otherwise might seem to be works-in-progress, citing \"Chewing Chewing Gum\" as an example.", "*Cian Ciaran \u2013 keyboards, electronics, steel drums, drums, guitar, backing vocals, co-lead vocals on \"Chewing Chewing Gum\""]}, {"page": "Phantom Phorce", "response": ["*Cian Ciaran \u2013 Keyboards, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Ciar\u00e1n", "response": ["* Cian Ciaran (born 1976), Welsh keyboard player"]}, {"page": "Mwng", "response": ["The \"lo-fi\" Mwng was recorded over two weeks in late 1999, and\u2014in contrast with the \"excessive expense\" of Guerrilla\u2014cost just  to make.

The majority of Mwng was recorded  with Owen at Ofn Studios in Llanfaelog, Wales. According to Rhys, the band had to play in separate rooms to avoid the sound of one instrument bleeding onto the track of another during recording due to Ofn's small size. \"Y Gwyneb Iau\" and \"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" were recorded at Famous Studios in Cardiff, and were engineered by Greg Haver, while \"Y Teimlad\" was recorded at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, and was engineered by Michael Brennan, Jr. \"Sarn Helen\" was recorded and engineered by keyboardist Cian Ciaran in his living room. Overdubs for all songs were added at Ofn with Owen, who also mixed the album at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. Songs were recorded almost entirely live, with the band wanting to make a \"really immediate record\" as a reaction against the drawn out recording sessions for Guerilla and 1997's Radiator, which had taken several months and proved frustrating for the group. The version of \"Nythod Cacwn\" that appears on the album is the original demo, with  Rhys on drums. The band felt that, although the demo did not sound very professional, there was a warmth to it that would be impossible to recreate were the group to record the song again. The album's title translates into English as \"Mane\". According to Rhys, the band did not have the mane of a particular animal in mind, but felt it could be \"an extension of a Super Furry Animal\".", "Bassist Guto Pryce said that he feels Mwng \"sounds like an album\" rather than a collection of individual songs, due to the fact it was recorded live and over a short period of time. According to Rhys, Mwng marks a refining of the group's sound, with the band having \"sieved off\" their influences to truly sound like the Super Furry Animals for the first time. Rhys has said that, although keyboardist Cian Ciaran did not explore \"digital frontiers\" on the album, he was still able to \"deconstruct songs\", even when playing the harmonium. The band had previously thought of the saxophone as \"the instrument of Satan\", but actually used one on this record for the first time, reasoning that it was appropriate as Mwng is a \"darkish album\". Rhys described the album as the band's \"monochrome\" record, stating that it is \"less dressed up\" than their other releases, and that it is a \"good introduction to [the group's] songwriting.\"", "*Cian Ciaran \u2013 keyboards, harmonium, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Love Kraft", "response": ["The album represented a departure from the band's previous working methods: although all five members had always contributed to the development of the songs, Gruff Rhys had been the main songwriter.

The group also abandoned their usual practise of picking songs on their individual merit, instead choosing tracks that would work well together and \"create a sound that was as cohesive as possible\".

This arguably sealed the song's cult status among SFA fans, and it became the group's standard set-closer when playing live: the outro would often extend to ten or twenty minutes, with keyboard player Cian Ciaran in particular taking the opportunity to improvise wildly around the basic sample.

In contrast with many Super Furry Animals albums, no samplers were used during recording of Hey Venus! as the group made a conscious decision to create a \"simple record\" which \"capture[d] the spirit of the band playing live in a room\".
