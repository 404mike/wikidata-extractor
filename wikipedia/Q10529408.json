Born in Hebburn, he earned his nickname as a teenager while serving with the Cameron Highlanders and the 1st Battalion, Black Watch. He also served in South Africa during the Boer War.Wilson began his footballing career in Scotland with Raith Rovers. He left the Army to play professional football with Scottish Football League Division One side Dundee and later had a spell with Edinburgh club Heart of Midlothian. At the start of the 1905\u201306 season, Wilson moved to England to join Football League Second Division side Hull City. After scoring three goals in ten league matches, he was signed by Leeds City for a transfer fee of \u00a3150. During his first season at Leeds Wilson made 15 league appearances and scored 13 goals, making him the club's top scorer in the 1905\u201306 campaign.While playing for Leeds City against Burnley on 27 October 1906, Wilson left the pitch during the second half after suffering chest pains. When two of his teammates sustained injuries at the same time, he returned to the field of play against medical advice. However, he was unable to complete the match and had departed the pitch when Burnley inside forward Arthur Bell scored a late winner for the visitors. Wilson collapsed and had to be carried to the Leeds dressing room where he died despite efforts to resuscitate him. A subsequent post mortem found that Wilson had died from a heart attack.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Wilson", "response": ["* Soldier Wilson (David Wilson, 1883\u20131906), English footballer who played for Leeds City"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["*** Soldier Wilson (David) Soldier Wilson (1883\u20131906), English footballer who played for Leeds City"]}, {"page": "Arthur Bell (footballer)", "response": ["After missing the first three matches of the 1906\u201307 season due to cricketing commitments, Bell was chosen to replace McFarlane for the visit of Nottingham Forest on 15 September 1906. Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4\u20130 home win over Burton United, and went on to score three more goals in his next four appearances, including a late winner away at Leeds City. However, the victory was overshadowed by the news that Leeds forward Soldier Wilson had died after collapsing during the match. Bell went on to score a total of 12 goals in 1906\u201307, his highest return in a single season. His performances for Burnley led to a call-up from the England amateur team in April 1907, and he won his first cap in the 8\u20131 defeat of the Netherlands in The Hague, scoring two goals. In the match, he played alongside full England internationals Harold Hardman and Vivian Woodward, who, like Bell, was a professional architect.Simpson (2007), p. 107 Bell was selected again for England against the same opposition on 21 December 1907, this time scoring a hat-trick in a 12\u20132 victory. He was also part of Great Britain's squad for the football tournament at the 1908 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches."]}, {"page": "David \"Soldier\" Wilson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Soldier Wilson"]}]}}
