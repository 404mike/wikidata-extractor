The show followed a total of fourteen celebrity contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom built House. Each week, one or more of the housemates were eliminated from the competition by public vote and left the House. The last remaining housemate, Shilpa Shetty, was declared the winner and she received \u00a3100,000.\nThe series launched on Channel 4 on 3 January 2007 and ended on 28 January 2007. Davina McCall returned as presenter, having presented both the regular edition and the celebrity edition of Big Brother since they first began. Eleven housemates entered on launch night, with an additional three being introduced two days later. The series was watched by an average of 4.6 million viewers, the third highest viewed series of the show to date. As with the previous regular series, it was broadcast in 16:9 aspect ratio, as opposed to 4:3 \u2013 the first series of Celebrity Big Brother to do so.\nThe series saw the return of Jade Goody, who had become a media celebrity after appearing on the third regular series of Big Brother in 2002, arriving with her boyfriend and her mother \u2013 marking the first time in any series of Big Brother UK where family members entered together. During its original broadcast, Celebrity Big Brother 5 had become the subject of an internationally publicised racism controversy. It attracted the largest number of complaints to the UK media regulator Ofcom about a Big Brother series and, as of 2018, the second highest number of complaints about any British television broadcast of all time (after Jerry Springer: The Opera). Viewer complaints and press attention concerned housemate Shilpa Shetty, and alleged that she was the subject of racist bullying from some of her fellow housemates, in particular Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara. As a result, a protest took place in India; tensions increased between the UK and Indian governments; and a diplomatic incident occurred. Following the broadcast of the series, Ofcom concluded that Celebrity Big Brother 5 had breached the Broadcasting Code, and statutory sanctions were placed on Channel 4.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celebrity Big Brother (British series 5) racism controversy", "response": ["The fifth UK series of Celebrity Big Brother began on Wednesday 3 January 2007.  On the first day, eleven celebrity housemates entered the Big Brother House, including model Danielle Lloyd, S Club 7 singer Jo O'Meara and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. Then, on Friday 5, former Big Brother housemate Jade Goody entered the house, accompanied by her boyfriend Jack Tweed and her mother Jackiey Budden. Each day, Channel 4 broadcast a daily \"highlights\" show, featuring selected events of the previous 24 hours in the House, which itself was repeated the following morning, although offensive language and other potentially objectionable content was removed for pre-watershed broadcasting.", "During Budden's stay in the house, she and Shetty clashed on numerous occasions. Budden claimed that she was unable to pronounce the name \"Shilpa\", and referred to Shetty as \"Princess\" and \"the Indian\". During her eviction interview on Wednesday 10 January, after Budden used the term \"the Indian\", presenter Davina McCall did not question her use of the term \u2013 but focussed instead on Budden's failure to pronounce \"Shilpa\" properly. After Budden's eviction, Goody's boyfriend Jack Tweed called Shetty a \"cunt\", which was bleeped for broadcast, and a wanker. The night that Carole Malone was evicted, Lloyd referred to Shetty as a \"dog\".", "Channel Four also confidentially supplied Ofcom with uncensored and untransmitted material from the programme. Firstly, this clarified Jack Tweed's use of the word \"cunt\", and not the word \"Paki\" which had been reported. However, this also revealed conversations that took place between Goody, Lloyd, O'Meara and Tweed on Tuesday 16 January 2007, a few hours after the \"Oxo cube\" row between Goody and Shetty. In the first conversation, they discussed whether \"the P word\" had been used by any housemate (which Jack clarified by saying \"It rhymes with tacky\"). In subsequent conversations, they created limericks which featured the rhyming words \"tacky\", \"happy\", \"nappy\", \"crappy\", \"yappy\" and \"strappy\". These conversations, which were never broadcast, led to Big Brother issuing formal warnings to O'Meara and Tweed in the Diary Room, threatening immediate ejection from the House if their behaviour recurred."]}, {"page": "Shilpa Shetty", "response": ["After Shetty had attempted to dispose of the left-over chicken soup down the toilet and had caused a blockage, housemate Jack Tweed suggested that she should pick the bones out with her teeth and allegedly referred to her as a \"fucking Paki\", although show producers denied this and stated that the word used was \"cunt\". During a fierce argument, Goody told Shetty that she needed to \"spend a day in the slums\", although the media falsely reported this as \"go back to the slums\". Claiming that she did not know Shilpa's surname, Goody referred to her as \"Shilpa Fuckawallah\", \"Shilpa Daroopa\", and \"Shilpa Poppadom\", later claiming that they were non-racist references to Indian food. Lloyd had opined that Shetty's English-speaking skills were lacking and said she should \"fuck off home\"."]}, {"page": "2009 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**TV personality, Jade Goody and her boyfriend, Jack Tweed, are married at Down Hall, Essex.
