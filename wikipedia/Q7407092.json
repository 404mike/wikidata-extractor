Opened in 1958 on Oxford Road, Reading, it had just 11 seats.

It created the Piper brand, and after the failure of Sam Alper's Caravans International bought its brands, including: ACE, Abbey, Bessacarr, Sprite; and later the independent Cotswold brand. However, in the 1990s they began concentrating on static caravans, and sold off many of the touring caravan brand to the rival Swift Leisure. In the mid-2000s and looking to sell the Leisure business, the division was eventually sold to Leeds-based turnaround specialists Endless Fund, but collapsed into administration 12months later. After losing 240 jobs and one factory, it was bought by a management team and renamed Cosalt Custom Homes, preserving 20jobs."]}, {"page": "Yardley Court", "response": ["* Sam Alper, inventor and restaurateur.
