He was first noted in 1974 for a book of reportage Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors, later adapted as a feature-film and a documentary. Read was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge where he studied history.\nAmong his most popular works are The Professor's Daughter, A Married Man, and A Season in the West. In addition to his written works, Read is also a dramatist and television scriptwriter. In recent years, he has produced a number of authorized biographies and popular history books which are intended for a general audience. Read has worked and lived in both the United Kingdom and the United States, where he published many of his recent works. Read was awarded the Sir Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for The Junkers; the Hawthornden Prize and Somerset Maugham Award for Monk Dawson; the Thomas More Medal for Alive; the Enid McLeod Award for The Free Frenchman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cistercians", "response": ["By far the most influential of the early Cistercians was Bernard of Clairvaux. According to the historian Piers Paul Read, his vocation to the order, by deciding \"to choose the narrowest gate and steepest path to the Kingdom of Heaven at Citeaux demonstrates the purity of his vocation\".Read, p 96  His piety and asceticism \"qualified him to act as the conscience of Christendom, constantly chastising the rich and powerful and championing the pure and weak.\"  He rebuked the moderate and conciliatory Abbot Peter the Venerable for the pleasant life of the Benedictine monks of Cluny.  Besides his piety, Bernard was an outstanding intellectual, which he demonstrated in his sermons on Grace, Free will and the Song of Songs.  He perceived the attraction of evil not simply as lying in the obvious lure of wealth and worldly power, but in the \"subtler and ultimately more pernicious attraction of false ideas\".  He was quick to recognise heretical ideas, and in 1141 and 1145 respectively, he accused the celebrated scholastic theologian Peter Abelard and the popular preacher Henry of Lausanne of heresy.  He was also charged with the task of promulgating Pope Eugene's bull,  Quantum praedecessores, and his eloquence in preaching the Second Crusade had the desired effect: when he finished his sermon, so many men were ready to take the Cross that Bernard had to cut his habit into strips of cloth.Read, p 119"]}, {"page": "List of biographers", "response": ["*Piers Paul Read (En, born 1941) \u2013 Alec Guinness"]}, {"page": "Dreyfus affair", "response": ["* 2012  Piers Paul Read, The Dreyfus Affair, Bloomsbury, London"]}, {"page": "Opus Dei", "response": ["Criticisms against Opus Dei have prompted Catholic scholars and writers like Piers Paul Read and Vittorio Messori to call Opus Dei a sign of contradiction, in reference to the biblical quote of Jesus as a \"sign that is spoken against\".

He first made contact with 'The Ulsterman' in a meeting set up by Brian Field in Finsbury Park. Of Northern Irish descent, Goody was born in Putney, London in March 1930 and was still living there in his mother's flat at the time of the robbery.  In the early 1960s, he joined Buster Edwards' gang and helped rob various easy targets.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read (Pp 13\u201317)", "Ronald Christopher Edwards was born on 27 January 1932 at Lambeth, London, the son of a barman. After leaving school, he worked in a sausage factory, where he began his criminal career by stealing meat to sell on the post-war black market.  During his national service in the RAF he was detained for stealing cigarettes. When he returned to South London, he ran a drinking club and became a professional criminal.  He married June Rose in 1952.  They had a daughter, Nicky.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read In his final years he ran a flower stall outside Waterloo station in London.", "Field later became a solicitor's managing clerk for John Wheater & Co.  Although he was only 28 at the time of the robbery, he was already apparently more prosperous than his boss, John Wheater.  Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house, \"Kabri\" (an amalgam of Karin and Brian [Field]), with his wife at the Bridle Path, Whitchurch Hill, Oxfordshire, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a run-down neighbourhood.  Part of the reason for Field's prosperity was that he was not averse to giving Goody and Edwards information about what his clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves. On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where his wife Karin had once been a nanny.Piers Paul Read The Train Robbers (1978), pp.27\u201329", "Leonard \"Lennie\" Denis Field (born 1931, date of death unknown) helped with the purchase of the Leatherslade Farm hideout, paying the deposit of \u00a35,000 in return for a 'drink' of \u00a312,000. Lennie Field was allowed to think that the plan was to hijack a lorry load of cigarettes.The Train Robbers, Piers Paul Read, P.74 Despite not being in on the robbery, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and five years for obstructing justice), which was later reduced to five. He was released from jail in 1967 and went to live in north London.", "On 11 February 1964, there was a sensation when John Daly was found to have no case to answer. His counsel, Walter Raeburn QC, claimed that the evidence against his client was limited to his fingerprints being on the Monopoly set found at Leatherslade Farm and the fact that he went underground after the robbery. Raeburn went on to say that Daly had played the Monopoly game with his brother-in-law Bruce Reynolds earlier in 1963, and that he had gone underground only because he was associated with people publicly sought by the police. This was not proof of involvement in a conspiracy. The judge agreed, and the jury was directed to acquit him.The Train Robbers (Piers Paul Read) (1978)", "Brian Field was only reluctantly acquitted of the robbery.  Justice Atkinson stated that he would not be surprised if Field were not only part of the conspiracy, but also one of the robbers.  The charges against the other men were all upheld.  In the end, Lennie Field and Bill Boal got some measure of justice, but Boal died in prison in 1970 after a long illness.The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (1976)", "Jimmy White \u2013 With the other robbers on the run and having fled the country, only White was at large in the United Kingdom. White was a renowned locksmith/thief and had already been on the run for 10 years before the robbery. He was said to have \"a remarkable ability to be invisible, to merge with his surroundings and become the ultimate Mr Nobody.\" He was a wartime paratrooper and a veteran of Arnhem. According to Piers Paul Read in his 1978 book The Train Robbers, he was \"a solitary thief, not known to work with either firm, he should have had a good chance of remaining undetected altogether, yet was known to be one of the Train Robbers almost at once\u2014first by other criminals and then by the police\". He was unfortunate in that Brian Field's relatives had dumped luggage containing \u00a3100,000 only a mile from a site where White had bought a caravan and hidden \u00a330,000 in the panelling. In addition, a group of men purporting to be from the Flying Squad broke into his flat and took a briefcase containing \u00a38,500. Throughout his three years on the run with wife Sheree and baby son Stephen, he was taken advantage of or let down by friends and associates. On 10 April 1966, a new friend recognised him from photos in a newspaper and informed the police. They arrested him at Littlestone while he was at home. He only had \u00a38,000 to hand back to them. The rest was long gone. He was tried in June 1966 at Leicester Assizes and Mr Justice Nield sentenced him to 18 years' jail, considerably less than the 30 years given to other principal offenders.", "Bob Welch (born March 1929) was released on 14 June 1976.  He was the last of those convicted in Aylesbury to be released.  Welch moved back in with his wife June and his son.  He threatened the man left in charge of his share of the theft to retrieve the remainder.  A leg injury sustained in prison forced him to undergo several operations, which left him disabled.The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (Pp239-242)", "He was released from prison on 23 December 1975, aged 46 and went to live with his ill mother in her small cottage in Putney. Unlike the other robbers, he was exceptionally lucky in that the man he left in charge of his affairs was loyal and successful so he was able to live a relatively well-off life.The Train Robbers, by Piers Paul Read (1978) In his final years of incarceration Goody had taken full benefit of the newly established education college at Wormwood Scrubbs and studied Spanish to GCE standard.", "Both Piers Paul Read and Bruce Reynolds refer to three robbers who got away as Bill Jennings, Alf Thomas and Frank Monroe.", "Piers Paul Read refers to this man as Bill Jennings in The Train Robbers, while Bruce Reynolds adds a nickname, 'Flossy'. Ronnie Biggs refers to him as Mr One, as do other accounts. According to Bruce Reynolds, \"Flossy had no previous convictions and stayed well out of contact with the group. A shadowy figure, nobody knew exactly where he lived\u2014or even what his real name was. All we knew that he was one hundred per cent, and was sure to last out the hullabaloo. The last report of him said that he was in a safe house, banged up with two gorgeous girls and enough champagne to sink a battleship.\"Crossing the Line\u00a0\u2014 The Autobiography of a Thief, Bruce Reynolds, Page 217", "Piers Paul Read called the replacement train driver \"Stan Agate\", and Stan was apparently the true nickname of the replacement driver. Read, concerned that the robbers may have hurt him, went to see Ronnie Biggs in Brazil to get his details, although was dismayed to find that Biggs did not know his last name and knew and cared very little about him. With the meagre details provided, Read used a detective agency to track down the driver at a town 20 miles south of London, and found that he was still alive, although somewhat senile and being cared for by his wife. The wife admitted that she had burnt all the clothes that he had worn that night, and had nervously waited for either the gang to murder him or the police to arrest him. Read promised not to reveal their identities.The Train Robbers, Piers Paul Read, Pages 269-271 Unlike the other three members of the gang who got away, Peta Fordham does make mention of the replacement driver, but notes that he is said now to be dead, perhaps the robbers who provided material for the book did not want the police looking for him, as at the time of publishing (1965) Reynolds, White and Edwards were still on the run.The Robbers' Tale, Peta Fordham, Page 78", "John Wheater was released from prison on 11 February 1966 and managed his family's laundry business in Harrogate.The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (Pp 235 & 245) He later wrote two articles in the Sunday Telegraph, which published the first one on 6 March 1966. He died in July 1985.", "The \u00a347,245 recovered from a telephone box included 57 notes whose serial numbers had been recorded by the bank in Scotland. This money was part of a deal struck with Frank Williams by Danny Pembroke.  Piers Paul Read, in The Train Robbers, claimed that the police were feeling the pressure because although they had caught many of the robbers, they had failed to recover much of the money.  While no evidence had been found against Pembroke, who was believed to have been one of the South Coast Raiders, some of the identifiable bank notes had been traced back to him through friends who had been charged with receiving. Given that the police had insufficient evidence against Pembroke, either at Leatherslade Farm or definitive connection with either of the two gangs, Butler was prepared to let him go.  Williams convinced Butler to pull Pembroke in for questioning and in return for releasing him and not charging his friends with more serious crimes, \u00a350,000 was to be returned.", "On 3 December 1963, which happened to be the same day that Roy James was taken into custody, the police received an anonymous tip directing them to the money in the phone box. The money was driven up to Aylesbury and taken into custody by Detective Superintendent Fewtrell, who wondered how his London colleagues could know how much money there was.  He had to bring in bank clerks to count the damp and musty money to determine the final sum.Piers Paul Read The Train Robbers (1978), pp.142\u2013143", "According to Marilyn Wisbey, her father's share was hidden by his father Tommy Wisbey Senior in the panels in the doors of his home. Butler raided them three times but he never found the train money. The majority of the money was reputedly entrusted to Wisbey's father and also to his younger brother Ron, who coincidentally had saved some money of his own that was confiscated by the police and returned to Ron three months later. By the time Wisbey was released from jail all of his share had either been spent or invested. Marilyn agrees with Piers Paul Read's assessment of how her father's share of approximately \u00a3150,000 was spent. Although the Wisbey share was one that was not taken by other criminals, Marilyn Wisbey is still bitter that her relatives got to spend a fair amount of the loot while the overall sum dwindled away. However, her grandfather used some of the money to buy them a house in Upper Norwood.Gangster's Moll (2001) by Marilyn Wisbey (Chapter 6 The Pubs, Pp 69\u201371)", "Up to six of the robbers escaped punishment in one way or another - \"The Ulsterman\", three robbers who were never caught, John Daly who had his charges dismissed at the trial and Ronnie Biggs who escaped from jail and managed to avoid being taken back to the UK. Daly had entrusted his money to another crook. This man had betrayed him to the police and had absconded with the money. He died before Daly could catch up with him. Upon the release of the others in the mid-1970s, \"Bill Jennings\" got in touch with Buster Edwards and \"Frank Monroe\" got in touch with the South Coast Raiders. Both said that they had no money left. Danny Pembroke went initially to America and John Daly at the time was said to be living on unemployment benefits in the west of England.The Train Robbers (1978), Piers Paul Read, Pp244-245 Ronnie Biggs quickly spent his share getting a new life. He loved his new life in Australia, although by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but \u00a37,000 had been spent. \u00a355,000 had been paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK. The rest had gone on legal fees and expenses.Odd Man Out, Ronnie Biggs", "* The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read and first published by W.H. Allen and Company (). This book recounts a very detailed version of the story based on an exclusive account given by eight of the then-paroled robbers (Edwards, Goody, Hussey, Wisby, Welch, James, White and Cordrey with contradictory versions by Reynolds and Biggs). Despite revealing more than previous accounts, the book is flawed in that it includes inaccuracies that the funding source for the heist was former SS officer Otto Skorzeny.
