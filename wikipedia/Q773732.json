From filmography to modelling, the former Miss World has sustainably maintained her fame with an overwhelming influence. Her story has eventually become a tale of both struggles and accomplishments.", "As a student, she lived in Huis Asterhof (formerly Vergeet-my-nie) whilst studying drama at the University of Pretoria. Kriel made one film called \"Somer\" which was a set book for schools written by CM van den Heever. She also made a television short story in Afrikaans, called \"Storieboekmoord\". Whilst at university, she became Rag Queen and entered the Miss South Africa competition and won the Miss Northern Transvaal Competition. She won the Miss South Africa title in 1974, and then became Miss World (after initially holding second place) when Helen Morgan of the UK stepped down after just four days."]}]}}
