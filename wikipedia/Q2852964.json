Chronologically dating the archeological findings of hoplite armour and using the findings to approximate the development of the phalanx formation, Snodgrass claims that the transition took approximately 100 years to complete from 750\u2013650 BC. The progression of the phalanx took time because as the phalanx matured it required denser formations that made the elite warriors recruit Greek citizens. The large amounts of hoplite armour needed to then be distributed to the populations of Greek citizens only increased the time for the phalanx to be implemented. Snodgrass believes, only once the armour was in place that the phalanx formation became popular."]}, {"page": "Iron Age", "response": ["Modern archaeological evidence identifies the start of large-scale iron production in around 1200\u00a0 BC, marking the end of the Bronze Age.

Anthony SnodgrassA.M.Snodgrass (1966), \"Arms and Armour of the Greeks\". (Thames & Hudson, London)A.M. Snodgrass (1971), \"The Dark Age of Greece\" (Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh). suggests that a shortage of tin, as a part of the Bronze Age Collapse and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300\u00a0 BC, forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze. As evidence, many bronze implements were recycled into weapons during that time. More widespread use of iron led to improved steel-making technology at a lower cost. Thus, even when tin became available again, iron was cheaper, stronger and lighter, and forged iron implements superseded cast bronze tools permanently.Theodore Wertime and J.D. Muhly, eds.
