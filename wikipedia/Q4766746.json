Before retiring she worked at the Polytechnic of North London, where she was Senior Lecturer in Medieval History. She is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and a research fellow at the University of East Anglia. Her numerous works include:\n\nA Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain: England, Scotland, and Wales, c.500\u2013c.1050, Routledge (1991), with Alfred P. Smyth and D. P. Kirby.

His second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, had two sons, \u00c6lfweard, who may have been acknowledged in Wessex as king when his father died in 924 but who died less than a month later, and Edwin, who drowned in 933. In about 919 Edward married Eadgifu, the daughter of Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent, who had died in 902 at the Battle of the Holme. Edmund, who was born in 920 or 921, was Eadgifu's elder son. Her younger son Eadred succeeded him as king. Edmund had one or two full sisters. Eadburh was a nun at Winchester who was later venerated as a saint. The twelfth-century historian William of Malmesbury gives Edmund a second full sister who married Louis, prince of Aquitaine; she was called Eadgifu, the same name as her mother. William's account is accepted by the historians Ann Williams and Sean Miller, but \u00c6thelstan's biographer, Sarah Foot argues that she did not exist, and that William confused her with \u00c6lfgifu, a daughter of \u00c6lffl\u00e6d."]}, {"page": "Godwin, Earl of Wessex", "response": ["After Cnut seized the throne in 1016, Godwin's rise was rapid. By 1018 he was an earl, probably of eastern Wessex, and then by around 1020 of all Wessex.Ann Williams, Godwine, Oxford Online Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 Between 1019 and 1023 he accompanied Cnut on an expedition to Denmark, where he distinguished himself, and shortly afterwards married Gytha, the sister of the Danish earl, Ulf, who was married to Cnut's sister, Estrid.Pauline Stafford, 'Edith, Edward's Wife and Queen', in Richard Mortimer ed., Edward the Confessor: The Man and the Legend, The Boydell Press, 2009, p. 121"]}, {"page": "Edward the Confessor", "response": ["Edward displayed a worldly attitude in his church appointments. When he appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1051, he chose the leading craftsman Spearhafoc to replace Robert as Bishop of London. Robert refused to consecrate him, saying that the pope had forbidden it, but Spearhafoc occupied the bishopric for several months with Edward's support. After the Godwins fled the country, Edward expelled Spearhafoc, who fled with a large store of gold and gems which he had been given to make Edward a crown. Stigand was the first archbishop of Canterbury not to be a monk in almost a hundred years, and he was said to have been excommunicated by several popes because he held Canterbury and Winchester in plurality. Several bishops sought consecration abroad because of the irregularity of Stigand's position. Edward usually preferred clerks to monks for the most important and richest bishoprics, and he probably accepted gifts from candidates for bishoprics and abbacies. However, his appointments were generally respectable. When Odda of Deerhurst died without heirs in 1056, Edward seized lands which Odda had granted to Pershore Abbey and gave them to his Westminster foundation; historian Ann Williams observes that \"the Confessor did not in the 11th century have the saintly reputation which he later enjoyed, largely through the efforts of the Westminster monks themselves\"."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d", "response": ["In 865 the Viking Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to buy peace and the following year the Vikings invaded Northumbria, where they appointed a puppet king in 867. They then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867\u2013868. King Burgred of Mercia was joined by King \u00c6thelred of Wessex and his brother, the future King Alfred, for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Vikings conquered East Anglia. In 874 the Vikings expelled King Burgred and Ceolwulf became the last King of Mercia with their support. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. He was described by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as \"a foolish king's thegn\" who was a puppet of the Vikings. The historian Ann Williams regards this view as partial and distorted, that he was accepted as a true king by the Mercians and by King Alfred. The situation was transformed the following year when Alfred won a decisive victory over the Danes at the Battle of Edington."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelstan", "response": ["According to Michael Wood: \"Among all the great rulers of British history, \u00c6thelstan today is the forgotten man\",Wood, \"Aethelstan: The First King of England\" and in medieval historian Ann Williams's view: \"If \u00c6thelstan has not had the reputation which accrued to his grandfather, the fault lies in the surviving sources; \u00c6thelstan had no biographer, and the Chronicle for his reign is scanty. In his own day he was 'the roof-tree of the honour of the western world."]}, {"page": "Eric Bloodaxe", "response": ["The nature of Eric's relationship with Archbishop Wulfstan, the leading Northumbrian churchman who played such a decisive role in Amla\u00edb's career in the early 940s, remains tantalisingly unclear. One might assume that Wulfstan, given his political eminence, headed the Northumbrian party which elected Eric. It has likewise been suggested that Eadred's punitive attack on the ancient minster of Ripon, which carried little military weight, was targeted at Wulfstan in particular.Ann Williams, \"Eadred\". In what sense his deposition in 948 may have affected the relationship in later years is more open to speculation."]}, {"page": "Dark Ages (historiography)", "response": ["However, from the later 20th century onward, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons. Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so. Secondly, 20th-century scholarship had increased understanding of the history and culture of the period,Welch, Martin (1993). Discovering Anglo-Saxon England . University Park, PA: Penn State Press. to such an extent that it is no longer really 'dark' to us. To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians now avoid it altogether.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica \"It is now rarely used by historians because of the value judgment it implies. Though sometimes taken to derive its meaning from the fact that little was then known about the period, the term's more usual and pejorative sense is of a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity.\" It was occasionally used up to the 1990s by historians of early medieval Britain, for example in the title of the 1991 book by Ann Williams, Alfred Smyth and D. P. Kirby, A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain, England, Scotland and Wales, c.500-c.1050, and in the comment by Richard Abels in 1998 that the greatness of Alfred the Great \"was the greatness of a Dark Age king\". In 2020, John Blair, Stephen Rippon and Christopher Smart observed that: \"The days when archaeologists and historians referred to the fifth to the tenth centuries as the 'Dark Ages' are long gone, and the material culture produced during that period demonstrates a high degree of sophistication.\""]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred of Mercia", "response": ["\u00c6thelred had at least one son, Ceolred. According to the thirteenth-century Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, Ceolred was not the son of Osthryth, although it does not name Ceolred's mother, and in the view of the historian Ann Williams this may mean that \u00c6thelred remarried after Osthryth's death. However, Susan Kelly states that Osthryth was \"most likely (though not certainly)\" Ceolred's mother. Ceolred succeeded to the throne in 709, after Coenred abdicated in 709 to go to Rome on pilgrimage.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p.\u00a0128.Kelly, \"Osthryth\" One version of the regnal lists for Mercia shows a king named Ceolwald reigning after Ceolred, and it is possible that Ceolwald, if he existed, was also a son of \u00c6thelred's."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians", "response": ["In 865, the Viking Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia, and used it as a starting point for an invasion.
