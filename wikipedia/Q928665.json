Dunfermline were controlling the game until, against the run off play, Hibs scored. A throw-in on the right, just inside Dunfermline's half, was flicked on to Ivan Sproule, who walked through some poor defending to easily slot home. Hibs then took charge of the game and Paul Gallacher had to make a super one-on-one save from Garry O'Connor. However, in the second half O'Connor's shot, after being allowed to turn by Austin McCann, deflected off Keddie and past the hapless Gallacher. Dunfermline then attacked and were rewarded under two minutes later after Ryan Thomson powered through the Hibs team and finished well. A Joe Cardle drive was then parried out to J. Thomson who scuffed his shot off Paul Hanlon and into the net. Dunfermline nearly won the game with attempts from Cardle, Andrew Barrowman and the impressive David Graham, all not finding the goal.
