No England goal came\u2014the United States won 1\u20130 in what entered English football history as the national team's most embarrassing upset. Ramsey, who was fiercely patriotic, took the result as an acute personal humiliation. One journalist recalled that on hearing the match mentioned years later, \"his face creased and he looked like a man who had been jabbed in an unhealed wound\". England could remain in the competition if they beat Spain in their last group game, but a 1\u20130 defeat saw them crash out.", "Ramsey had made up his mind that he wanted to remain in football as a coach, but he had no relevant qualifications or managerial experience, bar a part-time coaching spell at London League club Eton Manor. While he spent the 1955 off-season coaching in Southern Rhodesia, Ipswich Town of the Third Division South received permission from Anderson to speak to Ramsey about signing him as player-manager. When Ramsey met the Ipswich hierarchy on his return from Africa, he refused to combine management with playing. \"I told them I would only concentrate on one job\", Ramsey later said; \"it would be impossible to play with the players I would be coaching.\" This settled, Ipswich announced Ramsey's appointment as manager on 9 August 1955.  Some of those who knew Ramsey had strong opinions about how he would manage. Wilf Grant, a former Southampton teammate of Ramsey's who was now on the training staff at Ipswich, commented: \"He'll be good, but he will be the boss.\" Billy Wright, Ramsey's England teammate commented, \"In appointing Alf to become their manager Ipswich Town paid a tremendous tribute to intelligent football\u2014and footballers who think!\""]}, {"page": "Duncan Edwards", "response": ["In May 1955, Edwards was selected for the England squad which travelled to mainland Europe for matches against France, Portugal and Spain, starting all three matches. Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the British Army with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Army service was compulsory at the time for all men of his age under the National Service scheme.McCartney, p. 59. He was stationed at Nesscliffe near Shrewsbury along with teammate Bobby Charlton, but was allowed leave to play for United. He also took part in army matches, and in one season played nearly 100 matches in total.Meek, p. 102. In the 1955\u201356 season, despite missing nearly two months of action due to a severe bout of influenza,McCartney, pp. 60\u201361. Edwards played 33 times as United won the championship of the Football League by a margin of 11 points from Blackpool. The following season he made 34 league appearances, taking his total past the 100 mark, as United won a second consecutive league title, and was also in the team that contested the 1957 FA Cup Final, in which United missed out on the Double after a 2\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa. He also made seven appearances during United's first ever foray into the European Cup, including a 10\u20130 win over Anderlecht which remains the club's biggest-ever margin of victory. By now he was also a regular in the England team, featuring in all four of England's qualifying matches for the 1958 World Cup and scoring two goals in the 5\u20132 win over Denmark on 5 December 1956. He was expected to be a key player for England in the 1958 World Cup, and was seen as a likely candidate to replace the veteran Billy Wright as national team captain."]}]}}
