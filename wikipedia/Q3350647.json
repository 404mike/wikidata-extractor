He also pointed out that \"The scenario booklet may come as a disappointment to some,\" since two of the scenarios advertised on the outside of the box were actually held back and published in another supplement, Big Rubble: The Deadly City. However, Dickinson did call the scenarios that were included in this supplement \"an excellent introduction to Pavis.\" In particular, he was impressed by \"The Cradle\", saying, \"It makes a great and touching tale, full of imaginative description, for which Greg Stafford and all his helpers deserve thorough congratulation. I can see no obscurities or problems in it, but a word to the wise GM: keep this for the culmination of your Pavis campaign, for nothing will be the same after it.\" Dickinson concluded by giving this supplement an excellent rating of 9 out of 10."]}]}}
