He was therefore ready to co-operate with James in curtailing the powers of the Kirk which encroached on the royal authority, and in assimilating the Church of Scotland to that of England. On 30 May 1605 he became a member of the Scottish Privy Council. In 1608 he worked closely with George Home, Earl of Dunbar in appointing suitable ministers to vacant parishes in the Borders as part of James' programme for bringing peace to the region.Anna Groundwater, The Middle Shires Divided: Tensions at the Heart of the Anglo-Scottish Union, in Sharon Adams & Julian Goodare (2014), Scotland in the Age of Two Revolutions, The Boydell Press, pp. 32\u201333 In 1610 he presided as moderator over the assembly in which the supremacy of presbytery was abolished.
