During his last years, however, his key accomplishments became well known and revered in the scientific community, aided in particular by his friends Josiah Latimer Clark and Edward Sabine and his brother-in-law Samuel Carter.  He was knighted at the age of 82.  Colleagues at the Society of Telegraph Engineers regarded him as \"the father of electric telegraphy\", while his continuously recording camera was noted to be \"of extreme importance to meteorologists and physicists, and\u2026 employed in all first-rate observatories\". His portrait was painted by Hugh Carter. Commemorative plaques have been installed on two of his former homes and a road was named after him in Highbury.

In 1949, Carter started a third business growing fish bait. Originally limited to crickets, he later expanded into worms. By the mid-1950s, Carter was selling worms nationwide and laying claim to the title of \"the world's largest worm farmer\", producing more than 60 million a year. Carter wrote six pamphlets on worm and cricket farming, the best seller in 1958 was 18 Secrets of Successful Worm Raising  The pamphlet originally sold for $1.00. When Carter raised the price to $2.95 sales grew even faster. In 1978, he wrote a book: Cousin Beedie and Cousin Hot: My life with the Carter Family from Plains, Georgia. The book drew the wrath of aunt Lillian Carter and cousin Billy Carter. In the book, he had referred to the President's mother as \"domineering\", while offering his opinion of Presidential brother, Billy: \"He's not a redneck, but can make money as a redneck\". Shortly after the book's publication, Carter drew a political opponent. Peanut farmer Malcolm \"Chicken\" Wishard, was backed by Hugh Carter's aggrieved aunt Lillian and cousin Billy. However, Wishard's campaign slogan \"Help the Chicken take the Worm\", failed to inspire voters, and Carter was re-elected to another term in the State Senate.", "Carter retired from the State Senate in 1981. His bait growing business suffered declining sales in the 1990s, and he closed it in 1996.
