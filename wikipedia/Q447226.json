She competed primarily in freestyle and butterfly events.\nHalsall was the youngest member of the Team England swim squad at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, where she won silver medals in the 4\u00d7100-metre freestyle and 4\u00d7100-metre medley relays.\nShe was a member of the European Aquatics Championships 4\u00d7100-metre medley relay team that took gold in August 2006 and successfully defended their title in August 2008 in Eindhoven. Halsall won five medals at the 2010 European Championships in Budapest, 2 Golds, 2 Silvers and a Bronze and was a member of the 4x100-metre medley relay team that successfully defended their title for a second time. In winning five medals, she became the most successful British swimmer ever at a single championships.\nAt the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, India, Halsall won a gold medal, with a national record of 26.19 seconds, in the 50-metre butterfly, beating the favoured Australians. In the 100-metre freestyle Halsall was expected to win easily but a bout of illness (Delhi Belly) left her pale and weak and she had to be content with the bronze medal. Just 20 minutes later and despite being almost unable to stand up she returned for the 100-metre butterfly semi finals but failed to make the final.  Later in the Games Halsall recovered enough to win 3 more silver medals in the women's 50-metre freestyle and as part of the 4x100-metre freestyle and 4x100-metre medley relay teams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southport", "response": ["* Fran Halsall, swimmer"]}, {"page": "LEN European Aquatics Championships", "response": ["|align=left|Fran Halsall ||align=left| ||10||3||4||17"]}, {"page": "Aquatics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Melanie Marshall (1:01.64)Kate Haywood (1:08.54)Terri Dunning (59.40)Fran Halsall (55.03)"]}, {"page": "Loughborough College", "response": ["* Fran Halsall \u2013 swimming"]}, {"page": "Jon Wilkin", "response": ["In 2018, Wilkin married British Olympian Fran Halsall"]}, {"page": "World record progression 50 metres freestyle", "response": ["*Fran Halsall also swam 24.11 (2009), 24.13 (2012, 2016), 24.14 (2014), 24.21 (2016), 24.23 (2016), 24.26 (2016).", "*Fran Halsall also swam 23.73 (2011)."]}, {"page": "List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming (men)", "response": ["|Chris Walker-HebbornAdam PeatySiobhan-Marie O'ConnorFran HalsallRoss Murdoch*Rachael Kelly*"]}, {"page": "List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming (women)", "response": ["|Chris Walker-HebbornAdam PeatySiobhan-Marie O'ConnorFran HalsallRoss Murdoch*Rachael Kelly*"]}, {"page": "World record progression 100 metres freestyle", "response": ["*Fran Halsall also swam 53.02 (2009).", "*Fran Halsall also swam 51.61 (2009)."]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 100 metre freestyle", "response": ["| 7 || 17 (6) ||align=left| Fran Halsall ||align=left|  || 26.29 || 00:54.80 || Q"]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Games records in swimming", "response": ["File:Fran_Halsall_medal.jpg|Fran Halsall"]}, {"page": "World record progression 50 metres butterfly", "response": ["*Fran Halsall also swam 25.35 (2016), 25.36 (2014), 25.39 (2014), 25.48 (2016), 25.60 (2016)."]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay", "response": ["|align=left| Fran Halsall (53.02) CR, NRCaitlin McClatchey (54.98)Katherine Wyld (54.80)Amy Smith (54.22)", "|align=left| Fran Halsall (53.31)Caitlin McClatchey (54.43)Katherine Wyld (54.74)Amy Smith (54.51)"]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay", "response": ["|align=left| Gemma Spofforth (58.96)  Lowri Tynan (1:07.80) Ellen Gandy (57.39) Fran Halsall (52.88)  "]}, {"page": "2014 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)", "response": ["| Great Britain\u00a0Chris Walker-Hebborn (23.42)\u00a0Adam Peaty (25.89)\u00a0Siobhan-Marie O'Connor (25.10)\u00a0Fran Halsall (23.05)|| 1:37.46 ER"]}, {"page": "2014 European Aquatics Championships", "response": ["The 2014 European Aquatics Championships took place from 13 to 24 August 2014 in Berlin, Germany.
