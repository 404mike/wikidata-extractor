He thought the episode had a few logic gaps but that the emotional focus was enough to distract the audience from this. He felt that the sequence where Gwen's husband Rhys \"tears a strip off Gwen, then reminds her what Torchwood is fighting for\" was the episode's highlight. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy stated that the script \"neatly brings out the conflicting components within Gwen's character\" and praised the episode for raising the moral dilemma of whether to reveal the truth or not. He gave the episode four stars, feeling it to highlight the versatility of Torchwood as a series and to show \"how badly science-fiction is overlooked as serious, well-crafted drama\". IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 9.5 out of ten (\"Amazing\") and stated it to be \"the kind of science fiction that every series should aspire to create.\" He felt that the episode worked for viewers unfamiliar with the show whilst managing to progress \"every regular character in the series\". He felt that the episode handled the subject matter of missing people thoughtfully and sensitively whilst furthering the relationship between Rhys and Gwen, stating that it was the \"best episode Gwen has had to date\" which showcased \"Eve Myles range\" and Kai Owen's \"tremendous power as an actor.\" Fickett concluded his review by stating that \"this is very nearly a perfect episode of not just Torchwood, but the genre of science fiction and the medium of television\"."]}, {"page": "Torchwood: Children of Earth", "response": ["Torchwood was shown on the network's premiere channel, BBC One, every weeknight for one week in July 2009. Despite the move to BBC One, the show was cut from a standard thirteen-episode run to just five, something that lead actor John Barrowman felt was almost like a \"punishment\" from the BBC. Production on the mini-series began in August 2008, and Barrowman along with actors Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd (his final appearance in the show), and Kai Owen (now given co-star billing) all returned. The serial significantly features new actors to the series over the course of its five episodes, most prominently Peter Capaldi. Davies had to substantially rewrite parts of the serial to accommodate the unavailability of actors Freema Agyeman and Noel Clarke, whose presence in the serial had been set up in the 2008 Doctor Who finale.", "John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Gareth David Lloyd, Kai Owen and Tom Price all reprise their respective Torchwood roles for the serial. David-Lloyd had first concluded that Ianto was being killed off when his agent told him he was only needed for four out of five episodes."]}, {"page": "Andy Davidson (Torchwood)", "response": ["Andy Davidson is a fictional character in the BBC television programme Torchwood, portrayed by Tom Price. Andy, an officer with the South Wales Police, is a supporting character who first appears in Torchwoods premiere episode \"Everything Changes\" and recurs regularly from thereon. Though initially only credited as 'PC Andy', the character's surname 'Davidson' was given in novels and online media and eventually confirmed by dialogue in Children of Earth, \"Day Three\" (2009). Like Gwen's partner, Rhys (Kai Owen), Andy is used by the production team as an everyman character who grounds the series in a recognisable real-world setting. The character had originally been slated to be killed off in the first series, though the production team had a change of heart, believing him to work well as a supporting character. Both cast and crew, as well as professional reviewers have spoken of the character's role in providing comic relief and an outsider's perspective on the Torchwood Institute.", "Andy first appears in the series premi\u00e8re \"Everything Changes\" (2006) and is present when his police partner Gwen Cooper sustains a head injury, causing him to remain sceptical when she begins tracking Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Torchwood. After Gwen joins Torchwood, she meets Davidson again outside a nightclub where a man has been killed by a \"sex monster\"-possessed woman. Like Gwen's boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen), Andy initially believes that she has been promoted to \"special ops\". He later appears to begrudgingly assist Gwen in series one finale \"End of Days\" (2007), and the second series opener \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\" (2008). In \"Adrift\", Davidson calls Gwen to investigate sudden disappearances in Cardiff, and admonishes her for her hardened perspective. During the episode he reveals his affection for her and resentment toward Rhys, which Gwen learns is his excuse for not attending her wedding. During \"Exit Wounds\", Andy helps Gwen in coordinating the police force's response to the bombs planted by Gray (Lachlan Nieober) and Captain John Hart (James Marsters), subsequently working alongside Rhys to keep the attacking alien Weevils out of the police station."]}, {"page": "List of Hollyoaks characters (2007)", "response": ["When Cleo's sexually abusive stepfather Pete Buchanan (Kai Owen) arrives back Harry is unaware that he is grooming Cleo.
