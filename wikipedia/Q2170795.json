The first B.2 was anticipated to be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order.Wynn 1997, pp. 315, 316. As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, operational flexibility was believed to be extended by the provision of in-flight refueling] equipment and tanker aircraft.Wynn 1997, p. 154. The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment, and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro Blue Steel stand-off missile, then in development.Wynn 1997, p. 314. To develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase-2C wing, improved flying control surfaces, and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957.Laming 2002, p. 82. Plans were in hand to equip all Vulcans from the 16th aircraft onwards with in-flight refueling receiving equipment.Wynn 1997, p. 155. A B.1, XA903, was allocated for Blue Steel development work. Other B.1s were used for the development of the BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; and ECM including jammers within a bulged tail cone and a tail warning radar, XA895.Laming 2002, pp. 218, 219."]}, {"page": "British Aircraft Corporation", "response": ["* Roy Ewans"]}, {"page": "Stuart Davies (engineer)", "response": ["In 1947 he became the technical director at Avro, with responsibility for producing the Avro Vulcan (Avro 698), which first flew on 30 August 1952.
