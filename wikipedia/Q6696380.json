The appeal stretches beyond style. The lean scripting (even at four hours the program can't cover every one of Bront\u00eb's plot details), the expeditious pacing and the interaction among the actors are first-class, if not as brilliant as the more ambitious and magnificent Bleak House from last season.\"USA Today review"]}, {"page": "Gilbert Imlay", "response": ["In 1793, during the French Revolution, Imlay became a diplomatic representative of the United States to France, while at the same time pursuing his own business interests by running the British blockade of French ports. Imlay's excursion into diplomacy led to his meeting Mary Wollstonecraft; to shield herself from the dangers of the French Revolution, she registered at the American Embassy as Imlay's wife, though they never actually married. Imlay and Wollstonecraft shared a home in Paris, though business interests took him for extended periods of time to Le Havre, much to the dismay of his \"wife.\" Imlay eventually returned to London, leaving Wollstonecraft and her daughter alone in Paris. In time she rejoined him in England, carried her infant daughter to Scandinavia in search of a ship load of French silver on Imlay's behalf, and returned to London, only to discover that Imlay was living with an actress. That effectively ended their relationship. Despite his promises, Imlay showed no interest in his child's welfare, and left her to the care of Wollstonecraft's husband William Godwin after her mother's death three years later.Lucasta Miller, \"Rogue Trader\", Times Literary Supplement April 25, 2008 p 24."]}, {"page": "Mich\u00e8le Roberts", "response": ["* \"Take risks\", The Guardian, 14 July 2007 \u2013 interview-based feature by Lucasta Miller"]}, {"page": "Lucasta miller", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lucasta Miller "]}, {"page": "Metabiography", "response": ["In the field of biographies of artists and writers, the metabiographical approach was followed e.g. by David Dennis for Ludwig van Beethoven (1770\u20131827),Dennis, David B., 1996.
