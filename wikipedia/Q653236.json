However his polite, easy-going manner was initially well received by both his supporters and his critics. Major's appearance was noted for its greyness, his prodigious philtrum, and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in Spitting Image, Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a literally grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying \"nice peas, dear\", while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague Virginia Bottomley \u2013 an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with Edwina Currie, which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring \"oh dear\". Long-standing Conservative MP Enoch Powell, when asked about Major, stated \"I simply find myself asking \u2013 does he really exist?\", whereas on the left Labour's Alastair Campbell dismissed him as a \"piece of lettuce that passes for prime minister\" and Labour MP Tony Banks said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council. Every time he gets up now I keep thinking, 'What on earth is Councillor Major doing?' I can't believe he's here and sometimes I think he can't either.\"", "The media (particularly The Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell) used the allegation by Alastair Campbell that he had observed Major tucking his shirt into his underpants to caricature him wearing his pants outside his trousers, as a pale grey echo of both Superman and Supermac, a parody of Harold Macmillan. Bell also used the humorous possibilities of the Cones Hotline, a means for the public to inform the authorities of potentially unnecessary traffic cones, which was part of the Citizen's Charter project established by John Major. Major was also satirised by Patrick Wright with his book 101 Uses for a John Major (based on a comic book of some 10 years earlier called 101 Uses for a Dead Cat), in which Major was illustrated serving a number of bizarre purposes, such as a train-spotter's anorak or as a flag-pole; Wright published a second collection of '101 Uses', as well as a parodic cartoon biography of Major entitled Not Inconsiderable: Being the Life and Times of John Major."]}, {"page": "May 25", "response": ["*1957 \u2013 Alastair Campbell, English journalist and author"]}, {"page": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["Immediately after her death, many sites around the world became briefly ad hoc memorials to Diana where the public left flowers and other tributes.
