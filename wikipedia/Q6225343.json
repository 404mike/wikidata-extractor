He was the great-grandson of Canon T. T. Carter.\nAfter attending Eton College, he studied classics at King's College, Cambridge, where he gained a double first. His 1934 expos\u00e9, An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets, co-written with Graham Pollard, exposed the forgeries of books and pamphlets by Harry Buxton Forman, an editor of Keats and Shelley, and Thomas J. Wise, one of the world's most prominent book collectors. Forman and Wise's crimes are generally regarded as one of the most notorious literary scandals of the twentieth century. Carter also wrote seminal books on aspects of book-collecting, and served on the board of directors of the influential journal The Book Collector, published by Queen Anne Press, a company managed by James Bond creator Ian Fleming. Carter also edited the prose of the poet A. E. Housman. He was the husband of the writer and curator Ernestine Carter and the brother of the printer Will Carter (1912\u20132001) of the Rampant Lions Press, at which some of his smaller-scale works were published. He was also a humorist and writer of clerihews, some of which were printed by Will Carter in 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bibliography", "response": ["Bibliography (from  and ), as a discipline, is traditionally the academic study of books as physical, cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as bibliology (from ).

She was uncooperative, wishing to hinder  publication of the biography and claiming that Medwin had attempted to bribe her with the sum of \u00a3250. The work took two years to finish, appearing in September 1847. It was not a coolly dispassionate account of Shelley's life. It is passionate and opinionated, and includes attacks on Medwin's personal enemies. There are numerous errors of date, fact and quotation, some of the later outright bowdlerised. (Most of the errors were removed by Harry Buxton Forman in 1913.)Harry Buxton Forman was exposed as a forger of antique books in 1934 by John Carter and Graham Pollard in An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets.Collins, John, Two Forgers: A Biography of Harry Buxton Forman and Thomas James Wise, Oak Knoll Press, New Castle, Del., 1992.  Whatever its faults, it remains a major source for the poet's early life and work. Medwin is the main source on the childhood of Shelley, a major source for the events of 1821\u20131822, and a mine of personal recollections. It was also the major source of knowledge in Germany of the life and work of Shelley, who since his death had become something of a divisive figure, and criticism was to be expected. Medwin's biography duly received a withering attack in The Athenaeum, which opened its review: \"We are not in any way satisfied with this book.\"Athenaeum, 18 September 1847 \"The Spectator\" wrote \"Medwin's labours... are chiefly remarkable for the art of stuffing... nor does the author forget a scandal when he can pick any up.\" Medwin was even more strongly reviled by the surviving members of the Pisan circle. Mary Shelley's reaction was to be expected, given her antipathy towards him, but Trelawny was equally cutting, calling the work \"superficial\" as late as 1870.Letters of Edward John Trelawny, quoting a letter from Trelawny to W. M. Rossetti dated 1870. However, it was received better by some critics, including William Howitt and W. Harrison Ainsworth, who began their review in Howitt's Journal by saying the subject \"could not possibly have fallen into more competent hands.\"Howitt's Journal II (1847)"]}, {"page": "Harry Buxton Forman", "response": ["In 1887 an association with a London commodity broker and book collector Thomas James Wise saw the first of many illegal printings by Wise and Buxton Forman. The origins began in November 1886 when Edward Dowden published a biography of Shelley. It printed a considerable number of poems for the first time that Forman and Wise decided to print separately as Poems and Sonnets inventing the Philadelphia Historical Society as a cover. It was the start of a full scale conspiracy with numerous forgeries over the next fifteen years that were printed in London with templates that stated otherwise. They specialised in early pamphlets, supposedly privately published, of poets some of whom such as Rossetti and Swinburne were still living. Many of the forgeries were printed by the firm of Richard Clay & Sons who had printed legitimate facsimile issues of works by Robert Browning and Percy Shelley.  These were \"creative forgeries\" in that they were not copies of works that existed but were presented as works that could or should have existed.  Dates, places of publication, publishers (as distinct from printers) led the collecting world to believe in the 'rare private' editions. Buxton Forman and Wise forged publications by: Elizabeth Barrett Browning, George Eliot, John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, Alfred Tennyson, George Meredith and William Thackeray and many others. Many of these forgeries were sold by Buxton Forman [though there is little published evidence of sales] and Wise to collectors across the English speaking world and it would be forty years later that their fraud would be discovered by John Carter. The extent of the forgeries was such that the Brayton Ives sale in New York in 1915 contained twenty-four forgeries, for example.", "The exposure of Harry Buxton Forman as a forger in 1934 was driven by two booksellers, Graham Pollard and John Carter. They became suspicious of Browning's \"Reading Sonnets,\" and began to gather more and more evidence that the pamphlet was not as it purported to be. Chemical analysis of the paper showed that it contained a chemically constituted wood pulp, a process that was not used in England before 1874. In addition, the typeface in minor respects indicated a late 19th Century use, and via some sterling detective work Carter and Pollard traced the printing to Richard Clay and Sons. In turn this led to further investigation into various publications being offered for sale by Herbert Gorfin, a prominent bookseller. When it became apparent that Gorfin knew nothing of the forgeries, Pollard and Carter persuaded him to expose the source of the publications. Thus Thomas Wise and Harry Buxton Forman were outed as literary forgers. Pollard and Carter published their findings in 1934 in An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets.

In their writing and expose, Carter and Pollard were astute in their use of irony.  Carter and Pollard proved that a large number of rare first edition pamphlets from 19th century authors which depended solely on Wise's published works for their authenticity were fakes. Wise and a fellow bibliophile Harry Buxton Forman had been involved in the fabrication and sale of many of the same pamphlets to collectors.
