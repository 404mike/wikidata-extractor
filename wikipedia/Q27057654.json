In September 2016, Cardinals Raymond Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandm\u00fcller, and Joachim Meisner wrote a letter to Francis, requesting that he clarify five statements from Amoris laetitia. After the letter was ignored, the cardinals publicized their letter, popularly known as the dubia. The following year, in August 2017, a filial correction was issued by 62 critics of Pope Francis including Bishop Ren\u00e9 Henry Gracida of Corpus Christi, Bishop Bernard Fellay of the Society of Saint Pius X, and Joseph Shaw, the chairman of the Latin Mass Society."]}, {"page": "Thomas Shaw, 3rd Baron Craigmyle", "response": ["Their second son The Hon Thomas Columba Shaw is the current (4th) Baron Craigmyle.

The document states that certain passages from Amoris laetitia and other \"words, deeds, and omissions\" of Pope Francis \"are serving to propagate heresies\". The document had 62 signatories when it was made public in September after the group received no reply. The most prominent signatories were Bishop Bernard Fellay, the superior general of the Society of Saint Pius X, which has been at odds with the Holy See for decades; Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, former president of the Vatican bank; and Joseph Shaw, tutorial fellow in philosophy at Oxford University. Dr. Jacob Wood, assistant professor of theology at Franciscan University of Steubenville, said that Amoris laetitia does not explicitly state any of the heresies alleged by the signatories.  Rather, \"The signatories claim that the pope has failed to stop the spread of heresy, rather than that he has committed the sin of heresy himself.\" Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Vatican Secretary of State, indirectly addressed the controversy, advocating for those who disagree with the Pope to dialogue with the church and \"find ways to understand one another.\""]}, {"page": "Correctio filialis de haeresibus propagatis", "response": ["*Joseph Shaw \u2013 Tutor in Moral philosophy, St Benet's Hall, University of Oxford"]}, {"page": "Traditionis custodes", "response": ["Joseph Shaw, the chairman of the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales, said that the motu proprio appeared to \"undo entirely the legal provisions made for the Traditional Mass by Pope Benedict, and to take us back not only to the situation before the 2007 apostolic letter Summorum Pontificum, but even before 1988, when Pope John Paul II -- who was canonized by Pope Francis -- described the more ancient Mass as a 'rightful aspiration' of the faithful.\" He also stated that Traditionis custodes was a \"staggering document, exceeding our worst expectations. Pope Francis has completely undone the arrangements of Summorum Pontificum and crested a situation which seems entirely unworkable, banning the Extraordinary Form from parish churches.\" He also published a blog post on the subject on the Society's website.
