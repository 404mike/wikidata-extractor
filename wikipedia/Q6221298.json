Onstage and on record he almost entirely restricts himself to keyboards and vocals (although he has been known to play live rhythm guitar on performances of It Bites' 'Still Too Young to Remember').\nBorn and brought up in Whitehaven, Cumbria, Beck spent his early teen years as a country-and-western accordionist on the Cumbrian club circuit before becoming a founder member of It Bites alongside guitarist and lead vocalist Francis Dunnery, bass guitarist Dick Nolan and drummer Bob Dalton. Beck was also a member of Navajo Kiss and Sister Sarah, the two short-lived groups formed by the remaining It Bites members following the 1990 departure of Dunnery (and for which Beck switched entirely from keyboards to guitar). Beck rejoined It Bites for the band's reformation in 2006. Along with Dalton, Beck is one of the two remaining original members of the group as well as being one of its main composers.\nBeck has also been a member of Unicorn Jones (a post-It Bites trio of himself, Dick Nolan and singer David Banks which released the album A Hundred Thousand Million Stars in 1996) and of British prog-rock supergroup Kino (featuring Marillion bassist Pete Trewavas, former Porcupine Tree drummer Chris Maitland (later replaced by Bob Dalton) and guitarist/singer John Mitchell (from Arena, and subsequently Francis Dunnery's replacement in It Bites), who released the Picture album in 2005.\nAs a session or touring musician, Beck has played with John Wetton and Fish and is a longstanding contributor to the live line-up of the Alan Parsons Project.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Entwistle", "response": ["In 2001, he played in Alan Parsons' Beatles tribute show A Walk Down Abbey Road. The show also featured Ann Wilson of Heart, Todd Rundgren, David Pack of Ambrosia, Godfrey Townsend, Steve Luongo, and John Beck. That year he also played with the Who at the Concert for New York City. He also joined forces again with the John Entwistle Band for an 8-gig tour. This time Chris Clark played keyboards. From January\u2013February 2002, Entwistle played his last concerts with the Who in a handful of dates in England, the last being on 8 February at London's Royal Albert Hall.

Keyboard player John Beck from Whitehaven joined the group later in 1982, and for a short period of time It Bites also featured saxophonist Howard \"H\" Smith, a period in which the band worked playing gigs at nightclubs around Cumbria.", "It Bites showcased some new post-Eat Me in St. Louis material on an eight-date UK tour during March and April 1990. In June 1990, the band travelled to Los Angeles, to start writing and recording their fourth album. This was intended to be the record to break the American market, and Dunnery promised simpler songs with \"a stronger taste of blues.\" However, tensions within the band reached breaking point during the pre-rehearsal period, and it was confirmed to the band's fanclub in November 1990 that the band had parted company with Francis Dunnery. Dunnery is rumoured to have demanded full band leadership and control over material, and it's also claimed that he clashed with former creative foil John Beck to the extent that he demanded Beck's expulsion from the band.", "Now minus Dunnery, the remaining trio initially stayed on in Los Angeles, continuing to write and auditioning new singers. Returning to England, they recruited Lee Knott as the new It Bites singer. Knott had previously fronted the band Innocence Lost, who had played support slots to It Bites on previous UK dates. During this period, John Beck had also switched instruments, later recalling that \"at the time I think we were all sick of what was happening and wanted a total change. I was playing guitar, and a little bit of keyboards, but mainly guitar. It was a change for me, and Bob & Dick were happy doing that.\"", "In an attempt to refresh their identity, the Knott-fronted It Bites renamed themselves as Navajo Kiss and played several gigs under that name. The concerts featured new material plus a vigorous cover of \"Murder of the Planet Earth\" (from Eat Me in St. Louis). A second name-change \u2013 to Sister Sarah \u2013 followed, but the band split quietly within the year due to lack of enthusiasm from audiences. John Beck would later admit \"we found out pretty soon that people weren\u2019t about to go along with such a change in direction.\" The various band members went their separate ways but remained in touch.", "A partial It Bites reunion appeared in 1996 in the shape of the band Unicorn Jones. This project featured John Beck, Dick Nolan and singer David Banks (who'd once auditioned for It Bites and who'd previously been part of the band Mummy Calls, whose song \"Beauty Has Her Way\" appeared on the soundtrack to the film \"The Lost Boys\"). Banks had approached Beck and Nolan to help him record an album of Burt Bacharach covers, but the trio had been sidetracked into recording a bizarre cover of Mot\u00f6rhead's \"Ace of Spades\" (in which they described themselves as having \"replac(ed) Lemmy's timeless vocal with David's crooner voice and transform(ed) the heavy metal trash into a dark deranged groove\"). This cover version spawned the Unicorn Jones band, which recorded one album \u2013 1996's 'A Hundred Thousand Million Stars' \u2013 but did not play live.", "On 30 August 2003, during a solo concert at the Union Chapel in London, Francis Dunnery was joined onstage by his old It Bites band-mates for the first time since 1990. John Beck joined Dunnery for a duet on the It Bites song \"Hunting The Whale\", following which Dick Nolan and Bob Dalton also joined in for a gig finale of \"Still Too Young To Remember\". Following this, it was announced that It Bites would be getting back together to write and record a new album followed by a tour.", "In 2006, It Bites opted to formally reunite, but with Beck and Dalton's Kino bandmate John Mitchell replacing Dunnery as lead singer and guitarist. According to an interview on francisdunnery.com, dated 15 October 2008, Dunnery said Bob Dalton called him out of the blue and said he was no longer wanted in the band. Dalton explained to Dunnery that they already had someone to replace him. Mitchell had been an enthusiastic It Bites fan since his teens, and was happy to take on the role. John Beck commented \"I\u2019ve met guitarists that could manage Frank\u2019s licks but weren\u2019t singers, or the other way around. John\u2019s the first to do both. It\u2019s all been so natural, I don\u2019t even remember agreeing to do this; it took on a life of its own.\"", "On 23 June 2008 the band announced a further change to their line-up with the departure of another founder member, bass player Dick Nolan. Earlier in the year, Nolan had failed to show up for a performance at a Classic Rock Society concert, and there had been rumours of his dissatisfaction with the project. The band's statement revealed that all bass playing on the forthcoming album had in fact been performed by either John Mitchell or John Beck \u2013 in what the band referred to as \"Genesis-style\", a reference to the 1978 Genesis album ...And Then There Were Three... \u2013 and that It Bites had reluctantly parted company with Nolan due to his lack of involvement and commitment. Nolan would continue working with Ray Davies (and would eventually resurface in 2020 as part of the Subdeluxe band fronted by Scottish singer/songwriter Scott Donaldson). ", "On 25 May 2019, Bob Dalton announced the apparent end of the band on Facebook, stating \"unfortunately It Bites won't be touring or gigging again, we don't have any plans for anything else in the future but it was a great time and we do appreciate all of you who have followed us through the years.\" However, a few days after Dalton's announcement John Mitchell revealed that neither he nor John Beck had been consulted about dissolving It Bites, and that even if the band had split up he might still continue working with Beck. He clarified \"neither of us were consulted with or informed of the announcement \u2013 we have been looking into the possibility of releasing The Tall Ships on vinyl, and had made arrangements to write together in the coming weeks (we already have the bones of four songs written and recorded). If Bob doesn't wish to be part of this endeavour, that is entirely down to him but we would have appreciated a combined discussion and agreement before making such an announcement.
