Cook wrote that Barr chose \u03d5 by analogy to the use of  for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and because it is the first Greek letter in the name of the ancient sculptor Phidias. Although Martin Gardner later wrote that Phidias was chosen because he was \"believed to have used the golden proportion frequently in his sculpture\", Barr himself denied this, writing in his paper \"Parameters of beauty\" that he doubted Phidias used the golden ratio. Schooling communicated some of his discoveries with Barr to Cook after seeing an article by Cook about phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, which often approximates the golden ratio."]}, {"page": "Art competitions at the 1920 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| 2 || align=\"left\"| Theodore Andrea Cook || align=\"left\"| "]}, {"page": "Andrea Theodore Cook", "response": ["#REDIRECT Theodore Andrea Cook"]}, {"page": "Theodore Cook", "response": ["*Theodore Andrea Cook (1867\u20131928), British art critic and writer"]}, {"page": "Romford Garden Suburb", "response": ["*Theodore Andrea Cook"]}, {"page": "Bracy Clark", "response": ["Clark made a continental tour around 1797, but wartime conditions meant he wasn't able to visit France.
