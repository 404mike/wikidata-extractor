However, in August 1930 the Marksmen toured Central Europe, playing six games in Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary. The squad included, among others, Bill Harper, Alex McNab, Jerry Best and Werner Nilsen as well as veterans James White, Charlie McGill and Bill McPherson and guest player Archie Stark. Both Billy Gonsalves and Bert Patenaude were playing with the United States at the 1930 FIFA World Cup and did not travel. They opened the tour on August 20 with a 2\u20132 tie against  Slavia Prague in front of  a crowd of 18,000. This was the first of two games against Slavia. They lost the other 4\u20130 on August 28. They also played  FK Austria Wien twice, losing the first game 6\u20130 on August 23 before winning the second 3\u20131 the following day.  On August 30 they won their second game when they put three goals past \u0160K Slovan Bratislava. The tour came to an end on August 31 when they lost 6\u20132 to Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC.  The tour ended early, and in dispute, with Fall River unhappy about their share of the gate receipts."]}, {"page": "Dan Lewis (footballer)", "response": ["After Herbert Chapman arrived as Arsenal manager in 1925, Lewis shared goalkeeping duties with Jock Robson and Bill Harper, but Lewis gradually became the club's No. 1, particularly after Robson and Harper left in 1926 and 1927 respectively. He won his first cap for Wales in a 3\u20133 draw against England on 12 February 1927. In all he won three caps, the last of which was a 6\u20130 defeat by England at Stamford Bridge on 20 November 1929.", "Lewis continued to play as Arsenal's regular goalkeeper for the next three seasons. However, when they reached Wembley for their second Cup final in 1930, Lewis was injured and had major surgery on a knee. He never fully recovered from this which effectively finished his football career. Arsenal beat Huddersfield 2\u20130 to claim their first major trophy. Lewis hardly featured at all the following season, particularly after the signings of Bill Harper (for a second spell) and Gerard Keizer. He was transferred to Gillingham in May 1931. In all he played 169 matches for Arsenal."]}, {"page": "Gerrit Keizer", "response": ["Keizer's playing style was distinctly flamboyant, to the point of at times erratic. With stiff competition coming from Arsenal's other keepers, Bill Harper and Charlie Preedy, Keizer lost his regular spot within the side. He thus left Arsenal in July 1931 for Charlton Athletic. Keizer later played for club Queens Park Rangers."]}, {"page": "Jock Robson", "response": ["Robson started the 1925\u201326 season as first-choice but after new Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman signed Bill Harper in November 1925, Robson's days at Arsenal were numbered. He made his last first-team appearance in a 5\u20132 win against Manchester City on 7 November 1925. After spending the rest of the season in the reserves, Robson left Arsenal in August 1926 for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. In all, he played 101 matches for Arsenal."]}, {"page": "Charlie Preedy", "response": ["Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman was never happy with any of his goalkeepers and in an attempt to fill the role signed both Gerard Keizer and Bill Harper in the 1930 close season, and then Frank Moss a year later. Despite intense competition for the goalkeeper's place, Preedy made 25 appearances in the 1930-31 and 1931-32 seasons, but not enough to win a League Championship medal in the former. After an entire season spent as Moss's understudy, Preedy left Arsenal for Bristol Rovers in 1933, having played 40 matches for the Gunners. After a season with Rovers he moved to Luton Town and finished his career with non-league Margate in 1935. He then followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Jack, and became a London taxi driver. He died in 1978."]}, {"page": "Hughie Ferguson", "response": ["He was also renowned for his modesty and sense of fair play. John Hunter, who managed Ferguson at Motherwell, described him as \"irreproachable in conduct, a fine upright fellow, he was above all else a gentleman.\" One such example of this came in a league match against Hibernian while playing for Motherwell. Opposition goalkeeper Bill Harper had sustained an injury and the opportunity came to Ferguson to take advantage of this when he struggled to gather the ball from a cross. Rather than capitalise on Harper's misfortune, Ferguson allowed the keeper to recover and stop a certain goal."]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|GK |||| Bill Harper"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|GK |||| Bill Harper"]}, {"page": "List of Hibernian F.C. players", "response": ["*Bill Harper"]}, {"page": "John Moody (footballer)", "response": ["Moody was born in Heeley, Sheffield and first played in local football in the Sheffield Amateur League. He was signed by Herbert Chapman's Arsenal in August 1925 but was initially fourth-choice goalkeeper behind Jock Robson, Bill Harper and Dan Lewis. He didn't make his first team debut for nearly two years, it coming in a 3\u20132 defeat away to Bury on 4 May 1927. Moody went on to keep goal in the final match of 1926-27, a 4-0 North London derby win, and covered for Lewis the following season in four matches while the latter was injured; his final game was a 6\u20134 defeat at Sheffield United on 7 January 1928."]}]}}
