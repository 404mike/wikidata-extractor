C. Pigou was at the time the sole economics professor at Cambridge. He had a continuing interest in the subject of unemployment, having expressed the view in his popular Unemployment\u202f (1913) that it was caused by \"maladjustment between wage-rates and demand\"Cited by Kahn, op. cit., p. 193. \u2013 a view Keynes may have shared prior to the years of the General Theory. Nor were his practical recommendations very different: \"on many occasions in the thirties\" Pigou \"gave public support ... to State action designed to stimulate employment\".Kahn, op. cit., p. 193. Where the two men differed is in the link between theory and practice. Keynes was seeking to build theoretical foundations to support his recommendations for public works while Pigou showed no disposition to move away from classical doctrine. Referring to him and Dennis Robertson, Keynes asked rhetorically: \"Why do they insist on maintaining theories from which their own practical conclusions cannot possibly follow?\"Dimand, op. cit., p. 76.", "Economists generally think the rate of interest will not fall below a certain limit, often seen as zero or a slightly negative number. Keynes suggested that the limit might be appreciably greater than zero but did not attach much practical significance to it.

Robertson, \"Some Notes on Mr. Keynes' General Theory of Interest\", Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1936 but it was John Hicks in \"Mr. Keynes and the Classics\"\"Mr. Keynes and the 'Classics'; A Suggested Interpretation\", Econometrica, 1937. who recognised the significance of a slightly different concept."]}, {"page": "Milton Friedman", "response": ["Friedman spent the 1954\u20131955 academic year as a Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.

Keynes did not attend these seminars but was informed of their discussions by Kahn. Keynes was little influenced by the various heterodox economists of the 1930s,  his General theory was written largely in a Marshellian framework though with some important points of dissent such as the idea that excessive savings can be harmful for the overall economy.   Keynes asserts that when savings exceed available investment opportunities it makes it impossible for business as a whole to make a profit and so lay offs and increased unemployment will result. In chapter 23 of the General  Theory Keynes traces the genesis of this idea to, among others,  Mercantilist thinkers of the previous three centuries,  to the Fable of the Bees and to the dissenting economist J A Hobson with his Physiology of industry (1889).", "An alternative take was advocated at the dawning of the revolution by Dennis Robertson, who Fletcher has described as the most intellectually formidable of Keynes's contemporary critics. This view held that the great excitement triggered by the General Theory was unjustified \u2013 that genuinely new ideas presented were overstated and not supported by evidence, while the verifiable ideas were merely well-established principles dressed up in new ways. According to Hyman Minsky, this position eventually became dominant in mainstream academia, though it is by no means unchallenged."]}, {"page": "History of macroeconomic thought", "response": ["Other economists focused more on theory in their business cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business cycle theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately.
