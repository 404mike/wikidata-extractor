Crace wrote short stories from the early 1970s and published his first novel Continent in 1986. Still living in Moseley in the south of the city, his reputation unusually combines both a broad popular readership and substantial acclaim among critics and academics. His work sits outside the social realist mainstream of English novelists, having more in common with European and South American authors such as Italo Calvino, Vladimir Nabokov, Franz Kafka, W. G. Sebald, Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Although his novels have settings as diverse as the Bronze Age, the Judaean Desert in the time of Christ, an 1830s Cornish fishing village and an invented eighth continent, Crace claims that the subject of all of his books is present-day Birmingham, seen through \"some idea or inspiration that would allow me to take the subject and dislocate it to another place and time to see if it cracks, if it bends.\""]}, {"page": "Sex & Violence, Death & Silence", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gordon Burn"]}]}}
