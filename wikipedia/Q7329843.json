Contributor Richard Watson Dickson published a book about gardening in 1807 under the name of Alexander MacDonald. At about this time there seems to have been a genre established of books on practical topics for craftsmen, containing information taken from the various encyclop\u00e6dias being published then and written by journalists. One such was \"Thomas Martin\", The Circle of the Mechanical Arts.According to the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, vol 4. Martin was, in fact, John Farey, Jr. Another was \"John Nicholson\", The Operative Mechanic, 1825.According to Jeremy, David J. and Darnell, Polly C., Visual Mechanic Knowledge: The workshop drawings of Isaac Ebeneezer Markham (1795\u20131825), New England Textile Mechanic, Pub. Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, Vol 263 , 2010, p 338, this author is also likely to have been Farey. Both the writers were described as civil engineers, yet are quite unknown in the profession and published nothing more."]}, {"page": "General View of Agriculture county surveys", "response": ["|Richard Watson Dickson"]}]}}
