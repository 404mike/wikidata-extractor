The tenements are probably the oldest. At one time the Lord Provost of Glasgow David Hodge stayed in this street, as did John Logie Baird who took lodgings there. At the top of Hillend Road there is a golf course which is bordered by Ruchill on the opposite side. There are also numerous abandoned railway tunnels which would appear to link to the abandoned Botanic Gardens railway station. The Halloween Pen is a small tunnel which runs underneath the Forth and Clyde Canal and links Lambhill to Cadder. Bordering the south side of Hillend Rd are the garden allotments. Near to the allotments, on Balmore Road, is the ticket office of a station for an abandoned railway line."]}, {"page": "David Hodge", "response": ["David Hodge may refer to:", "*David Hodge (councillor), leader of Surrey County Council", "*David Hodge (Glasgow)  (1909\u20131991), Lord Provost of Glasgow", "*David Hodges (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "1980 New Year Honours", "response": ["*David Hodge, Lord Provost, City of Glasgow."]}]}}
