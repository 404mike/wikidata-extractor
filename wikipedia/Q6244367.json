The son of Liverpool merchants, he lived in Rock Ferry before moving to London in 1866. His works were shown at the Liverpool Academy from 1859\u20131867 and at the Royal Academy from 1863\u20131867. However, little else is known of his life, and only four paintings have been attributed to him with any certainty.Sweethearts and Wives, 1860, is considered Lee's masterpiece. It has been suggested that the rightmost sailor is a self-portrait of John Lee. The work is a typical dockside scene, which depicts sailors on the Liverpool docks going out to duty on HMS Majestic, which served as part of the harbour defences, and visible anchored in the middle of the Mersey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood", "response": ["* John Lee (painter)"]}, {"page": "John Lee", "response": ["John Lee may refer to:", "*John Lee (astronomer) (1783\u20131866), President of the Royal Astronomical Society", "*John Lee (university principal) (1779\u20131859), University of Edinburgh Principal", "*John Lee (pathologist) (born 1961), English", "*John Lee (academic) (born 1973), Australian", "*John Lee (British actor) (1725\u20131781), British actor", "*John Lee (Australian actor) (1928\u20132000), Australian television actor", "*John Lee (artist), British Pre-Raphaelite artist", "*John Lee (author) (born 1931), American thriller writer", "*John Lee (musician) (born 1952), American bassist, producer, recording engineer", "*John Lee (producer) (born 1972), co-creator of MTV2 comedy show Wonder Showzen", "*John Lee (California politician) (2019\u2013present), Los Angeles City Council for district 12", "*John Lee (Maryland politician) (1788\u20131871), Maryland representative in the 18th United States Congress", "*John Lee (1695\u20131761), British Member of Parliament for Newport and Malmesbury", "*John Lee (Attorney-General) (1733\u20131793), Attorney-General for England and Wales, 1783, British MP for Higham Ferrers and Clitheroe", "*John Lee Lee (1802\u20131874), British Member of Parliament for Wells", "*John Lee (Labour politician) (1927\u20132020), Labour Party Member of Parliament for Reading", "*John Lee, Baron Lee of Trafford (born 1942), former Minister and Conservative Member of Parliament for Pendle", "*John Lee (by 1491-1542 or later), MP for Cumberland", "*John Lee (by 1526-60 or later), MP for Cumberland in 1554", "*John Lee (died 1558), MP for Sandwich", "*John Lee (MP for New Woodstock) (c. 1535-c. 1603), MP for New Woodstock", "*John Lee (Australian politician) (1885\u20131957), New South Wales state politician", "*John Lee (Canadian politician) (1845\u20131915), politician in Ontario, Canada", "*John Lee (government official) (born 1957), Hong Kong police officer and politician", "*John Lee (bureaucrat) (born 1964), Australian bureaucrat", "*John Lee (cricketer) (1825\u20131903), English clergyman and cricketer", "*John Lee (footballer, born 1869) (1869\u2013?), English footballer", "*John Lee (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u2013?), English footballer", "*John Lee (defensive lineman) (born 1953), NFL player", "*John Lee (placekicker) (born 1964), UCLA football player", "*John Lee (rower) (born 1948), Australian Olympic rower", "*John Lee (hurler) (born 1986), plays for the Galway senior hurling team", "*John Lee (driver), in 1991 British Formula Three season and 1992 British Formula Three season", "*John Lee (ice dancer), partner of Naomi Lang at the 1995 U.S. Figure Skating Championships", "*John Lee (inventor), 19th century Scottish-Canadian inventor and arms designer", "*John Lee (trade unionist) (died 1963), British trade union leader"]}, {"page": "List of Pre-Raphaelite paintings", "response": ["===John Lee==="]}, {"page": "James Campbell (artist)", "response": ["*John Lee"]}, {"page": "William Davis (artist)", "response": ["*John Lee"]}, {"page": "William Lindsay Windus", "response": ["*John Lee"]}]}}
