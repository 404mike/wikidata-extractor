It is part Bildungsroman \u2014 depicting the coming of age of a writer \u2014 part a Ulysses for Oslo, whose snowy parks and shadowy churches are vividly rendered.\" Woodward also wrote: \"The pace slackens at times, particularly towards the end but, for the most part, the language has enough energy and inventiveness to carry us along.
