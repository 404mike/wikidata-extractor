He was educated at Rugby and New College, Oxford and after obtaining a degree in 1871 in  natural science he studied medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital, obtaining a Mead Medal, and graduated B.M. in 1876 but he never practiced medicine. He worked for fourteen years as the representative for Wandsworth in the London County Council. An interest in entomology was sparked at an early age, influenced by his uncle William Spence. An injury to his eye while studying at Oxford however put an end to his entomological studies but he took a keen interest on a trip through India and Sri Lanka in 1903-4 accompanied by his second wife, the geologist Mary Jane Longstaff. He collected some 14000 specimens which were donated to the Hope collection at Oxford and he wrote a book Butterfly Hunting in Many Lands (1912). He also took an interest in demographic statistics and published Studies in statistics, social, political, and medical (1891).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["| Dr. George Blundell Longstaff", "| Dr. George Blundell Longstaff"]}, {"page": "Longstaff", "response": ["*George Blundell Longstaff (1849\u20131921), British civil activist"]}, {"page": "Jane Longstaff", "response": ["In August 1906, she married widower George Blundell Longstaff, a prominent lepidopterist and statistician. They travelled on collecting expeditions overseas together, to northern and southern Africa, Australia, the British West Indies, and South America, George collecting butterflies and Jane Longstaff collecting molluscs. Based on her collections in the tropics, she published a number of papers and appendices to her husband's books, most notably one on the freshwater and land molluscs of the southern Sudan. She also took home some large land snails of the species Achatina zebra, and published a paper on their habits in captivity in 1921."]}, {"page": "Ichneutica chlorodonta", "response": ["I. chlorodonta was first described by George Hampson in 1911. The holotype specimen used by Hampson was collected in Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia by George Blundell Longstaff and is held by the Natural History Museum, London. In 1988 J. S. Dugdale, in his catalogue on New Zealand lepidopera, placed this species within the Graphania genus. In 2019 Robert Hoare undertook a major review of New Zealand Noctuidae species. During this review the genus Ichneutica was greatly expanded and the genus Graphania was subsumed into that genus as a synonym. As a result of this review, this species is now known as Ichneutica chlorodonta."]}, {"page": "Physetica longstaffi", "response": ["This species was first described in 1911 by George Howes and named Morrisonia longstaffii in honour of George Blundell Longstaff. The spelling of the species name was changed to Morrisonia longstaffi in 1912 by Longstaff and it is this spelling that has subsequently been used. In 2017 Robert Hoare undertook a review of New Zealand Noctuinae and placed this species in the genus Physetica. He also considered the spelling of the species name and preserved and treated longstaffi as the correct  spelling under ICZN Article 33.3.1 as \"it is in prevailing usage and is attributed to the publication of the original spelling\".

In 1924 Edward Meyrick, thinking he was describing a new species, named this moth Melanchra distracta. In 1928 George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species under the name Melanchra sequens. He also discussed Melanchra distracta, also thinking it a separate species. In 1988 J. S. Dugdale placed this species in the genus Graphania and at the same time synonymised Melanchra distracta into that name.  In 2017 Robert Hoare undertook a review of New Zealand Noctuinae and placed this species in the genus Physetica. While reviewing this species Hoare designated a lectotype specimen, held at the Natural History Museum, London. The Auckland War Memorial Museum hold a paralectotype specimen of this species."]}]}}
