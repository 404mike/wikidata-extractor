For Vale, two attacking players were added to the squad; Syd Peppitt arrived from Stoke City for \u00a34,000, and Roland Lewis was signed from Congleton Town.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Roland Lewis"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["There was only one public pre-season friendly on 13 August, which saw the club's first team take on the reserves; it ended with a surprise 4\u20132 victory for the reserves, Roland Lewis scoring a hat-trick. Pre-season training consisted primarily of assistant manager Ken Fish leading a marathon running session from Burslem to Hanley and back to Burslem following a stop at a pub for a half-pint of shandy. After returning to the ground Fish would organise a practise game. The fitness work was actually crucial to the team's success, as Steele was ahead of his time in that he insisted that wide players should defend when the opposition were on the ball, in order to support the defence. Superstition was of great importance to Steele, who ensured that the team rigidly stuck their pre-match rituals such as the intricacies of kit layout and the order in which players entered the pitch.", "Vale lost by a single goal at Redheugh Park against Gateshead on 12 September; Vale, playing in their change kit, were beaten by a 57th-minute goal from John Ingham. This brought to an end the club's then-record streak of 16 games unbeaten. Four days later Vale recorded a 2\u20131 win over Bradford Park Avenue at the Horsfall Stadium despite Reg Potts being injured with a swollen ankle early in the match. A 2\u20130 home win over Workington on 19 September began a sequence of five clean sheets, with Jim Elsby standing in for Potts as Steele changed the starting line-up for the first time in eight games \u2013 this brought Potts' run of 73 consecutive appearances to an end. The defensive fivesome of keeper Ray King, Tommy Cheadle, Reg Potts, Stan Turner and Roy Sproson began to be known as 'the Iron Curtain' or 'the Steele Curtain' (a play on the manager's name). A 21 September game against nearby unbeaten Crewe Alexandra was billed as a 'crunch clash' between first and second, and a Sproson goal on 87 minutes won the match for the Vale. For the return a week later a stadium record 17,883 packed into Gresty Road to witness a goalless draw at Crewe. The attendance figures were helped by the management team of the Crewe Works, who allowed their workforce to leave work an hour early in order to make it for the 5:10pm kick-off. The draw was achieved despite injuries to Albert Leake, Hayward and John Cunliffe, who were replaced by Derek Tomkinson, Roland Lewis and Mick Hulligan.", "Steele was investigated by a joint FA/Football League inquiry for his time as Mansfield Town manager in regard to suspected illegal payments \u2013 found guilty, he was given a \u00a3250 fine. The good run of results continued though, as they beat fifth-placed Barnsley 1\u20130 at Oakwell through a Hayward goal. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day Vale recorded two 1\u20130 wins over Chester, with Hayward again the only player to find the net. Captain Tommy Cheadle pulled a hamstring against Chester, and lost his place in the team as Steele moved the positions around to accommodate Derek Tomkinson in the team. Roland Lewis was made available on a free transfer in December, and moved to non-league side Witton Albion.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Roland Lewis", "| December 1953 || FW ||  || Roland Lewis ||  || Released || "]}]}}
