He sought to modernize and expand Notre Dame by erecting buildings and adding to the campus art gallery and library, amassing what became a famous Dante collection, and pushing Notre Dame towards becoming a research university dedicated to scholarship. The congregation did not renew Zahm's term because of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the order into serious debt. In particular, his vision to make Notre Dame a research university was at odds with that of Andrew Morrissey (president from 1893 to 1905), who hoped to keep the institution a smaller boarding school. Morrissey's presidency remained largely focused on younger students and saw the construction of the Grotto, the addition of wings to Sorin Hall, and the erection of the first gymnasium. By 1900, student enrollment increased to more than 700, with most students still following the Commercial Course.The movement towards a research university was subsequently championed by John W. Cavanaugh, who modernized educational standards. An intellectual figure known for his literary gifts and his eloquent speeches, he dedicated himself to the school's academic reputation and to increasing number of students awarded bachelor's and master's degrees. As part of his efforts, he attracted a number of eminent scholars, established a chair in journalism, and introduced courses in chemical engineering. During his time as president, Notre Dame also rapidly became a significant force on the football field. In 1917, Notre Dame awarded its first degree to a woman, and its first bachelor's in 1922. However, female undergraduates did not become common until 1972. James A. Burns became president in 1919 and, following in the footsteps of Cavanaugh, in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, residence halls, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a law school. thumb|upright=1.25|The University of Notre Dame in 1903"]}, {"page": "Congregation of Holy Cross", "response": ["*Fr.

Prior to 1888, every college student was housed in the Main Building, with open dormitory areas. During the early mid-1880s, the Holy Cross priests experimented with private rooms for upper classmen with high academic grades and the results were positive. Since the Main Building was overcrowded with students, Father Edward Sorin decided to build a freestanding dormitory to expand residential space for students and alleviate the housing shortage. It was the first of its kind among all Catholic universities and one of the first among colleges across the country.  thumbnail|left|Sorin Hall ExteriorIt was designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, architect of the Main Building, Washington Hall (1881), and the Science Hall (1883 - today's LaFortune Student Center).

Lyons, one of Notre Dame's most distinguished early faculty members.History.html Joseph Lyons was born in Utica, NY, on November 7, 1834. Lyons first came to Notre Dame as a fifteen-year-old orphan in 1848, entering the shoemaker's shop in the Manual Labor School (nowadays Badin Hall) as an apprentice. By 1851 he had impressed even Father Sorin with his skills in shoemaking, his determination and his attitude. Lyons taught himself Latin at night while an apprentice. As a reward, the President awarded one free year of tuition at the University, and Lyons entered the seminary to study for the priesthood. After five years he decided to pursue a career in teaching instead of the priesthood. Lyons then again entered the university and graduated from Notre Dame in 1862 with  highest honors. He taught at Notre Dame as professor of English for 26 years and was one of the most beloved figures on campus, was widely popular among students and other faculty, and was heavily involved with many student societies such as the Columbian Literary and Debating Club, the St. Cecilia Philomathean Association, the St. Stanislaus Philopatran Society. He compiled the story of the University for the celebrations of the Silver Jubilee in 1867. His death on August 22, 1888 was met with an outpouring of grief, condolences, and letter from faculty, students, alumni, and friends of the university from all over the world. The funeral mass was celebrated by William Corby, Matthew J. Walsh, and Andrew Morrissey and the body was then buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery, where traditionally only Holy Cross priests and brothers lay. His was the first case of a lay man being buried there. In 1892, a monument was erected on his tomb, consisting of a granite obelisk with the words \"Erected to his memory as a tribute of the affection of the old students.\" and \"He was always the same-kind and gentle, sincere and self-sacrificing.\""]}, {"page": "ARTGO", "response": ["*2011 Andrew Morrissey"]}, {"page": "History of the University of Notre Dame", "response": ["Rev.
