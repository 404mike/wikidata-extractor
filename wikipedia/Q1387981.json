He became a naturalised British citizen in 1933, knighted in 1954 and made an honorary citizen of Ireland in 1957.\nHe was a collector of African, Asian, European and Middle Eastern manuscripts, rare printed books, prints and objets d'art. Upon his move to Dublin in 1950 he established the Chester Beatty Library on Shrewsbury Road to house his collection; it opened to the public in 1954. The Collections were bequeathed to the Irish people and entrusted to the care of the State in his Irish will. He donated a number of papyrus documents to the British Museum, his second wife's (Edith Dunn Beatty) collection of Marie Antoinette's personal furniture to the Louvre and a number of his personal paintings that once hung in the picture gallery of his London home to the National Gallery of Ireland. He also founded the Chester Beatty Institute in London which was later renamed the Institute of Cancer Research.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Papyrus", "response": ["* Chester Beatty Papyri: collection of 11 codices acquired by Alfred Chester Beatty in 1930\u20131931 and 1935.
