Nicknamed \"The Duke\" for his good dress sense, Sewell also had the distinction of never having been booked during his English playing career and only once throughout his entire playing career.A well-rounded young athlete, Sewell played fly-half at rugby so well that he was twice selected to play for England Schools\u2019 Under 15 team.  On leaving school, he first became a sprinter with Blackheath Harriers, and then signed as a \u201cprofessional footballer\u201d for Bexleyheath & Welling in 1954.\nA key man at centre-half in the Kent League team at Bexleyheath, Sewell was transferred to Charlton Athletic on January 5, 1955.  Almost immediately, he spent two years in national service, and finally made his league debut at right-half against Sheffield Wednesday in January 1957, a year in which the club struggled (and ultimately failed) to avoid relegation from the First Division.  After not making the first team the following season, he was named again to the squad at Christmas, 1958 \u2013 this time at full-back, a position he played for the rest of his career.\nSewell made 204 first team appearances for Charlton, scoring 5 goals, before signing for London rivals Crystal Palace on October 25, 1963.  Between 1963 and 1971, he made 258 appearances for Palace, scoring nine goals, mainly from the penalty spot.  He became club captain in 1967-68, when Alan Stephenson left to join West Ham, and in 1969, led Palace to the First Division for the first time in the club\u2019s history.  \nIn 1970, his last season with Palace, he scored his best remembered goal in the closing seconds of a Division One match against league leaders Leeds United.  The visitors were a goal up when the ball came to Sewell, thirty yards from goal, who chose to hit a speculative lob back into the penalty area.  The Leeds goalkeeper, Gary Sprake, caught the ball at the goal line, and then inexplicably dropped it behind him into his own net.  \nIn 1971, Sewell received a testimonial for his services to Palace, against Belgian club RFC Bruges.  It was his last game in a Palace shirt.  That same year, he joined an exodus of players leaving Selhurst Park to join their former coach George Petchey at Leyton Orient.  After just one season, however, he left for America to play in the fledgling North American Soccer League for the St. Louis Stars (later the California Surf, based in Anaheim), where he stayed as player and coach for eight years.  In 1975, he was named NASL Coach of the Year, for his success guiding a St. Louis squad comprised almost exclusively of home-grown American players, an oddity in the era of Pel\u00e9, Franz Beckenbauer, and other high-priced imports.\nHis soccer career at a close, Sewell stayed in California for almost thirty years, before retiring to Washington state in 2006. He died in Sequim, Washington on 19 November 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)", "response": ["|1975 || Steve David || Chris Bahr || John Sewell"]}, {"page": "California Surf", "response": ["The Surf opened the 1978 North American Soccer League season at home with a 1\u20130 victory against the Portland Timbers on 1 April 1978. The team finished the season in second place in the Western Division of the American Conference with 13 wins and 17 loses and losing to the San Diego Sockers in the first round of the playoffs.   After a 4-4 start to the 1979 season, John Sewell, who had managed the team in St. Louis, was fired as head coach and replaced by Peter Wall.  The Surf finished the season with a record of 15 wins and 15 losses, tied for first place of the American Conference, Western Division on points with San Diego, but losing the division title on goal differential.  For the second year in a row, the team exited the playoffs after losing to San Diego in the first round.  The team reported an official average attendance of 10,330 for the season; however, it was midway through the following season, it was reported that the Surf had been inflating their attendance totals. In September 1979 it was announced that the Surf would be one of ten teams to participate in the 1979\u201380 NASL Indoor season.  During the league's first ever full indoor season, the Surf compiled a record of four wins and eight loses and failed to qualify for the playoffs.  In the following outdoor season, the Surf compiled a record of 15 wins and 17 loses while finishing in second place in the Western Division of the American Conference.  The team was defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the Fort Lauderdale Strikers.  After the season, it was announced that the team had ranked 20th in league attendance and was rumored to have lost nearly $7.5 million. The Surf competed in the 1980\u201381 NASL Indoor season finishing first in the Southern Division, but again bowing out in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the Vancouver Whitecaps.  After opening the 1981 NASL season, with a 4 - 3 record, Peter Wall resigned as head coach and was replaced by Laurie Calloway.  The team finished the season with a record of 11 wins and 21 losses and did not qualify for the playoffs.  On September 15, 1981 it was announced the team was ceasing operations.  The next day, the league announced the Surf were one of five teams that failed to post the required $150,000 bond to participate in the 1981\u201382 NASL Indoor season, confirming the team has folded.", "*  John Sewell (1978\u20131979)"]}, {"page": "St. Louis Stars (soccer)", "response": ["The Stars best season was 1972.

Pat McBride (MF) and John Sewell (DF) were named first team all-stars for the 1972 season.  The team's success reinvigorated fan appeal, leading the league in attendance in 1972 with close to 8,000 fans per match, and continuing to draw over 6,000 fans each season from 1972 to 1977.", "In 1975 the Stars signed a foreign star in Peter Bonetti.  Bonetti had played for England from 1966\u20131970, was the backup goalkeeper to Gordon Banks on England's winning team in the 1966 World Cup, and had started one match at the 1970 World Cup. Bonetti had a solid season with the Stars, and was named a NASL first-team all-star for the 1975 season. The Stars won the Central Division in 1975, defeated the L.A. Aztecs in the quarterfinals at Busch Memorial Stadium, and lost to the Portland Timbers in the semifinals.  John Sewell was named NASL Coach of the Year.", "By 1977, the Stars emphasis on American players had begun to erode slightly. Although the 1977 squad was still mostly American, the squad did include eight Englishmen. There was an attempt to return to Busch for 1978, but the Stars were not able to secure a lease to their liking. With only small Francis Field available as an option and player salaries rising sharply, there seemed little alternative but to move. So after the 1977 season, the Stars moved to Anaheim and became the California Surf. Although the California Surf retained their core group of American (mostly St. Louis) players, under English coach  John Sewell the California Surf imported more English players.", "* 1975 John Sewell", "* 1972 Pat McBride, John Sewell", "* 1973 John Sewell, Al Trost", "*  John Sewell (1974\u201378)"]}, {"page": "Steve Kember", "response": ["In the top flight, Kember continued to impress, gaining England U23 caps, and in the summer of 1971, having helped Palace to survival, he replaced John Sewell as captain, following Sewell's departure to Orient."]}, {"page": "List of Charlton Athletic F.C. players", "response": ["|John Sewell||||DF/MF||1956\u201364||204||5"]}, {"page": "1975 North American Soccer League season", "response": ["*Coach of the year: John Sewell, St. Louis"]}]}}
