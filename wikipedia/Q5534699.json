It wrote two reports, Wales 2010 and Cardiff Euro Capital, which had \u201chighlighted a need to project Cardiff's identity and its strength as the \"cultural capital of a musical nation.\u201d Yet in 1996, the Millennium Commission refused funding for Zaha Hadid\u2019s Cardiff Bay Opera House, and the project appeared unlikely to succeed. The Independent newspaper however reported the IWA had persisted, having taken \u201cup the reins (of the project) with grim determination.\u201d Supported by Anthony Freud, director of the Welsh National Opera and Michael Trickey, director of policy and planning at the Arts Council of Wales, the Institute began fielding ideas for the project which had been rejected by both the Millennium Commission and the general public during Wales Secretary John Redwood\u2019s unsuccessful consultation. The establishment of an arts centre had been key to the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation\u2019s plans for what was at the time \u201cthe biggest such inner- city undertaking in Europe\u201d, and which was forecast to cost \u00a32.75bn in 1997 (\u00a34.9bn adjusted for 2019 inflation). At the time, CDBC Chairman Geoffrey Inkin stated he had \u201cno great hopes for the initiative taken by the Institute of Welsh Affairs\u201d, but the Institute\u2019s then Director John Osmond said at the time that it had \u201cbrokered a (public-private) package to bring the lights up again on the project.\u201d The work of the IWA in drawing attention to what it said was \u201csome 83 per cent of arts funding from the Lottery\u201d going to England, as well as its leadership in pushing the now Wales Millennium Centre to seek Millennium Commission, Arts Council, and Heritage Fund investment, is attributed as being hugely impactful on the later construction of the Centre."]}]}}
