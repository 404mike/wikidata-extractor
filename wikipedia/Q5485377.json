He was born at Wolverhampton and died at Coventry.\nBolus was used by Somerset as a lower-order right-handed batsman, and bowled only three overs in his 10 games for the county, although he took a wicket in a non-first-class match for Somerset against the 1894 South Africans played after his last first-class match for the team. A surviving scorecard from a club match involving Frome Cricket Club suggests that at club cricket level he was regarded as an all-rounder. For Somerset, he made innings of 16 and 23 in his first game against Yorkshire. But the 23 remained his highest first-class score, although he was given seven matches in 1893 and three more in 1894, and his career batting average was only seven runs per innings.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
