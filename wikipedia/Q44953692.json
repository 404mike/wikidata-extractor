It was released digitally on March 17, 2015, and physically on March 18 by SM Entertainment and distributed by KT Music, marking the group's first proper release since their initial debut in August 2014 and their first release as a quintet since the addition of the group's fifth member Yeri. The extended play was released in two physical versions, named after the two singles and contained six tracks which introduced both the group's \"Red\" and \"Velvet\" sonic concept. The duality was further demonstrated by its two singles (marketed as double title tracks), \"Automatic\" and \"Ice Cream Cake\", with the latter becoming the group's breakthrough commercial success. S.M. founder Lee Soo-man served as the EP's executive producer, with Hayley Aitken, Trinity Music, Daniel \"Obi\" Klein, Charli Taft, Jam Factory, Kenzie, Teddy Riley, Cha Cha Malone, MonoTree and others contributed lyrics and production.", "The extended play starts with the same-name track \"Ice Cream Cake\", a \"punchy, sugary pop confection\" that consists elements from dance-rock, bubblegum-pop and drum and bass. Produced by Hayley Aitken and producing team Trinity Music, the song original title was \"Ice Cream Truck\" before the lyrics was rewritten in Korean by songwriter Jo Yoon-kyung and Kim Dong-hyun. In addition, it also features \"haunted\" harmony which can be heard during the intro of the song, while being accompanied by the sound of a music box. The lyrics tell the excitement of a girl being attracted to her boyfriend, using \"ice cream cake\" as a metaphor to the girl's feelings. Along with the electro-pop \"Stupid Cupid\" and the bright, poppy \"Take It Slow\", the three tracks represent the \"Red\" concept, with \"Stupid Cupid\" offers a different \"aura\" through the electric riffs, and \"Take It Slow\" highlights the group's harmonization and soft vocals that recalls \"the perfection\" from fellow labelmate Girls' Generation-TTS.In contrast, the second track \"Automatic\" is \"a surely implemented R&B track\" with influence from neo soul, thus represents the \"Velvet\" sonic concept. Produced by Daniel \"Obi\" Klein and British singer-songwriter Charli Taft, the song was the first work from the duo with Red Velvet (whom would later participate in the group's upcoming releases). Lyrically, the song tells how \"natural\" and \"automatic\" the senses and feelings of a girl come just by the touch of her lover, with the opening monologue \"How do you like this beat?/Natural and automatic for you.\" Charli Taft also co-produced the third track \"Something Kinda Crazy\", a modern-R&B track with synth-pop influence that sings about the starstruck feelings of a girl when she falls in a relationship. The lyrics was written by songwriter Kenzie, with American producer Teddy Riley joined in the production. The closing track \"Candy\" is a \"smoothing, popping\" R&B track that sings about the wishes of a long-lasting relationship. These three tracks eventually represent the group's \"Velvet\" concept, portraying the group's \"sultry\" images and music."]}, {"page": "Tsuki (song)", "response": ["* Charli Taft - songwriter (track #2)"]}, {"page": "The Red (album)", "response": ["The Red is the debut studio album by South Korean girl group Red Velvet.

It was one of three tracks produced by Daniel \"Obi\" Klein along with the next track \"Time Slip\", which is a 90s-influenced hip hop-based R&B song with lyrics that describes the laziness and listlessness that one feels while going back and forth between dream and reality in the morning. \"Time Slip\" also sees the participation of British songwriter Charli Taft, whom had previously co-written and produced \"Automatic\" along with Daniel Klein, while marking the first collaboration from South Korean music producer Jinbo for the girl group. The eighth track \"Don't U Wait No More\" highlights the group's harmonization over a heavy synth production with a harmonized \"Don't you wait no more\" hook, with the lyrics revolve around a girl trying to get closer to her hesitant boyfriend, followed by the bossa nova-influenced midtempo pop-rock track \"Day 1\", which describes the feeling of new love by combining the electric, funky guitar sound and the melodic piano with the vocals of the members.
