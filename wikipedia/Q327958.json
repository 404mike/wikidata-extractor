The book inspired her to begin writing, and she penned her first story called \"Stormy\", a fictionalized account of the life of her cat from the cat's perspective, soon after. Sellers believes that any writer is influenced by every writer they've read. Sellers' favourite authors include Doris Lessing, Jane Austen, Robertson Davies and  romance authors such as Jane Donnelly and Mary Burchell. Among books that have strongly influenced her are The Sufis by Idries Shah, The Thousand and One Nights translated by Richard Burton, Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion, by Jane Austen.
