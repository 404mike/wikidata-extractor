Biographer Thomas Forget added, \"Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.\" In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the \"most influential artist of all time\" in a poll by NME. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be \"the most important and influential artist since the Beatles\". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had \"one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century\" and \"he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with\". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for \"the creative powerhouse that Britain has become\" by challenging future generations \"to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks\". Easton concluded that Bowie had \"changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself\". In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's Culture Show. Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press wrote, \"Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie\". In 2016, he was dubbed \"The Greatest Rock Star Ever\" by Rolling Stone."]}, {"page": "Genesis (band)", "response": ["Journalists have reported that fans preferring one era of the band strongly dislike others. Rock author Colin McGuire has described the arguments from fans of the Gabriel era as \"they sold out and became too corporate when Collins stepped into the spotlight\", while fans of the Collins era argue \"the Gabriel years were boring and hard to stomach\". He concluded both eras of the band should be judged on their own merits. The band themselves have been aware of these divides; press interviews for Abacab explicitly stated that fans of Foxtrot might not like the album, but should keep an open mind. Ultimate Classic Rock stated, \"There are few groups in the classic-rock canon with a more divisive discography than Genesis... there's no arguing that they helped create the template for prog-rock and made some of the genre's most essential albums\", but continued \"the Genesis sound gradually grew less and less progressive, until the band became a straight-up pop act. Good luck finding anybody out there who's equally enamored of both sides of the band's story.\" On their legacy, Q reviewer Andy Fyfe wrote in 2007 that \"little of the band's output has aged well\" and \"transcends in the way real classics do\", stating they would \"remain perennial whipping boys for decades to come\".Andy Fyfe. \"Proggy Style\". Q. May 2007. Issue 250. p. 136.

After acquiring his first delay pedal, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, he became fascinated with how to use its return echo to \"fill in notes that [he's] not playing, like two guitar players rather than one\". The effect unit became a mainstay in his guitar rig and had a significant impact on the band's creative output. The Edge became known for his extensive use of effects units, and for his meticulous nature in crafting specific sounds and guitar tones from his equipment choices. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page called him a \"sonic architect\", while Neil McCormick described him as an \"effects maestro\". Critics have variously referred to the Edge's guitar sounds as evoking the image of fighter planes on \"Bullet the Blue Sky\", resembling a \"dentist's drill\" on \"Love Is Blindness\", and resembling an \"airplane turbine\" on \"Mofo\". The Edge said that rather than using effects merely to modify his sound, he uses them to spark ideas during his songwriting process."]}, {"page": "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "response": ["Writing in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Sheffield described Sgt. Pepper as \"a revelation of how far artists could go in a recording studio with only four tracks, plenty of imagination, and a drug or two\", but also \"a masterwork of sonics, not songwriting\". In his review for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham said that, while the album's detractors typically bemoan McCartney's dominant role, the reliance on studio innovation, and the unconvincing concept, \"as long as there are pairs of ears willing to disappear under headphones for forty minutes... Sgt. Pepper will continue to cast its considerable spell.\" Among reviews of the 2009 remastered album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph wrote: \"It is impossible to overstate its impact: from a contemporary Sixties perspective it was utterly mind-blowing and original. Looking back from a point when its sonic innovations have been integrated into the mainstream, it remains a wonky, colourful and wildly improbable pop classic, although a little slighter and less cohesive than it may have seemed at the time.\" Mark Kemp, writing for Paste, said the album was a \"blast of avant-rock genius\" but also \"one of rock's most overrated albums\"."]}, {"page": "Help!", "response": ["Mark Kemp of Paste considers it to be the equal of A Hard Day's Night and cites \"Help!\", \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"Act Naturally\" as highlights, along with Harrison's return as a songwriter. Kemp identifies \"Yesterday\" as \"the album's masterpiece\" and a song that \"set the stage for one of the most groundbreaking and innovative periods in The Beatles' career, not to mention pop music in general\". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph says that the album evokes \"a band in transition, shifting slightly uncomfortably from the pop thrills of Beatlemania to something more mature\", with Lennon's writing increasingly autobiographical and the group's sound growing more sophisticated. McCormick concludes: \"Help! may not be their greatest album, but it contains some of their greatest early songs.\""]}, {"page": "Rubber Soul", "response": ["Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph wrote in 2009: \"this is where things start to get very interesting\u00a0... Rubber Soul is the result of their first extended period in the studio. The production is open and spacious, adorned but not yet overcrowded with new instruments and ideas. The songs themselves are like little Pop Art vignettes, where the lyrics are starting to match the quality of the melodies and arrangements.\" Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork describes the album as \"the most important artistic leap in the Beatles' career \u2013 the signpost that signaled a shift away from Beatlemania and the heavy demands of teen pop, toward more introspective, adult subject matter\". Paul Du Noyer wrote in his review for Blender in 2004: \"Their talent was already a source of wonder, but now the songs themselves were turning mysterious. Under the influence of Bob Dylan \u2013 and, it might be said, marijuana \u2013 the Fab Four laced their tunefulness with new introspection, wordplay and social comment. University professors and newspaper columnists started taking note.\""]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes Revolver as \"the ultimate modern pop album\". While noting the diverse musical directions adopted by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison in their respective contributions, he states: \"The biggest miracle of Revolver may be that the Beatles covered so much new stylistic ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of it holds together perfectly.\" In his review for The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick says that the album shows the band at their most unified and is a work in which \"they introduce whole new vistas of sound yet still contain them within tightly structured and performed songs.\" He also attributes an acerbic quality to the album that psychedelia lacked once the genre succumbed to \"the woolly politics of flower power\". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork views Revolver as a \"sonic landmark\" that, in its lyrics, \"matur[ed] pop from the stuff of teen dreams to a more serious pursuit that actively reflected and shaped the times in which its creators lived\". He considers it to be McCartney's \"maturation record\" as a songwriter in the same way that Rubber Soul had been for Lennon."]}, {"page": "The Edge", "response": ["The Edge's guitar sound is frequently modulated with a delay set to a dotted eighth note for rhythmic effect.

He singles out \"some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I've Got a Feeling' and 'Dig a Pony'\", and praises \"Let It Be\", \"Get Back\" and \"the folky 'Two of Us'\". Reviewing for The Daily Telegraph in 2009, Neil McCormick described Let It Be as a \"slightly sad postscript\", adding, \"there are still monster tunes here by anyone else's standards, but it lacks sonic clarity, and is peppered with under-developed, sub-standard blues.\""]}, {"page": "Magical Mystery Tour", "response": ["Writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Sheffield said that the album was \"a lot goopier than Sgt. Pepper, though lifted by the cheerful 'All You Need Is Love' and the ghostly 'Strawberry Fields Forever.' Her Majesty the Queen had the best comment: 'The Beatles are turning awfully funny, aren't they?'\" Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph wrote that the combination of soundtrack and singles meant the album lacked cohesion, but he still found it an \"intriguing psychedelic companion piece\" to Sgt. Pepper and highlighted \"I Am the Walrus\" as a \"mad, surrealist epic ... in which Lennon takes the concept of lyrical and musical nonsense and just explodes it all over the speakers\". Reviewing for Mojo in 2002, Charles Shaar Murray said Magical Mystery Tour was the Beatles album he turned to most often following Harrison's death the previous year and that it evokes an era \"when society still seemed to be opening up rather than closing down\". Given its experimental qualities, he deemed it \"the other half of the double-album that Sgt. Pepper should have been\". Writing for Paste, Mark Kemp views Magical Mystery Tour as a work of \"symphonic sprawl\" that marks the culmination of a five-year period in which the Beatles led pop music's expansion into world music, psychedelia, avant-pop and electronica, while bringing the genre a bohemian audience for the first time. He says that while the album resembles a Sgt. Pepper \"Part 2\", it \"breathes easier and includes stronger songs\" and benefits from the lack of a \"forced concept\"."]}, {"page": "Suede (band)", "response": ["Suede's laurels would remain intact through their early career until Butler's departure, which the press signalled as the end of Suede. As new rock bands were arriving on the scene, British pop culture was in the midst of a shift towards lad culture and the same critics who championed Suede were now plotting to extinguish them. In February 1995, music critic J.D. Considine said the band \"quickly fell victim to the build-'em-up-then-knock-'em-down mentality of the English music press.\" On the eve of the release of Coming Up, Neil McCormick of The Telegraph wrote: \"Cast in the classic mould of the androgynous rock star, Anderson appears curiously anachronistic in a British rock scene polarised between the laddishness of Oasis and the suburbiana of Blur and Pulp.\" In a 2007 article in The Telegraph, Bernadette McNulty wrote that while the frontmen of those bands \"are all being bestowed with reverential status, Brett Anderson has become the lost boy of Britpop\". Since the Britpop movement ceased to exist, like many bands associated with it, Suede's popularity sharply declined. As one writer put it at the end of Suede's career, \"Suede slid from zeitgeist into a smaller, pocket-sized cult band.\" In the same article, Anderson spoke about their legacy:"]}, {"page": "Richard Thompson (musician)", "response": ["Music critic Neil McCormick described Thompson as \"a versatile virtuoso guitarist and a sharp observational singer-songwriter whose work burns with intelligence and dark emotion\". His songwriting has earned him an Ivor Novello Award and, in 2006, a lifetime achievement award from BBC Radio.

Music journalist Neil McCormick, writing in 2015, described the Beatles' debut on the show as pop music's \"big bang moment\", while Stanley calls it \"arguably the most significant postwar cultural event in America\", adding that \"Their rise, the scale of it and their impact on society, was completely unprecedented.\" Their second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, on 16 February, was watched by around 70\u00a0million viewers."]}, {"page": "Blonde on Blonde", "response": ["Describing the process of listening to all these alternative versions, Neil McCormick wrote: \"The Cutting Edge allows fans to bear witness to perhaps the most astonishing explosion of language and sound in rock history, a new approach to song being forged before our very ears.\""]}, {"page": "Hail to the Thief", "response": ["Hail to the Thief has a score of 85 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called it \"Radiohead firing on all cylinders, a major work by major artists at the height of their powers\". Chris Ott of Pitchfork wrote that Radiohead had \"largely succeeded in their efforts to shape pop music into as boundless and possible a medium as it should be,\" assigning it a \"Best New Music\" designation. New York critic Ethan Brown said that Hail to the Thief \"isn't a protest album, and that's why it works so well. As with great Radiohead records past, such as Kid A, the music \u2013 restlessly, freakishly inventive \u2013 pushes politics far into the background.\" Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that \"despite the fact that it seems more like a bunch of songs on a disc rather than a singular body, its impact is substantial\", concluding that the band \"have entered a second decade of record-making with a surplus of momentum\".

Music & Media stated that it \"combines moody soundscapes with some grunge-y guitar attacks that together make an arresting number\".

Neil McCormick has similarly credited Cauty and Paterson with inventing the genre, in The Daily Telegraph. In 1989, Paul Oakenfold ran the acid house night at Heaven, and Paterson ran a chill-out counterpart in the White Room with Cauty and Youth. There, Paterson spun Brian Eno, Pink Floyd, and 10CC songs at low volume and accompanied them with multiscreen video projections.
