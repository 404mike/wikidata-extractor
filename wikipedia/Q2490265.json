Suggs began his solo career in 1995, while still a member of Madness. Since then, he has released two studio albums and two compilation albums. His solo hits include \"I'm Only Sleeping\", \"Camden Town\", \"Cecilia\" and \"Blue Day\".\nSuggs has also been an actor, with roles in films, theatre and television. He is married and is the father of two children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Madness (band)", "response": ["This six-piece line-up lasted until part-way through 1977, when Graham McPherson (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's garden. Tulane went on to be an actor under the name Dikran Tulaine. Smyth, who left after an argument with Barson, was replaced by Gavin Rodgers, Barson's girlfriend's brother. McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch Chelsea instead of rehearsing. Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing.", "In 1981, the band's third studio album, 7, reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart and contained three hit singles: \"Grey Day\" (no. 4, April 1981), \"Shut Up\" (no. 7, September 1981), and \"Cardiac Arrest\" (no. 14, February 1982). In an article in 1979, Chris Foreman explained that the band's music would move with the times, and change styles as time goes on. (The full article was also included on the back cover of the Absolutely LP.) This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two ska-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, 7 was something of a change in direction. Suggs' vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong accent from the previous albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of One Step Beyond... and Absolutely and moved towards a pop sound; a trend that continued with subsequent albums.", "In 1985, the label released the band's sixth album, Mad Not Mad. Barson's keyboard parts were filled by synthesisers and Steve Nieve joined the band to take his place. In later years, frontman Suggs described the album as a \"polished turd\". The album reached number 16 in the UK charts, which was the band's lowest position on the album charts to date. Despite the poor chart showing, the album was listed as number 55 in NMEs \"All Time 100 Albums\". The singles for the album fared even worse, with \"Yesterday's Men\" peaking at number 18 in the UK charts. The subsequent singles, \"Uncle Sam\" and \"Sweetest Girl\", failed to make the top 20, which was a first for Madness singles.", "The band then attempted to record a new album, and 11 demo tracks were recorded. However, musical differences arose between the band members. The untitled album went unreleased, and in September 1986, the band announced that they were to split. Barson rejoined the band for a farewell single, \"(Waiting For) The Ghost Train\", but did not appear in the music video. The band officially split following the release of the single, which reached a high of number 18 in the UK. In 1988, four members of the band\u00a0\u2013 Suggs, Chas Smash, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman\u00a0\u2013 continued under the name The Madness. After one self-titled album and two singles that failed to make the top 40, the band split.", "From 28 October 2002 to 16 August 2003, a musical based on Madness songs, Our House, ran at the Cambridge Theatre in London. Madness played a role in the executive production of the show, and Suggs played a role in the production for a period, playing the central character's father.Shenton, Mark.  It won an Olivier Award for best new musical of 2003, and the performance was released on DVD on 1 November 2004. There was also a previous musical based on Madness songs, One Step Beyond!, written by Alan Gilbey.\"Theatre Review\", The Guardian, 13 April 1993. The musical had a brief run at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1993 and a run at Putney Arts Theatre, London in 2012.", "The new Madness song \"NW5\" (then still titled \"NW5 (I Would Give You Everything)\") and a re-recorded version of \"It Must Be Love\" were featured in the German film Neues vom Wixxer. The two songs were released in Germany as a double A-Side, and both of them were turned into music videos, which\u00a0\u2013 besides members of the film's cast\u00a0\u2013 featured Suggs, Chas Smash, Woody and stand-in guitarist Burdette.

Formed by Suggs, Chas Smash, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman in 1988, they distinguished this line-up from the previous Madness line-up only by adding the word \"The\" to the band's name. The band had held a competition to find a new name on Radio 1. They decided on 'The Wasp Factory' after the Iain Banks novel, but that name had already been taken by another band.", "Madness collaborated with Elvis Costello in 1983 on a version of their song \"Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)\". It was released as a bonus track to the 12\" copy of the single. In later years, Barson stated that Costello's \"Watching the Detectives\" was the main influence on the song \"My Girl\". For Wonderful in 1999, Ian Dury laid down vocals on the track \"Drip Fed Fred\" which was released as the last single from the album. It was Dury's last recording before his death. Ill health prevented Dury from actively promoting the single, although he did appear on the National Lottery Show, for a later performance on TFI Friday, the song was reworked to incorporate Phill Jupitus on vocals. Live, Madness have collaborated with artists including UB40 and Prince Buster, notably at their first Madstock concert. They have also played live frequently with members of the other 2 Tone bands including The Specials. In May 2008, Suggs and Carl performed live with Pet Shop Boys at London's Heaven collaborating on a new arrangement of \"My Girl\".
