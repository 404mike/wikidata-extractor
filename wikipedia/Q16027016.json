Bradford. It dates back to around 1875 but it was Alfred Pettitt, who was the publican there in the first quarter of the twentieth century, who commissioned a total make-over. Pettitt called in H. Fuller-Clark and he was to transform the building!   Hitch and Callcott worked on the first phase of the building's decoration in around 1905 with Hitch carving a series of stone grotesques on the exterior and similar work in wood for the interior. The second phase started in 1917 and now Hitch carved in oak a relief featuring music making monkeys for the bracket for the clock with the motto \"Tones Make the Music\" and also carved the tiny capitals, with the names of drinks and other mottoes on them, in the simulated window embrasure of the niche or snug. The two monkeys forming the clock bracket play viola de gamba and horn.  There are ten of the miniature capitals, each one illustrating a word or phrase:  \"Rum Punch\" \"Food\", etc.Public Sculpture of the City of London by Philip Ward-Jackson. 2003.
