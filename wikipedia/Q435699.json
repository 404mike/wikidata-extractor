Kierkegaard is not regarded as a philosopher, nor are Feuerbach and his pupil Nietzsche, but they are extraordinarily instructive. All who construct an empty system with facts are fools. Such is Bostr\u00f6m, who tries to subtilise conceptions, analyse ideas, and classify and arrange God, man, and human life under heads.
