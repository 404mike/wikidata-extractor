He qualified in 1930, and practiced in Manchester.In October 1930, Hope was adopted as the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Stalybridge and Hyde, and contested it at the 1931 general election. The seat had been traditionally Conservative, but had been taken by Edmund Walter Hanbury Wood, a Labour candidate, at the previous general election. He did not, however, stand for re-election, and as part of an overall Conservative landslide victory, Hope took the seat with a comfortable majority of 13,300 votes over the Liberal and Labour candidates. At 26, he was one of the youngest members of parliament elected that year; the Baby of the House, Roland Robinson, was only two years younger.\nHe did not make his maiden speech until 1934, when he objected to proposals to move Cheadle and Gatley into Greater Manchester.Hope did not run for re-election at the 1935 general election, though in May 1935 it was reported that he was considering looking for a safer seat. In 1950, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stalybridge and Hyde (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sydney Hope"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sydney Hope"]}, {"page": "Glossopdale School", "response": ["* Sydney Hope, Conservative MP from 1931-35 for Stalybridge and Hyde"]}]}}
