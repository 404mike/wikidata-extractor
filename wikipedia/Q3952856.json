Chelsea appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who subsequently lifted the sanctions on the club and the player after ruling that Kakuta did not have a valid contract with Lens, and therefore could not have breached it. Chelsea's transfer ban was suspended later in the same year, and was lifted in February 2010. Harry Redknapp, manager of Tottenham Hotspur at that time, has said that activity which verges upon 'tapping-up' regularly occurs in deals between Premier League clubs, and Scott Minto, a pundit for Sky Sports, said that the ban was \"extremely harsh\" because of the frequency of it.
