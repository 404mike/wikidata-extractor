However, Ford's expertise in nuts and bolts electioneering stood him in good stead.  Although Alliance's vote almost halved, Ford's own vote in South Antrim increased from 8.6% to 9.1%. Meehan's vote increased dramatically, from 7.3% to 11.5%, and he started the election count ahead. Ford had much greater transfer appeal and finished 180 votes ahead of Meehan at the end of a dramatic three-way fight for the last two seats, with the SDLP's Thomas Burns just 14 votes ahead of Ford. Despite the dramatic fall in vote, Alliance held on to its six seats in the Assembly, which remained suspended."]}, {"page": "Thomas Burns", "response": ["Thomas Burns, Tommy Burns or Tom Burns may refer to:", "* Thomas Burns (politician) (born 1960), Nationalist Northern Irish politician", "* Thomas Burns (minister, born 1796) (1796\u20131871), minister and founding settler of Dunedin, New Zealand", "* Thomas Burns (minister, born 1853) (1853\u20131938), Scottish minister"]}, {"page": "1960 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["**Thomas Burns, SDLP MLA."]}, {"page": "List of members of the 3rd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Thomas Burns", "|Thomas Burns"]}, {"page": "South Antrim (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=4|Thomas Burns(SDLP)"]}, {"page": "2005 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Thomas Burns"]}, {"page": "2001 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Thomas Burns"]}, {"page": "1997 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Thomas Burns"]}, {"page": "2011 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Thomas Burns"]}, {"page": "2019 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Thomas Burns"]}]}}
