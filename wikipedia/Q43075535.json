It also discusses Turing's contributions to computer science both before and after the war, omitting technical details. It contains previously unpublished material such as photographs and letters, in particular describing the nature of Turing's work in World War II between 1942 and 1945, much of which was not public knowledge beforehand. Reviews of it are mostly positive.", "Alan Turing (1912\u20131954) was a 20th-century mathematician and a significant early contributor to the fields of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He is well known for his work on cryptanalysis of the Enigma during World War II, to help decode German military intelligence.

Other literature includes Alan M. Turing (1959, new edition in 2012), by his mother Ethel Sara Turing, and Turing: The Pioneer of the Information Age (2012) by Jack Copeland.

Dermot Turing found correspondence from his father indicating that Turing was having relationship issues with a man named Roy near to his death. He also published excerpts from letters Turing wrote to his friend Nick Furbank, relating to Turing's chemical castration and relationship with his mother after he was convicted for homosexuality. The book also contains previously unpublished photographs of Turing on holiday as a young boy. Dermot Turing disputed a popular perception of Alan Turing as solitary in nature. People found that Turing was difficult to understand rather than deliberately uncooperative, and though he may have been uncomfortable around new people, he was \"vibrant, humorous, fun to be with and social\" amongst his friends.", "In \"Prof\" and \"Looking Glass War\", Dermot Turing writes about his uncle's role in World War II, where he worked on code-breaking for Britain at Bletchley Park and then on encrypting voice communications. The book also details the cracking of German teleprinter ciphers with the codename \"fish\" and the research and development of the Colossus computers. \"Lousy Computer\" and \"Taking Shape\" follow Turing's work at the National Physical Laboratory and Victoria University of Manchester, respectively.
