Their fast-paced version peaked at number four on the R&B charts and number thirty-five on the Hot 100. The New Birth version is the better-known version and has garnered praise. In 1975 Columbia records released a third version of this classic track. The least known of the three, this version by Kokomo, a British-soul group, includes delicately mixed congas with a tempo similar to New Birth's and is perhaps, musically, the funkiest of the three. Lead singer Tony O'Malley's vocal style is reminiscent of [Dr. John]'s. The background harmonies and ad-libs make this an outstanding track."]}]}}
