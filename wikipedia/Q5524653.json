Bird was a regular in his first season at the club, finishing as the club's top scorer for the 1997\u201398 season with 18 goals, before eventually following Molby to his next club, Kidderminster Harriers, following his release from Swansea in 2000. Molby's assistant at Kidderminster was Bird's former Barry Town manager Gary Barnett. He made his debut for the Harriers on 12 August 2000 against Torquay United, but suffered a goal drought at the club for several months, leading manager Molby to publicly offer his backing to Bird, commenting:\"It's a nightmare from a striker's point of view. He's trying his hardest, maybe a little bit too hard, but I'm sure it will all come good in the end.\" He eventually scored his first goals on his 17th appearance of the season, netting a late brace during a 2\u20131 victory over Kingstonian in a Championship Shield match on 8 November 2000. He was transfer listed in January 2001, but managed to force his way back into the side by switching to a right-midfield position during an injury crisis at the club. He credited being placed on the transfer list as his motivation to prove himself at the club, stating: \"What happened with the transfer-listing gave me a good kick up the backside. It made me get my head down and I concentrated on working hard.\""]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Barnett||||MF||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Barnett||||MF||45 (1)||7||6||2||4||1||5||1||60 (1)||11"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Barnett||||MF||27+4||3||3||0||5||2||2||0||0+1||0||37+5||5"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Barnett||||MF||19 (3)||1||1||0||2||0||0 (1)||0||37 (5)||5"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Gary Barnett||||1990\u20131993||92 (8)||11||10||2||11||3||7 (1)||1||0 (1)||0||120 (10)||17"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["|  Gary Barnett"]}, {"page": "Jim Hicks (footballer)", "response": ["In the summer of 1985, Oxford sent Hicks, Gary Barnett and around \u00a3150,000 to Fulham in exchange for Ray Houghton.
