She was born between 961 and 964 and died on 16 September in a year between 984 and 987. Following her death in 984, she became the patron saint of her community at Wilton Abbey in Wiltshire and churches were dedicated to her in Wiltshire and in other parts of Anglo-Saxon England.

With his proneness to fits of rage and his love of hunting, Edward the Confessor is regarded by most historians as an unlikely saint, and his canonisation as political, although some argue that his cult started so early that it must have had something credible to build on."]}, {"page": "Edward the Martyr", "response": ["Later sources of questionable reliability address the identity of Edward's mother. The earliest such source is a life of Dunstan by Osbern of Canterbury, probably written in the 1080s. Osbern writes that Edward's mother was a nun at Wilton Abbey whom the king seduced.Hart, \"Edward\", p. 783; Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 3. When Eadmer wrote a life of Dunstan some decades later, he included an account of Edward's parentage obtained from Nicholas of Worcester. This denied that Edward was the son of a liaison between Edgar and a nun, presenting him as the son of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, daughter of Ordm\u00e6r, \"ealdorman of the East Anglians\", whom Edgar had married in the years when he ruled Mercia (between 957 and Eadwig's death in 959).Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 3\u20134. Additional accounts are offered by Goscelin in his life of Edgar's daughter Saint Edith of Wilton and in the histories of John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury.Hart, \"Edward\", p. 783; Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 4\u20135. Together these various accounts suggest that Edward's mother was probably a noblewoman named \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, surnamed Candida or Eneda\u2014\"the White\" or \"White Duck\".Higham, Death of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 6.", "The rise of Edward's cult has been interpreted in various ways. It is sometimes portrayed as a popular movement, or as the product of a political attack on King \u00c6thelred by former supporters of Edward. Alternatively, \u00c6thelred has been seen as one of the key forces in the promotion of Edward's cult and that of their sister Eadgifu (Edith of Wilton). He was thought to make the charter in 1001 granting land to Shaftesbury at the elevation of Edward's relics, and some accounts suggest that \u00c6thelred legislated the observation of Edward's feast days across England in a law code of 1008. It is unclear whether this innovation, seemingly drafted by Archbishop Wulfstan II, dates from \u00c6thelred's reign.  It may instead have been promulgated by King Cnut. David Rollason has drawn attention to the increased importance of the cults of other murdered royal saints in this period. Among these are the cults of King Ecgberht of Kent's nephews, whose lives form part of the Mildrith Legend, and those of the Mercian Saints Kenelm and Wigstan.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 14\u201317; Rollason, Mildrith Legend, pp. 53\u201357; Hart, \"Edward\", p. 785; Miller, \"Edward the Martyr\"; Ridyard, Royal Saints, pp. 154\u2013175."]}, {"page": "Edgar the Peaceful", "response": ["*Edith of Wilton also known as Saint Edith.", "Edgar died on 8 July 975 at Winchester, Hampshire.
