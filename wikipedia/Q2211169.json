He was a pioneer in the Fleet Air Arm and fought in the Second World War in a cruiser taking part in the Atlantic convoys, participating in the Norwegian campaign and transporting arms around the Cape of Good Hope to Egypt for use in the western desert campaign. His war service continued as Director-General of Naval Aircraft Production, as naval air attach\u00e9 at the British embassy in Washington D.C. and then as Commanding Officer of two aircraft carriers. He went on to serve as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in the early 1960s. In that capacity he was primarily concerned with plans for the building of the new CVA-01 aircraft-carriers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Polaris Sales Agreement", "response": ["With the Nassau Agreement in hand, it remained to work out the details. Vice Admiral Michael Le Fanu had a meeting with the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, on 21 December 1962, the final day of the Nassau conference. He found McNamara eager to help, and enthusiastic about the idea of Polaris costing as little as possible. The first issue identified was how many Polaris boats should be built. While the Vulcans to carry Skybolt were already in service, the submarines to carry Polaris were not, and there was no provision in the defence budget for them. Some naval officers feared that their construction would adversely impact the hunter-killer submarine programme. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Caspar John, denounced the \"millstone of Polaris hung around our necks\" as \"potential wreckers of the real navy\"."]}, {"page": "Fleet Air Arm", "response": ["* Admiral of the Fleet Sir Caspar John (1903\u20131984): First Sea Lord 1960\u201363 and the first British naval aviator to reach the highest rank within the RN."]}, {"page": "Augustus John", "response": ["Early in 1901, John married Ida Nettleship (1877\u20131907), daughter of the artist John Trivett Nettleship, and a fellow student at the Slade; the couple had five sons.
