She has a Ph.D. from the University of Strathclyde (2006), her thesis title being \"Mechanisms of the themed environment\".The British Council's \"Creative Economy\" website states that:\n\nHer work addresses the mechanisms behind the production of space with particular focus on spatial praxis. This focus is manifested through visual and word-based critiques against normative intellectual and pedagogical tendencies and through direct spatial interventions, which sometimes take activist dimensions.\nSchneider was a founder member of the architectural co-operative Glasgow Letters on Architecture and Space (GLAS, 2000-2007), and also the Sheffield-based AGENCY \u2013 Transformative Research into Architectural Practice and Education in 2007 and the Radical Architectures Network in 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Schneider (surname)", "response": ["*Tatjana Schneider, British architect and academic"]}]}}
