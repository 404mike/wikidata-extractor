He achieved success from 1891, performing cockney songs including \"Arf a Pint of Ale\", \"It's a Great Big Shame\", \"Down the Road\" and \"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses in Between\" in a career lasting over thirty years.\nBorn in Pimlico, London, Elen had worked as a barman and a draper's assistant and had packed eggs for the Co-op before becoming a singer. He began busking at an early age and found a position singing in a minstrel troupe. His solo success began in 1891 when he started performing in public houses, singing songs in a manner similar to many cockney fruit sellers of the time, known as costermongers - from the old word 'costard' , meaning apple. Because of this, he became known as a \"coster comedian\". For the stage persona he had created, Elen dressed in a coster uniform of striped jersey, peaked cap turned towards one ear and a short clay pipe in the side of his mouth. His characters adopted a persona of being constantly bad tempered and pugnacious. In 1907 he starred in a short film called Wait Till the Work Comes Round.\nIn his later years, Elen went to America during the English music hall strike. He performed the same act as he did in the UK, but box-office sales show that he was less successful than his friend, the singer Albert Chevalier, and so he returned to the UK.  He then made several appearances as a top attraction in music halls across London. He appeared on stage occasionally in the 1930s, albeit briefly, and he appeared in the 1935 Royal Command Performance. He retired in 1914, shortly after returning from America. He made occasional appearances on stage and film before his death in 1940 aged 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1940 in music", "response": ["*February 17 \u2013 Gus Elen, music hall singer, 77"]}, {"page": "1899 in music", "response": ["* \"Down The Road\" (w.m.

Cunningham, Leisure in the Industrial Revolution c. 1780-c. 1880 (London: Taylor and Francis, 1980), pp. 164-70. The new urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and accessible means of entertainment. Music halls were originally bars, which provided entertainment in the form of music and speciality acts for their patrons. By the middle years of the 19th century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap. By the turn of the century, music hall was dominated by song writing companies and theatre chains, such as that of Sir Oswald Stoll.M. R. Booth and J. H. Kaplan, ed., The Edwardian Theatre Essays on Performance and the Stage (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 62.  Music hall songs are characterised by a simple beat and a strong melody or tune, which can be easily acquired by the audience. Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone and a repeated chorus, which carries the principal melody and in which the audience is encouraged to join. Leading music hall stars included: Marie Lloyd, Harry Champion, George Formby, Vesta Tilley, Gus Elen, Little Tich, Gracie Fields and Flanagan and Allen. Musical hall composers included Lionel Monckton, Felix Powell and Noel Gay."]}, {"page": "Costermonger", "response": ["From the 18th through to the early 20th-century, music hall entertainers, songwriters and musicians mined the coster culture and language, seeking inspiration for parodies, sketches and songs. Alfred Peck Vance (1838\u20131888), also known as The Vance, was one of the first to exploit the coster image in the music halls.Ian Peddie, \"Playing at Poverty: The Music Hall and the Staging of the Working Class,\" Chapter 12 in Aruna Krishnamurthy (ed), The Working-Class Intellectual in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain, Ashgate Publishing, 2009 Arthur Lloyd was a composer and singer, who achieved great success with his character-songs in the 1870s, many of which were devoted to the lives of costermongers. Lloyd's repertoire, which included songs such as The Costermonger's Song, unlike other music hall compositions, was less dependent on the ability of the performer to mimic Cockney accents and mannerisms, but rather relied on the lyrics to deliver a \"quaintness of fancy\" and humour.Matthews, W., \"Cockney in the Music Halls,\" Chapter 5 in Cockney Past and Present: A Short History of the Dialect of London, Routledge, 2015 Other musicians, such as Robert and Harris Weston, drew inspiration from London's cockney culture when composing their songs, some of which were often sung in a cockney accent. Coster life and culture was also portrayed in Victorian music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood, Charles Seel, Paul Mill and Gus Elen. Elen was a highly popular performer whose tunes included; The Coster's Mansion, The Coster's Muvver and The Coster's Pony. Chevalier, was a popular comedic entertainer, who himself never worked as a coster, but appeared in character as a costermonger, and sang The Coster's Serenade, The Nasty Way 'e Sez It, and Funny Without Being Vulgar. A few costermongers, such as Alec Hurley, made a living composing and performing songs about their own careers as costermongers. The Costermonger's Song (also known as Going to the Derby) was a Lloyd composition. Hurley's wife, Marie Lloyd, had some success with tunes he composed including, The Coster's Christening and the Costermonger's Wedding.Who's Who in the Theatre, Pitman, London, 1912, <Online: https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_qyk_AQAAMAAJ", "File:Gus Elen If It Wasnt for the Ouses In Between.jpg|Cover of Gus Elen's If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between also known as The Cockney's Garden", "File:1899 Gus Ellen.jpg|Cover of Gus Elen's The Coster's Mansion, 1899"]}, {"page": "Hackney Marshes", "response": ["*The celebrated cockney music hall performer Gus Elen sang a song entitled If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between which included the following chorus:"]}, {"page": "Albert Chevalier", "response": ["Upon his return from America and Canada in 1896, Chevalier decided to reduce his music hall appearances owing to the unpredictability and inattentiveness of the genre's audiences, which he came to dislike. From the paying public's point of view, his style of humour had become common place within the music hall.  His biggest rival was Gus Elen who had developed a more complex and comical alternative to Chevalier's. Instead, Chevalier decided to concentrate his time on creating comic characters which he used in one-man sketches which he called his \"recitals\". To keep within the audiences gaze, he still performed occasional coster songs and performed them alongside his characterisations.  The characters included a country vicar in \"Our Bazaar\", a struggling actor in \"A Fallen Star\", and a west-country peasant in \"E Can't Take a Roise out of oi\". While none of these pieces earned the kind of success that his coster songs had achieved, Chevalier maintained a successful solo career performing them.
