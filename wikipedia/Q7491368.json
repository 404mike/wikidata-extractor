Cope biographer Mick Houghton said that most of the album was recorded at the in-house studios of Island Records. Nonetheless, Skinner exempted himself from co-producing four of the album's songs while he worked with other musicians, and during this period, Cope, Cosby and Deutsch reconvened to the cheap, 16-track machine-equipped South London recording studio belonging to Shawn Harvey, in order for Cope to visit his wife at the nearby King's College Hospital as they awaited their first child. In Harvey's studio, they recorded on second-hand tape. According to Cope, the \"results were certainly more sonically imbalanced and experimental\" than anything he had previously achieved."]}, {"page": "Shawn Harvey", "response": ["Shawn Harvey may refer to:", "* Shawn Harvey (singer-songwriter)", "* Shawn Harvey (basketball)"]}]}}
