By the beginning of the 1974\u201375 season, Chivers was considered to be the senior forward at Tottenham, playing alongside Chris Jones, Chris McGrath and Scotsman John Duncan. In early September, he played his last game for the legendary Bill Nicholson, as Middlesbrough crushed Spurs 4\u20130 in the 2nd round of the League Cup. Injuries restricted Chivers to just 28 league appearances in which he scored 10 goals, including important strikes against West Ham United, Leeds United and local rivals Arsenal."]}, {"page": "1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)", "response": ["* Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 British Home Championship", "response": ["* Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1974 UEFA Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||7 || Chris McGrath  ", "|FW ||7 || Chris McGrath  "]}, {"page": "List of South China AA footballers", "response": ["*  Chris McGrath (\u9ea5\u683c\u592b) (1983\u201385)"]}, {"page": "Chris McGrath", "response": ["Chris McGrath may refer to:", "* Chris McGrath (footballer) (Christopher Roland McGrath, born 1954), Northern Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Chris McGrath"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Chris McGrath"]}]}}
