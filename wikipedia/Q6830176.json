The first reported plumbylene, [((CH3)3Si)2CH]2Pb, was synthesized by Michael F. Lappert et al by transmetallation of PbCl2 with [((CH3)3Si)2CH]Li. The addition of equimolar RLi to PbX2 produces the monohalogenated plumbylene (RPbX); addition of 2 equivalents leads to disubstituted plumbylene (R2Pb). Adding an organolithium or Grignard reagent with a different organic substituent (i.e. R\u2019Li/R\u2019MgX) from RPbX leads to the synthesis of heteroleptic plumbylenes (RR\u2019Pb). Dialkyl-, diaryl-, diamido-, dithioplumbylenes, and monohalogenated plumbyelenes have been successfully synthesized this way."]}]}}
