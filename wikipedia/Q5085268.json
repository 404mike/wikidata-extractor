The starting goalkeeper, Leigh Richmond Roose, was forced off with injury in the opening 15 minutes, leading to defender Charlie Morris taking over in his absence. At half-time, England agreed that Dai Davies, who was in the crowd for the game, could enter the game to replace Roose. A final defeat against Ireland resulted in Wales finishing bottom of the championship table one year after winning the tournament outright. Ted Robbins was appointed FAW secretary in 1909, while one of Wales' most prominent players of the era, goalkeeper Roose, entered a steady decline. Although considered \"one of the greatest players of his generation\", Roose had developed a reputation for eccentricity that began to prove costly at times. In March 1910, Wales suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to Scotland when Roose allowed a speculative shot into the net having had his back turned towards play, talking to a spectator. In November of the same year, Roose suffered a broken arm while playing for his club side but declared himself fit for the British Home Championship internationals in March 1911. A poor performance in a 2\u20132 draw with Scotland ultimately ended his international career as he was never selected for Wales again."]}]}}
