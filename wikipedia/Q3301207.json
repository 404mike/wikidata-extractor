Sympathizers regard him as a charismatic master who brought new knowledge into Western culture, a psychology and cosmology that enable insights beyond those provided by established science.

Along with Orage he attended Ouspensky's 1921 London talks where he met Gurdjieff. With his wife Catherine and their daughter, he spent almost a year at Gurdjieff's Prieur\u00e9 institute. A year later, when they returned to London, Nicoll rejoined Ouspensky's group. In 1931, on Ouspensky's advice he started his own Fourth Way groups in England. He is best known for the encyclopedic six-volume series of articles in Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky (Boston: Shambhala, 1996, and Samuel Weiser Inc., 1996).", "Gurdjieff's views were initially promoted through the writings of his pupils. The best known and widely read of these is P. D. Ouspensky's In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching, which is widely regarded as a crucial introduction to the teaching. Others refer to Gurdjieff's own books (detailed below) as the primary texts. Numerous anecdotal accounts of time spent with Gurdjieff were published by Charles Stanley Nott, Thomas and Olga de Hartmann, Fritz Peters, Ren\u00e9 Daumal, John G.

The earliest was by James Jackson Putnam, who used it as the name of his electroconvulsive therapy. The term was also used by C. G. Jung and A. R. Orage, who were both far closer to Assagioli's thinking than Putnam. C. G. Jung had written, comparing his goals to those of Sigmund Freud, \"If there is a 'psychoanalysis' there must also be a 'psychosynthesis which creates future events according to the same laws'.\"Jung quoted in J. Kerr, A Dangerous Method (2012) pp. 214-5. A. R. Orage, who was the publisher of the influential The New Age journal, also made use of the term, which he hyphenated as psycho-synthesis. Orage formed an early psychology study group (which included Maurice Nicoll who later studied with Carl Jung) and concluded that what humanity needed was not psychoanalysis, but psycho-synthesis.A. R. Orage: On Love/Psychological Exercises: With Some Aphorisms & Other Essays, p.126  The term was also employed by Bezzoli.Roberto Assagioli - his life and work  A biography from Kentaur Institute in Denmark Freud, however, was opposed to what he saw as the directive element in Jung's approach to psychosynthesis,J. Kerr, A Dangerous Method (2012) p. 489. and argued for a spontaneous synthesis on the patient's part: \"As we analyse...the great unity which we call his ego fits into itself all the instinctual impulses which before had been split off and held apart from it. The psycho-synthesis is thus achieved in analytic treatment without our intervention, automatically and inevitably.\"Sigmund Freud, \"Lines of Advance in Psycho-Analytic Therapy\" [1918] in Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2003) p. 110."]}, {"page": "J.
