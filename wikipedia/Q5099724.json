Their father was Alfred Coulson (who became Principal of Dudley Technical College) and their mother was Annie Sincere Hancock, a school headmistress.He went to Clifton College. He did his first degree at Christ's College, Cambridge, then a postgraduate course in Chemical Engineering at Imperial College followed by research, achieving a PhD in 1935.  He joined the academic staff, achieving the status of Reader.  In 1954 he became the first head of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Newcastle University, where he remained until his retirement in 1975, apart from a secondment to Heriot-Watt University during its formation of a separate department of chemical engineering.Coulson married twice, first to Dora (died 1961) with whom he had two sons, Anthony and Simon, and then in 1965 to Christine, who survived him.He was awarded the George E. Davis Medal of the Institution of Chemical Engineers in 1973,  and he received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in the same year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chemical engineers", "response": ["|John Coulson (1910\u20131990)||Co-author of what became the standard UK textbook set; Coulson & Richardson's Chemical Engineering||Newcastle University, UK"]}, {"page": "Coulson", "response": ["*John Coulson (1910\u20131990), British professor of chemical engineering", "*Sir John Coulson (diplomat) (1909\u20131997), British ambassador to Sweden and secretary-general of EFTA"]}, {"page": "Institution of Chemical Engineers", "response": ["* John Coulson (1910\u20131990) Co-writer of classic UK textbooks"]}, {"page": "Jack Richardson (chemical engineer)", "response": ["He co-wrote a textbook on chemical engineering with John Coulson (published in 1954), which developed into an established series of six texts now known as Coulson & Richardson's Chemical Engineering.
