Innerd found it hard to break into the Newcastle side, which was the pre-eminent team of the era, and played mainly for the reserve team, Newcastle United 'A's. He made only three appearances in the first team, two in 1901 and a final appearance in 1905. At the end of the 1905 season Innerd signed for Crystal Palace and took over as captain from Ted Birnie in 1906. He captained the club during their shock FA Cup win over Newcastle in 1907. Innerd was a regular in the side until he was badly injured in a January 1909 FA Cup match against Wolverhampton Wanderers which curtailed his Palace career.", "link_mentions": {}}}
