Innerd found it hard to break into the Newcastle side, which was the pre-eminent team of the era, and played mainly for the reserve team, Newcastle United 'A's. He made only three appearances in the first team, two in 1901 and a final appearance in 1905. At the end of the 1905 season Innerd signed for Crystal Palace and took over as captain from Ted Birnie in 1906. He captained the club during their shock FA Cup win over Newcastle in 1907. Innerd was a regular in the side until he was badly injured in a January 1909 FA Cup match against Wolverhampton Wanderers which curtailed his Palace career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Crystal Palace F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Wilf Innerd ||||CB||1905\u20131909||133||7|| style=\"background:#3f9;\"|1906\u20131909||"]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Chelsea F.C. season", "response": ["Chelsea registered their third consecutive league win against former First Division side and Second Division champions several years prior, Burnley at Stamford Bridge on 18 November, the narrow 1\u20130 victory courtesy of a McRoberts goal in the 70th minute. However, due to a scheduling conflict, Chelsea crashed out of the FA Cup in the Third Qualifying Round after they were forced to play Southern League Division Two side Crystal Palace in another cup derby at the FA Cup Final venue, the Crystal Palace Park in Penge, Kent just outside of London on the same day as the league match with Burnley, with Jacky Robertson prioritising the league match, he fielded a mostly amateur reserve side in the cup, losing 7\u20131. Wilf Innerd opened the scoring for Palace, getting an early brace, followed by two goals from Mart Watkins, whose second was a penalty, to make it 4. Archie Needham and Dick Harker then added a 5th and 6th respectively, with Watkins completing his hat-trick to make it 7. Chelsea did at least manage a late consolation goal through O'Hara. To add to the Pensioners' humiliation, to this day, this defeat is the largest win a non-league side has ever registered against league opposition in the FA Cup. Chelsea wrapped up the month with a 0\u20130 draw against newly elected Leeds City at Elland Road on 25 November. Despite Chelsea's unfortunate FA Cup exit, the Blues went undefeated in the league in November, winning 3 and drawing 1 without conceding a goal, taking them back up to 3rd place and back into contention for promotion."]}, {"page": "Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C.

Palace were still playing in the claret and blue kit handed down from Aston Villa, paired with white shorts. The Magpies fielded a side featuring ten internationals, whilst Palace could count only four players who had tasted the Football League. The Glaziers captain Wilf Innerd had been on the books for Newcastle United, but had only made three appearances for the club, and Bill Forster and Archie Needham had managed twenty appearances between them for Sheffield United. The Palace team had been drawn predominately from the North of players who struggled to get into their home teams by former Middlesbrough manager Jack Robson.

There were a number of personnel changes this season, with Archie Grant and captain Ted Birnie moving to Chelsea and George Walker going to New Brompton. Palace's hat-trick hero in their FA Cup exploits of last season, Walter Watkins, also moved on to Northampton Town. In their places Palace brought in a number of new faces.  Charles Ryan joined from Nunhead, Thomas Wills from Newcastle, Bill Forster from Sheffield United and Bill Ledger from Pryhope Villa.  Wilf Innerd was made captain and played in all but one of the club's League and Cup matches. The club struggled to find their feet on the new division, and failed to score in 13 of their matches, finishing the season in 19th position, one place off the bottom.  This was enough to ensure safety though, as for this season there was no relegation. Palace again called on a number of amateurs from the local area and beyond, including Henry Littlewort.
