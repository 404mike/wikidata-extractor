He was a prominent figure in the Labour Party in North East England, such that he was nicknamed \"Mr Newcastle\".Smith sought to clear Newcastle of slum housing under government directive and put a great deal of effort into regeneration plans, suggesting that the city should become \"The Brasilia of the North\". He also supported the expansion of higher education in Newcastle and funded local arts institutions. Among the developments in which Smith's council participated were the Newcastle Civic Centre and Swan House. The last led to the demolition of John Dobson's Royal Arcade, though Smith's council had it carefully dismantled and planned to rebuild it nearby. The succeeding council decided not to rebuild it.  Smith's legacy became associated with the destruction of historic buildings in favour of unpopular concrete structures, despite the key developments happening mainly under other council leaders.\nAfter leaving the council leadership, Smith ran a public relations firm and formed business links with architect John Poulson. This led to his trial for accepting bribes in April 1974. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. In Smith's later life he campaigned for prisoners' issues and continued to comment on public affairs. He starred in a film of his life released in 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political scandals in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Corrupt architect John Poulson and links to Conservative Home Secretary Reginald Maudling, Labour council leader T.

Dan Smith's ambition to redevelop Newcastle attracted the attention of the construction firm Bovis which had worked for Poulson. Bovis' managing director suggested formalising links and in February 1962 Smith was appointed as a consultant to the Poulson organisation. This connection was extremely valuable to Poulson as Smith had a network of contacts among other authorities in the north-east, many of whom were also recruited as Poulson consultants. Smith's involvement with the Labour Party reassured many Labour councillors wary of dealing with someone involved in the Conservative-allied National Liberals.", "Many of his contacts, in particular T. Dan Smith and George Pottinger, were similarly convicted and gaoled, though not the three MPs: it was found that there was a legal loophole through which members of parliament could not be considered as in charge of public funds. The Poulson scandals did much to force the House of Commons to initiate a Register of Members' Interests.

These would be connected and supported by an improved and largely new road system, giving priority to traffic movement and separating pedestrians onto walkways.  At the same time, the plan sought to conserve historic areas.  However, Burns wrote that \"the city centre must cater to the maximum extent possible for car traffic\".
