He was a prominent figure in the Labour Party in North East England, such that he was nicknamed \"Mr Newcastle\".Smith sought to clear Newcastle of slum housing under government directive and put a great deal of effort into regeneration plans, suggesting that the city should become \"The Brasilia of the North\". He also supported the expansion of higher education in Newcastle and funded local arts institutions. Among the developments in which Smith's council participated were the Newcastle Civic Centre and Swan House. The last led to the demolition of John Dobson's Royal Arcade, though Smith's council had it carefully dismantled and planned to rebuild it nearby. The succeeding council decided not to rebuild it.  Smith's legacy became associated with the destruction of historic buildings in favour of unpopular concrete structures, despite the key developments happening mainly under other council leaders.\nAfter leaving the council leadership, Smith ran a public relations firm and formed business links with architect John Poulson. This led to his trial for accepting bribes in April 1974. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. In Smith's later life he campaigned for prisoners' issues and continued to comment on public affairs. He starred in a film of his life released in 1987.", "link_mentions": {}}}
