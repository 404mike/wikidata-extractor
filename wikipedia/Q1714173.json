John le Carr\u00e9 asked to be removed from consideration, saying he was \"flattered\", but that he does not compete for literary prizes. However, judge Dr Rick Gekoski said although he was disappointed that le Carr\u00e9 wanted to withdraw, his name would remain on the list. American novelist Roth was announced as the winner on 18 May 2011 at the Sydney Writers' Festival. Of his win, Roth said \"This is a great honour and I'm delighted to receive it.\" The writer said he hoped the prize would bring him to the attention of readers around the world who are not currently familiar with his body of work. Roth received his award in London on 28 June; however, he was unable to attend in person due to ill health, so he sent a short video instead. After Roth was announced as the winner, Carmen Callil withdrew from the judging panel, saying \"I don't rate him as a writer at all... in 20 years' time will anyone read him?\" Callil later wrote an editorial in The Guardian explaining her position and why she chose to leave the panel."]}, {"page": "Carmen Callil", "response": ["She was a member of the committee for the Booker Prize, 1979\u201384; a founder director of the Groucho Club, London, 1984\u201394, and in 1989 received the Distinguished Service Award from the International Women's Writing Guild.

The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg's philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden (\"poets and heroes\"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: \"He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing.\" The novelist felt that Cruise's portrayal was more akin to one as a \"troublesome cop\".
