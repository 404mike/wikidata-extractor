Experimenters rapidly trigger the folding of a sample of unfolded protein and observe the resulting dynamics. Fast techniques in use include neutron scattering, ultrafast mixing of solutions, photochemical methods, and laser temperature jump spectroscopy. Among the many scientists who have contributed to the development of these techniques are Jeremy Cook, Heinrich Roder, Harry Gray, Martin Gruebele, Brian Dyer, William Eaton, Sheena Radford, Chris Dobson, Alan Fersht, Bengt N\u00f6lting and Lars Konermann."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Alan Fersht (born 1943), British chemist and biochemist, expert on enzymes and protein folding"]}, {"page": "List of biochemists", "response": ["* Alan Fersht FRS (b. 1943).
