Over the years, his research has focused primarily on the subjects of population regulation, predator\u2013prey dynamics, and biological control. He has also contributed extensively to understanding the scientific and socioeconomic ramifications caused by human overpopulation and environmental degradation.  He was the recipient of the 1990 Robert H. MacArthur Award granted by the Ecological Society of America. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the Ecological Society of America (ESA).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of California, Santa Barbara", "response": ["*William W.
