He signed amateur forms with Cardiff City in 1942, becoming a professional when league football resumed after the war. Part of the Cardiff side which won promotion from Division Three (South) in 1946\u201347, he signed for Second Division Manchester City in May 1947, Cardiff receiving \u00a312,000 for the player. Manchester City had just secured promotion with matches to spare, resulting in Clarke achieving an unusual feat of playing in three different divisions in consecutive matches.\nClarke was a Manchester City regular for the next decade, making 349 league appearances. He was part of the Manchester City team which reached consecutive FA Cup finals in the 1950s, winning in 1956. In 1958 Clarke moved to Stockport County, and later had a spell as manager of Northwich Victoria. After retiring from football he ran a sports shop, and subsequently returned to Manchester City, where he ran the social club for nearly 25 years. He died in 2006, after a long illness with Alzheimer's disease.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester City F.C.", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Roy Clarke"]}, {"page": "2006 in Wales", "response": ["*13 March - Roy Clarke, footballer, 80"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2006", "response": ["*Roy Clarke, 80, Welsh footballer for Manchester City & Wales."]}, {"page": "2006 in association football", "response": ["*March 13 \u2013 Roy Clarke (80), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "March 2006 in sports", "response": ["*13: Roy Clarke"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Roy Clarke ||  || Winger || 1947\u20131958 || 370 || 79 || ||", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Roy Clarke || left winger || player || 1947\u20131958"]}]}}
