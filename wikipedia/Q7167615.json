It was at Bawdsey Manor that she knew of Harry Thrower, the father of Percy Thrower, as he was a gardener there, it being his first gardening position.  When Maude wanted a head gardener at Horwood House, she recruited Harry and he remained there for the rest of his life."]}, {"page": "De Vere Horwood Estate", "response": ["Horwood House was the birthplace of Percy Thrower (born 30 January 1913) whose father Harry Thrower (born 1882 in Felixstowe) was the head gardener when the house was built. There was a gardening staff of sixteen, and the position of head gardener came with a six-roomed cottage next to the vegetable garden, which was about  and enclosed by a  brick wall. The wage for the head gardener was \u00a32 per week, plus the cottage, heating, free fruit and vegetables, free milk and miscellaneous perks. The wages for an ordinary gardener were 28 shillings per week. There were lean-to greenhouses heated by a coal boiler via water pipes. There was an extensive apple orchard of nearly two hundred trees, which was able to provide apples all year apart from a few summer weeks. The head gardener was also required to provide exotic fruits at the time, such as peaches, melons, grapes etc. He was also required to produce mushrooms. The beehives were also the responsibility of Harry. When Percy was born in the cottage he was the first child to be born at Horwood House. Harry was previously a gardener at Bawdsey Manor, which was Maude Denny's family home. Percy started work as a \u201cpot-and-crock\u201d boy at Horwood in the Spring of 1927, even though the house didn\u2019t really need one, but it never occurred to either Frederick Denny or Harry Thrower not to employ him.  In fact all Percy's siblings were employed on the estate at the start of their working life.  Percy received a shilling (5p) for an 11-hour day and worked a five-and-a-half-day week.  He was able to supplement his income by catching wildlife; the estate paid 6d  each for moles, magpies and carrion crows, and sometimes he would earn more from this than his wages. Percy left Horwood in 1931 to work in the royal gardens at Windsor, where there was a staff of sixty gardeners.  Mrs Denny was so impressed that he was going to work at Windsor that she instructed one of the chauffeurs to drive Percy and his father there. By 1931 the number of gardeners at Horwood had been reduced from nineteen to seven, and Harry struggled to keep the garden up to scratch. Whilst BT had Horwood House, as their management college, the number was down to two, but they had the advantage of mechanisation. Harry Thrower died suddenly on 31 December 1939, when he was 57, from haemorrhage of the lungs brought on by smoking an ounce of pipe tobacco a day, and the effort of keeping the gardens up to standard with the three remaining gardeners.  He was buried at St Nicholas' church in Little Horwood, with the inscription on his tombstone of \u201cHighly valued friend and head gardener for many years to Mr. & Mrs. Denny of Horwood House\u201d. Mrs. Harry Thrower was left a widow for 35 years. At first she worked in the house as a housekeeper, but later she ran a shop in Little Horwood, only retiring in 1971 because she refused to adopt decimalisation.  She died in 1974.", "During World War II a girls' school from the Isle of Wight was evacuated to Horwood House, and the Dennys moved out to The Laundry in Little Horwood, which, despite the name, was almost like a small mansion.
