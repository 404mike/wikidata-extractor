Their publication, Nationalism Today, featured positive articles on the Libyan and Iranian governments, presenting them as part of a global anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist third force. This may have had tactical as well as ideological motivations, with Libya and Iran viewed as potential sources of funding. This new ideology alienated many NF members. The Official NF experienced internal problems and in 1989 Griffin, Derek Holland and Colin Todd split from it to establish the International Third Position. In March 1990 the Official NF was disbanded by its leaders, Patrick Harrington, Graham Williamson and David Kerr, who replaced it with a new organisation, the Third Way. This left the Flag Group as the only party using the National Front banner."]}, {"page": "Third Way (UK organisation)", "response": ["In 1999, new electoral organisation the National Liberal Party was formed by Patrick Harrington and Graham Williamson and registered as National Liberal Party \u2013 The Third Way with the Electoral Commission.

The ONF had opened dialogue with groups like the Nation of Islam and the Pan-Afrikan International Movement. According to Harrington's account of the split, when he opened discussion with Jewish nationalist and anti-Zionist rabbi Mayer Schiller (see section on Harrington's ideological development below) and advocated a two-state solution to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, he was attacked as a \"Zionist\". Harrington and Williamson attended pro-Palestinian demonstrations such as the 1988 Quds Day march in London, as part of an ONF strategy to show support for Muslim anti-Zionists.Cheles, Ferguson & Vaughan, Neo-Fascism in Europe p.260", "*Taking Liberties \u2013 A Third Way Special on Attacks on Civil Liberties in the UK (with Nick Griffin, Graham Williamson, Tim Bragg and David Kerr) ()"]}]}}
