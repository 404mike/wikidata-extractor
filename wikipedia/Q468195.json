He was one of the seven founding saints of Brittany.\nMalo was baptized as an adult by Brendan the Navigator and became his student. As a monk at Llancarfan Abbey in Wales, Malo was known for his participation in the Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot. As an immigrant to Brittany, he helped in the missionary work of Aaron of Brittany, was the first bishop of Aleth (modern Saint-Servan, France) and established churches in the area of Brittany now named Saint-Malo in his honor. Malo was later driven from the area to Saintes, France by opponents of his mission.\nDetails of Malo's career have been preserved in three medieval 'Lives' that seem to include incidents associated with multiple people bearing a similar name. It appears that Malo was probably born in Wales in approximately 520.\nMalo's name may derive from the Old Breton machlou, a compound of mach \"warrant, hostage\" and lou (or loh) \"brilliant, bright, beautiful\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
