This result qualified him for the Challenge Tour where he won for the first time in 2010 at the Scottish Hydro Challenge. The win helped him to a top ten end of season ranking which earned him a place on the European Tour for 2011.\nOn 4 October 2011, Murray finished third in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews, Scotland - his highest finish on the European Tour. The Scotsman said after a fog delay on the third day, a young fan asked for his autograph - for the first time ever. Murray later said it was the young fan that inspired to play well as he enjoyed feeling the success.After a poor 2012 season, Murray lost his playing rights and failed to regain his card at qualifying school by one shot after making a double bogey at the last hole.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Murray", "response": ["George Murray may refer to:", "*George Murray (musician), bass guitarist", "*George Murray (poet) (born 1971), Canadian poet", "*Lord George Murray (general) (1694\u20131760), Jacobite general", "*George Murray (Royal Navy officer, born 1741) (1741\u20131797), Royal Navy officer and MP for Perth Burghs", "*George Murray (Royal Navy officer, born 1759) (1759\u20131819), Royal Navy admiral", "*George Murray (British Army officer) (1772\u20131846), Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada", "*George Murray, 5th Earl of Dunmore (1762\u20131836), Scottish politician and peer", "*George Murray (Nova Scotia politician) (1828\u20131888), physician and politician in Nova Scotia, Canada", "*Lord George Murray (bishop) (1761\u20131803), bishop of St David's, grandson of the general", "*George Murray (bishop of Rochester) (1784\u20131860), bishop of Sodor and Man, 1814\u20131827, and Rochester, 1827\u20131860, son of the bishop of St David's", "*George Murray (baseball) (1898\u20131955), former pitcher, nicknamed \"Smiler\"", "*George Murray (cricketer) (born 1940), Australian cricketer", "*George Murray (footballer) (born 1942), Scottish footballer", "*George Murray (golfer) (born 1983), Scottish professional golfer", "*George Murray (rugby union), Scottish rugby player", "*George Murray, 6th Duke of Atholl (1814\u20131864), Scottish peer who formed the Atholl Highlanders", "*Sir George Murray (civil servant) (1849\u20131936), British civil servant", "*George Murray, a character in Actor's and Sin"]}, {"page": "Alfred Dunhill Championship", "response": ["|style=\"background:lightblue\"|13th || 2011 || AFR, EUR ||  Garth Mulroy || align=\"center\" |269 || align=center|\u221219 || 2 strokes ||  George Murray || Leopard Creek"]}, {"page": "Richie Ramsay", "response": ["| Stephan Gross Jr. (a),  George Murray"]}, {"page": "Scottish Challenge", "response": ["| 2010 ||  George Murray || align=center|267 || align=center|\u221217 || 4 strokes ||  Magnus A.
