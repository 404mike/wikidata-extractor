Edwards (1933\u20132000) was a Scottish painter.\nEdwards trained at Gray's School of Art, in Aberdeen, from 1950 to 1954, under Robert Sivell, then head of the school. After completing National Service he married Betty, who had also studied at Gray's, and moved to Home Farm, Kingswells, just outside Aberdeen.\nHe regularly exhibited his work at the Royal Scottish Academy throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He worked in both oils and tempera.\nHis work was inspired by his rural surroundings, and he was concerned with representing the human aspect of farming life. His love of the turn of seasons and the ever changing rural landscape is clear in his work. The rhythmic nature of the paintings evoke the cycle of nature itself. Some of his larger works depicting agricultural themes, can be seen at National Museum of Rural Life, Kittochside, East Kilbride. If the paintings are not on exhibition you can request to view them in the store.\nHe was also an accomplished portrait painter and was latterly working on a large painting of a group of Aberdeen Artists - unfortunately this work was not completed.\nEdwards has over 40 paintings in public art collections, particularly the National Museum of Rural Life (Scotland) and Aberdeenshire Museums Service.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Edwards", "response": ["Joseph or Joe Edwards may refer to:", "* Joe Edwards (singer/bass player), frontman of The Rascals", "* Joe Edwards (painter) (1933\u20132000), Scottish painter", "* Joe Edwards (comics) (1921\u20132007), cartoonist of Lil Jinx in Archie Comics", "* Joe Edwards (St. Louis), businessman and community figure from St. Louis, Missouri", "* Joe Edwards (footballer, born 1990), English professional footballer", "* Joe Edwards (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u20131997), English footballer", "* Joe Edwards (rugby union) (born 1993), New Zealander and Rugby union player", "* Jim Joe Edwards (1894\u20131965), Major League Baseball pitcher"]}, {"page": "Robert Sivell", "response": ["In the 1930s Sivell moved to Aberdeen to teach at Grays School of Art, serving as Head of Drawing and Painting from 1942 to 1954. His pupils included Joe Edwards, Taylor Bremner, Gordon Stewart Cammeron, and Alberto Morrocco, who built up a large collection of Sivell's work. In 1936 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy (ARSA) and in 1943 a full member (RSA). While at Gray's, he undertook a large-scale painting project consisting of larger-than-life murals in a lecture and exhibition hall within the Aberdeen University Union on Gallowgate. This project involved three of his pupils (Albert Morrocco, Taylor Bremner, and James Hillocks) in an effort that began in 1938 and continued until his retirement in 1953, being interrupted by World War II. During the war Sivell completed a number of short-term commissions for the War Artists Advisory Committee. Among these was one of a Scottish policeman and two of women who had both been awarded the George Medal. During his years of teaching, Sivell continued to paint commissioned portraits and subjects of his own choosing, and to exhibit in galleries and exhibitions."]}]}}
