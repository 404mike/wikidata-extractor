Brooks was a left-handed batsman who bowled left-arm fast-medium. The son of William James Brooks and Mabel Brooks, he was born at Marylebone, London.\nPrior to appearing in first-class cricket, Wilson had played Second XI cricket for Middlesex, and on one notable occasion he bowled the Australian Don Bradman in a practice session at Lord's before the 1938 season began, making him a celebrity for a short time. The following year he made what was to be his only first-class appearance for Middlesex against Warwickshire in the County Championship at Lord's. This was the final first-class match played by Middlesex that season, and Brooks was drafted into the team after a number of regular players had been drafted into the armed services due to rising tensions with Germany. In a match which Middlesex won by an innings and 200 runs, Brooks batted once, scoring an unbeaten 44.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brooks (surname)", "response": ["*Paul Brooks (born 1959), British film producer", "*Paul Brooks (author) (1909\u20131998), American nature writer and editor", "*Paul Brooks (cricketer) (1921\u20131946), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "National Fire Service", "response": ["*Paul Brooks, cricketer (served in London and Coventry)"]}, {"page": "Paul Brooks", "response": ["Paul Brooks is a British-born film producer."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Paul Brooks"]}]}}
