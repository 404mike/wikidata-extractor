In the 1970s and into the 1980s, as the series gained cult status a large amount of fan produced material began to appear, with the official appreciation society forming in 1977. In 1988, the first officially sanctioned guide \u2013 The Prisoner Companion \u2013 was released. It was not well received by fans or Patrick McGoohan. In 1989, Oswald and Carraze released The Prisoner in France with a translated version appearing shortly after. From the 1990s, numerous other books about the TV series and Patrick McGoohan have been produced. Robert Fairclough's books - including two volumes of original scripts - are considered some of the best researched books available. For the 40th anniversary, Andrew Pixley wrote a well-received and in depth account of the series' production. There are guides to shooting locations in Portmeirion and also a biography of co-creator George Markstein. Some members of the production crew have released books about their time working on the series including Eric Mival and Ian Rakoff. Roger Langley the organiser of the Six of One The Prisoner appreciation society has published several books, guides and novels inspired by the TV series (including Patrick McGoohan: Danger Man or Prisoner? first published in 2007 and revised and updated in 2017 with input from Catherine McGoohan)."]}, {"page": "Patrick McGoohan", "response": ["McGoohan received two Emmy Awards for his work on Columbo, with his long-time friend Peter Falk. McGoohan said that his first appearance on Columbo (episode: \"By Dawn's Early Light\", 1974) was probably his favourite American role. He directed five Columbo episodes (including three of the four in which he appeared), one of which he also wrote and two of which he also produced. McGoohan was involved with the Columbo series in some capacity from 1974 to 2000; his daughter Catherine McGoohan appeared with him in his final episode, \"Ashes to Ashes\" (1998).
