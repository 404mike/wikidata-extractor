He was born and died in London.\nNicholl was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. Nicholl's record as a cricketer is sketchy. He opened the innings for Cambridge University in a single match against Marylebone Cricket Club in July 1835, failed to score in either innings and is not recorded as bowling; nor, indeed, is there any record of him playing in any further matches, even minor games.Nicholl graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1836 and became a solicitor in London, practising from an address near the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nicholl", "response": ["* Frederick Nicholl (1814\u20131893), English lawyer and cricketer"]}]}}
