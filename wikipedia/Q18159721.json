He was the eldest of seven children, four of whom also played the harp, most notably his brother Thomas Thomas. John Thomas started off by playing the triple harp, which had three sets of strings and was very difficult to play. At the age of 14, through the influence of Ada Lovelace, (Lord Byron's daughter), he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music in London. His teachers there included Cipriani Potter for composition and John Balsir Chatterton for harp."]}, {"page": "Chatterton (surname)", "response": ["*John Balsir Chatterton, English harpist"]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* John Balsir Chatterton (1804\u20131871)"]}, {"page": "F.

He came from a musical family: his grandfather John Chatterton was 'professor of music' at Portsmouth and who with his wife Mary n\u00e9e Callow had eight sons and three daughters. Earlier in life John Chatterton had inherited and spent a large fortune and not wanting the same thing to happen to his sons decided that at least three of them should become successful harpists. Two, the oldest and youngest - John Balsir Chatterton  and Frederick Chatterton, followed their father's wishes. However, Edward Andrew Chatterton, the second son and  Frederick Balsir Chatterton's father, did not wish to follow his father's plan and instead became, at various times, a music publisher, a seller of musical instruments and a box book-keeper at Sadler's Wells Theatre.  Edward Chatterton wished for a better career for his own son and wanted him to follow the family tradition of harp-playing, but as a young boy growing up and having the run of the Wells, Frederick Balsir Chatterton decided that the stage was the only career for him and persuaded the theatre's manager to give him a small role in a pantomime. This did not go down too well with his uncles who demanded that his father persuade Frederick to withdraw from the production before he dishonoured the family name. On leaving the show he was tutored by William Aspull with the intention of becoming a professor of music. It was as such that he was described when on 13 October 1853 he married Mary Ann n\u00e9e Williams (c1830\u20131909), the daughter of Samuel Williams, a dairyman, at St. George's church in BloomsburyLondon, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-1932 for Frederick Balsir Chatterton: Camden, St George, Bloomsbury - Ancestry.com  and with whom he had at least two daughters and a son."]}, {"page": "Frederick Chatterton", "response": ["Frederick Chatterton was born at Portsmouth in 1812, the son of Mary n\u00e9e Callow (1779-1844) and John Chatterton (1778-), 'professor of music' who with his wife had eight sons and three daughters.
