At some point in the late 1970s, he was admitted to the Mater Hospital for a short stay.  Although he was watched by bodyguards, the Provisional IRA decided to assassinate him, in what they termed \"Operation Bunter\".  However, this was prevented by the police, acting on information received from an informant.In 1983, Joseph Bennett, a UVF commander, became an informant for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). As a result, fourteen prominent members of the UVF were imprisoned, including Graham.Graham was targeted for assassination by the Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO) and on 10 October 1991 an IPLO unit entered the Diamond Jubilee bar on Graham's native Shankill Road and shot a patron dead. However the man they killed was Harry Ward, a 42-year-old Protestant Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member whom they mistook for Graham. On 14 January 1993, Graham was hit by rifle shots, fired through the window of his home. The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) claimed responsibility. The attack led to a number of other leading loyalists turning their homes into miniature fortresses for fear that they too would be targeted.Graham has been named on several occasions as the incumbent UVF Chief of Staff, and as such holding Brigadier-General rank: for example, by Pat Rabbitte, and by campaigner Raymond McCord. Investigative journalist and author Martin Dillon uses the pseudonym \"Mr F.\" to refer to a \"military commander\" in the UVF, who he states was \"known as Bunter\".Ed Moloney in his book Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland stated that he has held the position of UVF Chief of Staff since 1976. Raymond McCord claimed, in a statement to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, that Graham had acted as an \"agent of the state\".In 2000, amid a violent UDA-UVF feud, Graham was involved in talking to hardliners in the UVF and dissuading them from escalating the conflict. Under Graham's influence the UVF members who were feuding with the UDA West Belfast Brigade agreed to a truce negotiated by the group's political representatives David Ervine of the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party and Gary McMichael of the UDA's political arm, the Ulster Democratic Party.In 2012, Graham went on a trip with other veteran loyalists and republicans to the Middle East to study the Arab-Israeli conflict and the lessons it might provide for Northern Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Graham", "response": ["*John Graham (painter) (1754\u20131817), Scottish painter and teacher of art", "*John Graham (producer) (fl. 2000s), British music producer", "*John Graham, Earl of Menteith (died 1346), Scottish soldier", "*John Graham (pirate) (fl. 1683\u20131686), English pirate active off New England", "*John Graham (British Army officer, born 1778) (1778\u20131821), founder of Grahamstown, South Africa", "*John Graham (British Army officer, born 1923) (1923\u20132012)", "*John Graham, 4th Earl of Menteith (c.1529\u2013c.1565), Scottish nobleman", "*John Graham, 6th Earl of Menteith (c.1571\u2013c.1598), Scottish nobleman", "*John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose (1548\u20131608), Scottish peer", "*John Graham, 4th Earl of Montrose (died 1626), Scottish peer", "*John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee (1648\u20131689), Scottish nobleman and soldier", "*John Graham (died 1755), Scottish politician, MP for Stirlingshire 1722\u201327", "*John Graham (Irish republican) (1915\u20131997), Irish republican", "*Sir John Graham, 4th Baronet (1926\u20132019), British diplomat who was ambassador to Iraq, Iran and NATO", "*John Graham (loyalist) (born c.1945), Ulster loyalist figure", "*John Graham (diplomat) (1774\u20131820), American acting Secretary of State", "*John Graham (New Zealand politician) (1843\u20131926), New Zealand politician", "*John Graham (Manitoba politician) (1864\u20131951), politician in Manitoba, Canada", "*John Graham (Australian politician), member of the New South Wales Legislative Council", "*John Graham (Nunavut politician), politician in Nunavut, Canada", "*John Graham (clergyman) (1774\u20131844), champion of Protestantism in Ireland", "*John Graham (bishop) (1794\u20131865), bishop of Chester, 1845\u20131865", "* Alex Graham (footballer) (1889\u20131972), sometimes identified as John Graham, Scottish footballer for Arsenal, Brentford, Scotland", "* John Graham (forward) (1873\u2013?), English footballer who played as a forward for Newton Heath (Manchester United)", "* John Graham (full back) (1873\u20131925), English footballer for Millwall, Arsenal, Fulham", "* John Graham (footballer, born 1926), English footballer for Aston Villa, Wrexham, Rochdale, and Bradford City", "* John Graham Jr. (golfer) (1877\u20131915), Scottish amateur golfer", "* John Graham (rugby union) (1935\u20132017), New Zealand player, administrator, and educator", "* John Graham (long-distance runner) (born 1956), Scottish marathon runner", "* John Graham (hurdler) (born 1965), Canadian track and field athlete", "* John Graham (racing driver) (born 1966), Canadian", "* John Graham (cricketer) (born 1978), English cricketer", "* John Graham, Sr. (1873\u20131955), architect and founder of John Graham & Company", "* John Graham, Jr. (architect) (1908\u20131991)", "* John Graham (journalist) (1926\u20131974), British political journalist and editor", "* John Graham (Canadian activist) (born 1954), First Nations and AIM activist who murdered opponent", "* John Graham (policy analyst) (born 1956)", "* John Graham (economist) (born 1961), American economist and professor"]}]}}
