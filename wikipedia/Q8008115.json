He was prominent in the affairs of the Royal Agricultural Society and owner of a prize-winning herd of short-horn cattle.  He served as a Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for the Riding from 1832 to 1841, after which  he sat in the House of Lords, having succeeded to the title on the death of his father. From 1826 to 1831 he had sat as an Ultra-Tory MP. He was the first MP to support Richard Oastler's campaign for Factory Reform, and gave it unwavering support for the rest of his life; in 1847 he seconded the Second Reading in the Lords of the Factory Act of that year (the 'Ten-Hour Act').", "link_mentions": {}}}
