United season", "response": ["Having set their sights on A.C. Milan player Antonio Nocerino, D.C. United found their negotiation was undermined when Orlando City S.C.'s Kaka apparently convinced his former teammate to reject United's offer and pursue a contract with Orlando. Fortunately, a plan B quickly emerged. The team filled the holding mid slot by trading for MLS veteran Marcelo Sarvas, and got a bit of an unexpected boost when the name of a former acquisition target, Boca Junior's midfielder/forward Luciano Acosta suddenly showed up on the transfer rumor wires. Within a week, United had the diminutive midfielder signed and training in their Florida pre-season camp. The next day, Acosta even assisted on the lone goal in a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies. Reportedly, United agreed to a trade of a conditional draft pick to New York Red Bulls, who had gained discovery claim priority on Acosta, after United had relinquished its own. As preseason continued, the team released Conor Doyle to make way for a trialist from USL side Pittsburgh Riverhounds, winger Rob Vincent. United took to the pitch for the first time in 2016, with a 2015\u201316 CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal series against Quer\u00e9taro F.C.. In a match in the Mexican mountain city, D.C. United mostly held its own. But, missed chances by the visitors opened the door for the home team, which scored twice in the final 20 minutes, to take a daunting 2-0 lead in the series.", "A short week two-game road trip concluded on a Friday in Chicago, where D.C. once again rescued a point in the final minutes. The game started brightly for the visitors, when they were awarded an indirect free kick just outside the Fire's 6-yard box. Rob Vincent scored his first MLS goal, with a blast through the defense, assisted by Acosta. However, the Fire responded quickly as Luke Mishu, playing for the injured Franklin, lost his mark on a corner kick and surrendered a header for goal. The Fire made it 2-0 not long thereafter, as David Accam dribbled around Birnbaum and took a long shot that found the corner of the goal. Down a goal, United turned in a tired display, and seemed destined for a defeat. As the game went into stoppage time, Mullins took a chance with a spectacular overhead volley that rang off the crossbar. The rebound went to Nyarko, who forced a save by the diving Sean Johnson, but Boswell headed that rebound in for the tying goal. The draw again put United ahead of Orlando City Soccer Club in the race for the final playoff position, \u2013 but only on the goal differential tiebreaker with a big home match against Orlando City looming the following weekend. Both teams actually trailed New England Revolution in that race, by two points, but the Revolution had played an additional game.", "Despite the incident in Havana, Birnbaum was in the starting lineup when NYCFC came to RFK in the final home game of the regular season for DC. Playing before an announced crowd of over 30,000, United played as strong a half as the team had at any time under Coach Ben Olsen. Patrick Mullins put DC out in front as he finished a Lloyd Sam cross in the 27th minute. Four minutes later, Boswell headed in a Sam corner kick to give the home team a much deserved 2-0 lead. Just before halftime, a defensive error allowed United to extend the lead to 3-0. An errant back pass found its way to Mullins, who then found Rob Vincent at the top of the box, leaving Vincent with a wide-open goal to shoot at for his second MLS goal. NYCFC got one back after the 70' mark, when David Villa drew a soft penalty call, and then beat Hamid on the penalty kick. The 3-1 win clinched a postseason spot for United and left them a point ahead of Montreal in the race for 4th place and a home-field advantage in the play-in game.", "| Rob Vincent", "| Rob Vincent", "| Rob Vincent"]}, {"page": "Keystone Derby Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Rob Vincent"]}, {"page": "List of Major League Soccer transfers 2016", "response": ["| Rob Vincent"]}, {"page": "2016 Pittsburgh Riverhounds season", "response": ["| February 17, 2016 ||  Rob Vincent  ||  D.C.
