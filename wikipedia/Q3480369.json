The cover is presented as part of a triptych-style fold-out cover, and the booklet contained abstract artwork that outlined the story. Although the album included lyrics to all the songs, indicating individual characters, it did not outline the plot, which led to a concert programme being prepared for shows, that carried a detailed synopsis."]}, {"page": "A Quick One", "response": ["The album was intended to be pop music, a sonic participant in the pop art movement.

This was in part illustrated by Alan Aldridge who also painted the colourful cover of the Giltrap album. A previous book entitled 'The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast' had inspired an album by Roger Glover of Deep Purple which featured a host of stars.

Aldridge commissioned British photographer Brian Duffy to take a cover photo with Lennon posing next to a birdcage. On the day of photoshoot, Aldridge changed his mind and instead had Lennon dress as the comic book character Superman, with the imagery meant to suggest he had now conquered music, film and literature. DC Comics, the owners of the Superman franchise, claimed the image infringed on their copyright, so Aldridge retouched the photo, replacing the S on the costume's shield with Lennon's initials.
