After he graduated, he worked in the offices of his father's shipping company in the City of London between 1904 and 1907. While working in the City, Japp studied at the night school of the Lambeth School of Art under Philip Connard. Japp studied at the Slade School of Art between 1908 and 1909, where he became friends with his fellow student Stanley Spencer and would often visit him in his home at Cookham in Berkshire. Japp specialised in landscape and figure paintings, and exhibited with the New English Art Club of which he became a member in 1919.\nAt the start of the First World War Japp joined the British Army, and eventually became a Major in the Royal Field Artillery commanding an artillery battery in Macedonia, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. Coincidentally, Spencer also served in Macedonia in the last years of the war and the British War Memorial Committee was keen for both men to be released from their military duties to work on paintings for the proposed, but never built, national Hall of Remembrance. The Army refused to release either of them until after the Armistice, when Japp, following a visit to the Western Front, began work on the painting The Royal Field Artillery in Macedonia, Spring 1918 (1919), which is now part of the collection of the Imperial War Museum.Shortly after the war, Japp gave up painting professionally to farm and to breed race horses in Berkshire. Henry Lamb painted a group portrait of Japp and his family in 1928, which is now in Manchester Art Gallery. Japp left England in 1926, and for the next 27 years lived in France and Spain, before returning to England in 1953. He left England again to live in Portugal some years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Slade School of Fine Art", "response": ["* Darsie Japp (1883\u20131973), artist"]}, {"page": "Hall of Remembrance", "response": ["* The Royal Field Artillery in Macedonia, Spring 1918 by Darsie Japp", "File:The Royal Field Artillery in Macedonia, Spring 1918 by Darsie Japp.jpg| The Royal Field Artillery in Macedonia, Spring 1918 by Darsie Japp"]}, {"page": "British War Memorials Committee", "response": ["In March 1918 the BWMC submitted a request to the War Office seeking the release from front-line service of 16 artists. The War Office refused permission for Eric Gill and Jacob Epstein to be released, and by the time the Army had processed the requests for Stanley Spencer and Darsie Japp the war was almost over. Although Muirhead Bone suggested nineteen well-known, modern women artists, including Dora Carrington and Orovida Pissarro for commissions, the BWMC ignored his advice and only recruited three women artists, Anna Airy, Dorothy Coke and Flora Lion but did not acquire any paintings from them. A number of pacifists and conscientious objectors were approached. Both Duncan Grant and Mark Gertler agreed to work for the Committee but the latter was refused permission by the body supervising conscientious objectors. Harold Knight refused to do any work that could be used as propaganda."]}]}}
