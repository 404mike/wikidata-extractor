Corfield and colleagues discovered that the likely source was contamination of the milk by water from a polluted well in one of the farms. As a result, the company announced that they would conduct weekly sanitary, veterinary, and chemical inspections of the entire milk supply chain. Such sanitary measures were rare at a time when there was no compulsory legislation. The report was an important event in public health  - The Daily Telegraph observed that \u201cthe light thrown by this report upon the powers of Science ought to arouse, and must arouse, the activity of those who are entrusted with the power to protect society\". Murchison believed that the investigation publicised the risk of typhoid through contaminated milk (previously water had been considered the major vector), and encouraged preventive legislation which was eventually enacted in the 1880s."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| Charles Murchison||07/06/1866||26 July 1830 \u2013 23 April 1879"]}, {"page": "Edward Nathaniel Bancroft", "response": ["Bancroft's best title to be remembered in medicine is his \"Essay on the Disease called Yellow Fever, with Observations concerning Febrile Contagion, Typhus Fever, Dysentery, and the Plague, partly delivered as the Gulstonian Lectures before the College of Phvsicians in the years 1806 and 1807\", London, 1811, with a \"Sequel\" to the same, London, 1817. \"Never,\" says Charles Murchison (Continued Fevers of Great Britain, 1st ed. 1862, p.\u00a0111), \"has any work effected a greater revolution in professional opinion in this country.\" The spontaneous, autochthonous, or de novo origin of the contagia of pestilential diseases was then the generally accepted one, though the doctrine of the reproduction of a pathogen existing ab \u00e6terno had been stated, among others, by Alard Mauritius Eggerdes, a Prussian physician, for bubonic plague in 1720. Bancroft's skill in dialectic made the ab \u00e6terno doctrine popular. He argued, \"There is no chance, nor even possibility, of thus generating anything so wonderful and so immutable as contagion, which, resembling animals and vegetables in the faculty of propagating itself, must, like them, have been the original work of our common Creator. ... As well might we revive the for-ever exploded doctrine of equivocal generation\" (Essay, p.\u00a0109). Bancroft explained away facts vouched for by observers such as John Pringle, Donald Monro, and Gilbert Blane. Yellow fever, he also argued, should be identified as a malarial fever. Murchison stated that \"the doctrine of Bancroft was generally adopted, without investigation of the facts upon which it was founded.\""]}, {"page": "Charles Murchison", "response": ["Charles Murchison may refer to:", "* Sir Charles Murchison (politician) (1872\u20131952), British Conservative Party politician", "* Charles Murchison (physician) (1830\u20131879), British physician"]}]}}
