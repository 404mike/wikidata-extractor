The Birmingham Pictorial and Dart: p.12. 21 January 1898. The Dart thought Small Heath were unlucky to lose to West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final of the Staffordshire Cup, as \"they had much more of the actual play than their opponents\", and that if they played as well at home to Blackpool, they could expect to win. At half time, this expectation looked justified, as they led 2\u20131 with goals from Lewis and Bill Robertson, but in the second half Blackpool pulled themselves together and scored twice without reply (as well as having three more \"goals\" disallowed for offside) to secure their first away victory of the season. The game was attended by Jesse Collings, the local Member of Parliament.\"Small Heath v. Blackpool\". Glasgow Herald: p.12. 31 January 1898.\"Football. Notes and Notions\".
