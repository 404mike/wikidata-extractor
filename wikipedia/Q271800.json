On 13 February 2018, the Big Four were described by Member of Parliament (MP) and chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee Frank Field as \"feasting on what was soon to become a carcass\" after collecting fees of \u00a372m for Carillion work during the years leading up to its collapse. The final report of a Parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, published on 16 May 2018, accused the Big Four accounting firms of being a \"cosy club\", with KPMG singled out for its \"complicity\" in signing off on Carillion's \"increasingly fantastical figures\" and internal auditor Deloitte accused of failing to identify, or ignoring, \"terminal failings\". The report recommended the Government refer the statutory audit market to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), urging consideration of breaking up the Big Four. In September 2018, Business Secretary Greg Clark announced he had asked the CMA to conduct an inquiry into competition in the audit sector, and on 9 October 2018, the CMA announced it had launched a detailed study. In July 2020, the UK Financial Reporting Council told the Big Four that they must submit plans by October 2020 to separate their audit and consultancy operations by 2024."]}, {"page": "Magdalene College, Cambridge", "response": ["File:Official portrait of Greg Clark crop 2.jpg|Greg Clark, politician"]}, {"page": "President of the Board of Trade", "response": ["| Greg Clark"]}, {"page": "Royal Tunbridge Wells", "response": ["The Member of Parliament (MP) for Tunbridge Wells is the Conservative Greg Clark, whose majority at the 2017 election was 16,465.\"Constituency election results\" , BBC.

The charter was secured by Bishop John Vesey. This unreformed corporation survived until 1885, when it was replaced by a municipal borough. Although the title \"Royal Town\" was still used, the municipality created in 1885 was not itself a Royal borough. However, the townspeople sometimes still use its historic 'Royal' title. This was confirmed to be allowed in 2014 after a two-year campaign by a local newspaper, the Sutton Coldfield Observer, Andrew Mitchell MP, the Sutton Coldfield Civic Society and various local residents. On Thursday, 12 June 2014 government minister Greg Clark confirmed during a special adjournment debate in the House of Commons that \"there is no statutory ban to the continuance of historic titles for other [non-governance] purposes\" in the absence of a local governing structure using a historic name, and thus the use of the Royal title is not prohibited (although any such usage has a \"lack of technical legal effect\"). Following that confirmation, the newspaper renamed itself the Royal Sutton Coldfield Observer."]}]}}
