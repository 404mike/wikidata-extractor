He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Chippenham from 1806 to 1812 and 1817 to 1818.\nHe was the son of Robert Maitland and his wife Ursula Gorham. His younger brother was Ebenezer Maitland, and his son Ebenezer Maitland was a wealthy landowner.\nIn 1801, he bought Woodford Hall, a large house in Woodford, Essex, with 50 acres of land adjacent to Epping Forest. In 1777, it had been leased to John Goddard, a Rotterdam merchant, whose widow died there in 1814, after which Maitland moved in, dying there in 1831.In 1825, Miss Anne Whitaker, the owner of Loughton Hall and its manor died, and Maitland inherited. In 1745, the Earl of Rochford had sold the manor to William Whitaker of Lime Street, who was an alderman of the City of London. After his death in 1752, it passed to his widow Anne, and on her death in 1770 to their daughter Miss Anne Whitaker.Maitland's large art collection, with works by 48 artists including Titian, D\u00fcrer, Rubens, Van Dyck and Rembrandt, was auctioned by Christie and Manson on 30 July 1831.William Whitaker Maitland, his son, inherited Woodford Hall and leased it to William Cox, and in 1840, to William Morris, father of William Morris the textile designer, poet, and socialist activist, then aged 6.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"|John Maitland", "| John Maitland"]}, {"page": "John Maitland", "response": ["John Maitland may refer to:", "* Sir John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (1537\u20131595), Commendator of Coldingham Priory", "* John Maitland, 1st Earl of Lauderdale (died 1645), Viscount of Lauderdale, Viscount Maitland and Lord Thirlestane & Boltoun, 2nd Lord Maitland of Thirlestane", "* John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale (1616\u20131682), 2nd Earl of Lauderdale", "* John Maitland, 5th Earl of Lauderdale (1655\u20131710), Scottish judge and politician", "* John Maitland (Haddington MP) (1732\u20131779), MP for Haddington Burghs, 1774\u20131880", "* John Maitland (Chippenham MP) (c. 1754\u20131831), MP for Chippenham, 1806\u20131812 and 1817\u20131818", "* John Maitland (Royal Navy officer) (1771\u20131836), Royal Navy admiral ", "* John Maitland (Kirkcudbright MP) (1841\u20131922), MP for Kirkcudbright, 1874\u20131880", "* Sir John Maitland (Conservative politician) (1903\u20131977), MP for Horncastle, 1945\u20131966", "* John Maitland (British Army officer) (1732\u20131779), British commander in American Revolutionary War", "* John Maitland (The Bill), a fictional police officer in the TV series The Bill"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1806\u20131818)", "response": ["|19 June 1817||Chippenham||u||Robert Peel||John Maitland||Resignation to contest Oxford University"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Maitland"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1802 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Brooke \u2013 unseated on petition Replaced by John Maitland 1803"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1807 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Maitland"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1812 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|  Robert Peel \u2013 resigned Replaced by  John Maitland 1817"]}, {"page": "Woodford Hall", "response": ["In 1707, Sir Richard Child sold the Hall to Christopher Crowe, who sold it to William Hunt in 1728, having obtained a private Act of Parliament.

Fastnedge argued it was the version of the subject previously in the Orl\u00e9ans collection, which then passed to John Maitland's collection before being sold at Christie's in 1831, on the basis of the Liverpool Royal Institution's catalogue stating that their painting had come from the Orl\u00e9ans collection.Fastnedge, R., 'Two Italian Pictures Recently Restored at Liverpool', Liverpool Bulletin, vol. 3, nos. 1 and 2, July/October 1953, pp. 15-28 However, the 1843 catalogue's assertion may simply have been an inference by comparison with Jean Louis Delignon's c.1786-1807 engraving of the Orl\u00e9ans collection painting (reversed and with significant differences in the background and foreground), whilst no independent evidence links the painting owned by Maitland to that given by Gibsone. Fastnedge acknowledged this difficulty and argued that the engraving showed the Liverpool painting before it was cut down to the size it now holds, but an early 17th century Pierre Brebiette engraving shows the Liverpool work exactly as it now is."]}, {"page": "George Fludyer", "response": ["Fludyer fell out with the Corporation of Chippenham and gave his interest there to John Maitland.
