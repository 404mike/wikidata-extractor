He also played for the England A cricket team in 1995 and 1996 in first-class and List A games. He was born in Solihull. \nOstler played for most of his career in senior cricket as a specialist right-handed middle-order batsman; he bowled occasionally at right-arm medium pace, was an outstanding fielder at slip and also very occasionally kept wicket. He was a regular in the Warwickshire side pretty much from his debut to the end of 2002, apart from a period in the late 1990s when he lost confidence and form; a second downturn in form led to his retirement in 2003, though he appeared in a few List A matches the following season. He remains as of 2015 a regular player in high-quality Birmingham area club cricket.Ostler made a low-key entry into Warwickshire's first team, but in his third match in 1990 his steadiness, batting at No 8, helped his side to take a somewhat contrived victory over Derbyshire after Derbyshire has forfeited their entire second innings; he scored 42 not out to seal the win after a late collapse. His highest score of this first season was only 71, but he was consistent and scored 510 runs at an average of exactly 30.00 in his eleven games. The following year, when he was awarded his county cap, he played regularly and made 1284 runs at an average of 36.68; the season also contained his first first-class century, an innings of 120 not out that saved the match against Kent after Warwickshire had been forced to follow on.That 1991 season set the pattern for the next four years of Ostler's cricket career: he was a consistent if rarely flamboyant scorer and was ever-present in Warwickshire's middle order in both first-class and List A matches. He passed 1000 first-class runs in a season in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and was only 17 runs short in 1995. In each of these seasons, there were large-scale centuries from Ostler. In 1992, he made 192 against Surrey; the following season, the Essex away match produced a score of 174 for him; in 1994, he scored 186 against Yorkshire; and in 1995 his first double-century was a score of 208 in the home match with Surrey.In the winter of 1995\u201396, Ostler was picked for the England A tour to Pakistan, where he played in three of the five first-class matches; in the game against Pakistan A, he top-scored in England A's first innings with 68, but in the other tour matches he was not successful. The England A team re-assembled for the first representative match of the 1996 season to play against a team called \"The Rest\"; England A won the game, but Ostler scored only 13 and he was not then selected for any further representative matches. Ostler's cricket career then went into a severe decline across the rest of the 1990s to the point where, in 1998, he played in only six first-class matches for Warwickshire, scoring just 173 runs, of which 133 came in a single unbeaten innings against the less-than-arduous bowling of Oxford University. His form in List A cricket remained better for longer, but in both 1998 and 1999 he played in only around half of the county's games.Ostler's return to form and favour came in the 2000 season, when he scored 1096 runs at a career-best average of 49.81; he was also granted a benefit in the 2000 season by Warwickshire. He was heading for similar success in 2001, averaging 47.27 with the bat and having taken 22 catches in just 10 first-class matches, when his season came to an abrupt end with an elbow injury in the July fixture against Derbyshire. Earlier in the 2001 season he had recorded his highest one-day cricket score with an unbeaten innings of 134 against Gloucestershire. He returned for 2002 and scored 1039 first-class runs at an average of 43.29, taking 24 catches in 14 matches as well; the runs included an innings of 225 late in the season against Yorkshire off just 240 balls, which was his highest first-class score. But the following season, 2003, he played only a few games, losing his place in a rotational squad system and not regaining it, and he played just three List A games and one Twenty20 game in 2004 before retiring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Berkswell", "response": ["Notable people from Berkswell include the actor Jeremy Brett, whose roles include Sherlock Holmes in a television drama series, tennis player Maud Watson \u2013 the first Ladies Singles Champion in 1884 at The Championships, Wimbledon and Bob Wyatt (R.E.S.), England Cricket Captain for a number of years from 1934.

Two batsmen, Andy Moles and Dominic Ostler passed 1,000 runs while only Neil Smith, with 44, took more than 30 wickets. In one-day competitions they finished 10th in the National League, were knocked out of the first round of the Benson and Hedges Cup, and won the Natwest Trophy. They beat Sussex by five wickets in the Lord's final, chasing down 322 with Asif Din scoring a century and Dermot Reeve finishing unbeaten on 81.", "|| Dominic Ostler ||  || Right-handed || Right arm medium pace || Warwickshire cap - 1991", "Durham won the toss and on an easy paced pitch chose to bat first. After both openers were dismissed inside the first 75 minutes, number three John Morris shared century partnerships with Stewart Hutton (61) and Phil Bainbridge (67). Morris was dismissed early on the second day but his innings of 204 was the highest by a Durham player at the time, it was also his first century for Durham since moving from Derbyshire. An eighth wicket stand of 134 between Anderson Cummins  (62) and David Graveney (65*) boosted the total before a mid-afternoon declaration. The early wicket of Dominic Ostler brought Brian Lara to the crease, dropped on 18 by wicket-keeper Chris Scott at the close Lara was 111 not out and had become the first player to score seven centuries in eight innings. The third day of the match was rained off and with the captains unable to agree on a target, Lara had free rein to bat on. He took the opportunity by scoring 174 runs in the pre-lunch session, in the afternoon he added a further 133 and in the process beat the previous best by a Warwickshire player (305* by Frank Foster) and passed 1,000 runs for the season in only his seventh innings. After tea he passed Archie MacLaren's 424, the highest score in England, and progressed to 497 by the time of the final over. Still two runs short of the first-class record, Lara was made aware it was the last over of the match by batting partner Keith Piper after the fourth ball, the next delivery was driven for four to break the record. Lara's innings took 427 balls and lasted less than eight hours. He broke the records for most boundaries in an innings (72) and most runs in a single day (390). Trevor Penney contributed just 44 to a third wicket partnership of 314 with Lara while the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership between Lara and Piper was worth 322. The team total of 810/4 bettered the county record by over 150 runs.", "Having won the toss and batted first, Warwickshire pair of Roger Twose and Dominic Ostler (94) put on 196, their largest opening partnership of the season. The stand delayed the appearance of Brian Lara, in his first Championship innings since his record-breaking innings he made a sketchy 19. Contributions down the order took the total past 400 by the time of their dismissal shortly after lunch on the second day. After the early loss of Mark Benson, Kent batted cautiously until Carl Hooper's arrival at 60/2. He batted fluently in reaching a century from 131 balls and shared 109 in 28 overs for the third wicket with David Ward (63). On the third day Richard Davis took a sharp return catch to dismiss Hooper and although Matthew Fleming struck an aggressive 73, Warwickshire were able to gain a first innings lead. The hosts openers put on a second century stand of the match, before 86 runs in 55 minutes on the fourth morning allowed a declaration. The target of 347 off 82 overs on a turning pitch proved too much as Kent's batsmen were unable to go on after making starts. Neil Smith's figures of 7/133 were a career best while fellow spinner Davis took the other three wickets.", "Warwickshire won the toss and built a formidable first day total of 448/9 after Brian Lara scored an eighth century in eleven innings. His score of 197 took 195 balls and contained 30 fours and 3 sixes. The only bowler to contain Lara was Curtly Ambrose who conceded 12 runs from the 45 balls he delivered to him. The second highest score was 39 from Trevor Penney who put on 168 in 31 overs with Lara. The last wicket partnership between Graeme Welch and Tim Munton grew to 68 before the innings was ended. Early in the reply Munton took the wickets of both openers before a 137 run partnership between Allan Lamb and Rob Bailey (54) recovered the situation. Welch, on his Championship debut, took the wickets of Lamb, Bailey and Mal Loye in a 22 ball spell and Northamptonshire lost their last 5 wickets for 27 runs allowing Warwickshire to enforce the follow on. Northamptonshire fared better second time around despite losing their first four wickets by the time the score reached 83. Loye and Kevin Curran (56) repaired the innings so the hosts ended day three with a lead of 84 runs and three wickets remaining. Loye, 99 overnight, reached his century before his seven-hour innings was ended. The resistance was continued by Russell Warren (94) and tail-ender Paul Taylor who took 113 balls for his 26. Needing 228 in 38 overs, Warwickshire won with three balls to spare. Dominic Ostler and Roger Twose (39) shared a fourth consecutive century opening stand while Penney, promoted to number three, added 43.", "Derbyshire won the toss and on a green pitch bowled first. Brian Lara struck his eighth century of the season including a hundred, off 94 balls, before lunch. He put on 160 for the fourth wicket with Trevor Penney (41) who was the only other batsman to pass 17. Tim Munton took three wickets as Derbyshire closed day one on 165/6. On the second morning Munton took the remaining four wickets in 23 balls to finish with 7/52, his seventh five wicket haul and best figures of the season. Dominic Ostler and Andy Moles (63) added 114 in 29 overs for the third wicket after the fall of Lara for 51 off 45. Derbyshire captain Kim Barnett took the wicket of Moles which sparked a collapse from 190/2, his leg-spin took five wickets while off-spinner Matthew Vandrau claimed three. The second day closed with Derbyshire on 26/1 in pursuit of 342. Munton took two wickets in his opening spell to reduce the hosts to 35/4, from there wickets fell regularly with off-spinner Neil Smith taking 5/69. Wicket-keeper Keith Piper took seven dismissals in the innings, equalling the Warwickshire record for the second match running. He also took 11 dismissals in the match which broke the county record and was one short of the first-class record.", "Yorkshire won the toss and batted first on a slow but flat pitch. They had lost five wickets for 175 by mid afternoon but a sixth wicket stand of 94 between Bradley Parker and Peter Hartley (61) boosted the total. Parker's innings was a career best and contained eight fours. Debutant Alex Wharf claimed Brian Lara as his maiden wicket in first-class cricket, to leave Warwickshire on 44/2. Opener Andy Moles (65) and Dominic Ostler put on 191 in 67 overs for the third wicket, building the platform for a significant first innings lead. Twose innings included 21 fours and a six and fell six runs short of a career best score. The visitors closed day two with a lead of 36 and five wickets remaining. Welch scored a third fifty in consecutive matches and aided by contributions from the lower order the lead was increased to 149. Yorkshire began well in response, openers Martyn Moxon and Michael Vaughan (49) put on 93 before the latter was bowled by Richard Davis. Davis took two further wickets in quick succession to reduce them to 109/3. Moxton reached a third century of the season and alongside Richard Blakey put on 92 before play ended. Moxton added 10 to his overnight score but a fluent 77 from Blakey and a spirited 46 by Wharf saw the innings well into the final afternoon. Davis took three further wickets, finishing with his first five wicket haul for the club. The target for Warwickshire was 199 in 49 overs and an opening stand of 89 in 16 overs between Moles (48) and Twose ensured it was a comfortable chase, achieved with eight and a half overs in hand.", "After rain delayed the start until 2.30pm, Sussex won the toss and batted first. They made a solid start, reaching 59/1 after 90 minutes of play before Roger Twose in his fourth over took three wickets. Jamie Hall and Peter Moores (29) steadied the innings with a partnership of 42 but the wicket of Hall caused a collapse from 103/4 to 131 all out. Warwickshire lost two wickets in the remaining three overs. With the visitors on 67/5 the match was evenly poised but Dominic Ostler and Trevor Penney (24) put on 67 for the sixth wicket, Ostler was the only player to score a half-century in the match. A ninth wicket stand of 30 between Graeme Welch and Gladstone Small increased the lead past 50, substantial under the circumstances. Sussex lost regular wickets in their second innings and closed day two on 107/8 with top scoring Martin Speight unbeaten on 38. Tim Munton dismissed Speight with the second ball of the third day and shortly afterwards took the final wicket to finish with eight wickets in the match. Requiring 76 to win, openers Andy Moles and Twose saw Warwickshire to victory without loss.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Dominic Ostler || 17 || 1,012 || 38.92 || 186 || 1/6 || 1.1 || 0 || \u2013 || \u2013 || 14", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Dominic Ostler || 17 || 530 || 33.12 || 84* || 0/5 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || 4", "Despite Warwickshire's success, none of the players were selected for the 1994\u201395 Ashes series while just one, Keith Piper, was selected for the England A team's tour of India.
