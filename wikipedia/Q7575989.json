He starred in two significant programmes: the popular children's science fiction serial Timeslip as Simon Randall, and the Play for Today Penda's Fen (1974) by David Rudkin directed by Alan Clarke.  He also appeared in television series including Alexander the Greatest, The Witch's Daughter, Tightrope, The Georgian House, Crossroads and Backs to the Land, films such as Diamonds on Wheels (1973) and A Christmas Carol (1984), and a 1981 radio version of The Chrysalids. In 2015 he appeared as 'Reverend Simon Randall' in The Amityville Playhouse opposite former Timeslip co-star Cheryl Burfield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeslip", "response": ["The series is centred on two children, Simon Randall (Spencer Banks) and Liz Skinner (Cheryl Burfield) who discover the existence of a strange anomaly, known as the Time Barrier, which enables them to travel in time and visit the past and alternative futures. Although only described as a means for time travel, and the time barrier generally originating and ending their adventures in a field at a disused military base, the barrier can also move the children through locations. For example, they travel from St. Oswald\u2019s 1940 to the Antarctic 1990 in one journey through the barrier.", "Timeslip was the first major television role for Spencer Banks, who played Simon Randall. Unlike his co-star, no change was needed to the age of his character; even though he was 15 at the time, he was able to pass as younger. Regarding the age difference between the two, Banks recalled that on their first meeting Cheryl Burfield remarked that she looked \"positively matronly beside him\".Houldsworth, Fantasy Flashback \u2013 Timeslip: The Time of the IceBox, p. 54. However, over the course of production, Banks grew and matured and his voice broke. Banks went to star in the children's series Tightrope (1972) (made by the same team behind Timeslip) and The Georgian House (1976). He also starred in the highly acclaimed TV drama Penda's Fen (1974) by David Rudkin.", "*Simon Randall: Spencer Banks", "Timeslip: Behind the Barrier, an independent documentary chronicling the making of Timeslip was produced in 2009.
