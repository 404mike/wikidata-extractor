Brennan's older brother, Billy Brennan was the club's player-coach. In 1970, the Mohawks folded and Brennan went to play for the Ayr Bruins. In 1972, Brennan was involved in a car accident and suffered from a broken neck. He was told that we would not be able to play ice hockey again. Although Brennan fought his way to a full recovery he found that no coach was prepared to play him for fear of causing further injury. However, Lawrie Lovell, Fife Flyers' player-coach eventually gave Brennan a chance and he went on to play seven seasons with the club."]}]}}
