WWE executive Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque said the eventual plan with the new title and tournament was to establish a UK-based brand with its own weekly television show. WWE subsequently launched its UK-based brand as an offshoot of NXT, NXT UK, in June 2018, with Johnny Saint serving as inaugural general manager."]}, {"page": "Blackpool", "response": ["Several renowned wrestlers have invested in Blackpool.

He was reunited, on a 1979 edition of ITV's This Is Your Life, with a woman whose life he had saved."]}, {"page": "Professional wrestling holds", "response": ["The move used to trick an unsuspecting opponent. The wrestler sits down, crosses their legs, tucks their head into their chest and wraps one arm around their ankle (so they are effectively rolled into a ball). The wrestler then extends their remaining arm between their legs and then waits. The opponent, ostensibly confused, normally takes the offered hand, at which point the wrestler rolls forward and into an armlock. This was used by Johnny Saint as the Johnny Saint Special."]}, {"page": "Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The gap left by TWA in the traditional British scene was later filled by such promotions as Revolution British Wrestling (RBW) and later still LDN's Academy/Spirit League. In the mid-2000s, Adam Mumford's Revolution British Wrestling promotion (run as an adjunct of his wrestling tape trading business in much the same manner as the American Ring Of Honor promotion in its infancy) picked up where TWA left off with promoting the British Welterweight and British Middleweight titles. After the company ceased promoting in 2006, LDN Wrestling emerged as a British-based World of Sport\u2013style product that has brought many of the legendary names out of retirement such as Kendo Nagasaki, Johnny Saint and Johnny Kincaid. In November 2008 along with the Wrestling Channel, it presented a \"World of Sport Reunion Show\" in front of a sellout crowd. Starting in the autumn of 2010, it began a full-time touring schedule of shows in a bid to compete with All Star, often at some of All Star's main regular venues.", "The World Of Sport Wrestling TV revival resumed production with tapings 10\u201312 May 2018 and transmission on ITV 28 July - 29 September 2018. This was followed by six live tour dates (of an originally scheduled nine) in January/February 2019. Meanwhile, WWE once again held the WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament in London in June 2018. WWE introduced World Of Sport and UK Wrestling legend Johnny Saint as its General Manager earlier that month for their newly established NXT UK brand of which the UK Championship would be the top championship. At the WWE UK Tournament Day 1 taping, Saint along with Triple H introduced the NXT UK show for their UK wrestlers and also established the NXT UK Women's Championship and the NXT UK Tag Team Championship."]}]}}
