He succeeded to the title of  Baronet Raymond of Valentine House on 20 January 1796. In 1806 he was elected as M.P. for New Shoreham  and he held the seat until his death in 1862.\n\nBurrell built a country mansion near Knepp Castle, known by the same name, near West Grinstead and purchased an estate at  Boulton. He owned a house in Richmond Terrace, London which was the subject of a court case in 1833 in which he argued that because the house was on the site of the former Palace of Whitehall, it was not liable to the poor rate of St. Margaret's, Westminster.Burrell married Frances Wyndham, the illegitimate daughter of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, and Elizabeth Ilive, on 4 July 1808 at St. George's Church, Hanover Square. Their eldest son Charles Wyndham Burrell died aged seventeen, but his other sons Percy and Walter succeeded successively to the baronetcy and the seat of New Shoreham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont", "response": ["** Frances Wyndham (1789\u20131848), married Sir Charles Burrell, 3rd Baronet and had issue."]}, {"page": "Percy Burrell", "response": ["Born at Grosvenor Place, London, he was the second son of Sir Charles Burrell, 3rd Baronet and his wife Frances Wyndham, an illegitimate daughter of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont.
