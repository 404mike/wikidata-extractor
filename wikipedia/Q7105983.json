He was prolific in front of goal, scoring 44 goals in 62 league and cup appearances \u2013 this scoring record made his job as manager much easier. The \"Stags\" finished eighth in the Third Division North in 1949\u201350. They then went on a 23-game unbeaten run, but could only end up finishing as the division's runners-up in 1950\u201351, seven points behind champions Rotherham United.
