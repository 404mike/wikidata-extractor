The production featured Wilfred Walter as Titus, Florence Saunders as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Jane Bacon as Lavinia. Reviews at the time praised Hayes' performance but criticised Walter's as monotonous.Dessen (1989: 12) Atkins staged the play with a strong sense of Elizabethan theatrical authenticity, with a plain black backdrop, and a minimum of props. Critically, the production met with mixed reviews, some welcoming the return of the original play to the stage, some questioning why Atkins had bothered when various adaptations were much better and still extant. Nevertheless, the play was a huge box office success, one of the most successful in the Complete Works presentation.Harcourt Williams, Old Vic Saga (London: Winchester, 1949), 51"]}, {"page": "Journey into Space", "response": ["|Wilfred Walter"]}, {"page": "Convict 99", "response": ["* Wilfred Walter - Max Slessor"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1936", "response": ["|Hearts of Humanity||John Baxter||Bransby Williams, Wilfred Walter||Drama||"]}, {"page": "A Window in London", "response": ["* Wilfred Walter as Foreman"]}, {"page": "The Dark Eyes of London (film)", "response": ["After Diane finds one of her father's cufflinks at the Home, Orloff sends his henchman Jake (Wilfred Walter), a deformed blind resident of the Home, to kill Diane who has found out too much about them but she eludes him with the help of the young police inspector on the case.

The play was not initially successful, partly because of the novelty of animal characters and the long delays (not all the fault of Rostand), but also to Guitry's uninspired performance, and because the sophisticated Parisians in the audience realised their way of life was being criticised. A revival in 1927, starring Victor Francen, was more successful. A notable British production was Terence Gray's final production at the Cambridge Festival Theatre in 1933 before he terminated his ownership of the theatre. Wilfred Walter, an experienced actor, played Chantecler, and the cast included most of the Festival's actors of the day, including Doria Paston, Gilson MacCormnack, Noel Iliff, the dancer Sara Patrick and the next director of the theatre, Joseph Macleod.
