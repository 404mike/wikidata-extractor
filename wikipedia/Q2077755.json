The British battleship scored a hit on Bismarck with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on Prince of Wales, though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain John Leach, the ship's commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon Prince of Wales, causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, Prince of Wales scored three hits on Bismarck in the engagement. The first struck her in the forecastle above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead, completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room. The third shell passed through one of the boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding."]}, {"page": "HMS Prince of Wales (53)", "response": ["On 22 May 1941, Prince of Wales, the battlecruiser  and six destroyers were ordered to take station south of Iceland and intercept the  if she attempted to break out into the Atlantic.

The fourth hits the vessel just below its main mast, penetrating through the thin deck armour; suddenly the ship's deck simultaneously disintegrates and explodes in a massive fireball, even blowing one of the turrets off into the ocean. Both sides are shocked and horrified at the devastation, as Hoods remains are enveloped by smoke.

No more was heard of the proposal.Kennedy, p. 212Kennedy expounds on the court-martial claim via the epilogue in Pursuit \u2013 The Sinking of the Bismarck. According to Kennedy the claim for a proposal to court martial Leach and Wake-Walker came from post-war letters written by Admiral Tovey, after he retired, and not from Admiralty sources. Kennedy states in his epilogue that \"...later in life Tovey's memory let him down...\" and that plus the fact that Leach and Wake-Walker were retained in their commands and given commendations must cast considerable doubt on the court martial proposal. King George V was extremely short of fuel and had stayed at the scene far longer than Tovey had thought it could, so another cause for friction between Tovey and his political and professional superiors was a signal that his flagship was to remain in action until Bismarck had sunk, \"Bismarck must be sunk at all costs ... even if it ... means towing King George V\". In these circumstances it would have been highly likely that the ship would have been lost to either U-boats or aircraft. The signal had initially caused amusement amongst Tovey and his staff, but later its risks and implications angered them; Tovey later said \"It was the stupidest and most ill-considered signal ever made\" and he made it clear that he would have disobeyed and risked court-martial.Kennedy, pp. 211\u2013212"]}, {"page": "Esmond Knight", "response": ["In the film Sink the Bismarck!

This Lindemann quotation is cited by Burkard Freiherr von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg who at the time was in the after gun director keeping a watch out for Suffolk and Norfolk and listening to Schneider's commands over the gunnery intercom.

This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship.
