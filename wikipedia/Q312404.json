Best known for his first stint at Leeds United and Juventus, he was rated by many as the greatest all-round footballer ever to come from Britain.Charles began his career at Leeds United, having moved there in 1949 from his hometown club, Swansea Town. He was equally adept as a defender or a forward, due to his strength, pace, technique, vision, ability in the air and eye for goal. After returning from his National Service in 1952, Charles began to be used more often as a forward, and he was the Second Division's top scorer in 1954. The following year, he was named club captain; in his first season as captain, he led the club to second place and promotion. Charles ended the 1956\u201357 season as the First Division's top scorer and an eighth-place finish for Leeds. In the summer of 1957, Charles joined Juventus, where he partnered Giampiero Boniperti and Omar S\u00edvori, with the trio becoming known as The Holy Trident. In his five seasons with the club, he won the scudetto three times and the Coppa Italia twice; he was also the capocannoniere winner for the 1957\u201358 season. In 1962, Charles returned to Leeds, but his time there proved unsuccessful as he was accustomed to the style of play in Italy, and by the end of the year, he had joined Roma. Charles moved back to his native country to play for Cardiff City, and ended his career in non-league football in player-manager roles at Hereford United and Merthyr Tydfil. He was never cautioned nor sent off during his entire career, owing to his philosophy of never kicking nor intentionally hurting opposing players. This led to the nickname he acquired while playing for Juventus, Il Gigante Buono (The Gentle Giant). In 1998, he was included in the Football League 100 Legends, and in 2002, he was one of the inaugural inductees to the Football Hall of Fame.\nHe represented the Welsh national team over fifteen years, from 1950 to 1965. Alongside his brother, Mel Charles, he was a member of the Welsh squad at the 1958 FIFA World Cup. At the tournament, he scored in a 1\u20131 draw with Hungary, but he got injured in a play-off match against the same opposition. Ruled out of the quarter-final against Brazil, Wales lost the match 1\u20130, with Pel\u00e9 scoring the winner. Wales manager Jimmy Murphy opined that had Charles been fit, Wales might have won the match.\nFor its 50th anniversary in 2004, UEFA asked each of its then 52 member associations to nominate one player as the single most outstanding player of the period 1954\u20132003, and Charles was chosen as the Golden Player of Wales by its national association in November 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 21", "response": ["*2004 \u2013 John Charles, Welsh footballer and manager (b. 1931)"]}, {"page": "Juventus F.C.", "response": ["Juventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed president. The club added two more league championships to its name in the 1949\u201350 and 1951\u201352 seasons, the first of which was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver. For the 1957\u201358 season, two new strikers, Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar S\u00edvori, were signed to play alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. In the 1959\u201360 season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning Serie A and Coppa Italia. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182\u00a0goals in all competitions, a club record which stood for 45 years."]}, {"page": "1931", "response": ["** John Charles, Welsh international footballer (d. 2004)"]}, {"page": "2004", "response": ["* February 21 \u2013 John Charles, Welsh footballer (b. 1931)"]}, {"page": "Swansea", "response": ["* John Charles : 4 March 2001."]}, {"page": "1958 FIFA World Cup", "response": ["*  John Charles"]}, {"page": "Wales", "response": ["Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League, since 1992. For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system; Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham,  and Merthyr Town. Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles, John Toshack, Gary Speed, Ian Rush, Ryan Giggs, Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, and Daniel James. At UEFA Euro 2016, the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal."]}, {"page": "Stanley Matthews", "response": ["Franz Beckenbauer said that the speed and skill Matthews possessed meant that \"almost no one in the game could stop him\". John Charles noted that \"he was the best crosser I've ever seen \u2013 and he had to contend with the old heavy ball\". Johnny Giles said that \"he had everything \u2013 good close control, great dribbling ability and he was lightning quick. He was also an intelligent player, who knew how to pass the ball\". Despite his great talents, he rarely tackled opponents and was not adept at heading the ball or using his left foot."]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Charlton played for Leeds United's youth team in the Northern Intermediate League and then for the third team in the Yorkshire League; playing in the physically demanding Yorkshire League at the age of 16 impressed the club's management, and he was soon promoted to the reserve team. Charlton was given his first professional contract when he turned 17. He made his debut on 25 April 1953 against Doncaster Rovers, taking John Charles' place at centre-half after Charles was moved up to centre-forward. It was the final Second Division game of the 1952\u201353 season, and ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He then had to serve two years' national service with the Household Cavalry, and captained the Horse Guards to victory in the Cavalry Cup in Hanover. His national service limited his contribution to Leeds, and he made only one appearance in the 1954\u201355 season."]}, {"page": "Ambidexterity", "response": ["In association football, being able to kick with either foot provides more options for both passing and scoring, as well as the ability to play on either side of the pitch. Therefore, players with the ability to use their weaker foot with proficiency are valuable in any team. Examples of ambidextrous footballers include Johan Cruyff, Obafemi Martins, Santi Cazorla, Adam Lallana, Adriano Correia, Pedro Rodriguez, Glenn Hoddle, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, S\u00f3crates, Paolo Maldini, George Best, Michael Laudrup, Pel\u00e9, Marc Overmars, Michel Platini, Roberto Baggio, Carlos Valderrama, Bobby Charlton, Zico, Tom Finney, John Barnes, John Charles, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Mason Greenwood, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zidane, Wayne Rooney."]}]}}
