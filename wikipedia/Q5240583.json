David V. Barrett, in the Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements, specifies that now  are \"those independent bishops who collect several different lines of transmission of apostolic succession, and who will happily (and sometimes for a fee) consecrate anyone who requests it.\" Those described as wandering bishops often see the term as pejorative. The general term for \"wandering\" clerics, as were common in the Middle Ages, is clerici vagantes; the general term for those recognising no leader is acephali.", " David V.
