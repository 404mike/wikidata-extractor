With only one player signed for a transfer fee, Graham Turner again relied heavily on the loan market; attracting players such as Bruno Ngotty and Matt Murray, as well as youngsters from both Manchester United and Liverpool. The season saw them struggle to compete against better funded and supported clubs; by mid-October they were bottom with only six points. Patches of good form in mid-seasons saw them threaten to escape the relegation zone, but five consecutive defeats in March have made survival increasingly difficult. Manager Jamie Pitman was sacked in March 2012 following a poor run of form.

We've got 12 games to show and prove to people just what we can do.\" He got his first point in charge at the club the following day, when his side squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2\u20132 with Macclesfield Town at Moss Rose. Four days later they beat Morecambe 1\u20130 at the Globe Arena, further boosting their chances of survival. He later signed full-back James Chambers and winger James Baxendale on loan from Doncaster Rovers. To avoid relegation on the last day of the campaign, the \"Bulls\" needed to beat Torquay United and hope Burton Albion could avoid defeat at home to Barnet. Chairman David Keyte said that he should have appointed O'Kelly earlier in the season. His team won a futile 3\u20132 victory, as a win for Barnet sent Hereford back down to the Conference.
