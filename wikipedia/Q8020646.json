Yalden played mainly for Chertsey and Surrey though he was also a regular, sometimes as captain, in England XI teams, particularly in matches against Hampshire. His career began in the 1760s and he is known to have played until 1785.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["Cricket became well established in Surrey during the 17th century and the earliest village matches took place before the English Civil War. It is believed that the earliest county teams were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660. The earliest known first-class match in Surrey was Croydon v London at Croydon on 1 July 1707. In 1709, the earliest known inter-county match took place between Kent and Surrey at Dartford Brent with \u00a350 at stake. Surrey would continue to play cricket against other representative teams from that time onwards. Probably its greatest players during the underarm era were the famous bowler Lumpy Stevens and the wicket-keeper/batsman William Yalden, who both belonged to the Chertsey club."]}, {"page": "John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset", "response": ["There is a story that, as the revolution began, Dorset was planning what might have become the first international cricket tour by forming an England team to play matches in France.

According to John Major in More Than A Game, \"the whole story is nonsense\".

Small played in all three matches and was easily the season's highest runscorer with 213 in his six innings. The only other player to exceed 100 was William Yalden who made 136, also in six innings. In the first match of the season, Small scored 78 for Hampshire against All-England out of a team total of 146. In the second innings, he scored 34 out of 79 and his team won by 53 runs, an illustration of his enormous value to Hampshire.Ashley-Cooper, p. 177. His innings of 78 was the highest individual score definitely recorded to that time. Although higher scores such as Richard Newland's 88 in 1745 and Small's own 140-plus in 1768 have been mentioned in the sources, it is not clear if those were definitely made in one innings or if they were match totals."]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["* 88 \u2013 William Yalden for Surrey v Hampshire at Broadhalfpenny Down in 1773.F.

Sueter and Yalden are the earliest players to be recognised as \"wicketkeeper/batsmen\", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone.
