A hat-trick from Albert Quixall and goals from Nobby Stiles and Maurice Setters saw United win 5\u20130.  Bob Ferrier, writing in The Observer, suggested that United had overwhelmed Ipswich \"so completely and so unexpectedly that it was well-nigh incredible.\"  The following week, Ipswich hosted Cardiff City and secured a 1\u20130 win with an early goal from Moran.  Two games in two days followed, over the Easter bank holiday, with Ipswich drawing the first 2\u20132 with Arsenal on Good Friday. In front of a record Portman Road crowd of 30,649, the visitors took a 2\u20130 lead through Johnny MacLeod and George Eastham.  Phillips pulled one back from the penalty spot and Leadbetter equalised with five minutes remaining to secure the draw.  The following day saw Ipswich travel to Stamford Bridge to take on Chelsea.  First-half goals from Peter Brabrook and Barry Bridges were cancelled out in the second half by Crawford and a Phillips penalty, for Ipswich's second 2\u20132 draw in two days which consigned Chelsea to relegation.  Championship rivals Burnley were still involved in the FA Cup and had won just one of their seven league fixtures in April by the end of Easter Saturday to lay second in the league, a point behind Ipswich but with a game in hand."]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*  Johnny MacLeod, Right Midfield, 27"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*  Johnny MacLeod, Right Midfield, 26 "]}]}}
