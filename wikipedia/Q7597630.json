Flashman also brought his son, Mark, to the club as a reserve goalkeeper. In spite of the financial problems, Barnet finished third in the new Division Three and secured the final automatic promotion spot. Manager Barry Fry, however, left Barnet with a handful of games remaining and was replaced by his assistant Edwin Stein, who himself then left to join Fry in the summer at Southend United. Goalkeeper Gary Phillips took over as manager during a difficult summer in which Barnet marginally survived a vote of expulsion by a Football League EGM, and lost the vast majority of their promotion winning side in a tribunal which nullified the players' contracts. Phillips cobbled together a squad from the few remaining players and free transfers. In January 1994 Phillips was assisted by former England goalkeeper Ray Clemence, but were still relegated from Division Two. In August 1994 Ray Clemence became sole manager for two seasons, finishing 11th and then 9th in Division Three. Then at the start of the 1996\u201397 season Ray Clemence left to become England goalkeeping coach, leaving Terry Bullivant in charge."]}, {"page": "Barry Fry", "response": ["After spells at Hillingdon Borough and hometown club Bedford Town, in 1979 Fry became Barnet manager for the first of two management spells covering almost thirteen seasons. In his first spell, Barnet maintained a mid-table position in the Alliance League for six seasons before Fry left in December 1985 to manage Maidstone United. He returned to Barnet in August 1986 for a further seven seasons. Three times runners-up in the GM Vauxhall Conference, Fry achieved his first managerial success as Champions in 1990\u201391. Two years later he guided them towards the new Division Two (leaving two months before the end of the season to manage Southend United) despite being sacked eight times and reinstated each time by controversial chairman Stan Flashman, as well as being in charge of a club which was in a precarious financial state and under threat of expulsion from the Football League.

The month ends with Norwich City back on top of the Premier League, though Aston Villa are just a point behind with a match in hand. Manchester United are still close behind, while Blackburn Rovers have three matches in hand on the leaders. Nottingham Forest have slipped back into the relegation zone behind Sheffield United, while Oldham Athletic are still in the relegation zone and Middlesbrough now occupy bottom place. In Division One, Newcastle United still lead the way, though West Ham United have cut their lead down to five points. Portsmouth, Swindon Town, Millwall and Leicester City occupy the playoff zone. A dismal run of form for Tranmere Rovers has taken them from second to seventh place in just three months, and they are now six points outside the playoff zone. A dismal month for Grimsby Town has seen their promotion challenge virtually ended; in fact, they are actually closer to the relegation zone than to sixth place (albeit only by goal difference). Bristol Rovers are six points away from safety and look certain for relegation, but fellow strugglers Southend and Cambridge end March still optimistic of avoiding the drop. In Division Two, Stoke City are ten points clear of second-placed Port Vale and looking all but assured of promotion.

He made funds available to manager Barry Fry in hope of building a quality side, and this paid off with promotion to the Football League in 1991, but he had quit within two years with the club knee deep in financial problems once again. Although Flashman's rash attitude (which saw him sack and reinstate Fry eight times) made him unpopular with most Barnet fans, it is unlikely that Barnet would have experienced league football without his takeover \u2013 they could well have gone out of business."]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Football League", "response": ["As the Division Three campaign got underway, the two Welsh based sides in the division emerged as the pace-setters, with Cardiff City finishing as champions and Wrexham as runners-up. Barnet, who had spent much of the season under threat of going the same way as Maidstone due to mounting debts, being banned from the transfer market for failing to pay staff wages, and being threatened with expulsion from the Football League over an unapid fine, clinched the final automatic promotion place in only their second season in the Football League. The season also brought the end of Stan Flashman's eight-year ownership of the club, when he resigned as chairman of the club he had paid \u00a350,000 to save from receivership in 1985. Just before promotion was clinched, manager Barry Fry left to take charge of Southend United, with his assistant Edwin Stein overseeing the final few games of the season before goalkeeper Gary Phillips took over as player-manager for the 1993-94 season."]}]}}
