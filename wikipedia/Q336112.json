He was a Labour Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1994 to 1999 and was elevated to the peerage in 2004. He has written on Russia, defence and energy, and works with a variety of companies in the field of non-renewable resource extraction.\nPreviously somewhat low-profile in British politics, Truscott made headlines in 2009 as one of four Labour peers named by the Sunday Times as being willing to accept money to help companies amend bills that would have an adverse effect on them. He consequently became one of the first peers suspended from the House of Lords since the 17th century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott"]}, {"page": "Truscott", "response": ["* Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott (born 1959), British Labour politician"]}, {"page": "Lord Truscott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott"]}, {"page": "1959 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott, Labour politician and peer"]}, {"page": "Baron Truscott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott"]}, {"page": "March 20", "response": ["*  1959   \u2013 Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott, British Labour Party politician and peer"]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott"]}, {"page": "List of people named Peter", "response": ["* Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott, British Labour Party politician and peer"]}, {"page": "Peter Derek Truscott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott"]}, {"page": "Baron Truscott, of St. James's in the City of Westminster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott"]}]}}
