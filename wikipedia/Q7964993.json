He was the first Nature news correspondent appointed by editor John Maddox. Oliver Sacks of Nature writes that his reviews have high literary quality and show knowledge of a wide range of topics. He was a friend of James D. Watson, and wrote the introduction and afterword of his A Passion for DNA.Gratzer received his BA in chemistry in 1954 and his MA in 1958 from the University of Oxford, and his PhD in 1960 from the National Institute for Medical Research. He was a research fellow at Harvard University from 1960 to 1963, a lecturer in biophysics at King's from 1963 to 1966, and worked at the Medical Research Council from 1966 to 1996. He died in London on 20 October 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Human nutrition", "response": ["According to Walter Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of qi developed, a spirit or \"wind\" similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma.Gratzer 2005, p. 40. Food was classified into \"hot\" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and \"cold\" (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia. Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi. Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets.Gratzer 2005, p. 41. About the same time in Italy, Alcmaeon of Croton (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by obesity or emaciation.Gratzer 2005, p. 36."]}, {"page": "Gratzer", "response": ["* Walter Gratzer (1932-2021), British biophysical chemist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2021", "response": ["*Walter Gratzer, 89, German-born British biophysical chemist.Walter Gratzer obituary"]}, {"page": "Robert Ehrlich (physicist)", "response": ["Eight Preposterous Propositions: from The Genetics of Homosexuality to The Benefits of Global Warming.

In his book Terrors of the Table: The Curious History of Nutrition (2005), British biophysicist Walter Gratzer describes Sinclair as \"the most credulous of faddists.\" Gratzer also writes, \"In what passes for a caveat he remarks [in his book The Book of Life (1921)]: 'I have known two or three cases of people dying while they were fasting, but I feel quite certain that the fast did not cause their death.' The irony in all this farrago is that we now have good evidence for an increased life-span in rodents kept in laboratory conditions on a very low-calorie diet.\" Likewise, the authors of the book Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything (2017) write, \"Although modern doctors would strongly disagree with Sinclair's unsolicited medical advice, there have been some recent promising studies on the impact of fasting on mice with cancer. Human studies, however, are still lacking.\""]}]}}
