In 1819 he was ordained and became chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford.  A scholar of the Welsh language, he was closely associated with both Lady Charlotte Guest and Lady Llanover.  He was also a Hebrew scholar, publishing a translation of the Book of Isaiah in 1830. Tegid won a cup at the Cardiff Eeisteddfod of 1834. In 1842 he moved to Nevern in Pembrokeshire and in 1848 became a canon at St Davids Cathedral. His poetry was published posthumously, in collected form, with a very short biography, by his sister's son the Rev. Henry Roberts, in 1859.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion", "response": ["The Society's revival in 1820 was linked to attempts in Wales to establish a National Eisteddfod under the auspices of four provincial Cambrian Societies (for Dyfed, Gwynedd, Gwent and Powys), and the perceived need for a central organisation to oversee their activities. Its formal title was therefore the Cymmrodorion Society or the Metropolitan Cambrian Institution. Those active in the revival included John Jenkins, Walter Davies, W. J. Rees and Richard Edmunds. The Society's Presidents included Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet (son of the second Chief President of the first society) and the 2nd Earl of Powis. Others officers included John Parry (\"Bardd Alaw\") as Registrar of Music, Henry Davies as Librarian, and John Jones (\"Ioan Tegid\") as \"Welsh Correspondent\". The Society published Welsh texts, awarded medals, and otherwise supported Welsh culture."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh writers", "response": ["*John Jones (Jac Glan-y-gors, 1766\u20131821, W), satirical poet and pamphleteer"]}, {"page": "1792 in poetry", "response": ["* February 10 \u2013 Ioan Tegid (John Jones, died 1852), Welsh clergyman, scholar and poet"]}, {"page": "Ioan", "response": ["* Ioan Tegid (John Jones), poet"]}, {"page": "List of clergy educated at Jesus College, Oxford", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|1808John Jones (archdeacon)"]}]}}
