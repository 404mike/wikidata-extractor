He played keyboards and sang, performing on almost every Pink Floyd album and playing on all their tours.Wright grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex and met future Pink Floyd bandmates Roger Waters and Nick Mason while studying architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic, London. After being joined by frontman and songwriter Syd Barrett, the group found commercial success in 1967. Barrett was replaced by David Gilmour in 1968, who, along with Waters and Wright, took over songwriting.\nInitially contributing more as a singer/songwriter, Wright later acted mainly as an arranger on compositions by Waters and Gilmour. He began to contribute less towards the end of the 1970s and left the band after touring The Wall in 1981. He rejoined as a session player in 1987 for A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and rejoined full-time for The Division Bell in 1994. Sessions with Wright during this period were later released on the 2014 album The Endless River. Away from Pink Floyd, Wright recorded two solo albums and was briefly active in the pop duo Zee with Dave Harris of Fashion. Following Pink Floyd's Live 8 appearance in 2005, he became part of Gilmour's touring band, singing occasional lead vocals on songs such as \"Arnold Layne\", before his death in September 2008.\nWright's jazz influences and distinctive keyboard playing were an important part of the Pink Floyd sound. As well as playing Farfisa and Hammond organs and Kurzweil synthesisers, he sang regularly in the band and took lead vocals on songs such as \"Remember a Day\" (1968), \"Time\" (1973) and \"Wearing the Inside Out\" (1994).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 28", "response": ["*  1943   \u2013 Richard Wright, English singer-songwriter and keyboard player (d. 2008)"]}, {"page": "September 15", "response": ["*  2008   \u2013 Richard Wright, English singer-songwriter and keyboard player (b. 1943)"]}, {"page": "1943", "response": ["** Richard Wright, British musician (d. 2008)"]}, {"page": "2008", "response": ["* September 15 \u2013 Richard Wright, English keyboardist (b. 1943)"]}, {"page": "The Dark Side of the Moon", "response": ["A concept album, The Dark Side of the Moon explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design, representing the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\".", "For the most part, all four members approved of Waters' concept for an album unified by a single theme. Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright participated in the writing and production of the new material, and Waters created the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a small studio built in his garden shed. Parts of the album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of \"Breathe\" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and the basic structure of \"Us and Them\" was borrowed from an original composition, \"The Violent Sequence\" by Wright for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by the Rolling Stones, and then at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). However, after discovering that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material premiered at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.", "Several tracks, including \"Us and Them\" and \"Time\", demonstrated Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's ability to harmonise their voices.  In the 2003 Classic Albums documentary The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon, Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons used studio techniques such as the double tracking of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself.  The engineer also made prominent use of flanging and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the quadraphonic mix of \"On the Run\", when the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker rapidly swirls around the listener).", "The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie.  Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something \"smarter, neater more classy\". The design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a colour beam projected through it that Thorgerson had found in a photography book.", "The success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project.  Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it.  But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\"", "* Richard Wright\u00a0\u2013 organ (Hammond and Farfisa), piano, electric piano (Wurlitzer, Rhodes), EMS VCS 3, Synthi AKS, vocals", "Category:Albums produced by Richard Wright (musician)"]}, {"page": "Hatch End", "response": ["* Richard Wright, English pianist, keyboardist, singer and songwriter best known for his career with Pink Floyd grew up in Hatch End."]}, {"page": "Synth-pop", "response": ["Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s, around the same time as rock music began to emerge as a distinct musical genre.

He also stood in for keyboardist Richard Wright, who had left the band under pressure from Waters during the recording of The Wall. James Guthrie was studio engineer and co-producer, while Mason's drumming was supplemented by Ray Cooper on percussion; when Mason was unable to perform the complex time changes on \"Two Suns in the Sunset\", he was replaced by Andy Newmark. Mason also suggested the repeated reprises of \"Maggie, what have we done\" be rendered instrumental rather than sung. Raphael Ravenscroft was hired to play the saxophone. Recording took place in the latter half of 1982 across eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at Hookend Manor, and Waters' Billiard Room Studios at East Sheen. The other venues were Mayfair Studios, Olympic Studios, Abbey Road Studios, Eel Pie Studios, Audio International and RAK Studios."]}]}}
