Fowler made his debut replacing Tommy Gallogley at inside right on 17 December 1921, scoring in a 4\u20130 victory over Southend United. He retained his place for the next three games before Gallogley returned on New Year's Eve. Plymouth finished the season as runners-up in the Third Division South to Southampton, but with only one team being promoted missed out on promotion on goal average. This was the start of a run of six consecutive seasons in which Plymouth finished as runners-up but were denied promotion."]}]}}
