In January 1928 he reported what is now known as Griffith's Experiment, the first widely accepted demonstrations of bacterial transformation, whereby a bacterium distinctly changes its form and function.He showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae, implicated in many cases of lobar pneumonia, could transform from one strain into a different strain. The observation was attributed to an unidentified transforming principle or transforming factor. This was later identified as DNA.\nAmerica's leading pneumococcal researcher, Oswald T. Avery, speculated that Griffith had failed to apply adequate controls. A cautious and thorough researcher, and a reticent individual, Griffith's tendency was to publish only findings that he believed truly significant, and Griffith's findings were rapidly confirmed by researchers in Avery's laboratory. His discovery was one of the first to show the central role of DNA in heredity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "DNA", "response": ["* In 1934, Koltsov contended that the proteins that contain a cell's genetic information replicate.

Sixteen years later, in 1944, the Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment identified DNA as the molecule responsible for transformation.

He had received emeritus status from the Rockefeller Institute in 1943, but continued working for five years, though by that time he was in his late sixties. Techniques were available to remove various organic compounds from bacteria, and if the remaining organic compounds were still able to cause R strain bacteria to transform then the substances removed could not be the carrier of genes. S-bacteria first had the large cellular structures removed. Then they were treated with protease enzymes, which removed the proteins from the cells before the remainder was placed with R strain bacteria. The R strain bacteria transformed, meaning that proteins did not carry the genes causing disease. Then the remnants of the S strain bacteria were treated with a deoxyribonuclease enzyme which removed the DNA. After this treatment, the R strain bacteria no longer transformed.  This showed that DNA was the substance that transformed R strain into S strain bacteria and indicated that it was the carrier of genes in cells."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Frederick Griffith (1879\u20131941), British bacteriologist who studied the epidemiology and pathology of bacterial pneumonia"]}, {"page": "Horizontal gene transfer", "response": ["Griffith's experiment, reported in 1928 by Frederick Griffith, was the first experiment suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation.

Griffith was interested in determining whether injections of heat-killed bacteria could be used to vaccinate mice against pneumonia.  However, he discovered that a non-virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae could be made virulent after being exposed to heat-killed virulent strains. Griffith hypothesized that some \"transforming principle\" from the heat-killed strain was responsible for making the harmless strain virulent. In 1944 this \"transforming principle\" was identified as being genetic by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty. They isolated DNA from a virulent strain of S. pneumoniae and using just this DNA were able to make a harmless strain virulent. They called this uptake and incorporation of DNA by bacteria \"transformation\" (See Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment)Case, Christine; Funke, Berdell; Tortora, Gerard.

Blood serum containing the antibodies can then be extracted and applied to cultured bacteria.  The antibodies will react with other bacteria of the same type as the original inoculation. Fred Neufeld, a German bacteriologist, had discovered the pneumococcal types and serological typing; until Frederick Griffith's studies bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable from one generation to the next.Lehrer, Steven.
