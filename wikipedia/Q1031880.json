Gorbachev rejected these claims, invoking Article 78 of the Soviet Constitution, which stated that republics' borders could not be altered without their prior consent. The vote by the Council and the subsequent protests were condemned also by the state-run Soviet media; however, they resonated more loudly among Azerbaijanis. As journalist Thomas de Waal wrote in his 2003 book on the conflict, after the appeal of the Council \"the slow descent into armed conflict began on the first day.\"", "On February 26, several minor rallies were held at Lenin Square in Sumgait. Explicit calls for violence against Armenians and for their expulsion from Azerbaijan were heard and the crowds were agitated by news of Azerbaijani refugees who had fled Armenia (from the towns Kapan and Masis). Certain individuals told stories of murders and violence purportedly carried out by Armenians against the Azerbaijanis. Soviet authorities would later cast these individuals as agents provocateur. One individual, according to the Soviet press, was later revealed not to be a resident of Kapan, as he had claimed, but a criminal with a prior arrest record. Zardusht Alizadeh, who was active in the social and political life of Azerbaijan from 1988\u20131989 and was one of the founders of Azerbaijani Popular Front, visited Sumgait ten days after the pogrom and met with the workers from the aluminum factory, and reported that locals said that people from out of town had been inciting the violence.

In an article that appeared in the Azerbaijani journal Elm, Bunyadov claimed that Armenians had organized the pogroms: \"The Sumgait tragedy was carefully prepared by Armenian nationalists...

London: Zed Books, 1994, pp. 188\u2013189. . Bunyadov's thesis was hinged on the fact that Sumgait Armenians had withdrawn more than one million rubles from their savings before the attacks. To support his thesis, he had also drawn attention to the fact that one of the participants in the riots and killings was Eduard Grigorian, a man of mixed Russian-Armenian lineage who was freed after while later in Russia, and who had three previous criminal convictions and pretended to be Azerbaijani. Grigorian was a factory worker who took part in gang rapes and mass attacks and was subsequently sentenced to 12 years for his role in the massacres. Grigorian had been brought up in Sumgait by his Russian mother following the early death of his Armenian father, and his ethnic identity is considered irrelevant since he appropriately fit the profile of a \"pogromshchik, a thuggish young man, of indeterminate nationality with a criminal past, seeking violence for its own sake.\" This view has since gained wider currency in all of Azerbaijan today, where it is still euphemistically referred to in the media and by government officials as the \"Sumgait events\" (Sumqay\u0131t hadis\u0259l\u0259ri).See, for example, Jamil Babayeva, \"Armenia's provocation: Sumgayit events .

In its official statements, Russia calls for a peaceful settlement and restraint during skirmishes. British journalist Thomas de Waal has argued that there is an Azerbaijani narrative that Russia has \"consistently supported the Armenian side.\" According to de Waal, Russia \"has more supported the Armenian side,\" but there have been various \"different Russian actors at different times supporting both sides in this conflict.\" He argues that President Boris Yeltsin did not \"want to see the Armenian side be defeated, but he also didn't want to supply them with too many weapons.\" De Waal concluded in 2012 that \"Russia [is] playing both sides\", but \"ultimately more in the Armenian side.\" Other commentators have argued that Russia plays both sides in the conflict.Interview with Gerard Toal.  Svante Cornell argued in 2018 that Russia \"had been playing both sides of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict to gain maximum control over both, a policy that continues to this day.\""]}, {"page": "European Association of History Educators", "response": ["* Thomas de Waal, Historian, Senior associate in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment"]}, {"page": "Samvel Babayan", "response": ["Babayan was born on 5 March 1965 in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan SSR. In 1982, he finished Armenian secondary school #7 named after Yeghishe Charents in Stepanakert. From 1983 to 1985, he served in the Soviet military contingent in East Germany. According to Thomas de Waal, Babayan made his living as a garage mechanic and car-washer and also worked at a caf\u00e9 before the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. ", "Samvel Babayan established himself as the most powerful man in Nagorno-Karabakh in the aftermath of the war. According to Thomas de Waal, Babayan acquired significant wealth by selling materials taken from the Azerbaijani districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and by establishing a monopoly over cigarette and fuel imports to Nagorno-Karabakh through a company registered in his wife's name. Babayan used his position to acquire land, businesses and tax privileges. After Nagorno-Karabakh's president Robert Kocharyan left his position to become prime minister of Armenia, Babayan became even more influential in Karabakh's civilian politics. In June 1998, he forced Nagorno-Karabakh's prime minister Leonard Petrosyan to resign. At a joint session of the security councils of Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in January 1998, at the urging of Vazgen Sargsyan, Robert Kocharyan, and Serzh Sargsyan, Babayan spoke strongly against President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan's plan to accept the OSCE Minsk Group's proposals to return some of the territory captured from Azerbaijan during the war and deploy international peacekeepers there; Ter-Petrosyan was forced to resign a month later. Babayan then began to intervene in Armenian politics, funding the \"Law and Unity\" bloc in the 1999 Armenian parliamentary election, where the bloc came in third. After this, Armenia's prime minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Robert Kocharyan (now president of Armenia) decided to restrain Babayan's growing influence."]}]}}
