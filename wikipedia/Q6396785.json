However, Brown was unable to match Burley's ability to bring in quality players on a restricted budget, and was further weakened when Grzegorz Rasiak was sold under his nose to Tottenham Hotspur on the last day of the August Transfer Window, not giving him time to bring in a replacement. Brown needed a wise head with him as assistant but instead selected Dean Holdsworth, with no experience in the role, as his support and built a side constantly in flux; 22 Derby players made their debut during the 2005\u201306 season many of whom were \"ineffective\" loanees, such as Stern John, Khalilou Fadiga and Johnnie Jackson. A poor start, just 3 wins from 20 matches, put any hopes of a repeat of the previous campaign to bed and Brown was under intense pressure almost straight away. The sale of Marcus Tudgay to Sheffield Wednesday, to raise funds for the capture of Darren Moore to strengthen the defence, left the club with just one recognised striker, 35-year-old Paul Peschisolido, and, after just 33 games in charge, Brown was sacked as Derby manager after a 6\u20131 defeat at Coventry City was followed by an embarrassing 3\u20131 FA Cup exit to League One side Colchester United. He was replaced by Academy Coach Terry Westley who made key captures in Alan Wright, Kevin Lisbie and Michael McIndoe as well as introduced youngsters such as Lewin Nyatanga and Giles Barnes into regular first team action.
