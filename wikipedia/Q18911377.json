As one of his friends and contemporaries put it: \"Many a popular drawing-room song of those days bore on its title-page the intimation, ' Words by Thomas Oliphant, Esq.' Tom knew no German, and when he was told of a song in that noble tongue which was likely to suit him commercially, he asked me to give him a bare English prose translation of it, which he then turned into metre..... 'The Standard-Bearer' was one of the most successful of the many prose-skeleton songs of which I thus furnished him.\"Literary recollections and sketches by Francis Espinasse Given the quantity of \"translations\" which Oliphant produced, it is hard to see how he could not have gained some knowledge of German in the process. Oliphant also drew from Welsh, French, Italian and other languages, it is possible that he was not fully conversant in these languages either (nevertheless it is known from his collection of Italian sketches, that he did at some stage travel in Italy), which is probably partly why his English verses are not translations but his own interpretations. \"Nos Gallen\" is a notable example, since it is a New Year's Eve song, which Oliphant turned into the Christmas carol \"Deck the Hall\" (although he published it as \"Nos Gallen\" in 1862 and it has since become known by its first line)."]}, {"page": "Great Writers series", "response": ["||1892||Voltaire||Francis EspinasseJohn Rylands Library page|| ", "||1895||Ernest Renan||Francis Espinasse||"]}, {"page": "Herodotus Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Espinasse"]}, {"page": "Lucian Paul", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Espinasse"]}, {"page": "Frank Grave", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Espinasse"]}]}}
