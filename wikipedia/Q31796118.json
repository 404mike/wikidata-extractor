He was born at Rodney Stoke in Somerset and died at Harrow, Middlesex.\nTremlett was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge. He played cricket at Eton and featured in the annual Eton v Harrow match in three seasons from 1850 to 1852. In these games, and then later at Cambridge, he batted anywhere in the batting order from opening the innings to being the No 11, and he also took wickets; however, there is no record of whether he batted right- or left-handed or of his bowling style. His best score in his four first-class games came in his first match: an innings of 28 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. In 1854, his three matches included the University Match against Oxford University, and he is therefore recorded as having achieved a Blue. The game was his final first-class appearance.\nTremlett graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1857, and this was automatically converted to a Master of Arts in 1860. He became a Fellow of King's College until he disqualified himself by marrying in 1873; he also became a lawyer at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1861.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tremlett", "response": ["*Thomas Tremlett (1834\u20131894), English cricketer and lawyer"]}, {"page": "Tremlett, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Tremlett"]}]}}
