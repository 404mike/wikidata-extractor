Born in Lonmay in Aberdeenshire, he started his career in Cullen, Moray, then moved to Elgin around 1821, where he practised for the rest of his life. He established himself as the foremost architect of his period north of Aberdeen, described by Charles McKean as \"possibly the north of Scotland's first native classical architect of substance.\" His practice was continued by his nephews Alexander and William Reid, and then by their partners and successors J and W Wittet.\nRobertson built numerous churches, for the Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church of Scotland and for the newly emancipated Roman Catholic Church, including the Category A listed St Thomas's in Keith, which he designed with Walter Lovi.  He also improved numerous country houses around Morayshire and Banffshire, such as Milton Brodie House, and he built Aberlour House from scratch, for the rich slave-owner and planter Alexander Grant. In 1826, he published a book, entitled A Series of Views of the Ruins of Elgin Cathedral \u2026 with ground plan and table of measurements.He died at Elgin on 12 June 1841, and is commemorated by a memorial in the graveyard at Elgin Cathedral.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Robertson", "response": ["*William Robertson (Western Quebec and Upper Canada) (c. 1760\u20131806), Scottish-born entrepreneur and colonial-era political figure", "*William Robertson (Nova Scotia), Scottish-descended merchant and political figure in Canadian colonies ", "*William Robertson (Australian politician) (1839\u20131892), barrister and politician in colonial Victoria, Australia", "*William Robertson (Ontario) (1897\u20131948), Canadian politician in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario", "*William Robertson, Lord Robertson (1753\u20131853), Scottish lawyer", "*William Robertson (Welsh footballer) (1873\u2013after 1903), Welsh inside-forward", "*William Robertson (Scottish footballer) (1907\u20131980), Scottish full back with Stoke City, Manchester United and Reading", "*William Robertson (1880s footballer) (fl. 1887), Scottish footballer", "*William Robertson (Canterbury  cricketer) (1864\u20131912), New Zealand cricketer, played for Canterbury 1894\u20131901", "*William Robertson (Otago cricketer) (born 1940), New Zealand cricketer, played for Otago 1960\u201361", "*William Robertson (MCC cricketer) (William Parish Robertson, 1879\u20131950), English cricketer, played for Middlesex County Cricket Club (MCC) 1900\u201319", "*William Robertson (Jersey cricketer) (born 1998), English cricketer who plays for Jersey", "*Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet (1860\u20131933), British Army officer", "*William Robertson (VC) (1865\u20131949), Scottish sergeant-major and Victoria Cross recipient", "*William Robertson (died 1914), of Robertson brothers (pastoralists), pioneers of South Australia", "*William Robertson (Australian settler) (1798\u20131874), Scottish-born pioneer in Tasmania and Victoria", "*William Robertson (Hebraist) (fl. 1650\u20131680), Scottish Hebraist", "*William Robertson (historian) (1721\u20131793), Scottish writer and academic", "*William Robertson (Irish architect) (1770-1850), Irish architect with Scottish roots", "*William Robertson (architect) (1786\u20131841), Scottish architect", "*William Robertson (Irish priest) (1705\u20131783), Irish clergyman, theological writer and schoolmaster", "*William Robertson (antiquary) (1740\u20131803), Scottish historian and antiquary", "*William Robertson (statistician) (1818\u20131882), Scottish physician, statistician and amateur photographer"]}, {"page": "Gardenstown", "response": ["A church was built in 1830, the work of William Robertson, replacing the old church of St John, and the parish of Gardenstown was separated from Gamrie on 16 March 1885.

He chose a site on Malcolm Street and, again working with William Robertson, built St Joachim's Church, which opened in 1836 and is still in use as an active place of worship. St Joachim's, so named because the feast day of St Joachim falls within the fishing season, was designated a Category B listed building in 1979.

The construction was paid for using money collected by Lovi on a European fund-raising trip, during which Charles X, the King of France, donated the painting by Dubois of St Thomas, which forms the altarpiece.

Originally from Drumfurrich Farm in Aberlour parish, he had travelled to Jamaica, where he amassed a considerable fortune as a planter and merchant. He was a slave owner, and a member of the Jamaican legislature. It is not certain when he returned to Britain, but it is thought that he was in London by the 1820s, and he visited Aberlour in 1829 to attend to the burial of his father, the farmer George Grant. When slavery was abolished in 1833, Grant benefitted from a government scheme to compensate slave owners, claiming over \u00a324,000 for the loss of his slaves and other business assets. He commissioned the architect William Robertson to build Aberlour House for him, which was completed in 1838. He also had plans to buy the farm on which he was born.

On the western flank, there is a bay window, and behind that a large single-storey wing; on the east side, there is a two-storey, three-bay drawing room extension, continuous with the main frontage, similar in style to the original front but resulting in an asymmetrical appearance that Walker and Woodworth describe as being out of character with Robertson's work.", "Aberlour House was built between 1838 and 1839 by William Robertson, for the slave owner, planter and merchant Alexander Grant, who had been born near Aberlour but had travelled to Jamaica where he had made a substantial fortune before to returning to the UK at some point in the 1820s.

This work was conducted by A & W Reid, nephews of William Robertson, who continued his Elgin practice after his death in 1841.

There were walled courts lined with flower borders, roses and fruit trees, and a classical arrangement of rectangular plots laid out symmetrically on either side of an avenue. Thomas White, a landscape architect from Nottinghamshire, drew up plans for new and extensive landscaped gardens in 1789, although these were only partially executed. Between 1820 and 1830, Lewis Grant-Ogilvy, 5th Earl of Seafield extended the gardens considerably by demolishing the entire village of Cullen, and building a new planned town for its inhabitants, laid out by George MacWilliam with alterations by Peter Brown and William Robertson, nearer the coast. The only remaining building from the original village is Cullen Old Church. Later in the nineteenth century, the Great North of Scotland Railway hoped to cut through the house's grounds, but the earl refused his permission, forcing the company to build a viaduct,  long and  high, through the town of Cullen itself; the line was eventually opened in 1886.", "On a hilltop at the north end of the grounds there is a garden feature in the form of a Grecian temple pavilion made of polished ashlar. An open rotunda with a leaded roof and a plasterwork ceiling is supported by eight Ionic columns, which sit atop the walls of a round basement tearoom. There was originally a statue depicting either Pomona or Pheme at the centre of the rotunda. The tearoom has a round-arched doorway, flanked by matching windows. It was constructed in 1822 by William Robertson, following 1788 original designs by James Playfair which are still in the Seafield estate's archives. The statue was lost between 1939 and 1945, and the floor of the rotunda has collapsed; the round pediment of the statue now lies in the centre of the ruined tearoom.

There were three sash windows on the first floor of the hall block and a crenellated parapet at roof level. To the right of the hall block, there was a three-stage tower with a round-headed doorway on the ground floor, a mullioned window with tracery in the second stage and a clock in the third stage. Above the tower there was a parapet with corbelled corner turrets and a spire on an octagonal base. Its design was similar to that of William Robertson's tolbooth in Forres, and its tower and spire were inspired by 16th-century Scots tollbooths.
