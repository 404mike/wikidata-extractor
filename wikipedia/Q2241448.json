It is the band's third major release, and first with pipe player Cillian Vallely. The record is characterised as particularly rhythm-heavy and showcasing the band experimenting more with rhythm and sound than on previous records, and features numerous instruments atypical to Celtic music, such as lap steel guitar, piano, harmonium and clarinet, played by a number of guest musicians. Rhythm, melody and strings vary as the foreground of the music, which largely consists of Irish tunes.", "Prior to releasing Otherworld, but after recording it, Cillian Vallely joined the band on uilleann pipes and whistle, marking a permanent replacement for Michael McGoldrick and John McSherry who both left the band in 1998 after the band's first album, but returned to reprise their roles as guests on Otherworld. Crawford said \"We did a few gigs with Mike and John dividing the piping, and as the year progressed, Mike did more piping gigs than John. But we needed someone who could commit all of their time. We needed a full-time piper and there's where Cillian came on board.\" Vallely said \"it was great to get the call to play with the lads, as I knew my natural piping style would fit in with what they were doing. It was music I liked and I understood where it was coming from in terms of the influences.\" The band soon began \"to work on new music and arrangements for the new line up, and the band's third album marked Vallely's recording debut with the band.", "Besides the aforementioned inclusion of unusual instruments, the record is characterised by presenting \"a softer touch\" by the \"fully confident\" band, as opposed to Otherworld which \"sparkled with all the energy of L\u00fanasa\u2019s live performances.\" The Irish Times said the album bears \"fruit of every texture and hue\".

According to one biography, Vallely was \"the perfect fit for this adventurous undertaking\" due to having composed both traditional and classical compositions. Vallely suggested Celtic folk group L\u00fanasa, which features his brother Cillian Vallely on pipes, for the project, and the project subsequently evolved into L\u00fanasa playing with the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra, conducted by David Brophy, creating an unusual fusion between traditional and classical music. One biography noted that the collaboration allowed Niall to expand L\u00fanasa's \"innovative use of harmony and rhythm,\" taking advantage of the harmonic and rhythmic potential of \"the full orchestral sound. The result is truly a new sound in Irish music.\""]}]}}
