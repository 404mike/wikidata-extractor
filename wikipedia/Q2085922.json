He used the French name La Pie-Griesche de Canada and the Latin name Lanius Canadensis. The two stars (**) at the start of the paragraph indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson in his Ornithologie. One of these was the black-crested antshrike. Linnaeus included a brief description, used the binomial name Lanius canadensis and cited Brisson's work.

His grandfather Fran\u00e7ois Haverschmidt wroter under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. As a young boy he was part of a birdwatchers group along with his friend Jan Verwey (1899-1981). In 1924 he became a member of the Nederlandsche Ornithologische Vereeniging and published his first article in the journal Ardea in 1925. He studied law in the University of Utrecht and worked as a clerk in the courts of Utrecht, Haarlem (1936-1938), Heerlen (1938-1941) and Leeuwarden (1941-1946) before moving to Paramaribo, Suriname as a judge. While serving in Suriname, he found that despite work done by the Penard brothers and Charles Chubb, there were great gaps in knowledge. So he began to make collections and sent them to museums, initially to John Todd Zimmer at the American Museum of Natural History but after Zimmer's death in 1957, he sent specimens to Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden. He sent nearly 9800 specimens over his lifetime. He also began to put together his notes and this resulted in the 1968 book, The Birds of Surinam with art by Paul Barruel. It was revised by Gerlof Fokko Mees in 1994. Haverschmidt became chief justice of the Supreme Court and served as interim governor of Suriname on three occasions. For his service he was made Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion and Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau."]}]}}
