He also served as an MLA for West Tyrone in the first session of the Assembly. He was a former teacher and was an officer in the Ulster Defence Regiment. His niece, Esther Gibson, was one of the 29 victims killed in the 1998 Omagh bombing.In 1999, David Jordan, a former Ulster Defence Regiment soldier, broke down in a bar and claimed to be part of a patrol that killed a nationalist councillor, Patsy Kelly, in 1974. Jordan reportedly implicated Gibson in the murder. Jordan was never formally questioned in relation to the matter and no charges were ever brought against Gibson.In 2003, it emerged that Gibson was having an affair with his 35-year-old secretary Audrey McKenzie and was living with her in Ballybogy, County Antrim. His wife confirmed that he had left her and was no longer living in their Sixmilecross home. He retired as a councillor in Omagh District Council shortly afterwards.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Oliver Gibson", "|Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|Oliver Gibson", "|Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "West Tyrone (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=2|Oliver Gibson(DUP)", "| align=\"right\" |Oliver GibsonThomas Kerrigan"]}, {"page": "2001 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "1997 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "1993 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "1989 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "1985 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "1981 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Oliver Gibson"]}, {"page": "Gibson, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Gibson"]}]}}
