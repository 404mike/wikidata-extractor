Kenney attracted the attention of the press and public in 1905 when she and Christabel Pankhurst were imprisoned for several days for assault and obstruction, after questioning Sir Edward Grey at a Liberal rally in Manchester on the issue of votes for women. The incident is credited with inaugurating a new phase in the struggle for women's suffrage in the UK, with the adoption of militant tactics.

She and Christabel went on holiday to Sark together, and some sources suggest the relationship was platonic rather than romantic. Annie was a family friend of the Blathwayts. She was a frequent visitor to Eagle House, and unlike everyone else she planted four trees. The Blaythwaits paid for presents and watches, and paid her medical and dentistry bills for both her and her sisters. Mary Blathwayt made notes in her diary of the women Kenney slept with when she stayed at the Blathwayt's home, Eagle House. Blathwayt's romantic jealousy has been proposed as a reason.

Howey's violent tactics were criticised by some other members of the WSPU who called for her removal from the union. The actions proved too much for Mary Blathwayt's family. Her mother, Emily, resigned from the WSPU and her father, Linley, wrote letters of protest to Christabel Pankhurst, Howey and Wentworth.
