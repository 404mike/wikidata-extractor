Acen was known for tracks such as \"Close Your Eyes\", \"Window in the Sky\" and \"Trip II the Moon\" (the latter two both 1992). He worked for the Production House Records stable, which also brought fame to Baby D. He released the album 75 Minutes.He has also collaborated with Baby D's Floyd Dyce to form The House Crew.He is now a filmmaker, specialising in short films under the name Acen Films Limited to be shown at festivals. Besides producing dance music tracks, his aim is to fuse art forms and to introduce pioneering visual and musical perceptions to new audiences.In 1999, Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger described Razvi as \"the most underrated act of the decade\": \"His series of 12\u2033 singles, tossed out into the seething dance marketplace of \u201992\u2013\u201993, are without exception stunning. Acen is the lushest, and most lyrical, of the great hardcore producers, and if his gleeful inventiveness and wicked way with a sample are more typical of the time, that just goes to show what an unbelievable time it was. More than anyone else making records, Acen for me encompasses the beauty, velocity and freedom of hardcore.\" In his list of the \"Top 100 Singles of the 90s\", \"Trip II the Moon (Part 2)\" was ranked at number 23 and \"Close Your Eyes (Optikonfusion!)\" was ranked at number 44, while \"Window in the Sky\" almost featured on the list.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Acen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Acen Razvi"]}, {"page": "75 Minutes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Acen Razvi"]}, {"page": "Love (image)", "response": ["The image has been rendered and parodied in many forms. After the 1965 MoMA card, one of the early commercial uses of the image was on the LP cover of the 1967 studio recording of Olivier Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony, featuring the Toronto Symphony Orchestra conducted by Seiji Ozawa (RCA LSC-7051). The original book cover for Erich Segal's 1970 novel Love Story alluded to the design, and the TV series Bridget Loves Bernie included a shot of the Sixth Avenue sculpture in its opening credits. The first opening sequence of the Skip Beat! anime includes the image in the initial frames. The United States Post Office issued an eight-cent stamp in 1973 featuring the image. Parodies of the image appeared on covers of records by Rage Against the Machine (Renegades), Oasis (\"Little by Little\" single) and Acen Razvi (75 Minutes). London artist D*Face parodied the image by rendering the word \"hate\" with the \"A\" tilted and Belgian artist Eddy Gabriel made a version using the word \"lost\". The sculpture is remade to read \"THPS\" in the Xbox expansion of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, which has a stage set in Philadelphia's Love Park. The set reappears in Tony Hawk's Underground 2 and Tony Hawk's Proving Ground."]}, {"page": "Numbers Lucent", "response": ["The cover artwork is in a similar vein to that of his previous release, Just a Souvenir, but the tracks featured here are much more uptempo and energetic, and are aimed at the dance floor as much as the home listener. There is a strong early 1990s rave feel to many of the tracks, and most feature samples from early rave tunes by artists such as Rhythm Section (Rennie Pilgrem and Ellis Dee), Acen Razvi and The Prodigy, combined with Squarepusher's trademark glitchy jazz sound."]}, {"page": "Licka", "response": ["Licka is an EP released by artist Acen Razvi in 2002."]}, {"page": "Trip II the Moon", "response": ["\"Trip II the Moon\" also known as \"Trip II the Moon (Part 1)\" is a 1992 single by breakbeat hardcore musician Acen Razvi.
