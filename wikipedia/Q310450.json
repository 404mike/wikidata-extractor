He is best known for dominating the sport during the 1980s, when he reached eight World Snooker Championship finals in nine years, won six world titles, and held the world number one ranking for seven consecutive seasons. The first player to make an officially recognised maximum break in professional competition, and the first to earn \u00a31 million in career prize money, he famously was runner-up to Dennis Taylor in one of the sport's most memorable matches, the 1985 World Snooker Championship final. Its dramatic black-ball conclusion attracted 18.5 million viewers, setting UK records for any broadcast after midnight and any broadcast on BBC Two that still stand to this day. Named the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year in 1988, he remains the only snooker player to win the award.\nIn addition to his six world titles, Davis won the UK Championship six times and the Masters three times for a total of 15 Triple Crown titles, placing him third on the all-time list behind Ronnie O'Sullivan (20) and Stephen Hendry (18). During the 1987\u201388 season, he became the first player to win all three Triple Crown events in a single season, a feat that only Hendry and Mark Williams have since emulated. His career total of 28 ranking titles places him fourth on the all-time list behind O'Sullivan (38), Hendry (36), and John Higgins (31). He won his last major title at the 1997 Masters, but competed at a high level into his 50s, making the last of his record 30 Crucible appearances in 2010, when he defeated the defending world champion John Higgins to become the oldest world quarter-finalist since 1983. He retired from professional competition in April 2016, after 38 seasons, but he remains active as a commentator and analyst for the BBC's snooker coverage.\nOutside snooker, Davis competed in nine-ball pool tournaments, most notably representing Europe in the Mosconi Cup eleven times between 1994 and 2004. He defeated Earl Strickland in 2002 to clinch the cup for Europe, ending six years of American dominance. He also reached the final at an event on the World Pool League, and the last 16 of the 2003 WPA World Nine-ball Championship. A keen chess and poker player, he served as president of the British Chess Federation between 1996 and 2001 and has competed in televised poker tournaments. A fan of progressive rock, he has an ongoing career as a radio broadcaster, club DJ, and musician; with Kavus Torabi and Michael J. York, he co-founded the electronic music band The Utopia Strong. He has authored or co-authored books on snooker, chess, cooking, and music, as well as three autobiographies. In 2013, he featured as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! He was made a MBE in the 1988 Birthday Honours and an OBE in the 2000 New Year Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 22", "response": ["*1957 \u2013 Steve Davis, English snooker player, sportscaster, and author"]}, {"page": "England", "response": ["Darts is a widely popular sport in England; a professional competitive sport, darts is a traditional pub game.

Key figures in the game were Ray Reardon in the 1970s, Steve Davis in the 1980s, and Stephen Hendry in the 1990s, each winning the World Championship on multiple occasions.

In 1969, David Attenborough (then the controller of BBC2) commissioned the snooker tournament television series, Pot Black, primarily to showcase the potential of the BBC's new colour service, as the green table and multi-coloured balls provided an ideal opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of the new broadcasting technology. The series became a ratings success and was, for a time, the second-most popular show on BBC2 behind Morecambe and Wise. Interest in the game increased in the next decade and the 1978 World Snooker Championship was the first to receive daily television coverage. Snooker quickly became regarded as a mainstream game in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and much of the Commonwealth, and has remained consistently popular since the late 1970s, with most of the major tournaments being televised.
