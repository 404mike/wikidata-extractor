He was an Honorary Reader at the University of Manchester.After obtaining a 1st Class B.Sc. University College London in 1962, he completed his PhD on carpal bones in mammals at Royal Holloway College, under Prof. P. M. Butler, in 1965.  He then worked as an Assistant Lecturer, and eventually Senior Lecturer, at the University of Manchester, School of Biological Sciences, teaching vertebrate zoology. He retired from there in 2005, after 40 years' service.He was president of The Mammal Society from 1997 until his death, and edited their journal, Mammal Review from 1980\u20132002. He authored or co-authored over 200 scientific publications.Leptopelis yaldeni, (grassland forest tree frog, named by M. Largen in 1977), and Desmomys yaldeni (Yalden's desmomys, a rodent named by L. Lavrenchenko in 2003) are named in his honour. Both are endemic to Ethiopia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*2010: Dianne Edwards and Derek Yalden"]}, {"page": "Yalden's rat", "response": ["The rat got its name in honour of Derek Yalden, a zoologist."]}, {"page": "Leptopelis yaldeni", "response": ["Leptopelis yaldeni is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is endemic to Ethiopia and occurs in the montane highlands in Gojjam. Its range might be limited by the deep gorges of the Blue Nile. It is named in honour of Derek Yalden, a British zoologist who collected some of the types. Common names Yalden's tree frog and grassland forest treefrog have been coined for this species."]}, {"page": "Ethiopian hare", "response": ["The Ethiopian hare is a species of the family Leporidae, and has no recognized subspecies. It belongs to the subgenus Sabanalagus. It was first described in 1903 by the British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. He named it Lepus fagani, after Charles E. Fagan, who was the Assistant Secretary of the British Museum of Natural History. Describing the hare's taxonomy in 1986, Derek Yalden and colleagues wrote \"its nomenclatural history has been very confused\".", "In 1959 and 1964 respectively,  and A. A. Gureev classified it as a subspecies of L. crawhayi, now regarded as a junior synonym of L. microtis, the African savanna hare. In 1972,  and Derek Yalden suggested it might be a synonym of L. whytei, now a subspecies of L. microtis. Petter then classified it as a subspecies of the Abyssinian hare (Lepus habessinicus), in 1963. In 1987, Maria Luisa Azzaroli Puccetti reinstated its status as an independent species, because it has a uniform character throughout its distribution. It has been listed as a separate species in various works published since then. North of the Rift Valley, on the Ethiopian mountains, the population of the Ethiopian hare is geographically isolated  from that of the cape hare in the surrounding lowlands. Flux and Angermann suggested that this isolation in population probably lead to the evolution of the Ethiopian hare as a different species. In 1990, Flux and Angermann wrote it is \"probably\" a subspecies of the African savanna hare or of the scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis). It is usually considered to be a part of the African savanna hare-scrub hare complex. The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals also treats it as a subspecies of the cape hare (Lepus capensis). A genetic study suggests that the Ethiopian hare recently descended from the Abyssinian hare."]}, {"page": "Surbiton County Grammar School", "response": ["* Derek Yalden, Zoologist"]}, {"page": "Yalden", "response": ["* Derek Yalden, (1940\u20132013), English zoologist and honorary reader at the University of Manchester;"]}, {"page": "Peter Grubb (zoologist)", "response": ["*Obituary at the Mammal Society by Derek Yalden."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Derek Yalden, 72, zoologist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2013", "response": ["*Derek Yalden, 72, British zoologist.Derek Yalden has died, mammal.org.uk "]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Royal Holloway, University of London", "response": ["* Derek Yalden (1940\u20132013) English zoologist, reader at the University of Manchester"]}]}}
