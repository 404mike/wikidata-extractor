He was awarded a first class BSc degree in physics from Imperial College London in 1968 and a postgraduate MSc in astrophysics from Queen Mary College, University of London, in 1981. Corbyn was a member of the Labour Party and served as a councillor in the London Borough of Southwark from 1986 to 1990. He is the elder brother of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. He left Labour due to his opposition to the Iraq War.\nCorbyn ran a weather monitoring company called WeatherAction in the 1990s and gained some prominence in the media for his predictions and, later more so, for his rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, he has been a prominent proponent of conspiracy theories in the United Kingdom. He has described the virus as a \"hoax\", frequently campaigned against lockdowns and against COVID-19 vaccination, and falsely described COVID-19 vaccines as dangerous. He has been arrested on several occasions for taking part in protests against public health measures, and for calling for supporters to commit violent acts against Members of Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chippenham", "response": ["* Piers Corbyn, weather forecaster (brother of Jeremy), brought up nearby at Kington St Michael"]}, {"page": "Haberdashers' Adams", "response": ["*  Piers Corbyn (born 1947) \u2014 weather forecaster, businessman, activist, anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist"]}, {"page": "Jeremy Corbyn", "response": ["Corbyn was born on 26 May 1949\"Government and Opposition roles\" .
