He also played for Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1886 and 1887, which was before Warwickshire gained first-class status. He also played one Test match for England against Australia in 1890.\nAlthough he only played in that one Test, at the Oval at the end of the 1890 season, it was a low-scoring match, and his innings were important in England's two wicket victory, which saw them win the Ashes. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said of his innings that \"his defence under very trying conditions against the bowling of Turner and Ferris was masterly\". Cranston played no more Test cricket, and his career all but came to an end a year later after suffering a fit whilst playing the game, although he was able to return briefly eight years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "County Championship", "response": ["The first-ever official cricket County Championship match began on 12 May 1890: Yorkshire beat Gloucestershire by eight wickets at Bristol. James Cranston (Gloucestershire) scored the first century in the competition. The final positions in 1890 were based on number of wins minus the number of losses. Later, a points system was introduced but it has been subject to several variations."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["James Cranston \u00b7"]}, {"page": "List of monastic houses in Oxfordshire", "response": ["|secular cathedralfounded 634, new see of the West Saxons created;see transferred to Winchester 663see of Mercia 670s;see restored after 869 (875);see transferred to Lincoln 1072;secular canons collegiatefounded 1072: built on site of episcopal diocesan cathedral;dissolved c.1140 by Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln;Augustinian Canons Regular\u00a0\u2014 Arroasian (?)founded c.1140 by Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln;dissolved 1536; granted to Edmond Ashfield 1544/5;restored by James Cranston c.1845,William Butterfield 1846-53,and George Gilbert Scott 1859-74;church continues in parochial use as the Parish Church of SS Peter and Paul"]}, {"page": "Richard Hill (cricketer, born 1861)", "response": ["Hill bowled eight overs during the match, capturing one wicket, that of onetime Test player James Cranston."]}, {"page": "1890 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 798 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 34.69 || James Cranston || Gloucestershire"]}, {"page": "W.
