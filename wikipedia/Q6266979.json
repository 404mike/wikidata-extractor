During World War II he became Commanding officer of the 12th (Yorkshire) Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, serving as part of 5th Parachute Brigade of the 6th Airborne Division, during the Battle of Normandy. He and his division parachuted into Normandy in the early morning of 6 June 1944 as part of Operation Tonga. The 12th Battalion formed a defensive line south of the bridge at Ranville. On 6 and 7 June, the battalion defended the bridgehead against attacks by the German 21st Panzer Division moving north from Caen. Many casualties were caused by heavy fire from enemy machine guns, mortars, artillery, self-propelled guns, and tanks. For his leadership during this defensive stand, Johnson was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Order.\nIn the afternoon of 12 June, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was ordered to hastily prepare his battalion for an attack on the village of Br\u00e9ville (currently named Br\u00e9ville-les-Monts). At 21:45, the battalion assembled on the start line near Amfr\u00e9ville and an artillery barrage on enemy positions near Br\u00e9ville began. Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was conferring with a group of senior officers when he was killed by a stray artillery round. Also wounded by the blast were Brigadier Hugh Kindersley and Colonel Reginald Parker of 6th Airlanding Brigade and Brigadier The Lord Lovat of 1st Special Service Brigade.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "5th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)", "response": ["At the same time, the 3rd Parachute Brigade, supported by the 5th Battalion, Black Watch from the 51st (Highland) Division, were attempting to capture Breville, the only German held village on the high ground overlooking the British positions.Harclerode, pp.330\u2013331 By 12\u00a0June Breville was still in German hands, and Gale decided on one more attack, this time at night. This would be carried out by his only reserves; the 12th Parachute Battalion, now only 350 men strong, supported by the pathfinder company, a company from the 12th Devonshire Regiment, and a squadron of tanks from the 13th/18th Hussars. The attack would be supported by artillery fire from five regiments of artillery. The assault started at 22:00, and after fighting throughout the night the village was eventually captured. British casualties were heavy; the 12th Parachute Battalion lost 141 men, the Devons another 35.Saunders, p.188 The 12th Parachute Battalion was now reduced to only 55 men in its three rifle companies, plus the Headquarters Company. Some casualties were victims of the British artillery falling short. These included the 12th Parachute Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Johnny Johnson, who was killed.
