Lewis classified openings under the headings \"King's Bishop's Game\" (1.e4 e5 2.Bc4), \"King's Knight's Game\" (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3), \"Queen's Bishop's Pawn Game\" (1.e4 e5 2.c3), \"King's Gambit\" (1.e4 e5 2.f4), \"Queen's Gambit\" (1.d4 d5 2.c4) and \"Irregular Openings\" (all other openings). Lewis comments that the irregular openings are \"seldom played, because they are generally dull and uninteresting\". Among the openings he analyzes under this heading are the French Defence and English Opening (both now considered standard), Bird's Opening and a few 1.d4 d5 lines without the Queen's Gambit. Lewis assigns no names to these openings.William Lewis, Second Series of Lessons on the Game of Chess, Simpkin & Marshall, London 1832"]}, {"page": "Adolf Anderssen", "response": ["When Anderssen was nine years old, his father taught him how to play chess.

The first game with the opening is considered to be Evans\u2013McDonnell, London 1827, although in that game a slightly different move order was tried (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.0-0 d6 and only now 5.b4). In 1832, the first analysis of the gambit was published in the Second Series of Progressive Lessons (1832) by William Lewis.The British chess magazine, vol. 26 (1906) page 51. The gambit became very popular shortly after that, being employed a number of times in the series of games between McDonnell and Louis de la Bourdonnais in 1834. Players such as Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Mikhail Chigorin subsequently took it up. The Evergreen game won by Adolf Anderssen against Jean Dufresne opened with the Evans Gambit. Eventually however, the second World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker dealt a heavy blow to the opening with a modern defensive idea: returning the pawn under favourable circumstances. The opening was out of favour for much of the 20th century, although John Nunn and Jan Timman played some games with it in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in the 1990s Garry Kasparov used it in a few of his games (notably a famous 25-move win against Viswanathan Anand in Riga, 1995), which prompted a brief revival of interest in it."]}, {"page": "Mechanical Turk", "response": ["The Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by Johann Nepomuk M\u00e4lzel. The chess masters who secretly operated it included Johann Allgaier, Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger, but the operators within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain a mystery.", "The most important biographical history about the Chess-player and M\u00e4lzel was presented in The Book of the First American Chess Congress, published by Daniel Willard Fiske in 1857.

(obituary) In 1844 George Walker described Cochrane's approach to the game:\"Mr. Cochrane is the most brilliant player I have ever had the honour to look over or confront; not even excepting De la Bourdonnais; and pity it is that his very brilliancy so often mars success.\" Cochrane was also a well-known chess theoretician, although his innovations in the openings were generally unsound, and only he could get away with playing them."]}, {"page": "Bishop's Opening", "response": ["Black's most energetic response to the Philidor Variation is the Lewis Countergambit, 3.c3 d5, named for the English player and author William Lewis (1787\u20131870) who published analysis of the line in 1834."]}, {"page": "Alexandre Deschapelles", "response": ["He was the teacher of Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Mouret and later, , he accepted Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais as a student.
