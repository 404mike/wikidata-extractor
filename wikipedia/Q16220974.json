Formed in 2002, The Cribs have released eight albums to date, and numerous singles and EPs. As of 2016 their latest three records have charted in the UK top 10, alongside 7 top 40 singles. He has lived in Portland, Oregon, since 2006.\nThe band consists of his twin brother Ryan and his younger brother Ross. Gary is the most political member of The Cribs, and can regularly be heard in interviews criticizing inequality and misogyny in the music industry. This could be attributed to the fact that he spent a few years prior to the band's success, participating as part of the committee that put on the UK's first \"Ladyfest\" in London, and also numerous fundraisers around this time.\nIn 2009 he underwent surgery in the US to remove growths from his vocal cords.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music of Oregon", "response": ["*Gary Jarman of The Cribs"]}, {"page": "List of twins", "response": ["* Ryan and Gary Jarman (1980\u2013) members of The Cribs"]}, {"page": "Barnsley College", "response": ["* Gary Jarman, bassist of the indie rock group The Cribs studied music there, but failed to finish the course."]}, {"page": "The Cribs", "response": ["*Gary Jarman \u2013 bass, vocals (2001\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "The New Fellas", "response": ["All songs written by Ryan Jarman, Ross Jarman, and Gary Jarman"]}, {"page": "The Cribs (album)", "response": ["The band formed in 2001, and for the first few years of their existence, they played small gigs in local venues.
