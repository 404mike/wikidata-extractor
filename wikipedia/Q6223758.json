At this time, the Labour group was led by John Buckle, who resented the influence of the ILP.  In 1908, Buckle resigned in protest at the group refusing to meet with the King and Queen when they visited the city.  Badlay was elected as his replacement, and oversaw Buckle's expulsion from the party.  His time leading the group was, in retrospect, considered a success.  While his personal style has been criticised by Michael Meadowcroft as \"somewhat theatrical\", he has also been praised for maintaining his radicalism and, on one occasion, speaking non-stop for three hours in opposition to a Conservative Party proposal.  At times, he made controversial statements, and in 1912 he was successfully sued for libel by the Liberal Joseph Henry."]}, {"page": "Buckle, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Buckle"]}]}}
