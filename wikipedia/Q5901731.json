He briefly challenged Hedley Verity for Wilfred Rhodes's vacated berth, but was soon overshadowed, and played only when Verity was on Test duties. He was a fine performer in his own right however, taking 93 wickets at 28.18. He was a useful batsman in the lower order, scoring 681 runs at an average of 15.47. He was awarded his Yorkshire cap in 1935.He is notable as the first bowler to ever claim a hat trick of LBW victims, in the course of taking 5 for 12 against Somerset at Sheffield in August 1932. Umpire Alex Skelding, after dispatching Mandy Mitchell-Innes for five and then Bill Andrews first ball in the same manner, stared up the wicket at the new man Wally Luckes, when the third appeal was made. After a pregnant pause, he stated, \"As God's my witness, that's out, too\". In the same match, Fisher posted his highest ever first-class score in Yorkshire's only innings, an unbeaten 76, as Yorkshire ran out winners by an innings and 93. Earlier that week Fisher took six wickets for 11 runs, against Leicestershire at Bradford, which remained his best bowling return.Fisher died in April 1974, in Middlestown, Horbury, Yorkshire, at the age of 70.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill Bowes", "response": ["Yorkshire at this time was in a period of transition. They had won the championship four times between 1922 and 1925 but had since then been overshadowed by their great rivals Lancashire who had won the title in each of the preceding three seasons. In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established professionals like Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year. Waiting in the wings, however, was Hedley Verity who was then playing in the Lancashire League and made his Yorkshire debut in 1930."]}, {"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Horace Fisher (1903\u20131974), English cricketer", "*Horace Fisher (painter) (1861\u20131928), British painter"]}, {"page": "Alec Skelding", "response": ["Despite this, he famously officiated over the first all LBW hat trick in cricket, taken by Horace Fisher, the Yorkshire slow left-armer against Somerset County Cricket Club at Bramall Lane in 1932.
