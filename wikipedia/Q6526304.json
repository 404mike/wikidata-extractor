Pandana; Varro, de Ling. Lat. v. 42, as cited by Schmitz Her temple was an asylum which was always open. Needy supplicants who came to it were supplied with food from the resources of the temple. In the opinion of Leonhard Schmitz, this custom shows the meaning of the name Panda or Empanda: it is connected with pandere, to open; she is accordingly the goddess who is open to or admits any one who wants protection. Hartung(die Religion der R\u00f6m. ii. p. 76, &c.) \u2013 cited by Schmitz thinks that Empanda and Panda are only surnames of Juno."]}, {"page": "Vacuna", "response": ["The protection she was asked to provide remains obscure.
