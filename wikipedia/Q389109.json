This was an enormous social change, doing much to increase Conservative support amongst new homeowners and which Heseltine often cites as one of his major achievements.Crick 1997, pp. 200\u20131. Heseltine noted that, \"no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people.\" He said that the 'right to buy' policy had two main objectives: to give people what they had wanted, and to reverse the trend of ever-increasing dominance of the State over the life of the individual. He said: \"There is in this country a deeply ingrained desire for home ownership. The Government believe that this spirit should be fostered. It reflects the wishes of the people, ensures the wide spread of wealth through society, encourages a personal desire to improve and modernize one's own home, enables parents to accrue wealth for their children and stimulates the attitudes of independence and self-reliance that are the bedrock of a free society.\"\"Housing Bill \u2013 Provisions and Enactment\" in Keesing's Contemporary Archives v. 27, January 1981 p. 30644. Many of the homes sold were \"street properties\" rather than flats, which arguably helped to ghettoise the remaining council tenants on run-down inner city estates. In fact, in Crick's view, he deserves only limited credit \u2013 it had been a Conservative commitment since 1974, and much of the detailed work was done by his juniors Hugh Rossi (in opposition) and John Stanley (in government).", "Before Heseltine's arrival at the Ministry of Defence. Tam Dalyell had exposed inconsistencies in ministerial accounts of the sinking of the Argentinian warship ARA General Belgrano during the Falklands War of 1982, and alleged that she had been sunk to sabotage Foreign Office attempts to negotiate peace via Washington and Peru. Heseltine, apparently worried that there might be a scandal comparable to Watergate, asked Clive Ponting, a civil servant who had played an important role in Derek Rayner's efficiency reforms, to draw up a detailed report into the sinking of the Belgrano. At the end of March 1984 Ponting attended a series of meetings with Heseltine. He and the Permanent Under-Secretary Clive Whitmore wanted to disclose further information to reveal that the Belgrano had been spotted a day earlier than had previously been admitted. John Stanley, thought to be Thatcher's eyes and ears in the Ministry of Defence, initially opposed it, but Thatcher was persuaded that a letter should be sent the Opposition Defence Spokesman Denzil Davies. However, both Heseltine and Thatcher rejected Ponting's draft which would have admitted for the first time that the Belgrano had been sighted a day earlier and stated that she was sailing away from the British taskforce when sunk.it was finally revealed in 2011 that the Belgrano had in fact been sailing back towards the taskforce when sunk, but this intelligence was kept secret at the time \u2013 see the article on the Belgrano for details. Ponting later stated that Stanley had asked Thatcher to overrule Heseltine on the matter; he withheld information not just from Dalyell but from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which was conducting its own inquiry, citing national security considerations.", "Six days after Heseltine's letter to Denzil Davies, Ponting sent Davies an anonymous note stating that the letter had been written according to the advice of John Stanley, but contrary to the advice of civil servants, and suggesting other potential lines of inquiry. Three months later he sent two documents exposing the alleged cover up. Heseltine strongly supported, and by some accounts pushed for, the prosecution of Ponting (Ministry of Defence police had advised against, but the Solicitor-General Sir Patrick Mayhew urged that he should be). Heseltine later said that Thatcher had not been involved in the decision to prosecute. Neither Heseltine nor Stanley were called as witnesses at Ponting's trial in January 1985 (Richard Mottram, Heseltine's Private Secretary, gave evidence on behalf of the Ministry of Defence). To general surprise Ponting was acquitted. A week later Heseltine launched a stinging seventy-minute attack on Ponting in the House of Commons, and a year later he walked out of a Channel 4 News studio on being told that a recorded interview with Ponting was also to be shown. Stanley was seen as the villain of the piece, whereas Heseltine had merely declined to correct false statements made by others.Crick 1997, pp. 260\u20132."]}, {"page": "John Stanley", "response": ["John Stanley may refer to:", "*John Stanley (composer) (1712\u20131786), English composer and organist", "*John Stanley (cartoonist) (1914\u20131993), comic book writer and artist best known for Little Lulu", "*John Stanley (playwright) (born 1966), British playwright and screenwriter", "*John Stanley (radio broadcaster), Australian radio presenter", "*Sir John Stanley (1350\u20131414), Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and King of Mann", "*Sir John Stanley (1386\u20131437), Knight of the Garter and King of Mann, MP for Lancashire", "*Sir John Stanley, 1st Baronet (1663\u20131744), Chief Secretary for Ireland and Member of Parliament (MP) for Gorey", "*John Stanley (Hastings MP) (1740\u20131799), British MP for Hastings", "*John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley (1766\u20131850), British peer and politician", "*Sir John Stanley (1846\u20131931), Chief Justice of North Western Provinces, British India", "*John Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby (1918\u20131994), British peer, landowner and businessman", "*Sir John Stanley (Tonbridge and Malling MP) (born 1942), British politician"]}, {"page": "John Paul Stanley", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Stanley (Tonbridge and Malling MP)"]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Sir John Stanley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir John Stanley"]}, {"page": "Tonbridge and Malling", "response": ["*Rt Hon Sir John Stanley MP: 7 May 1994"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*John Stanley (b. 1942)"]}, {"page": "List of ministers under Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["!scope=row|John Stanley", "!scope=row|John Stanley", "!scope=row|John Stanley"]}, {"page": "Tonbridge and Malling (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir John Stanley"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: S", "response": ["*John Stanley"]}, {"page": "Committees on Arms Export Controls", "response": ["In 2015 to 2016 the committee did not meet for over 9 months after the chairman Sir John Stanley retired as an MP, because of a long delay in appointing new members.

He stated that the arrests themselves were lawful, but the subsequent detention period that followed whilst being interviewed, was not in line with the standards and parameters laid down for arrested persons.
