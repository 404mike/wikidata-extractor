An amateur, he captained Yorkshire from 1948 to 1955 and England on fourteen occasions between 1947 and 1950, winning four Tests, losing seven and drawing three.  Yardley was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1948 and in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was described as Yorkshire's finest amateur since Stanley Jackson.\nYardley played schoolboy cricket at St Peter's, York. A highly talented all-round sportsman, he went to St John's College, Cambridge, and won Blues at cricket, squash, rugby fives and field hockey. In the university matches, he scored 90 in his second year, 101 in his third and was captain for his final year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 1936 and played for the county  until 1955, when he retired as a player. He made his Test match debut against South Africa in 1939 and after the Second World War was chosen as vice-captain to Wally Hammond on the 1946\u201447 tour of Australia where he captained England in the fifth Test. He followed Hammond as skipper in 1947, and captained England intermittently until 1950 when his business commitments allowed. In 1948 he succeeded to the Yorkshire leadership when Brian Sellers resigned. Yardley remained in the position until 1955, during a time when Yorkshire had several difficult players in their dressing room. Under Yardley, Yorkshire were joint champions in 1949 but subsequently on a number of occasions, too often for the liking of supporters, finished second to Surrey in the County Championship. He served as a Test match selector between 1951 and 1954, acting as chairman of selectors in 1952. He was President of Yorkshire C.C.C. from 1981 to 1983, when he resigned after becoming involved in controversy over the decision to release Geoffrey Boycott in 1983. He died after a stroke in 1989.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["While Laker had done enough at Saltaire to be well remembered there, his cricketing career really gathered pace and took off while he was with the RAOC in Egypt. Playing on coconut matting wickets in inter-service matches, he decided to develop the off spin technique he had been taught by Benny Wilson. He recalled that, \"to my utter amazement\", he could turn the ball \"quite prodigiously\" on the matting strips. John Arlott later wrote that English cricketers in Egypt were writing home and talking about \"a Yorkshire lad who could bowl off spin like a master\". In 1943, Laker went to Alexandria to play for the RAOC against an RAF team and took five wickets for ten runs including a hat-trick. In 1944, he played against a South African Air Force XI, scored a century and then took six wickets for ten runs. In these matches, he encountered several top-class players including Norman Yardley, Peter Smith, Bert Sutcliffe, Ron Aspinall, Dudley Nourse and Arthur McIntyre."]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Norman Yardley \u2013 BBC Radio 1956\u20131969"]}, {"page": "1947 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Alan Melville, Norman Yardley, Martin Donnelly, Dudley Nourse, Jack Robertson"]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["As with most of their young players, Yorkshire intended to take their time over establishing Trueman and were prepared to set him aside for lengthy periods. The established pace bowlers in 1949 were Alec Coxon and Ron Aspinall, both fast-medium, while captain Norman Yardley was a \"capable third seam bowler\".Arlott, pp. 21\u201322. History was against Trueman as the county rarely looked for fast bowlers with express speed, instead preferring \"the medium or fast-medium bowler with his capacity for control, economy and long spells\". Trueman, once he became established, was a clear breach of Yorkshire tradition.Arlott, p. 21.", "The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25.", "Despite their internal problems and disharmony, Yorkshire finished second behind Warwickshire in the County Championship.Webber, pp. 83\u201385. One of the problem players, Alex Coxon, surprisingly resigned after the 1950 season and it was widely said that \"his face did not fit\", even though he was a top-class bowler who had played for England.As It Was, p. 77. Brian Close made only two appearances as he completed his national service; and Ray Illingworth made his debut but played in only the one match. With Johnny Whitehead playing only seven times, Yorkshire relied mainly on a squad of 13 players including Trueman, who played in 26 championship matches. The other twelve regulars were Yardley (captain), Hutton, Lowson, Lester, Watson, Wilson, Halliday, Sutcliffe, Brennan, Wardle, Leadbeater and Appleyard. On Monday, 13 August 1951, Trueman and Bob Appleyard were awarded their county caps by team captain Norman Yardley.As It Was, p. 94."]}, {"page": "Len Hutton", "response": ["Following his struggles at Lord's, Hutton was omitted from the team for the third Test. Observers had noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers, which the English selectors saw as a poor example from a leading batsman.Gibson, p. 189.Bowes, p. 190. The decision generated considerable acrimony, but surprised and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat.Fingleton, p. 120. Press and critics generally judged the omission a mistake, although the Wisden correspondent believed the decision to be correct as Hutton benefited from a break. In later years, Norman Yardley, the England captain, agreed that the choice was a poor one. Hutton, who escaped most of the debate by playing in Scotland for Yorkshire,Howat, pp. 77\u201378. found the situation unsettling and Patrick Murphy, a sports journalist, writes that it \"served to drive a reserved man further in on himself.\" Meanwhile, Hutton was chosen to captain the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's; he scored 59 and 132 not out.", "As captain, Hutton believed that the key to success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his selection of several promising fast bowlers. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down the game to allow the fast bowlers to rest, which set a precedent for other captains.Gibson, p. 190. Tactically, Norman Yardley found him \"sound rather than venturesome\".Howat, p. 198. Run saving was his main priority, but during matches, he quickly adjusted his approach to attack the weakness of particular batsmen. Jim Kilburn believed that Hutton pursued a serious approach to all matches, to the point where he missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the \"outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; he lit no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience.\"", "Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, except in the absence of the official captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play.Chalke and Hodgson, p. 171. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the Yorkshire dressing room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking.Howat, p. 88. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. Ray Illingworth, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but \"he didn't do anything about it\".Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 166\u201367. Illingworth recalled that he was a \"distant hero\", saying: \"He was a funny man was Len\u2014slightly sarcastic all the time. He'd hear an argument in the dressing room and he'd throw a bit of wood on the fire to keep it going. He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner.\""]}, {"page": "Yardley", "response": ["*Norman Yardley (1915\u20131989), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Norman Yardley"]}, {"page": "John Arlott", "response": ["Prior to 1957, BBC radio covered every home Test match, with Arlott normally one of the commentators, but it did not broadcast uninterrupted ball-by-ball commentary.

In the second innings, Miller's first ball was a hat-trick ball from English captain Norman Yardley; he survived a loud leg before wicket appeal and then hit a six into the grandstand, on his way to 74.Fingleton, pp. 120\u2013121. Australia declared at 7/460, 595\u00a0runs ahead.Perry, p. 241. Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409\u00a0runs.Perry, pp. 240\u2013241.Fingleton, p. 112.", "The teams moved to Headingley for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Hutton had been recalled and the home team batted first. England tallied 496 and Miller took 1/43.Fingleton, pp. 145\u2013151. In reply, Australia were struggling at 3/68 in reply on the third morning. Neil Harvey, playing his first Ashes Test, joined Miller at the crease.Perry, p. 245. The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted Jim Laker's first ball over square leg for six. Miller struck consecutive sixes over long off and the sightscreen respectively. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative; Harvey joined in and hit consecutive boundaries against Laker. Miller then lifted another six over long off, and another over long on from Norman Yardley. He was dismissed for 58 attempting another six.Perry, p. 246.Fingleton, p. 162.Fingleton, p. 163. The partnership had yielded 121\u00a0runs in only 90\u00a0minutes, and was described by Wisden as a \"hurricane\". John Arlott described the innings as the most memorable that he had witnessed. He said \"Miller played like an emperor ... Every stroke would have been memorable but each one had bettered its predecessor\".Perry, p. 247. Jack Fingleton said that he had never \"known a more enjoyable hour\" of \"delectable cricket\".Fingleton, pp. 162\u2013163. The momentum swung and Australia finished at 457 on the fourth day, having added almost 396 in one day's play. Miller took 1/53 in the second innings as Australia were set a world record chase of 404 on the final day. He made only 12 but Australia broke the world record to take a 3\u20130 lead.Fingleton, pp. 170\u2013178."]}, {"page": "Hedley Verity", "response": ["Since around 1937, Verity had expected the outbreak of the Second World War and had prepared for it through reading military literature.Hill, pp. 133\u201334. He and Bowes decided to enlist together, and after briefly serving in the Air Raid Precautions in Guiseley until Bowes' wife gave birth, they attempted to join the infantry.Bowes, pp. 132\u201333.Hill, p. 134. However, Bowes was hampered by an old knee complaint and later became a gunnery officer. After serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, Verity was commissioned in January 1940 as a second lieutenant in the Green Howards, and later promoted to captain. Following a spell at the Infantry Training Centre, he was posted to the 1st\u00a0Battalion. He served at the regimental depot in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he was responsible for training recruits.Hill, pp. 134\u201335. In the spring of 1941, the battalion moved to Omagh in Northern Ireland for further training.Hill, p. 137. Verity's Yorkshire and England teammate Norman Yardley was also in the 1st Battalion; the fame of these cricketers made an impression on the local population. Playing several cricket matches, Verity frequently took wickets on rough pitches that were unsuitable for batting. There was even time for his appearance in a charity match at Lord's.Hill, pp. 136\u201340.
