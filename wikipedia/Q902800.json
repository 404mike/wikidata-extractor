Having taken the helmet from Shaw, Magneto is rendered immune to any form of telepathy and mind control as seen in the first two film entries. His powers are much more limited when compared to his depiction in comics. Whereas he's displayed controlling magnetism to an almost unlimited degree in the comics, he is generally restricted to manipulating metal within the films.
