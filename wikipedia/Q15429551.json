His work became increasingly experimental. It was published in widely available volumes by Fulcrum and Trigram, and in limited editions by Ted Kavanagh, Turret Books, and others. His sequence Brother Wolf in 1972 focused on the life of Thomas Chatterton, who would remain an important influence. In the same year he began working at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich as a conservator of paintings. He was particularly enthusiastic about the work of John Everett, whom he commemorated in poems collected in Odes. However, an interview with Eric Mottram recalls that working conditions were poor and MacSweeney worried about his eyesight, so that he returned to journalism in 1973. Luke Roberts has argued that MacSweeney's sequence Toad Church was much influenced by the Maritime Museum setting and by the work of French poets like Jules Laforgue and Arthur Rimbaud."]}, {"page": "Max Gate", "response": ["* Max Gate, painting by John Everett"]}, {"page": "Ernest Stephen Lumsden", "response": ["In 1925 the publishers Seeley Service issued what is still regarded as the seminal treatise on the subject of etching, called The Art of Etching.

Her father was Henry Herbert of the Muckross estate. Everett had a difficult and unhappy relationship with her mother, leading her to leave home as a teenager living with relatives or others as a companion. She attended the Slade Art School, where she got to know her first cousin, John Everett. They married in 1901 and had two sons, Henry, born 1902 and Anthony, born 1906. Her husband would leave for long periods at a time, eventually leaving Everett in 1914 with two young sons and no income. She worked for a time as a nurse, in various hospitals including Mercer's Hospital, Dublin. Later she became a gardener and companion to the Baring banking family. From 1915 she and her sons lived in a Georgian house, Sybil Hill, which belonged to the widowed Lady Ardilaun. She was Everett's distant cousin and godmother. After Lady Ardilaun's death in 1925, Everett left Ireland and never returned. She lived for a time in British Columbia, and Italy, before settling in England."]}]}}
