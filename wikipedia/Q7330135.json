There he was involved with the integration of Stereo Operations from just test transmissions into the regular output of Radio 3 in the late 1960s. As stereo proliferated across BBC Radio he transferred to the Music Department as a Studio Manager. There his technical expertise was in demand for the presentation of electronic music concerts working with contemporary composers such as Stockhausen, Berio, Boulez etc. This experience led him to join the BBC Radiophonic Workshop where he produced the special sound for the science fiction series Blake's 7, amongst other programmes. Later he became the Technical Coordinator for the Workshop when electronic synthesizers started taking over from Musique Concrete.Richard left the BBC in 1978 to become the Chief Technical Engineer at Roundhouse Recording Studios and oversaw the installation and operation of one of the first 3M Digital Multitrack Mastering System in the UK. Leaving Roundhouse Studios in the early 1980s, he joined F.W.O. Bauch as a field service engineer, and later became Service Manager for their professional broadcast products.\nIn 2002, Richard was recruited to the BFI National Archive. Working with Charles Fairall, his vast knowledge and experience of sound and digital techniques transformed the audio department's capabilities to cater for sound restoration of the optical soundtracks of films being restored by the BFI for both theatrical and DVD release. He led the sound restoration project for a special David Lean Centenary collection of ten of the best known Lean films, which were re-released digitally in 2008.\nSince his retirement from the BFI in 2012, Richard was the technical powerhouse behind the Church Stretton Arts Festival, quietly providing a dazzling array of skills, knowledge and equipment each year to the benefit of numerous artists and audiences.\nRichard died after a short illness on 16 September 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC Radiophonic Workshop", "response": ["The original Radiophonic Workshop was based in the BBC's Maida Vale Studios in Delaware Road, Maida Vale, London.

Its members included Daphne Oram, Delia Derbyshire, David Cain, John Baker, Paddy Kingsland, Glynis Jones, Maddalena Fagandini and Richard Yeoman-Clark.", "By this point the output of the Workshop was vast with high demand for complete scores for programmes as well as the themes and sound effects for which it had made its name. By the end of the decade the workshop was contributing to over 300 programmes a year from all departments of the BBC and had long since expanded from its early two-room setup. Its contributions included material for programmes such as The Body in Question, Blue Peter and Tomorrow's World as well as sound effects for popular science fiction programmes Blake's 7 and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (in both its radio and television forms) by Richard Yeoman-Clark and Paddy Kingsland respectively.", "*Richard Yeoman-Clark (1970\u20131978)", "**Blake's 7 (effects by Richard Yeoman-Clark & Elizabeth Parker)"]}, {"page": "Blake's 7", "response": ["Blake's 7s theme music was written by Australian composer Dudley Simpson, who had composed music for Doctor Who for more than ten years.

Elizabeth Parker provided the music and sound effects for \"Gambit\". Blake's 7 made considerable use of audio effects that are described in the credits as \"special sound\".
