Bailey founded the Gogmagogs theatre-music group (1995\u20132006) and was Artistic Director and joint founder of the Print Room theatre in West London (2010-2012). She has worked extensively with Bunny Christie and other leading stage designers, including her husband William Dudley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Titus Andronicus", "response": ["right|thumb|Laura Rees as Lavinia in Lucy Bailey's 2006 production at Shakespeare's Globe; note the 'realistic' effects and blood", "In 2006, two major productions were staged within a few weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed for the first time in its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium \u2013 a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.", "Several reviews of the time made much of the manner in which each production approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape; \"At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry.\"  Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, said of the scene, \"audience members turned their heads away in real distress.\"Eleanor Collins, \"Titus Andronicus, directed by Lucy Bailey, The Globe, London, 31 May & 11 July 2006\", Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, 70:2 (Autumn, 2006), 49\u201351 Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia \"almost too ghastly to behold.\" Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage \"chills the blood.\" Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole; \"violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war.\" Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked \"is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?\"  Similarly, The Guardians Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote \"At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence.\" Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, for example, wrote \"Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic.\"Neil Allan and Scott Revers, \"Titus Andronicus, directed by Yukio Ninagawa for The Ninagawa Company, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, 21 June 2006\", Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, Special Issue: The Royal Shakespeare Company Complete Works (2007), 39\u201341 Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote \"Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror.\"Paul Taylor, \"Review of Yukio Ninagawa's Titus Andronicus\", The Independent (22 June 2006) Ninagawa himself said \"\"The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production.\" In her 2013 essay, \"Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agn\u00e8s Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a \"visual emblem\"; \"Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance ... Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to \"dissonance,\" the production presents Lavinia onstage as if she were a painting ... Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood ... are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it.\"Agn\u00e8s Lafont, \"Mythological reconfigurations on the contemporary stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\", Early Modern Literary Studies, Special Issue 21 (2013)"]}, {"page": "Great Expectations", "response": ["* 2016 \u2013 West Yorkshire Playhouse adaptation written by Michael Eaton and directed by Lucy Bailey.
