Contemporaries and modern historians comment on T\u00e1hirih's rare physical beauty. A courtier described her as \"moonfaced\",A typical Persian expression meaning exceedingly beautiful \"with hair like musk\" whilst one of her fathers pupils wondered how a woman of her beauty could be so intelligent. Historian Nab\u00edl-i-A\u02bbzam reports the \"highest terms of [her] beauty\", George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, wrote, \"beauty and the female sex also lent their consecration to the new creed and the heroism\u2026 the lovely but ill-fated poetess of Qazv\u00edn\".George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston's Persia and the Persian Question, vol. 1, p. 497, note 2 British Professor Edward Granville Browne who spoke to a great number of her contemporaries, wrote that she was renowned for her \"marvellous beauty\". The Shah's Austrian physician, Jakob Eduard Polak, also cited her beauty. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Bah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num noted her beauty in several talks and writings. T\u00e1hirih's education with her father lead her to become a devoutly religious and she upheld these beliefs for the rest of her life. It also made her hungry for knowledge and she busied herself with reading and writing religious and other forms of literature. Her formal education ended when she was about thirteen or fourteen, when she was summoned by her father to consent to a betrothal arranged by her uncle and father.", "After her conversion to the B\u00e1b\u00ed faith, the poems of T\u00e1hirih flourished. In most she talks about her longing to meet the B\u00e1b. Her poetry illustrates an impressive knowledge of Persian and Arabic literature which T\u00e1hirih possessed, seldom seen in a woman in mid-nineteenth century Iran. One of the most famous poems attributed to her is named Point by Point. Although it is widely considered her signature poem and a masterpiece, it has been claimed by Mohit Tab\u00e1tab\u00e1'i to be older and by someone else \u2013 though in making this claim he offered no proof and any argument to the contrary is not possible in Iran. When T\u00e1hirih was killed, hostile family members suppressed or destroyed her remaining poems, whilst her others were spread across Iran. It has been suggested that T\u00e1hirih had little interest in putting her poems in print. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 recalls that when he was aged five T\u00e1hirih would chant her poetry to him in her beautiful voice.
