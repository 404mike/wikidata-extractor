Miniskirts became progressively shorter between the early and mid-1960s. As female mod fashion became more mainstream, slender models like Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy began to exemplify the mod look. Maverick fashion designers emerged, such as Mary Quant, who was known for her miniskirt designs, and John Stephen, who sold a line named \"His Clothes\" and whose clients included bands such as Small Faces. The television programme Ready Steady Go! helped spread awareness of mod fashions to a larger audience. Mod-culture continues to influence fashion, with the ongoing trend for mod-inspired styles such as 3-button suits, Chelsea boots and mini dresses. The Mod Revival of the 1980s and 1990s led to a new era of mod-inspired fashion, driven by bands such as Madness, The Specials and Oasis. The popularity of the This Is England film and TV series also kept mod fashion in the public eye. Today's mod icons include Miles Kane (frontman of the Last Shadow Puppets), cyclist Bradley Wiggins and Paul Weller, 'The ModFather'."]}, {"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* John Stephen"]}, {"page": "List of people from Glasgow", "response": ["*John Stephen \u2013 fashion designer; King of Carnaby St"]}, {"page": "1958 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* First boutique, His Clothes, to be opened in Carnaby Street, London, by John Stephen."]}, {"page": "1934 in Scotland", "response": ["* 28 August \u2013 John Stephen, menswear entrepreneur (died 2004 in England)"]}, {"page": "Lord John", "response": ["The first Lord John boutique was opened by the brothers Warren, Harold and David Gold in Carnaby Street in 1963, and the choice of name led to litigation from John Stephen who already owned several fashion shops in the street."]}, {"page": "Warren Gold", "response": ["The first Lord John boutique was opened by Warren, Harold and David Gold in London's Carnaby Street in 1963, and the choice of name led to litigation from John Stephen who already owned several fashion shops in the street."]}, {"page": "Angus McGill", "response": ["What McGill enjoyed was meeting people who were not then famous, but enterprising: wavemakers such as pioneering restaurateur Robert Carrier, Carnaby Street retailer John Stephen, inventors of the rock musical Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the legendary \"living lord\" Maharaj Ji,\"Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji?\".
