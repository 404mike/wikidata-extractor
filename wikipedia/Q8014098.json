This gives them a highest note around a major third below that of men's voice glees. Some care is required in interpreting the intended voicing of Glees in contemporary editions, due to the gradual replacement, taking place at this time, of the C Clef with the Treble Clef but often without the required octave transposition being specified.

At that point, the King's Scholars of Westminster School shouted the traditional acclamation, \"Vivat Georgius Rex!\".
