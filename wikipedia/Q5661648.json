She was able to find work in Stoke-on-Trent but the traditional potters there failed to take advantage of knowledge of modern design and manufacture. It was Mintons who decided after six months that her work was commercial. She continued to rent her own studios where she bought other peoples designs which she decorated. She later married the English educator Harold Marks, in London and in Staffordshire she painted and continued to experiment with pottery made from broken shards."]}]}}
