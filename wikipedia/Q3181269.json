Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects.Bourdon, p. 87. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show.

In this painting, Yin turns a natural and much-used part of the human body to communicate something that seems foreign and lack-luster.

Beginning as early as Francisco Goya's Maja paintings and reaching an apogee with Claude Monet's Rouen Cathedral series, the repetition and variation of some selected subject matter has served the history of art in many different capacities since the beginning of the nineteenth century.  It was not until the 1960s and Pop art, however, that this strategy was intentionally deployed to echo the products of media and consumer culture.  Andy Warhol's 32 Campbell Soup Cans, first exhibited at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962, are exemplary in this instance.
