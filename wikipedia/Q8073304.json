The character was played by Keeley Hawes. Prior to starting her job, Zoe studies for her degree at Oxford University; this is revealed to Danny Hunter when she is preparing to go undercover in the third episode of series two. One of her main talents is in linguistics, and she is shown translating Serbian dialogue in the first episode of series two.\nZoe is a junior case officer in Section D, which she joined shortly before September 1997, and is part of the original leading trio (along with Tom Quinn and Danny Hunter). At the end of the second episode of the show, she moves in with Danny and the two young spooks form a very strong bond. She also forms strong relationships with Harry Pearce (her boss and someone whom she respected a lot), and Ruth Evershed. Zoe is brilliant at her job and has excellent instincts and charm, which make her particularly suited to undercover work. One of her undercover roles leads to her dismissal from the service.\nThroughout her career as a spook her confidence and morale take a big beating. She is distraught to find out that Tessa Phillips is corrupt, as she has admired Tessa greatly. This is made even worse by the fact that Zoe is very much involved in her downfall. She goes through a similar hard time when Tom is alleged to be a rogue officer. Her confidence takes a bigger beating when she and the rest of the team manage to clear his name, only for him to be decommissioned in the next episode.\nIn series 3, Zoe gets engaged to a photographer named Will, which leads to tensions between her and Danny. In episode 6 of this series, Zoe is seen in court, charged with conspiracy to murder. When she is found guilty, Zoe is sentenced to 10 years in prison and is forced to abscond to Chile, without Will, to avoid being jailed. This leads to a very emotional goodbye between her and Danny. Later on, Danny, seeing how Will is suffering, reveals Zoe's fate, and Will leaves to rejoin her in Chile. The two later send Danny a postcard, with a picture hidden inside it of them together.\nIn the book Spooks: The Personnel Files, Zoe, accepting the fact she will never see Danny again, sets up a PO box for him to write back, and finally expresses her feelings for him. In the meantime, Zoe continues her life with Will, and at the time of writing the message, is pregnant with the child Zoe has always wanted. Zoe uses a tourist she befriended abroad to sneak the message back to Britain hidden inside a utility bill.\nSadly, the postcard arrives ten days after Danny was shot dead, so he never knows the depth of Zoe's affections. The postcard is instead re-routed to Danny's mother, and is subsequently intercepted by Special Branch and referred to MI5.\nThe postcard, with certain details redacted, is added to Zoe's closed file, as her identity and whereabouts must still be protected.  Harry notes the fact that Danny never knew the depth of Zoe's affections as a sad reminder of the price MI5 officers are required to suffer. The book Spooks: Harry's Diary confirms its existence, and both sources are considered canon to the storyline.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spooks (TV series)", "response": ["*Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes; 2002\u20132004) Junior Case Officer, Section D.

Matthew Macfadyen plays primary protagonist and senior case officer Tom Quinn. Creator David Wolstencroft found Tom to be the most fun, yet hardest character to write for due to him being the main character. When portraying the character, Macfadyen did what he was told to do; he did not want to create a backstory for the character as he did not find merit in doing so. Keeley Hawes plays junior case officer Zoe Reynolds. Hawes was attracted to the parallels between acting and spying. The actress described Zoe as \"a feisty little number. She can be quite cold and you don't really know her,\" and the series sees \"flashes of how she can be\". David Oyelowo plays fellow junior case officer Danny Hunter. Oyelowo first became aware of the show when his agent brought him the script, and was quickly intrigued by the project, and wanted a part to play in it. He downplayed his enthusiasm to get the part. Macfadyen, Hawes and Oyelowo were initially wary of playing the lead characters even though the actors were in their mid-twenties, but eventually felt that they earned the right to be in the series."]}, {"page": "Spooks (series 2)", "response": ["* Keeley Hawes as Zoe Reynolds"]}, {"page": "Spooks (series 3)", "response": ["The third series of the British spy drama television series Spooks (known as MI-5 in the United States) began broadcasting on 11 October 2004 on BBC One, and ended on 13 December 2004.

Keeley Hawes also returns in the series as Zoe Reynolds. Hawes wanted to leave the series also after the first six episodes. David Oyelowo makes a return as Danny Hunter. After Tom's exit, it allowed Danny's character to develop further. Oyelowo also announced his intention to leave the series, after the finale episode. Peter Firth returns as superior Harry Pearce.

Nicola Walker returns as Ruth Evershed. First appearing in the second series, Walker felt more like the \"new girl,\" but felt more experienced upon her return to the third.
