A former professional with Port Vale and Rochdale throughout the 1990s, he spent time with numerous non-league clubs, before moving into management with Alsager Town and later Rochdale Town. He helped Port Vale to promotion out of the Second Division in 1993\u201394 and played in the final of the 1996 Anglo-Italian Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dean Anthony Stokes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dean Stokes"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season  started poorly, with the Vale picking up just one win in the opening eight games. On 5 September, Trevor Wood conceded a penalty at Vetch Field in an 'off the ball' incident with a Swansea player and was subsequently dropped in favour of Musselwhite, who remained an ever present in the Vale side for the rest of the season. From 12 September to 13 February they went on a club-record streak of 22 games without failing to score \u2013 losing just two games in the process (one of these being a 2\u20131 defeat to Stoke City at the Victoria Ground). Overlapping this spell, from 1 January to 14 March they went on a club-record six straight home defeats. This in turn was followed by two further club-records, as between 20 March and 24 April they made five consecutive away wins, picking up clean sheets in all five games. In January, Dean Stokes was signed from non-league Halesowen Town for \u00a35,000. The next month Peter Billing arrived on loan from Coventry City, and impressed enough to earn a permanent move three months later, at a fee of \u00a335,000. Alex Mathie also arrived on loan from Greenock Morton, but failed to make an impact. They won four of their final five games, but this was not enough to gain them a promotion place, as Bolton won fifteen of their final eighteen games."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Anglo-Italian Cup", "response": ["|DF || ||  Dean Stokes|| || "]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dean Stokes", "| January 1993 || DF ||  || Dean Stokes || Halesowen Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dean Stokes"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dean Stokes"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dean Stokes"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the season, Lee Mills was signed by Premier League Bradford City, becoming Bradford's first million pound player.
