Their pages on Bebo were later shut down. Brendan Gallagher of The Daily Telegraph later commented that the photos were \"comparatively tame\" and \"not the cleverest move for a wannabe tennis star but hardly scandalous behaviour for a 17-year-old.\" The actions of the LTA led to Broady refusing to play for the national team, a position she has maintained throughout her career.
