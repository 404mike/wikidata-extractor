Educated at Gresham's School, Holt, and Cambridge University, he trained as an architect at the Architectural Association.\nHe worked at J.

James Maude Richards, hired by Williams, served as an architectural assistant within the all-engineer staff. Percy Morley Horder, consulting architect to Gordon's Hotels, had not been consulted during the design process and, after seeing the plan, resigned from the project, remarking to The Observer that the design was ill-suited for the location, assuming the concrete was to be left unpainted and that the insulation would be minimal. Some 40,000 tonnes of earth were excavated to make room for the hotel's extensive basement which is one-third of the size of the hotel above the surface. The upper eight floors were erected in just 10 weeks, supported on a massive  thick reinforced concrete deck that forms the roof of the first floor. With the development of the Dorchester, concerns were raised that Park Lane would soon become New York City's Fifth Avenue."]}, {"page": "Architectural Review", "response": ["The Architectural Review was founded as a monthly magazine, the Architectural Review for the Artist and Craftsman, in 1896 by Percy Hastings, owner of the Architectural Press, with an editorial board of Reginald Blomfield, Mervyn Macartney and Ernest Newton. In 1927 his third son, Hubert de Cronin Hastings, became joint editor (with Christian Berman) of both The Architectural Review and the Architects' Journal, a weekly. Together they made substantial changes to the aims and style of the review, which became a general arts magazine with an architectural emphasis. Contributors from other artistic fields were brought in, among them Hilaire Belloc, Robert Byron, Cyril Connolly, D.H. Lawrence, Paul Nash, Nikolaus Pevsner, P. Morton Shand, Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell, and Evelyn Waugh. John Betjeman was an assistant editor from 1930 to 1934. The editorial board included Pevsner, Hugh Casson, Osbert Lancaster and James Maude Richards. The design of the review was innovative, with bold use of layout, typefaces and photographs; graphic elements were commissioned from Eric Gill and Edward Bawden. The articles on European Modernist architecture by P. Morton Shand published from July 1934 were among the earliest in Britain on the subject. By about 1935 the magazine had acquired a leading position in the discourse surrounding Modernism.", "*James Maude Richards \u2013 co-editor or editor, 1935 to 1971, excluding the war years"]}, {"page": "List of Old Greshamians", "response": ["*Sir James Maude Richards \u2013 architectural historian"]}, {"page": "James Richards", "response": ["* James Maude Richards (1907\u20131992), British architectural writer"]}, {"page": "Peggy Angus", "response": ["After her visit to Russia in 1932, she became one of the founding members of Artists' International Association, an organisation born out of social and political conflicts of the 1930s.
