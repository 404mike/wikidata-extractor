While typically practiced on sea cliffs at high tide, it can also be done on climbs above reservoirs, rivers, and even swimming pools.II Open Internacional de Psicobloc Ciutat de Barcelona Bi Zaes (in Spanish)  Often a dinghy or other small boat is kept on scene to pick up the fallen climber, as a fall from a taller route can still pose the risk of being knocked unconscious on impact with the water, which could lead to drowning. Pioneers include Miquel Riera, Tim Emmett, Klem Loskot, and Chris Sharma.", "The 1990s saw an explosion in Britain for what they called \"Deep Water Soloing\" (DWS), which began with Nick Buckley's ascent of The Conger (1983). Britain's southern cost saw new routes established by the Cook brothers, Mike Robertson, Steve Taylor, and Pete Oxley.  In 1996, the British Climbers' Club, published Into the Blue: A guide to Deep Water Soloing in Dorset, which became the first-ever DWS guidebook in the world, and proposed an evolved grading system and climbing style to Britain.  In 2001, British climber [Tim Emmett]] received an email from Miquel showing Cova Del Diablo and led to a trip by Emmett that included other leading climbers such as Mike Robertson, Neil Gresham, and Austrian Klem Loskot.  Within a week they had established over twenty-six routes ranging from 4+ to 8a, bringing the total on Cova Del Diablo twenty-nine. In February 2002, Mike Robertson published an article titled 'Sympathy for the Devil' in the British magazine Climber, describing Cova Del Diablo along with details and route guides of all twenty-nine lines on the cliff."]}, {"page": "Richard Huish College, Taunton", "response": ["*Tim Emmett, adventure climber, and one of the world's leading ice climbers."]}, {"page": "Leo Houlding", "response": ["Houlding began rock climbing at the age of 10.
