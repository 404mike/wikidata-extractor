He had a string of hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s characterised by catchy pop tunes and jaunty humorous lyrics, including \"Knocked It Off\", \"To Be or Not to Be\" and \"Bang Bang\", a tongue-in-cheek commentary on famous historical and fictional couples. He wrote with Mike Rutherford of Genesis the Grammy-nominated and Ivor Novello Award-winning \"The Living Years\". It was a number one hit in the USA, Canada, Australia and Ireland and reached number 2 in his native UK. He has also written music for films and been a television presenter.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of songs that retell a work of literature", "response": ["* \"To Be or Not to Be\" by BA Robertson is based on William Shakespeare's plays."]}, {"page": "BA ROBERTSON", "response": ["#REDIRECT BA Robertson "]}, {"page": "Terry Britten", "response": ["*\"Bang Bang\" \u2013 BA Robertson", "*\"Knocked It Off\" \u2013 BA Robertson"]}, {"page": "B.A. Robertson", "response": ["#REDIRECT BA Robertson"]}, {"page": "Brian Robertson", "response": ["*BA Robertson (Brian Alexander Robertson, born 1956), Scottish musician and songwriter"]}, {"page": "The Wheel of Time (album)", "response": ["#\"Silent Running\" (Mike Rutherford, BA Robertson) \u2014 4:18"]}, {"page": "Ba robertston", "response": ["#REDIRECT BA Robertson"]}, {"page": "Abbacadabra", "response": ["The musical premiered 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for 8 weeks, closing on 21 January 1984.
