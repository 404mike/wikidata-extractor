A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [Home] recovered so much ground in so short a time was in itself an achievement.\" However, looking back across Home's career, The Times considered that his reputation rested not on his brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: \"He brought to the office\u00a0... his capacity for straight talking, for toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted as a lack of sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia.

Dutton, in his party history, took a more qualified view, suggesting that in spite of Thorpe's bold style and charisma, \"the party drifted without a sense of conviction and underlying purpose\u00a0... [and was] dominated by tactics rather than ideas\". Thorpe positioned the Liberals in the \"moderate centre\", equidistant from Labour and Conservative, a strategy which was very successful in February 1974 when dissatisfaction with the two main parties was at its height, but which left the party's specific identity obscure, and its policies largely unknown."]}, {"page": "Politics of Scotland", "response": ["* 1950: The Liberals won two seats - Jo Grimond winning Orkney and Shetland."]}, {"page": "Radical centrism", "response": ["However, most commonly cited influences and precursors are from the political realm.

The Conservatives had previously held off on contesting certain Liberal-held seats as per local-level agreements to avoid vote-splitting, but ended that policy at this election. The resultant splitting of votes actually helped grant Labour a majority, by throwing two formerly Liberal-held seats in northern England to Labour; however, the outcome of the election would not have been meaningfully altered had the Liberals retained the seats, as Labour would still have had as many seats as the other two parties combined, and Liberal leader Jo Grimond was not inclined to prop up a minority Conservative government."]}, {"page": "Unionist Party (Scotland)", "response": ["This remained the case until Labour's landslide victory at the 1945 general election.
