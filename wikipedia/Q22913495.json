The contract was given by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) to Benton & Woodiwiss with the line laid out by, and the viaduct designed by Richard Johnson (Chief Civil Engineer of the GNR); Samuel Abbott was the resident engineer. The viaduct consists of 16 lattice work deck spans, each 76 feet 7\u00a0inches long supported on wrought-iron columns with stone capped blue brick foundations. There were three additional iron skew spans at the Ilkeston end of the viaduct which carried the railway line over the Erewash Canal and the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley Line. A skew span crosses its abutments and or piers at an angle other than a right angle.", "At Awsworth Junction the railway branched, one line passed over the Bennerley Viaduct as described, the other turned North towards Pinxton crossing the Giltbrook Viaduct (or Kimberley Viaduct but known locally as Forty Bridges). This viaduct was also designed by Richard Johnson and built of red bricks used to create 43 arched spans with a total length of 1716 feet and a height of 60 feet."]}, {"page": "Handyside Bridge", "response": ["The bridge was built by Andrew Handyside and Company in 1878 when the Great Northern Railway's Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension reached Derby; it designed by Richard Johnson, the GNR's chief engineer for the extension. It consists of a single span of ,  high at the centre, supported by two bow-shaped wrought iron trusses. The unusual design avoided the need for a supporting pier in the river, keeping the Derwent clear for navigation. During construction, a test was carried out to see if it would hold the weight of the expected rail traffic.  Andrew Handyside ran six locomotives across the bridge with a combined weight of 432\u00a0tons to see if it could take the strain.Handyside Bridge Sign, Derby City Council, 2010"]}, {"page": "Friar Gate Bridge", "response": ["The bridge was built in 1878 by Andrew Handyside and Company, a Derby-based iron foundry firm, to the design of Richard Johnson, the Great Northern Railway's chief engineer for the route. It is of cast iron construction with stone abutments and is significant for the intricate decoration of the ironwork including the spandrels\u2014which contain a deer motif, similar to the one on the city's coat of arms\u2014and balustrade and the decorative two-tone paintwork. It carried the Great Northern Railway's Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension across the foot of Friar Gate and into Derby Friargate railway station from the direction of Nottingham Victoria railway station via Bennerley Viaduct. Friar Gate is a street of Georgian houses on the edge of Derby city centre and the bridge was built to be sympathetic to the local architecture, though it did not appease local residents who complained of its \"meritricious decoration, which only emphasised the insult\". The bridge is, in fact, two separate bridges set slightly apart in a vee shape; the tracks on each span served opposite sides of the island platform at Friargate station. Each bridge consists of four panels of ribbed arches bolted together."]}]}}
