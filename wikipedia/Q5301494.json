This show made broadcasting history when in 1939 it became the first full length musical to be broadcast on television.  A 1986 revival went on to achieve great acclaim, and was nominated for Tony Awards for both Best Score and Best Book.\nFurber made his first entry into songwriting with the Australian born composer A. Emmett Adams.  Following a visit to St. Mary's Church, Southampton, England in 1914, the two wrote \"The Bells of St. Mary's\". The song was published in 1917.  This became a major hit in the United States despite having been originally rejected by the publishers.  In 1945, Bing Crosby had a hit with \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" after it was used as the title song to the film of the same name.\nOther hits included \"Limehouse Blues\" from 1924, written with composer Philip Braham.\nFurber also made a few appearances on stage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Limehouse", "response": ["The area inspired Douglas Furber (lyricist) and Philip Braham (composer) in 1921 to write the popular jazz standard \"Limehouse Blues\", which was introduced by Jack Buchanan and Gertrude Lawrence in the musical revue \"A to Z\". Much later, it was reprised in the ballet \"Limehouse Blues\" featuring Fred Astaire and Lucille Bremer in the musical film Ziegfeld Follies (1946) and by Julie Andrews in Star! (1968). In both instances the actors were in yellowface. Other notable performances on film include those by Hoagy Carmichael in To Have and Have Not (1944) and by Borrah Minevich and His Harmonica Rascals in One in a Million (1936). Limehouse Blues was also the name of a 1934 film, starring George Raft."]}, {"page": "1966 in music", "response": ["|\"Leaning on the Lamp Post\" \u2013 Herman's Hermits|| ||w. L.
