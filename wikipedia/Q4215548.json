Karnehm was also a professional snooker and billiards player.Besides his commentary, perhaps his major contribution to the game was his development of the swivel-lens glasses, which enabled Dennis Taylor to win the World Snooker Championship in 1985. These were spectacles which were set at a compensatory angle, so the player could look along the shot through the optical centre of the lens. The originals had been designed by Theodore Hamblin, and pioneered by Fred Davis in 1938. Karnehm, who had served a five-year spectacle-making apprenticeship, made many pairs in his family business, but his upside-down design was a considerable improvement - it offered wider peripheral vision - and helped Taylor win the 1985 world title.Despite being best known to snooker audiences, Karnehm's passion was billiards.  As a non-professional player, he was a ten-time London Amateur Billiards Champion, and also won the English Amateur Billiards Championship in 1969. That October, he took the IBSF World Billiards Championship title.Karnehm turned professional in 1970, and was a challenger for the world title in 1971 and 1973, losing to Leslie Driffield and Rex Williams respectively. He was Chairman of the Billiards Association and Control Council when the Council nominated Leslie Driffield as the challenger to reigning champion Rex Williams for the professional Billiards Championship. Williams declined to play Driffield within the five months time limit that the BA&CC Council had set, which expired on 7 July 1970, and forfeited the title, which was then contested between Driffield and Karnehm in June 1971. On 1 October 1970, the Professional Billiard Players Association, which had been reestablished in 1968 Williams and seven other players, disaffiliated from the BA&CC. It changed its name to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association on 12 December 1970, and declared itself the governing body for the professional game, recognising Williams as champion. Driffield and Karnehm were, at first, the only two professionals to recognise the BA&CC's authority over the game.In 1980, Karnehm beat Williams to win the UK Billiards Championship, his only professional title.Karnehm also turned professional in snooker in 1971, his best result coming when losing 4\u20135 to Chris Ross in the U.K. Championship of 1977.Karnehm is perhaps best known for his one-liner when he was commentating on a match between Cliff Thorburn and Terry Griffiths, at the Crucible in 1983. The match was famous because, during the match, Thorburn completed the first maximum at the Crucible. As Thorburn lined up to pot the black, Karnehm uttered the words: 'Good luck, mate'.Karnehm was also a noted snooker coach, and, in 1985, released an instructional video, 'Understanding Modern Snooker'. He continued to coach, and was still President of the Radstock Billiards association until 2000. He died suddenly in 2002, aged 85, after an afternoon working on his garden in extreme heat.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 18", "response": ["*  1917   \u2013 Jack Karnehm, English snooker player and sportscaster (d. 2002)"]}, {"page": "Tufnell Park", "response": ["* Jack Karnehm, snooker commentator, was born in Tufnell Park"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Jack Karnehm \u2013 BBC Sport 1978\u20131994"]}, {"page": "World Snooker Championship", "response": ["Cliff Thorburn made the first maximum break of the World Championship in 1983 during his second-round match against Terry Griffiths. The importance of this achievement at the time is demonstrated by the fact that play was stopped on the other table. This was the break that gave the World Championship one of its most iconic words of commentary, \"oh, good luck mate\" on the final black, courtesy of Jack Karnehm. Thorburn beat Griffiths in a final-frame decider, a match that finished at 03:51, the latest-ever finish for a match at the Crucible. Thorburn then also won his quarter-final and semi-final matches in the deciding frame; exhausted, and deflated by the news that his wife had suffered a miscarriage, he faced a one-sided final against Steve Davis who won 18\u20136. The 1984 final was between Steve Davis and Jimmy White (in his first final). Davis led 12\u20134 after the first day but White won seven of the eight frames on the final afternoon.

The commentator was Ted Lowe with the highlight programmes presented by Alan Weeks. The 1978 championship was the first to have daily BBC TV coverage with 14 nightly highlights programmes as well as Saturday afternoon coverage on Grandstand. Ted Lowe commentated while the programmes were presented by David Vine and Alan Weeks. In 1979, TV coverage was extended to include an early-evening \"Frame of the Day\" as well as live coverage of parts of the final. David Vine was the presenter while the commentary team was extended to include Jack Karnehm and Clive Everton. In 1980, TV coverage included daily live coverage for the first time.

For some years commentary was primarily by Ted Lowe, Clive Everton and Jack Karnehm although John Pulman, Vera Selby and others were used. In 1986 Jim Meadowcroft, John Spencer and John Virgo were used as summarisers. From 2001 to 2009 the BBC coverage was hosted by Hazel Irvine or Ray Stubbs. From 2010, Hazel Irvine took over with highlights presented by Rishi Persad. In February 2013, the BBC announced that Rishi Persad had been replaced by Jason Mohammad, who himself later stepped down from those duties after the conclusion of the 2019 Masters and was replaced by Seema Jaswal.

Everton has described Reardon in his early career as a \"deadly long potter\", and praised his \"the nerve with which he identified and seizes frame winning openings.\" Jack Karnehm wrote that Reardon achieved \"complete and utter dominance of the game\" by 1976, and \"had a determination and will to win unequalled since the heyday of Joe Davis.\" Williams and Gadsby describe Reardon as \"without doubt the most successful snooker player of the 1970s\" and claim \"he set new standards for mental fortitude\" in the game."]}, {"page": "List of snooker players", "response": ["*Jack Karnehm"]}, {"page": "Rex Williams", "response": ["Leslie Driffield was nominated as the BA&CC challenger to Williams for the professional Billiards Championship.

In 1953, a Sports Argus match report described Wilson as having \"lived up to his reputation as the finest potter in the country, one ball being hardly in the pocket before the next one was following it in.\" Wilson's obituary in The Times noted that in the 1950s he was seen as a \"phenomenal talent\" and played an attacking game that was unlike the defensive approach generally prevalent at the time, and Eurosport's Desmond Kane included him in a 2020 list of the ten \"greatest long potters\". Jack Karnehm in 1981 wrote that Wilson was \"probably the hardest hitter of a ball on earth.

As an amateur player, he won junior titles in English billiards, and the Welsh billiards title several times. He was five-times runner up in the English amateur billiards championship, and twice a semi-finalist at the world amateur championship. In snooker, he partnered Roger Bales as they won the United Kingdom National Pairs Championship.

According to Everton, he was sacked at the instigation of Jack Karnehm, the Chairman of the Billiards and Snooker Control Council (as the Billiards Association and Control Council had renamed itself) for \"giving professionals publicity\". In Everton's account, this followed him including picture of four professional players on the cover of Billiards and Snooker at a time when the Billiards and Snooker Control Council and the professional players were in dispute over the World Billiards Championship. This dispute led to the Professional Billiards Players Association renaming itself as the WPBSA and splitting from the Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&SCC). Following his sacking, Everton established his own magazine, World Snooker. In 1972, the B&SCC approached Everton to take over Billiards and Snooker and paid him \u00a31,000 to do so. Everton merged Billiards and Snooker and World Snooker into Snooker Scene, which published its first issue in April 1972. Snooker Scene has sometimes featured criticisms of the WPBSA which have led to legal disputes. As of August 2021, he remains as editor of Snooker Scene. Everton has said of Snooker Scene: \"I had started this as a simple journal of record of what was happening on the table, but it became a crusading vehicle \u2026 Taking Wisden and Private Eye as our models we sometimes made our point through hard reporting, sometimes through satire.\""]}, {"page": "1981 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["The two-time World Amateur Champion Ray Edmonds had never beaten John Spencer in a match, and had lost to him twice in the final of the English Amateur Championship.
