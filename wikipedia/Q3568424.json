Born in Derry, Ireland, he joined as a surgeon's mate in 1791 at the age of 18.

However, when the storm blew up, many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the shoals. A few of them were recaptured, some by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews, others by ships sallying from C\u00e1diz. Surgeon William Beatty heard Nelson murmur, \"Thank God I have done my duty\"; when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded, and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Nelson's chaplain, Alexander Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as \"God and my country.\". It has been suggested by Nelson historian Craig Cabell that Nelson was actually reciting his own prayer as he fell into his death coma, as the words 'God' and 'my country' are closely linked therein. Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after being hit."]}, {"page": "Beatty", "response": ["* George William Beatty (1887\u20131955), pioneer aviator who set early altitude and distance records", "* John William Beatty (1869-1941), Canadian painter", "* William Beatty (surgeon) (1773-1842), British Navy surgeon serving with Lord Nelson", "* William Beatty (Ontario politician) (1835-1898), Canadian businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "William Beatty", "response": ["William Beatty may refer to:", "*Sir William Beatty (surgeon) (1773\u20131842), Irish surgeon in the Royal Navy", "*William Beatty (Ontario politician) (1835\u20131898), member of the 1st Parliament of Ontario", "*William Beatty (Pennsylvania politician) (1787\u20131851), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania"]}, {"page": "John Pollard (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["Pollard, in an 1863 letter to The Times, stated that Collingwood had left the poop deck prior to the death of the French sniper.

He was mortally wounded by an enemy sniper, dying slowly and remaining conscious throughout, surrounded by his chaplain and staff officers. His last thoughts covered matters such as final directions for his fleet, his hopes and fears for his family, and his personal desire for absolution and reassurance. The events were recorded by several of those present, including the surgeon, William Beatty, and later interpreted in dramatic paintings, both of the death scene, such as those by Benjamin West, and Arthur William Devis, and of allegorical depictions of Nelson's ascent into immortality as a result of his glorious death, including works by West, and Scott Legrand. When news arrived in Britain the initial joy at the news of the victory was stifled by the report of his death, and a state funeral was immediately planned. Nelson was to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral, in a grand ceremony that was not just a mere funeral but was intended to 'capture the essence, the spirit, and the name of Nelson for the nation.' A special coffin was devised, heavily decorated with emblems and symbols of Nelson's many victories. It enclosed the simpler coffin, given to Nelson by Benjamin Hallowell, and was itself enclosed in a grand sarcophagus made for Cardinal Wolsey. When Nelson was laid in state at Greenwich Hospital, a crowd of 30,000 arrived to pay their respects. The subsequent funeral was one of the grandest ever staged, costing some \u00a314,000 and attended by large numbers of admirals, captains and members of royalty."]}, {"page": "Alexander John Scott", "response": ["Scott initially went below at the start of the battle to be with the wounded as they were brought to the cockpit.

He remained with Nelson during his last hours, supporting him and rubbing his chest. After Nelson had died and the surgeon, William Beatty was summoned, Scott was found to be still rubbing the chest.
