Anna Maria was one of the first European women to publish an eyewitness account of her experiences in West Africa with her husband, a previous surgeon on a slave ship who later became an abolitionist. Anna Maria\u2019s writing of the two voyages were used in the campaign to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Ironically, she defended the slave trade in her own narrative called the Two Voyages to the River Sierra Leone during the Years 1791\u20131792\u20131793. Specifically relating to the type of slave auction called the scramble, Christopher Fyfe, a Scottish historian who specializes in West African history, gives a description of it from Anna Maria Falconbridge\u2019s perspective.Christopher Fyfe, \"Sale of the Slaves\" in Anna Maria Falconbridge (2017), 216. The scrambles witnessed were in Jamaica, one in Kingston, and the other in Port Maria. For the scramble in Kingston, the slaves were all collected upon the main and quarter deck of the ship where it was darkened (in order to prevent potential buyers from clearly seeing the slaves). Once the signal was given for the scramble to commence, the buyers rushed in. Slaves were so terrified that almost thirty of them jumped ship. The scramble in Port Maria was conducted similarly to the one in Kingston. Only this time, the situation of the slaves was more described. Fyfe describes the women as being terrified, clinging to one another in protection, and in great agony. The buyers are described as savages because of the brutal way they rushed on the slaves to grab and eventually purchase them.", "Alexandre Lindo, a ship captain for two slave ships, records selling an entire ship of captives in four hours, which was the largest amount of bondspeople sold until 1805 when thirty plantation owners bought an entire human cargo's worth in one hour, the slaves from both ships being sold by the scramble method.Alexander Falconbridge, \"Disposal of Sick Slaves,\" in An Account of the Slave Trade on the Coast of Africa, edited by Steven Mintz, (london: 1789).", "Alexander Falconbridge, husband of Anna Maria Falconbridge, who were both surgeons for four different voyages, recounts the scramble slave auction in his book, An Account of the Slave Trade on the Coast of Africa. He states that buyers would pay a fixed price for the captives that was negotiated among the ship's captains and the purchasers. Falconbridge relates that at the agreed start hour the doors of the yard where the captives were held were thrown open and the buyers instantly ran in to gather bondspeople. Some buyers came prepared by bringing handkerchiefs or ropes so they could tie the slaves together without losing them while grabbing others. Falconbridge calls the buyers \"brutes\" who had no form of sympathy for the captives; because of this, he recalls some of the enslaved to be so frightened that they would jump over the walls to escape. On the ship Golden Age, Falconbridge records the selling of 503 captives in two days in December 1784 at Port Maria, Jamaica.", "* Alexander Falconbridge"]}, {"page": "Sierra Leone Creole people", "response": ["However, before the ships sailed away from Sierra Leone, 50 white women had died, and about 250 remained of the original 440 who left Plymouth.

In early 1791 Alexander Falconbridge returned, to find only 64 of the original residents (39 black men, 19 black women, and six white women). The 64 people had been cared for by a Greek and a colonist named Thomas Kallingree at Fourah Bay, an abandoned African village. There the settlers reestablished Granville Town.

Many of these freedmen ended up poor and destitute. In 1786 Granville Sharp published a plan to resettle these former soldiers in Sierra Leone. He proposed that the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor, a humanitarian aid society, sponsor a colony. After purchasing a plot of land on the Peninsula of Sierra Leone from the local chiefs, 364 one-acre lots were laid out on the southern side of the river and distributed to colonists in 1787. Illness, deaths of their leaders, a lack of supplies, and threats from native inhabitants caused the colonists to desert the site in 1789. The St. George's Bay Company organised with plans to rescue the settlers and establish a commercial trading venture with the colony. Alexander Falconbridge, the agent for the company set out in 1790 and collected the colonists he could find on Bobs and Bunce Islands. He resettled the sixty-four colonists at Granville Town, after purchasing the land from the local chiefs. "]}]}}
