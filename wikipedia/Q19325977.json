At the age of sixteen, he was articled to the ecclesiastical architect George Edmund Street, prominent in the Arts and Crafts movement particularly interested in metalwork. He subsequently moved to the office of John Pollard Seddon, who worked in the Gothic revival style. There, he befriended C.F.A. Voysey, whose designs he later implemented. He then worked for a while for the Royal Engineers as a draftsman before joining Gardner's metalworks in his late twenties.\nAbout this time Reynolds met the architect Hugh Roumieu Gough who was subsequently to build the church of St Cuthbert's, Philbeach Gardens where Reynolds contributed to the design of the fittings over many years. Voysey, who wrote Reynolds' obituary for The Times, described him as having 'a profound reverence for ceremonial and symbolism'. His style slowly changed from neo-Gothic to early Art Nouveau. He became active in the Art-Workers' Guild which promoted the arts and crafts ideal of integrated art, life, and work.\nHis screen and lectern for St Cuthbert's was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as 'much more playful' than most arts and crafts designers.He set up his own business, eventually creating the Manor House Metal Works, Clapham, describing himself as 'Art Metal Worker and Bronze Founder' in the 1911 census. He became very successful and his metalwork features in many cathedrals and churches. His patrons included almost every important architect of the period.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Reynolds", "response": ["*William Bainbridge Reynolds (1855\u20131935), English metal craftsman and engineer"]}, {"page": "Port Lympne Mansion", "response": ["Cut out of the old sea cliffs there are 15.5 acres of gardens.  William Bainbridge Reynolds, who had designed the metal work for the Law Courts, undertook all of the wrought-ironwork in and around the Mansion. The garden planting was designed by Norah Lindsay, who recreated the feel of Italy by setting herbaceous plants against the dark background created by the terraced hedges. Norah also advised Philip on his Trent Park garden, which was thirteen miles from the center of London in New Barnet.  When John Aspinall (zoo owner) purchased the house in 1973 he began a ten-year renovation project.  The great border which is 135 yards in all was dug over twice by hand and piled with 200 tons of Elephant dung and were redesigned and replanted with 2,500 herbs and shrubs with the advice of Russell Page."]}, {"page": "St Cuthbert's, Earls Court", "response": ["The Church was built 1884\u201387, designed by the architect Hugh Roumieu Gough (1843\u20131904), son of Alexander Dick Gough. The interior furnishings designed by William Bainbridge Reynolds (1845\u20131935) who was a member of the congregation.  It has been hailed as Jewel of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.", "The most unusual feature of Gough's design was a great blank arch in the east wall, furnished externally with niches for statues instead of window lights. At first the interior walling was finished off in plain brick, in anticipation of decorative glories to come. Some rich fittings had been installed by the date of consecration, notably the Caen stone pulpit, designed apparently by Gough and carved by Baron Felix de Sziemanowicz of Kennington (placed in continental fashion almost halfway down the nave, as though to distance it from the altar), some carving outside the Lady Chapel and the sedilia and piscina on the south of the Sanctuary (1888).The soundingboard designed by J. Harold Gibbons and made by Pearson, Brown and Company of Manchester was added in 1907.  The seven sacrament font in its baptistery all designed by Gough and carved by Sziemanowicz with panels 'after M\u00fcller's pictures at D\u00fcsseldorf', (1888), the walls were still plain brick. Lighting was by means of metal gas fittings (1887) looking rather like open thimbles, which have sadly long since vanished. They were provided by the firm of J. Starkie Gardner, for whom they had been designed by William Bainbridge Reynolds."]}]}}
