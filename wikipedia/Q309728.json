Of the club's record signing Rio Ferdinand, he said, \"Just because you are paid \u00a3120,000-a-week and play well for 20 minutes against Tottenham, you think you are a superstar.\" The outburst was deemed too damning by the United management and was subsequently pulled from transmission by the club's TV station.

Meanwhile, Keane carried on his trend of buying ex-Manchester United players with the addition of Kieran Richardson, Paul McShane, Danny Higginbotham and Phil Bardsley.
