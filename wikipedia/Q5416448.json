In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop Colin Winter to house the Namibia International Peace Centre. In 1978, the Astor family sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a non-profit charity led by Dr. Fred Blum and Bishop Stephen Verney. The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a spiritual retreat and conference centre, and changed its name to 'The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay' in the 1990s. The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a spiritual community offers hospitality to people seeking personal growth, spiritual refreshment and healing. The Abbey also runs a programme of events for the public in the areas of spirituality, personal development, education, and music and the arts."]}, {"page": "Lesley Manville", "response": ["| 2014 || Fleming || Evelyn St. Croix Fleming || 4 episodes"]}, {"page": "Evelyn St.Croix Fleming", "response": ["#REDIRECT Evelyn St. Croix Fleming"]}, {"page": "Evelyn Ste Croix Fleming", "response": ["#REDIRECT Evelyn St. Croix Fleming"]}, {"page": "Eve Fleming", "response": ["#REDIRECT Evelyn St. Croix Fleming"]}]}}
