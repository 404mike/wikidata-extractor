However the paper was blocked by Arthur's superior, William Henry Preece of the Post Office, because part of the proposal was that loading coils (inductors) should be added to telephone and telegraph lines to increase their self-induction and correct the distortion which they suffered. Preece had recently declared self-inductance to be the great enemy of clear transmission. Heaviside was also convinced that Preece was behind the sacking of the editor of The Electrician which brought his long-running series of articles to a halt (until 1891). There was a long history of animosity between Preece and Heaviside.  Heaviside considered Preece to be mathematically incompetent, an assessment supported by the biographer Paul J. Nahin: \"Preece was a powerful government official, enormously ambitious, and in some remarkable ways, an utter blockhead.\" Preece's motivations in suppressing Heaviside's work were more to do with protecting Preece's own reputation and avoiding having to admit error than any perceived faults in Heaviside's work."]}, {"page": "History of radio", "response": ["* William Henry Preece"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*William Henry Preece (1834\u20131913)"]}, {"page": "Wimbledon, London", "response": ["*Sir William Henry Preece (1834\u20131913), developed English telephone system; Blue Plaque at Gothic Lodge, 6 Woodhayes Road."]}, {"page": "List of electrical engineers", "response": ["| William Henry Preece|| Telegraphy, nemesis of Heaviside "]}, {"page": "David Edward Hughes", "response": ["Hughes was born in 1831, the son of a musically talented family hailing originally from Y Bala (the place of birth was either London or Corwen, Denbighshire), and emigrated to the United States at the age of seven.  At only six years old, he is known to have played the harp and english concertina to a very high standard.  At an early age, Hughes developed such musical ability that he is reported to have attracted attention of Herr Hast, an eminent German pianist in America, who procured for him a professorship of music at St. Joseph's College in Bardstown, Kentucky.  Hughes also worked as a practical experimenter, coming up with the printing telegraph in 1855.  He moved back to London in 1857 to sell his invention, and worked on the transmission of sound over wires.  He worked on microphones and on the invention of the induction balance (later used in metal detectors).  Despite Hughes' facility as an experimenter, he had little mathematical training.
