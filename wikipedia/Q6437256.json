In May, John Rockwell of the New York Times published a rave review, saying: \"What the Ramones do is deliver a nonstop set of short, brisk, monochromatically intense songs. ... conventional considerations of pace and variety are thrown calculatedly to the winds. The ingredients are simplicity itself.\" Rockwell noted: \"the effect in the end amounts to an abstraction of rock so pure that other associations get left behind.\" Nick Kent favourably commented in the NME: \"This record poses a direct threat to any vaguely sensitive woofer and/or tweeter lodged in your hi-fi ...\". Reviewing that same month in The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said that, while the power of the band's music draws from \"fairly ominous sources\" like Nazi imagery and brutality, he cannot deny the \"sheer pleasure\" of the music: \"For me, it blows everything else off the radio: it's clean the way the Dolls never were, sprightly the way the Velvets never were, and just plain listenable the way Black Sabbath never was.\" In July, Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone wrote in 1976 that the album was similar to early rock and roll, and was constructed using rhythm tracks of great intensity.Nelson, Paul (1976-07-29). \"Ramones\".

Harrington declared that the album was a huge landmark for music history, proclaiming that \"[it] split the history of rock 'n' roll in half.\" Theunis Bates, a writer for Time, summed the album up with: \"Ramones stripped rock back to its basic elements\u00a0... lyrics are very simple, boiled-down declarations of teen lust and need.\" Bates also said that it \"is the ultimate punk statement.\"Ramones advertising art.

In a contemporary review, Rolling Stone critic Billy Altman considered that \"purely on its own terms, Lust for Life is a successful album\", but complained that Pop's \"new stance is so utterly unchallenging and cautious\". By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice refuted the critical opinion that Pop's \"creative power has dissipated\", finding The Idiot and Lust for Life to be more consistent than Pop's albums with the Stooges. He later noted that of the two, he preferred Lust for Life \"because it's faster and more assertive\u2014which means, among other things, that the nihilistic satire is counteracted by the forward motion of the music itself\". Kris Needs of ZigZag magazine felt Lust for Life is not as \"consistent\" as its predecessor. He nevertheless considered the album one of his favorite albums of 1977, finding it to be more of a \"day\" record with its predecessor being a \"night\" record. In Sounds magazine, Pete Makowski praised the record, calling it \"excellent\". He complimented the band's performance and Pop's vocals, labeling them \"a bit jagged but powerful\". Writing for NME, Max Bell gave the record a positive review, calling it \"quite good\". He praised Pop's greater role compared to The Idiot, as well as his vocal performance. However, he was critical of some tracks, including \"Some Weird Sin\", \"Tonight\", and \"Success\", the last of which he considered \"'Fame' revisited\"."]}, {"page": "Some Girls", "response": ["Writing for Circus magazine, Nick Tosches gave praise to the record, calling it their best in five years: \"After five years, the rhythm is back, and satisfaction and shelter are once again just out of reach.\" He further wrote that Some Girls more than makes up for the group's prior works. After Black and Blue, Richard Riegel of Creem called Some Girls a return to \"refreshingly kinetic rock 'n' roll\". He further gave praise to Jagger's vocal performances and Wood's contributions on guitar. In Sounds, Peter Silverton spoke positively of the record, highlighting \"Miss You\" as the standout. He concluded: \"Because they recorded so quickly (by their standards) they've achieved an immediacy on this which has been sorely lacking on their last few studio albums. It's far from great but it's certainly better than we had any right to expect after all these years.\" Kris Needs, in a review for ZigZag magazine, complimented the album's consistency when compared to its three predecessors. Needs further praised the lyrics as improvements over their prior works. NMEs Charles Shaar Murray gave the album a more mixed assessment. Although he agreed it was their finest work since Exile on Main St., he felt it was more a Jagger solo record than a proper Rolling Stones record, praising his singing and Watts's drumming. Nevertheless, he considered the production a step up from Black and Blue and gave high praise to \"Shattered\"."]}, {"page": "Axis: Bold as Love", "response": ["Critics also found Axis: Bold as Love to be the least memorable of the Experience's three studio releases. According to Richie Unterberger, it was the least impressive from the Experience, while Kris Needs called the record a \"transitional, but often overlooked, masterpiece\". Reviewing Hendrix's back catalogue in 2005 for Blender, Robert Christgau acknowledged the adequate production and guitar quality on the album, and praised the fluidity of Mitchell's drumming; he criticised, however, the music's \"spaced-out lightness\", and the brevity of some tracks: \"half the songs are forgettable as songs if fine as recordings.\""]}, {"page": "The Idiot (album)", "response": ["Because Bowie and Alomar mostly wrote \"Sister Midnight\", it is similar to the funk style of Bowie's tracks \"Fame\" and \"Stay\", described by Seabrook and O'Leary as the song most representative of Bowie's pre-Berlin period. Its lack of overtly electronic instrumentation belied what critic Dave Thompson described as a \"defiantly futuristic ambience\". Bowie wrote the first lyrics of the opening verse of \"Sister Midnight\" while on tour; Pop completed them in the studio. Reviewers have compared Pop's vocal performance to Jim Morrison of the Doors. Author Peter Doggett writes the identity of \"Sister Midnight\" is irrelevant, explaining that \"she was merely a cipher, who could send [Pop] soaring to the moon or falling to Earth... without either journey seeming to register on his emotions\". The Krautrock-influenced \"Nightclubbing\" is considered a forerunner to what Bowie would explore on Low. The riff has been described as a mischievous take on Gary Glitter's \"Rock and Roll\". Kris Needs described it as \"the bleak sound of the 1985 disco, as ghostly electronic washes sky-write phrases over an unsettling, distorted disco pulse\". Lyrically, Pop described \"Nightclubbing\" as \"my comment on what it was like hanging out with him every night\" and \"about the incredible coldness and deathly feeling you have after you've done something like that and how much you enjoy it. It could be Los Angeles or Paris or New York or anywhere, really.\"", "Critical reception to The Idiot was largely positive, although it did confuse a number of reviewers. Doggett writes that listeners' perceptions of Pop generally influenced their views on the record. In a contemporary review of the album, John Swenson of Rolling Stone termed it \"the most savage indictment of rock posturing ever recorded\" and \"a necrophiliac's delight\". In Melody Maker, Allan Jones praises the record as a \"disturbingly pertinent expression of modern music\". Strick positively compared The Idiot to Pop's prior work with the Stooges, noting the difference in his vocal performance: \"[He] doesn't sound alive... he sounds automated.\" He further complimented Pop's lyricism, stating, \"Iggy's got the tainted charisma of a dead poet.\" Like Strick, Riegel noted the difference in The Idiot and Raw Power, writing: \"Where Raw Power represented the final apotheosis of the Detroit-metal rock band, The Idiot puts Iggy right out in front as a kind of rarefied, continent-seasoned singer-songwriter.\" Similar to other reviewers, Kris Needs of ZigZag magazine was perplexed upon hearing The Idiot for the first time, noting the major difference between it and Pop's work with the Stooges. Calling it \"a very strange, morbid, obscure and unsettling [album]\", Needs praised the record, stating he listened to it on repeat for hours at a time, and it \"chill[ed] [him] to the marrow\". In a more mixed review, Stephen Demorest of Phonograph Record said he enjoyed the record, due to its \"completely schizophrenic\" nature. He called \"China Girl\" the highlight of the album, but felt other tracks were not among Pop's finest: \"It's a mixture of bluff... and beauty.\""]}, {"page": "\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)", "response": ["On release, \"Heroes\" received very positive reviews from music critics. Allan Jones of Melody Maker named it \"album of the year\", calling it and its predecessor \"among the most adventurous and notably challenging records yet thrust upon the rock audience.\" Angus MacKinnon of NME also named it the magazine's \"album of the year\", calling it Bowie's \"most moving performance in years\" and commended the artist's growing maturity. Kris Needs of ZigZag magazine further praised the record, noting that Bowie appeared to be continuing the musical explorations of Low, while at the same time, allowing listeners time to \"catch up with Low.\" Needs ultimately described the album as \"a strange, cold sometimes impenetrable album, but Bowie makes all these unlikely ingredients work.\" Writing in Hit Parader, American musician and author Patti Smith praised it as \"a cryptic product of a high order of intelligence.\""]}, {"page": "Low (David Bowie album)", "response": ["Buckley describes the sound, particularly evident on \"Speed of Life\", \"Breaking Glass\" and \"Sound and Vision\", as \"revolutionary\" and \"stunning\".

Trynka writes that Davis's \"spirit and energy\" propel the album's first side \"ever onward\". On its release, Kris Needs of ZigZag magazine called the drum sound one of the best sounds he had ever heard; Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone later described it as \"one of rock's all-time most imitated drum sounds\".", "Bowie's musical direction perplexed some reviewers. Rockwell felt that Bowie's fans would find Low was his \"finest work\" after they overcame their \"shock\" at hearing it for the first time. In National RockStar, David Hancock was surprised the record was Bowie's, calling it \"his most bizarre and adventurous LP\" yet. Kris Needs in ZigZag described Low as strange and shocking but believed it was one of Bowie's greatest achievements.  Phonograph Records Bud Scoppa felt the album made little sense. He found it \"the most intimate and free recording this extraordinary artist has yet made\", and believed listeners would be \"baffled\" by it or \"give in\" to it."]}, {"page": "Rebel Rebel", "response": ["The song's distinctive guitar riff is described by rock journalist Kris Needs as \"a classic stick-in-the-head like the Stones' 'Satisfaction'\".Kris Needs (1983). Bowie: A Celebration: p.29 The riff's chords are D, E, and A and were created by Bowie and enhanced by Parker, who, according to Doggett, added the \"downward trail\" at the end of each line. Paul Trynka writes that Parker added \"a particular chord shape rather than the original single note just before the chord change and a distinctive 'beeeoonng' in the last line of the chorus just as [Bowie] sings 'I love you so'.\" Bowie later said, \"It's a fabulous riff! Just fabulous! When I stumbled onto it, it was 'Oh, thank you!\" Parker later said Bowie came up with the Stones-like riff to \"piss off\" Mick Jagger. Parker was upset upon learning he was uncredited on the final version. He stated: \"I can tell my own playing, and my own sound, and I know it's me.\" Flowers further recalled: \"David played the riff to Alan, Alan made sure it was good enough to record, then [Alan] played it.\" Although O'Leary compliments the riff, he notes that with Ronson's absence, it gets \"run into the ground\"; throughout the song's over four-minute runtime, the riff is solely absent in the two bridges and the \"hot tramp\" lines."]}, {"page": "1916 (album)", "response": ["In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Alex Henderson gave it three stars out of five: \"The band's sound hadn't changed much, and time hadn't made its sledgehammer approach any less appealing... whether the subject matter is humorously fun or more serious, Mot\u00f6rhead is as inspired as ever on 1916.\" Reviewing a reissue on the Hear No Evil label,discogs.com/Mot\u00f6rhead-1916/release/6242179 Kris Needs wrote in Classic Rock: \"One of their most well-rounded sets, this memorabilia-stacked reissue comes with two non-album belters, 'Eagle Rock' and runaway hell train 'Dead Man's Hand'.\""]}, {"page": "Martin Rev", "response": ["In 2008, while Martin was working on the album Stigmata, his wife Mari died.

The band was in the studio while their debut single \"Hong Kong Garden\" was released. Lillywhite was recruited because he recorded the drums in a different way. He asked drummer Kenny Morris to play the bass drum and the snare drum first. Then he did the cymbals and the tom-toms later. Journalist Kris Needs noted that Lillywhite used \"deep echo\" on drums.", "Music historian Simon Goddard described the music on The Scream as a \"claustrophobic abyss of angst and angularity\", saying it was part of a triptych of albums layering the foundations of post-punk. The opening cut, \"Pure\", had a spacious, atmospheric sound. Journalist Miranda Sawyer noted that Siouxsie's \"vocals came from a distance\", that \"there was a lot of space\" and that \"the sound was big and slow\". Music journalist Ian Birch wrote that \"Pure\" was  an atmosphere piece; \"a snarling, predatory bass stalks its ground before it's met by teeth-grinding guitar splinters, and the distant footfall of drums. Siouxsie's voice becomes an instrument.\" Music journalist Kris Needs remarked that at the end, it seeps out into \"Jigsaw Feeling\", a \"song of disorientation and bewilderment\" with a \"huge, sometimes awe-inspiring sound\". On \"Metal Postcard\", there is a \"motorik austerity\" in the rhythm patterns. The last song, \"Switch\", was arranged in three different sections, \"for the different people who swap jobs with terrible results - scientists, general practitioner and vicar\".", "The Scream was named \"the best debut album of the year\" by Sounds. Reviewer Peter Silverton gave the album 5 stars out of 5, and the paper listed it at No. 2 in its end-of-year best album list. Record Mirror also published a 5-star review, saying: The Scream \"points to the future, real music for the new age. [...] It is vital, it's moving. It's a ... landmark.\" Chris Westwood praised the cohesion between the words and the music: \"The album's lyrical frame of mind is perfectly reflected in the work of [guitarist] McKay. [Bassist] Severin and [drummer] Morris; constantly shifting, restless, controlled aggression, they are as essential as Siouxsie.\" Melody Maker described the sound as \"strong, abrasive, visceral and constantly inventive, with a thrust that makes the spaces equal partners to the notes\", with the critic comparing the album's textures to that of Wire and Pere Ubu. ZigZag qualified it as a \"magnificent record\", with reviewer Kris Needs writing: \"I can't think of another group who could have made an LP so uncompromising, powerful and disturbing, yet so captivating and enjoyable [...] It is certainly a special classic to join milestones like [David Bowie's] Diamond Dogs, Roxy [Music]'s first and [Lou Reed's] Berlin. This is music of such strength and vision that you just can't not be moved by the time they swing into the final climactic passage of 'Switch', the closing track.\" Needs qualified the sound as \"huge, sometimes awe-inspiring\" and commented that drummer Morris created \"one of the best drum sounds I've ever heard \u2013 the deep echo and floor-shuddering mix accentuating his muted Glitter Band stomp\". Critic Adam Sweeting began his review by saying, \"This is a chilling, intense masterpiece\".

McKay and Kenny Morris withdrew and became uncommunicative with the rest of the band and their manager and co-producer of the album, Nils Stevenson. Unlike the sessions for The Scream, the music was recorded without Siouxsie, as she added her vocals later. Morris did not take part in the mixing sessions, while Siouxsie was heavily involved. Commenting a few days before the album's release, Jon Savage wrote about the music: \"The songs are delivered with the stifling intensity of inner violence in a locked room\".

Singling out the tracks \"Paradise Place\" and \"Skin\", Hewitt called them \"classic Banshee pieces. Hypnotic, relentless and incisive\". Writing for ZigZag, Kris Needs hailed it as \"probably the most varied, diverse and adventurous offering yet to shimmer under the Banshees' banner\", praising the band's new musical direction: \"If anything, it makes its two predecessors, seem a trifle one-dimensional now. Tracks veer from the lightest electronic backdrop pulse to surging soundwalls as mesmeric and powerful as anything they've done. But the subtlety evident in 'Happy House' and marvellous 'Christine' are the pointers to the main content of 'Kaleidoscope'\". Needs noted that Siouxsie's voice \"gained new strength and depth, but she's also widened beyond singing and writing to include synth, piano and a spot of guitar\"."]}]}}
