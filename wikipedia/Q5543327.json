In particular, weaker members of the Qajar dynasty often did not rule much beyond the capital Tehran, a fact exploited by the imperial powers Britain and Russia in the 19th century. For example, when British cartographers, diplomats, and telegraph workers traveled along Iran's southern coast in the early 19th century laden with guns and accompanied by powerful ships, some local chieftains quickly calculated that their sworn allegiance to the Shah in Tehran with its accompanying tax burden might be optional. When queried, they proclaimed their own local authority.\"Memorandum by the Rev.

Early in 1843 an attempt by Zaya to reform the church calendar by adopting the Western date for Easter aroused strong resentment among the Mosul Chaldeans, and provoked a movement, in which the Anglican missionary George Percy Badger was implicated, to depose him and replace him with Yohannan Hormizd's nephew Eliya.  Eliya was unwilling to challenge the patriarch's authority, and Zaya's opponents turned instead to the Nestorian patriarch Shemon XVII Abraham, then a refugee in Mosul, urging him to lay claim to the patriarchate himself.  Zaya and the French missionaries who supported him complained vigorously to the Turkish authorities, and wrote to the British embassy in Constantinople to protest at Badger's interference.  The Turkish government was initially reluctant to intervene, because of Zaya's ambiguous status as a Persian national, and Zaya finally took his cause to Constantinople, where through the influence of the French embassy he obtained a firman recognising the Chaldean church as a separate millet and acknowledging him as patriarch.
