There has, however, been some contention as to whether the name  (Jesus) in the 'missing' portions of recto lines 2 and 5 was originally written as ; in other words, was it contracted to  or  in accordance with otherwise universal Christian practice in surviving early Gospel manuscripts. On the assumption that the nomina sacra were absent from \ud835\udd13, Roberts originally considered that the divine name was more likely to have been written in full,Roberts(1935), p. 18. but later changed his mind.Hurtado, p. 6.

No two of the four contain the same exact text as reconstructed for John 18:31\u201338, but \ud835\udd13 seems to represent an example of the same proto-Alexandrian text-type.
