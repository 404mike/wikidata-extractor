He has been described as far-right and right-wing by several media publications. Kassam formerly ran in the party's November 2016 leadership election before dropping out of the race on 31 October 2016. He is the former global editor-in-chief of Human Events and most recently became the editor-in-chief of The National Pulse.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Enoch Powell", "response": ["* Raheem Kassam, Enoch Was Right, London, Independently published, 2018."]}, {"page": "Nigel Farage", "response": ["A row subsequently developed within the party, in which MEP and campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn described Farage's public image as \"snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive\" and said he risked turning the party into a \"personality cult\". O'Flynn accused Farage of paying too much attention to advisors that \"would like to take UKIP in the direction of some hard-right, ultra-aggressive American Tea Party-type movement\", singling out the NHS and gun control liberalisation as particular issues. Raheem Kassam, Farage's chief of staff and editor of Breitbart London was later sacked as a result, whilst O'Flynn stated that he continued to support Farage as party leader. Farage also faced a number of calls from senior figures within the party to stand down."]}, {"page": "Human Events", "response": ["In March 2019, political writer Raheem Kassam and lawyer Will Chamberlain purchased Human Events from Salem Media Group for $300,000 with a view of returning Human Events to regular online publication. On May 1, 2019, Human Events was re-launched under the management of Kassam as Global editor-in-chief and Chamberlain as publisher. On August 8, 2019, Human Events announced that Kassam was leaving the outlet, and the Editor-in-Chief responsibilities would be taken over by Chamberlain."]}, {"page": "Raymond Leo Burke", "response": ["In May 2019, Burke said that \"to resist large-scale Muslim immigration in my judgment is to be responsible\" and \"a responsible exercise of one\u2019s patriotism\"; he cited a book called No Go Zones: How Sharia Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You, by former Breitbart News reporter Raheem Kassam, in support of his contention that immigration of Muslims to Europe and the U.S. was harmful. Burke said that Muslim immigration was because Christians were \"no longer ready to defend the moral law\" and expressed fears of demographic shift because \"Christians are not reproducing themselves.\""]}]}}
