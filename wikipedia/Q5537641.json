He was born in the Highland town of Caol near Fort William in Scotland, and played for Aberdeen in the Scottish Football League. He was the youngest player to have ever made their debut for Aberdeen until Fraser Fyvie broke his record. He is one of only three Aberdeen players to have made their debut at 16 years of age.He was nicknamed the White Pele and The Pele of the North because of his unique skill on the ball.\nWhen George signed for South Melbourne Hellas in Australia, he became the most expensive player to enter the country with a transfer fee from Aberdeen to Australian club South Melbourne Hellas for \u00a320,000 (AUD 50,000). The fee was considerable given the 21-year-old planned to stay at the club for only one year before returning to the Scottish Football League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Campbell", "response": ["George Campbell may refer to:", "*George Campbell (rugby union) (1872-1924), Scotland international rugby union player", "*George Campbell (footballer, born 1957), Scottish footballer", "*George Campbell (footballer, born 1864) (1864\u20131898), Scottish footballer", "*George Campbell (footballer, born 1920), Scottish footballer", "*George Campbell (New Zealand footballer), association football player who represented New Zealand", "*George Campbell (lacrosse) (1878\u20131972), Canadian dentist and sportsman", "*George Campbell (cricketer, born 1979), English cricketer", "*George Campbell (cricketer, born 1847) (1847\u20131930), English cricketer", "*George Campbell (American football) (born 1996), high school football All-American", "*George Campbell (soccer) (born 2001), American soccer player", "*George Campbell (Australian politician) (born 1943), senator from the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales", "*George Campbell (New South Wales politician) (1827\u20131890), member of the New South Wales Parliament", "*George Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll (1768\u20131839), Whig MP", "*George Campbell (civil servant) (1824\u20131892), Scottish Member of Parliament", "*George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll (1823\u20131900), Scottish Liberal politician", "*George Campbell (Canadian politician) (1844\u2013?), farmer and political figure in Ontario", "*Sir George Campbell, statesman", "*George Campbell of Inverneill (1803\u20131882), Commandant of the Royal Artillery and served in the East India Company", "*George Campbell (minister) (1719\u20131796), Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, minister, theologian, and professor of divinity", "*Sir George Campbell (Royal Navy officer) (1759\u20131821)", "*George Campbell (1838\u20131915), Congregational minister, father of Alexander Petrie Campbell", "*George Campbell (murder victim) (died 1871), Canadian farmer who was murdered by his wife", "*George Campbell (town marshal) (1850\u20131881), town marshal for El Paso, TX, one of four victims killed in the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight", "*George Campbell (linguist) (1912\u20132004), Scottish polyglot and linguist at the BBC ", "*George Campbell (painter) (1917\u20131979), Irish painter and writer", "*George Campbell Jr. (born 1945), President of the Cooper Union"]}, {"page": "South Melbourne FC", "response": ["The recruitment of Alan Davidson, George Campbell (Aberdeen F.C.), Steve Blair, Branko Buljevic, Alun Evans (Liverpool), and Charlie Egan, helped South Melbourne climb the NSL ladder in the early part of the decade, with South becoming runners up in the NSL in 1981, which was their best ever NSL placing at the time. They also won the Ampol Cup in 1982. Some solid player signings such as (Oscar Crino, Doug Brown, Bobby Russell and John Yzendoorn) gave the club some respectability, but a combination of committee problems and a string of coaches, never allowed the team to settle and gain consistency. South Melbourne finished first on the league ladder in 1984, but in a newly restructured NSL competition, it also had to win the finals series to win the title. The club powered past local rivals Heidelberg United in the Southern Division play-offs, and edged out Sydney Olympic in the Grand Final to win the 1984 national championship.", "After the departure of George Campbell to rivals Preston Makedonia in 1983/84, Branko Buljevic to Footscray Just in 1985 and others, South Melbourne could not repeat the success of the previous year. Despite finishing in first place, it was knocked out of the finals series by local rivals Brunswick Juventus and Preston. A major overhaul by coach Brian Garvey saw a number of new signings being made, including youngsters Paul Trimboli, David Healy, Kimon Taliadoros and Harry Micheil. The young team put in some memorable performances as the decade came to a close, finishing in the top half of the league table, but failed to win another championship.
