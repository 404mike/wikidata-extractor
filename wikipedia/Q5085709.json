His best season was in 1974 when he finished in tenth place in the 500cc world championship on a Yamaha motorcycle. Williams was a nine-time winner at the Isle of Man TT races, although only three of those victories counted towards the world championship. In 1980, he won the Formula II Class of the Formula TT world championship.\nSince racing, Williams has remained a TT personality presenting the breakfast show every week day on Radio TT as well as joining the team for trackside commentary. He owns and has taken an active role in running the Chester store Everything But Bikes since retiring from TT racing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isle of Man TT", "response": ["| Ben Birchall, Tom Birchall, Jim Moodie, Chas Mortimer, Phil Read, Dan Sayle, Charlie Williams", "|rowspan=2|  Charlie Williams", "|  Charlie Williams", "|  Charlie Williams", "|  Charlie Williams"]}, {"page": "North West 200", "response": ["|Charlie Williams", "! 500 cc Charlie Williams", "! 350 cc Charlie Williams", "! 350 cc Charlie Williams"]}, {"page": "1975 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season", "response": ["|  Charlie Williams", "|  Charlie Williams", "| align=\"left\"| Charlie Williams", "| align=\"left\"| Charlie Williams"]}, {"page": "Manx Grand Prix", "response": ["|Rex Adams, Dave Arnold, Mark Baldwin, Brian Ball, Adam Barclay, Nigel Barton,  Nigel Beattie, Simon Beck, Gavin Bell, George Bell, Peter Bell, Alan Bennallick, Dave Bennett, Alan Bennie, Gordon Blackley, Ellis Boyce, Colin Breeze, Derek Brien, Dave Broadhead, Clive Brown, George Buchan, Graham Cannell, Phil Carpenter, John Carr, Gary Carswell, Mike Casey, Alan Cooper, Paul Corrin, George Costain, Dennis Craine, Eddie Crooks, Dickie Dale, Harold Daniell, Gordon Daniels, Peter Darvill, Snuffy Davies, Nigel Davies, Robin Dawson, Tom Dickie, Wayne Dinham, Tommy Diver, H.G.
