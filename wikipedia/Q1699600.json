The American writer Michael Lind wrote about The Pity of War:Like the historian John Charmley, who expressed the same wish in the case of World War II, Ferguson belongs to the fringe element of British conservatism that regrets the absence of a German-British deal in the first half of the 20th century that would have marginalized the United States and might have allowed the British Empire to survive to this day. According to Ferguson, Britain should have stayed out of World War I and allowed Imperial Germany to smash France and Russia and create a continental empire from the Atlantic to the Middle East. The joke is on Ferguson's American conservative admirers, inasmuch as he laments the defeat of the Kaiser's Germany because it accelerated the replacement of the British Empire by the United States of America and the eclipse of the City of London by Wall Street. The German-born American historian Gerhard Weinberg in a review of The Pity of War strongly criticized Ferguson for advancing the thesis that it was idiotic for Britain to have fought a Germany that allegedly posed no danger.Weinberg, Gerhard Review of The Pity of War pages 281-282 from Central European History Volume 33, Issue 02, June 2000 p. 281. Weinberg accused Ferguson of completely ignoring the chief foreign policy aim of Wilhelm II from 1897 onwards, namely Weltpolitik (\"World Politics\") and argued it was absurd for Ferguson to claim that allowing Germany to defeat France and Russia would have posed no danger to Britain. Weinberg wrote that Ferguson was wrong to claim that Germany's interests were limited only to Europe, and maintained that if the Reich did defeat France in 1914, then Germany would have taken over the French colonies in Asia and Africa which would have definitely affected the balance of power all over the world, not just in Europe. Finally, Weinberg attacked Ferguson for claiming that the Tirpitz Plan was not a danger to Britain and that Britain had no reason to fear Germany's naval ambitions, sarcastically asking if that was really the case, then why did the British redeploy so much of their fleet from around the world to the North Sea and spend so much money building warships in the Anglo-German naval arms race? Weinberg accused Ferguson of distorting both German and British history and ignoring any evidence that did not fit with his thesis that Britain should never have fought Germany, stating that The Pity of War was interesting as a historical provocation, but was not persuasive as history.Weinberg, Gerhard Review of The Pity of War pp. 281\u2013282 from Central European History Volume 33, Issue 02, June 2000 p. 282."]}, {"page": "George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd", "response": ["Through the efforts of his friends Samuel Pepys Cockerell, working in the commercial department of the Foreign Office, and Gertrude Bell, whom he had come to know, he started work as an unpaid honorary attach\u00e9 in Constantinople.

He was the third of four sons of Sir William Eden, 7th and 5th Baronet, and Sybil Frances Grey, a member of the prominent Grey family of Northumberland. Sir William was a former colonel and local magistrate from an old titled family. An eccentric and often foul-tempered man, he was a talented watercolourist, portraitist and collector of Impressionists.Aster 1976, p. 2.Rhodes James 1986, pp. 9\u201314. Eden's mother had wanted to marry Francis Knollys, who later became a significant Royal adviser, but the match was forbidden by the Prince of Wales.Rhodes James 1986, p. 10. Although she was a popular figure locally, she had a strained relationship with her children, and her profligacy ruined the family fortunes, meaning Eden's elder brother Tim had to sell Windlestone in 1936.Rhodes James 1986, p. 6.

Rothwell writes that \"mystery persists\" over exactly how Eden was persuaded to resign, although the limited evidence suggests that Butler, who was expected to succeed him as prime minister, was at the centre of the intrigue. Rothwell writes that Eden's fevers were \"nasty but brief and not life-threatening\" and that there may have been \"manipulation of medical evidence\" to make Eden's health seem \"even worse\" than it was. Macmillan wrote in his diary that \"nature had provided a real health reason\" when a \"diplomatic illness\" might otherwise have had to be invented. David Carlton (1981) even suggested that the Palace might have been involved, a suggestion discussed by Rothwell. As early as spring 1954 Eden had been indifferent to cultivating good relations with the new Queen. Eden is known to have favoured a Japanese or Scandinavian style monarchy (i.e. with no involvement in politics whatsoever) and in January 1956 he had insisted that Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin spend only the minimum amount of time in talks with the Queen. Evidence also exists that the Palace was concerned at not being kept fully informed during the Suez Crisis. In the 1960s, Clarissa Eden was observed to speak of the Queen \"in an extremely hostile and belittling way\", and in an interview in 1976, Eden commented that he \"would not claim she was pro-Suez\".Rothwell 1992, pp. 245\u2013246."]}, {"page": "Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War", "response": ["Buchanan cites many historians including George F.

Charmley argued that similar to many of Churchill's contemporaries, he held a hierarchical perspective on race, believing white Protestant Christians to be at the top of this hierarchy, and white Catholics beneath them, while Indians were higher on this hierarchy than Black Africans. Charmley adds the he believes that Churchill saw himself and Britain as being the winners in a social Darwinian hierarchy. However, historian Richard Toye follows on from this by saying that Churchill was not unique in having these views, and that although Churchill may have thought that white people were superior, it did not mean he thought it was therefore correct to treat non-white people in an inhumane way \u2014 he did not.", "John Charmley has argued that Churchill's denigration of Mahatma Gandhi in the early 1930s contributed to fellow British Conservatives' dismissal of his early warnings about the rise of Adolf Hitler. Churchill's comments on Indians \u2013 as well as his views on race as a whole \u2013 were judged by his contemporaries within the Conservative Party to be extreme. Churchill's personal doctor, Lord Moran, commented at one point that, in regards to other races, \"Winston thinks only of the colour of their skin.\"  Alternatively, in 1935, Churchill supported the Indian nationalists and advised them on how to improve the country, saying, \u201cI am genuinely sympathetic towards India. I have got real fears about the future. India, I feel is a burden on us. We have got to maintain an army and for the sake of India we have to maintain Singapore and Near East strength.
