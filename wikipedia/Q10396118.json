There were significant changes to the playing squad ahead of the season, and the records for the highest transfer fees received and paid by Gillingham were both broken.  Shortly after the end of the 1997\u201398 season, Jimmy Corbett, a forward who had debuted in August 1997 at the age of 17, moved to FA Premier League club Blackburn Rovers for an initial fee of \u00a3525,000 (equivalent to \u00a3\u00a0million in ); clauses in the contract meant that the fee had the potential to nearly double if Corbett played more than a specified number of games at the higher level.  A succession of injuries, however, limited his playing time at Blackburn and Gillingham received no further money.  In June, Ade Akinbiyi, the team's top goalscorer in the previous season, joined Bristol City of the First Division for \u00a31.2\u00a0million (equivalent to \u00a3\u00a0million in ), a new record for the highest transfer fee received by the club.

Gillingham also signed John Hodge from Walsall, and Mark Saunders and Paul Williams, both from Plymouth Argyle."]}]}}
