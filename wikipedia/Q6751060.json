His recruitment was successful over the summer, with Blaine Hudson the first arrival from Cambridge United. More followed as Wes York and Louis Moult followed from former club Nuneaton. Others included Manny Smith, Connor Jennings and Dan Bachmann on loan from Stoke City. The season began with a win over Dartford, with Wes York bagging a brace.
