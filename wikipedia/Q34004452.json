Virginia Woolf presented the same opinion through her character Mr. Ramsay in To the Lighthouse, and in her own voice said that in the funeral scene the various elements \"come together\u2026drawn, one knows not how, to make a whole, a complete presentation of life\". The boat-repairing speech put Catherine Macdonald Maclean in mind of David's lament for Absalom in the Second Book of Samuel. John Buchan wrote that Mucklebackit and Edie Ochiltree were the true heroes of The Antiquary, and that through strong emotion the fisherman rose to an epic dignity with the austere quality of the sagas. Scott's biographer Edgar Johnson praised the \"racy and picturesque Scots\" of Mucklebackit's dialogue, and found his rhetoric \"beautiful and effective\", but wondered whether its poetry and eloquence were true to life. David D. Brown thought the interchange between Mucklebackit and Oldbuck the most poignant in all Scott's work, Mucklebackit being Scott's \"only spokesman for the incipient working classes\". Likewise Harry E. Shaw found the boat-repairing scene unforgettable, and saw Mucklebackit as the voice of social protest by the Scottish peasant class against the gentry. Jane Millgate considered the tragedy of Mucklebackit's bereavement an essential strand of the novel's plot, in that it shows us the empathetic and humane side of Oldbuck's character and prepares both Oldbuck and the reader for his generous response to Lord Glenallan's plea for help in recovering his lost son. The scholar Robin Mayhead, noting that Mucklebackit is, with Edie Ochiltree, the character furthest from sham and pretension, was reminded of the stoical Scott who endured the troubled years that followed the death of his wife Charlotte."]}, {"page": "Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border", "response": ["For many later readers, as Andrew Lang wrote, \"Scott composed 'a standard text', now the classical text, of the ballads which he published\".  Comparisons are often made with Percy's Reliques. The Scott scholar Jane Millgate thought the Minstrelsy had a unity and coherence not found there, but A. N. Wilson nevertheless found himself preferring the Reliques: \"[I]n terms of range, [Scott] surpassed Bishop Percy, but not in that nebulous, odd art which can make an anthology a companion for life.  We still keep Percy's Reliques, not Scott's Minstrelsy, on the bedside table.\"  In the 20th century the Minstrelsy had a controversial reputation among academic writers on the folk tradition because of its failure to meet modern standards of scholarship, but they have nevertheless acknowledged the ability of Scott's editorial method to capture something of the essence of the Scottish ballad. Jane Millgate admired \"his ability not only to draw on the skills of very different men and organize the most diverse kinds of material but also to appear, almost simultaneously, in several guises \u2013 as antiquarian, scholar, historian, critic, and poet\". T. F. Henderson called it \"one of the great monuments of Scottish literature\", and the literary historian David Hewitt has called it \"the most exciting collection of ballads ever to appear.\""]}, {"page": "Rose Mary Crawshay Prize", "response": ["|Jane Millgate"]}, {"page": "The Siege of Malta (novel)", "response": ["In 1977, it at last became possible for the reading public to form an accurate idea of the novel's plot and style when Donald E.
