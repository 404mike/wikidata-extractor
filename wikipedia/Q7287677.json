On his retirement he lived for a time in France but returned to London to continue as an active scholar in the field.  In addition to having curated the Panoramania exhibition at the Barbican, he co-authored with Felix Barker the richly illustrated book London As It Might Have Been, which illustrates numerous planned, but never built, fanciful structures in London.  He was a member of the International Panorama Council, and at the time of his death was compiling a Dictionary of Panoramists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Panoramic painting", "response": ["An exhibition \"Panoramania\" was held at the Barbican in the 1980s, with a catalog by Ralph Hyde.
