He also played in the Football League for Wigan Athletic, Stockport County, Oldham Athletic, Plymouth Argyle and Watford before finishing his career with a brief spell in Greece with PAOK Thessaloniki, during a career in which he played in 524 league matches and scored 235 league goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["|1990|| Micky Quinn"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Micky Quinn \u2013 talkSport 2002\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Arsenal Stadium", "response": ["In January 1990, the Taylor report on the Hillsborough disaster was published, which recommended that football stadia become all-seater. The North Bank, which had become home of Arsenal's most passionate supporters, was demolished at the end of the 1991\u201392 season. During redevelopment, a giant mural of fans was placed behind the goal at that end, to give the illusion that the players were kicking towards a crowd rather than a construction site. The mural initially attracted criticism for its absence of black fans, which was quickly rectified. The lengthy process of rebuilding the North Bank meant that Highbury was three-sided for the entire 1992\u201393 season, which was also the first season of the new FA Premier League. Although a lack of goals meant that Arsenal only finished 10th in the new league, they won both of the domestic cup competitions that season. Populous (then LOBB Partnership) designed all-seater two-tier North Bank Stand, the last area of Highbury to be refurbished, which was opened in August 1993 at a cost of \u00a320\u00a0million amid strong opposition from local residents. The new North Bank Stand contained a museum and a concourse with video arcades, bars, confectionery counters, souvenir shops and fast-food stands. While the all-seater North Bank was \"never the same as the old-fashioned Archibald Leitch stand\" that it replaced, it was \"much more like the future of Arsenal than the past\" with its added amenities and \"Gone were the days of pushing a petrified child through a packed crowd and placing them on a barrier from which they could only see a small section of the pitch\". The old stand had received a fitting send off with a 5\u20131 defeat of Southampton, though the new stand had a less auspicious start, the first game being a surprise 0\u20133 defeat to Coventry City with all three goals coming from striker Micky Quinn. The first victory came 10 days later against Leeds United."]}, {"page": "Who Ate All the Pies?", "response": ["The chant has been associated with the striker Micky Quinn, who played for six football clubs in the 1980s and 1990s. He was particularly identified with the chant following an incident in a match between Quinn's then club Newcastle United and Grimsby Town in March 1992, in which a fan threw a pie onto the pitch which Quinn promptly picked up and ate. The chant even formed the title for Quinn's autobiography, which was published in 2003."]}, {"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  Micky Quinn 17"]}, {"page": "Talksport", "response": ["* June 2006: the station broadcast the 2006 World Cup, with live match commentary of all 64 matches in Germany.
