He also made 33 appearances in league games for Newcastle (7 goals) in season 1963-64 and 34 appearances in league games for Crystal Palace (8 goals), in season 1968\u201369, in which he helped Palace achieve promotion to the top flight for the first time. His haul of 32 goals for Walsall in season 1959\u201360 remains a record from the left wing.\nTaylor was a flame-haired, barrel-chested left-winger who was a member of Walsall's first team during their golden days of the 1950s and 1960s. Taylor was best known for his powerful shooting skills and the accuracy of his left foot and as a result of this, he was nick-named \"Cannonball Colin\" by Walsall`s fans. Such was the power in his left boot, Walsall fans of his era would claim that \"his left leg was out of proportion to his right\". Supporters would also eulogise that, when he shot at the \"Railway End\" goal at Fellow's Park, and happened to miss, the speed of the ball would be such, as to knock the rust off an old tea-sales caravan, permanently parked at that end.\nOn his retirement from professional football, Taylor, a quiet, modest man, worked as a painter and decorator.\nFollowing his death in 2005, Walsall F.C. promised to build a permanent memorial for Taylor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walsall F.C.", "response": ["1970\u201371 saw the first league meeting between Walsall and their very first opponents Aston Villa.
