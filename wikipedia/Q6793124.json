The legislation allowed requests for information to be refused if the cost they would incur exceeded \u00a3600 for Whitehall and \u00a3450 for other public bodies. Falconer proposed changes that would make no difference to this level, but would expand the number of activities whose cost would be included in the totals, thus making it easier for government parties to refuse requests for information. At the end of March 2007, Falconer's department announced that it would not introduce the proposals to parliament, but would instead have a second three-month consultation with the public (the previous consultation, also of three months, ended three weeks previous to this). Media elements reported this change as a 'backtracking', and Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, was quoted as saying \"This raises the strong possibility that the government will decide to leave the current arrangements untouched\"."]}, {"page": "Campaign for Freedom of Information", "response": ["The Campaign is a not-for-profit company, unaffiliated to any political party, (registration number 1781526) governed by a board of non-executive directors.
