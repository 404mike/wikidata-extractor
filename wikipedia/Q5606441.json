(Enjoy What You Do)\" (1982) and Malcolm McLaren's \"Buffalo Gals\" (1982). More serious British artists were rapping live or recording amateur tapes in the early 1980s, but the first British hip hop tune released on record was \"London Bridge\" by Newtrament in 1984. Over the next few years, more UK hip hop and electro was released: Street Sounds Electro UK (1984), which was produced by Greg Wilson and featured an early appearance from MC Kermit, who later went on to form the Wilson produced Ruthless Rap Assassins; The Rapologists' \"Kids Rap/Party Rap\" (1984), but releases and national publicity were still rare. Mainstream radio did play British hip hop on occasion, and instrumental in giving the scene wider recognition were DJs such as Dave Pearce, Tim Westwood, and John Peel, but in this period it made very little impact on the mainstream charts. The scene remained predominantly underground depending on word of mouth and the patronage of pirate radio stations. The first UK record label devoted to releasing UK hip hop acts was Simon Harris' Music of Life label, founded in 1986. It was home to Derek B, the first UK rapper to achieve chart success. Music of Life went on to sign groups such as Hijack, the Demon Boyz, Hardnoise (later Son of Noise) and MC Duke. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2013 for example Massive Attack with trip hop, or Galliano with acid jazz. Hip Hop Connection, the first major British hip hop magazine, was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London \u2013  such as Blade, Black Radical Mk II and Overlord X \u2013 but many distinct scenes developed nationally."]}, {"page": "The Big Chill (music festival)", "response": ["2009 Eastnor Castle: Basement Jaxx, Orbital, David Byrne, Lamb, Spiritualized, Pharoah Sanders, Amadou & Mariam, Max Romeo, Mulatu Astatke, Chris Cunningham, Josie Long, Tim Minchin, Dylan Moran, Noel Fielding, Russell Howard, Metro Area, Michael Lang, Friendly Fires, Mr Hudson, Chrome Hoof, Calexico, Ashley Beedle, The Field, James Yuill, Todd Terje, Bass Clef, Tomb Crew, Don Letts, Laura B, Bonobo, Justin Robertson, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, To Rococo Rot, David Shrigley, Norman Jay, Gong, John Cooper Clarke, Mixmaster Morris, Congo Natty, Jazzie B, Keb Darge, Adrian Sherwood, Greg Wilson, DJ Derek, Sparky, Suns of Arqa, Dominic Glynn.", "2010 Eastnor Castle: Massive Attack, M.I.A., Lily Allen, Thom Yorke, Roots Manuva, Gregory Isaacs, Explosions In The Sky, Plan B, Tinie Tempah, Bebel Gilberto, Kelis, Roy Ayers, Mike Patton's Mondo Cane, Kruder & Dorfmeister, Layo & Bushwacka!, Magnetic Man, Mr. Scruff, Craig Charles, Mystery Jets, Steve Mason, Chris Coco, Benji B, Liars, Caribou, Mount Kimbie, The Leisure Society, Rye Rye, Riva Starr, Bonobo, Villagers, Henrik Schwarz, Andy Weatherall, Hospital Records, Little Dragon, The Bug, Mad Professor, Joker, Appleblim, Theo Parrish, Greg Wilson, DJ Derek, Tom Middleton, Futureboogie, Alice Russell, The Heavy, Andreya Triana, Funki Porcini, Lol Hammond, Willkommen Collective, Dry The River, Beth Jeans Houghton, Sparky, Dominic Glynn."]}, {"page": "British hip hop", "response": ["Over the next few years, more UK hip hop and electro music was released: Street Sounds Electro UK (Street Sounds, 1984), which was produced by Greg Wilson and featured an early appearance from MC Kermit, who later went on to form the Wilson produced Ruthless Rap Assassins; The Rapologists' \"Kids Rap/Party Rap\" (Billy Boy, 1984) and Grandmaster Richie Rich's \"Don't Be Flash\" (Spin Offs, 1985).
