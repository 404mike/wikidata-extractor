In 1999 he and two other UKIP candidates were elected to the European Parliament. The following year, he stepped down from the leadership as a result of calling for extended powers for the European Parliament in his maiden speech there in defiance of party policy.

The Guardian newspaper described him in 2001 as \"an emollient man, a sort of Willie Whitelaw figure, and an ideal leader for such a fractious party\". He led UKIP into the 2001 general election, in which it stood more than 420 candidates but failed to make any breakthroughs (although it did consolidate its position as the largest of the smaller parties). Titford stepped down as party leader in October 2002, in order to allow his successor time to plan his strategy for the 2004 European elections. He also wanted to spend more time on political campaigns in the East of England, where he continued to be an active MEP.
