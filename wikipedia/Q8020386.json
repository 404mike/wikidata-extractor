The explosion loosened the gun covers and Seaman Williams, with great presence of mind, took the whole weight on himself and physically prevented the covers from falling and betraying the ship to the enemy.The Pargust's 'panic party', the decoy crew carried on every Q ship for the purpose of leaving it apparently abandoned when attacked, took to the lifeboats and the U-boat then surfaced, believing the Pargust to be a crewless and defenceless merchant vessel. When the U-boat was about 50 yards (46 m) away, the captain of  HMS Pargust gave the order to fire and the submarine was blown up and sank.\nIn the case of a gallant and daring act in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross a secret ballot is drawn. The crew of  HMS Pargust selected William Williams to be the recipient of the award due to a rating in the action.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Williams", "response": ["William Williams may refer to:", "* William Williams (artist) (1727\u20131791), artist and author of American novel Penrose", "* William Williams (antiquary) (Gwilym Ddu o Arfon, 1739\u20131817), Welsh historian and poet", "* William Williams (Carw Coch) (1808\u20131872, bardic name Carw Coch), Welsh literary figure", "* William Williams (Creuddynfab) (1814\u20131869), Welsh poet and literary critic", "* William Williams (Crwys) (1875\u20131968, bardic name Crwys), Welsh-language poet", "* William Williams (soldier) (died 1814), soldier killed in defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812", "* William Williams (Medal of Honor) (1840\u20131893), Medal of Honor recipient of the American Civil War", "* William Williams (VC) (1890\u20131965), Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War", "* William Williams (Connecticut politician) (1731\u20131811), US Continental Congressman", "* William Williams (New York politician) (1815\u20131876), US Representative from New York", "* William Williams (Indiana politician) (1821\u20131896), US Representative from Indiana", "* William Williams (surgeon) (1856\u20131919), Surgeon General", "* William Williams (commissioner) (1862\u20131947), Commissioner of Immigration, Ellis Island", "* Sir William Williams, 6th Baronet (died 1696), Welsh politician", "* Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn (1634\u20131700), Welsh lawyer and politician, speaker of the House of Commons", "* Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Gray's Inn (1665\u20131740), Welsh politician, Member of Parliament (MP) for Denbigh, 1708\u20131710", "* Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Clapton (1730\u20131761), MP for New Shoreham, 1758\u20131751", "* William Williams (Radical politician) (1788\u20131865), Welsh businessman based in London, Radical MP 1835\u20131847 and 1850\u20131865", "* William Williams (Swansea MP) (1840\u20131904), British Member of Parliament for Swansea District 1893\u20131895", "* William Williams (Labour politician) (1895\u20131963), British civil servant and politician", "* William Williams (New South Wales politician) (1856\u20131947), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* William Williams (Tasmanian politician) (1851\u20131924), member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council", "* William Williams (Archdeacon of Cashel) (fl. 17th century), Irish Anglican clergyman", "* William Williams of Wern (1781\u20131840), Welsh Independent minister, promoter of the General Union movement of 1834", "* William Williams (bishop) (1800\u20131878), bishop of Waiapu in New Zealand", "* William Williams (Caledfryn) (1801\u20131869), Welsh Congregational minister, poet and literary critic", "* William Williams (priest) (1848\u20131930), Dean of St David's, 1919\u20131931", "* William Williams (minister) (1848\u20131913), Australian Methodist minister and president-general of the Methodist Church of Australasia 1907\u20131910", "* William Williams (missionary) (1859\u20131892), Welsh missionary to East Khasi Hills, India", "* William Williams (footballer) (1856\u2013?), Welsh international footballer in the 1870s and 1880s", "* William Williams (footballer, born 1892) (1892\u20131926), English footballer", "* William Williams (rugby union) (1866\u20131945), Welsh rugby union footballer in the 1880s and 1890s", "* William Williams (Halifax RLFC) (20th century), Welsh rugby league footballer in the 1900s and 1910s", "* J.

The Admiralty decided that Pargust's action was worthy of the VC but that all of the crew had acted with equal valour, so article 13 of the VC's royal warrant was applied and the ship's company voted for one commissioned officer and one petty officer or seaman to receive the award: these were Pargust first lieutenant, Ronald Stuart, and seaman William Williams.

After some time ashore all three returned to sea in a vessel they had personally chosen, an old, battered tramp steamer named SS Vittoria. Renaming it , they armed their vessel with a  gun, two twelve pounders, two machine guns, torpedo tubes and depth charges.p. 126, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling Thus armed the Pargust departed on her first patrol to the same grounds where U-83 had been sunk, in the waters south of Ireland. For the first few days her duties consisted only of rescuing survivors from sunken cargo ships but with increasing German activity, an attack was expected at any moment. On 7 June 1917, Pargust was suddenly struck by a torpedo fired at very close range from an unseen German submarine.p. 304, Symbol of Courage, Max Arthur Unlike the Farnborough action, the damage done to the Pargust was immense. The ship was holed close to the waterline, and its cover was almost blown when one of the twelve pounder gun ports was blasted free from its mounting; it was only the quick thinking of sailor William Williams, who took the full weight of the gun port on himself, that prevented the gun being exposed. One petty officer was killed and a number wounded.p. 127, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling", "The wrecked Pargust was taken in tow by HMS Crocus,  and HMS Zinnia and reached Queenstown barely afloat nearly two days later. The port's admiral congratulated the crew personally on their arrival. As before, the crew were awarded \u00a31,000 prize money and several awards were promised. Unusually, the Admiralty were unable to decide who among the ship's crew should receive the Victoria Cross as all were deemed to have participated in the action with equal valour. It was thus decided for the first time, under article 13 of the Victoria Cross's royal warrant, that one officer and one enlisted man would be granted the award following a ballot by the ship's company.p. 129, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling After the vote, from which Campbell abstained, the Victoria Crosses were awarded to Stuart and William Williams. Fourteen other crew members were awarded medals, including DSOs for Campbell and Hereford.
