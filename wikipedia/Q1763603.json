The F Section of the SOE was headed by Maurice Buckmaster and provided invaluable support for the resistance. From May 1941, Frenay founded Combat, one of the first Resistance groups. Frenay recruited for Combat by asking people such questions as whether they believed that Britain would not be defeated and if they thought a German victory was worth stopping, and based on the answers he received would ask those whom he thought were inclined to resistance: \"Men are already gathering in the shadows. Will you join them?\". Frenay, who was to emerge as one of the leading resistance chefs, later wrote: \"I myself never attacked a den of collaborators or derailed trains. I never killed a German or a Gestapo agent with my own hand\". For security reasons, Combat was divided into a series of cells that were unaware of each other. Another early resistance group founded in the summer of 1940 was the ill-fated Interalli\u00e9 group led by a Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 Roman Czerniawski that passed on intelligence from contacts in the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau to Britain via couriers from Marseilles.

These checks were spelling mistakes or phrases deliberately inserted into a message by a wireless operator to prove that it was indeed he or she who was transmitting.
