His paintings explore themes such as the cycle of life and creativity. These artworks can be monumental and three-dimensional, such as a painting in which visitors walk from room to room on the ground floor of the \"Villa La Californie (Damian Elwes)\" (2006\u20132018), to witness the extent of Pablo Picasso's creativity in April, 1956 or an immense landscape painting on the ground, Amazon (1999), on which visitors can walk above the exotic, flowering plants of a cloud forest and search for the source of the river.\nIn 2018, the Mus\u00e9e en Herbe in Paris hosted \"Secrets of the Studio, from Claude Monet to Ai Weiwei,\" a retrospective of Elwes' Artist Studio paintings. These paintings transport viewers directly into the worlds of creative geniuses from the 19th century to the present. More than one hundred thousand people attended his immersive and interactive exhibition. Visitors could walk through Picasso's Villa in Cannes or roam around in a VR painting of Brancusi's original Montparnasse workshop.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cary Elwes", "response": ["Born Ivan Simon Cary Elwes on 26 October 1962 in Westminster, London, he is the youngest of three sons of portrait painter Dominic Elwes and interior designer and socialite Tessa Kennedy.
