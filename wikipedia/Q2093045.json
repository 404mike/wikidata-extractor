He leads a trio and quartet and is co-founder of the Monk Liberation Band. His trio includes drummer Winston Clifford and Hammond B3 organist Anders Olinder. Kofi is signed to the Specific Jazz label. He has twice won BBC Jazz Awards: Best Instrumentalist in 2008 and Best Album in 2005 for All Is Know. Tony joined Grand Union Orchestra in 1998, led by artistic director Tony Haynes, and has been a prominent player ever since. In May 2021 Kofi appeared on BBC Radio 4 to discuss his early life and the life-changing event that led him to take up the saxophone.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Saxophone Quartet", "response": ["The original members were Julius Hemphill (alto and soprano saxophone, flute), Oliver Lake (alto and soprano saxophone), Hamiet Bluiett (baritone saxophone, alto clarinet), and David Murray (tenor saxophone, bass clarinet). The first three had worked together as members of the Black Artists' Group in St. Louis, Missouri.  In 1991, Hemphill left the group due to illness, and was replaced by Arthur Blythe, although several saxophonists have filled his chair in the years since.  Hemphill died on April 2, 1995. In the late 1980s, the quartet used Bluiett's composition \"Hattie Wall\" (released on W.S.Q., Live in Zurich, Dances and Ballads, Steppenwolf and Yes We Can) as a signature theme for the group.  The group principally recorded and performed as a saxophone quartet, usually with a line-up of two altos, tenor, and baritone (reflecting the composition of a classical string quartet), but were also joined later in their career by drummers, bassists, and other musicians. Occasionally other saxophonists would sit in or substitute for a tour. These guests have included Sam Rivers, Tony Kofi, Steve Potts, Branford Marsalis, James Spaulding and Jorge Sylvester. Hamiet Bluiett died on October 4, 2018, after an extended illness. The ensemble had split up in 2016."]}, {"page": "Julian Joseph", "response": ["Joseph founded the Julian Joseph Jazz Academy in January 2013 in London.Education, Julian Joseph.
