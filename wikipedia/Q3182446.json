He was also the leader of a Christian sect, and the founder of the Abbey Folk Park, the earliest example of a folk park in Britain.\nHe was born in what is now Belize. In 1908 he graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in history, following in the footsteps of his father, Herbert Ward, who also had studied history before entering the priesthood of the Anglican Church.\nJohn Ward became a prolific and sometimes controversial writer on a wide variety of topics. He made contributions to the history of Freemasonry and other secret societies. He was also a psychic medium or spiritualist, a prominent churchman and is still seen by some as a mystic and modern-day prophet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Barnet", "response": ["*John Sebastian Marlowe Ward who founded a folk museum in Park Road."]}, {"page": "John Ward", "response": ["*John Sebastian Marlowe Ward (1885\u20131949), British historian, Freemason and spiritualist"]}, {"page": "Abbey Arts Centre", "response": ["Around 1930, John Sebastian Marlowe Ward became the owner of the site which a 1930 plan indicates was no longer divided into two houses. In that year, he purchased a circa 13th century tithe barn (grade II listed) and relocated it to the site from Birchington in Kent. He subsequently converted it to a church and founded a religious community. In 1934 he opened the Abbey Folk Park which by 1937 comprised 46 buildings, included historic shop fronts and a 17th-century smithy saved when East Barnet village was redeveloped and five old cottages relocated from Hadley Green. The park closed in 1940 and did not reopen before Ward sold it and moved his community to Cyprus in 1946 following legal difficulties in England."]}, {"page": "JSM Ward", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Sebastian Marlowe Ward"]}, {"page": "J.
