They even played a gig there, at the Greyhound music club, and amongst those who attended were members of the band Der Zibet, who were also recording in London at the time. The members of Buck-Tick loved London, especially Sakurai, who felt that the music scene there was more welcoming of dark and serious music.Words by Buck-Tick, Shinko Music Publishing Company, Ltd. 2002.  . English translation of 1994 interview with Atsushi Sakurai and Issay available here  Indeed, with Taboo, the band broke into a darker, more serious sound which took a fair amount of criticism from members of the Japanese music scene who had previously thought of Buck-Tick as little more than idols.

Two weeks after Pebble Mill at One began, ITV launched a brand new daytime line-up, including an ITN News bulletin at lunchtime, placing it in direct competition with Pebble Mill at One. One of the more frequently repeated scenes from Pebble Mill at One was in 1986, when Marian Foster introduced pop singer Owen Paul, who was to perform his hit cover of Marshall Crenshaw's \"My Favourite Waste of Time\". He was expected to mime to a backing track, but as he could not hear the foldback loudspeaker as it had failed, Paul was left standing looking into the camera, while viewers heard him singing to the music."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Owen Paul, singer"]}, {"page": "Taboo (Buck-Tick album)", "response": ["* Owen Paul - producer"]}, {"page": "List of bands from Glasgow", "response": ["*Owen Paul"]}, {"page": "Hits 5", "response": ["#Owen Paul - \"My Favourite Waste of Time\"\u2020\u2020"]}, {"page": "List of Epic Records artists", "response": ["* Owen Paul"]}, {"page": "You're My Favorite Waste of Time", "response": ["Written by Crenshaw while in Beatlemania, the song was inspired by the Hollies and featured tongue-in-cheek lyrics about his wife.
