He also pioneered stereography. By 1835, he controlled his father's instrument making business in Liverpool. He was responsible for various inventions, but did not patent many of his ideas. In 1856, he invented the stereoscopic camera (GB patent 2064/1856). He died at the age of 75 and was buried at Brooklands Cemetery, Sale, Greater Manchester.\nDancer improved the Daniell cell by introducing the porous pot cell, which he invented in 1838. He was a leading inventor and practitioner in the emerging field of microphotography, work he began shortly after the Daguerreotype process was first announced in 1839.  His novel uses of microphotography, such as \"the reduction of the 680-word tablet erected in memory of the electrician William Sturgeon to a positive one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter\", attracted much public attention. Dancer was remembered as a person very willing to share his expertise with others.  For example, he assisted the physicist James Prescott Joule with the development of scientific instruments such as an apparatus for measuring the internal capacity of the bore of thermometer tubes, a tangent galvanometer, and other devices useful in Joule's research. A substantial collection of Dancer's papers, photographs, and apparatus is held by the Ransom Center at the University of Texas.\n\nIn 1842 Dancer took a daguerreotype from the top of the Royal Exchange which is the earliest known photograph showing part of Manchester.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North West England", "response": ["Parsonage Colliery at Leigh had the UK's deepest mine\u20141,260 metres in 1949.

He claimed to be able to measure temperatures to within  of a degree Fahrenheit (3\u00a0mK). Such precision was certainly uncommon in contemporary experimental physics but his doubters may have neglected his experience in the art of brewing and his access to its practical technologies. He was also ably supported by scientific instrument-maker John Benjamin Dancer. Joule's experiments complemented the theoretical work of Rudolf Clausius, who is considered by some to be the coinventor of the energy concept."]}, {"page": "V-mail", "response": ["The U.S. military's V-mail was based on British Airgraphs, which were based on Eastman Kodak's patent obtained from New York City banker George McCarthy.

This resulted in a microphotograph about  in area. The main disadvantage of Dancer's method was that the viewing of the microphotographs required a microscope which was at the time an expensive instrument. In 1857 Dagron solved the problem by inventing a method of mounting the microphotographs at the end of a small cylindrical lens.A history and handbook of photography (1877) Author: Tissandier, Gaston, 1843-1899 Subject: Photography; Photography Publisher: New York : Scoville Manufacturing Quote: \"It is a miniature microscope with considerable magnifying powers. The image seen through it is magnified about three hundred times.\" and \"The lens used for toy micropliotographs resembles the Stanhope lens, but is not cut down in the centre to form a diaphragm. It consists simply of a cylinder of flint glass, or long plano-convex lens whose focus is its ovm plain surface, to which the photograph is attached with Canada balsam.\" Dagron modified the Stanhope lens by sectioning the normally biconvex Stanhope lens and introducing a planar section so that the plane was located at the focal length of the convex side of the cylindrical lens. This produced a plano-convex lens, where Dagron was able to mount the microscopic photograph on the flat side of the lens using Canada balsam as adhesive. This arrangement enabled the picture to be focused."]}, {"page": "Microphotograph", "response": ["Using the daguerreotype process, John Benjamin Dancer was one of the first to produce microphotographs, in 1839."]}, {"page": "John Dancer", "response": ["#redirect John Benjamin Dancer"]}, {"page": "Carpenter and Westley", "response": ["The company was founded in 1808 when Carpenter opened his first workshop on Inge Street in Birmingham.
