He spent a period on loan to Arsenal's nursery club Margate, but never played a first-team game for Arsenal themselves, with opportunities limited by the presence of England captain Eddie Hapgood. Walker joined West Ham United in 1936, and went on to make 118 league and cup appearances for the east London club.After the outbreak of World War II, Walker's three Second Division appearances of 1939\u201340 were expunged from the records. He played in all but one of the Football League War Cup games of that season, leading to victory at Wembley in June 1940. He also played in 27 matches of the Football League South, which ended with West Ham finishing second in both A and C groups. The following season, he made nine League South appearances, and 1941\u201342 saw him make two appearances each in the League South and the London War Cup. Walker also played for St Mirren during the war, making nine appearances in the Southern League during the 1942\u201343 season. He saw service with the Royal Air Force and toured the Far East.Walker played in 21 games of the first peacetime League South season of 1945\u201346, which included pre-war First and Second Division clubs. His last game for West Ham was a 3\u20133 away draw against Wolves that season.After this, Walker rejoined Margate as player-manager for two seasons (winning the Kent League). He then moved to Ashford Town (Kent), where he performed a similar role for the following three seasons (winning the Kent League in his first season). He later managed Ramsgate in a part-time capacity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margate F.C.", "response": ["After the Second World War, the Gate continued to play in the Kent League under new manager Charlie Walker, who led the team to two Kent League championships but was then controversially sacked. The team slumped during a succession of rapid managerial changes which only ended in 1950 when Almer Hall was appointed manager, a post he was to hold for the next twenty years. Under Hall, the team won a host of local cup honours and reached the rounds proper of the FA Cup on a number of occasions, but never managed to match this success in league competition."]}, {"page": "Ashford United F.C.", "response": ["After the war the club re-formed in 1946 and with Joe Fagg as team manager and former West Ham United defender Charlie Walker as player-coach were Kent League champions in 1948\u201349. This success was by 'goal average' as three clubs (Ashford, Dover and Ramsgate) all finished the campaign with 52 points from 34 matches. In recognition of the achievement the club presented an engraved fountain pen to each player. The team scored 109 goals in their league campaign (second highest ever to the 115 scored in the 1931\u201332 season). It was almost a double celebration as the reserve side missed out on top spot in the Kent League Division 2 with Folkestone's reserves taking the honours. The Ashford second string were however subsequently successful, taking the Kent League Division 2 title in the 1952\u201353 and 1955\u201356 campaigns."]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. players", "response": ["| Charlie Walker"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 in English football", "response": ["* 7 May 1990 - Charlie Walker, 78, played 118 games as full-back for West Ham United during a career which was interrupted by World War II."]}, {"page": "Charles Walker", "response": ["Charles or Charlie Walker may refer to:", "* Charlie Walker (Australian cricketer) (Charles William Walker, 1909\u20131942), Australian wicket-keeper", "* Charlie Walker (English cricketer) (born 1992), English cricketer, plays for Oxford MCCU and for Herefordshire", "* Charlie Walker (footballer, born 1911) (1911\u20131990), English football player", "* Charlie Walker (footballer, born 1990), English football player for Aldershot Town", "* Charlie Walker (rugby union) (born 1992), English rugby player with Harlequin F.C.", "* Charlie Walker (musician) (1926\u20132008), American country musician"]}, {"page": "List of Margate F.C. managers", "response": ["Although Margate F.C. was founded in 1896, a full-time manager was not appointed until 1929, when Arthur Graves was appointed upon the club's reformation after a year's hiatus.
