There he acquired a good command of Chinese, Dutch and Malay. In October 1840, he was appointed Chinese secretary to the British superintendent of trade in China. He was sent along with other to inspect the newly-acquired colony of British Hong Kong in early 1841. During the Opium War, he worked under Rear-Admiral George Elliot and Sir Henry Pottinger.\nIn the following years, he held a number of important consular positions in Chinese treaty ports such as Fuzhou, Shanghai (as H.M. Consul), Hangzhou and Hankou. Medhurst distinguished himself as a prominent advocate of gunboat diplomacy to defend what he considered to be British interests in China.\nMedhurst married three times, his third wife being Juliana Tryphena Burningham (1836-1881) whose son Walter Nowell Medhurst died of poisoning on Guernsey in 1880, at 17 years of age.In 1868, Rutherford Alcock sent him to resolve the Yangzhou riot. He was criticized in Britain for his efforts.\nMedhurst retired from consular service on 1 January 1877 and was knighted on 20 March the same year.:\u200a369\u200a In 1881, he took part in founding the British North Borneo Company and subsequently organized coolie trade to Borneo on behalf of the company, having moved back to Hong Kong in 1882, residing there for 18 months.He moved back to England in 1884, and died at Torquay on 26 December 1885, leaving another son and at least two daughters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North Borneo", "response": ["With the beginning of well-planned economic activities under British administration, the North Borneo authorities began to open land for agriculture, and native land rights began to be formed. The government however felt that the native population was too small and unsuited to meet the requirements of modern development, so they began to sponsor various schemes for the migration of Chinese workers from Hong Kong and China. In 1882, the North Borneo authorities appointed Walter Henry Medhurst as Commissioner for Chinese Immigration in the mission to attract more businessmen to invest in North Borneo by providing a workforce. Medhurst's efforts were costly and unsuccessful; however, the Hakka, not part of the plan, began to migrate to North Borneo where they formed an agricultural community."]}, {"page": "Walter Henry Medhurst", "response": ["Walter Henry Medhurst (29 April 179624 January 1857), was an English Congregationalist missionary to China, born in London and educated at St Paul's School.

The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British China Inland Mission in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by Hudson Taylor. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in Shanghai, Sir Walter Henry Medhurst took seventy Royal Marines in a man-of-war and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from Viceroy Zeng Guofan and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries."]}, {"page": "Yangzhou riot", "response": ["As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in Shanghai, Sir Walter Henry Medhurst took seventy Royal marines in a man-of-war and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from the Chinese government under Viceroy Zeng Guofan and financial restitution was offered to the C.I.M. but not accepted, to create goodwill among the Chinese.
