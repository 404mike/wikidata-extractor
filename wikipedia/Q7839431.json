He finished the 1998 season, with promising bowling average of 23, and performed even better the following year, with an average of only 21.\nHowever, he suffered a bone spur injury soon after he hit peak form, and despite his average declining dramatically, he made his only career half-century in the 2000 season. With good control of line and length, it was a surprise that Derbyshire released him the following year.  He was a left-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler.He most recently appeared for Suffolk in the 2005 Minor Counties Championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trevor Smith", "response": ["Trevor Smith may refer to:", "*Trevor Smith (cricketer) (born 1977), English cricketer", "*Trevor Smith (equestrian) (born 1959), Irish Olympic equestrian", "*Trevor Smith (field hockey) (born 1949), Australian Olympic field hockey player", "*Trevor Smith (fighter) (born 1981), American mixed martial artist", "*Trevor Smith (footballer, born 1910) (1910\u20131997), Charlton Athletic, Fulham, Crystal Palace and Watford footballer", "*Trevor Smith (footballer, born 1936) (1936\u20132003), Birmingham City and England footballer", "*Trevor Smith (footballer, born 1965), Scottish footballer ", "*Trevor Smith (ice hockey) (born 1985), Canadian ice hockey player", "*Trevor Smith (actor) (born 1970), Canadian actor and media personality", "*Trevor Smith (EastEnders), minor character in TV soap opera EastEnders", "*Trevor Smith, Baron Smith of Clifton (1937\u20132021), British Liberal Democrat politician"]}]}}
