Maynard took inspiration from Bottom, a comic character from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Froggitt has an urge to improve his life and that of everyone around him; he carries The Times and often tells people \"there was an article about it in The Times\" regarding subjects he has brought up. Maynard considered this an important part of the character, explaining \"I wanted him to be intelligent, always anxious to improve himself. The easy route would've been to use old cliches, like Malapropisms and Spoonerisms, but that would have made the character too one-dimensional. By getting him to read The Times and be an ardent student of dynamic word power, we gave him the breadth to spread the comedy over a wide range of subjects. We wanted people to laugh with him, not at him\".", "Between the second and third series, Bill Maynard suffered a slipped disc and used a wheelchair.
