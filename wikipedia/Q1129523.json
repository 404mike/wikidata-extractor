Henri Bergson, with his L'\u00e9volution cr\u00e9atrice  (1907), was one of the first to propose evolution is \"creative\" and cannot necessarily be explained solely by Darwinian natural selection. L'\u00e9volution cr\u00e9atrice is upheld, according to Bergson, by a constant vital force which animates life and fundamentally connects mind and body, an idea opposing the dualism of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. In 1923, C. Lloyd Morgan took this work further, elaborating on an \"emergent evolution\" which could explain increasing complexity (including the evolution of mind). Morgan found many of the most interesting changes in living things have been largely discontinuous with past evolution. Therefore, these living things did not necessarily evolve through a gradual process of natural selection. Rather, he posited, the process of evolution experiences jumps in complexity (such as the emergence of a self-reflective universe, or noosphere), in a sort of qualitative punctuated equilibrium. Finally, the complexification of human cultures, particularly language, facilitated a quickening of evolution in which cultural evolution occurs more rapidly than biological evolution. Recent understanding of human ecosystems and of human impact on the biosphere have led to a link between the notion of sustainability with the \"co-evolution\" and harmonization of cultural and biological evolution."]}, {"page": "List of psychologists", "response": ["* C.

An example is a skillful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behavior.
