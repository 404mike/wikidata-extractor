Seeking to keep British fascism alive, Hamm organized a series of meetings in Hyde Park from November 1944 onwards and later moved them to the traditional BUF areas of East London. Hamm's League rallies eventually began to attract thousands, which convinced him that a proper political return was a distinct possibility. Hamm's rallies also attracted significant opposition, with clashes between his supporters and antifascists. However, the group's first public campaign actually took place in the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead, where, with Hamm having become associated with Eleonora Tennant, it helped to organise a petition to keep immigrants out of new houses, ostensibly on the pretext that the housing should be kept for returning soldiers. As a result of his involvement, Hamm secured publicity for the League. It also gave him access to leading figures such as Ernest Benn and Waldron Smithers, who had been involved in the initial drawing up of the petition."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Waldron Smithers"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Waldron Smithers"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Waldron Smithers (1880\u20131954), MP for Chislehurst (1924\u20131945) and Orpington (1945\u20131954)"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Waldron Smithers"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Waldron Smithers"]}, {"page": "Chislehurst (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1924 || Sir Waldron Smithers ||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Alfred Smithers", "response": ["Sir Alfred Waldron Smithers (4 October 1850 \u2013 22 August 1924);  ;   was a British businessman and politician, and a pioneer of the railway industry in England and Canada."]}, {"page": "Wellesley Tudor Pole", "response": ["*  and co-wrote The spiritual front, an issue each one of us must face fairly and squarely with Waldron Smithers.

The petition gained some press support and had the backing of Conservative MPs Charles Challen and Waldron Smithers as well as Ernest Benn and the Society for Individual Freedom. Tennant attempted to link Hamm in with this burgeoning movement and the pair held a meeting in Belsize Park on 21 November 1945 in an attempt to link Hamm with them.

Boyd and four of Hampstead's Conservative councillors, with the rest of the Conservative members of the council in favour of the petition.
