In 1929, King Aleksandar proclaimed a dictatorship and imposed a new constitution which, among other things, renamed the country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The territory of Croatia was largely divided into the territories of the Sava and Littoral Banates. Political parties were banned from the start and the royal dictatorship took on an increasingly harsh character. Vladko Ma\u010dek, who had succeeded Radi\u0107 as leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, the largest political party in Croatia, was imprisoned, and members of a newly emerging insurgent movement, the Usta\u0161e, went into exile. According to the British historian Misha Glenny the murder in March 1929 of Toni Schlegel, editor of a pro-Yugoslavian newspaper Novosti, brought a \"furious response\" from the regime. In Lika and west Herzegovina in particular, which he described as \"hotbeds of Croatian separatism,\" he wrote that the majority-Serb police acted \"with no restraining authority whatsoever.\"Misha Glenny, The Balkans 1804\u20131999, Granta Books, London 1345, pp. 431\u2013432"]}, {"page": "Thessaloniki", "response": ["World War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population.

Zukorli\u0107 alleged that Kara\u0111or\u0111e and his followers had indiscriminately targeted the town's residents in 1809, a notion disputed by Serbian historians.

He claimed that Malcolm was \"partisan\" and complained that the book made a \"transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false\". Malcolm responded in the same journal in early 2000, asserting that the book challenged both Albanian and Serbian myths about Kosovo, but that there were more Serbian myths about Kosovo than Albanian ones and this explained the greater coverage of Serbian myths in the book. He also observed that Emmert's perspective and work were largely within the framework of Serbian historiography, and that that was the reason for Emmert's assertion that Malcolm was \"partisan\". Emmert also criticized Malcolm's opposition to the Serbian claim to Kosovo as the \u201ccradle of civilization\u201d, stating that Kosovo did become the center of medieval Serbia and that such feelings among modern Serbs should not be disputed. He also noted the absence of Serbian archives. Likewise, Tim Judah and Misha Glenny criticized Malcolm for not using Serbian sources in the book. He responded that there were no proper Serbian archives for that period of history, but also noted that he had studied a large number of works by Serbian and Montenegrin authors."]}]}}
