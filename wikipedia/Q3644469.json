Jacks had enormous upper body strength and quickly came to dominate the gym tests, setting records in squat thrusts and, in particular, the parallel bar dips. In the 1979 UK national final Jacks comprehensively beat the field, and then went on to compete in Rotterdam for the European title.", "Against Jacks in 1980 was Daley Thompson, globally recognised as the top multi-sports athlete after his victory in the 1980 Olympic Games decathlon competition. With Brian Budd in attendance for the UK National final, Brian Jacks took on Thompson, Steve Assinder from Basketball, pentathlete Danny Nightingale and the new \"Past Master\", former 400m hurdler John Sherwood, who won all his events in the heats, setting a new record.", "To start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off \"Challenge of the Champions\" programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two \"Past Masters\" and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.", "By now a professional Superstar (he won $37000 for the 1982 World Championship), Brian Hooper dominated British and International Superstars until he retired in 1984. He beat all of the major British Superstars of his era except Brian Jacks, who had previously retired through injury. Returning to the event age 50 in 2004, Hooper competed ably despite a torn pectoral muscle, finishing fourth against rivals at least 15 years younger than himself. Even now he still won the kayaking and came second in golf, almost making the final, beaten only in the end by an agonising uphill bike race.", "Over the next fifteen years, though the US version continued unabated, Superstars in the UK existed solely as a nostalgic memory for sporting clip shows, usually focussing on Kevin Keegan falling off his bike, Stan Bowles shooting the table instead of a target, or Brian Jacks eating oranges. During the 1990s BBC programmes (such as Fantasy Football League) regularly made use of this footage \u2013 and kept the show in the public spotlight \u2013 while Sky Sports began to show full-length programmes on its Sky Sports Classic channel. This, together with a new generation of television executives and sports presenters who grew up as fans of the show created interest in a revival, which finally happened as part of the 2002 Sport Relief charity event.", "| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Jacks", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Jacks", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Jacks", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Jacks", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Jacks", "* In 1979 Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks finished as joint-winners of the European Championship.", "* Three men each won two European or International Superstars championships: Swedish pole vaulter Kjell Isaksson, Dutch field hockey player Ties Kruize and British judoka Brian Jacks.

Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion.  The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors: UK runner-ups Lynn Davies and Dave Boy Green and Irish Superstars champion Pat Spillane.  The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury.  If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, Wayne Grimditch, Jim Taylor and Joe Theismann all qualifying.  Completing the line-up were two invited challengers \u2013 not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though.  Instead the organisers had asked both Emerson Fittipaldi and Rafael Septi\u00e9n to 'make up the numbers', even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success.  They did however represent Brazil and Mexico respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in Latin America.
