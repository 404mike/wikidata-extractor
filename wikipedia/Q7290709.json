In 1824 Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry unsuccessfully attempted to deprive Macdonald of the chiefship of Clan Donald by bringing an action in the Court of Session.Between 1813 and 1838, Clanranald sold almost the entirety of his estates. He attributed his financial misfortune to peculation on the part of his trustees.  However, the historical consensus has been that his ruin resulted primarily from his folly and extravagance.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
