He married Caroline Anne, daughter of Richard Edgcumbe, 2nd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, on 13 February 1812 and had issue.\nHe was elected to Parliament for Plympton Erle on 10 October 1812 and sat until 1824. In 1824 Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry unsuccessfully attempted to deprive Macdonald of the chiefship of Clan Donald by bringing an action in the Court of Session.Between 1813 and 1838, Clanranald sold almost the entirety of his estates. He attributed his financial misfortune to peculation on the part of his trustees.  However, the historical consensus has been that his ruin resulted primarily from his folly and extravagance.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Ranaldson Macdonell", "response": ["In 1824 Glengarry unsuccessfully attempted to wrest the chiefship of Clan Donald from Ranald George Macdonald by bringing an action in the Court of Session.electricscotland.com"]}, {"page": "Plympton Erle (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"| Ranald George Macdonald"]}, {"page": "George Edgcumbe, 1st Earl of Mount Edgcumbe", "response": ["Through his only son Richard, he was a grandfather of Lady Emma Edgcumbe (wife of John Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow), Lady Caroline Edgcumbe (wife of Ranald George Macdonald, 20th of Clanranald), William Edgcumbe, Viscount Valletort, Ernest Edgcumbe, 3rd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, and the Hon.

Most of the tenants emigrated to Australia. Cranstoun subsequently sold it to Hugh Mackay of Bighouse, who sold it in 1848 to a Lancashire industrialist, who by 1853 had reforested 3000 acres of it, for deer hunting.
