She is chiefly noted as one of the early leaders of the Women's Police Volunteers. Allen repeatedly sought to challenge or modernise the existing systems of the time, ensuring the Women's Police Service could become an auxiliary force after women were admitted into certain British police forces. She stood once for the House of Commons as an Independent Liberal, turning over her Women's Auxiliary Service to breaking the General Strike of 1926. Thereafter she met and talked with European fascists and anti-communist brigades, entailing frequent trips abroad and publicly joining the British Union of Fascists in 1939. In retirement Allen was an activist for animal rights.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grantham", "response": ["*Mary Sophia Allen (1878\u20131964), suffragist, women's rights activist, and Nazi sympathizer"]}, {"page": "British Union of Fascists", "response": ["Mary Sophia Allen OBE was a former branch leader of the West of England Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).
