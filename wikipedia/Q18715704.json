In came full back Tom Adamson, half backs Reginald Davies (the new captain), Harry Salt and forwards Cecil Blakemore, Jackie Foster, Billy Lane and John Payne. Brentford went on to have their best season at that time in the Football League, ending 1929 in second place and ascending to the top of the Third Division South on 25 January 1930. The good results were due to a consistently fit starting XI, which went unchanged for 21 consecutive matches in all competitions between 2 November 1929 and 15 March 1930, a club record. Top spot was held onto until a 0\u20130 draw with Exeter City on 29 March saw Plymouth Argyle overtake the Bees and automatic promotion was effectively conceded after successive defeats in mid-April. Brentford finished as runners-up and would remain in the Third Division South for 1930\u201331.

The previous season's prolific forward line of Billy Lane, Jack Lane and Cecil Blakemore again showed excellent goalscoring form during the first half of the season, with Bill Berry returning to the fold after a season in the reserve team and replacing the out-of-form John Payne.", "Brentford's 1930\u201331 season is notable for the amount of hat-tricks scored, with Billy Lane claiming three, Jack Lane two and Frederick Gamble one, which convinced West Ham United to sign Gamble in exchange for Les Wilkins in February 1931, despite Gamble having made only 13 appearances in just under two years. During the season, Billy Lane and Jack Lane each scored a hat-trick in the same match twice during a one-month period \u2013 in the 6\u20131 FA Cup first round victory over Ilford on 29 November 1930 and in the 8\u20132 league victory over Crystal Palace on Christmas Day.
