John Ravenal compares the painting's dramatic lighting to that of a stage. Sue Prideaux writes that \"Munch appears from the cigarette smoke like a genie from a bottle\". The cigarette, which the art historian Patricia Berman calls \"a nexus for marginal social identities in the 1890s\", was a symbol for \"deviancy\" and the \"social dissolution\" between class and gender boundaries. Thus, its inclusion in the self-portrait rejects traditional values and associates Munch with bohemianism and decadence. Berman also believes that the artist's depiction of himself with a \"thin, dissolving body\" and \"sallow skin\" employs physical decay to challenge social and health norms."]}]}}
