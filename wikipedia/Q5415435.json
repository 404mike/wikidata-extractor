While playing with Swansea, James was paired with his brother, David, and together they were nicknamed the 'Swansea gems' and the 'Curly haired marmosets'. The brothers were the centre of a controversial move to the league game in 1892 and switched codes twice in their careers. He had three younger brothers, Claude, Sam and Willie, the latter two playing at the same level as David and Evan towards the end of their careers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James (surname)", "response": ["* Evan James (disambiguation), multiple people", "** Evan James (poet) (1809\u20131878), composer of the Welsh national anthem", "** Evan James (civil servant) (1846\u20131923), Indian Civil Service", "** Evan James (rugby) (1869\u20131901), Welsh rugby international", "** Evan James (cricketer) (1918\u20131989), Welsh cricketer", "** Evan James (soccer) (born 1990), Canadian soccer player", "* H.
