In 1976, an Academic Department of Psychiatry was established (as part of the new Cambridge University Clinical School). Headed by Professor Sir Martin Roth (with G. E.

He gave the Litchfield (1959), Galton (1960) and Mapother (1960) lectures.  In his Maudsley (1961) lecture and later writings he questioned the concept of 'hysteria' as a valid diagnosis, showing that serious physical illness subsequently emerged in many patients initially labelled 'hysterical' and arguing that the physical illness could often account for their allegedly psychological symptoms; in this respect he disputed the Washington University in St Louis school, primarily Samuel Guze."]}, {"page": "Sir Ewan Forbes, 11th Baronet", "response": ["At the time, gender re-registration was permitted in a limited set of cases; the leading case, decided in 1965, had held that re-registration of this form was only permitted when \"the sex of a child was indeterminate at birth and it was later discovered ... that an error had been made\". The challenge was taken to the Court of Session, where the case was heard in great secrecy \u2013 no papers were publicly filed, and the judge sat in a solicitor's office rather than in open court to hear the case. However, the records of the case were made available via the National Archives of Scotland in 1991, with additional documents released in 1994.Barnes, p.166. The papers are reported as being held under reference CS258/1991/P892. They show that a total of twelve medical experts were called to give evidence, and their testimony was taken by the court to indicate that Forbes was a physical hermaphrodite, which would accord with the legal requirement of \"indeterminate at birth\". However, the medical evidence was not conclusive; Professor Martin Roth observed in evidence that he felt Forbes' condition was closer to that of a transsexual, and Professor John Strong described the medical tests involved as \"not wholly conclusive\".Barnes, p.170 The judge ruled in favour of Forbes, though it has been suggested that the judge desired to ensure the estate and the title was inherited by the \"right\" candidate, and was flexible with his judgement to obtain this result. The ruling was appealed to the Lord Advocate, who referred the matter to the Home Secretary, James Callaghan. Callaghan finally ruled in December 1968 that Forbes was the rightful holder of the title, confirming the court's decision."]}, {"page": "Aubrey Lewis", "response": ["Many esteemed psychiatrists worked under the direction of Lewis at the Institute of Psychiatry, including Martin Roth and Michael Shepherd; the latter was at great pains to point out that Lewis's impact also extended to his contributions as a clinician, scholar and researcher, particularly in the field of epidemiology, but also genetics, clinical phenomenology and biology. He was perhaps best known for his studies of melancholia and obsessional illness, and indeed guided the young Michael Shepherd on his research into morbid jealousy."]}, {"page": "Citizens Commission on Human Rights", "response": ["In 1988, the CCHR claimed that Professor Sir Martin Roth of Newcastle University had used LSD in tests on mental patients in the 1960s.
