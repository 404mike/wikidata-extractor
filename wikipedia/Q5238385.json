The Vixens were lucky not to receive further punishment, however, due to Williams hacking the resulting penalty wide. With David Parker's side firmly in the ascendancy, there was little action to speak of in the remainder of the first-half, that was until Carney bagged two quick fire braces shortly before the break.
