Algernon Fulke Egerton, Lord Ellesmere's third son.  He was then aged 29, and had been educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford; he had been destined for a political life and had no experience of managing coal mines or canals.  Since James Loch had been appointed, he had been mainly in control of the management of the Trustees, assisted by his son George Loch.  During this time the role of Fereday Smith had been diminished; initially appointed as Deputy Superintendent, his position was reduced to that of Principal Agent in 1845.  With the arrival of the inexperienced Algernon Egerton, Fereday Smith had a much greater say in the management.  During the previous four years the Lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to the canal or Runcorn Dock, despite the increasing demand for the passage of goods through the dock, and the profits made during these years became stagnant.  Fereday Smith had been keen on expansion and now his opportunity came.  He first reduced the top-heavy administration of the Trust, and then took on the planning of the expansion of the business.  The steamers owned by the Trustees had been neglected and were in a poor state; these were repaired or sold.", "In 1862 the 2nd\u00a0Earl of Ellesmere died and his son and heir, the 3rd\u00a0Earl was a minor, aged 15.  This gave Algernon Egerton even more power to invest the profits of the company in developments.  Negotiations were made to increase sea-borne trade, both British and foreign, through the canal.  Building started on a new dock at Runcorn in 1867. Work was carried out in the Mersey estuary around the docks to improve access for vessels.  Some of this was carried out in conjunction with the London and North Western Railway who were building a bridge across Runcorn Gap to take their line from Weaver Junction to Liverpool; the railway paid half the cost of the improvements, amounting to about \u00a320,000 (\u00a3 today).  Improvements were made to the Trustees' facilities at Liverpool, to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and to the Bridgewater Canal itself.  Agreements were made with the railway companies to cooperate on the transit of goods and the rates of carriage and \"the Trustees' fortunes entered a calmer phase\"."]}, {"page": "Second Disraeli ministry", "response": ["| Algernon Egerton"]}, {"page": "Wigan (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Algernon Egerton || Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty (1874\u201380)", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Hon.
