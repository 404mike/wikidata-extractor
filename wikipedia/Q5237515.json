The two men met in London and, overcoming the obstacle that neither of them spoke the language of the other fluently, they began a series of discussions of drafts and redraftings which extended over a year. Mercer's original idea concerned the situation of political prisoners held in a sports stadium, symbolising a world in collapse.  Gradually the outline shifted to the imagination of an aging writer seeking the material for a novel. Resnais proposed making the whole film into a metaphor of creation and disintegration; he also made extensive alterations to the chronology of the scenes as written by Mercer.\"Entretien avec David Mercer\", in Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais: arpenteur de l'imaginaire.

David Robinson writing in The Times was troubled by the quality of the writing:  \"Resnais's visual creations ... seem very flimsily supported on the frame of David Mercer's script ...  the writing, again, is self-conscious, stiffly literary.  The dialogue is formal, and artificial ... And the pretensions of the text only increase suspicion that it is not about very much at all.\" A non-judgmental review in the Monthly Film Bulletin emphasised the many layers of thematic cross-reference both within the film and beyond it, with echoes of other work written by David Mercer and elements from other films as well as the occasional interleaving of European and American landscapes. Gilbert Adair in Sight & Sound contrasted David Mercer's excessively literal script in which \"nothing is left unstated\" with the extent of the personal mythology and fantasy which Resnais was able to introduce into the film; he found the work enriched by its anti-naturalistic devices such as the gaffes in continuity which emerge in Clive's plotting of his novel and the exchange of voices of the characters, as well as by the disjunctive appearances of a clownish footballer in inappropriate scenes; and despite certain reservations he concluded that \"the dream cast perform together superbly\". A specific criticism of one aspect of the film appeared in a comment column of the British Medical Journal, where it was argued that the inclusion of scenes of a post-mortem on a corpse (accurate but unsparing) was \"undignified and uncivilised and ought to be condemned\" because the audience was not prepared for them and they were unnecessary to the plot.\"Medicine in the Media\", in British Medical Journal, 1 July 1978, pp. 48\u201349.", "**Won: Best Writing (David Mercer)"]}, {"page": "The Black Dwarf (newspaper)", "response": ["The editorial and production group included Ali, Clive Goodwin, Robin Fior, David Mercer, Mo Teitlebaum, Douglas Gill, Adrian Mitchell, Sheila Rowbotham, Bob Rowthorn, D.
