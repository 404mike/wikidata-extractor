This run of form saw United catapulted to the top of the League One table, a position which was maintained from 17 September after a 0\u20131 away win at Shrewsbury Town, up until 31 December, where a 2\u20131 away defeat to Bolton Wanderers saw the Iron slump into third place. This run also resulted in United seeing out a whole calendar year unbeaten at home after a 3\u20130 victory over Millwall on 17 December 2016, with the Iron's last home defeat coming on 19 December 2015 at the hands of Sheffield United. Despite managing to climb back up to the top of the table throughout January, a dramatic slump in form saw Scunthorpe go through February without recording a single win which resulted in the club slipping to fifth in the table by 11 March 2017. An upturn in the club's home form did occur again however, much to the relief of its fans, with a 2\u20131 victory over Rochdale on 14 March thanks to a last minute Matt Crooks strike. Although the Iron's home form had drastically improved, it took until 14 April for the club to record its first away victory since January with a 0\u20131 win over MK Dons. The club won its last five games of the regular season, which was enough for the Iron to finish in third with 82 points, having never been outside the top six in the table for the duration of the season. As a result of the third-place finish, the Iron were drawn against sixth-placed Millwall in the play-off semi-final. The first leg ended in a 0\u20130 stalemate, however the Iron lost out on a trip to Wembley after succumbing to a 2\u20133 home defeat in the second leg, despite having first taken the lead."]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Matt Crooks||||2010\u20132015||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.
