TRB then went to Rockfield Studios in Wales to record their next album, TRB Two. Chris Thomas, who had produced their first album, was also at the control deck for their second album, to start off with. Drummer Dolphin Taylor suggested Todd Rundgren should replace Thomas. After not being able to decide which tracks should appear on the LP, the band eventually agreed to let Rundgren choose. However, he picked two of the songs Dolphin particularly disliked, and Taylor decided that he would leave rather than play on the tracks. A day later he had calmed down somewhat and offered to return, but Robinson refused, and Preston Heyman was recruited as an emergency stand-in. His picture was included on the album cover, but there was never any intention for him to join the band permanently. Taylor's eventual replacement was Charlie Morgan who had played for Kate Bush, and went on to drum for Elton John for a further fifteen years."]}, {"page": "List of keyboardists", "response": ["*Ian Parker (The Hollies, Tom Robinson Band)"]}, {"page": "Clannad: Live in Concert", "response": ["*Ian Parker \u2013 Keyboards"]}, {"page": "TRB Two", "response": ["#\"All Right All Night\" (Robinson, Danny Kustow, Dolphin Taylor, Ian Parker) \u2013 2:59", "#\"Crossing over the Road\" (Robinson, Danny Kustow, Ian Parker) \u2013 3:39"]}, {"page": "Rubicon (The Duggans album)", "response": ["* Ian Parker"]}]}}
