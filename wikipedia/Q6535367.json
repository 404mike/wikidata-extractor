Within 24 hours, police had established a link with the murder of Marsha McDonnell, who was killed in similar circumstances in nearby Hampton 18 months earlier.

His legal team argues that serial killer Levi Bellfield could possibly be the true perpetrator of the attack. In May 2021 a bootlace, which had been tied around Megan's neck in the course of the crime, was found by Kent police who had previously mislaid it. It was suggested it could yield DNA proving Bellfield, or another individual, was the killer, but the lace was contaminated during examinations by the Forensic Science Services in 1998 and contains DNA from different sources.", "Stone's legal team argue that Levi Bellfield could be responsible for the killings. However, Bellfield's partner at the time, Johanna Collings, has insisted that she was with him on the day of the murders as it was her birthday. She had told investigators this, and it was an alibi that detectives found credible.  Collings had helped detectives convict Bellfield for his previous murders, such as in the Milly Dowler murder, giving evidence that he knew the area where her body was left well. In regards to the Russell murders, however, she commented in a BBC documentary in 2017:", "In 2013, criminologist David Wilson investigated the possibility that Levi Bellfield could be responsible for the murders in an episode of his Killers Behind Bars: The Untold Story series. He stated that he doubted the strength of Stone's conviction, in particular highlighting that \"cell confessions\" are notoriously unreliable, and conveyed his surprise that this was the basis for Stone's conviction. He also cited a letter from the prisoner Alan King, whose claims Stone's legal team had previously cited in his 2010 appeal and were deemed discredited, which said that Damien Daley admitted to him that Stone never confessed to him, and that he had claimed Stone had as he thought it would mean he would get released sooner. However, Wilson also concluded in the programme that it was unlikely that Bellfield was responsible for the murders, citing a number of differences in the way the crimes were carried out from Bellfield's previous murders, particularly how Bellfield's known crimes occurred in urban London while the murders of the Russells occurred in rural Kent.", "On 29 November 2017, BBC Wales reported that Levi Bellfield allegedly confessed to the murders to a fellow prisoner, giving details that \"would only be known by the killer\".

A notable example is Amanda Dowler, the Surrey teenager who disappeared in March 2002 and whose remains were found in Hampshire six months later. Levi Bellfield, already serving life imprisonment for two other murders, was found guilty of her murder nearly a decade later, and police said that she may have known Bellfield as he was the step-father of one of her friends at school. In 2005, 15-year-old Rochelle Holness was murdered and dismembered by her distant neighbour John McGrady on a high-rise council estate in South London, but as with the case of Amanda Dowler, police were unable to confirm whether Rochelle Holness knew her killer."]}, {"page": "Kent Police", "response": ["On 4 July 1996, Lin Russell, her daughters Megan and Josie, and their dog were attacked with a hammer in Chillenden.
