When he left school in 1986, he joined Birmingham City as a YTS trainee, and turned professional two years later. With fellow forwards Tony Rees, Andy Kennedy and Steve Whitton unavailable, Sproston, still a trainee, was given a place on the substitutes' bench for the Second Division game at home to Middlesbrough on 24 October 1987, four weeks before his 17th birthday. He came into the game as the second substitute used, to replace John Trewick, and marked his debut by receiving a head wound which needed stitches. At the time he was the second-youngest player (behind Trevor Francis) to appear for Birmingham's first team. In the youth team Sproston was tried in a variety of positions, ending up playing in midfield, but never played for the first team again. Released at the end of the 1989\u201390 season, he went on to play for a number of non-league teams in the West Midlands area.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1987\u201388 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Neil Sproston"]}]}}
