In 1961 she became the youngest member of the Constructionist group, centred on Victor Pasmore and including Adrian Heath, John Ernest, Anthony Hill, Kenneth Martin, and Mary Martin. In the 1960s her work became much more widely shown with exhibitions in London (at the Drian and Axiom galleries, the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Victoria and Albert Museum), in Chicago, and at the 1965 Tokyo Biennale and the 1969 Nuremberg Biennale.  In 1968, she gained a UNESCO Fellowship award to study in Prague, followed in 1969 by a British Council scholarship to study Russian constructivism in Leningrad. In Leningrad she met and married an architect, Adrian Ciobotaru.  In the same year she exhibited with a group of British artists in an exhibition of systems-based abstraction in Finland, followed in 1970 by her joining many of the same artists in the newly formed Systems Group and quitting the Constructionist group.  Her fellow artists in that group included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Malcolm Hughes, Jean Spencer, Michael Kidner, John Ernest, and David Saunders. She exhibited with the group in Matrix at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol in 1970, and then in 1972, at the Whitechapel Gallery in the Arts Council's Systems exhibition.  The Arts Council also commissioned her to curate the Constructivist section of the 1978 Hayward Annual, followed in the same year by her inclusion in the Arts Council's Constructive Context show."]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Steele (artist)", "response": ["Steele was a founder member of the Systems group of artists along with Malcolm Hughes (1920\u20131997) in December 1969. The group included Michael Kidner, Gillian Wise (1936\u2013), Peter Lowe (1938\u2013), Colin Jones (1934\u2013), David Saunders (1936\u2013), Jean Spencer (1942\u20131998), Richard Allen (1933\u201399), John Ernest (1922\u20131994) and others. The group arose through an exhibition of nine artists, \"Systeemi-System\", organised by Steele and his then wife, the textile designer Arja Nenonen (1936\u20132011), at the Amos Anderson Museum in Helsinki, capital of Nenonen's native Finland, in 1969. The exhibition was subtitled by Steele \"An Exhibition of Syntactic Art from Britain\", the word \"syntactic\" referring to the work \"being constructed from a vocabulary of largely geometric forms in accordance with pre-determined and often mathematically-based systems\". The Helsinki show was followed by a similar one called \"Matrix\" at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol and the 1972/3 Arts Council touring exhibition \"Systems\" which opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in March 1972. This was followed by \"Systems II\" at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1973. Individual members showed at the Lucy Milton gallery in Notting Hill, London, up to 1975, and in continental Europe during the 1970s and afterwards. The group ceased to exist in 1976 following political disagreements, but a number of its members remained on friendly terms and exhibited together.Fowler, \"Constructive and Systems Art in Britain after the Second World War\", in the catalogue for \"Elements of Abstraction: Space Space, Line & Interval in Modern British Art\", at Southampton City Art Gallery, September 2005."]}, {"page": "List of English women artists", "response": ["*Jean Spencer (1942\u20131998), abstract artist"]}]}}
