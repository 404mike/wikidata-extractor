The traditional treatment for breast cancer was a radical mastectomy, a procedure which removes the entire breast as well as surrounding muscle, tissue, and lymph nodes.  Under the influence of Scottish surgeon Reginald Murley as well as one of his colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic, he instead began to advocate procedures that removed much less material, a simple mastectomy, which only removes the breast, and a lumpectomy, which removes only a small amount of tissue. Crile performed his final radical mastectomy in 1954 and became a public advocate of alternative procedures, which are now standard. In 1955, he published an article, \"A Plea Against the Blind Fear of Cancer\", in Life magazine and a book, Cancer and Common Sense.  The medical establishment was resistant to the changes he advocated so he sought to influence them through their patients.  He was an outspoken critic of traditional procedures for decades and some of his patients, including author Babette Rosmond, became public advocates as well."]}, {"page": "Reginald Sydney Murley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald Murley"]}, {"page": "Sir Reginald Sydney Murley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald Murley"]}, {"page": "Sir Reginald Murley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald Murley"]}, {"page": "Murley", "response": ["*Reginald Murley (1916\u20131997), British surgeon"]}]}}
