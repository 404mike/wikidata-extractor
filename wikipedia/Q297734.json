Price also contributed to song writing along with Minogue, Calvin Harris, Jake Shears, Nerina Pallot, Pascal Gabriel, Lucas Secon, Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley and Kish Mauve. The album received favourable reviews from most music critics; Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's \"finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess\" and Tim Sendra from Allmusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the \"work of someone who knows exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection\". Aphrodite debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom, exactly 22 years after her first number one hit in the United Kingdom. The album's lead single, \"All the Lovers,\" was a success and became her 33rd top ten single in the United Kingdom, though subsequent singles from the album, \"Get Outta My Way\", \"Better than Today\", and \"Put Your Hands Up\", failed to reach the top ten of the UK Singles Chart.
