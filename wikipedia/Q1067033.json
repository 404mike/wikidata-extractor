It ran from (issue dates) 10 March 1973 to 5 October 1974, when it merged with Whoopee! As often happens with British comics, many names of strips were a play on popular television programmes and films of the time. The theme of the strips were mainly horror (albeit of a comic nature); similar to the later Monster Fun; indeed, Frankie Stein appeared in both comics. In an idea borrowed from the successful Whizzer and Chips, it was two comics in one; Shake being a pull-out section from Shiver. The main star of Shiver was a ghost of the same name, while the eponymous Shake was an elephant. Both had their own strips in their respective sections (The Duke's Spook and Shake).

Audience figures began to drop and in late 1973, he was replaced by comedian (and former footballer) Charlie Williams along with hostess Wendy King. Williams, of Barbadian ancestry on his father's side and Yorkshire on his mother's side, was rather a novelty on British TV at the time, being a black man with a broad Yorkshire accent. Despite his cheerfulness and amiability he proved unsuited to handling the pressure of a live TV show where things frequently went wrong.
