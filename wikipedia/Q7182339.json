Born in Cardiff, Roberts won six Wales Under 23 caps  whilst with his first club Bristol Rovers (where he is still widely regarded\n). In all Roberts was to make 175 appearances for Rovers before moving to Portsmouth in the 1973 close season as part of new chairman John Deacon's ambitious re-building plans. He was to prove such an effective player on the south coast that in 1974 he was awarded four full Welsh caps. Roberts was to hold the right back spot at Fratton Park for four seasons, his final appearance being in the 5\u20131 thrashing which consigned the club to fourth division football for the first time in their history. A very brief spell with Hereford United followed before another 100-plus stint with Exeter City ended a successful Football League career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ottery St Mary A.F.C.", "response": ["*Phil Roberts"]}, {"page": "The Creepers", "response": ["Riley then recruited ex-Membranes Mark Tilton and Phil Roberts of Shrubs, and carried on as simply \"The Creepers\".
