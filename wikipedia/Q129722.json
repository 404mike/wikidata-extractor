John Simmons and Leslie Green, who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.

In Raz's 1979 book The Authority of Law, he criticised what he called the \"weak social thesis\" to explain law. He formulates the weak social thesis as \"(a) Sometimes the identification of some laws turn on moral arguments, but also with, (b) In all legal systems the identification of some law turns on moral argument.\" Raz argues that law's authority is identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. This view he calls \"the sources thesis\". Raz suggests that any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.ch. 2, Joseph Raz, The Authority of Law (1979) Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that held that there was \"no necessary connection\" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists\u2014including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green\u2014reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder)."]}, {"page": "Philosophy of law", "response": ["In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate exists within legal positivism about the separability of law and morality. Exclusive legal positivists claim that the legal validity of a norm never depends on its moral correctness. Inclusive legal positivists claim that moral considerations may determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case. Positivism began as an inclusivist theory; but influential exclusive legal positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, later rejected the idea.", "*Leslie Green"]}, {"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["The list of noted legal scholars includes H.
