He worked as a meat-porter at Smithfield Market and played football part-time before his performances with Dagenham & Redbridge in the Conference earned him a \u00a360,000 move to Birmingham City, newly promoted to the Football League First Division (the second tier of English football), in the 1995 close season. Dagenham teammate Jason Broom described him as \"Never the most gifted player in the world but was a ferocious tackler. He used to get from box to box and scored lots of goals mainly through his excellence in the air.\" He made his debut in the Football League on 8 October 1995, as a substitute replacing Jonathan Hunt in a 2\u20130 win at home to Southend United. Only three months later Richardson joined Notts County on loan. Though he returned to Birmingham and made three more first-team appearances, including a place in the starting eleven for the second leg of the League Cup semi-final against Leeds United, Richardson joined Notts County on a permanent basis in March 1996 for a fee of \u00a3150,000."]}]}}
