He was an authority on all matters bearing on Scottish husbandry.\nHe was born at Silverwood, Kilmarnock, in 1760, a neighbourhood which he left in 1785 to go to Strathaven, Lanarkshire, where he practised for many years as a law agent. He next went to Hamilton, where he held office as one of the sheriff-substitutes of the county from 1816 up to 1822. He died in 1847. At no period did his income exceed a hundred a year, and yet out of this, with a family of twelve children, he educated four sons for liberal professions, often sending them his last guinea when they were students at college.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kilmaurs", "response": ["William Aiton in 1808 commented on the Kilmaurs town-hall and jail, saying they \"are contemptible, of little use, and ought to be pulled down.\"Aiton, William (1811).
