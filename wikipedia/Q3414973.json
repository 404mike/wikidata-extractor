From 1922 to 1942 Sisam worked at OUP under Robert William Chapman while developing his scholarly work on Anglo-Saxon, but failing in 1925 to become Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon when Tolkien was chosen. OUP successes under his stewardship include introducing 30 new titles to the Oxford World's Classics series; the creation of the Oxford Companion to English and the Oxford Latin Dictionary, and the recruitment of W.
