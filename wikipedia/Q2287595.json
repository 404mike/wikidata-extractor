When Polkinghorne argues that the minute adjustments of cosmological constants for life points towards an explanation beyond the scientific realm, Blackburn argues that this relies on a natural preference for explanation in terms of agency.  Blackburn writes that he finished Polkinghorne's books in \"despair at humanity's capacity for self-deception.\" Against this, Freeman Dyson called Polkinghorne's arguments on theology and natural science \"polished and logically coherent.\" The novelist Simon Ings, writing in the New Scientist, said Polkinghorne's argument for the proposition that God is real is cogent and his evidence elegant."]}, {"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Simon Ings (born 1965)"]}, {"page": "M.

The Economist also featured a favourable review, praising Dawkins's writing style as \"persuasive\" and lauding its educational value. Mark Fisher in The List called Dawkins a \"compelling communicator\", adding that the book was \"illuminating\" and praising the use of humorous anecdotes throughout. The Sunday Telegraph awarded it \"Book of the Week\", with reviewer Simon Ings describing Dawkins as a \"master of scientific clarity and wit\".
