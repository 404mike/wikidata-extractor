For his good displays, Vela was among the players to be offered new contracts by Lennon, as his contract was due to expire at the end of the 2014\u201315 season. He made twenty-nine appearances for the club this season, but impressive displays at right-back and in his return to a midfield position, led The Bolton News to call for Vela to be voted the club's player of the year, while Lennon said he should be proud of his displays during the season.
