The trial judge, when sentencing him on 4 August 2006, recommended that he should never be released from prison (the first time this had happened in Northern Ireland, though such sentences have been imposed on as many as 50 inmates in England and Wales) but on 27 June 2008 the Court of Appeal instead ruled that he would have to serve 35 years before parole could be considered, meaning that he is now expected to remain in prison until at least 2040 and the age of 58.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of prisoners with whole-life orders", "response": ["* Trevor Hamilton, jailed for life in August 2006 for the murder of 65-year-old librarian Attracta Haron in Northern Ireland in December 2003.
