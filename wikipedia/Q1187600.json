He was particularly influential in the British jazz and associated skiffle scenes from the 1940s to the 1960s.Preston worked independently; he was not contracted to a particular record label and would often risk cutting a record before pitching for a deal. He has been described as \"Europe's first independent record producer\", and as \"probably the most important figure to emerge from the British jazz business\". Neil Ardley described him as \"a rare Diaghilev like figure\" who steered many of the key figures of the British jazz scene into the studio when nobody else would record them.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe Meek", "response": ["He left the electricity board to work as an audio engineer for a leading independent radio production company which made programmes for Radio Luxembourg, and made his breakthrough with his work on Ivy Benson's Music for Lonely Lovers. His technical ingenuity was first shown on the Humphrey Lyttelton jazz single \"Bad Penny Blues\" (Parlophone Records, 1956) when, contrary to Lyttelton's wishes, Meek 'modified' the sound of the piano and compressed the sound to a greater than normal extent. The record became a hit. He then put enormous effort into Denis Preston's Landsdowne Studio but tensions between Preston and Meek soon saw Meek leaving. During his time he recorded US actor George Chakiris for SAGA Records and it was this that led him to Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and an independent career. He also engineered many jazz and calypso records including vocalist and percussionist Frank Holder and band leader Kenny Graham."]}, {"page": "Acker Bilk", "response": ["Bilk's success tapered off when British rock and roll made its big international impact beginning in 1964 and he shifted direction to the cabaret circuit.

In 1968 the album Blue Acker, produced by Denis Preston and with arrangements by Stan Tracey, illustrated that Bilk remained highly regarded as a musician, even by those (like Tracey) on the \"modern jazz\" side of things.
