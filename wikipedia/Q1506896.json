He notes that the \"murder of women because of insult, jealousy and infidelity, was common\" and that a woman who refused a particular suitor would often be abducted and raped. He argues that this contributed to the willingness of some Aboriginal women to associate themselves with sealers and settlers rather than their own people, so reducing the full-blooded Aboriginal population's ability to reproduce itself. He cites a number of accounts including one published in 1820 by a British officer who had spoken with Aboriginal women living with Bass Strait sealers. The officer reported that Aboriginal women made it known that their (Aboriginal) husbands treat them with \"considerable harshness and tyranny\" and that they sometimes run away and \"attach themselves to the English sailors\", finding \"their situation greatly improved by attaching themselves to the sealing gangs\".Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 379\u2013382.
