Architect Tao Ho was chosen as one of the panel judges to pick Hong Kong's new flag. He recalled that some of the designs had been rather funny and with political twists: \"One had a hammer and sickle on one side and a dollar sign on the other.\" Some designs were rejected because they contained copyrighted materials, for example, the emblem of Urban Council, Hong Kong Arts Festival and Hong Kong Tourism Board. Six designs were chosen as finalists by the judges, but were all later rejected by the PRC. Ho and two others were then asked by the PRC to submit new proposals."]}, {"page": "North Point station", "response": ["In 2001, an artwork by architect Tao Ho and local schoolchildren called North Point, My Neighbourhood was installed in the station.
