Henry Jordan played in just one match without scoring, while Albert Blount reappeared for two matches twelve years after he had last played for the County. Stalwarts Samuel Cadman and  Arthur Morton played their last games for the club."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1912", "response": ["Significant players who made their debut in the season were Richard Baggallay who went on to captain the side and Geoffrey Jackson whose death in World War I deprived the club of a useful player. New players who had shorter careers were George Burnham and Albert Blount who each played five game in the 1912 season. That was the extent of Burnham's career, but Blount reappeared in one more match fourteen years later. "]}]}}
