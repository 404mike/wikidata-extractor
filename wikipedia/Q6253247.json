He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897, Potts supported the Liberal Party candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal Party was the working man\u2019s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts retained the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper.Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His lived at the lane which led to the colliery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Potts"]}, {"page": "Barnsley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Potts", "| John Potts"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|John Potts"]}, {"page": "Osgoldcross (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*Labour: John PottsThe miners and British politics 1906-1914"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["|John Potts", "*John Potts was 74 when he returned to the house in 1935, after a four-year absence.

Although he was not part of the Lib-Lab movement, Walton courted the support of local miners, and the YMA quickly gave him its backing. Ben Pickard, General Secretary of the YMA, was a particularly strong supporter, and he claimed that Curran was in league with the Conservatives. John Potts, checkweighman at Hemsworth Colliery, also supported Walton, although with some reservations. He said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But for now, \"the Liberal party was the working man\u2019s only hope\". Walton campaigned on much of the YMA's agenda, including an eight-hour working day for miners, the introduction of old age pensions and voting reform, although he opposed their campaign for nationalisation of the mines.  He also admitted to sending coal to Yorkshire during the YMA strike of 1893, excusing this on the grounds that Yorkshire coal had been sent to County Durham during a strike up there."]}, {"page": "John Potts (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Potts (British politician)"]}]}}
