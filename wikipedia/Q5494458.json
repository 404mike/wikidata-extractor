This was the first rugby international to be played in Yorkshire with the game held at Cardigan Field in Leeds. Although Wales lost the match, it was a landmark game with Wales scoring their first try against England. Andrews was selected for the next match in the 1884 Home Nations Championship, seven days later, this time facing Scotland. Wales lost again, though both Scottish tries were heavily disputed. Andrews was never reselected to represent Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Andrews", "response": ["Fred Andrews may refer to:", "*Fred Andrews (rugby union) (1864\u20131929), Welsh rugby union player", "*Fred Andrews (baseball) (born 1952), American baseball player", "*Fred Andrews (Archie Comics), a fictional character in Archie Comics"]}, {"page": "Fred Andrews (rugby)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Andrews (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "Fred Andrews (rugby union player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Andrews (rugby union)"]}]}}
