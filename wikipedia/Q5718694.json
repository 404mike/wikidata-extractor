Henry Brooke for one. He was as straight as a die, the most honest politician I have ever known. Confronted by any problem, most ministers ask themselves, first, what is the right course to take and, in the light of this, what is politically expedient. I know of some who only asked the second question.  Henry Brooke only asked himself the first question. To him politics is not the art of the possible; it is simply doing what he considers right. This is his character, and there is nothing priggish in it.\" He also wrote, at p. 103: \"I have always respected Henry Brooke\u2019s judgment. His detractors are very bad judges of character, for he was, as I have already said, the most honest man in British politics and a man who, as Home Secretary, was most unfairly traduced.\" and Minister of Welsh Affairs in the Macmillan government, entering the Cabinet. In the former job he was the main driving force behind making London a smokeless zone.In The Times, 3 April 1984, Lord Molson wrote in a supplementary obituary notice: \"There were many who told him that to change so completely the London atmosphere was impossible, practically and financially. His persistence and his deep knowledge of government, central and local, achieved a change in the London environment which only the rapidly diminishing number of us who can remember the old \u2018pea soup\u2019 fogs can appreciate.\" Lord Molson was a former chairman of the Committee for Environmental Conservation. He attracted controversy when steering the Rent Bill through Parliament after it had already secured a Second Reading in the House of Commons under his predecessors.See Simon Heffer, Like the Roman, A Life of Enoch Powell (Hutchinson, 1996) at p. 211: \"On 18th February 1958 the Labour-supporting Daily Herald reported gossip that Brooke and Bevins were saying bluntly that they had been saddled with the Rent Bill, which they were finding it hard to defend.\"  The aim of the Act, to attract investment into the private rented market, was thwarted by the Labour Party\u2019s announcement that it would repeal the Act as soon as it took office (as indeed it did, in 1965). In the latter job, he caused anger throughout Wales through his crucial support of Liverpool Council's bid to secure Westminster's approval of an Act of Parliament to flood Cwm Tryweryn in Meirionydd, thereby by-passing Welsh local authority opposition to the scheme. However, largely in response to the protests over Tryweryn, he subsequently attracted investment to Wales, including such projects as the Severn Bridge, the steelworks at Llanwern, and the Heads of the Valleys Road. In 1961 he became the first Chief Secretary to the Treasury in modern times.Richard Davenport-Hines, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, wrote: \"His hard-working and orthodox character was appreciated in the Treasury, where he helped to prepare some unpopular policies associated with the chancellor of the exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd.\"", "Brooke was one of many politicians to receive unprecedented criticism on That Was The Week That Was on BBC Television in 1962\u201363, which called him \"the most hated man in Britain\" and ended a mock profile of him with the phrase \"If you're Home Secretary, you can get away with murder\".See Robert Shepherd, Iain Macleod (Hutchinson, 1994), at p. 287: \"The time was ripe for the satirists. The notion that modern society should be ruled by its elders and betters was increasingly rejected, yet Macmillan\u2019s Government had about it the aura of rule by elders and betters. Inevitably, ministers (especially the hapless Home Secretary Henry Brooke) became the butt of some harsh satirical comment.\" He was also involved in the passage of various new anti-drug laws, including ones banning possession of amphetamines and the growing of cannabis. As the final arbiter in death penalty cases he was the last Home Secretary to allow death sentences to go ahead for the murder of John Alan West.", "Sir Alec Douglas-Home kept Brooke in office as Home Secretary when he became Prime Minister in October 1963, and his last 12 months in office, which saw the introduction of the Police Act 1964 and the creation of a Royal Commission on Crime and Punishment, attracted much less controversy.In September 1964, a month before the General Election, he agreed with the Prime Minister that the 1957 Homicide Act was \"'unworkable' and that the next Home Secretary, of whatever party, would have to abolish the death penalty.\" Richard Lamb, The Macmillan Years 1957-1963, p 410.
