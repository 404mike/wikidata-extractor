Growing up in a musical family, with her father a violinist and conductor who had toured with Roy Orbison, and her mother a pianist, Studt began writing music at the age of six, teaching herself piano, guitar, and oboe. At 12 years old she contracted the rare bone disease osteomyelitis in her hip, leaving her bedridden. Studt used this time for her hobbies, and two years later, with the advice of her father, she recorded her first two demo albums which would go on to get her signed to Polydor. Studt released her first single \"Just a Little Girl\" in July 2002. It was followed almost a year later by \"Misfit\", which came to be her highest-charting single, reaching No. 6 in the UK charts. That same month, her debut album False Smiles was released, selling over 260,000 copies and being certified Gold. Two more singles were released, \"Under the Thumb\" in late 2003 and \"All I Wanna Do\" (a cover of the tune by Sheryl Crow) in early 2004, but only to diminishing sales that promoted Polydor to drop Studt in February 2004, all before her 18th birthday.\nFrom then on until the end of 2006, Studt stayed out of the public eye. But in 2007 it was announced that she was working on a new album, now with the Indie label 19 Entertainment. She released her first single \"Furniture\",, followed by \"Chasing the Light\"; and the album, My Paper Made Men, was issued on 5 May 2008.\nIn early 2009, Studt moved to New York City; on her return, she began building a recording studio and continued writing and recording. She went quiet from 2009 to 2017, after suffering a nervous breakdown at 22 years old and being diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder and a non-associative anxiety disorder, along with other physical illnesses during her 20s. After three hospitalizations and recovery from addiction, Studt wrote about her experiences with suffering, illness and heartbreak, \u2018...but ultimately survival and hope\u2019 which she explains she put into her songwriting for her third album.\nIn 2017, Studt announced she had been working with Toby Kid from Hatcham Social and released two teaser songs from her soon to come third album, \"I Was Jesus in Your Veins\" and \"Different Colour Pills\". The album itself, titled Happiest Girl in the Universe, was released in October 2019.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1986 in music", "response": ["*March 22 \u2013 Amy Studt, English singer-songwriter and musician"]}, {"page": "Avril Lavigne", "response": ["Lavigne has influenced a wide array of musical artists, including acts such as Billie Eilish, Rob Halford (Judas Priest), Courage My Love, 5 Seconds of Summer, Yungblud, Maggie Lindemann, Tonight Alive, Willow Smith, Amanda Palmer, Misono,  Rina Sawayama, Hey Monday, Grey, Ed Sheeran, Kailee Morgue, Charli XCX, MercyMe, Olivia Rodrigo, and Kirstin Maldonado.
