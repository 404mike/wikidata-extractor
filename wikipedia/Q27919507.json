Nearly a decade later, upon making his senior debut in 2016, he became the third-youngest player ever to play for the club and, in just his second appearance, broke Michael Owen's long-standing record to become Liverpool's youngest goalscorer.\nHe subsequently went on loan to Sheffield United but was restricted to just eight appearances before returning to Liverpool, where he was part of the club's UEFA Champions League winning squad in 2019, although he took no part in the competition himself. The following season, he joined Oxford United on loan.\nDespite being born in England, Woodburn elected to represent Wales at international level and became the nation's second youngest goalscorer behind Gareth Bale when he scored on his senior debut in 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1999", "response": ["** Ben Woodburn, British footballer"]}, {"page": "Rainhill", "response": ["*Ben Woodburn, footballer for Liverpool and Wales, attended Rainhill High School."]}, {"page": "Tattenhall", "response": ["* Ben Woodburn, professional footballer for Liverpool FC"]}, {"page": "Ben", "response": ["*Ben Woodburn (born 1999), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Youngest goalscorer: Ben Woodburn, 17 years, 45 days (against Leeds United, 29 November 2016)."]}, {"page": "1999 in Wales", "response": ["*15 October - Ben Woodburn, footballer"]}, {"page": "1999 in association football", "response": ["* 15 October: Ben Woodburn, Welsh international"]}, {"page": "1999 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 15 October \u2013 Ben Woodburn, footballer"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.
