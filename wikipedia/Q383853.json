In 1899, Amy Beach completed her Piano Concerto in C-sharp minor, the first piano concerto composed by a female American composer. Edward Elgar made sketches for a piano concerto but never completed it. In the 19th century, Henry Litolff blurred the boundary between piano concerto and symphony in his five works entitled Concerto Symphonique, and Ferruccio Busoni added a male choir in the last movement of his hour-long concerto. Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler wrote his Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, which lasts more than one hour, in 1924\u20131937. In a more general sense, the term \"piano concerto\" could extend to the numerous often programmatic concerted works for piano and orchestra from the era \u2013 Beethoven's Choral Fantasy, Liszt's Totentanz and Ruins of Athens Variations, and Richard Strauss's Burleske are only a few of the hundreds of such works.

This concept was one of thematic metamorphosis \u2014 drawing together highly diverse themes from a single melodic source. This was a concept of which Liszt was already familiar from his study of Franz Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy. Beethoven had also used such a device in his Ninth Symphony, transforming the \"Ode to Joy\" theme during the final movement.
