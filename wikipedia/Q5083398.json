Watts was a right-handed batsman.  He was born at Hinckley, Leicestershire.\nWatts made a single first-class appearance for Leicestershire against Glamorgan in the 1924 County Championship at Aylestone Road, Leicester.  With no play possible on the first two days of the match, Leicestershire won the toss on the third and final day and elected to bat, scoring just 91 runs in their first-innings, with Watts contributing 16 runs before he was dismissed by Frank Ryan.  In response, Glamorgan fared little better, making 107 in their first-innings.  The match was declared a draw following the conclusion of this innings.  This was his only major appearance for Leicestershire.\nHe died at the place of his birth on 30 January 1979.  His nephew, Gordon Lord, also played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lord", "response": ["His uncle, Charles Watts, played one first-class match for Leicestershire in 1924.
