ITV director of programmes Simon Shaps cancelled Foyle's War in 2007, but complaints and public demand prompted Peter Fincham (Shaps' replacement) to revive the programme after good ratings for 2008's fifth series.

This forced Horowitz to discard scripts set during most of 1943 and 1944, resulting in time jumps of nine months to a year between episodes; previous series had gaps of a month at most. In April 2008, the presumed final episode, \"All Clear\" (during which the end of the war is announced) was broadcast."]}, {"page": "Love Island (2005 TV series)", "response": ["Following disappointing ratings over the two spring-summer periods, the show was axed by ITV's director of television, Simon Shaps, in November 2006."]}, {"page": "Claudia Rosencrantz", "response": ["In December 2005, ITV's Director of Television Simon Shaps testified to Rosencrantz's influence in saying that she \"has been responsible for some of the biggest entertainment hits in ITV's history.
