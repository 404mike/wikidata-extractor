The concept was first termed \"postural schema\" to describe the disordered spatial representation of patients following damage to the parietal lobe of the brain. Head and Holmes discussed two schemas (or schemata): one body schema for the registration of posture or movement and another body schema for the localization of stimulated locations on the body surface. \"Body schema\" became the term used for the \"organized models of ourselves\". The term and definition first suggested by Head and Holmes has endured nearly a century of research with clarifications as more has become known about neuroscience and the brain.thumb|A portrait of Henry Head, the pioneering English neurologist who first defined and used the term \"body schema\"."]}, {"page": "Dundalk Grammar School", "response": ["*Sir Gordon Morgan Holmes, neurologistProfile, brain.oxfordjournals.org; accessed 3 May 2015."]}, {"page": "Gordon Morgan", "response": ["*Sir Gordon Morgan Holmes (1876\u20131965), British neurologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| Gordon Morgan Holmes||11/05/1933||22 February 1876 \u2013 29 December 1965"]}, {"page": "Holmes rebound phenomenon", "response": ["The phenomenon was first described by Gordon Morgan Holmes and Thomas Grainger Stewart in a paper published in 1904, though it was not named until a 1917 paper published by Holmes."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1933", "response": ["*Sir Gordon Morgan Holmes"]}, {"page": "1951 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Gordon Morgan Holmes, , Consulting Physician, Charing Cross Hospital and National Hospital for Nervous Diseases."]}, {"page": "1917 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Temp Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Morgan Holmes, MD, Royal Army Medical Corps"]}, {"page": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1", "response": ["While the hereditary patterns were clearly distinct, there was on-going debate well into the 1940s over whether Marie's ataxia was really distinct from Freidreich's ataxia and Str\u00fcmpell's paraplegia and if these category's themselves represented a single disease or many. This was because of the heterogenous nature of hereditary ataxias, the similarity of symptoms, and the lack of understood biochemical mechanisms. Further frustration with the ambiguity of terms introduced by Marie and Friedreich resulted in the creation of other systems to classify ataxias. Gordon Morgan Holmes and Godwin Greenfield each developed systems of categorizing ataxias, giving rise to categories called olivopontocerebellar atrophy and spinocerebellar degradation, though little consensus between the systems was achieved, and many terms are used interchangeably."]}]}}
