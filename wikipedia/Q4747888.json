He made his highest score of 77 in his third match for the club, an innings victory over Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Hind continued to play steadily in the upper-middle order for most of the rest of the 1876 season. At the start of the  1877 season, Hind hit a rough patch in his batting form, and was at times replaced in the batting order by Charles Regan. However he achieved his best bowling performance with 4-9 against MCC and managed an innings of 43 against Hampshire in his penultimate first-class fixture.\nHind was a right-handed batsman and played 30 innings in 16 first-class matches with a top score of 77 and an average of 13.06. He was also a right-arm round-arm medium pace bowler who took 24 wickets at an average of 17.45 and a best performance of 4-9.In 1880, Hind took eight wickets in total for Halifax in a match against Gentlemen of Canada, a team which included former Nottinghamshire player Walter Wright.
