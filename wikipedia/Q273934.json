As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.Charlton, p. 349."]}, {"page": "BBC Light Programme", "response": ["* Annie Nightingale"]}, {"page": "The Rapture (band)", "response": ["Roccoforte also started playing shows with Wah Together, a new rock band which also consists of guitarist Steve Schiltz (Longwave, bassist Phil Mossman LCD Soundsystem and vocalist Jaiko Suzuki.

When Sybil Ruscoe left her role as Simon Mayo's weather and travel reporter on the breakfast show, Brambles took over that slot, thereby keeping her on air every day over two separate programmes. On her own shows she sometimes worked standing up to maintain a more \"live\" feel, claiming she found it difficult to keep her demeanour lively enough if she was seated. The combination with Mayo worked quite well until a minor revamp in 1990 saw Brambles progress to a 90-minute drivetime show and then, to the important lunchtime slot when Gary Davies went to weekends.
