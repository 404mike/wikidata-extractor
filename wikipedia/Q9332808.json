Thatcher introduced Nott to the waiting press, stating that \"The Secretary of State for Defence has just come over to give me some very good news and I think you'd like to have it at once\".  Nott then read out a pre-prepared statement that revealed that the landings had taken place on South Georgia at around 4pm British Summer Time and that at around 6pm the Argentine garrison had surrendered, after offering little resistance.  He said that casualties for the Argentine side could not yet be confirmed but that none had been reported for the British forces.  Nott concluded by reading the text of a signal sent by the commander of Operation Paraquet \"Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the White Ensign flies alongside the Union Jack in South Georgia.
