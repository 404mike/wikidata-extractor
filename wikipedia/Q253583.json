He was a pioneer in the field of nephrology, the branch of internal medicine that deals with diseases of the kidney. Addis described the pathogenesis of haemophilia in 1911 and was the first to demonstrate that normal plasma could correct the defect in haemophilia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linus Pauling", "response": ["In 1941, at age 40, Pauling was diagnosed with Bright's disease, a renal disease. Following the recommendations of Thomas Addis, who actively recruited Ava Helen Pauling as \"nutritionist, cook, and eventually as deputy 'doctor'\", Pauling believed he was able to control the disease with Addis's then-unusual low-protein salt-free diet and vitamin supplements. Thus Pauling's initial \u2013 and intensely personal \u2013 exposure to the idea of treating disease with vitamin supplements was positive."]}, {"page": "Gavin Newsom", "response": ["Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, to Tessa Thomas (n\u00e9e Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a state appeals court judge and attorney for Getty Oil.

Usually, clearance is measured in L/h or mL/min. The quantity reflects the rate of drug elimination divided by plasma concentration. Excretion, on the other hand, is a measurement of the amount of a substance removed from the body per unit time (e.g., mg/min, \u03bcg/min, etc.). While clearance and excretion of a substance are related, they are not the same thing. The concept of clearance was described by Thomas Addis, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Americans", "response": ["* Thomas Addis, physician and scientist"]}, {"page": "Addis count", "response": ["It is named for Thomas Addis."]}, {"page": "Thomas Chalmers Addis Jr.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Addis"]}, {"page": "Thomas Chalmers Addis, Jr.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Addis"]}, {"page": "Major urinary proteins", "response": ["Urinary proteins were first reported in rodents in 1932, during studies by Thomas Addis into the cause of proteinuria. They are potent human allergens and are largely responsible for a number of animal allergies, including to cats, horses and rodents. Their endogenous function within an animal is unknown but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in chemical communication between animals, functioning as pheromone transporters and stabilizers in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote aggression in male mice, and one specific Mup protein found in male mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as signals between different species: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.", "Humans in good health excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 physicians and scientists have been interested in proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease.In that year Richard Bright first related kidney disease, later to become known as Bright's disease, with albuminous urine. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, it was not until the 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day)."]}, {"page": "Addis (name)", "response": ["* Thomas Addis (1881\u20131949), British-American physician-scientist"]}, {"page": "Addis, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Addis"]}, {"page": "American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born", "response": ["Members or individuals affiliated with the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born included: Albert Einstein, Bela Lugosi, Rex Stout, Emily Balch, Donald Ogden Stewart, Joris Ivens, Edward G.
