His trademark pieces are finding an audience member's card in his mouth and a humorous straitjacket escape. Lovell appeared on VH1's popular reality show Celebracadabra, on which he and other magicians trained celebrities to perform magic for audiences.\nThe author of sixteen books, including How to Cheat at Everything: A Con Man Reveals the Secrets of the Esoteric Trade of Cheating, Scams, and Hustles (first published as Billion Dollar Bunko), which covers cons and scams, Lovell starred in a one-man off-Broadway show called \"Strange and Unusual Hobbies\". It ran for over eight years at the SoHo Playhouse, and the Wall Street Journal complimented it as \"a dazzling 70-minute show.\" The well-reviewed show combined Lovell's off-the-wall sense of humor with demonstrations of his uncanny card cheating and \"jaw-dropping\" magic.\nFormerly residing in New York City, Simon was a regularly featured performer in \"Monday Night Magic\", the oldest running off-Broadway show featuring an evening of magicians and related performers.\nIn 1987, Lovell appeared in the first series of ChuckleVision, where he would perform a magic trick.\nHe was the consultant con man as of season 2 for Matt Bomer in the show \"White Collar\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "ChuckleVision", "response": ["In the first two series (1987\u20131989), each episode focused on a certain topic, in the style of Blue Peter.
