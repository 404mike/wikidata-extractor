He is a specialist in early Celtic art and contemporary Australian Indigenous art.Megaw was educated at University College School, Hampstead and the University of Edinburgh, and worked on a number key sites in Europe as well as carrying out pioneering work in the South Sydney region of Australia. He undertook extensive research with his wife, Ruth Megaw, on the art of the European pre-Roman Iron Age; they wrote several publications together. In 1961, after working as an editor at Thames and Hudson, he accepted a position at the University of Sydney as Lecturer and subsequently Senior Lecturer in European Iron Age Archaeology. From 1971 to 1982 he held the Chair of Archaeology and Head of Department at Leicester University.  \nHis first appointment at Flinders University, Adelaide, was in 1979. In 1995 he was appointed Professor of Visual Arts and Archaeology at Flinders, retiring in 2003.His other appointments have included Visiting Professorship at the University of Edinburgh and Senior Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Glasgow (from 1998 with his wife). Ruth Megaw died in 2013.He was elected to the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1985 and in 2004 was made a Member of the Order of Australia.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "La T\u00e8ne culture", "response": ["The Early Style of La T\u00e8ne art and culture mainly featured static, geometric decoration, while the transition to the Developed Style constituted a shift to movement-based forms, such as triskeles.

He also visited Vincent Megaw's excavation of the Curracurrang rock shelter and was taken by Norman Tindale to witness a living hunter-gatherer society at the Papunya indigenous community. In November 1965, he undertook a lecture tour of the U.S., giving talks at Pennsylvania State University, Temple University, the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, the University of Colorado, and Colorado Women's College. That year Hutchinson published a book that Clark had co-written with Piggott, Prehistoric Societies, and in 1967 Thames and Hudson published Clark's coffee table book, The Stone Age Hunters. In 1968 he published a revised second edition of World Prehistory, although it attracted criticism from archaeologists studying Africa for making significant errors about that continent. In 1968 he travelled via Moscow to Japan in order to attend the International Conference of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, using the trip to spend time in Taiwan, the Philippines, and New Zealand. In 1969 he was then appointed visiting Hitchcock Professor at the University of California-Berkeley; his lectures there were published as Aspects of Prehistory by the University of California Press in 1970. He published a classification system of five \"lithic modes\" or types of stone tools in 1969, which is still in use today.

The two other figures most prominent in the field were Malcolm Chapman with his The Celts: The Construction of a Myth (1992) and  Simon James of the University of Leicester with his The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention? (1999). In particular, James engaged in a particularly heated exchange with Vincent Megaw (and his wife Ruth) on the pages of Antiquity. The Megaws (along with others such as Peter Berresford Ellis) suspected a politically motivated agenda; driven by English nationalist resentment and anxiety at British Imperial decline; in the whole premise of Celtosceptic theorists (such as Chapman, Nick Merriman and J. D. Hill) and that the anti-Celtic position was a reaction to the formation of a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. For his part, James stepped forward to defend his fellow Celtosceptics, claiming that their rejection of the Celtic idea was politically motivated, but invoked \"multiculturalism\" and sought to deconstruct the past and imagine it as more \"diverse\", rather than a Celtic uniformity."]}, {"page": "Celtic art", "response": ["After about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into \"plastic\" and \"sword\" styles, the latter mainly found on scabbards and the former featuring decoration in high relief.
