The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and the avant-garde. The single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.", "In 1972, Partridge became closer acquainted with Gregory, a diabetic then suffering from a bout of depression, while working as an assistant at the Bon Marche record shop in Swindon. Gregory was playing the Mahavishnu Orchestra's album The Inner Mounting Flame (1971), which he later called \"one of the watershed moments in my musical education.\" Partridge met Colin Moulding at the Stage Bar on Swindon's Old Town's Union Row, later known as Long's. Moulding had been playing bass since 1970 \"because I liked music [and] I thought that playing a bass, with four strings, would be infinitely easier than playing a guitar, with six strings. That was a horrible misconception!\". At the end of 1972, Moulding and drummer Terry Chambers joined Partridge's band, replacing Nervous Steve and Paul Wilson, and the group was renamed \"Star Park (Mark II)\". Other members would frequently join and leave the group.", "Until 2016, Moulding remained largely inactive as a musician. In October 2017, he and Terry Chambers issued a four-song EP, Great Aspirations (credited to \"TC&I\"). Its release coincided with a televised documentary film of the band's career, XTC: This Is Pop, which premiered on Sky Arts on 7 October. The documentary featured new interviews with Partridge, Gregory, Moulding and Chambers. Moulding praised the film and commented on the possibility of a full-fledged XTC reunion: \"They say never say never, don't they? It would seem unlikely, put it that way.\" As of January 2018, Partridge maintained that the group would \"not be recording together again.\" From 29 October to 1 November, TC&I performed four sold-out shows at Swindon's Art's Centre, in Old Town. It was the first time Moulding and Chambers had played a live gig in decades. In January 2019, a statement released through social media announced that TC&I had disbanded, and that Moulding has once again put his music career on hold in order to spend more time with his family. In 2020, Chambers began touring with a band named EXTC, performing a repertoire of XTC songs. \"Terry Chambers' new band EXTC goes live\" - News article on XTCBumperBookofFunforBoysandGirls website, Published 18-02-2020, Retrieved 27-09-2021 ", "Terry Chambers was the band's original drummer. He was described by Partridge as \"the [drummer] that's been the most primitive, but probably the most thrilling for inventiveness, because he would blunder into [different ideas].\" One of his characteristic techniques was the use of hi-hat chokes. Following his departure in 1983, the group employed a succession of session drummers for their studio recordings. This included Pete Phipps (Mummer and The Big Express), Prairie Prince (Skylarking and Apple Venus), Pat Mastelotto (Oranges & Lemons), and Dave Mattacks (Nonsuch). Drum machines also began to be incorporated into the group's sound. None of the studio drummers were accepted as official members of the band. Partridge explained that this was because the group did not tour and because \"There's lots of local, interpersonal language that means nothing to anybody outside the band and is very difficult to bring people into.\"", "* Terry Chambers \u2013 drums (1972\u20131982)", "  bar:Terry      text:Terry Chambers", "* Great Aspirations (2017, Colin Moulding and Terry Chambers reunion EP)"]}, {"page": "Pete Phipps", "response": ["Phipps was a founder member of The Glitter Band (originally known as The Glittermen), who started as Gary Glitter's backing band, and went on to success in their own right, having six top ten singles in the UK in the mid-1970s.Thompson, Grant (1975) \"Gary to Miss Glitter Tour\", Sydney Morning Herald, 8 June 1975, retrieved 10 February 2010Glitter Band, ChartStats, retrieved 10 February 2010 He was later a member of the band Random Hold, who toured with XTC in 1979, leading to him playing drums on the XTC album Mummer after Terry Chambers left the band, and he returned for the recording of their next album The Big Express.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas \"[ XTC Biography]\", AllMusic, retrieved 10 February 2010Twomey, Chris (2002) XTC: Chalkhills and Children, Omnibus Press, , p. 130, 137 He also played drums for Eurythmics, playing on their UK number one album Touch, joining the band for their MTV-broadcast performance at the Heaven nightclub in London, and playing live with the band into 1984.Strong, Martin C.
