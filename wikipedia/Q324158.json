Other authors such as Philip James Bailey, or Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, like Newman, achieved much fame with their writings about the subject of mortality, but, unlike both Goethe and Bailey, Newman took the subject of death and the soul's \"life\" in the realm eternal, one step further. Because The Dream of Gerontius deals with the journey of the soul from life to death to Heaven, something not many authors and poets had done up to that point, many people wondered what inspirations Newman was drawing from when he wrote it. Some believed that Newman drew inspiration from an 11th-century hymn of Saint Peter Damian, \"De Die Mortus Rythmus\", when constructing his vision, but there are some who feel that Newman\u2019s inspirations and motives were more personal. Due to its title, some believed that Newman drew inspiration for the poem from dreams and not from any religious text. Some also felt that the poem itself might not even deal with death at all, but rather be a vision of an old man\u2014maybe even Newman himself\u2014worrying about life after death. Besides these various groups there were also some who viewed \"Newman himself as carrying greater religious authority and credibility than any available creed or communion\", and that the \"Dream of Gerontius\" was a vision of sage wisdom by a Cardinal in the Catholic Church.

According to the scholar Christopher Beach, the images of Lucifer and a whale allow a slave to express themselves, though society denies them a voice. Beach calls the phrasing \"Now Lucifer was not dead\" \"one of the most striking moments in all of Whitman's poetry.\" The section is Whitman's most clear condemnation of slavery and his most clear effort to understand the thoughts of an enslaved person. This passage was unprecedented among white American poets, but was cut in the 1881 Leaves of Grass, for unclear reasons. Whitman wrote no comparable poetry after 1855. Ed Folsom in 2000 called the passage \"one of the most powerful and evocative passages about slavery in American literature\"."]}]}}
