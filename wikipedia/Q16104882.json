Playing her brother Eli was the comedian Jimmy Jewel and the series was centred on their characters' love-hate relationship as they tried to run their small family business, Pledge's Purer Pickles. As they bickered onscreen and traded insults such as \"knocked-kneed knackered old nosebag\" and \"big girl's blouse\", the insults continued off-screen as the two performers disliked each other intensely. A film version of the series was made by Hammer Films in 1972Nearest and Dearest (the same year she was a subject of This Is Your Life when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews).

Theirs was an awkward courtship - Alf withdrew his first proposal, telling Renee that he had been drunk when he asked her - but when he proposed again, they married. The marriage seemed doomed from the start - Alf punched Renee's stepfather, Joe Hibbert, at the reception for suggesting that the only reason he had married Renee was to get the corner shop. Renee, however, made it clear that the shop was hers and Alf should continue to work at the post office. After a lorry crashed into the pub in 1979, burying Alf under tons of wood, the couple re-assessed their lives. They decided to buy a sub-post office in Grange-Over-Sands in 1980 and Renee took driving lessons. It was while learning to drive that Renee stalled Alf's car at a red traffic light in a country lane. While Alf got out of the car to change places, a lorry coming the other way hit the car and Renee was killed. Alf, who had been drinking, was unharmed and later told Ken Barlow (William Roache) that he felt guilty as seconds before Renee died, they were arguing about her driving and this was the last thing he ever said to her."]}, {"page": "Annie Walker (Coronation Street)", "response": ["In her final years at the Rovers, age was no obstacle to Annie, and she continued to rule with an iron fist.

At 67, Annie decided to learn to drive, and to pass her test after fewer than 86 lessons - the number her friend and rival Nellie Harvey (Mollie Sugden) had taken. To the surprise of all (after her first lesson ended with her hitting a lamp post), she passed her test first time and bought a second-hand Rover 2000. Not long after getting the car, Annie was stopped by the police while doing a turn in the road, and was breathalysed. Much to her horror, the crystal turned green. A blood test taken at the police station proved Annie was below the limit, but by that time her companion Kitty Stonely (Stella Moray) had already spread the word among Annie's posh friends at the Lady Victuallers."]}, {"page": "Barbara (TV series)", "response": ["*Madge Hindle - Doreen", "*Madge Hindle - Doreen"]}, {"page": "David Ross (actor)", "response": ["Ross also played Inspector Martin in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Sherwin in Basil, a cheating betting shop owner in the BBC One comedy Goodnight Sweetheart, Basil Tyler (a kind-natured, well meaning cab driver and postman who was unlucky in love) in John Sullivan's BBC comedy drama Roger Roger, and Donald Moss (a DHSS officer) in Alan Bleasdale's Boys from the Blackstuff.
