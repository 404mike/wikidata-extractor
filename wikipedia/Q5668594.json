He also acted as a consulting engineer both at home and abroad.He was awarded the Telford Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1875 for his paper on The Construction of Gasworks. He also received their Watt Medal and George Stephenson Medal.\nHe served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers from November 1917 to November 1918.  In this capacity, he proposed that senior, experienced civil engineers should be brought in at early stages of discussion regarding high value government engineering projects and that their involvement should extend beyond their usual technical role to that of finance and management.  David Lloyd George, then prime minister, agreed to consider this but no further action was taken.  Jones died in 1925.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Jones", "response": ["*Harry Edward Jones (1843\u20131925), British civil engineer "]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Jones", "response": ["* Harry Edward Jones (1843\u20131925), British civil engineer"]}, {"page": "Telford Medal", "response": ["| Harry Edward Jones||||'The Construction of Gasworks' ", "* Harry Edward Jones"]}]}}
