For five decades he lectured on music appreciation for WEA London and also taught on the music faculties at the University of Cambridge, the University of London, and the University of Surrey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1953 in music", "response": ["* The Tinners of Cornwall (Inglis Gundry), premiered 30 September 1953 at Rudolf Steiner Hall, conducted by Geoffrey Corbett."]}, {"page": "Mill Hill School", "response": ["* Inglis Gundry, composer, novelist, musicologist, music pedagogue and writer"]}, {"page": "Furry Dance", "response": ["The meaning of Hal-an-Tow is unclear. The word kalann means the first of the month in Cornish, but the first letter mutates to an \"h\" in some circumstances. It has been suggested that \"tow\" means garland in Cornish. This is not correct. Some have suggested that Hal-an-Tow means \u201craise the roof\". In Helston tow is pronounced to rhyme with cow and not toe. The Cornish word \"tew\" means fat, and a recent explanation of the name is that Hal-an-Tow means the eve of the fattening time. The version of the Hal-an-Tow sung by The Watersons and other folk groups has never been sung in Helston. The Helston song does not include the verse about cuckolds and horns. These words appear to have been added from Shakespeare's play As You Like It at some time by someone who does not know the history of the Helston song. See for example the version in Sabine Baring-Gould's Songs of the West (which contains errors) and the versions in Canow Kernow edited by Inglis Gundry, such as the one recorded by William Sandys in 1846. The words of the Hal-an-Tow as it is currently sung in Helston are:Hal-an-Tow Alan Kent on Helston's 'Flora Day' tradition"]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Inglis Gundry (1923)"]}, {"page": "2000 in British music", "response": ["*13 April \u2013 Inglis Gundry, composer, novelist and musicologist, 94"]}, {"page": "Bladder pipe", "response": ["*Inglis Gundry.
