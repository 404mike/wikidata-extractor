To date, Idlewild have released nine full-length studio albums.\nInitially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material\u2014once described by the NME as \"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\") to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on The Remote Part and Warnings/Promises.\nIn 2010, the band entered an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in late 2013 to record their seventh album, Everything Ever Written, released in 2015.

Upon moving to Scotland, he wanted to start a band that emulated the sound of those releases. In late 1995, Idlewild formed in Edinburgh, with its initial line-up consisting of Woomble on vocals, Rod Jones on guitar, Phil Scanlon on bass, and Colin Newton on drums. After a year of touring, the band released their debut single, \"Queen of the Troubled Teens\", in March 1997 through local label Human Condition. The band parted ways with Scanlon and replaced him with Bob Fairfoull. As \"Queen of the Troubled Teens\" received attention from media outlets, the band signed with Fierce Panda Records. With this label, the band released their next single \"Chandelier\" in December 1997.

On the same night, the two were introduced to guitarist Rod Jones and the three kept in contact afterwards, meeting up to listen to music.
