For example, Steven V. Ley and coworkers used an allylstannanation of a threose-derived aldehyde to construct the macrolide antascomicin B, which structurally resembles FK506 and rapamycin, and is a potent binder of FKBP12. The Krische allylation was used to prepare the polyketide natural product (+)-SCH 351448, which is a macrodiolide ionophore bearing 14 stereogenic centers."]}, {"page": "Yusuf Hamied 1702 Professor of Chemistry", "response": ["* Steven V.
