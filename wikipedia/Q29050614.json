She was featured in the 1907 and 1911 Oireachtas na Gaeilge exhibitions. She exhibited ten works with the RHA between 1904 and 1921, largely portraits and statuettes. One such portrait was the Gaelic League activist, Thomas O'Neill Russell from 1904. Vanston wished to use her art for patriotic purposes, and was associated with the Irish Art Companions, a group founded in 1904 by Charles Tindal Gatty with the aim of reviving Irish art, particularly to provide an alternative to imported ecclesiastical statues. At 27\u201328 Clare Street, Dublin, the group had its own plaster mill and could cast primarily ecclesiastical statues, which were then bronzed and tinted. A 1907 plaque by Vanston for the group was exhibited at the 1910 Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland exhibition. The plaque was titled The lament of Banba or Erin mourns for her dead heroes, and The Irish Times called it \"one of the most beautiful decorative designs we have seen here for some time . . . it shows wonderful grace and freedom.\" She was also involved with the United Arts Club, a group which included Jack Butler Yeats."]}, {"page": "Charles Gatty", "response": ["* Charles Tindal Gatty (1851\u20131928), British antiquary, musician, author, and lecturer"]}]}}
