As a player he was a midfielder from 1990 to 2002. He played Premier League football for Middlesbrough, Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City. He also more than 300 appearances in the Football League also appearing for Crystal Palace and Birmingham City as well as a short spell in La Liga with CA Osasuna. From 2003 to 2007 he managed both Spennymoor United and Spennymoor Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billingham", "response": ["* Jamie Pollock, former footballer for Manchester City"]}, {"page": "Oxted", "response": ["*Footballers who have lived in Oxted include Juli\u00e1n Speroni, goalkeeper for Crystal Palace, and former footballers Ian Pearce, Nicky Forster and Jamie Pollock."]}, {"page": "Georgi Kinkladze", "response": ["Manchester City's downward trajectory toward the Second Division continued in the 1997\u201398 season, and on 17 February 1998, manager Frank Clark was sacked. His replacement, Joe Royle, was appointed City manager on 18 February 1998. He had a reputation for playing defensive midfielders, which led to his Everton team being nicknamed the \"Dogs of War\". Royle viewed Kinkladze as an unaffordable luxury in a relegation battle, and in his first board meeting as Manchester City manager, he opened proceedings with the words \"We have to sell Kinkladze\".Blue Moon Rising, p. 157. After playing the first two games under Royle, a 1\u20132 loss on 18 February against Ipswich Town, and a 3\u20131 win against Swindon Town on 23 February, Kinkladze sustained an ankle injury, which sidelined him for a month. He made his return at Port Vale on 14 March, despite having taken little part in training in the preceding week. Port Vale were a team with a physically robust approach, and used the muddy conditions to their advantage.Kinkladze: The Perfect 10?, p. 121. Kinkladze was played out of position on the right wing, much to his displeasure, and gave a performance that the Manchester Evening News summarised as \"barely noticeable\". Vale defeated City 2\u20131, and Royle severely criticised Kinkladze for a lack of effort, dropping him for the next six games.Blue Moon Rising, p. 158. In 2005, Royle explained his view of Kinkladze in his autobiography: \"To the supporters he was the only positive in all that time. To me, he was a big negative. I am not saying that City's ills were all down to Kinkladze, but there was too much about the whole Kinkladze cult phenomenon that wasn't right ...too often since his arrival, the team had under-performed. I couldn't help deducing that contrary to popular opinion, he would be my weak link not my strong one.\" With two games remaining, Manchester City were in the relegation places, and Kinkladze was restored to the starting lineup for the home match against Queens Park Rangers (QPR). The QPR team contained Vinnie Jones, who had a violent reputation and played using the axiom \"if their top geezer gets sorted out early doors, you win\". Jones tried to apply his philosophy to Kinkladze, even targeting him in the tunnel before the start of the match.Kinkladze: The Perfect 10?, p. 124. Kinkladze opened the scoring with a free kick, but City could not maintain their lead. Defending described by The Observer's reporter as a \"calamity\" culminated in an unusual own goal from Jamie Pollock, and meant the match ended in a 2\u20132 draw. City were relegated for the second time in three seasons despite a final day 5\u20132 win against Stoke City.Blue Moon Rising, p. 164. In total, Kinkladze made 119 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 22 goals. He played regular international football during this period of his career, including in a 0\u20130 draw with three-time World Cup winners Italy."]}, {"page": "Spennymoor Town F.C.", "response": ["In June 2006, a management team of Jamie Pollock and Moors favourite Jason Ainsley was put in place. Together they put together a strong squad of players. After a slow start, consisting of 6 away games out of the first seven, and a high number of draws, the squad went from strength to strength. They went unbeaten in the league from November, until 7 April 2007, where they travelled to Penrith. Backed by a travelling support of over 150 fans, if they won and Seaham lost, they would be champions. At half time, the news came through that Seaham were losing 3\u20131. Spennymoor's place was booked as champions when Tom Jones netted an 87th-minute winner.", "During the summer of 2007, then Manager Jamie Pollock left the club, stating \"he wanted to concentrate on getting his coaching badges and pursue his career at a higher level\" and moors favourite Jason Ainsley was swiftly given the position of first team manager. Yet another crisis hit the club during this summer when the council evicted the club from its home of 103 years. However, after a lot of good work by individuals of the football club, in particular the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Secretary Jonathan Le Poidevin, a new 25-year lease was agreed on 25 September 2007, securing the future of the club.", "| Jamie Pollock"]}, {"page": "Robert Ullathorne", "response": ["After having been at Norwich for eight years, Ullathorne was subject of interest from Crystal Palace but took the opportunity of a move to Spanish Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side CA Osasuna on a free transfer, the first under the Bosman ruling from England where he was joined by fellow Englishman Jamie Pollock who arrived from Middlesbrough later in 1996."]}, {"page": "1993 FIFA World Youth Championship", "response": ["* Jamie Pollock"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Jamie Pollock ||  Manchester City || 20 March 1998 || \u00a31,000,000", "| Jamie Pollock"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Jamie Pollock || Middlesbrough || 15 November 1996 || \u00a31,500,000", "| Jamie Pollock"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["*  Jamie Pollock \u2013  Crystal Palace, 11 August, \u00a375,000"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["*  Jamie Pollock"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["| Jamie Pollock || Crystal Palace || 17 May 2001", "!scope=\"row\"|Jamie Pollock"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Clyde F.C. season", "response": ["|  Jamie Pollock"]}, {"page": "Pollock (surname)", "response": ["* Jamie Pollock (born 1974), English footballer", "* Jamie Pollock (woman soccer player), American soccer player"]}]}}
