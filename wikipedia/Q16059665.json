B. Johnson to swim the English Channel. He became inspired to try, and left his job to begin training, first at Lambeth Baths, then in the cold waters of the Thames, the English Channel and Hollingworth Lake. His early training was backed by Fred Beckwith who was the \"Professor\" at Lambeth Baths. Beckwith organised a spectacle by showing Webb swimming miles in the River Thames. Webb completed \u2018nearly six miles\u2019 (10\u00a0km), but the poor public interest meant that Beckwith lost money. As a result, Webb took another manager."]}, {"page": "Frederick Edward Beckwith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Beckwith"]}, {"page": "Charles Bastard", "response": ["His father, a bootmaker by trade, had been taught to swim by Captain Beckwith, father of Fred Beckwith (1821\u20131898), and applied his knowledge in teaching other colonists at what passed in those days for a bathing pool \u2014 a fenced-off section of the River Torrens, upstream from what is now the Morphett Street bridge."]}]}}
