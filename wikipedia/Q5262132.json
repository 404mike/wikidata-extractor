He supported the South-African-backed anti-SWAPO white forces in Africa and endorsed the Namibia regime in 1981. In his Guardian obituary of Colvin, Andrew Roth wrote that the MP \"was also a somewhat secretive former propagandist for apartheid South Africa\". He defended the whites of southern Africa, accepting invitations to visit South Africa, then under apartheid, and Bophuthatswana, a Bantustan ('homeland') set up for blacks by the South African government. He urged that the 'homelands', which were not internationally recognised, should be accepted. Although he supported reformist Denis Worrall's election campaign in 1987, the following year he criticised the BBC for broadcasting the concert tribute to Nelson Mandela. Connected to the Strategic Network International (SNI), a lobbyist front set up in 1985 to campaign against the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa, Colvin was involved in finding sympathetic Conservative MPs to visit the 'homelands' on expenses paid trips. The Conservative activist Derek Laud was involved in SNI and was responsible for recommending Colvin to the group."]}, {"page": "Big Brother (British series 6)", "response": ["!scope=\"row\" | Derek Laud"]}]}}
