Gawler was recalled and replaced by George Edward Grey in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in Glen Osmond that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned."]}, {"page": "Belair National Park", "response": ["Belair was originally inhabited by the Kaurna Aboriginal people.

The first European to settle in the area was a squatter, E. Nicholas Foott, who in 1839 dug a well and built a stone cottage, spending \u00a3500 despite not holding a title to the land. In 1840, South Australian governor George Gawler set the land aside for a government farm, forcing Foott to leave the land, though he was paid \u00a3300 for his improvements to the land (he later became a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly)."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Zionism", "response": [";1841: George Gawler, previously the governor of South Australia, starts to encourage Jewish settlements in the land of Israel.", ";1845: George Gawler publishes \"Tranquilization of Syria and the East: Observations and Practical Suggestions, in Furtherance of the Establishment of Jewish Colonies in Palestine, the Most Sober and Sensible Remedy for the Miseries of Asiatic Turkey.\"", ";1849: George Gawler accompanies Sir Moses Montefiori on a trip to Palestine, persuading him to invest in and initiate Jewish settlements in the country.", ";1852: George Gawler founds the Association for Promoting Jewish Settlement in Palestine"]}, {"page": "George Grey", "response": ["Grey was born in Lisbon, Portugal, just a few days after his father, Lieutenant-Colonel George Grey was killed at the Battle of Badajoz in Spain.

William Williams and James Cronk were the first settlers to gain a working knowledge of the language, and to publish a Kaurna wordlist, which they did in 1840. When George Gawler, South Australia's third Governor, arrived in October 1838, he gave a speech to the local Indigenous population through a translator, William Wyatt (later third interim Protector of Aborigines), assisted by Williams and Cronk.

Its collections were created by donations initially from Dr Forrester who had been a President of Derby Philosophical Society. The patron of the Museum Society was William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, and the President was Sir George Crewe who was a keen naturalist. Col. George Gawler contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor in South Australia. In 1839 a major exhibition was held at the Mechanics' Institute which contained many items including those from Joseph Strutt's collection. Many of these made their way into Derby Museum's collection. The society moved in 1840 to the Athenaeum in Victoria Street. The society's collections grew in 1856 and they were first offered for incorporation into the town by William Mundy, but the offer was rejected."]}, {"page": "Adelaide Gaol", "response": ["When Governor George Gawler arrived he was appalled at the conditions, saying that security was only being maintained by an \"expensive multiplicity of sentries\". London police sub-inspectors James Stuart and William Baker Ashton arrived in November 1838 to form the first police force, but found it had already been formed, in April 1838, under Henry Inman.

Although all the foundations had been laid the new plans halved the building work, which effectively reduced the contract cost to \u00a310,000 although this did not include the cost of work already completed. In October, Gawler again altered the plans by now including the gaoler's house he had earlier dropped from the original plans, added two more towers and increased the quality of the stonework by specifying ashlar which cost fifty percent more than the wrought stone specified in the original contract. These new alterations added \u00a39,000 to the cost. By March 1841 the goal was nearing completion, the builders Borrow and Goodiar had already received \u00a3l0,950 and they now requested a further \u00a38,733 which Gawler refused. The dispute resulted in the claim being arbitrated in court and the arbitrators requested an independent valuation of the work completed."]}, {"page": "Belair, South Australia", "response": ["The first known European settler in Belair was a squatter named Nicholas Foott.
