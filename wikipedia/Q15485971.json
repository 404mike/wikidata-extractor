He attended Grange Road School, where his father taught geography, and he discovered his love of music from singing in chapel choirs. In 1929 he won the George Calder MacLeod Scholarship to read history at Wadham College, Oxford, graduating in 1932 and winning the Osgood Memorial prize for his dissertation on John Blow, after which he studied at the Royal College of Music for a year.  It was here that he was encouraged to combine his loves of history and music.\nHe held a teaching post in London and was music organizer to Hertfordshire County Council for three years from 1946 and a lecturer at Worcester College of Education from 1949 until retirement in 1970.\nThese positions, while \"less than satisfying to his scholarly temperament\" at least allowed him sufficient time to pursue his independent work as a musical writer and editor, a work in which he was proud to have supported himself without recourse to grants or bursaries.\nIn 1948, E. H. Fellowes retired as honorary librarian of Sir Frederick Ouseley\u2019s choral foundation of St. Michael's College, Tenbury.  Shaw was his successor and also served as a Governor and Fellow. When the college closed in 1985 Shaw negotiated through Ouseley\u2019s two conflicting wills to ensure that all the manuscripts in this important collection reached the Bodleian Library - including Handel\u2019s conducting score of Messiah, used by the composer for the first performance in Dublin in 1742 - and also influenced the Charity Commissioners to ensure that the endowment now known as the Ouseley Trust should be made available \"for the purpose of promoting and maintaining to a high standard the choral services of the Church of England\".\nShaw was particularly known for his extensive writings on and editing of church music, a field in which he was active for nearly 50 years.  Much of his work was published under the auspices of the Church Music Society, of which he was the first honorary general editor (for 14 years from 1956), chairman from 1979 to 1987.  He was also closely associated with the Three Choirs Festival, often writing its programmes, and publishing its history in 1954.\nHis interests and publications focused on what is now termed early music, in Shaw's case roughly from Thomas Tallis to Samuel Sebastian Wesley, with major interests being John Blow, Henry Purcell and George Frideric Handel.  He also reconstructed and reinstated preces and responses by William Byrd, Thomas Morley, William Smith and Thomas Tomkins.  His scholarship in these centuries coincided with and helped lay the foundations on which the early music revival of the late 20th Century was built.\nHonours included a DLitt awarded in 1967 by the faculty of music at Oxford University and the OBE awarded in 1990 for services to music.\nPublished works included:\n\nMusic in the Primary School (London, 1952)\nThe Three Choirs Festival c1713-1953 (Worcester and London, 1954)\nMusic in the Secondary School (London, 1961)\nThe Story of Handel's 'Messiah', 1741-1784 (London, 1963)\nA Textual and Historical Companion to Handel's 'Messiah' (London, 1965)\nA Study of the Bing-Gostling Part Books in the Library of York Minster together with a Systematic Catalogue (Croydon, 1986)\nThe Succession of Organists of the Chapel Royal and the Cathedrals of England and Wales from c.1538 (Oxford, 1991).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Messiah (Handel)", "response": ["Charles Jennens was born around 1700, into a prosperous landowning family whose lands and properties in Warwickshire and Leicestershire he eventually inherited. His religious and political views\u2014he opposed the Act of Settlement of 1701 which secured the accession to the British throne for the House of Hanover\u2014prevented him from receiving his degree from Balliol College, Oxford, or from pursuing any form of public career. His family's wealth enabled him to live a life of leisure while devoting himself to his literary and musical interests.Burrows (1991), pp. 9\u201310 Although musicologist Watkins Shaw dismisses Jennens as \"a conceited figure of no special ability\", Donald Burrows has written:  \"of Jennens's musical literacy there can be no doubt\". He was certainly devoted to Handel's music, having helped to finance the publication of every Handel score since Rodelinda in 1725.(subscription) By 1741, after their collaboration on Saul, a warm friendship had developed between the two, and Handel was a frequent visitor to the Jennens family estate at Gopsall.", "The cause of authentic performance was advanced in 1965 by the publication of a new edition of the score, edited by Watkins Shaw. In the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, David Scott writes, \"the edition at first aroused suspicion on account of its attempts in several directions to break the crust of convention surrounding the work in the British Isles.\"  By the time of Shaw's death in 1996, The Times described his edition as \"now in universal use\".", "The numbering of the movements shown here is in accordance with the Novello vocal score (1959), edited by Watkins Shaw, which adapts the numbering earlier devised by Ebenezer Prout. Other editions count the movements slightly differently; the B\u00e4renreiter edition of 1965, for example, does not number all the recitatives and runs from 1 to 47.Burrows (1991), pp. ix and 86\u2013100 The division into parts and scenes is based upon the 1743 word-book prepared for the first London performance.Burrows (1991), pp. 83\u201384 The scene headings are given as Burrows summarized the scene headings by Jennens.", "* The Novello Edition, edited by Watkins Shaw, first published as a vocal score in 1959, revised and issued 1965.

He was one of the editors of Tudor Church Music, ten volumes published by Oxford University Press in the 1920s with the support of the Carnegie UK Trust. His work covered not only the music, but important biographical and critical writing such as The English Madrigal Composers, published in 1921 and William Byrd, published in 1936. Fellowes was honorary librarian of St. Michael's College, Tenbury from 1918 until 1948, and during this time he arranged and catalogued the musical library of Sir Frederick Ouseley.  He was succeeded in this post by Watkins Shaw."]}, {"page": "Charles Jennens", "response": ["The most famous collaboration is Jennens' libretto for Messiah, drawn entirely from the Bible, about 60 per cent from the Old Testament (with occasional small alterations). Musicologist Watkins Shaw describes it as \"a meditation of our Lord as Messiah in Christian thought and belief\", and which \"amounts to little short of a work of genius\". Some attribute Messiah's emphasis on the Old Testament \u2013 and choice of the Old Testament title \"Messiah\" \u2013 to Jennens' theological beliefs. Jennens was less than wholly approving of the musical setting, writing to Edward Holdsworth: \"I shall show you a collection I gave Handel, called Messiah, which I value highly. He has made a fine entertainment of it, though not near so good as he might and ought to have done. I have with great difficulty made him correct some of the grossest faults in the composition; but he retained his overture obstinately, in which there are some passages far unworthy of Handel, but much more unworthy of the Messiah.\""]}, {"page": "Shaw (name)", "response": ["*Watkins Shaw (1911\u20131996), British musicologist"]}, {"page": "Harold Watkins Shaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Watkins Shaw"]}, {"page": "Harold W.
