Harold Bloom, William Safire, and Philip Hensher have all regarded Rowling's prose as poor and her plots as conventional. According to A. S. Byatt, Harry Potter is a simplistic work that reflects a dumbed-down culture dominated by soap operas and reality television. Jack Zipes notes that earlier novels in the series have the same general plot. Harry begins the book with the Dursleys and escapes to begin his year at Hogwarts. There, he confronts a challenge related to Lord Voldemort, his nemesis. He succeeds by the end of the book and heads back to the Dursleys' house. According to Zipes, this repetition is \"tedious and grating\". These critics argue that the Harry Potter books do not innovate on established literary forms, either in their language or narrative, or challenge readers' preconceived ideas. Philip Nel rejects these criticisms as \"snobbery\" that reacts mainly to the novels' popularity, whereas Mary Pharr argues that Harry Potter conventionalism is the point: by amalgamating pre-existing literary forms familiar to her readers, Rowling invites them to \"ponder their own ideas\". While acknowledging that the overarching narrative and themes in Harry Potter are not original, Julia Eccleshare suggests that Rowling's deft plot development and storytelling make the books compelling."]}, {"page": "Rosemary Sutcliff", "response": ["* \"Obituary: Rosemary Sutcliff\", Julia Eccleshare, The Independent, 27 July 1992"]}, {"page": "Skellig", "response": ["Hodder published Almond's 300-page prequel to Skellig late in 2010, My Name is Mina ().
