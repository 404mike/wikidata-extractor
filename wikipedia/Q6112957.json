He sang lead vocals on \"Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\" on the album, I Robot (1977), and the (falsetto-like) single \"Pyramania\" taken from the Grammy nominated Pyramid (1978). Capable of singing in both high and low registers, Harris also sang backing vocals on the band's debut release Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976), including the deep voice alongside John Miles on their debut single \"(The System of) Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether\", as well as the choir-like voice behind Arthur Brown on \"The Tell-Tale Heart\".\nHe was previously signed to Decca Records as a solo artist. A regular collaborator of Ian Bairnson, his single \"Sail Away\", released in 1975, was produced by Alan Parsons and featured all the members of Pilot. He later appeared on Pilot's \"Ten Feet Tall\" from their final album Two's A Crowd (1977). Later that year \"Sail Away\" was re-released.He is a first cousin of Ron \"Chopper\" Harris.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Alan Parsons Project", "response": ["* Jack Harris \u2013 vocals (1976\u20131978)"]}, {"page": "Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)", "response": ["*Jack Harris \u2013 additional vocals "]}, {"page": "I Robot (album)", "response": ["*Lenny Zakatek, Allan Clarke, Steve Harley, Jack Harris, Peter Straker, Jaki Whitren, Dave Townsend, the English Chorale, the New Philharmonia Chorus \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)", "response": ["*Dean Ford, Colin Blunstone, Lenny Zakatek, John Miles, Jack Harris \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Victor Silvester", "response": ["Silvester's record sales were so high that competition was inevitable. Other dancers were attracted to the idea, and set up their own strict-tempo bands. Henry Jacques, Maxwell Stewart, Josephine Bradley and Wally Fryer were all top-flight dancers who set up in competition to Silvester. There were other bands led by musicians who were capable of recording in strict time. The best for ballroom competitions was probably Joe Loss, who had an even longer musical career than Silvester. Other bands that catered to ballroom dancing were Oscar Rabin and Jack Harris, whose band played in clubs and restaurants through the 1930s, Phil Tate, and Jack Parnell. For the post-war period of Latin dances to (mostly) Cuban and Brazilian rhythms, Edmundo Ros was in a class of his own."]}, {"page": "David Paton", "response": ["* 1975: Sail Away / Never Seen the Like - Jack Harris - Single - Also sang with The Alan Parsons Project."]}, {"page": "Hugo Rignold", "response": ["In the 1920s and 1930s, Rignold played violin with many jazz and dance bands of the day, including those of Mantovani, Jack Hylton, Jack Harris, Fred Hartley, Ambrose, Lew Stone and Jay Wilbur. Rignold was highly regarded as a jazz player.
