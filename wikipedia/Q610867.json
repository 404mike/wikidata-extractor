However, a January transfer window that culminated in the sales of important first team players Danny Fox and Scott Dann to Coventry City caused a drop in form throughout 2008.

Harding played against Derby County, but was barely used in the first team as Chris Cohen was preferred in the left-back position.

Faced with large losses, SISU had responded by selling many of the club's top stars such as Danny Fox and Scott Dann, while failing to agree new terms with out-of-contract players including Marlon King and goalkeeper Keiren Westwood. Failure to replace them, as well as the team's tendency to concede last-minute goals and suffer vital losses to other teams facing relegation, ultimately led to their finish in the bottom three. A consortium led by supporter Gary Hoffman attempted to buy the club but despite the club's losses and their unpopularity with supporters SISU refused to sell, perhaps because they hoped to acquire ownership of the stadium in future. In April 2012, SISU defaulted on the rent owed to ACL, setting in motion a multi-year battle between the club and the stadium's owners. The club claimed that the annual rent of \u00a31.2million was too high for them, and would not be sustainable given their imminent drop to League One."]}, {"page": "Brian Easton (footballer)", "response": ["On returning to Burnley, Easton said he vowed to become a regular player next season, with the club relegated back to the Championship.
