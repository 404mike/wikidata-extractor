Angel was born in Chelsea, London, England. He is the son of a London-based jazz musician, and the elder brother of rapper Monie Love.  He had an unorthodox musical education; his father influenced him deeply, as did his friends and his environment, including the radio.

This led to increased sophistication in the use of both rhythm and harmony in a number of techno productions.Sicko 1999:198 Manchester (UK)-based techno act 808 State helped fuel this development with tracks such as \"Pacific State\"Gerald Simpson (A Guy Called Gerald) maintains that \"Pacific State\" was intended for a John Peel session exclusively, but 808 State's Graham Massey and Martin Price added additional elements by drawing upon Massey's collection of exotic jazz records for inspiration. This led to the inclusion of a distinctive saxophone solo. Massey recalls that: We were trying to do something in the vein of Marshall Jefferson's 'Open Your Eyes'...That track was happening everywhere. The production was released as a white label in May 1989 and later issued on the mini-album Quadrastate at the end of July that year, just as the second Summer of Love was flowering. Massey remembers taking the white label to Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, and Jon Da Silva, and notes that it rose through the ranks to become the last tune of the night.

Graham Massey has discussed the use of unusual meters in 808 State's music commenting online on June 18, 2004, that: I always thought Cobra Bora could have stood a chance. It was sometimes played at Hot Night at the Hacienda despite its funny time signature (the feel of the track was created by combining parts in 6/8 time with others in 4/4). Detroit producer Mike Banks was heavily influenced by jazz, as demonstrated on the influential Underground Resistance release Nation 2 Nation (1991).Kodwo 1998:127 By 1993, Detroit acts such as Model 500 and UR had made explicit references to the genre, with the tracks \"Jazz Is The Teacher\" (1993) and \"Hi-Tech Jazz\" (1993), the latter being part of a larger body of work and group called Galaxy 2 Galaxy, a self-described jazz project based on Kraftwerk's \"man machine\" doctrine. \"Galaxy 2 Galaxy is a band that was conceptualized with the first hitech Jazz record produced by UR in 1986/87 and later released in 1990 which was Nation 2 Nation (UR-005). Jeff Mills and Mike Banks had visions of Jazz music and musicians operating on the same \"man machine\" doctrine dropped on them from Kraftwerk. Early experiments with synthesizers and jazz by artists like Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder, Weather Report, Return to Forever, Larry Heard and Lenny White's Astral Pirates also pointed them in this direction. UR went on to produce and further innovate this form of music which was coined 'Hitech Jazz' by fans after the historic 1993 release of UR's Galaxy 2 Galaxy (UR-025) album which included the underground UR smash titled 'Hitech Jazz'.\" This lead was followed by a number of techno producers in the UK who were influenced by both jazz and UR, Dave Angel's \"Seas of Tranquility\" EP (1994) being a case in point,Angelic Upstart : Mixmag interview with Dave Angel detailing his interest in jazz.
