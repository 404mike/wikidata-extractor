However, with much persuasion by the producers and writers, they, along with the rest of the cast, agreed to do a fifth and final series showing the Bellamy family and staff entering the decade of the twenties and ending the series with the start of the Great Depression. During the final series, Marsh and Williams reduced their appearances on the show, both appearing in only 11 instalments out of the sixteen episodes produced. In addition, eight new cast members were added to the series, which included two servants, Frederick and Lily, played by Gareth Hunt and Karen Dotrice; Richard Bellamy's new wife, Virginia (played by Hannah Gordon); Virginia's two children Alice and William (Anne Yarker and Jonathan Seely); Shirley Cain as Miss Treadwell, the children's governess; Madeleine Cannon as Lady Dorothy (Dolly) Hale, Georgina's self-centred, catty, fair weather friend; and Anthony Andrews as Lord Robert Stockbridge, Georgina's fianc\u00e9 and husband."]}, {"page": "Villain (1971 film)", "response": ["* Shirley Cain as Mrs Matthews"]}, {"page": "Pride and Prejudice (1980 TV series)", "response": ["* Shirley Cain as Mrs. Phillips"]}, {"page": "Laugh a Little Louder Please", "response": ["*Shirley Cain - Miss Treadwell"]}, {"page": "Wanted \u2013 A Good Home", "response": ["*Shirley Cain - Miss Treadwell"]}, {"page": "Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast", "response": ["*Shirley Cain - Nurse"]}, {"page": "Dombey and Son (1983 TV series)", "response": ["*Shirley Cain - Miss Tox"]}, {"page": "Shirley (name)", "response": ["*Shirley Cain (born 1935), British actress"]}, {"page": "The Pickwick Papers (TV series)", "response": ["*Shirley Cain \u2013 Miss Witherfield"]}, {"page": "List of LGBT-related films of 1971", "response": ["|Villain ||  || United Kingdom || Crime, thriller || Richard Burton, Ian McShane, Nigel Davenport, Fiona Lewis, Joss Ackland, T.
