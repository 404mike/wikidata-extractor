In 1920, he joined Cardiff City for their first season in the Football League and, after beginning the season as second choice behind Herbert Kneeshaw, he eventually made his debut on 22 January 1921 in a 1\u20130 victory over Bristol City. He retained his place for the rest of the 1920\u201321 season, conceding 12 goals in his 19 league appearances as Cardiff won promotion to the First Division. Davies was later forced out of the side by the arrival of Tom Farquharson during the 1922\u201323 season and moved to Second Division side Leicester City. Davies made his debut for the Foxes on 8 December 1923 in a 2\u20131 victory over South Shields, becoming the second oldest debutant in the club's history at the time behind Chris Duffy,  and made two further appearances in the same month. He later joined Bradford Park Avenue but did not make an appearance for the side."]}]}}
