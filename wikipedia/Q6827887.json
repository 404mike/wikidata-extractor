He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. Henderson played first-class and List A cricket for Durham in 1992. He was born in Stockton-on-Tees.\nHenderson had in fact started playing for Durham in 1991, but as the team had not entered the County Championship at this point, the games were all part of the Minor Counties Championship.\nFollowing his departure from the first team at the end of the 1992 season, in which Durham finished bottom of the table with just two wins from 22 games, Henderson played two further seasons of Second XI cricket. Henderson was an upper-middle order batsman and an occasional bowler for the Durham team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Henderson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Paul Henderson (born 1943) is a Canadian former ice hockey player and member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.", "Paul Henderson may also refer to:", "*Paul Henderson (sprinter) (born 1971), Australian sprinter", "*Paul Henderson (cricketer) (born 1974), English cricketer", "*Paul Henderson (soccer) (born 1976), Australian football goalkeeper", "*Paul Henderson (journalist) (1939\u20132018), winner of the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting", "*Paul Henderson (photojournalist) (1899\u20131988), African-American photojournalist for the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper", "*Paul Henderson (politician) (born 1962), former Chief Minister of the Australian Northern Territory", "*Paul Henderson (rugby union) (born 1964), New Zealand rugby union player", "*Paul Henderson (sailor) (born 1934), Canadian sailor and member of the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame", "*Paul Henderson (basketball) (born 1956), \\American-French professional basketball player", "*Paul Henderson, lead vocalist for the 1980s Canadian band The Front"]}, {"page": "Henderson (surname)", "response": ["*Paul Henderson (disambiguation), one of several people including:", "**Paul Henderson (born 1943), Canadian ice hockey player", "**Paul Henderson (cricketer), English cricketer", "**Paul Henderson (footballer) (born 1976), Australian football goalkeeper", "**Paul Henderson (journalist) (1939\u20132018), American journalist and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1982", "**Paul Henderson (rugby union) (born 1964), New Zealand rugby union player"]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Paul Henderson (1991\u20131992) : P.
