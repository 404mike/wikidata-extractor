He is the Richard Titmuss Professor of Social Policy at the London School of Economics (LSE) and was a senior policy advisor to former Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLe Grand is the author, co-author or editor of seventeen books and over ninety articles on economics, philosophy and public policy. One of his books, Motivation, Agency and Public Policy: Of Knights and Knaves, Pawns and Queens, was described by The Economist as \"accessible \u2013 and profound\" and by The Times as \"one of the most important books on public policy in recent years\".  He was one of Prospect magazine's 100 top British public intellectuals, and one of the ESRC's ten Heroes of Dissemination.He is one of the principal architects of the UK Government's current \u2018quasi-market\u2019 reforms introducing choice and competition into health care and education. In addition, he originated and developed several innovative ideas in social policy, including one that became the \u2018baby bond\u2019 or Child Trust Fund, the Partnership Scheme for funding long term care endorsed by the 2005 Wanless Report Securing Good Care for Older People, the Educational Premium for the less well off and for looked after children, and the Social Care Practice in the 2006 Department for Education and Skills Green Paper, Care Matters.\nLe Grand was one of the signatories of a letter published in The Guardian on 15 April 2008, which criticised the UK Government's \"retreat in the face of a rightwing challenge over inheritance tax\". Le Grand and his co-authors argued that inheritance tax \"is one of the few tools which directly reduces inherited inequalities.\"In 2014 he was a member of the Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care in England for the King's Fund, chaired by Kate Barker which delivered its final report in September.  He subsequently denounced the proposal of increasing NHS charges, which he described as a zombie idea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 29", "response": ["*  1945   \u2013 Julian Le Grand, English economist and author"]}, {"page": "Equity (economics)", "response": ["* Julian Le Grand (1991).

Subsequently the related concept of Individual Development Accounts was developed in the United States by Michael Sherraden.Washington University in St Louis, Michael Sherraden  This approach - termed \"asset-based welfare\" by Sherraden - saw asset redistribution less as an egalitarian measure than as one which supported poverty reduction by encouraging saving.

As to the latter, Paul Samuelson (1947),Paul A. Samuelson, 1947. Foundations of Economic Analysis, ch. VIII (\"Welfare Economics\"), p. 221. expanding on work of Abram Bergson, represents a social welfare function in general terms as any ethical belief system required to order any (hypothetically feasible) social states for the entire society as \"better than\", \"worse than\", or \"indifferent to\" each other.
