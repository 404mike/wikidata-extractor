Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" (1980) and \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982). After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding, and guitarist Dave Gregory.  A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking (1986), Oranges & Lemons (1989), and Nonsuch (1992). In the US, \"Mayor of Simpleton\" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while \"Dear God\" (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.", "Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding grew up on Penhill council estate in Swindon. Partridge jokingly characterised the community as being populated almost entirely by people with physical, mental or emotional defects. In the 1960s, he was a fan of contemporary pop groups like the Beatles, but was intimidated by the process of learning guitar. When the Monkees grew popular, he became interested in joining a music group. He recalled watching local guitarist Dave Gregory performing Jimi Hendrix-style songs at churches and youth clubs: \"Sort of acid-skiffle. I thought, 'Ah, one day I'll play guitar!' But I didn't think I would be in the same band as this kid on the stage.\" Partridge eventually obtained a guitar and taught himself how to play it with no formal training. At the age of 15, he wrote his first song, titled \"Please Help Me\", and attracted the nickname \"Rocky\" for his early guitar mastery of the Beatles' \"Rocky Raccoon\" (1968). By the early 1970s, his music tastes had transitioned \"from the Monkees to having a big binge on this Euro-avant-garde stuff. I got really in deep.\" One of his first bands was called \"Stiff Beach\", formed in August 1970. In early 1972, Partridge's constantly evolving group settled into \"Star Park\", a four-piece that featured himself with guitarist Dave Cartner, drummer Paul Wilson, and a bassist nicknamed \"Nervous Steve\".", "Rather than hiring a replacement keyboardist, Dave Gregory of the covers band Dean Gabber and His Gaberdines was invited to join as a second guitarist. Partridge remembered holding a \"pretend audition\" where Gregory was asked to play \"This Is Pop\", only for Gregory to inquire whether they wanted the album version or the single version: \"We thought, 'Bloody oh, a real musician.' But he was in the band before he even knew.\" Gregory was anxious of whether the fans would accept him as a member, characterizing himself as \"the archetypal pub-rocker in jeans and long hair. But the fans weren't bothered. Nobody was fashionable in XTC, ever.\" He grew more comfortable with the group after playing a few shows, he said, \"and things got better and better\".", "Barry Andrews, XTC's keyboard player for their first two albums, emerged as a third solo songwriter on the group's second album Go 2. However, he left the band shortly thereafter. His replacement, guitarist Dave Gregory, did not contribute songs, but was the only one in the band who could score music, and frequently contributed orchestral arrangements. Moulding said that when Andrews was in the band, Partridge had \"no kind of foil\" to work with, as both musicians were drawn to dissonant harmonies: \"[Andy] used to like the real kind of angular, spiky, upward-thrusting guitar ... if one is angular, the other has to kind of straighten him out ... So when Dave came in, and was a much straighter player, it seemed to make more sense, I think.\" Starting in 1982, Gregory extended his talents to keyboards as well, since Partridge and Moulding were not adept with the instrument.", "The Beach Boys' 1968 rendition of \"Bluebirds Over the Mountain\" was one of the first records Partridge bought with his own money. Although it is widely assumed that the Beach Boys influenced XTC throughout their career, Partridge stated that he was originally only familiar with singles such as \"I Get Around\" (1964) and \"Good Vibrations\" (1967) which were an enormous influence for him. It was not until 1986 that he discovered that the Beach Boys had an album career, when he first heard Smiley Smile (1967) in its entirety. Moulding credited the arrival of Dave Gregory with reviving Partridge's interest in 1960s bands like the Kinks. However, Partridge similarly only knew of the Kinks through the group's 1960s singles, and did not listen to any of their albums until the late 1980s. Partridge also claimed that \"the Beatles were the farthest thing from my mind\" until 1982; at another time he stated that the opening F chord on XTC's 1978 single \"This Is Pop\" was directly based on the opening chord from the Beatles' \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964).", "XTC were one of the progenitors of Britpop, were influential to later power pop acts such as Jellyfish and the Apples in Stereo, and anticipated the indie/art pop bands of the 2000s.  They also inspired tribute bands, tribute albums, fan conventions, and fansites. Dave Gregory said that he became aware of XTC's \"huge\" influence on American acts through his interactions with musicians in the late 1980s. XTC also had a significant influence and cult following in Japan. By the late 1980s, they were supported by three dedicated fanzines in as many countries. Between 1979 and 1992, they had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40.", "* Dave Gregory \u2013 guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1979\u20131998)", "  bar:Dave       text:Dave Gregory"]}, {"page": "Peter Gabriel", "response": ["Gabriel has worked with a relatively stable crew of musicians and recording engineers throughout his solo career.

Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when growing up in the 1970s, and thought it would be an interesting addition to the group's sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for \u00a3165, and first used it on the album Mummer (1983).

All these albums were conceived and realised with the help of long-time collaborator, pianist and double-bassist Danny Manners.

At the suggestion of A&R executive Jeremy Lascelles, young American producer Paul Fox was recruited based on the strength of a Boy George remix that the label commissioned of him. Partridge disliked the original track but enjoyed Fox's remix: \"It was really shiny, powerful and impressive.\" Fox subsequently flew to England and met Partridge at his home: \"He was obviously a huge fan of the band and was willing to translate what we wanted onto tape.\" He offered them a cheap studio rate in Los Angeles, which the band accepted. Another reason for recording in the US with an American producer, guitarist Dave Gregory said, was that the US had become \"our biggest market\". XTC, accompanied by the Moulding and Partridge families, arrived in Los Angeles on 12 May and stayed at the Oakwood Apartments in north Hollywood. The families returned home after two months; Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding then shared an apartment for the remainder of their stay.", "Dave Gregory, in his words, took credit for \"quite a lot [of] the arrangements and the overdubs\". He was frustrated that his suggestions to Fox were almost always deferred to \"the songwriter\", which meant either Partridge or Moulding. Both Gregory and Moulding characterised Fox as subservient to Partridge's studio indulgences, which they termed \"Andy-ness\", and felt that it had a negative effect on the album's sound. Guests who visited the sessions included Elvis Costello, who was next door recording his album Spike (1989), KROQ disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer, Chris Squire of Yes, David Byrne of Talking Heads and actor River Phoenix. Partridge has said that Phoenix was an \"utter and anal\" fan of the band, and urged him to phone a friend who was \"also a big fan\", Keanu Reeves.", "\"Scarecrow People\", built on a \"horsey\" rhythm, is cited by Partridge as his favourite on the record. It was written as an outlet for his longtime fascination with the word \"straw\". The lyrics are about mankind's value of \"trash above worthwhile things. ... We're still shaped like human beings, but there's no thought process going on.\" He could not identify what key it is in and noted that the opening guitar chord (D-E-B-E or C) contains none of the notes of the melody. According to music writer Geoffrey Himes, the song \"recalls the music-hall feel and 'Babbitt' theme\" of the Beatles' \"Nowhere Man\" (1965). Partridge felt there was a resemblance to Prince's \"Sign o' the Times\" (1987), \"It's very kind of cartoon Blues ...  then the chorus is kind of when it gets more conventional corny Country. It could be Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison or something.\" He credited the cascading 16th-notes \u2013 played on guitar by Dave Gregory and heard in the stereo right channel \u2013 as the song's centerpiece.

It was the last album to include guitarist Dave Gregory, who departed XTC while in the middle of the sessions due to frustrations with Partridge. By the time of its release, Partridge no longer viewed XTC as a band, and preferred it to be known as a \"brand\" covering his and bassist Colin Moulding's music.", "Moulding, Bendall and guitarist Dave Gregory wanted to reduce the project to one disc, but Partridge insisted on spreading it over two LPs. It was decided that they release one album with the orchestral portions (\"volume 1\") and leave the rock songs for its follow-up (\"volume 2\"). Preliminary \"programming sessions\" were conducted at Bendall's home in late 1997. The group then commenced recording at Chris Difford's home studio in Sussex, but the sessions fell apart after two weeks.

Sessions began in March 1984. As was the case for Mummer, the Glitter Band's Pete Phipps was hired as a session drummer for the band, and the group continued making more use of exotic instrumentation, such as the Mellotron they had purchased for that album. Other keyboard instruments included a Prophet-5, a Yamaha CP-80, and a Roland JX-3P owned by guitarist Dave Gregory. Some of The Big Express was recorded using a Linn LM-1 Drum Computer and extensive time was spent on its programming. Moulding played a Wal bass that was one of the first guitars built with an active circuit, a component which boosts treble at the cost of bass, which was popular among 1980s musicians. He used the bass on about four tracks and said that it provided a \"middley, borpy sound I was after.\" Tears for Fears, who were recording Songs from the Big Chair (1985) at a nearby studio in the area, loaned the group an E-mu Emulator.

And then when the drums come in, or the band comes in, it throws you completely.\" To write the song, Moulding started with a three-note piano figure, which he then overdubbed with two guitar riffs: \"The track didn't really happen until David Lord got hold of it.

An album of songs in that style was immediately put to consideration, but the group could not go through with it due to their commercial obligations to Virgin Records. Another consideration Partridge had was the punk movement's antipathy toward pop music of the past. XTC stopped touring in 1982 and immediately began focusing on refining their sound in the studio. During the making of their 1984 album The Big Express, Partridge began writing material he thought could potentially be performed in a psychedelic style, the first being \"Your Gold Dress\". He recalled \"beginning [to be unable] to contain the desire to do this. You can see it leaking out earlier\".", "Leckie agreed to take on production and searched for a cheap studio for the band. Partridge invited his XTC bandmates to participate; they were augmented on drums by Dave Gregory's brother Ian, since the group did not have a drummer at the time. The song \"25 O'Clock\" was quickly written as they waited for the project to be greenlit by Virgin. After the label reluctantly loaned the group \u00a35,000, two weeks were spent on the album's recording and mixing at Chapel Lane Studios in Hereford, England. The project was planned as a full-length LP, but only six songs were completed due to time constraints.

The band dressed themselves in Paisley outfits for the sessions and lit scented candles. Partridge: \"Dave Gregory took to the Dukes a bit too much. Elephant jumbo cord flares, big white belt, beads - we were a bit worried.\" In contrast to himself and Gregory, \"Colin was more of a heavy metal kid.
