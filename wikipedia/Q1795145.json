He is one of the pioneers of fetal medicine and his discoveries have revolutionised the field. He was elected to the US National Academy of Medicine in 2020 for 'improving the care of pregnant women worldwide with pioneering rigorous and creative approaches, and making seminal contributions to prenatal diagnosis and every major obstetrical disorder'. This is considered to be one of the highest honours in the fields of health and medicine and recognises individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Greek Cypriots", "response": ["* Kypros Nicolaides, Professor in Fetal Medicine at King's College Hospital, London"]}, {"page": "List of Cypriots", "response": ["* Kypros Nicolaides (born 1953), obstetrician"]}, {"page": "The English School, Nicosia", "response": ["*Kypros Nicolaides, pioneer in fetal medicine"]}, {"page": "Stuart Campbell (obstetrician)", "response": ["He went on to work at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, before being appointed Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King's College Hospital, where he established a fetal medicine unit of international renown (now Harris-Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine), where other leading fetal medicine practitioners such as Kypros Nicolaides, and Charles Rodeck would later train and work."]}, {"page": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "response": ["It sold its assisted conception unit to the Fetal Medicine Foundation and a company called King's Fertility for a total of \u00a326\u00a0million in June 2017.

Stevenson in the field of image analysis since her D.Phil. and they have multiple publications together, notably in 3D power Doppler ultrasound (3D-PD US) methodology and application to placental imaging. Her work with Kypros Nicolaides of the Fetal Medicine Foundation led to the development of the original fully convolutional neural network (OxNNet) which can automatically segment the placenta from a 3D ultrasound volume. Collins and her team have developed several fully automated tools (OxNNet Toolkit) for assessment of first trimester placental morphology and vascularity with the ultimate aim of developing a multifactorial risk prediction model for fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia later in pregnancy. The work of Collins, Stevenson and Alec (William) Welsh on power Doppler (PD) ultrasound has led to the development of the first standardised technique for quantitative estimation of perfusion in 3D which has now been validated in an animal model."]}]}}
