In 1799 fellow-student Henry Brougham persuaded him to study the diffraction of light. The results of his investigations were communicated from time to time in papers to the Philosophical Transactions of London and other scientific journals. The fact that other scientists \u2013 notably \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus and Augustin Fresnel \u2013 were pursuing the same investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate Brewster's claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the priority must be assigned to others.

He read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises extensively. This rubbed off on the young David, who became an avid reader, but he also loved scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David's deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between religion and science. In 1832, he read Philosophy of a Future State, written by Thomas Dick, and he found the rationale that he needed to reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence."]}, {"page": "John Muir", "response": ["Williams notes that Muir's philosophy and world view rotated around his perceived dichotomy between civilization and nature. From this developed his core belief that \"wild is superior\". His nature writings became a \"synthesis of natural theology\" with scripture that helped him understand the origins of the natural world. According to Williams, philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Dick suggested that the \"best place to discover the true attributes of deity was in Nature\". He came to believe that God was always active in the creation of life and thereby kept the natural order of the world. As a result, Muir \"styled himself as a John the Baptist\", adds Williams, \"whose duty was to immerse in 'mountain baptism' everyone he could\". Williams concludes that Muir saw nature as a great teacher, \"revealing the mind of God\", and this belief became the central theme of his later journeys and the \"subtext\" of his nature writing."]}, {"page": "Broughty Ferry", "response": ["Sportspeople that have associations with Broughty Ferry include international footballers Frank Munro and Peter Lorimer and the former Scottish international rugby union captain Sir George Cunningham.
