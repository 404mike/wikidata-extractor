These rules meant that much more detail was required in the particulars of claim (the document that sets out the claimant's case), the procedure as a whole was streamlined further (no disclosure, no examination in chief of expert witness, tight control by the Judge of the issues that go to trial) and financial limits were introduced to both the damages (at \u00a3500,000) and the legal costs (at \u00a350,000, with an additional cap per stage) recoverable.

It was also reported that barristers for ACS:Law failed to provide vital documents due to them being \"in storage\".

In response, Judge Colin Birss said \"I am not happy. I am getting the impression with every twist and turn since I started looking at these cases that there is a desire to avoid any judicial scrutiny\". On 8 February 2011, Judge Birss told ACS:Law that the claims which had been brought to court could not be discontinued without the permission of the copyright holders, and a further hearing was set for 16 March. At this hearing the cases were officially closed.
