This band was the resident band at the New Prince's restaurant in Piccadilly.Memory Lane No. 45 \u2013 New Prince's article written by Vince Egan The band was made up of fellow Canadians and was directed by Hal Swain. It was when Hal Swain left the band, that at Alfie Noakes' behest, Art joined and took Hal Swain's place. The band was about to embark on a continental tour but first took some time fulfilling a recording contract again for Columbia. The publication British Dance Bands on RecordBritish Dance Bands on Record \u2013 by Brian Rust and Sandy Forbes shows Art playing tenor sax but he doubled on alto sax and trumpet. This band had recorded about 50 titles since November 1924, but just one more session took place on February 25, 1926, while Art was with them. The band actually left for the continent in August 1926 and by now consisted of Dave Caplan (banjo), Les Allen (clarinet, tenor sax), Ken Kenney (drums), Art Lousley (trumpet), Jack Collins (trombone), John Whittaker (bass), Laurie Day (piano) and of course Art Christmas who played mostly alto sax but doubled on tenor sax, clarinet, trombone and trumpet.(This likely started Art thinking of trying to make a name for himself as a multi instrumentalist even as early as the 1920s). Eventually this band became known as \"The Toronto Band from Canada, featuring Art Christmas\" and from about the first week in September they played at the Faun des Westens in Berlin. During November they also appeared at The Scala Theatre, assisting the dance pair Annette Mills and Bobby, who were demonstrating the Charleston dance. While in Berlin, Germany, the band recorded about 56 titles for Deutsche Grammophon/Polydor. This band had a very strong jazz component thanks mainly to Art Christmas' style. The German discographer Horst Lange compared it to the California Ramblers in his \"Jazz in Deutschland: die deutsche Jazz-Chronik\", noting that Art Christmas and other members of the band were familiar with all styles and could play with this special 'American feeling' which pure European musicians and bands were lacking. One of this band's few surviving recordings \"I'm Sitting On Top Of The World\", is a vigorous effort in the \"hot dance\" genre and according to the book 'The Lost History Of Jazz In Canada by Mark Miller',The Lost History of Jazz In Canada (Such Melodious Racket)- by Mark Miller \".......is distinguished by Art Christmas' alto saxophone solo.\" Horst Lange's book Discography Of German Dance MusicDiscography of German Dance Music \u2013 by Horst Lange shows the personnel of the band changing considerably, with only Art Christmas, Les Allen, Dave Caplan and Ken Kenney remaining from the band which left Britain. Art worked extensively in Britain and Europe during the late 1920s and led his own band in Budapest, Berlin and London. He was with the Savoy Orpheans for a brief time and then joined Billy Mason in 1930. Art played and recorded with Percival Mackey and Dave Frost during the latter half of 1931 and was now playing baritone sax as well as the other instruments with these groups."]}, {"page": "1955 in British television", "response": ["*2 January \u2013 Annette Mills who hosted Muffin the Mule makes her last appearance on television.", "*10 January \u2013 Annette Mills dies from a heart attack after an operation.
