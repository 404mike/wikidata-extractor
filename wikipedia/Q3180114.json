Mbu in Okundi, Western Nigeria. The hospital was built in 1998 in memory of his late father and uncle and called The Joedy Memorial Hospital. Originally built as a maternity hospital, it soon found itself treating everyone who came through its doors. It is now in great need of refurbishment as well as ongoing financial support to ensure that there is free medical treatment available for everyone in the surrounding area.
