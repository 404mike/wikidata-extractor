Educated in London and Oxford, he only took to natural history in his thirties, having worked as a teacher until then. Although an ordained Anglican priest, Stebbing promoted Darwinism in a number of popular works, and was banned from preaching as a result. His scientific works mostly concerned crustaceans, especially the Amphipoda and Isopoda, the most notable being his work on the amphipods of the Challenger expedition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1908: Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Stebbing (taxonomy)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Acanthonotozoma", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Bateidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Cressidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Ischyroceridae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Ochlesidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Liljeborgiidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Haustoriidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Melphidippidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing"]}, {"page": "Phliantidae", "response": ["Phliantidae was originally proposed by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing in 1899 for a group that also contained the genera currently placed in the family Prophliantidae, while Temnophlias has also been moved from Phliantidae to its own monotypic families.
