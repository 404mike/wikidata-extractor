House first charted in the UK in Wolverhampton following the success of the Northern Soul scene.

The founding members were Colin Angus, Derek McKenzie and Keith McKenzie. Peter Stephenson joined shortly after to take over on keyboards from Angus. Several other people were later in the band. Angus then teamed up with Will Sinnott, and together they found credibility as pioneers of rock/dance crossover. When Mr. C joined, the band moved on to international commercial success with \"Ebeneezer Goode\" and their 1992 Boss Drum album.", "\"Knature of a Girl\" was the first record by the Shamen to feature Sinnott, but it was not until June's \"Jesus Loves Amerika\" single that the techno influence began to show. By this stage, Angus and Sinnott had become hooked on the acid house movement taking place in London, and its music and clubs were to exert an influence on the pair. Keith McKenzie and Peter Stephenson were less impressed by these new developments, and left the group the following summer, after the January 1989 release of the In Gorbachev We Trust album, which saw the group further enhancing their sound. Over the summer of 1988, they met Mr. C and Evil Eddie Richards, who later both worked with the Shamen to help them transition their music into the rave scene.", "Their third album, En-Tact, was released in 1990, and it spawned the hit singles \"Move Any Mountain (Progen '91)\", \"Hyperreal\" and \"Make It Mine\". Also notable was the appearance of rapper, DJ and producer Mr. C, as well as incorporation of a female vocalist, Plavka Lonich \u2013 who was intended to become the focal point of the group. The transformation into a successful rave party act was complete. Tensions had already begun to show, however - the band's barely concealed espousal of the then-fashionable new psychedelic drugs and the artistic pressures of altering direction from that of an acceptably skilled guitar band to an electronic dance act. As they continued their Synergy tour, their popularity in the United Kingdom began to rapidly expand. \"Hyperreal\", released in March 1991, reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. By this time, they realised they were on their way to reaching mainstream popularity. Every Synergy Live show on the fifth and sixth leg of tours were sold out. On the sixth leg of Synergy in April 1991, Gavin Knight and Richard Sharpe joined as the live drummer and keyboardist for the Shamen respectively.", "With Mr. C now a full-time member of the Shamen, and Soul Family Sensation's  Jhelisa Anderson (who was chosen to replace Plavka, as she was already an One Little Indian artist) providing guest vocals, the Boss Drum album followed in 1992. Boss Drum featured a spoken-word collaboration, \"Re:Evolution\" with Terence McKenna, and the Shamen's biggest and most controversial hit: \"Ebeneezer Goode\". \"Ebeneezer Goode\" was accused of promoting drug use, owing to the refrain, 'Ezer Goode, Ezer Goode' as homophonic with 'E's are good' (E being slang for the drug ecstasy), 'He", "Mr. C has since continued as a house music DJ and became a nightclub owner of The End club.
