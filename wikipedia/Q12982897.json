Jameson played for Warwickshire County Cricket Club from 1960 until 1976.\nPrimarily a hard-hitting top-order batsman, Jameson was also a useful occasional offspin or medium-pace bowler. A capable slip fielder, he occasionally kept wicket. On one occasion, Jameson was a member of a Warwickshire team which boasted three international wicket-keepers, but he had to keep wicket nonetheless: Deryck Murray was injured, Rohan Kanhai had given up keeping, and A.C. Smith had been selected for his bowling.Cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, noted, \"Born into the era of Boycott, Edrich and Amiss, John Jameson had precious few opportunities to break into Test cricket. A brave, attacking opener who was at his best trying to hammer fast bowling out of the ground, he played a couple of Tests in 1971 but did not help his cause by being run out in three of his first four innings\". He is unique in being the only England cricketer to be run out in both innings of a Test match. In addition, he is the only Test cricketer ever to be similarly dismissed in three successive Test innings.Jameson was diagnosed as Diabetes mellitus type 2 in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["*    John Jameson"]}, {"page": "Rohan Kanhai", "response": ["In English county cricket for Warwickshire, he also played alongside Kallicharran, John Jameson, and Dennis Amiss.

The tourists declared on 297 for 9 in their first innings with fifties from Jarvis (84) and Vivian (54*), and reduced to Warwickshire to 64 four in reply. An unbeaten partnership of 255 three hours between John Jameson and Tom Cartwright, who scored 137 and 112 respectively allowed Warwickshire to declare on 319 for four. The New Zealanders were bowled out for 219 in their second innings with Reid playing another aggressive innings of 84. This left the home team a target of 198 in just over two-and-a-half hours, which they accomplished with one wicket down and 12 minutes to spare. Billy Ibadulla (93) and M. J. K. Smith (63) put on an unbroken stand of 132 to see Warwickshire home. The New Zealanders final county match of the tour resulted in a draw at Northampton with New Zealand having the better of the match. Northants declared on 282 for seven after rain cut short the first day, with the tourists reply totalling 370 for nine declared. Dick's 96 in 87 minutes was the highlight of the innings with Congdon and Morgan also reaching their fifties. Northants batted slowly on the final day to save the game, finishing on 188 for nine."]}, {"page": "1975 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["| John Jameson \u00a0(wk)"]}]}}
