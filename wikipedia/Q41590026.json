The number of judges was increased from three to four in 2011, with short story writers Heather Beck, John Burnside and Alison MacLeod joining Royle on the panel. While the main prize remained at \u00a310,000, and the competition was still open to anyone aged 16 or over, the Young Writer of the Year element was dropped as the rise in UK university tuition fees made it financially unfeasible to offer a bursary. The 2011 Prize received a record number of entries - almost 1,900 from over 45 countries - and the judges were so impressed with the overall quality that they asked to increase the short-list from six to eight, and to commend an additional 31 stories ; the international nature of the competition was reflected in the make-up of the short-list, with four finalists from the UK, three from the USA and one from Canada. The prize was awarded at a ceremony held once again as part of the Manchester Literature Festival, this time taking place at Chetham's School of Music in the centre of Manchester on the evening of Friday 14 October; Draper and Frost returned as hosts, this time working as a comical double-act. Head Judge Nicholas Royle spoke about the difficulty of choosing a winner and announced that the panel had decided to split the prize, awarding a first prize of \u00a37,500 to Krishan Coupland and a second prize of \u00a32,500 to Richard Hirst. The runners up were Nicole Cullen, Garret Freymann-Weyr, Silvia Moreno-Garcia, Alex Preston, Bethany Rogers and Judith Turner-Yamamoto.
