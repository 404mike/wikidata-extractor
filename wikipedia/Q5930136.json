The students were housed in hostels that were segregated based on the students' religious affiliation\u2014Roman Catholic or Anglican. According to the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (2008 to 2015), organized by the parties of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, the Churchill Vocational Centre in northern Manitoba, housed Inuit youth from Mittimatalik and about 16 other remote hamlets\u2014all at that time still part of the Northwest Territories\u2014Nunavut was created in 1999. Some of Churchill Vocational Centre students travelled \"staggering\" distances with some Inuit communities separated by as much as 2,200 kilometres. Over the years, the Churchill Vocational Centre had \"provided academic and vocational training to about 1,000 to 1,200 Inuit youth\". The September 2007 landmark compensation deal, the federal government-approved agreement amounted to nearly $2 billion in compensation to former students who had attended 130 schools. By 2008, different levels of government, including Tunnuniq MLA James Arvaluk and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, worked with some former Churchill residential school students,  as the school records had not been properly maintained, and many former students were not able to receive adequate and fair compensation. While at Churchill, the young Inuit met other young people from different regions and they discussed common problems and considered political change. www.publichistory.ca The new organizations they founded upon returning to the Arctic, included the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITK) in the eastern Arctic in 1971. It was the ITK that initiated the 1973 Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project (ILUOP).

This resulted in the opening of the Panarctic's Nanisivik coal mine which operated from 1976 until 2002. Researchers investigated the 1970-1976 planning process behind the Strathcona Sound mining project on the northern tip of Baffin Island. Panarctic's Nanisivik mine operated from 1976 until 2002. The 2013 article said that the federal government and the Inuit themselves had different ideas of \"what was good for them\". To the federal government, Inuit were perceived as \"labour in need of employment\" and Inuit resisted this definition. A September 1974 editorial in the Pond Inlet community newsletter, questioned \"Why has so little been told to the people of Pond Inlet concerning a mine that might affect their lives for the next thirteen years? Why have we not been informed of both sides of the picture?\" The people of the other north Baffin Island communities affected by the Strathcona Sound mining project had been almost entirely excluded from discussions about the project. When Department of Indian and Northern Affairs representatives arrived on a January/February tour to \"collect labour availability data\" they had shared very little about the project with local communities. In 1974, Pond Inlet hamlet had \"refused to deal with the DIAND representatives because of the inadequacy of the information provided.\" In his 1973 Arctic Institute of North America article, Eric Gourdeau, discussed the social impact that Panarctic's wages had on Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay\u2014Panarctic wages had \"more than doubled the cash income gained by the regular wage workers in each community.\" Gibson noted that Gourdeau's report has been severely criticized by Hugh Brody, who was strongly against \"recent trends\" that push \"native people increasingly towards the lowest and least certain rung on the national class ladder\" by separating him \"from his own means of production\", leaving him \"unable to have a sure relationship to the intruders' means of production.\" Brody was concerned that Inuit people would become migrant workers or casual labourers. He said that the \"problem will not be cleared away by promises of high pay at the golden frontier: short term booms that are so characteristic of frontier development only worsen the problems that will follow.\" Gourdeau was \"generally favourable to the rotation option for native employment in Arctic resource extraction\"."]}, {"page": "Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction", "response": ["* Hugh Brody, The Other Side of Eden: Hunters, Farmers and the Shaping of the World"]}, {"page": "University of the Fraser Valley", "response": ["* Hugh Brody - Canada Research Chair in Aboriginal Studies"]}, {"page": "Juliet Stevenson", "response": ["Stevenson has lived with her partner, British anthropologist Hugh Brody, since 1993.

The Committee for Original Peoples\u2019 Entitlement (COPE) was established in the western Arctic in response to exploratory oil seismic work on Banks Island in October, 1970 that threatened the subsistence of local trappers. In the eastern Arctic, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITK) was founded in 1971. In 1973, the ITK initiated the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project which used land use mapping or counter-mapping methodologies, resulting in a three volume publication, based on research by a team of experts working closely with Inuit across Canada. According to Milton Freeman who oversaw the project, it \"documented the total Inuit land use area of the Northwest Territories, then stretching from the Mackenzie River to east Baffin Island,\" to provide \"information in support of the fact that Inuit have used and occupied this vast northern land since time immemorial and that they still use and occupy it to this day.\" Hugh Brody worked on the project from 1976\u201378 as coordinator in the North Baffin region.

The current discourse of the Shrine is to build a community centre that would house the Shrine, or build a replica of the Shrine. Jonaitas explains, however, that there needs to be a more 'nuanced' view and understanding of how historical events occurring, both before and after the acquisition, has presented challenges as to how to repatriate in light of loss of ceremonial rituals and traditions surrounding the handling of such sacred items.
