He is best remembered for having produced one of the earliest maps of Mars in 1867 from 27 drawings by the English observer William Rutter Dawes. His map was later superseded by those of Giovanni Schiaparelli and Eug\u00e8ne Antoniadi and his nomenclature was dropped (for instance, his \"Kaiser Sea\" became Syrtis Major Planum).\nHe used old drawings of Mars dating back to 1666 to try to determine the sidereal day of Mars.  His final estimate, in 1873, was 24h 37m 22.713s, very close to the modern value of 24h 37m 22.663s.The crater Proctor on Mars is named after him.", "link_mentions": {}}}
