He is best remembered for having produced one of the earliest maps of Mars in 1867 from 27 drawings by the English observer William Rutter Dawes. His map was later superseded by those of Giovanni Schiaparelli and Eug\u00e8ne Antoniadi and his nomenclature was dropped (for instance, his \"Kaiser Sea\" became Syrtis Major Planum).\nHe used old drawings of Mars dating back to 1666 to try to determine the sidereal day of Mars.  His final estimate, in 1873, was 24h 37m 22.713s, very close to the modern value of 24h 37m 22.663s.The crater Proctor on Mars is named after him.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Sparrow Smythe", "response": ["Carlotta Patti toured in the beginning of 1880 under Smythe and during that year Smythe's preference turned from substantial musical companies to more serious platform speakers such as the \"lamented Richard Anthony Proctor astronomer\" then war correspondent Archibald Forbes in 1882 (with whom he first met Mark Twain while in America). Moncure Daniel Conway followed in 1883, then George Augustus Sala whom had earlier written to Smythe after hearing how much money Forbes had cleared during his tour. Smythe informed Sala that he would have to hear him first and Sala responded by telling Smythe to \"...go to the lower levels of Tartarus!.\" A local consortium then engaged Sala, brought him to Australia and upon finding him difficult to manage, asked Smythe to take him off their hands. From 1885 until 1886 Smythe gladly contracted with Sala and earned them both a handsome profit."]}]}}
