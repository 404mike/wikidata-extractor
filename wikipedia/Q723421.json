Macaulay left Arsenal for Fulham in June 1950; in all he made 108 appearances in three seasons, scoring one goal. He also won six more caps for Scotland while at Arsenal, bringing his total tally to seven.

However, given the age of the Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were Denis and Leslie Compton), long-term success was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton.

His full professional debut was made in 1972 at the age of 16 against Durban City. In 1973 Mike was invited to go on trial with Arsenal in England. He spent 6 months on trial but was not signed. He returned to Rangers. In 1974 Eddie Firmani, the new coach of the Tampa Bay Rowdies in Tampa USA, was scouting for players in South Africa. Rangers was playing Arcadia Shepherds who featured Steve Wegerle. After Mike was substituted his father confronted Alex Forbes on the field. An act Eddie Firmani realised gave him opportunity to get Mike. In 1975 at the age of 18 Mike arrived in Tampa, Florida USA.  He remained under contract every season for the Rowdies until the NASL collapsed in 1984. He was forced to miss the entire 1976 outdoor and 1976 indoor seasons while he fulfilled his South African military obligation. His years with the team included one championship, in 1975, and two runners-up, in 1978 and 1979. In NASL indoor he won one championship in 1979-80 and one runner-up in 1981-82. Connell was also part of the 1983 Indoor Grand Prix winning side, though he did not play in the final due to injury. He was a 1979 and 1980 First Team All Star and a 1982 Honourable Mention All Star. He ranks third in career NASL regular season games played with 252. Connell holds the NASL all-time record for consecutive regular season starts with 179. The streak came to an unceremonious end on the last day of the 1984 season, with Connell's somewhat controversial benching by then coach and former teammate, Rodney Marsh, in what was to be the Rowdies final NASL game. In 1985, he spent some time with both the recently-independent Tulsa Roughnecks,http://www.nasljerseys.com/images/Roughnecks/1985-05-29%20Roughnecks-Sheffield%20United%20Lineup%20(2).jpg and also the Tulsa Tornados of the United Soccer League After the USL folded midseason, he returned to the Rowdies, now playing as an independent club for one match.
