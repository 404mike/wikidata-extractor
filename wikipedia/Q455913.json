The show brought together material from the pigeon and soul projects, with stories from Melody's own childhood in Cheshire.

Melody celebrates the social oddities of these cultural institutions with a respectful tenderness that resonates with her own peculiarities as she relates her project-work to personal experiences of growing up as an ostracised figure \u2013 unpopular in schools and society, and sidelined to a certain extent at home.'Thomas Bacon, 'Victoria Melody: Northern Soul', Total Theatre, 5 November 2012"]}, {"page": "Big Burns Supper Festival", "response": ["The festival in Dumfries is thought to be the largest event of its type in the world attracting over 26,000 people per year and takes place at the festival village which includes the Famous Spiegeltent.
