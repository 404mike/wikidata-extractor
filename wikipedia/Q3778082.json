The results, as with the debut single, are mixed. Chris' brattish, high-pitched voice is full of unconvincing warbles and wails - it doesn't quite back up the supposedly angry stance as much as it should. The highly derivative songwriting also doesn't do much to convince, but while the project doesn't offer anything in terms of truly serious musical merit, Chris himself is full of youthful verve and does deliver on the entertainment front.\""]}, {"page": "Kirkley", "response": ["* Lil' Chris featured in Channel 4's Rock School programme filmed at Kirkley High School and went on to have a musical career."]}, {"page": "Checkin' It Out", "response": ["\"Checkin' It Out\" was the first single from British singer Lil' Chris' debut self-titled album.
