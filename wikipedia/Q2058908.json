On the same line, Alvin Jackson has stated that while some of the Cumann na nGaedheal leadership \"flirted with paramilitarism and the trappings of fascism\", in his view \"O\u2019Duffy\u2019s fondness for outrageous rhetoric and elaborate uniforms was more O'Connellite than Hitlerian\".  Historian John Joseph Lee has remarked that \"Fascism was far too intellectually demanding for the bulk of the Blueshirts\" Marxist historian John Newsinger disputes this line of thinking somewhat by agreeing that the rank and file of the Blueshirts were not ideologically fascists, but so long as the leadership was, the consequences of the Blueshirts coming to power would have been one-party state dictatorship."]}, {"page": "Campbell College", "response": ["*Paul Bew, scholar and life peer"]}, {"page": "Michael Davitt", "response": ["According to English historian Michael Kelly, Davitt's public renunciation of political violence made him \"the Irish Republican Brotherhood's greatest apostate\".  Davitt opposed the random use of force, such as by the Ribbon societies. On the other hand, he never fully renounced violence and, according to Irish historian Paul Bew, was involved in smuggling arms for the IRB between his first release from prison and his expulsion from the IRB council in 1880. Because he considered the landlord system inherently violent, Davitt believed it was moral to use force against it. However, for political reasons he presented the Land League as a peaceful movement and denied that his anti-landlord speeches and comments consisted of incitement to violence. Davitt denounced agrarian crime as \"a species of cowardly terrorism which would do irreparable injury to Ireland\" and the Maamtrasna murders as \"almost without a parallel for its atrocity in the annals of agrarian outrage\". However, the Land League leaders were not in control of their rank-and-file, who frequently used violence to intimidate others into withholding rent and to frighten landlords and their agents. Between 1879 and 1881, crimes related to the Land War rose from 25% to 58% of all crime in Ireland, without the leaders calling for an end to the agitation. Davitt's \"final break with the Fenians\" did not come until the 1882 Phoenix Park murders of the Chief Secretary and Permanent Undersecretary for Ireland."]}, {"page": "House of Lords Appointments Commission", "response": ["*Paul Bew"]}, {"page": "Bruce Anderson (columnist)", "response": ["Anderson was born in Orkney, and was educated at Campbell College, Belfast, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he read History.

As the publication of the commission's award would have an immediate legal effect, the Free State government quickly entered into talks with the British and Northern Ireland governments. In late November members of the Irish government visited London and Chequers; their view was that Article 12 was only intended to award areas within the six counties of Northern Ireland to the Free State, whereas the British insisted that the entire 1920 boundary was adjustable in either direction."]}, {"page": "Repartition of Ireland", "response": ["A de facto border was established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, in which the British Government established (or attempted to establish) two devolved administrations within the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. The former consisted of north-easterly six of the nine counties of Ulster; the latter of the remaining 26 (including three of Ulster). In 1925, the Irish Boundary Commission was established to consider whether a more appropriate border might be drawn. On 7 November 1925 an English Conservative newspaper, The Morning Post, published leaked notes of the negotiations, including a draft map. The overall effects of the Boundary Commission's recommendations would have been the transfer of 286 square miles to the Free State and 77 square miles to Northern Ireland.'The Irish Border: History, Politics, Culture' By Malcolm Anderson, Eberhard Bort, pg. 96 The leaked report included, accurately, the Boundary Commission recommendation that parts of east Donegal would be transferred to Northern Ireland, plus several other small tracts (see list here).

Compounded by the reduction in opportunities for outside income, especially seasonal agricultural income in Great Britain, many smallholders were faced with hunger and unable to pay their rent. Some landlords offered rent abatement, while others refused on the grounds that their tenants were participating in anti-landlord agitation. Irish historian Paul Bew notes that five of the largest landlords in Connacht also refused to contribute any money to relief funds, despite collecting more than \u00a380,000 annually in rent. According to historians such as William Vaughan and Phillip Bull, the serious agricultural recession combined with a unified nationalist leadership prepared to exploit the discontent of the masses to produce a powerful and lasting popular movement."]}, {"page": "Maurice Healy", "response": ["* Paul Bew, Healy, Timothy Michael (1855\u20131931) in: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004)"]}, {"page": "1950 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*22 January \u2013 Paul Bew, professor of Irish politics at Queen's University of Belfast."]}, {"page": "Lord Bew", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Bew"]}, {"page": "Baron Bew", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Bew"]}, {"page": "John Patrick Hayden", "response": ["* Paul Bew, Conflict and Conciliation in Ireland 1890\u20131910:  Parnellites and Radical Agrarians, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1987"]}, {"page": "Irish neutrality during World War II", "response": ["De Valera denounced reports of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as \"anti-national propaganda\"; according to Paul Bew, this was not out of disbelief but rather because the Holocaust undermined the assumptions underlying Irish neutrality: moral equivalence between the Allies and the Axis, and the idea that the Irish were the most persecuted people in Europe."]}, {"page": "John Henry Whyte", "response": ["Following his death Whyte's family, friends, and colleagues set up the John Whyte Trust Fund to continue Whyte's work, honour his memory and encourage \"informed dialogue and interaction at graduate level among people who are likely to be leaders and opinion-shapers\".

The AHS has published numerous pamphlets on local history matters, often in relation to the Home Rule politician William O'Brien, the novelist Canon Patrick Sheehan, and the local poet Ned Buckley. According to Jack Lane, the AHS was originally intended to be a local history organisation, but later expanded into the role of opposing the \"revisionist\" movement in Irish history.\"BICO Is Dead\u2014Long Live BICO!\" by Jack Lane, A Review of What? Irish Political Review, Jan. 2009, pp. 36\u201337 . The Society has been highly critical of Peter Hart, whom it accuses of falsifying interview material,An Phoblacht \"Hart Trouble Diagnosed\"  Review of the AHS' book Troubled History,which is critical of Hart with denunciations of Roy Foster, Brian Hanley, Paul Bew, and Henry Patterson. The AHS regularly attacks Hubert Butler (whom it accuses of being a quasi-racist defender of Protestant Ascendancy) and Elizabeth Bowen, whom it claims acted as a British spy in Ireland during the Second World War and hence lacking any Irish identity.For the AHS' criticism of Bowen, see \"The Dubliner:The Life Times & Works of  James Clarence Mangan\", Clifford 1988, \"A North Cork Anthology\" by Jack Lane, 1993, and \"Notes on Eire\" by Clifford & Lane 2008.
