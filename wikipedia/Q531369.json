V. Barker FRSL (born 1958) is an English historian, specialising in the Middle Ages and literary biography.  She is the author of a number of well-regarded works on the Bront\u00ebs, William Wordsworth, and medieval tournaments. From 1983 to 1989 she was the curator and librarian of the Bronte Parsonage Museum.Barker was educated at Bradford Girls' Grammar School and St Anne's College, Oxford, where she gained her doctorate in medieval history.A biography and summary of each book can be found on her official website, which was launched September 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anne Bront\u00eb", "response": ["But since the mid-20th century her life and works have been given better attention.

It was a disastrous attempt. The French knights were unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the array of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. John Keegan argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation, long-range shots used as the charge started. The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk from St. Denis who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.", "The French had suffered a catastrophic defeat. In all, around 6,000 of their fighting men lay dead on the ground. The list of casualties, one historian has noted, \"read like a roll call of the military and political leaders of the past generation\". Among them were 90\u2013120 great lords and bannerets killed, including three dukes (Alen\u00e7on, Bar and Brabant), nine counts (Bl\u00e2mont, Dreux, Fauquembergue, Grandpr\u00e9, Marle, Nevers, Roucy, Vaucourt, Vaud\u00e9mont) and one viscount (Puisaye), also an archbishop. Of the great royal office holders, France lost its constable (Albret), an admiral (the lord of Dampierre), the Master of Crossbowmen (David de Rambures, dead along with three sons), Master of the Royal Household (Guichard Dauphin) and pr\u00e9v\u00f4t of the marshals. According to the heralds, 3,069 knights and squires were killed, while at least 2,600 more corpses were found without coats of arms to identify them. Entire noble families were wiped out in the male line, and in some regions an entire generation of landed nobility was annihilated. The bailiffs of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle \"cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in Artois, Ponthieu, Normandy, Picardy.\"", "Most primary sources which describe the battle have English outnumbered by several times. By contrast, Anne Curry in her 2005 book Agincourt: A New History, argued, based on research into the surviving administrative records, that the French army was 12,000 strong, and the English army 9,000, proportions of four to three. While not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, states the French probably had 12,000\u201315,000 troops. Juliet Barker, Jonathan Sumption and Clifford J. Rogers criticized Curry's reliance on administrative records, arguing that they are incomplete and that several of the available primary sources already offer a credible assessment of the numbers involved. Ian Mortimer endorsed Curry's methodology, though applied it more liberally, noting how she \"minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)\", and concluded that \"the most extreme imbalance which is credible\" is 15,000 French against 8,000\u20139,000 English. Barker opined that \"if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries\"."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "response": ["Elizabeth Gaskell's biography The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb was published in 1857. It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another, and Gaskell's approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject's achievements, she concentrated on private details of Bront\u00eb's life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of \"coarseness\" that had been levelled at her writing. The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Bront\u00eb's love for H\u00e9ger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Bront\u00eb's father, widower, and friends. Mrs Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Bront\u00eb, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Bront\u00eb's diary papers, in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage.Juliet Barker, The Bront\u00ebs It has been argued that Gaskell's approach transferred the focus of attention away from the 'difficult' novels, not just Bront\u00eb's, but all the sisters', and began a process of sanctification of their private lives.", "* The Bront\u00ebs, Juliet Barker", "* A Life in Letters, selected by Juliet Barker"]}, {"page": "Walter Scott", "response": ["Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights was influenced by the novels of Walter Scott.Elizabeth Gaskell The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1857, p.104.

When it became due for a reprint, just over a year after Anne's death, Charlotte prevented its re-publication. (The novel was out of print in England until 1854, but not in America, which had no copyright restriction.) Some critics believe that Charlotte's suppression of the book was to protect her younger sister's memory from further onslaughts. Others believe Charlotte was jealous of her younger sister. Even before Anne's death Charlotte had criticized the novel, stating in a letter to W.S. Williams: \"That it had faults of execution, faults of art, was obvious, but faults of intention of feeling could be suspected by none who knew the writer. For my part, I consider the subject unfortunately chosen \u2013 it was one the author was not qualified to handle at once vigorously and truthfully. The simple and natural \u2013 quiet description and simple pathos \u2013 are, I think Acton Bell's forte. I liked Agnes Grey better than the present work.\" Juliet Barker, in her biography of the Bront\u00ebs, concluded that \"Charlotte, it appears, was prepared to consign her sister\u2019s novel to oblivion because she considered its subject at odds with her own perception of what Anne\u2019s character was and ought to have been.\""]}, {"page": "Bront\u00eb family", "response": ["However, Charlotte did not allow herself to be discouraged.

She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt \"more than surprise ..., a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music \u2013 wild, melancholy, and elevating.\" In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity.

At Coleridge's invitation, he visited the poet at his cottage who encouraged him to pursue his translations of Horace's Odes. In June 1840 he sent the translations to Coleridge, despite having been sacked by the Postlethwaites. According to Juliet Barker's biography of the Bront\u00ebs, he may have fathered an illegitimate child during time in the town, but others suspect that it may be more of Bront\u00eb's boasting. Coleridge began an encouraging letter about the quality of the translations in November\u2013December 1840 but never finished it.", "Bront\u00eb returned home to his family at the Haworth parsonage, where he looked for another job, wrote poetry and attempted to adapt Angrian material into a book called And the Weary are at Rest. During the 1840s, several of his poems were published in local newspapers under the name of Northangerland, making him the first of the Bront\u00ebs to be a published poet. Soon however, after Mr Robinson's death, Mrs Robinson made clear that she was not going to marry Branwell, who then \"declined into chronic alcoholism, opiates and debt\". Charlotte's letters from this time demonstrate that she was angered by his behaviour. In January 1847, he wrote to his friend Leyland about the easy existence he hoped for: \"to try and make myself a name in the world of posterity, without being pestered by the small but countless botherments.\" His behaviour became increasingly impossible and embarrassing to the family. He managed to set fire to his bed, after which his father had to sleep with him for the safety of the family. Towards the end of his life he was sending notes to a friend asking of \"Five pence (5d) worth of Gin\".  Charlotte Bront\u00eb wrote to her publisher that Branwell died without \"ever knowing that his sisters had published a line. \" However, according to Juliet Barker's biography, Branwell may have known about his sisters' publication of their poetry, having been the accidental recipient of some proofs since their pseudonyms were thought to be male. Also, Barker says his friends said he claimed authorship of Wuthering Heights!(Though they may have said this out of loyalty.)", "*The Bront\u00ebs by Juliet Barker (London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1994)"]}, {"page": "Dafydd Gam", "response": ["Stories of Gam's exploits at Battle of Agincourt in which he saved Henry V's life, and that he was knighted either posthumously or as he was dying on the field of victory at Agincourt by King Henry V as a result, are not vouched for in contemporary sources and have thus been discounted by many historians.The latter version is given in  Baldo does not mention why Dafydd ap Llewelyn was knighted. According to the legend the intervention occurred during the counter-charge of John I, Duke of Alen\u00e7on, which certainly is historical, leading to the wounding of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and Henry fighting hand-to-hand in the late stage of the battle. The King was hard pressed and the Duke of Alen\u00e7on supposedly cut an ornament from Henry's crown with a sword blow. Then a group of Welsh knights in the King's bodyguard led by Dafydd Gam intervened to save Henry's life, only for some to be killed in doing so, including Dafydd himself, and his son in law Sir Roger Vaughan. One of those supposedly involved in this exploit was Sir William ap Thomas who survived the battle. Some accounts claim Dafydd slew the Duke of Alen\u00e7on himself. This story was being frequently told by the Tudor period in histories of the campaign and by the descendants of those involved and was widely accepted as the truth at that time. Although both Gam and Vaughan did die in the battle, the exact circumstances of their deaths are unknown. Gam's reputation was still very much alive in 19th-century Wales. George Borrow said of him, \"where he achieved that glory which will for ever bloom, dying, covered with wounds, on the field of Agincourt after saving the life of the king, to whom in the dreadest and most critical moment of the fight he stuck closer than a brother\". George Borrow, Wild Wales Juliet Barker, while not accepting the rest of the legend, claims in her history of Agincourt that \"Llewelyn was knighted on the field, only to fall in the battle.\" She also says that Dafydd's Welsh comrade, and posthumous son-in-law, Sir William ap Thomas may have been knighted at the battle."]}, {"page": "Patrick Bront\u00eb", "response": ["* The Bront\u00ebs, Juliet Barker (1995)"]}, {"page": "Richard Barber", "response": ["* with Juliet Barker: Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages (Woodbridge: Boydell, 1989)."]}, {"page": "William Frend (reformer)", "response": ["On leaving Cambridge he came to London.
