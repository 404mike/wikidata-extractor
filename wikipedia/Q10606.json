Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and reluctance to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the suggestion that he didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent crosser of the ball when he did venture forward.

During this period he oversaw the development of players such as Ashley Young, Lloyd Doyley and Hamer Bouazza, and helped Watford to a Premier Reserve League win in 2002\u201303. Following Ray Lewington's sacking in March 2005, Gibbs briefly managed Watford on a caretaker basis, although his reign did not include a single game. Following the appointment of Aidy Boothroyd, Gibbs left Watford in July. Having had a formal connection with the club since the 1970s, he felt that his departure had been \"very poorly handled\". In 2006, Gibbs received his UEFA Pro Licence, which means he can manage any football club in England on a full-time basis. At the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season, Gibbs joined the management team at Reading, where his initial responsibility was working with the younger players at the club. Further Premier Reserve League success followed in 2007, and Gibbs was promoted to the role of assistant manager in 2009\u201310. On the penultimate game of the season, Reading faced Watford at Vicarage Road. A Reading victory would have put their opponents in danger of relegation, but Watford emerged 3\u20130 winners to seal their Championship survival.

In the 40th minute, Balanta won an aerial challenge against Lloyd Doyley and found unmarked Martin Rowlands with a lob. Rowlands scored with a chip over Richard Lee from an acute angle.

Losing his marker Hulse, DeMerit scored with a  header from Young's corner.  It was the American defender's third goal of his first season in English football after failing to be drafted into Major League Soccer.  Leeds had a penalty claim just before half-time, when Foster appeared to foul Hulse, but it was rejected by Dean.  Soon after, from a diagonal free kick, Sean Gregan's header at the far post went outside the Watford post.

At the end of Watford's 2010\u201311 campaign, the club exercised its option and signed Bennett through the 2012\u20132013 season. On 27 October 2011, Bennett joined Brentford on a month's loan. He scored his first career goal on his Brentford debut, the winner in a 2\u20131 win over Chesterfield on 29 October 2011. This proved to be his only appearance for the Bees as injury ruled him out of all other games during his loan spell. Once recovered from his injury, Bennett re-joined Brentford on loan on 1 January 2012 for 28 days. He made four appearances before returning to Watford. Bennett made his first start for Watford in the 2011\u201312 season away to West Ham United on 7 March 2012.
