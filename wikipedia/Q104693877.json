Hunter soon moved on to Falkirk at the end of 1919, spending the next four years with the Bairns and being selected twice for the Scottish Football League XI in 1923.In January 1924 he returned to Newcastle for a free of \u00a33,500 with the club anticipating the need to replace defender Frank Hudspeth who was then 33, but the veteran played on for several more years. Hunter served as back-up until 1925, with a high asking price deterring clubs in Britain; instead he moved away to play in the American Soccer League with New Bedford Whalers, where he played until 1930.", "link_mentions": {}}}
