He was the final Member of Parliament to be elected by the single transferable vote.Standing as a Labour candidate, he unsuccessfully contested the Oxford constituency at the 1924 by-election, Harrow at the 1924 general election and Worcester in 1929.  When the Labour Party split in 1931 and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald formed a National Government with the Conservative Party, Lindsay followed MacDonald into the breakaway National Labour group.\nIn 1933, Craigie Aitchison, the National Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilmarnock, was appointed as a judge, vacating his seat.  At the resulting by-election on 2 November, Lindsay defeated the Labour candidate, and was re-elected comfortably at the 1935 general election.  He held the seat until 1945, later sitting as a National Independent.\nHe was Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1935 to 1937, and then Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education from 1937 to 1940.\nHe did not contest Kilmarnock at the 1945 general election, but was elected as an independent member for the Combined English Universities, holding the seat until the university constituencies were abolished for the 1950 general election.", "link_mentions": {}}}
