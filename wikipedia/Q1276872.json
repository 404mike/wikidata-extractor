He was born in Osgathorpe, Leicestershire on 4 June 1753 and died in Liverpool on 30 November 1812.   He had a twin brother Thomas (1753\u20131808) who was also a painter. They both entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1775 during the period of the presidency of Sir Joshua Reynolds,  exhibiting in London, including at the Royal Academy. John Boultbee exhibited six paintings at the Royal Academy The first in 1776 (A landscape) and the last two in 1788 (Portrait of Horses and Portrait of a favourite horse of Mr Bakewell).John Boultbee was greatly admired by George III, who commissioned several horse-portraits by him and assigned him a residence in Windsor Great Park so that he might carry out his painting duties more conveniently. Boultbee was influenced by the work of George Stubbs, and Sawrey Gilpin. Later in life he lived and worked in Derby, Leicestershire, Chester and finally Liverpool where he died in 1812.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Durham Ox", "response": ["thumb|300px|Etching of the Durham Ox by John Boultbee (1753\u20131812)", "A dedication accompanying a 1802 painting of the ox by John Boultbee (1753\u20131812) gave details of the animal's measurements and estimated its weight as 171 stone (1,086 kg), but later estimates ran as high as 270 stone (1,715 kg), although there may be some confusion, as the stone was not a standardised weight at the time. Whilst his size and weight partially account for the admiration he attracted, he was also regarded as a particularly fine and well-proportioned example of his type, at a time when the concept of selective breeding for specific characteristics was becoming established in agriculture.", "The ox was painted by various artists during his lifetime and pictures of him were reproduced and sold commercially. A coloured engraving after John Boultbee's picture of 1802 sold 2,000 prints in that year alone. China and porcelain were decorated with pictures of the ox, including a range of blue and white Staffordshire pottery.Unattributed maker Durham Ox series china at the Virtual Museum, www.blueandwhite.com.
