June's performances in the chorus led to her appointment as a principal soloist for the 1957\u201358 season. Her solo career began with \u201ca promising Musetta\u201d in La boh\u00e8me and followed this by playing The Foreign Women in The Consul by Gian Carlo Menotti. June's 1958 Covent Garden debut saw her perform as the Heavenly Voice in Luchino Visconti's production of Don Carlos by Giuseppe Verdi and was conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini. When Fidelio returned the next year under Rudolf Schwarz, June sang Marcellina and repeated this performance in 1960 but with Colin Davis as the conductor. That same year, she made her first (and only) appearance with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under Alexander Gibson as Abigaille in Verdi's Nabucco with concert performances in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
