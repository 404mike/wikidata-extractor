All the strategic positions and important buildings were immediately seized, and Major General Horatius Murray was taken to General Noeldechen for the official surrender of the 438th German Division. Three hours later, groups of partisan forces arrived on a train they had seized in the Rosental valley the day before, at the same time as Yugoslav regular forces of the IVth army.August Walzl, K\u00e4rnten 1946, p. 176f, p. 194. All the Western sources agree on that date, contrary to Yugoslav or Slovene sources.  Karel Pu\u0161nik-Ga\u0161per and others, Gemsen auf der Lawine. Der Partisanenkampf in K\u00e4rnten, Klagenfurt: Drava 1980, pp.305 ff., still claims that Yugoslav partisan forces liberated Klagenfurt on 7 May, disarming the last Hitler units. Similarly, the Bulgarian publication Otecestvenata vojna na Bulgarija 1944\u20131945, Sofia 1965, vol. 3, p. 258 writes of the plans for an advance as far as Klagenfurt and Villach. This advance, however, came to a halt at Lavam\u00fcnd, cf. Walzl, K\u00e4rnten 1945, pp. 178 f., 225 f., 241. Both of these forces made their way through the city's streets which were jammed with tens of thousands of Volksdeutsche refugees, and masses of soldiers of all the nationalities that had been fighting under German command and were now fleeing the Russians. These partisan and Yugoslav regular forces claimed the city and the surrounding South Carinthian land, establishing the Komanda staba za Koro\u0161ka, which would be named the \"Commandantura of the Carinthian Military Zone\" under Major Egon Remec.Zbornik dokumentov in podatkov v narodno osvobodilni vojni jugoslovanskih narodov.
