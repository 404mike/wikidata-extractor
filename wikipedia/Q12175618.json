Improved graphics mean the characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games.

He was also the man who killed Annie by pushing her down the stairs after an argument. After the murder, Owen immediately turned to his new girlfriend, Janey Harris, whom Owen had been having an affair with during his relationship with Annie. After an unsuccessful attempt to haunt Owen and Janey, during which he attempted to mock her for her 'pathetic' hanging around, Annie later confronted him with George and Mitchell, revealing their true nature and telling Owen a secret about what happens upon someone's death. This secret, which was unheard by the viewer, drove Owen mad with fear and compelled him to confess his crime to the police so that he can be kept safe from 'them'. Owen is currently incarcerated in an asylum, although his information allowed Kemp to identify Mitchell, George and Annie as their true natures."]}, {"page": "Annie Sawyer", "response": ["The first series premiere (2009) establishes Annie as being unable to remember her death. She believes ex-fianc\u00e9 Owen's (Gregg Chillin) claims that she fell down the stairs accidentally. Annie frustrates George (Russell Tovey) because of her temperament and her tendency to constantly make tea she cannot drink, though Mitchell (Aidan Turner) is more sympathetic towards her. In the third episode, he introduces Annie to Gilbert (Alex Price), another ghost, who falls in love with her. When Owen arrives to clear a blocked pipe and produces a thong, Annie's memories of her death are triggered and shown in flashback. Owen had pushed her down the stairs after an argument; their relationship had been abusive, not the loving one she had imagined to be true. Memories of her death cause Annie to become a poltergeist able to move objects and turn machines on without touching them although she cannot control these abilities. To resolve her death Annie seeks a confession from Owen; he taunts her haunting effects as ineffectual and reveals that he was unfaithful throughout their relationship. Annie is inspired by her and George's rescue of Mitchell from a vampire coven and with their help stands up to Owen. After Owen has a mental breakdown and confesses, the Door to Death appears for Annie but she stays behind because her friends need her. In the final episode, a more confident Annie shows the ability to teleport further distances and greater powers of telekinesis, which she describes as \"a whole new skill set.\""]}, {"page": "John Mitchell (Being Human)", "response": ["Guy Flanagan was cast as Mitchell in the Being Human Pilot. The pilot was broadcast in 2008. When Andrea Riseborough announced that she wouldn't be available for an upcoming series of Being Human, the producers had to do a recasting. This way also the dynamic of the main characters would change, which made the production crew rethink their previous casting choices. Creator Toby Whithouse later said that the pilot vampires were a \u201cbit to Anne Rice\u201d for his liking. So it was decided to change the actors of the pilot's vampires, including Mitchell. Actor Gregg Chillin read for Mitchell but was later cast as Owen. When Aidan Turner got a call from his agent about auditioning for a new drama Being Human, Turner's initial reaction was to turn the offer down. He didn't know what to make of the show's concept, which sounded bizarre to him. As soon as he got the script, Turners opinion of the show changed. He auditioned for the role and got it a few time later. The changing of the actor of Mitchell changed not only the personality of Mitchell, but also of the characters around him. Russell Tovey said in an interview that the George that he played alongside Guy Flanagan (Mitchell - Pilot) and Andrea Riseborough (Annie - Pilot) was different from the George that he played alongside Lenora Crichlow and Aidan Turner, because each actor would respond differently to the character."]}, {"page": "Zen (TV series)", "response": ["| Pepe Spadola || Gregg Chillin || colspan=\"2\"| "]}, {"page": "Kidnap and Ransom", "response": ["* Gregg Chillin as Mahavir Mehta, the instigator of the first kidnapping and Leela's boyfriend."]}, {"page": "Scott & Bailey", "response": ["* Gregg Chillin as Detective Sergeant Neil Simpson (Series 5), an officer within the Serious Crime Unit."]}, {"page": "Da Vinci's Demons", "response": ["* Gregg Chillin as Zoroaster da Peretola (recurring seasons 1\u20132; main season 3)"]}, {"page": "Inside Men", "response": ["* Gregg Chillin as Riaz Kureshi"]}, {"page": "Episode 1 (Being Human series 1)", "response": ["| Gregg Chillin"]}, {"page": "List of Scott & Bailey characters", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" | Gregg Chillin", "Neil Simpson (Gregg Chillin) is a SCAS Detective who appears in the fifth series.
