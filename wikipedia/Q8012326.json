Known mainly for his speculative ideas on chemical combination, William Higgins is popular for the insights his life offers into the emergence of chemistry as a career during the British Industrial Revolution. Despite an evident charm, his erratic behaviour and tendency to indulge personal animosities prevented him from engaging the affections of London society.  Instead he found refuge in a succession of government-supported chemical positions in Dublin.  Thanks to the combination of such scientific opportunities with family resources, he became a very wealthy man.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Dalton", "response": ["From 1814 to 1819, Irish chemist William Higgins claimed that Dalton had plagiarised his ideas, but Higgins' theory did not address relative atomic mass. However, recent evidence suggests that Dalton's development of thought may have been influenced by the ideas of another Irish chemist Bryan Higgins, who was William's uncle. Bryan believed that an atom was a heavy central particle surrounded by an atmosphere of caloric, the supposed substance of heat at the time. The size of the atom was determined by the diameter of the caloric atmosphere. Based on the evidence, Dalton was aware of Bryan's theory and adopted very similar ideas and language, but he never acknowledged Bryan's anticipation of his caloric model. However, the essential novelty of Dalton's atomic theory is that he provided a method of calculating relative atomic weights for the chemical elements, something that neither Bryan nor William Higgins did; his priority for that crucial step is uncontested."]}, {"page": "Connacht", "response": ["* William Higgins, chemist (1763\u20131825)"]}, {"page": "1825 in science", "response": ["* June \u2013 William Higgins (born 1763), Irish chemist."]}, {"page": "1763 in science", "response": ["*William Higgins, Irish chemist (died 1825)"]}, {"page": "Valence (chemistry)", "response": ["In 1789, William Higgins published views on what he called combinations of \"ultimate\" particles, which foreshadowed the concept of valency bonds.

In particular, since 1758 Scottish chemist William Cullen in his lectures used what he called \"affinity diagrams\" to represent forces supposedly existing between pairs of molecules in a chemical reaction. In a 1789 book by William Higgins similar diagrams were used to represent forces within molecules. These and some other contemporary diagrams had no relation to chemical bonds: the latter notion was introduced only in the following century.Danail Bonchev (1991) \"Chemical Graph Theory: Introduction and Fundamentals\" "]}, {"page": "1763 in Ireland", "response": ["*William Higgins, chemist (died 1825)."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| William Higgins||12/06/1806||? 1762 \u2013 30 June 1825"]}, {"page": "Leskean Cabinet", "response": ["In 1795 William Higgins was made professor of chemistry and mineralogy to the Dublin Society and the Leskean cabinet was placed under his care.
