While his early career as an upper-middle order batsman showed promise, he was soon being dismissed for smaller totals than his earlier form would have allowed for, apart from a half-century against Nottinghamshire and 42 not out against Essex. He played in Derbyshire's last match of the season against Glamorgan, but did not reappear in the following season.\nGoodwin was a left-handed batsman who played 16 innings in 8 matches with top score of 53 and an average of 14.93. He was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler and took a total of 7 wickets at an average of 29.28 and a best performance of 4-25.Goodwin's brother, Harry, four and a half years his junior, played Minor Counties cricket for Staffordshire for three years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1921", "response": ["With a considerable amount of new blood in 1920, there were no lasting additions to the Derbyshire side in 1921. John Fisher only played in two seasons and George Goodwin in just one season.  George Buckley and Herbert Turland made one appearance each for the side, although Turland later played in a match for Nottinghamshire.
