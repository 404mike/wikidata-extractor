He made one appearance for Scotland in 1896 while playing club football for St Bernard's in Edinburgh, where he also won the Scottish Cup a year earlier. He began and ended his career at Vale of Leven and also featured for Clyde.Some publications assert that Robert Paton, also an international from the same neighbourhood, was his brother, but this is incorrect; however his actual elder brothers were footballers: Alex had several seasons with Bolton Wanderers, and Jim also played for Vale of Leven and Aston Villa.", "link_mentions": {}}}
