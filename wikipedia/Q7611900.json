The club's youth coach, Steve Beaglehole replaces Bremner as manager. Manchester United regain their lead of the First Division with a 2-0 win over Sheffield United, who are still bottom of the table. Leeds are held to a goalless draw by Wimbledon, which means that Alex Ferguson's team are now leading the league by a single point and having a game in hand. Liverpool's erratic form continues with a 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, while Manchester City maintain their title push with a 3-0 away win over struggling Southampton, whose 21-year-old striker Alan Shearer is now being strongly linked with a move to the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool."]}, {"page": "Nicky Eaden", "response": ["During the 2012\u201313 season, Eaden worked alongside Steve Beaglehole for Leicester City under-21s as a coach.

But the managerial story took another twist when he walked out on 24 October to take over from the sacked Sammy Lee at Bolton.

Aged 18, he made his debut in that match as a starter but was sent-off for two bookable offences by referee Nicolai Vollquartz.
