Here, he is portrayed as a chimney sweep with a Cockney accent who is recruited by the White Rabbit and the Dodo to go down the Rabbit's chimney to pull the \"monster\" (Alice, made giant) out of the house. He seems all right with the task at first, but when he sees Alice in the window and realizes that he's been asked to retrieve a \"monster\", he tries to run in terror. However, the Dodo catches him and forces him down the chimney, telling him this could be his moment of glory. Unlike the book, he is not kicked out, since Alice's hands and legs are sticking out outside of the house. Instead, he spreads a lot of soot, causing Alice to begin to sneeze. Hearing her inhale frantically, the White Rabbit hides and the Dodo is knocked off the roof from Alice wriggling inside as she tries to suppress the sneeze. Bill, however, cannot escape in time, and Alice's sneeze is so big it blows all the soot out of the house and rockets Bill into the sky. The Rabbit and Dodo watch him disappear and Dodo smiles, \"Well, there goes Bill.\" Alice, recovered from her sternutation, peeps out the window and utters: \"Poor Bill.\" He is not seen again. He was voiced by Larry Grey."]}, {"page": "List of Disney animated universe characters", "response": ["|Bill the Lizard||Larry Grey||Alice in Wonderland", "|Footman||Larry Grey||Cinderella"]}, {"page": "List of minor characters in the Alice series", "response": ["In the 1951 film several of the Card Soldiers in the Queen's court are executioners.
