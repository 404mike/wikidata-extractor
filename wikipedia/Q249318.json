As a subaltern he was decorated for the rescue of a group of soldiers under heavy fire in 1917.\nHe left the army on 24 April 1919 and joined the diplomatic service. He held several consular positions in northern Africa and the Middle East before and during the Second World War. Post-war he was posted to the newly liberated Dutch East Indies, before being posted to Bogot\u00e1 in 1947.\nIn retirement he lived in Spain, where he died and was buried. Although his grave was saved from disturbance following threats from Spanish authorities in May 2010, in November 2011 his remains were reburied in a garden of remembrance at the Fusilier Museum in Bury, Greater Manchester. Mackereth is believed to be the first soldier from World War I to be repatriated to England since the burial of the Unknown Soldier at Westminster Abbey in 1920.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine", "response": ["Tegart and his deputy David Petrie (later head of MI5) advised a greater emphasis on foreign intelligence gathering and closure of Palestine's borders. Like many of those enrolled in the Palestinian gendarmerie, Tegart had served in Great Britain's repression of the Irish War of Independence, and the security proposals he introduced exceeded measures adopted down to this time elsewhere in the British Empire. 70 fortresses were erected throughout the country at strategic choke points and near Palestinian villages which, if assessed as \"bad\", were subjected to collective punishment.Benjamin-Grob-Fitzgibbon,'Britain's small wars: the challenge to Empire,' in Randall D. Law, The Routledge History of Terrorism, Routledge, 2015, pp. 177\u2013189, 181. Accordingly, from 1938 Gilbert Mackereth, the British Consul in Damascus, corresponded with Syrian and Transjordan authorities regarding border control and security to counteract arms smuggling and \"terrorist\" infiltration and produced a report for Tegart on the activities of the Palestine Defence Committee in Damascus. Tegart recommended the construction of a frontier road with a barbed wire fence, which became known as Tegart's wall, along the borders with Lebanon and Syria to help prevent the flow of insurgents, goods and weapons. Tegart encouraged close co-operation with the Jewish Agency. It was built by the Histadrut construction company Solel Boneh. The total cost was \u00a32\u00a0million. The Army forced the fellahin to work on the roads without pay.", "Fakhri Abdul Hadi of Arrabah worked closely with Fawzi al-Qawukji in 1936, but later defected to the British authorities. He bargained for a pardon by offering to collaborate with the British on countering rebel propaganda. Once on the payroll of the British consul in Damascus, Gilbert Mackereth, he carried out many attacks against the rebels in 1938\u20131939 as leader of his own \"peace band\"."]}, {"page": "Sir Gilbert Mackereth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gilbert Mackereth"]}, {"page": "Gilbert MacKereth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gilbert Mackereth"]}, {"page": "Sir Gilbert Mackereth KCMG MC", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gilbert Mackereth"]}, {"page": "Mackereth", "response": ["*Gilbert Mackereth (1892\u20131962), British army officer and diplomat"]}, {"page": "1952 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Gilbert Mackereth , His Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at Bogota."]}, {"page": "1939 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Colonel Gilbert Mackereth, , His Majesty's Consul at Damascus."]}]}}
