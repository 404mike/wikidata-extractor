He was the first European to discover the ruins of Harappa near Sahiwal in Punjab, now in Pakistan. He found the ancient city of Alexandria in the Caucasus (modern Begram) dating to Alexander the Great.  He unlocked the now-extinct language known as Kharoshthi.At the time of the 1838 First Anglo-Afghan War, Masson had spent more time in Afghanistan then any other British subject. He was a minority voice critical of the invasion and accurately predicted it would be a disaster for the Empire.The first book-length biography was published in 2021, Alexandria: The Quest for the Lost City, by Edmund Richardson.", "link_mentions": {}}}
