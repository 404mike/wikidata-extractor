(20 May 1903 \u2013 10 February 1977) was a prominent Slough businessman and politician from the 1940s until his retirement in 1968. He was the managing director for Intertype Ltd., a leading producer of typesetting machines in the United Kingdom from World War II through until the late 1980s. During his life in Slough, he was an alderman for the Conservative Party, and during his later life, he was often encouraged to stand to be an M.P., but refused on the grounds that he could not successfully run a company and be a Member of Parliament. He reached the post of Chairman of the Eton and Slough Conservative Association, a post he held for nearly ten years until his retirement from politics in 1954.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Crowley", "response": ["Philip Crowley may refer to:", "* Philip Crowley (businessman) (1903\u20131977), English businessman", "* Philip Crowley (entomologist) (1837\u20131900), English entomologist"]}]}}
