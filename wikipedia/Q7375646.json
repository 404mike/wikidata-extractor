For instance, there was a mormaer of Mar at the Battle of Clontarf, 1014.\nHe was a witness to a confirmation of lands to the newly established Abbey of the Holy Trinity at Dunfermline, by David I in 1128.He is mentioned as Ruadr\u00ed mormar Marr in the Gaelic notes on the Book of Deer. This means his floruit dates a little after 1130.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mormaer", "response": ["Mormaer (pl. morma\u00edr) and earl were respectively the Gaelic and Scots words used for the position also referred to in Latin as comes (pl. comites), which originally meant \"companion\". That the words mormaer and comes were equivalent can be seen in the case of Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar, who is described as mormaer when listed as a witness in a document recorded in the Gaelic language in 1130 or 1131, and as comes in a charter recorded in Latin between 1127 and 1131. The word earl was increasingly used in place of mormaer as Scots replaced Gaelic as the dominant vernacular language between the late 12th and late 13th centuries, and the word Earl was exclusively used within Scotland to translate comes in the later Middle Ages as Scots became the language of record. This gradual change in language use from Gaelic to Scots did not mean that earl was a new title, however, and it was unrelated to changes in the role of the comes that took place over the same time-period."]}, {"page": "Earl of Mar", "response": ["*Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar (fl. 1130s)"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1110\u20131119", "response": ["|Earl of Mar (1114)||Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar||1114||Abt. 1140||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1120\u20131129", "response": ["|Earl of Mar (1114)||Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar||1115||Abt. 1140||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1130\u20131139", "response": ["|Earl of Mar (1114)||Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar||1115||Abt. 1140||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1140\u20131149", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Earl of Mar (1114)||Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar||1115||Abt. 1140||Died"]}, {"page": "Rothri, 1st Earl of Mar", "response": ["#redirect Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar"]}, {"page": "Ruadr\u00ed of Mar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar"]}, {"page": "Ruadri of Mar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar "]}, {"page": "Ruadri, Earl of Mar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ruadr\u00ed, Earl of Mar "]}]}}
