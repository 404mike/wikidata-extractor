He was later elected to federal parliament, where he served as a government minister under George Reid.\nMcLean was born in Argyll, Scotland, and arrived in Australia as a child. His family settled in the Gippsland region of Victoria, and he eventually acquired a sheep station near Lake Wellington. McLean was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1880 and was promoted to cabinet in 1890, serving under James Munro, William Shiels, and George Turner. He replaced Turner as premier in 1899, but was defeated at the following year's general election. McLean entered the new federal parliament in 1901, as a member of the Protectionist Party. He was a leader of its conservative wing, and in 1904 crossed the floor to become Minister for Trade and Customs in the Reid Government. He was the de facto deputy prime minister. The government was defeated in 1905, and he lost his seat at the 1906 election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 13", "response": ["*1911 \u2013 Allan McLean, Scottish-Australian politician, 19th Premier of Victoria (b. 1840)"]}, {"page": "Premier of Victoria", "response": ["| Allan McLean"]}, {"page": "Protectionist Party", "response": ["On the commencement of the Commonwealth of Australia, Governor-General-designate, The 7th Earl of Hopetoun, appointed Edmund Barton (after the Hopetoun Blunder), leader of the Protectionist Party, to head a caretaker government from 1 January 1901 until the election of a Parliament. At the first federal election in 1901, the Protectionists won 31 of the 75 seats in the House of Representatives. Barton was able to form the Barton minority government with the support of the Labour Party led by Chris Watson, which held the balance of power with 14 seats, on the understanding that the Protectionists would implement a number of social reforms desired by Labour. Labour's program, however, was frequently too radical for many Protectionists, creating internal conflict between those who, like H. B. Higgins, were sympathetic to Labour, while conservatives like Allan McLean preferred to support the Free Trade Party."]}, {"page": "Albert Park, Victoria", "response": ["* Allan McLean (1840\u20131911) \u2013 pastoralist, station agent, politician; Premier of Victoria in 1899; elected to the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901\"McLean, Allan (1840\u20131911)\" Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University"]}, {"page": "Deputy Prime Minister of Australia", "response": ["| Allan McLean"]}, {"page": "James Whiteside McCay", "response": ["On other issues, McCay supported Federation, and was one of a number of young politicians who rallied around Alfred Deakin, threatening to bring down Sir George Turner's government if it attempted to block federation.

In 1899, McCay was one of the young radicals who supported Allan McLean and crossed the floor to bring down the Turner government. McLean gave McCay the portfolio of Minister for Education and Customs in his new ministry. At the time it was the custom for members who had accepted a ministerial appointment to re-submit themselves for election. In the subsequent by-election, McCay's opposition to the war in South Africa became an election issue. The war was now going badly for Britain. Feelings ran high and McCay lost his seat.
