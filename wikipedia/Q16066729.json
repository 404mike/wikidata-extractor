Towards half-time, they had chances from a scramble in front of the Newton Heath goal, and pressed hard after the interval, the persistence of Wheldon eventually securing an equaliser \"after brilliant work by all of the Small Heath forwards\". \"Capital defensive play\" by both teams prevailed thereafter, and the match was drawn. The Manchester Guardian noted the contrast in attacking style, as \"the Small Heath players were playing a most scientific game, but the rushes of Newton Heath were often very dangerous\", and the Gazette's reporter felt that half-backs George Short and, particularly, Jenkyns had been \"inclined to take matters a little too easily\" in the first half."]}]}}
