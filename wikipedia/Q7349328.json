The period of this list is limited to the latter years of Hambledon's existence (i.e., from about 1785) but it indicates the esteem in which Robinson was held as a player.\nThe earliest biographical information about Robinson is provided by Arthur Haygarth.  Haygarth says that Robinson belonged to a farming family. He was at one time a gamekeeper, for James Lawrell.Robinson's success as a cricketer is the more remarkable because he lost two fingers of his right hand when he was a boy.  He had to have special grooves made in his bat handle because of this.\nRobinson played for the Players in the inaugural and second Gentlemen v Players matches in 1806.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Robinson", "response": ["Robert Robinson may refer to:", "*Robert Robinson (Australian politician) (1811\u20131852), Australian politician", "*Robert Robinson (Canadian politician) (1826\u20131885), Canadian merchant and politician in New Brunswick", "*Robert Robinson (cricketer, born 1765) (1765\u20131822), English cricketer", "*Robert Robinson (footballer) (1906\u20131990), English association footballer", "*Robert Robinson (cricketer, born 1924) (1924\u20131973), English cricketer", "*Robert Robinson (rower), New Zealand rower", "*Robert Robinson (painter) (1651\u20131706), English mezzotint engraver, painter, and stage designer, see Johann Jacob Haid", "*Robert Robinson (phonetician) (c. 1600\u2013c. 1660), English phonetician", "*Robert Robinson (Dissenting minister) (1726\u20131791), controversial Unitarian Minister", "*Robert Robinson (Baptist) (1735\u20131790), Baptist Minister and scholar of Cambridge", "*Robert Robinson (chemist) (1886\u20131975), British chemist, Nobel laureate", "*Robert Robinson (engineer) (1907\u20131994), lived in the Soviet Union", "*Robert Robinson (broadcaster) (1927\u20132011), British broadcaster", "*Robert Robinson (Neighbours), fictional character in 2006\u20132007"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket (1816\u20131863)", "response": ["Changes in fashion affected the sport and a reaction to the virility cult espoused by Beauclerk and his ilk brought about the introduction of safer equipment such as padded leg-guards and padded gloves.
