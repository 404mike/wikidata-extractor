Blythe was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1904 and took more than 2,500 first-class wickets over the course of his career, one of only 13 men to have done so.\nBlythe was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler and is considered to have been one of the great left-arm spin bowlers in cricket history. He played county cricket for Kent County Cricket Club between 1899 and 1914 and shares the record for the highest number of first-class wickets taken in a single day's play. He took over 100 wickets in 14 of the 16 seasons he played, including 215 in 1909.\nDespite suffering from epilepsy, Blyth enlisted in the British army at the beginning of World War I. He was killed during the Second Battle of Passchendaele whilst on active service. A memorial at Kent's home ground, the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, is dedicated to him and to other members of the club who died in the war.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 30", "response": ["*1879 \u2013 Colin Blythe, English cricketer and soldier (d. 1917)"]}, {"page": "November 8", "response": ["*1917 \u2013 Colin Blythe, English cricketer and soldier (b. 1879)"]}, {"page": "1917", "response": ["* November 8 \u2013 Colin Blythe, English cricketer (b. 1879)"]}, {"page": "1900s (decade)", "response": ["*Colin Blythe"]}, {"page": "1903 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Colin Blythe, John Gunn, Albert Knight, Walter Mead, Plum Warner"]}, {"page": "1908 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Colin Blythe 197 @ 16.88 (BB 8\u201383)"]}, {"page": "1909 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Colin Blythe 215 @ 14.54 (BB 9\u201342)"]}, {"page": "1912 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Colin Blythe 178 @ 12.26 (BB 8\u201336)"]}, {"page": "1914 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Colin Blythe 170 @ 15.19 (BB 9\u201397)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Colin Blythe"]}, {"page": "County Championship", "response": ["| align=\"center\" | Colin Blythe"]}, {"page": "South Africa national cricket team", "response": ["In 1906, England made a reciprocal tour to South Africa, which this time consisted of a 5-match official Test series. The touring English team was a second-string team, with only Colin Blythe, Schofield Haigh and JN Crawford being those who could be considered regulars of the England team. Nevertheless, South Africa was still not favouriting going into the series. However, in a shocking result at Johannesburg, the inspired South Africans, led by Sherwell and their googly quartet, defeated England by 1 wicket, thereby recording her first Test win. Schwarz, Vogler, and Faulkner led the way for South Africa. Afterwards, South Africa defeated England by 9 wickets in the 2nd Test at Johannesburg, a 243-run win in the 3rd test at the same venue as well as an innings-and-16 runs victory at Cape Town in the 5th Test to secure a 4\u20131 domination of England. Schwarz picked up 18 in the series at 17.22, Faulkner 14 at 19.42. However, Vogler was not so successful with 9 wickets at 22.33. The series is widely recognised as the one which heralded the arrival of South Africa as a major force on the international cricket scene. The MCC duly complied by inviting the South African team to tour England in 1907 for the first time to play-official Tests. Though the series finished 1\u20130 to England with two draws, the quartet of Schwarz, Faulkner, Vogler, and White were praised for their exceptional quality of googly bowling, and Schwarz and Vogler came to be recognised as  Wisden Cricketers of the Year the following year \u2013 the first South Africans to win the prestigious award."]}, {"page": "Bill Voce", "response": ["Voce made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire against Gloucestershire in 1927. A few good performances saw him keep his place despite the strength and variety of Nottinghamshire's bowling. At this stage, he was a classical left-arm spinner and some critics viewed him as a successor to Colin Blythe. Thus, when he changed to a faster pace the following year there was a good deal of criticism, but, in 1929, Voce returned to his slower style with great success in a number of games on sticky wickets, notably against Northamptonshire when he took fourteen wickets for 43 runs."]}, {"page": "Sydney Barnes", "response": ["Barnes was a great success in Australia but his participation was cut short by a knee injury. He played against three state teams before making his Test debut against Australia on 13 December 1901 at Sydney Cricket Ground, where he took five for 65 in the first innings. Also making their debuts in this Test were Colin Blythe and Len Braund. Between them, the three debutant bowlers took all twenty Australian wickets as England won by an innings and 124 runs. Australia levelled the series in the second Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, winning by 229 runs although Barnes had figures of six for 42 and seven for 121. Monty Noble trumped Barnes' effort with seven for 17 and six for 60. Although successful, taking nineteen wickets in the two Tests to add to the thirteen in his previous seven first-class matches, Barnes was over-bowled. He injured a knee in the third Test at Adelaide Oval and missed the remainder of the tour.

Barnes bowled with great success; Colin Blythe and Len Braund, like Barnes chosen by MacLaren and making their Test debuts, performed effectively and England won by an innings.Down (1981), pp. 73\u201374. The remaining four Tests were lost as the team suffered from a lack of effective bowlers. MacLaren severely overbowled Barnes, who took 13 wickets, in the second Test; the bowler was injured in the next game and took no further part on the tour.Down (1981), pp. 74\u201376. MacLaren was successful with the bat. He scored 92 in the fourth Test, made centuries in the two first-class games played in between the Test matches, and finished top of the batting averages. Critics judged that his team had performed well despite the heavy defeat, and his captaincy attracted praise.Down (1981), pp. 77\u201379. In addition, the team were considered to be the best fielding side to visit Australia. In the Test series, MacLaren scored 412 runs at 45.77, while in all first-class matches he hit 929 runs at 58.06.", "The England selectors made several changes to the team for the second Test. Colin Blythe, a crucial bowler to the team, withdrew before the game. Other players were left out whom most commentators believed should have played, and the bowling attack was packed with medium-paced bowlers of a similar style.Down (1981), pp. 119\u201320. The report in Wisden suggested: \"Never in the history of Test Matches in England has there been such blundering in the selection of an England eleven\". The selectors later implied the controversial choices were at the behest of MacLaren, although other evidence suggests that MacLaren did not get the team he requested.Down (1981), p. 120. England lost the game; MacLaren's reputation suffered and commentators began to blame him for the defeat. He offered his resignation, but the selectors retained him as captain and restored some of the players omitted from the second Test.Down (1981), p. 121. When England lost the third Test after the batsmen failed, not helped by MacLaren's poor form, critics questioned his place in the team.Down (1981), p. 122. MacLaren tried to excuse his position, suggesting in the press that he knew the team would struggle and played \"in spite of my personal wishes\". He also implied that the team's selection was out of his hands.

In 1907, Rhodes scored fewer runs and increased his bowling aggregate, securing 173 wickets in a wet season. Wisden believed his greater bowling success was due to a reduced batting contribution, but he still completed the double by scoring 1,045 runs.Thomson, p. 125. During that season, Rhodes was again asked to open the batting for Yorkshire and he was chosen as the permanent replacement for John Tunnicliffe as Yorkshire's opening batsman. Several batsmen had been tried in the position,Thomson, p. 126. but Rhodes's superior defensive technique with the bat secured him the role.Hodgson, p. 70.

After England established a first innings lead, Australia were bowled out for 151 in their second innings, with Hirst taking five for 58. The English opening batsmen scored the 105 runs required for victory without being separated. Hirst and Blythe took all the wickets which fell to England in the match, a rare accomplishment, and apart from a brief period, bowled throughout the match without resting. However, Hirst was ineffective in the rest of the series, and was left out of the side for the fifth and final Test.Ellam, p. 83.

He used \"cunning flighting\" and \"the ability to turn the ball sharply\" to be an effective bowler \"even on good pitches\" and could be \"unplayable\" on helpful pitches.
