Blythe was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1904 and took more than 2,000 first-class wickets over the course of his career, one of only 33 men to have done so.\nBlythe was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler and is considered to have been one of the great left-arm spin bowlers in cricket history. He played county cricket for Kent County Cricket Club between 1899 and 1914 and shares the world record for the highest number of first-class wickets taken in a single day's play.\nBlythe was killed during the Second Battle of Passchendaele whilst on active service with the British Army during World War I, having enlisted in the armed forces at the outbreak of war despite suffering from epilepsy. A memorial at Kent's home ground, the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, is dedicated to Blythe and to other members of the club who died on active service in the war.", "link_mentions": {}}}
