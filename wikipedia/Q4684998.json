The island's parliament, Tynwald, agreed to spend nearly \u00a35 million for track replacement in July\u2013September, allowing trams to run on a single track, according to a news report. Manx authorities were considering vintage buses as a replacement during the closure, reports previously stated. The resignation of the Tourism and Leisure Minister Adrian Earnshaw was called for by enthusiasts, and Chief Minister Tony Brown ordered an urgent review of the closure decision. He also ordered an independent inquiry into how the track had been allowed to get into such a state. In 2009 the full line operated continuously, and it has continued to do so during the summer season since the beginning of the 2010 season at Easter, except for COVID-related suspension, with no rail-related incidents affecting services. Until 1998 the line operated a year-round service, but since then it has run seasonally, usually between March and the beginning of November, though the dates can vary from season to season."]}, {"page": "Isle of Man Railway", "response": ["After Howard resigned, the Department of Tourism and Leisure's Director of Leisure, Mike Ball, stepped in as acting director of public transport, and in early 2007 the leisure and public transport divisions of the department combined into \"service delivery\", Ball becoming \"Director of service delivery\" under the minister Adrian Earnshaw appointed in November 2006. Ian Longworth was appointed Director of Public Transport in 2009 and since then the railway has become part of the Department of Community, Culture and Leisure.  A number of new services have been introduced since the arrival of the new director, including evening excursion trains, a Rush Hour event at the start of each season, and family-oriented events including a \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\" and \"Fathers' Day\" specials. A restoration programme for the unique collection of rolling stock and locomotives is ongoing; this has seen most recently two saloon-type coaches completely rebuilt and back in traffic; at least three more coaches are to be restored, one of which has been out of traffic for nearly half a century."]}, {"page": "Council of Ministers of the Isle of Man", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" | David Cretney MHK || rowspan=\"2\" | Allan Bell MHK || rowspan=\"2\" | Eddie Teare MHK || rowspan=\"2\" |John Shimmin MHK || rowspan=\"2\" | Adrian Earnshaw MHK || rowspan=\"2\" |Phil Gawne MHK || rowspan=\"2\" | Martyn Quayle MHK || rowspan=\"2\" | Anne Craine MHK", "| rowspan=\"2\" |Tony Brown MHK|| rowspan=\"3\" |Phil Gawne MHK || rowspan=\"2\" |Anne Craine MHK || rowspan=\"2\" | Eddie Teare MHK || Adrian Earnshaw MHK || rowspan=\"2\" | John Shimmin MHK || rowspan=\"2\" |David Cretney MHK || rowspan=\"2\" |David Anderson MHK || rowspan=\"6\" | Allan Bell MHK || Martyn Quayle MHK", "|Martyn Quayle MHK|| Adrian Earnshaw MHK"]}, {"page": "2001 Manx general election", "response": ["| Adrian Earnshaw MHK || None || 1,929"]}, {"page": "Tony Brown (Manx politician)", "response": ["|Adrian Earnshaw ", "|Adrian Earnshaw"]}, {"page": "Geoff Cannell", "response": ["In 1998 he was elected the MHK for Onchan, following Ray Kniveton's elevation to the Legislative Council.
