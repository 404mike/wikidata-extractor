Following the report, Patel commented: \"This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn't this point been pressed home during negotiations?\" Some sections of the media reported her comments as a suggestion that Britain should exploit Ireland's fear of damage to its economy and food shortages to advance its position with the EU. She was criticised for insensitivity by several other MPs in the light of Britain's part in Ireland's Great Famine in the 19th century, in which a million people died. Patel said her comments had been taken out of context. Journalist Eilis O'Hanlon criticised the media's characterisation of Patel's comments as a \"manipulative, sinister media-manufactured campaign of character assassination\", further elaborating that the \"divide between fact and comment broke down entirely in response to Priti Patel's comments\"."]}, {"page": "Disappearance of Madeleine McCann", "response": ["Eilis O'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\".Eilis O'Hanlon, \"Eilis O'Hanlon: The sad rise of cyber courts full of Twittering bullies\", Sunday Independent (Ireland), 29 April 2012.
