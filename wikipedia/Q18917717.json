He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1831, and he contributed several original and elaborate papers to its Transactions. He also published Researches on Terrestrial Magnetism in the Philosophical Transactions, Determination of the Law of Resistance to a Projectile in the Mechanics' Magazine, and other papers in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, the Civil Engineer, the Athen\u00e6um, the Westminster Review, and Notes and Queries."]}, {"page": "George Lewis Scott", "response": ["It is suggested he studied under the French Huguenot mathematician, Abraham De Moivre, who lived in London for many years. He was certainly regarded as an expert in the field, as shown by his appointment to the Board of Longitude in the 1760s. Through his mother, he was distantly related to William Trail (1746-1831), Chair of Mathematics at Marischal College from 1767 to 1779 and the two were frequent correspondents. The mathematician Robert Simson was another friend; some of their letters were printed in Trail's Life of Simson."]}, {"page": "Trail, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Trail"]}]}}
