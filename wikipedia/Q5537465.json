He played in three first-class matches without making much impact, but one of his games was a remarkable victory for Somerset over a strong Yorkshire side in July 1901, in which Somerset trailed by 238 on the first innings but then made 630 in the second innings to win the match by 279 runs; Burrington contributed 11 to the first innings of 87 and 15, his highest first-class score, to the 630.Burrington's club cricket was for Bridgwater Cricket Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tiverton, Devon", "response": ["*George Burrington (1864\u20131942), first-class cricketer, was born in Tiverton."]}, {"page": "George Burrington", "response": ["George Burrington (ca. 1682 \u2013 22 February 1759) was a British colonial official who served as the Governor of the Province of North Carolina from 1724 to 1725 and 1731 to 1734.

The register of Sampford Courtenay, recorded the baptism of a George Burrington on 14 November 1685. His parents were listed as John and Mary Burrington. John Burrington was the son of Gilbert Burrington. Notwithstanding his rough exterior, George Burrington seems to have been a man of education; and the sale of his books shows that he was not unprovided with literature at a time when libraries were few and scattered. His last will and testament is dated 8 December 1750. He was killed during an apparent robbery attempt in Westminster's St James's Park, 22 February 1759, and buried at St. John the Evangelist two days later."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* George Burrington (1901\u20131902) 3 matches CA"]}]}}
