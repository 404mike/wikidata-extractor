With the navigation thriving, there were two proposals for canals from Ipswich to Eye, Suffolk in 1819. A meeting was held in January at Eye, which was chaired by Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis. It considered two reports, one proposed by the civil engineer William Cubitt, which involved a tunnel through the hills at Mendlesham, with the estimated cost exceeding \u00a3100,000, and another, for a canal over the hills, costing \u00a380,000. Both were thought to be too expensive to implement, but a third proposal emerged, for an extension from the River Gipping at Needham Market, which would follow the valley of a tributary through Creeting St Mary to Earl Stonham, where a basin would be built beside the turnpike road (now the A140 road). This would enable waggons to make a round trip from Eye in a single day, rather than the two days that a trip to Ipswich took. The scheme was estimated to cost \u00a312,000, and shares in it were offered at the meeting. Although many were taken up, the scheme did not advance any further."]}, {"page": "Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans", "response": ["Lord St Germans married Lady Jemima Cornwallis (24 December 1803, Brome, Suffolk \u2013 2 July 1856, Dover Street, LondonGRO Register of Deaths:SEP 1856 1a 135 ST GEO HAN SQ \u2013 Jemima Eliot, age unknown), daughter of Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis, at St James Church, Westminster, on 2 September 1824.
