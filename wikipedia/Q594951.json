Following his debut, Mills started each of Nottingham Forest's first eight matches of the season, scoring twice, before an injury sustained shortly after equalizing against Middlesbrough on 19 September 2015, forcing him to miss the club's next away match Huddersfield Town. He returned to the starting eleven in Nottingham Forest's next game at home to Hull City on 3 October 2015, but received a straight red card from referee Nigel Miller in the 87th minute of the game following an aerial challenge with Hull's on-loan Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom, as the club lost the game 1\u20130. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the starting line\u2013up as captain against Sheffield Wednesday on 31 October 2015, as Nottingham Forest lost 1\u20130.

After this he also went on to score in a 3\u20131 defeat away at Barnsley on 16 October and a 1\u20130 home win over Middlesbrough three days later. This left him as the club's top-scorer despite only starting seven matches; teammate Chris Cohen said that \"Lewis has made himself more versatile this season and has been fantastic so far. If it wasn't for his goals at the moment we'd be in a lot of trouble\". On 23 October, McGugan continued his fine goal-scoring form with a \"superb long-range free-kick\" against Ipswich Town; this would later be voted as the Championship Goal of the Season. Speaking on his good form he stated that \"I've worked hard in the summer, made sure I had a good pre-season and waited for my chance. And I've taken it\". His impressive form and spectacular long range efforts were seen again on 6 November when he scored from 25 yards to secure a 1\u20131 draw at Watford. On 20 November, McGugan added to his great start to the season with the opening goal and assist for the second in a 2\u20130 win at Cardiff City, who were the league leaders at the time.

As was the case with his predecessor, McClaren repeatedly called for the club to show greater ambition in signing new players, including \"stellar\" signings which would take his squad to the next level, especially since the club had seen 9 players leave in the off-season. Despite these concerns, the transfer window closed with only 5 new additions. After an injury to Chris Cohen, Clint Hill was signed on loan from Queen's Park Rangers, but other loan targets identified by McClaren were not pursued. After a 5\u20131 defeat away to Burnley, McClaren held emergency talks with the club chairman, Nigel Doughty. The result of the meeting was the departure of David Pleat as a club adviser. Pleat had drawn the ire of many fans because of his role in the club's acquisition committee, and rightly or wrongly, it was assumed he had been obstructionist and advised the club not to make expensive new signings. The departure of Pleat, which was also accompanied by the departure of Bill Beswick, was viewed as a sign the club were behind McClaren. However, less than a week later McClaren resigned from his role as manager on 2 October 2011 after a 3\u20131 home defeat to Birmingham City. Forest held a 1\u20130 lead for much of the game before eventually falling apart after Birmingham scored the equaliser. McClaren's disappointment with the lack of new signings was assumed to be behind the reason for his departure, and he left the club without compensation. Nigel Doughty also announced he would resign from his role as chairman at the end of the season, though it was stated he would continue to support the club financially. Doughty had also become an unpopular figure with some supporters since his lack of financial backing for McClaren and his predecessor appeared to be tied to his concerns over financial fair play rules that were to be adopted in the Championship in the near future. A new search for manager and chairman began immediately with the names of former players Nigel Clough, Roy Keane, and Martin O'Neill, among others, being touted by betting agencies to take over the vacant managerial position."]}]}}
