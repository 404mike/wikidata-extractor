He spent a year in Iceland, training for mountain and Arctic warfare, and drove his machine-gun carrier on to the beach in Normandy in 1944. According to the New York Times, Davies made his first airplane trip in 1948. Subsequently, he worked for the Ministry of Civil Aviation, British European Airways, the Bristol Aeroplane Company and de Havilland before moving to the United States in 1968 to lead market research for Douglas Aircraft. A lifelong aviation enthusiast, Davies dedicated his work to different aspects of the airline industry, including traffic forecasting, and specializing in its history. He researched airlines at the National Air and Space Museum as the Charles A. Lindbergh Chair in Aerospace History in 1981\u20131982.\nDavies was responsible, alongside artist Mike Machat, for the book series An Airline and its Aircraft, about selected airlines' histories, including the types flown. His writing led him to found Paladwr Press, which published 38 books of classic airline histories and biographies.\nWell travelled to more than a hundred countries (including all seven continents), Davies was a member of three British Royal Societies, the Explorers Club, and others in France and Brazil. He enjoyed a 30-year career as the Curator of Air Transport at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, at an age when most men are retired, and continued to write and publish airline history throughout that time. He played a leading role in the Washington Airline Society, lectured widely across the US and beyond, and provided constant assistance to airline researchers. His 25th book - and swan song -  Airlines of the Jet Age: A History  (for the Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press) was published in July 2011, just before he died aged 90.\nAfter his long (over 60 years) career in aviation, Ron Davies returned to England to live in his Hertfordshire home with his wife, Marjorie, and be near his two daughters and two grandsons. As well as his lifelong interest in aviation, Ron enjoyed traditional jazz, wrote one novel, and had hoped to write a book about his home town of Shaftesbury during his retirement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Continental Airlines", "response": ["Continental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era that provided very fine, almost fancy, service against the larger majors in important point-to-point markets, the largest of which was Chicago/Los Angeles.
