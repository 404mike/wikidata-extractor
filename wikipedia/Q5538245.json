He made his first-class debut three years later for Worcestershire against Hampshire, scoring 78 in the first innings; this was to remain his highest first-class score, and indeed he made only one more fifty: 56 against the same opponents in 1909. He took only two wickets, one being that of Test player Charlie McGahey.\nIn retirement Crowe served for many years as a master at Bromley County Grammar School; he died at the age of 91 in that town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Crowe (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Crowe (1921\u20132011) was an American baseball and basketball player.", "George Crowe may also refer to:", "*George Crowe (cricketer) (1885\u20131976), English cricketer", "*George Crowe (ice hockey) (1936\u20132019), Canadian ice hockey coach", "*George Crowe (1841\u20131889), husband of actress Kate Bateman"]}]}}
