Bradd finished as top scorer a further two times, in 1975/76 and 1976/77, though the last of these was jointly held with Mick Vinter. During this period the club embarked on another notable League Cup run in 1975/76, again reaching the Quarter Finals and knocking out Sunderland, Leeds and Everton on the way. The defeat of Everton came in a 2-1 Replay victory at Meadow Lane in which Bradd scored twice in arguably his finest County performance."]}, {"page": "List of Oxford United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Mick Vinter"]}, {"page": "List of Notts County F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Mick Vinter", "|align=left| Mick Vinter", "|align=left| Mick Vinter"]}]}}
