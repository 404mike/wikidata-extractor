Following an abject performance against Stoke City in the League Cup, in which Swindon won 4\u20133, he was substituted for Leigh Bedwell in the very next game after twenty-one minutes, with Swindon two goals down. Foderingham reacted angrily to his substitution; kicking a water bottle as he left the pitch and refusing to acknowledge his manager. Manager Di Canio then publicly criticised Foderingham after the game and claimed that if he did not apologise for his actions, he would be 'out' of the club. Foderingham later issued an apology, which was accepted by Di Canio."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["* 17 May 2013: The club confirm that the club had taken up contract options on Leigh Bedwell, Aden Flint, Miles Storey and Nathan Thompson.", "| Leigh Bedwell", "| Leigh Bedwell"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["*3 May 2014: Development players Aaron Oakley, Kayden Jackson, Leigh Bedwell, Mark Francis and Alex Ferguson are also released by the club.", "| Leigh Bedwell"]}]}}
