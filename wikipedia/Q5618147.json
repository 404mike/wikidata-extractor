He had a long history of liberalism, and had discussed his ideas and intentions with Victoria and others before his reign. Admiring Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the British parliamentary system,Dorpalen, p. 3. Frederick and his wife planned to rule as co-monarchs and liberalize Germany through the appointment of more liberal ministers.Farago, p. 264. They intended to severely limit the office of Chancellor, and reorganize Germany to include many elements of British liberalism. Many historians, including William Harbutt Dawson and Erich Eyck, consider that Frederick's early death put an end to the development of liberalism within the German Empire. They believe that, given a longer reign and better health, Frederick might indeed have transformed Germany into a more liberal democratic country, and prevented its militaristic path toward war.Chalat, p. 1307.McCullough, p. 403. Dr. J. McCullough claims that Frederick would have averted World War I\u2014and by extension the resulting Weimar Republic\u2014while other historians such as Michael Balfour go even further by postulating that, as the end of World War I directly affected the state of the world's development, the liberal German Emperor might also have prevented the outbreak of World War II.Balfour, p. v. Author Michael Freund states outright that both world wars would have been averted had Frederick lived longer.Freund, p. 9.  Frederick's life inspired historian Frank Tipton to speculate: \"What would have happened had his father died sooner or if he himself had lived longer?\"Tipton, p. 176."]}, {"page": "William Dawson", "response": ["* William Harbutt Dawson (1860\u20131948), British writer"]}, {"page": "State Socialism (Germany)", "response": ["In spite of its name, State Socialism was a conservative ideology which supported the aristocracy, the church and the monarchy while maintaining harmony with capitalists and workers, in opposition to both liberalism and socialism. Hence, its supporters called themselves the Conservative Party while its opponents called themselves the National Liberal Party and the Socialist Workers' Party. Historian Alexander Nove argued that social ownership through government can only occur if the government is socially controlled which was not the case where an emperor rules by the will of God as in Germany since the Emperor was not the public. Nove's definition of social ownership, a common characteristic that accomunates types of socialism,O'Hara, Phillip (2003). Encyclopedia of Political Economy. 2. London: Routledge. p. 71. . \"In order of increasing decentralization (at least) three forms of socialized ownership can be distinguished: state-owned firms, employee-owned (or socially) owned firms, and citizen ownership of equity.\" refers to \"the major part of means of production\",Nove, Alexander (2008). \"Socialism\". New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics (2nd ed.). London: Palgrave Macmillan UK. . but this remained in private hands under State Socialism. In \"Why I Am Not a Conservative\", Friedrich Hayek explained that \"[t]here are, however, two economic and philosophical estimates of society with which State Socialism may be brought into broad contrast\", namely liberalism and socialism.Hayek, Friedrich; Hamowy, Ronald, ed. (2011) [1960]. \"Why I am Not a Conservative\". The Constitution of Liberty: The Definitive Edition. Chicago: Chicago University Press. pp. 1\u20132. . According to journalist William Harbutt Dawson, an acknowledged expert on German politics and society, \"[t]he great disagreement between Socialism and State Socialism is that the former would entirely subvert the State, while the latter accepts its political form as it is. Socialism would abolish the existing order altogether, while State Socialism would use the State for the accomplishment of great economic and social purposes, especially restoring to it the function, which Frederick the Great held to be the principal business of the State, of 'holding the balance [...] between classes and parties\".", "According to William Harbutt Dawson, despite being labeled socialist by his opponents, Bismarck's social legislation sought to preserve the existing economic order and state in Germany. This was in stark contrast to socialists, who sought to subvert the power of the existing state and eventually replace the capitalist order with a socialist economy.Dawson, William Harbutt (1891).
