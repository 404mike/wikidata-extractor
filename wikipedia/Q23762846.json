They felt a documentary should be made that would show the reality of life as a student at Oxford rather than the clich\u00e9d image seen in shows such as Brideshead Revisited. It was felt that choosing St Hilda's would be of additional interest as it would allow \"an examination of women at the beginning of the 21st century\". The college was in the news due to controversial votes by the fellows as to whether it should retain its single-sex status. The college were concerned for the welfare of students involved in the project, and also feared that they may not be treated fairly by media coverage without any editorial control, but with the support of college fellow Sally Mapstone, permission was granted. The Channel 4 documentary team were allowed access to the college for up to 40 days per year.\"The belles of St Hilda's reveal all.\" The Daily Telegraph. 7 October 2002. Retrieved 25 February 2007.", "Channel 4 were heavily criticised for their decision not to transmit the fifth episode, which discussed with the students' sexualities and the latest poll on whether to admit male students and academics. Peter Dale, head of documentaries, denied that the decision was ratings-related, he said the episode was dropped because it was \"a little bit pretentious\" and felt the series may not have been delivering what the audience wanted. College principal Lady English said that the college was not informed of the decision prior to the series' end and felt the broadcaster owed the college and the film's participants \"an explanation and an apology\". She also suggested that the channel should have voiced their complaints about the fifth episode during editing, and not once the broadcast of the series was underway. Ruth Hunt discussed her sexuality on camera in the untransmitted episode and wrote to Channel 4 expressing her \"hurt and disappointment\" over the handling of the episode. Sally Mapstone felt that the episode that was skipped was key to the story, commenting \"the irony is that, by censoring the one film where the girls talk most frankly about themselves, Channel 4 has skewed the whole emphasis of the series\".", "Sally Mapstone also said she feared the series's cancellation was a response to the public perception of Oxford as elitist. Kevin Sim added that he felt that critics of the series were using the show as an excuse to \"express their long-cherished hatred of Oxford as an elitist institution\". He said it was brave of the network to invest in the series in 1998 but should have publicised it more."]}, {"page": "Vyners School", "response": ["* Prof Sally Mapstone Academic & Principal of St Andrews University (2016 - )"]}, {"page": "John Burrell (poet)", "response": ["In 1601 Francis Mowbray wrote to Sir Robert Cecil from Edinburgh complaining about John Burrell who was in London and had ridiculed him in verse and had a sonnet against him published.
