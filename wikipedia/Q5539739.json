Gladwin (born 28 March 1907) was an English footballer. His regular position was at right-half or inside forward.

Having already lost the captaincy to George Roughton in 1937, Brown lost his place in the team to George Gladwin at the start of the 1938\u201339 season, before Jack Warner took over in November 1938, having been signed the previous summer. This meant that Brown made just three appearances for Manchester United in 1938\u201339 and he was allowed to leave for Bradford Park Avenue in February 1939. He made 13 appearances for Bradford Park Avenue before the end of the season and another in 1939\u201340 before league football was suspended due to the Second World War, during which he retired from football."]}, {"page": "Gladwin, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Gladwin"]}]}}
