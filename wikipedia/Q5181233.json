Darlington's Craig Liddle brought James Coppinger down with a professional foul in the fifth minute but was only shown a yellow card.  Half an hour later Liddle put his side ahead with a volley.  Hartlepool United's Craig Midgley went close after taking the ball round Darlington's goalkeeper Andy Collett but his shot was wide.  With a quarter of an hour to go, second-half substitute Glenn Naylor was brought down by Hartlepool's goalkeeper Martin Hollund who  was sent off. Marco Gabbiadini converted the subsequent penalty past Andy Dibble, and the match ended 2\u20130.  The second leg of the semi-final was held four days later at Feethams in Darlington.  In front of their largest crowd for nine years, the home side took the lead in the ninth minute when Hartlepool defender Gary Strodder headed a cross from Darlington's Phil Brumwell into his own net for an own goal.  Peter Duffield hit the Hartlepool crossbar five minutes later and Chris Freestone's headed goal in the 71st minute for the visitors was disallowed.  The match ended 1\u20130 and Darlington progressed  with a 3\u20130 aggregate win."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Craig Midgley"]}, {"page": "Midgley (surname)", "response": ["*Craig Midgley (born 1976), English football manager and former player"]}]}}
