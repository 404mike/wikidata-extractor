A consequence of this strictly alphabetical procedure, though, is that related forms of the same word, or word-family, are scattered throughout the dictionary. Thus, in a sense, Cregeen\u2019s Dictionary as published is more like an index to a lexicon than a lexicon itself.It is worth noting that Cregeen was not the first person to attempt to write a dictionary for the Manx language. Reverend John Kelly had attempted to do so in his A Triglot Dictionary of the Celtic Language, as spoken in Man, Scotland, and Ireland together with the English, but much of this was destroyed in a fire during publishing.
