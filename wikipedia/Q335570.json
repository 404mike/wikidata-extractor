After failing to sell Atherton Hall which was less than a century old, it was demolished in 1824, with some of the furniture and carpets being sent to Bewsey.  They later demolished the eighteenth century wing and in  1860-61 a new half-timbered house (Bewsey New Hall) was built on a different site west of Camp Road for Thomas Powys, 4th Baron Lilford as a replacement for the Old Hall, with the original hall being converted into two farmhouses and let to tenants. The new building was almost certainly designed by W.G. Habershon, but Lady Lilford disliked the house so much that she refused to live in it and it was largely demolished in the 1940s, apart from a fragment of the west wing."]}, {"page": "Thomas Powys", "response": ["* Thomas Powys, 4th Baron Lilford (1833\u20131896), British aristocrat and ornithologist"]}, {"page": "Edward Peter Mathers", "response": ["In Durban on 6 August 1885 Mathers married Mary Augusta Powys, a daughter of R.
