He found few opportunities to break into the first team as the Saints struggled near the foot of the Southern League First Division and was used as cover for Jim McAlpine.

After four matches, McAlpine was recalled and Hadley switched to right-half where he remained until February when he lost his place to Jack Small.

He returned to the side in December when he replaced Charles Tyson at centre-half for five matches, followed by two matches at inside-left.
