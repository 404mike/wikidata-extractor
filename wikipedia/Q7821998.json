He was sold to Blackpool in August 1996 for \u00a3225,000, before he was moved on to Port Vale for a \u00a3115,000 fee in March 1999. He then joined West Bromwich Albion in March 2000 for \u00a3140,000, and helped the \"Baggies\" to promotion out of the First Division in 2001\u201302. Following this he was allowed to sign with Bristol City, and he helped his new side to the League Trophy in 2003. He returned to Blackpool in February 2005, before he signed with Conference club Forest Green Rovers in July 2006.

This spending spree set the club back \u00a3630,000, and so Horton first sold off Peter Beadle to Notts County for \u00a3250,000 in order to raise the cash needed for his new signings.

To replace these players, Horton signed three players on free transfers: Jeff Minton from former club Brighton, Tommy Widdrington from Grimsby Town, and Steve Rimmer from Manchester City. As the season progressed he released Marcus Bent, and sold Carl Griffiths back to Leyton Orient for \u00a3100,000.
