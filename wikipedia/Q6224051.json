The team competed in the amateur leagues before gaining entry into the Southern Football League and turning professional in 1910. With growing interest in association football in the traditionally rugby union stronghold of Swansea, the decision was taken to form a club. Swansea Town A.F.C. was founded in 1912 and gained admission into the Second Division of the Southern Football League alongside Cardiff. The two clubs faced each other for the first time on 7 September 1912, in Swansea's first competitive fixture, with the match ending in a 1\u20131 draw; Billy Ball gave the Swans the lead before Cardiff captain John Burton equalised. Swansea went on to claim the first victory between the two sides five months later when they defeated Cardiff 4\u20132 in the semi-final of the Welsh Cup despite trailing 2\u20130 at half time. Cardiff lost two players to injury in the second half in a time when substitutes were not permitted, ending the match with nine players. Such was the friendliness between the two sides in the early meetings that when Burton scored a bicycle kick in the match, several of his opponents stopped to shake hands with him in appreciation of the goal."]}, {"page": "Fred Stewart (football manager)", "response": ["Stewart quickly began reshaping the squad and released all but four of the players he inherited from McDougall. His first signing was one of his former Stockport players, Billy Hardy, who would go on to be a lynchpin of the side during the club's success under Stewart. Due to the financial plight of the club at the time, Stewart paid Hardy's \u00a325 transfer fee with his own money, although he was later reimbursed when the financial position improved. Among his early signings were Arthur Waters from his former club and brothers George and John Burton, while George Latham was appointed as a player-coach. Latham would remain in the role for 20 years and was instrumental in assisting Stewart during his period with the club. Stewart's first match in charge of his new side ended in a 3\u20131 victory over Kettering in the opening game of the 1911\u201312 season."]}, {"page": "John Henry Burton", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Burton (footballer, born 1885)"]}, {"page": "John Burton (footballer born 1885)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Burton (footballer, born 1885)"]}, {"page": "George West (footballer)", "response": ["Born in Wardley, West was playing for Wallsend when he was spotted by Cardiff City manager Fred Stewart who was in the process of building a side following the club's decision to become fully professional three years earlier. Signed as a replacement for John Burton, West adapted quickly to the Southern Football League, finishing as the club's top scorer for two consecutive seasons between 1913 and 1915. His spell with the club was interrupted due to the outbreak of World War I but he returned to Ninian Park following the return of league football in 1919, scoring both goals in a 2\u20131 victory over Wrexham during the 1920 Welsh Cup final, and remained with the club following their move into the Football League in 1920. After missing just two matches in the Second Division in the opening five months of the 1920\u201321 season, West eventually lost his place in the first-team to Harry Nash and made just one further appearance during the season as the club achieved promotion to the First Division. He remained with the club at the start of the following season, again competing with Nash, but the arrival of Joe Clennell from Everton in October 1921 saw him fall further out of favour and he soon left the club to join Stockport County where he finished his professional career, making three league appearances for the side."]}]}}
