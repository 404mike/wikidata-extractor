The information revolution has resulted in over-abundant data that are critical in a wide range of areas, from the Internet to healthcare systems. Related to conceptual art, electronic art and new media art, informatism considers this new technological, economical, and cultural paradigm shift, such that artworks may provide social commentaries, synthesize multiple disciplines, and develop new aesthetics. Realization of information art often take, although not necessarily, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches incorporating visual, audio, data analysis, performance, and others.Edward A. Shanken has argued that little scholarship has explored the relationship between technology and conceptual art. He also claimed that there was an art-historical impetus to artificially distinguish information art from conceptual art. Edward A.
