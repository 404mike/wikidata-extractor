He was highly regarded for his scholarly writings on medical history but was widely denounced for disputing the germ theory of infectious diseases.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Smallpox vaccine", "response": ["Until the end of the 19th century, vaccination was performed either directly with vaccine produced on the skin of calves or, particularly in England, with vaccine obtained from the calf but then maintained by arm-to-arm transfer; initially in both cases vaccine could be dried on ivory points for short-term storage or transport but increasing use was made of glass capillary tubes for this purpose towards the end of the century. During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas, tetanus, septicaemia and tuberculosis. In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations,Bazin 2000 p. 122. some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. Smallpox vaccine was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century."]}, {"page": "Eyam", "response": ["For over a century there have been those who have questioned the details of the story of Eyam's response to the plague and the wisdom of the actors in it. The reviewer of The Tale of Eyam in the British Medical Journal for 30 November 1889 dismissed its poetic religiosity: \"The author speaks of the pestilence and its hellborn brood; and again of firebolts from heaven's reeking nostrils. Such phraseology aptly exemplifies the mental attitude of men who lived in the infancy of modern science, when in the plague they saw the angry stroke of offended Deity, and recognised the 'scourge' of God in what we know to be only the scourge of filth.' Shortly afterwards, writing in his A History of Epidemics in Britain (Cambridge University Press, 1891, Charles Creighton questioned the wisdom of the actions taken at the revival of the epidemic in 1666 as mistaken, though well-meaning. Instead, \"the villagers of Eyam were sacrificed\u2026to an idea, and to an idea which we may now say was not scientifically sound.\" Charles Creighton,  A History of Epidemics in Britain (CUP 1891), p.687"]}, {"page": "Vaccine hesitancy", "response": ["There was legitimate concern from supporters of vaccination about its safety and efficacy, but this was overshadowed by general condemnation, particularly when legislation started to introduce compulsory vaccination. The reason for this was that vaccination was introduced before laboratory methods were developed to control its production and account for its failures. Vaccine was maintained initially through arm-to-arm transfer and later through production on the skin of animals, and bacteriological sterility was impossible. Further, identification methods for potential pathogens were not available until the late 19th to early 20th century. Diseases later shown to be caused by contaminated vaccine included erysipelas, tuberculosis, tetanus, and syphilis. This last, though rareestimated at 750 cases in 100 million vaccinationsattracted particular attention. Much later, Charles Creighton, a leading medical opponent of vaccination, claimed that the vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis and devoted a book to the subject. As cases of smallpox started to occur in those who had been vaccinated earlier, supporters of vaccination pointed out that these were usually very mild and occurred years after the vaccination. In turn, opponents of vaccination pointed out that this contradicted Jenner's belief that vaccination conferred complete protection. The views of opponents of vaccination that it was both dangerous and ineffective led to the development of determined anti-vaccination movements in England when legislation was introduced to make vaccination compulsory.", "Because of its greater risks, variolation was banned in England by the 1840 Vaccination Act, which also introduced free voluntary vaccination for infants. Thereafter Parliament passed successive acts to enact and enforce compulsory vaccination. The 1853 act introduced compulsory vaccination, with fines for non-compliance and imprisonment for non-payment. The 1867 act extended the age requirement to 14 years and introduced repeated fines for repeated refusal for the same child. Initially, vaccination regulations were organised by the local Poor Law Guardians, and in towns where there was strong opposition to vaccination, sympathetic Guardians were elected who did not pursue prosecutions. This was changed by the 1871 act, which required Guardians to act. This significantly changed the relationship between the government and the public, and organized protests increased. In Keighley, Yorkshire, in 1876 the Guardians were arrested and briefly imprisoned in York Castle, prompting large demonstrations in support of the \"Keighley Seven\". The protest movements crossed social boundaries. The financial burden of fines fell hardest on the working class, who would provide the largest numbers at public demonstrations. Societies and publications were organized by the middle classes, and support came from celebrities such as George Bernard Shaw and Alfred Russel Wallace, doctors such as Charles Creighton and Edgar Crookshank, and parliamentarians such as Jacob Bright and James Allanson Picton. By 1885, with over 3,000 prosecutions pending in Leicester, a mass rally there was attended by over 20,000 protesters."]}, {"page": "Peterhead", "response": ["*Charles Creighton, physician and medical author"]}, {"page": "William Collins (surgeon)", "response": ["Along with Charles Creighton and Edgar Crookshank, he became one of a small number of medical critics of smallpox vaccination in the late 19th century.

The traditional view held that food was relatively abundant in the UK, or at least in \"Merry England\"  with its \"miraculous fertility\".Quotation is a translation from Piers Ploughman; there are many similar boasts in early English literature, for example see Creighton (1891) Even as early as the 19th century this view was challenged, with medical historians such as Charles Creighton arguing that the effect of hunger in checking population growth was roughly equivalent on both Britain and continental Europe."]}, {"page": "Brown Animal Sanatory Institution", "response": ["Among the other researchers who worked there were Charles Creighton, L.C.

Fernel and Par\u00e9 suggested that the 1510 influenza \"spread to almost all countries of the world\" (not concerning Spain's territories in the New World). An epidemiological study of past influenza pandemics reviewing previous medical historians' data has found England was affected in 1510 and there were reports of symptoms like \"gastrodynia\" and noteworthy murrain among cattle. The 1510 flu is also recorded to have reached Ireland."]}, {"page": "1557 influenza pandemic", "response": ["In 1557 a pandemic strain of influenza emerged in Asia, then spread to Africa, Europe, and eventually the Americas. This flu was highly infectious and presented with intense, occasionally lethal symptoms. Medical historians like Thomas Short, Lazare Rivi\u00e8re and Charles Creighton gathered descriptions of catarrhal fevers recognized as influenza by modern physicians attacking populations with the greatest intensity between 1557 and 1559. The 1557 flu saw governments, for possibly the first time, inviting physicians to instill bureaucratic organization into epidemic responses. It is also the first pandemic where influenza is pathologically linked to miscarriages, given its first English names, and is reliably recorded as having spread globally. Influenza caused higher burial rates, near-universal infection, and economic turmoil as it returned in repeated waves.", "The 1557 influenza severely impacted the British Isles. British medical historian Charles Creighton cited a contemporary writer, Wriothesley, who noted in 1557 \"this summer reigned in England divers strange and new sicknesses, taking men and women in their heads; as strange agues and fevers, whereof many died.\" 18th Century physician Thomas Short wrote that those who succumbed to the flu \"were let blood of or had unsound viscera.\" Flu blighted the army of Mary I of England by leaving her government unable to train sufficient reinforcements for the Earl of Rutland to protect Calais from an impending French assault, and by January 1558 the Duke of Guise had claimed the under-protected city in the name of France.", "The 1557 pandemic's nature as a worldwide, highly-contagious respiratory disease with fast onset of flu-like symptoms has led many physicians, from medical historians like Charles Creighton to modern epidemiologists, to consider the causative disease as influenza. \"Well documented descriptions from medical observers\" who witnessed the effects of the pandemic as it spread through populations have been reviewed by numerous medical historians in the centuries since. Contemporary physicians to the 1557 flu, like Ingrassia, Valleriola, Dodoens, and Mercado, described symptoms like severe coughing, fever, myalgia, and pneumonia that all occurred within a short period of time and led to death in days if a case was to be fatal. Infections became so widespread in countries that influences like the weather, stars, and mass poisoning were blamed by observers for the outbreaks, a reoccurring pattern in influenza epidemics that has contributed to the disease's name. Prior to greater research being conducted into influenza in the 19th century, some medical historians considered the descriptions of epidemic \"angina\" from 1557 to be scarlet fever, whooping cough, and diphtheria. But the most striking features of scarlet fever and diphtheria, like rashes or pseudomembranes, remain unmentioned by any of the 1557 pandemic's observers and the first recognized whooping cough epidemic is a localized outbreak in Paris from 1578. These illnesses can resemble the flu in their early stages but pandemic influenza is distinguished by its fast-moving, unrestricted epidemics of severe respiratory disease affecting all ages with widespread infections and mortalities."]}, {"page": "Charles Creighton", "response": ["Charles Creighton may refer to:", "* Charles Creighton (physician) (1847\u20131927), British physician and medical author", "* Charles Creighton (referee) (1876\u20131949), Irish-American soccer referee"]}, {"page": "Creighton (name)", "response": ["* Charles Creighton (disambiguation)", "** Charles Creighton (physician) (1847\u20131927), British physician, opponent of vaccination", "** Charles Creighton (referee) (1876\u20131949), Irish-American soccer referee"]}]}}
