He continued to be available as reserve wicketkeeper but only played in one further championship match for Hampshire (aged 43) in the drawn match against Surrey in May 1966, where his last victim was skipper Mickey Stewart, who he caught for 13 off the bowling of Butch White. That appearance made him the last player to have appeared in a County Championship match who had previously played in a pre-war championship game."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Ralph Prouton, cricketer, was born in Southampton"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 in English football", "response": ["* 12 September 2018: Ralph Prouton, 92, Swindon Town left half."]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Ralph Prouton, 92, English cricketer and footballer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2018", "response": ["*Ralph Prouton, 92, English cricketer and footballer.Ralph Prouton RIP"]}, {"page": "Prouton", "response": ["* Ralph Prouton, cricketer"]}]}}
