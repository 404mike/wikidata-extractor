Many rate the Violin Concerto equally highly, but some do not. Sackville-West omitted it from the list of Elgar masterpieces in The Record Guide,Sackville West, p. 254 and in a long analytical article in The Musical Quarterly, Daniel Gregory Mason criticised the first movement of the concerto for a \"kind of sing-songiness\u00a0... as fatal to noble rhythm in music as it is in poetry.\"Mason, Daniel Gregory, \"A Study of Elgar\", The Musical Quarterly, April 1917, pp. 288\u2013303 Falstaff also divides opinion.
