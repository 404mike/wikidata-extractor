Trained by the architect Philip Hardwick (1792\u20131870), he popularized William Morris's notions of decorative arts in the Arts and Crafts style, becoming one of the principal exponents of the revived Early English or Modern Gothic style popular during the nineteenth century. He did not make any furniture; his designs were produced by professional cabinet makers.\nIn 1868 he published Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details, which was very influential in Britain, and later in the United States, where the book was published in 1872. From 1866 to 1877 he was secretary to the Royal Institute of British Architects, and from 1878 to 1898 he was Keeper of the National Gallery, London.He died, aged 70, at Leinster Square, Bayswater, and was buried at Kensal Green.\nThe style of furniture named after him, Eastlake style, flourished during the later half of the nineteenth century. A style of architecture, with old English and Gothic elements, is also named for him.\nHis uncle, Sir Charles Lock Eastlake PRA (born in 1793), was an earlier Keeper of the National Gallery, from 1843 to 1847, which, nowadays, results in much confusion between the two men, whose names are distinguished only by the presence or absence of an \"e\" in their middle names.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Severn", "response": ["Severn was also instrumental in helping to found the British Academy of the Fine Arts in Rome, which drew the support of such influential figures as the Duke of Devonshire, John Flaxman and Sir Thomas Lawrence.

The social historian G.\u00a0M. Trevelyan expressed the then commonly held, and highly dismissive, view; \"the monstrosities of architecture erected by order of the dons of Oxford and Cambridge colleges in the days of William Butterfield and Alfred Waterhouse give daily pain to posterity.\" Sir Kenneth Clark recalled that during his Oxford years it was generally believed in Oxford not only that Keble College was \"the ugliest building in the world\" but that its architect was John Ruskin, author of The Stones of Venice.

The movement is generally considered part of the late Victorian period in terms of broad antique furniture designations. In architecture the Eastlake style or Eastlake architecture is part of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture.", "Although Charles Eastlake did not make furniture, his movement influenced the interior design of American homes with English designs that were easy to clean, functional, and simple. The \u2018Eastlake\u2019 style is of Victorian architecture and one of the core principles of this style was that Eastlake thought that the furniture in people's homes should be good looking and be made by manufacturers who enjoyed their work. This was contrary to the previous style of furniture, with pieces that were large, heavy, and thick, and that collected dust and germs.", "Eastlake style applied to houses as well as furniture. Characteristics of these houses include the lathe-shaped wooden forms and mechanical jigsaw wooden forms. Porch posts and railings had intricate wooden designs and curved brackets and scrolls were placed at corners. The fa\u00e7ade also included \"perforated gables and pediments, carved panels and a profusion of beaded spindles, and lattice work found along porch eaves.\" Mansardic porches were another characteristic and had wrought iron crestings. The color combination of the houses also emphasized the contrast between the lighter colors of the details and the darker colors of the house body. In the United States, especially in California, American home builders in the 1880s replaced flat-cut gingerbread ornamental elements that were popular in the 1860s and 1870s with lathe-tuned spindlework for balusters and wall surface decoration. Charles Eastlake criticized the American adaptation as \"extravagant and bizarre\". However, the style lived on and it was later combined with Italianate and Second Empire elements to create the \"San Francisco Style\"."]}, {"page": "List of furniture designers", "response": ["* Charles Eastlake (1836-1906)"]}, {"page": "1906 in art", "response": ["* November 20 \u2013 Charles Eastlake, English architect and furniture designer (born 1836)"]}, {"page": "Alfred Waterhouse", "response": ["Writing in 1872 in his book History of the Gothic Revival, Charles Eastlake had this to say about the building:", "Colleges at both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge would commission buildings from Waterhouse, indeed from 1865 to his retirement he was almost at continual work at one or both Universities.Cunningham & Waterhouse, p. 63 In (1865\u201367) the Cambridge Union Society commissioned a new debating hall, smoking room and caretaker's house, he returned twenty years later to double the size of the building with a new wing.Cunningham & Waterhouse, p. 66 At Balliol College, Oxford, his first work was the new Master's Lodge facing Broad Street and the main range L-shaped with a tower above the entrance to the college with a lecture hall (1866\u201371), in style French thirteenth-century Gothic.

They gained popularity in the late 1800s as Americans sought sophisticated interior design. Durable, lightweight and fireproof, tin ceilings were appealing to home and business owners alike as a functionally attractive design element that was readily available. Important critics such as John Ruskin, George Gilbert Scott, Charles Eastlake and William Morris debated the implications of faux materials. These critics believed it was morally wrong and deceptive to imitate another material and blamed the degradation of society towards the \"art of shamming\" rather than honesty in architecture. Nevertheless, tin ceilings lasted longer than plaster ones and were easier to clean. They encapsulated ideas of democracy, making such decoration available to the middle class majority who supported the machine production."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Ferrey", "response": ["Charles Eastlake in his History of the Gothic Revival  described Ferrey as \"one of the earliest, ablest, and most zealous pioneers of the modern Gothic school\" and said his work \"possessed the rare charm of simplicity, without lacking interest\".Eastlake, 1872, page 220"]}, {"page": "Adirondack Architecture", "response": ["The style drew upon Swiss chalet architecture, which had been introduced to America by Andrew Jackson Downing around 1850.

Downing's design principles emphasized utility, structural expression, and conformity to natural surroundings.  The building form was influenced by Stick style, but using log framing instead of dimensional lumber to express the structural system of the buildings.  Charles Eastlake's book Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details also influenced the Adirondack rustic style.
