He presented the 2009 series Henry: Mind of a Tyrant, which Brian Viner, a reviewer for the Independent, called \"highly fascinating\", although A. A. Gill was less complimentary, calling it \"Hello! history\". In an interview about the series for the Radio Times, Starkey complained that too many historians had focused not on Henry, but on his wives. Referring to a \"feminised history\", he said: \"so many of the writers who write about this are women and so much of their audience is a female audience.\" This prompted the historian Lucy Worsley to describe his comments as misogynistic. More recently, in 2011, he taught five history lessons in Channel 4's Jamie's Dream School, after which he criticised the state education system."]}, {"page": "Lucy", "response": ["* Lucy Worsley (born 1973), English historian"]}, {"page": "Historic Royal Palaces", "response": ["The organisation is jointly curated by Lucy Worsley and Tracy Borman."]}, {"page": "St Bartholomew's School", "response": ["* Lucy Worsley \u2013 historian, curator, and television presenter "]}, {"page": "The Abbey School, Reading", "response": ["and the historian Lucy Worsley.", "*Lucy Worsley, historian, author, curator and television presenter"]}, {"page": "Kentwell Hall", "response": ["|  A Very British Murder with Lucy Worsley", "|  Documentary on the murder of Maria Marten in the Red Barn, Polstead, Suffolk, UK.

This led to complaints to the BBC about why it didn't bleep that word out or said \"the N-word\". It also led to questions about why a white person was even allowed to say that word. The N-word was used in the attack. A few days later, the BBC also received criticism after airing the offensive language used by historian Lucy Worsley when quoting former American president Abraham Lincoln, on her documentary American History's Biggest Fibs which aired on BBC Two on 1 August 2020. The documentary first aired on BBC Four in 2019. The BBC has defended the use of the N-word in response on 4 August 2020 saying it wanted to report the word allegedly used in the attack of K-Dogg, and this decision was supported by the family of the victim, but the corporation accepted that it did cause offence. On 8 August, Sideman, real name David Whitely, has decided to leave BBC Radio 1Xtra because of the use of the racial slur and the defense of it. The next day, 9 August, the BBC apologised over the use of the N-word and said a mistake was made.
