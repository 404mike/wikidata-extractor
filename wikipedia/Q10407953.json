Others took part in significant matches in club history. Billy Ollis, Jenkyns, Ted Devey, Jack Hallam, Wheldon and Tommy Hands appeared in Small Heath's first Football League match in 1892. Eight men listed here played in Birmingham's pioneering venture into club football in Europe in the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and ten played on the losing side in the 1956 FA Cup Final (an eleventh, Roy Warhurst, missed the match through injury). In more recent times, Paul Tait scored the first golden goal to decide a Wembley cup final, against Carlisle United in the 1995 Football League Trophy. Geoff Horsfield scored the extra-time equaliser that took the 2002 First Division play-off final into a shootout; Paul Devlin and Stan Lazaridis converted their spot-kicks as Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time. Seven men listed here, including captain Stephen Carr and goalscorer Nikola \u017digi\u0107, took the field as Birmingham won the 2011 League Cup; another two were unused substitutes.
