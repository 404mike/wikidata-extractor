During his time there, he was a member of the squad that was the first to take the English Schools' FA Cup out of England. He later joined his hometown club, Cardiff City, signing on a YTS scheme. He made his professional debut on 8 September 1984 in a 4\u20132 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion. Rees did not make another league appearance for the club until the following year when he was on the receiving end of eight defeats in nine appearances during the 1985\u201386 season. A wrist injury kept him sidelined for nearly a year and, on his return, the presence of Graham Moseley meant he was sold to First Division club Watford for a fee of \u00a360,000."]}]}}
