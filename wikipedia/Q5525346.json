A slow-left arm spin bowler, he played one match for Yorkshire in 1994, having graduated from their cricket academy, before moving to Lancashire in 1995. He played for the club until 2012 taking over 500 first-class wickets. Although he had played youth internationals, he never played for the senior England team, although he was named in the squad a few times. In 2011 he was part of the Lancashire squad that won the County Championship for the first time since 1950. Keedy subsequently played one season for Surrey and two for Nottinghamshire before retiring as a professional cricketer in 2015. After studying physiotherapy at the University of Salford, he is currently Nottinghamshire's spin bowling coach and assistant physiotherapist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["2003 was a promising year, and Lancashire were genuine contenders for the county championship.
