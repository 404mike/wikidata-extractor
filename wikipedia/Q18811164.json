In the 1920\u201321 season, Hall played for Pinxton in the Derbyshire Senior League. Towards the end of the season, he joined Midland League club Lincoln City on trial. Having produced a good performance for the club's reserves, he made his senior debut on 30 April 1921 against Rotherham County. His corner led to Lincoln's opening goal in a 2\u20131 win that confirmed the club as champions, he was signed up for the season to come, and played in the remaining two matches of the Midland League season.Lincoln were elected to the Third Division North, newly formed for 1921\u201322, and Hall made 16 appearances that season. He then signed for Third Division runners-up Darlington. He played in the first half of the campaign, but by December had lost his place to Thompson Kirkham, and finished the season with one goal from 13 league appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Hall", "response": ["Harry Hall may refer to:", "* Harry Hall (painter) (c. 1814\u20131882),  English equestrian painter", "* Harry Hall (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u2013?), English footballer who played for Sheffield United", "* Harry Hall (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u2013?), English footballer who played for Southampton", "* Harry Hall (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u2013?), English footballer who played for Lincoln City and Darlington", "* Harry Hall (Australian footballer) (1882\u20131967), Australian rules footballer", "* Harry Hall (cricketer) (born 1970), English cricketer who played for Berkshire", "* Harry Hall (botanist) (1906\u20131986), British born South African botanist"]}, {"page": "Thompson Kirkham", "response": ["Kirkham was the third child of Thomas Gallon Kirkham, a lighterman, and his wife Elizabeth Jane.
