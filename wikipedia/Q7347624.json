The late arrival of Arethusa\u2014under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself\u2014sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Ni\u00e9men to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea for long periods of time was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy.", "Although Ni\u00e9men was very badly damaged, Amethyst was almost uncontrollable and despite Seymour's best efforts, he was unable to close with Ni\u00e9men to ensure her surrender.

At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa.Clowes, p. 435 Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio.James, p. 156 Mends immediately pulled alongside Ni\u00e9men and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit.
