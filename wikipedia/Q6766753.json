The return leg took place three days later at Filbert Street in Leicester.  In the last moments of the first half, Leicester took the lead: Mark Blake's shot hit the post and Ian Ormondroyd converted the rebound.  A minute into the second half, Pat Nevin levelled the score by converting a Ged Brannan cross.  David Speedie, a second-half substitute, then restored Leicester's lead with four minutes remaining, heading in a free kick from Blake.  With only seconds of the match remaining, an altercation between Speedie and the Tranmere goalkeeper Eric Nixon resulted in both players being sent off.
