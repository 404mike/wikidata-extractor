Secularists in Italy did not appreciate intervention by the Pope in worldly affairs. Catholic capitalists have been disturbed by some of the left-leaning themes and the call for a stronger world political authority. Writing for The Irish Times, Tina Beattie praised the encyclical for its insightful comments on the economic crises. But she went on to suggest the Catholic idealization of sexuality hinted at in the encyclical may be part of the cause of child abuse scandals that have recently rocked Ireland.

It received mixed reviews from the theologian Tina Beattie in The Tablet and the psychologist Christopher Ferguson in a Psychology Today blogpost.

She criticized Shrier's use of anecdotes from parents or professionals, apparently unbeknownst to the subjects themselves. She wrote that, while \"many of Shrier's claims may be open to challenge\", the reported increase in cases of adolescent-onset dysphoria \"should be a cause for much greater caution and disquiet than is currently the case\". Christopher Ferguson wrote that Shrier had \"some valid ideas\" and that he was \"not willing to dismiss her thesis entirely\", but also that she failed to \"carefully hew\" to science and that \"high-quality, preregistered, open science, scientific efforts\" were needed in the area."]}]}}
