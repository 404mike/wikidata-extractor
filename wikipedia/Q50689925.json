Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) asks Belle to look after his daughter April Windsor (Amelia Flanagan), which Taylor-Draper notes is a \"massive step for Belle\" since it means that people are trusting her with responsibilities. However, after he sees Belle arguing with Gabby, he decides \"he no longer wants her near his child\", which is \"really hard for Belle to deal with\". The actress notes that although Gabby initiates the rivalry between them, Belle \"becomes awful to Gabby\". Someone is believed to be targeting Belle, putting abusive graffiti on her front door, smashing the windows at her home, and attacking her. After Belle believes she can communicate with Gemma and begins to follow her \"instructions\", producers confirmed that these events would form \"an ongoing mental health storyline for Belle\", who is suffering trauma after Gemma's death and her experiences in prison. Emmerdale producers consulted with the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Foundation NHS Trust for the storyline, who stated that they were happy to lend support to the soap as it has \"have a great platform for raising awareness of serious mental illnesses like psychosis\". She has an outburst, where she reveals that she is responsible for all of the targeted attacks, rather than Lachlan, who people believe to be the culprit. Taylor-Draper explained: \"Gemma is tormenting her, bullying her but from within her own mind. It's not like she sees Gemma as a ghost, but Gemma is surrounding her. Belle is doing things because she is being told to. Everyone thinks she is being bullied and then attacked by Lachlan but it's not, it's her. It's coming from Gemma\". The actress felt \"honoured\" to be given an issue-led storyline, and stated that she knew it would be \"challenging\" prior to beginning the story. She spoke to someone who had a \"quite similar\" story to Belle, in order to portray the mental illness correctly. The storyline progresses when Belle hears Gemma telling her that Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox) has a problem with Belle, and encourages her to hurt her. Taylor-Draped stated that \"Belle knows deep down\" that Edna and Belle are fine, but she \"feels obliged to attack Edna in some way - just to make Gemma calm down\". The storyline reaches a \"climax\" in January 2015 when Belle bites Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) and locks herself in a car, leading medical professionals to get involved. Katie later dies by falling through the floor in a farm, and despite having no involvement in her death, Belle blames herself. She attempts suicide, and is hospitalised."]}, {"page": "Inside Soap Awards", "response": ["| Amelia Flanagan", "|Amelia Flanagan", "| Amelia Flanagan (April Windsor in Emmerdale)", "| Matilda Freeman (Summer Spellman in Coronation Street)Amelia Flanagan (April Windsor in Emmerdale)Ela-May Demircan (Leah Barnes in Hollyoaks)", "| Amelia Flanagan (April Windsor in Emmerdale)Joe-Warren Plant (Jacob Gallagher in Emmerdale)Aedan Duckworth (Ollie Morgan in Hollyoaks) "]}, {"page": "List of British current child actors", "response": ["* Amelia Flanagan (born 2008)"]}, {"page": "List of Emmerdale characters (2007)", "response": ["Over summer 2021, Cathy gets jealous of all the attention her niece April Windsor (Amelia Flanagan) is receiving on her memorial page for Donna.
