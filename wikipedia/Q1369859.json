He moved to Rangers as a free agent in 2007 and enjoyed success with the Ibrox club until he left Rangers by mutual consent in August 2012. Broadfoot then joined English club Blackpool, but was released by them in May 2014, moving on to Rotherham. In 2017 he returned to Scotland and joined Kilmarnock, spending two full seasons with the club. Broadfoot returned to St Mirren in September 2019, however in January 2020, he moved back to Kilmarnock.\nHe made his debut for the Scotland national team on 10 September 2008 against Iceland, a game in which he scored.

Celtic won their first eight league matches under Lennon, although controversy erupted in their 2\u20131 win away at Dundee United on 17 October 2010. Celtic were awarded a penalty kick in the second half, but the decision was then rescinded by referee Dougie McDonald. McDonald explained after the match that he over-ruled the penalty award on the advice of the assistant referee. Lennon reluctantly accepted McDonald's explanation, commenting \"I suppose you have to put it down to another honest mistake by the referee.\" It was, however, later revealed that McDonald had lied in his explanation over the penalty award and the referee subsequently resigned several weeks later having received a warning from the Scottish Football Association after failing to properly explain his overturning of the penalty award. Further referring controversy ensued the following week when Celtic lost their unbeaten run in the league, losing 3\u20131 at home against Rangers. The Ibrox club's third goal came as a result of penalty awarded when Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot fell to the ground under a challenge from Celtic's Daniel Majstorovi\u0107. Broadfoot appeared to have dived, and television footage showed that the referee had his back to the play when the challenge occurred, only turning in time to see Broadfoot fall to the ground. Lennon stated afterwards that he felt the referee \"got a couple of decisions wrong\", and added regarding the penalty, \"I'm not sure that he saw it so I don't know why he's given it. He's got a lot of questions to answer\". In November, Lennon led Celtic to a 9\u20130 win over Aberdeen, a record win in the Scottish Premier League and Aberdeen's heaviest ever defeat. Celtic lost their next game 2\u20130 away against Hearts, with Celtic's Joe Ledley sent off for the first time in his career for a \"strong\" challenge on Ian Black. Celtic were later denied a penalty award in the second half, and shortly afterwards Lennon was sent to the stand by the referee. Lennon defended Ledley after the match, describing referee Craig Thomson's decision as \"ridiculous\". Lennon was later given a six match touchline ban for excessive misconduct as a result of the incident in the Hearts' game, although it was later reduced to four matches after appeal. He was given another four match touchline ban by the SFA following an altercation with Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist after a Scottish Cup match in March 2011."]}, {"page": "Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink", "response": ["The 2008\u201309 season started slowly for Vennegoor of Hesselink. On 31 August, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute, he was sent off against Rangers at Celtic Park for kicking out at Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot. Rangers won the match 4\u20132. He scored his first goals of the season against Aberdeen in a 3\u20132 win at Celtic Park on 27 September, with his second being a last-minute winner. Vennegoor of Hesselink then went on a long goal drought (mainly due to the fact that he was out injured for over three months) until 4 April 2009, when he scored the final goal of Celtic's 4\u20130 win against Hamilton Academical with a simple tap-in. He scored again four days later in another 4\u20130 victory with another simple tap-in, this time the second against Falkirk. The big striker made it three goals in three games on 11 April when he scored the opening goal against Hearts at Tynecastle with less than 25 seconds on the clock. The game ended 1\u20131 with Bruno Aguiar scoring the equaliser for Hearts. It was then four in four when he scored a 43rd-minute opener in a 2\u20130 win at home to Aberdeen on 18 April. He ended the season with a League Cup winners' medal, after Celtic beat Rangers 2\u20130 in the final on 15 March.

Rangers equalised in the 17th minute with a David Weir header from a corner kick and Celtic's set-piece weakness was exploited again less than 15 minutes later when Daniel Cousin scored from another corner kick.

Manager Kenny Shiels wanted an end to the row that developed between Kirk Broadfoot and Pascali and referred to Broadfoot as \"the ugly boy from Rangers\" and \"the male model from Ayrshire\" in a radio interview. However, Broadfoot claimed Pascali made death threats and was \"in my face saying he was going to kill me\".
