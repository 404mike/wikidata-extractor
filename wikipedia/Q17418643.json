A new youth team, named Brentford Town Juniors, was launched in 1948 and won the Hounslow Minor Shield in its inaugural season. Products of the team included Alan Bassham, George Bristow, Roy Hart and George Lowden. The youth team reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup in 1952\u201353, succumbing 8\u20131 on aggregate to the eventual winners Manchester United. Under the stewardship of Alf Bew and because of the financial constraints imposed on the first team, the youth team of the early 1950s was particularly productive, yielding Vernon Avis, Johnny Pearson, Gerry Cakebread, Dennis Heath, Jim Towers and George Francis. Following financial problems in 1967, the youth team was disbanded, but was revived again in 1972 with money raised by supporters. The youth team won a youth tournament in Frankfurt the following year, beating Frem in the final, with Richard Poole top-scoring. Along with Poole, Kevin Harding and Roy Cotton progressed to play league football with the first team, while Gary Huxley won England Youth international honours. The youth team ceased playing competitive fixtures at the end of the 1973\u201374 season.", "*  Vernon Avis"]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["| Vernon Avis"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Vernon Avis", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Vernon Avis"]}, {"page": "1956\u201357 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Vernon Avis", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Vernon Avis"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Vernon Avis", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Vernon Avis"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Vernon Avis", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Vernon Avis", "| Vernon Avis"]}]}}
