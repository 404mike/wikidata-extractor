According to Hill biographer Chris Nickson in 1999, \"there was the possibility of more dates being added\u00a0... but it was unlikely that Lauryn would be willing to make the tour more grueling and draining. She'd come to know that there was much more to life than a career.\""]}, {"page": "Here Is Mariah Carey", "response": ["Here Is Mariah Carey received positive reviews from critics. Steve Holsey of the Michigan Chronicle considered her vocals impressive, the Lansing State Journals Mike Hughes felt her voice had \"moments of luminous beauty\", and Steve Morse of The Boston Globe thought she \"sings like a songbird\". Toronto Star television critic Greg Quill wrote that the performance \"affirms her extraordinary vocal abilities\". Elaine Lim in the New Straits Times and Roger Catlin in the Hartford Courant agreed that Carey proved she could sing just as well live as in a studio. Morse and Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press viewed Carey's rendition of \"Without You\" as the musical highlight. The latter derided Carey's original songs as dull and derivative, as did Voxs Fred Dellar. Holsey felt Carey lacked the charisma of Whitney Houston or Tina Turner on stage, and author Chris Nickson said she failed to match the versatility Barbra Streisand had in her 1960s television specials."]}, {"page": "Dimanche \u00e0 Bamako", "response": ["In a review for Allmusic, Chris Nickson gave the album a star rating of 4 out of 5. Joe Tangari of Pitchfork Media gave the album a rating of 8 out of 10 and said that \"it would be a crime if it didn't rocket Amadou & Mariam straight to stardom.\" Spin named the album the 33rd best album released in 2005.

He doesn\u2019t hammer you over the head with his technique, but instead seduces with melody and invention, as on the opener, \u201cThe Tempest in Mall,\u201d where subtle West African influences float under the music to create a lulling, gentle atmosphere. There\u2019s very strong support from the other musicians, especially fiddler Liz Coleman and the pair of guitar duets with Ciaran Swift are little short of gorgeous. He closes with an interesting, slow version of Drowsy Maggie that brings out the delights of the tune to round out an album that is, yes, magic.\"HighBeam"]}, {"page": "Orchestral pop", "response": ["According to Chris Nickson, the \"vital orchestral pop of 1966\" was \"challenging, rather than vapid, easy listening\". Spin magazine refers to Burt Bacharach and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson as \"gods\" of orchestral pop. In Nickson's opinion, the \"apex\" of orchestral pop lay in singer Scott Walker, explaining that \"in his most fertile period, 1967\u201370, he created a body of work that was, in its own way, as revolutionary as the Beatles'. He took the ideas of [Henry] Mancini and Bacharach to their logical conclusion, essentially redefining the concept of orchestral pop.\""]}, {"page": "Severn House Publishers", "response": ["*Chris Nickson"]}, {"page": "Progressive rap", "response": ["While highly successful with critics, the progressive rap music of this period failed to capture a sizable audience within hip hop's traditionalist base of artists and fans, who gravitated more toward hardcore stylings in the genre. De La Soul's 1989 debut album 3 Feet High and Rising, with its mix of collected sounds ranging from soul to psychedelic music, received widespread acclaim and sold well outside of the rap market. But the group's success was soon overshadowed by the sudden rise of gangsta rap in the early 1990s. \"De La Soul went from the front of the hip-hop pack to the back of an appealing and colorful dead-end street\", as Chris Nickson recounts."]}]}}
