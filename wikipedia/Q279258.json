He served as manager of Barcelona for seven consecutive seasons, a record that has only been beaten by Johan Cruyff and later had a second spell as Barcelona manager. In Rory Smith's book \"Mister: The Men Who Gave the World the Game\" it is contested that Greenwell was manager for ten years, which would make him Barcelona's longest serving coach. In 1939 Greenwell became the only non-South American coach to date to win the South American Championship when he guided Peru to their first win. He also served as a manager with CD Castell\u00f3n, RCD Espa\u00f1ol, Valencia CF, Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, RCD Mallorca, Universitario de Deportes and Independiente Santa Fe.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
