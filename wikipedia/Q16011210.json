The stairwell was decorated with a photomontage agitprop mural created by the British artist Mario Dubsky (1939\u201385) and the American painter John Button (1929\u201382) both of whom were early victims of AIDS. The Mural was destroyed in the fire that destroyed the centre in 1974.

These last paintings are the most widely respected of his works. A retrospective exhibition of his work was held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1963 and in 1966 he became chairman of the faculty of painting at the British School in Rome. In 1982 he was appointed CBE and in 1985 he was elected to the Royal Academy.  A centenary tribute at James Hyman Fine Art in 2005 was accompanied by a catalogue with essays about Medley's work. Medley was also an important supporter of emerging out gay artists studying at the Slade who included Mario Dubsky and Derek Jarman."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"D\"", "response": ["*Mario Dubsky (1939\u20131985), English artist"]}, {"page": "Dorothy Mead", "response": ["From 1956 until 1959, Mead was a mature student at the Slade School of Art. Here she met the artist and teacher Andrew Forge. She had a major influence on students such as Patrick Procktor and Mario Dubsky and was the first woman president of the student annual exhibiting society, Young Contemporaries (later renamed New Contemporaries), in 1959. The previous year, the Slade awarded her the Figure Painting Prize, and the Steer Prize. In 1959 she was asked to leave the Slade, in spite of her award-winning work, because she refused to sit the course on perspective. She believed - with Bomberg - that the stylistic approach was invalid. Her thesis, explaining her view was not accepted by the principal, William Coldstream."]}, {"page": "Mary Cozens-Walker", "response": ["Mary Cozens-Walker was born on 11 August 1938 in Harrow, Middlesex.
