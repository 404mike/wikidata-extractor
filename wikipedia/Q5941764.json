His next match was not until two years later, when he appeared against the New Zealanders on their first tour of England, where his 31 from number ten in the order could not prevent a heavy Worcestershire defeat.\nGarratt's three other first-class appearances all came in the 1928 County Championship. In the first, a drawn game against Yorkshire, he made a career-best 39, but he did little in the other two matches, against Sussex (which Worcestershire lost by 243 runs) and Leicestershire (which Worcestershire lost by an innings and 206 runs).\nGarratt was born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey; he died at the age of 76 in Worplesdon Hill, Woking in the same county.", "link_mentions": {}}}
