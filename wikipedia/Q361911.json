The line-up for the first three albums was Brooker (piano and lead vocals), Trower (guitar and lead vocals), Fisher (organ and lead vocals), Knights (bass), Wilson (drums), and Reid (lyricist). Former Paramount Chris Copping joined on organ and bass in 1970. The group appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. By 1971, the disparities in style had become too great and, after the release of the fifth album Broken Barricades, Trower left to form his own power trio band and was replaced by Dave Ball. From late 1972 until 1977, the group's guitarist was Mick Grabham."]}, {"page": "Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["* Dave Ball \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Grand Hotel (album)", "response": ["Grand Hotel is the sixth studio album by Procol Harum. Released in 1973, it signalled a change of direction for the band. Guitarist Dave Ball, who had joined the band for their live album the previous year, left shortly after the photo shoot for the proposed album's cover, to be replaced by Mick Grabham. Grabham's head was superimposed on the front and back cover of the album on Ball's body. Although the band had gone through significant personnel changes in previous years, the band would enter its most stable phase with this lineup.", "In 2009 Salvo reissued the CD remastered by Nick Robbins. Vocalist/keyboardist/composer Gary Brooker and lyricist Keith Reid supplemented the original CD with two bonus tracks. Both were \"raw\" tracks; i.e., they did not feature overdubs. One of the bonus tracks, \"Bringing Home the Bacon\", is the only one to feature former guitarist Dave Ball. The 2009 reissue also featured an essay by Patrick Humphries and was reissued in a cardboard sleeve."]}, {"page": "Matthew Fisher (musician)", "response": ["Although no longer involved directly in recording and touring, Fisher continued as a producer for the group. After Trower left in 1971 for a solo career, he briefly rejoined the band, with bandmate Chris Copping moving full-time onto bass. He was unhappy with the financial situation of the band, and with Trower's replacement, Dave Ball, and so left again, this time acrimoniously, to become a full-time producer for CBS."]}, {"page": "David Ball", "response": ["David or Dave Ball may refer to:", "* Dave Ball (guitarist) (1950\u20132015), guitarist formerly of Procol Harum, Bedlam, Long John Baldry, etc.", "* Dave Ball (defensive end) (born 1981), American football player", "* Dave Ball, Survivor: Samoa competitor"]}, {"page": "Conquistador (Procol Harum song)", "response": ["* Dave Ballguitar"]}, {"page": "Dave Ball (Musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Ball (guitarist) "]}, {"page": "Ball (surname)", "response": ["*Dave Ball (guitarist) (1950\u20132015), guitarist formerly of Procol Harum, Bedlam, Long John Baldry, etc.", "* Dave Ball, Survivor: Samoa competitor", "*Dave Ball (defensive end) (born 1981), American football player"]}, {"page": "Dave Ball (musician 1950)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Ball (guitarist)"]}]}}
