He is currently head of football at National League side Southend United.\nAfter his playing career was cut short by injury, Still began managing non-League clubs around his hometown area of East London, Essex and Kent, achieving title wins and promotions with Leytonstone & Ilford, Dartford, Maidstone United and Redbridge Forest. He was manager of Redbridge Forest when the club merged with Dagenham in 1992 to become its current incarnation \u2013 Dagenham & Redbridge. Still accepted his first job in the Football League in August 1994 at Peterborough United, but was sacked a year later. He joined Barnet in June 1997 and took the club to the play-offs twice, before leaving in 2002 after the club was relegated to the Football Conference. Still returned to Dagenham & Redbridge in April 2004, guiding the club to promotion to League Two in 2006\u201307 and then to League One three years later. In February 2013, after nine seasons in charge, Still left Dagenham and dropped down a league to join Luton Town. In his first full season as Luton manager, the club were crowned as Conference Premier champions and won promotion to League Two, making Still the only manager to lead three clubs to promotion out of non-League football. He led Luton to an eighth-placed finish in League Two in 2014\u201315, before leaving the club in December 2015. Still rejoined Dagenham for a third term as manager on 31 December 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luton Town F.C.", "response": ["Relegation meant that 2009\u201310 saw Luton playing in the Conference Premier, a competition in which the club had never before participated. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the 2012\u201313 FA Cup fourth round, Luton won their away tie against Premier League club Norwich City 1\u20130 and, in doing so, became the first non-League team to beat a side from England's top division since 1989. In the 2013\u201314 season, under the management of John Still, Luton won the Conference Premier title with three games to spare, and thereby secured a return to the Football League from 2014\u201315. After reaching the League Two play-offs in 2016\u201317, when they were beaten 6\u20135 on aggregate by Blackpool in the semi-final, Luton were promoted back to League One the following season as runners-up.
