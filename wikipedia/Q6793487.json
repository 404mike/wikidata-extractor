In 1939, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo settled in St Ives, attracted by its beauty. In 1993, a branch of the Tate Gallery, the Tate St Ives, opened. The Tate has also owned the Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden since 1980. The town attracted artists from overseas such as Maurice Sumray who moved from London in 1968,  and Piet Mondrian, and continues to do so today with younger artists such as Michael Polat, who took up residence there from his native Germany in 1999."]}]}}
