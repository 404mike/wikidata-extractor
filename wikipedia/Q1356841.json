In exchange for the lost bishop, Black is only able to obtain two pawns (see chess piece relative value). Gligori\u0107, Kasparov and other commentators have suggested that Fischer may have miscalculated, having planned 30...h5 31.Ke2 h4 32.Kf3 h3 33.Kg4 Bg1, but overlooking that 34.Kxh3 Bxf2 35.Bd2 keeps the bishop trapped.Kasparov 2004b, p. 434Gligori\u0107 1972, p. 34 Anatoly Karpov suggested that Spassky was afraid of Fischer and wanted to show that he could draw with the white pieces, while Fischer wanted to disprove that as the game headed for a stale draw.Karpov 1990, p. 100 Owing to unusual features in the position, Fischer had good drawing chances despite having only two pawns for the bishop.Robert Byrne wrote, \"The wonder is that, even though he now loses the bishop for two pawns, he would have been able to draw had it not been for his later mistakes.\" Byrne & Nei 1974, p. 83 But the position became hopeless after he made at least one more bad move (39th and/or 40th, see cited source) before the , which took place after move 40.Mednis 1997, pp. 275\u201376 Fischer could still have drawn the game with the correct 39th or 40th move.Gligori\u0107 1972 (p. 34), Alexander 1972 (p. 86), and Evans & Smith 1973 (p. 29) all give Fischer's 40th move as a bad move, stating that he could still have drawn with the correct 40th move. More recent books by Kasparov 2004b (p. 435) and Plisetsky & Voronkov 2005 (p. 443) give Fischer's 39th move as weak, claiming that his last opportunity to draw the game was with 39...e5!
