MacMahon insisted on having three previously unrecorded acts at the sessions; The Americans, Christine Pizutti and Jerron \u201cBlind Boy\u201d Paxton.", "The film was storyboarded extensively by MacMahon in advance of the shoot along with detailed diagrams of the lighting designs. He explained; \u201cI\u2019d have an idea in advance of what the set-up might be musically so I painted out lighting design and storyboards in advance. Those were in a constant state of flux,\u201d Producer Allison McGourty commented \u201cIt was like a theatrical production\u2014Bernard designed different lighting for each session to give [each song] a different feel.\u201d MacMahon said that he wanted the film to look like a painting \u201cI wanted a rich color palette so it looks like a Vel\u00e1zquez painting,\u201d he said, with the lighting falling off to heavy shadows in the corners of the picture to conceal the dolly tracks in the studio. MacMahon filmed principally on an Arri Alexa on a camera dolly. The decision to have the camera in a constant state of subtle motion was designed to give the film a musical rhythm and momentum. As the musicians in the film were forced to record their tracks in a single unaltered take, MacMahon decided the camera should do the same and choreographed complex single take moves to mirror the tempo of the music whilst landing on the musicians the moment their part came to the foreground. McGourty explained \u201che would rehearse with our house band before the performers arrived, and rehearse the camera crew with all the dolly moves so they would know when the lead vocalist would be singing; then it would go into a chorus, then the guitar or the banjo. There was a huge amount of preparation, because it was not just the music that had to be captured in one three-minute take\u2014we had to capture the whole experience on film, and make it look natural, and do it smoothly enough that we didn\u2019t interfere with the performers.\u201d MacMahon said he took some of his inspiration from John J. Mescall's cinematography on James Whale productions like the Bride of Frankenstein. MacMahon wanted viewers to feel like they were standing in the studio watching the performance, so the camera never moved lower than a crouch or higher than someone standing on their tip toes, nor did the camera zoom in closer than a guest in the studio would stand. A test session was filmed with Frank Fairfield and The Americans to perfect the cinematic style of the film. In stark contrast to this policy was his use of extreme macro photography when the film discusses the recording system.\u00a0Shot using macro lenses, the cinematography used in these sections was designed to take the viewer inside the inner workings of the 1920s Western Electric amplifier and microphone and the 1920s Scully cutting lathe, and to give the recording system a larger than life persona. Exterior shots of the dilapidated and nondescript studio building were occasionally employed with pedestrians walking by oblivious to the activities going on inside. MacMahon said this was to \u201cremind people that behind every door there are a thousand stories.\u201d", "At the outset of the pre-production of the American Epic documentary series there were no known photos or film footage of the full Western Electric system. Locating visual documentation became of paramount importance to the producers. Midway through the research on the film, MacMahon and McGourty were introduced to sound engineer Nicholas Bergh as a possible collaborator. After a year of getting to know each other, Bergh revealed he had spent almost a decade attempting to restore the Western Electric system. Bergh had scavenged spare parts from around the world, in places as far away as Japan and Europe, in his quest to complete the system. \u201cAll the individual items had to come from different places, often thousands of miles apart\u201d he explained \u201cI was able to confirm my progress by studying the few crude music studio pictures that started to show up.\u201d However, Bergh was missing a vital part of the set up \u2013 the pulley driven Scully lathe. On an exploratory trip to the Scully family, looking for photographs, MacMahon and McGourty discovered perhaps the only surviving 1924 Scully lathe in the family's basement and persuaded them to loan it to the production.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 240 MacMahon then set about persuading Bergh to engineer a session with contemporary artists recording on the system. Bergh was nervous about doing this as \u201cmoving that [the recording system] into a production environment, that was a major change.\u201d MacMahon persuaded Bergh to participate in a test session with two new artists so as to limit the pressure. Frank Fairfield and The Americans were the first musicians to record on the system in over 80 years. \u201cThe results were satisfactory\u201d MacMahon explained \u201cbut Nick wanted to operate the machine more effectively\u201d. Producer and co-writer Allison McGourty gained access to the AT&T archive which kept the research documents for Western Electric. Within the archive they located engineers\u2019 casebooks and accounting forms that gave some more clues as to how to operate the machine. They also managed to locate 1920s photographs of the recording system being used in the Western Electric laboratory. Armed with this new information Bergh agreed to MacMahon's plan to attempt to film a full recording session with twenty artists. MacMahon hired T Bone Burnett and Jack White to produce and arrange songs for the sessions and booked all the artists.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 241-243", "Joe Boyd wrote in The Guardian \u201cfor two hours we revel in filmed performances in front of that single microphone, as the camera lovingly follows the sound through anaconda-like cables to the cutting head. As soon as the blank disc starts spinning, our soundtrack switches from the film-maker\u2019s 21st-century handheld digital stereo to the glorious mono of the single microphone. There are no faders; if Burnett or White want more of this musician and a bit less of that one, they move them closer to or away from the microphone.

This antiquated, cleaned up piece of studio equipment is so fetishistically photographed, it relegates the 19 musical acts that drop by for an old-school session to supporting players. Fortunately, it\u2019s a stunt that pays off, in pristine contemporary recordings you can scarcely believe went directly through a cutting stylus direct to disc. Bernard MacMahon, who championed this project for the better part of this century, makes the best case for this beautiful monstrosity of a machine representing the pre-homogeneity democratization of American music.\u201d Robert Lloyd in the Los Angeles Times confided \"I don\u2019t mind telling you I got a little emotional watching this, and you might too.\" Kurt Gardner in Blogcritics called the film \u201cAn amazing journey through musical history. Lovers of music and early Americana alike will be fascinated by Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty\u2019s The American Epic Sessions.

He also viewed the story as fundamental in culturally, creatively and technologically shaping and influencing the modern world. MacMahon said this was the first time America heard itself. He posited that these 1920s recordings \"allowed working people, from Native American farmers to a woman picking cotton in Mississippi, to have their thoughts and feelings distributed on records throughout the whole country. On the modern digital platform, we take that freedom of speech for granted. Back then, it was a revolutionary idea.\"", "MacMahon began extensively researching the period, concentrating on approximately 100 performers who had made recordings in the late 20s and early 30s at the field recording sessions.American Epic (documentary) Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 3 With very little information about the 1920s field recording sessions and the artists involved published in books, MacMahon elected to research almost exclusively in the field by tracking down eyewitnesses and direct family members to piece together the most accurate picture of the events at that time. One of the artists he was endeavoring to track down was Dick Justice. Suspecting that Justice was from West Virginia and a coal miner, MacMahon began running stories in the local newspapers from the 1920s coal mining communities in West Virginia that were still in print. After a number of failed attempts, he ran an advert in the Logan Banner that read, \"British film company looking for relatives of Dick Justice.\" The advert resulted in a response from Bill Williamson who knew Justice's daughter, Ernestine Smith. Ernestine, who was in her late eighties at the time and still living in Logan, had a photograph of her father and dramatic stories of his life in the coal mines and his recording career. Bill Williamson revealed his father was the founder of another legendary group from the period, The Williamson Brothers.American Epic (documentary) Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 104-105 Inspired by what he'd discovered, MacMahon began to pursue other musicians of interest from the era. His production partner Allison McGourty encouraged him to use this research for the basis of a film. She reasoned that this would be the last opportunity to tell these stories before all the direct relatives and witnesses had died. MacMahon, on embarking on this vast research expedition, commented that \"almost a century later, we wanted to see if we could still experience that music directly, among the people who made it, in the places it was played. We started by choosing some artists and recordings that we found particularly moving, then set out to trace them through space and time. At times it seemed a quixotic quest, but as we traveled, we kept being startled by the overlaps of old and new, the ways in which the music of the past continued to resonate and reflect the present. We had left our home in twenty-first-century Britain to travel across a foreign country and deep into the past, but over and over again, the people we met and the places we visited felt very familiar and very much in the present.\"", "All filming for the series was done on location with interviewees shot in places of significance to each story \u2013 on the porch of Maybelle Carter's house in Maces Spring, Virginia for the Carter Family story; in the building of the former Monarch Nightclub in Memphis, Tennessee for the Memphis Jug Band story;[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 50-51 and on the shores of Oahu for the Joseph Kekuku story. The production involved extensive filming trips across 37 states that producer Allison McGourty coordinated \"from Cleveland, Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico, and from New York to Hawaii.\" MacMahon determined a comprehensive anthology of the period was impossible within the time constraints of a documentary film series. Mindful of the vast number of musicians who participated in these recording sessions, MacMahon decided to focus on eleven stories in detail to give the viewer an emotional connection to the musicians and their music, and to their culture and geographical surroundings.American Epic (documentary) Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 4-5 He employed a creative device to demonstrate that the films were a selective exploration; each story began with a leather bound 78rpm record album, of the type used in the 20s, being opened to reveal sleeves containing the disc of the artist that would be the subject of the story, thereby indicating that this story was one of thousands in a vast library. This technique is known as an anthology film. MacMahon said he took his inspiration for this approach from \"one of my favorite films \u2013 Dead of Night.\"", "Dan Gitlin, the senior editor on the films, developed a pacing for the series in collaboration with director Bernard MacMahon to complement the leisurely speaking pace of the elderly interviewees. MacMahon said when Robert Redford offered to narrate the film he knew it would match the editorial style. He described Redford's voice as \"untainted but also very American\" adding that \"he has a very low-key, understated way of speaking that suits this film. His voice has no baggage but it has enormous gravitas; it sounds like Mount Rushmore.\" MacMahon decided to showcase most of the archival music performances in their entirety. He said, \"This technique was employed to allow the viewer to emotionally connect with unfamiliar music smoothly.\" Intense research went into ensuring all the archival film clips and stills were from the correct location and time period of each story. This technique was used to match the music with the landscapes that had inspired it. All the archival film footage and stills were scanned at the highest possible resolution, and extensive restoration work was undertaken on hundreds of rare and damaged photographic stills. Producer Allison McGourty explained that \"it was really to do justice to the people themselves and the families, because for example when we found photos of Mississippi John Hurt or [the Tejano musician] Lydia Mendoza you want the public now to see them as they were then, which was beautiful. You don't want to see them in a raggedy old photograph, so we wanted to do justice to them and once you start doing [restoring] one, you have to do all of them.\" MacMahon was dissatisfied with the contemporary methods of presenting archival film footage in documentaries and innovated a new technique to blend the 4:3 aspect ratio of the 1920s film footage with the 16:9 aspect ratio of his contemporary footage. Traditionally the 4:3 footage had been either panned and scanned to fill the 16:9 screen, losing the top and bottom of the image, or reproduced intact with pillarboxing, resulting in black bars on either side of the frame. To overcome this, MacMahon overscanned the nitrate film revealing the edges of the frame and created mattes out of scans of the black leader from the same film reel to create a 16:9 frame. This new technique, called \"Epic Scans\" gave a full-screen appearance to archival film clips without losing any of the images, allowing the viewer to experience these clips as they were originally intended but on a widescreen format without cropping or black bars.MacMahon, Bernard (October 7, 2018). \"The Making of American Epic - 2018 Tryon International Film Festival\".

American Epic is an ambitious project led by film director and producer Bernard MacMahon. His mission to trace the history of the origins of American popular music. The final result of this work co-produced with Arte, BBC Arena, and the ZDF, is impressive, with exceptional film and sound archives, as well as unpublished testimonies spread over three and a half hours.\" Steve Appleford in Rolling Stone described the series as \"The Lawrence of Arabia of music documentaries\" adding that \"the goal was not simply to retell the Wikipedia version of the story. MacMahon and producer Allison McGourty spent a decade seeking original sources in the field, going from family to family. They discovered artifacts and previously unknown photographs of such originators as Son House, the Memphis Jug Band, and West Virginia mine workers the Williamson Brothers and Dick Justice.\" Garth Cartwright in Songlines stated that \"as a connoisseur of American music I'm constantly surprised by some of the musical treasure American Epic discovers and shares. Not least the Hopi Indian snake dance footage of a performance in front of the Capitol in Washington, DC in 1926, a stunning find.\"", "Joe Boyd in The Guardian praised the series as \"remarkable ... American Epic, tells the story of how this existential moment for the music industry coincided with the arrival of electrical recording. Victor and Okeh Records' response to the crisis laid the groundwork for popular music as we know it today. Filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty have focused on key individuals and archetypal stories, bringing the characters and times to life with great sensitivity and thoroughness. Here, we see the birth of 'race records' and country music, two strands of the fast-expanding record industry that converged, in 1954, with Elvis and rock 'n' roll. The series shows us how the record industry introduced America to its true self, selling hundreds of thousands of records in cities as well as in the sticks, and creating a worldwide taste for the rural roots of urban music. While the first three parts of the series delve into history, making up for the absence of live footage with great interviews and a stunning assemblage of photographs, the fourth crowns the achievement with something different. Miss it at your peril.\" Jonathan Webster in Long Live Vinyl wrote, \"An Anglo-American team of documentary filmmakers, led by producer Allison McGourty and director Bernard MacMahon, set out on an epic journey to explore the huge variety of folk, rural and rregional music recorded in the United States during the late 1920s, culminating in a magnificent BBC TV series called American Epic\" adding \"with wins and nominations already earned at various film festivals, including Calgary and Sydney, it's a safe bet American Epic is going to carve a niche in the pantheon of TV's great documentaries.\" Ben Sandmel in Know Louisiana pointed out that \"instead of presenting a host of music experts as talking heads, American Epic takes a novel and commendably populist approach by interviewing descendants of the featured musicians, or people who actually knew them. The most effective use of this technique can be seen in a segment about Elder J. E. Burch, a deeply soulful gospel singer from Cheraw, South Carolina. In Cheraw, director Bernard McMahon interviewed an elderly man named Ted Bradley, who had been a member of Burch's congregation. The scene where Bradley sees a photo of Burch for the first time in seventy years is truly touching, and such moments stand among the series' greatest strengths.\""]}, {"page": "Music from The American Epic Sessions: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack", "response": ["The American Epic Sessions film and soundtrack was conceived by director Bernard MacMahon as a practical implementation of the music and technology explored in the first three American Epic films which focused on the first recordings of roots music in the USA in the 1920s. Film producer Allison McGourty explained, \"if the first three American Epic films are like the story of the Apollo [first manned moon landing] mission, with unseen film footage, interviews with the astronauts and scientists, then\u2026The American Epic Sessions, is where we rebuild the rocket and go to the moon ourselves.\" MacMahon added that the idea for The American Epic Sessions film and the soundtrack album was born out of a desire to understand on a practical level how the first electrical recordings in the 1920s were made, \u201cyou can only truly appreciate history, and understand why things were done the way they were done, by actually going out and doing them yourself.\u201d[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 255 The soundtrack album involved replicating a 1920s recording session, down to the smallest detail, with twenty-three contemporary music acts recording live on the original 1920s equipment in back to back sessions just as the original rural performers would have done over 80 years ago. The film and soundtrack involved a decade of work restoring the machine, which was pieced together from spare parts scattered across the globe. MacMahon invited Jack White and T Bone Burnett to produce the sessions,[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 241-243 and secured the use of Vox studios in Hollywood, purportedly the oldest private recording studio in the world, built in 1936, to film and record the live performances.", "At the outset of the pre-production of the American Epic documentary series there were no known photos or film footage of the Western Electric system. Midway through the research on the film, MacMahon was introduced to sound engineer Nicholas Bergh as a possible collaborator. Bergh revealed that he had spent almost a decade attempting to restore the Western Electric system,[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 238-239 scavenging spare parts from around the world in places as far away as Japan and Europe in his quest to complete the system. \u201cAll the individual items had to come from different places, often thousands of miles apart\u201d he explained, \u201cI was able to confirm my progress by studying the few crude music studio pictures that started to show up.\u201d However, Bergh was missing a vital part of the set up \u2013 the pulley driven Scully lathe. On an exploratory trip to the Scully family looking for photographs, MacMahon discovered in the family\u2019s basement perhaps the only surviving 1924 Scully lathe and persuaded them to loan it to the production.[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 240 MacMahon then set about persuading Bergh to engineer a session with contemporary artists recording on the system. Bergh was nervous about doing this as \u201cmoving that [the recording system] into a production environment, that was a major change.\u201d MacMahon persuaded Bergh to participate in a test session with two new artists so as to limit the pressure. Frank Fairfield and The Americans were the first musicians to record on the system in over 80 years.[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 240-241 \u201cThe results were satisfactory\u201d MacMahon explained, \u201cbut Nick wanted to operate the machine more effectively\u201d. Producer and co-writer Allison McGourty gained access to the AT&T archive which kept the research documents for Western Electric. Within the archive they located engineers\u2019 casebooks and accounting forms that gave some more clues as to how to operate the machine. They also managed to locate 1920s photographs of the recording system being used in the Western Electric laboratory.
