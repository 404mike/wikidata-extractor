He made ambition plans for the 1975\u201376 season, though he failed to land Wales internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies. Instead he signed striker Mick Cullerton from Stafford Rangers for \u00a34,000, and midfielders Terry Lees (a \u00a33,000 signing from Stoke City) and Geoff Morris (a \u00a3200 signing from Bangor City).

The defence was strengthened with the signings of David Harris, Keith Chadwick and John Ridley. In January, Lee took the job at Blackburn Rovers. The appointment of Roy Sproson as his replacement marked a great change for the dressing room atmosphere, as Sproson was more relaxed and insisted upon a more 'entertaining' style of play. Ill discipline on the pitch caused Sproson to arrange a lecture by a local referee to calm his players down and avoid bookings. The club finished poorly, though avoided relegation. New signings for 1974\u201375 included Terry Bailey, Frank Sharp and John Connaughton. The club pushed for promotion, but registered another sixth-place finish, again four points from promotion. This time it was their away form that cost them.", "A dire financial situation meant seven players were released for 1975\u201376: John Woodward, Tony Lacey, Roy Cross, Bill Summerscales, Frank Sharp and Reg Edwards. Attempts to sign Wales  internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies failed, and so Mick Cullerton, Terry Lees and Geoff Morris were the only new signings. Cullerton was in fine scoring form, though the promotion campaign fell away and Horton was sold to Brighton for \u00a330,000, which led to a healthy profit on the season. For the club's centenary celebrations a match was held with Stoke City, which finished 1\u20131, an impressive result considering the \"Potters\" were going through one of the most successful periods in their history."]}, {"page": "Frank Sharp", "response": ["Frank Sharp may refer to:", "* Frank Sharp (land developer) (1906\u20131993), American land developer and businessman involved in the Sharpstown scandal", "* Frank Sharp (footballer, born 1947), Scottish football winger with clubs including Barnsley", "* Frank Sharp (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131963), English football forward with Birmingham and Chesterfield"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw Roy Sproson attempt to construct a new attacking style by signing attacking midfielder Terry Bailey from Stafford Rangers for \u00a32,500, winger Frank Sharp from Grimsby Town, and goalkeeper John Connaughton from Sheffield United.
