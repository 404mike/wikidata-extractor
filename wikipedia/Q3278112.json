Working closely with Dorothea Bate, she demonstrated a long sequence of Lower Palaeolithic, Middle Palaeolithic and Epipalaeolithic occupations in the caves of Tabun, El Wad, Es Skhul, Shuqba (Shuqbah) and Kebara Cave. She also coined the cultural label for the late Epipalaeolithic Natufian culture (from Wadi an-Natuf, the location of the Shuqba cave) following her excavations at Es Skhul and El Wad. Her excavations at the cave sites in the Levant were conducted with almost exclusively women workers recruited from local villages.

Three such deposits were found, which yielded fragmentary remains of Myotragus, including a mostly complete skull, associated with a mandible and atlas vertebra, which was designated the type specimen of the new species and genus Myotragus balearicus.

Her interest in archaeology began on a trip to Egypt with her mother in 1911, followed by a series of lectures on Ancient Greece given by Sarah Paterson at the British Museum. An inheritance received in 1912 helped ensure her financial independence and support her later excavations. Caton Thompson's first experience in the field came in 1915 working as a bottle washer in an excavation in France. During World War I, she worked for the British Ministry of Shipping as part of which she attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

It is believed to have been omnivorous, with a generalist diet and with an ability to eat hard foods. Its limb bones are robust and dissimilar in morphology to extant Gliridae, suggesting an unusual form of locomotion, with the proportions being closest to that of the Gran Canaria giant rat. It may have been terrestrial rather than arboreal, and it has been suggested that it had fossorial capabilities. The arrival of humans on the island is believed to have been a major factor in its extinction. H. morpheus was described by the palaeontologist Dorothea Bate in 1919.
