He was born in Liverpool, Lancashire (now Merseyside).His other TV credits include The Saint, The Avengers, The Sweeney, Lord Peter Wimsey (The Nine Tailors), Space: 1999, Only Fools and Horses, Wyatt's Watchdogs, Edge of Darkness, Coronation Street and Lovejoy.Jackson made two appearances in Minder. His first appearance was in 1979 as Big Stan in the episode The Smaller They Are. This was followed by a further appearance in 1985, in the episode Give Us This Day Arthur Daley's Bread, in which he played an ex-con named Marion.His film credits include roles in 10 Rillington Place (1971), Unman, Wittering and Zigo (1971), Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971), Night Watch (1973), The Big Sleep (1978) and the cult horror film Killer's Moon (1978).In 2002, he provided his voice talent to the audio drama Sarah Jane Smith: Comeback, part of the Doctor Who audio spin-offs by Big Finish Productions. Jackson was a science-fiction fan throughout his career and was happy to be associated with Blake's 7 years after the series ended.\nIn 1988 he played the Vicar alongside Brian Wilde in six episodes of the BBC1 sitcom Wyatt's Watchdogs. His great passion was for Victorian theatre and at one stage he produced and starred in a one-man show. Other theatre appearances included roles at the Old Vic, the Royal Court, the RSC and in the West End.David Jackson died of a heart attack on 25 July 2005, aged 71.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blake's 7", "response": ["*Olag Gan, played by David Jackson (series 1\u20132).

It was decided that one of the regular characters should die, to demonstrate that Blake and his crew were not invincible. Gan, played by David Jackson, was chosen because Gan had been under-used and was the least popular character. Although ratings declined compared to the first series, the BBC commissioned a third. When Gareth Thomas and Sally Knyvette decided not to return, new characters were required so that the story could continue without its titular character. Suggestions for a replacement actor for Blake were rejected and Avon became more prominent in the story.
