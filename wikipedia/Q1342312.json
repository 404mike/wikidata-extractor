However, he later returned to music when the Stone Roses reformed in 2011.\nSquire has been described as one of the most accomplished and influential British rock guitarists of the late 1980s and early 1990s, known for his chiming melodies, spiraling riffs and live solos.

Mostly written by John Squire, the music now had a shady, heavy blues rock sound. \"Love Spreads\" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. Second Coming received a mixed reception from the British press, which music journalist Simon Reynolds attributed to \"the resentment that the Roses, divorced from the cultural moment that gave them meaning, were now just another band\".", "In March 1995, just two weeks before a tour in support of Second Coming was due to begin, Reni exited the band, following a disagreement with Ian Brown.

A major blow was the cancellation of their engagement at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1995.

The band continued for another six months, but there was a noticeable deterioration in the quality of its public performances after Squire's loss, and at Benicassim Festival and the Reading Festival Brown's voice was described as \"so off-key it was excruciating to have to listen\". The music press was united in its criticism, the NME describing \"I Am the Resurrection\" as \"more like the eternal crucifixion\".Perrone, Pierre (2008) \"The worst gigs of all time\", The Independent, 24 January 2008 Brown and Mani dissolved the group in October 1996.", "Ian Brown, John Squire and Mani have all had successful careers since the Roses' breakup.

By the late 80s Squire had tired of the overly angular guitar riffs which dominated British music and had bought a wah wah pedal to soften the Roses sound.

It originally received little attention from both consumers and critics in the United Kingdom, with the exception of NME and Melody Maker, who were covering the Madchester music scene at the time. Bob Stanley from Melody Maker called it \"godlike\" and said the foundation of the music was John Squire's guitar playing, which he deemed \"beautifully flowing, certainly psychedelic, there are elements of Hendrix (especially on 'Shoot You Down') and Marr (check out the fade to 'Bye Bye Badman'), but the rest is the lad's own work\". In Q, Peter Kane was less favourable and felt that The Stone Roses was a promising album weighed down by \"strangely monotone production\", while NME journalist Jack Barron wrote that it was merely \"quite good\" while giving it a score of seven on a scale of 10; the latter magazine later ranked it as the second best record of 1989 in their year-end list. In The Village Voice, American critic Robert Christgau wrote that the group was \"overhyped\" and no different from the numerous indie bands in the United States, adding \"what do they do that the Byrds and the Buffalo Springfield weren't doing better in 1967?\" He concluded that \"they're surprisingly 'eclectic.'

Wren's use of a smaller kit did not limit his range, with a new focus on a jazz-tinged, but ultimately rock-based, playing style. His busy use of the high-hat, snare, and solitary tom-tom created a complex sound which helped to define the band's significant musical shift.", "By the time of the Second Coming rehearsals, in the early 1990s, Wren adapted his style further. Guitarist John Squire, becoming increasingly inspired by Led Zeppelin, led the band in a new musical direction, prompting Wren to adopt a blues-rock approach, adding in extra tom-toms for a style analogous to John Bonham. Ian Brown said of early studio time: \"When we started recording we had Reni playing the drums for 40 minutes and it was out of this world. I remember John Leckie turning around with a big beam on his face and saying, 'Can't this be the album?'\"Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 200, Penguin Books, 2012 His playing on the songs \"Love Spreads\" and \"Daybreak\" were particularly praised for their high-quality and complexity, whilst his many long jamming sessions with Mani and Squire, plus several drum solos, also became available through bootlegs.", "Once again, the band briefly toured in early 2017 with the final show playing at Glasgow in June.

Those records are far more than anyone else is going to do, but I think it\u2019s kind of sad that he\u2019s not made a full record since Second Coming and may never do again.
