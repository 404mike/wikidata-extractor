His preferred position is as a left-sided midfielder.\nStarting his career as an Everton trainee, by 2000 he made his way into first team contention. Unable to establish himself at the Premier League side he joined Queens Park Rangers in 2003, following two successful loan spells. After two seasons with QPR, he then spent a season with Swansea City. In 2006, he moved on to Colchester United, where he spent another two years before moving on again, this time to Brighton & Hove Albion. His time at Brighton was rather less successful than at his previous clubs, and he departed in 2010 for a brief spell at Wycombe Wanderers. As of September 2010 he was playing for Redbridge in the Ryman One North.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Redbridge F.C.", "response": ["|Kevin McLeod  12"]}, {"page": "Garston, Liverpool", "response": ["*Kevin McLeod, professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Special Duties", "response": ["In 2007 the band re-recorded the \"Up the U's!\" with local band Koopa with a song entitled \"Stand Up For Col U\" by Koopa and with the vocals of Colchester United players Jamie Cureton, Chris Iwelumo, Wayne Brown, Karl Duguid, Kevin Watson, Pat Baldwin, Kevin McLeod and Dean Gerken.
