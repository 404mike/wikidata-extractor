While at Reading, he was part of the team that narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League in the 1994\u201395 season, losing 4\u20133 after extra time in the playoff final against Bolton Wanderers.\nFollowing Reading's playoff defeat, Taylor refused a new contract, and was sold to Leicester City, aiding them in their promotion to the Premier League. He also played as Leicester were victorious in the 1997 Football League Cup Final. After an injury-blighted 1997\u201398 season, he moved on a free transfer to Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, injuries took their toll, so Taylor retired from professional football to play non-league football for Cambridge City and Hayes, before fully retiring in 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scott Taylor", "response": ["Scott Taylor may refer to:", "* Scott Taylor (Australian footballer) (born 1976), Australian rules footballer for the Western Bulldogs", "* Scott Taylor (darts player) (born 1991), English darts player", "* Scott Taylor (footballer, born 1970), English football player", "* Scott Taylor (footballer, born 1976), English football player", "* Scott Taylor (left-handed pitcher) (born 1967), MLB left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, 1992\u20131993", "* Scott Taylor (pentathlete) (born 1945), American modern pentathlete", "* Scott Taylor (racing driver) (born 1955), professional off-road racing driver", "* Scott Taylor (right-handed pitcher) (born 1966), MLB right-handed pitcher for the Texas Rangers, 1995", "* Scott Taylor (rugby league) (born 1991), rugby league player for Hull FC", "* Scott Garland (wrestler) (born 1973), professional wrestler who used the ring name Scott Taylor", "* Scott Taylor (actor) (born 1982), English actor", "* Scott Taylor (journalist) (born 1960), Canadian journalist", "* Scott Taylor (politician) (born 1979), Virginia politician", "* Scott Taylor (writer), Australian television writer", "* M.
