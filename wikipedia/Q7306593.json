In 1920, the rooms were purchased from the original private company by wealthy local industrialist Sir George Wills and given to the University to house the students' union. It appears that the University briefly leased the building for use as the Clifton Cinema which was situated there in March 1924, when local photographer Reece Winstone took a photograph.  All seats were priced at 1/3d. The Victoria Rooms remained the base for the student union until 1964 when a purpose-built facility was constructed in nearby Queen's Road. The building then became a conference and exhibition centre, hosting occasional concerts such as those by Pink Floyd in 1967 and 1969.  In 1987 the building housed the first incarnation of the Exploratory founded by Richard Gregory \u2013 a hands-on science centre and precursor of At-Bristol \u2013 until 1989. The University Music Department was moved into the Victoria Rooms in 1996."]}, {"page": "The Old Lodge, Bristol", "response": ["The Old Lodge, also known as the Thatched Cottage and 166 Henleaze Road, is a notable landmark in Henleaze in Bristol, England.

Although his work has been relatively neglected by historians, there are several of his photographs housed in museums and private collections, in the City of Bristol archives, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City; the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Building on a collection of Owen\u2019s photographs made by the Bristol photographer and historian, Reece Winstone, an exhibition of his landscapes, entitled Hugh Owen Rediscovered, was held in New York City in 2016, the first exhibition devoted to his work since the 19th century. Winstone had been seeking copies of Owen\u2019s photographs since the 1950s. In 1962, an elderly gentleman, W. L. Venn, attended an exhibition by Winstone at the Bristol Cooperative Society. Venn had worked for the amateur archaeologist, Canon R. T. Cole and had purchased his collection of Owen\u2019s work when Cole died. He gave that album, containing 100 photographs, to Winstone for his collection, by leaving it at the reception of the Cooperative Society."]}]}}
