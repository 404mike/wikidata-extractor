He was the most favoured architect of the Church of England in New South Wales for much of his career, and between late 1849 and 1854 was the official \"Colonial Architect to New South Wales\".\nWhile Blacket is famous for his churches, and is sometimes referred to as \"The Wren of Sydney\", he also built houses, ranging from small cottages to multi-storey terraces and large mansions; government buildings; bridges; and business premises of all sorts. Blacket's architectural practice was highly influential in the development of Australian architecture. He worked with a number of other architects of both Australian and international importance: James Barnet, William Wardell and John Horbury Hunt. Among his children, Arthur, Owen and Cyril followed him into the profession. The successful architect William Kemp also trained in his practice.Edmund Blacket is regarded by descendants of the Blackett family as \"a man of the strictest probity with a great love for his profession, who also studied the classics, and was considered the leading authority on Classical Greek in Sydney, loved music, playing the organ at the temporary wooden pro-Cathedral, was a competent wood-carver and an amateur mechanical engineer\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
