He had also studied botany and became a respected member of the French botanical fraternity. While studying he accompanied Adrien-Henri de Jussieu (1797-1853) on numerous botanizing expeditions and he became a collaborator with Ernest Cosson (1819-1889) and Jacques Germain de Saint-Pierre (1815-1882) in the preparation of Flore des environs de Paris (1845). In 1843, he was invited to join the expedition of Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau to South America, and he explored and collected botanical specimens on that continent for five years.\n\nIn May 1845, Weddell left the expedition which was then in Paraguay, and proceeded on a solitary journey which would take him into Peru and Bolivia. Before leaving Paris, he had been particularly instructed by the Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle to undertake a thorough investigation of the Cinchona plant, or \"fever bark\" tree in its native habitat. Cinchona, the source of quinine, was of great commercial importance and Europeans had been investigating it for nearly two hundred years with the goal of cultivating it in regions far removed from the Andes mountains. Weddell explored a number of regions where the trees grew and identified no fewer than fifteen distinct species of the genus Cinchona (Rubiaceae). The seeds which he took back to Paris were germinated in the Jardin des Plantes, and the plants were used to establish Cinchona forests in Java and elsewhere in the East Indies.\nIn 1847 he married Manuela Bolognesi, a resident of Arequipa. By March 1848 he had returned to Paris, leaving his wife in South America.\nIn Paris, Weddell was given the post of assistant naturalist at the museum.  He held this office until 1853. Weddell made a second trip to South America in 1851.  He returned to France and died on 22 July 1877 in Poitiers, while caring for his father.\nHe is commemorated in the names of a number of plants and animals, including the dusky-headed parakeet, Aratinga weddellii, and the Andean plant Diplostephium weddellii S.F.Blake (Compositae).\nThis botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Wedd. when citing a botanical name.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Hugh Algernon Weddell (1819\u20131877), English physician and botanistAbbreviation in botany: Wedd. specializing in  South American flora"]}, {"page": "Cinchona", "response": ["The \"fever tree\" was finally described carefully by the astronomer Charles Marie de la Condamine, who visited Quito in 1735 on a quest to measure an arc of the meridian. The species he described, Cinchona officinalis, was, however, found to be of little therapeutic value. The first living plants seen in Europe were C. calisaya plants grown at the Jardin des Plantes from seeds collected by Hugh Algernon Weddell from Bolivia in 1846. Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis, physician to the Viceroy of Nueva Granada, Pedro Messia de la Cerda, gathered information on cinchona in Colombia from 1760 and wrote a manuscript, El Arcano de la Quina (1793), with illustrations. He proposed a Spanish expedition to search for plants of commercial value, which was approved in 1783 and was continued after his death in 1808 by his nephew Sinforoso Mutis. As demand for the bark increased, the trees in the forests began to be destroyed. To maintain their monopoly on cinchona bark, Peru and surrounding countries began outlawing the export of cinchona seeds and saplings beginning in the early 19th century."]}, {"page": "Jesuit's bark", "response": ["The western history of cinchona bark dates back more than 350 years. Circa 1650, the physician Sebastiano Bado declared that this bark had proved more precious to mankind than all the gold and silver that the Spaniards had obtained from South America. In the 18th century, the Italian professor of medicine Ramazzini said that the introduction of Peruvian bark would be of the same importance to medicine that the discovery of gunpowder was to the art of war, an opinion endorsed by contemporary writers on the history of medicine. The value of Jesuit's bark, and the controversy surrounding it, were both recognized by Benjamin Franklin, who wittily commented upon it in his Poor Richard's Almanac for October 1749, telling the story of Robert Talbot's use of it to cure the French Dauphin. Hugh Algernon Weddell observed, \"Few subjects in natural history have excited general interest in a higher degree than cinchona; none perhaps have hitherto merited the attention of a greater number of distinguished men\". Dissension, however, was rife at the time, mainly due to its source of discovery, the Jesuits. Alexander von Humboldt said, \"It almost goes without saying that among Protestant physicians hatred of the Jesuits and religious intolerance lie at the bottom of the long conflict over the good or harm effected by Peruvian Bark\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Ledger", "response": ["Ledger returned to South America in 1864 and turned his attention to another problem. The cinchona tree, the bark of which yields quinine, grew in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, but the export of either trees or seeds was prohibited. The trees were being wastefully cut down without being replaced, and there was some danger that they might become extinct. Some seeds and plants had been introduced into Europe and Asia by Hugh Algernon Weddell in 1848, and Sir Clements Markham went later to Peru, and Bolivia, and succeeded in acclimatizing trees in Asia and the Dutch East Indies."]}, {"page": "Wedd.", "response": ["#redirect Hugh Algernon Weddell"]}, {"page": "Dendrocnide moroides", "response": ["The type specimen for this species was collected in 1819 by Allan Cunningham near the Endeavour River, and was first described in 1857 by Hugh Algernon Weddell as Laportea moroides  in his work Monographie de la Famille des Urtic\u00e9es, published in the journal Archives du Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire Naturelle.
