He had also studied botany and became a respected member of the French botanical fraternity. While studying he accompanied Adrien-Henri de Jussieu (1797-1853) on numerous botanizing expeditions and he became a collaborator with Ernest Cosson (1819-1889) and Jacques Germain de Saint-Pierre (1815-1882) in the preparation of Flore des environs de Paris (1845). In 1843, he was invited to join the expedition of Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau to South America, and he explored and collected botanical specimens on that continent for five years.\n\nIn May 1845, Weddell left the expedition which was then in Paraguay, and proceeded on a solitary journey which would take him into Peru and Bolivia. Before leaving Paris, he had been particularly instructed by the Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle to undertake a thorough investigation of the Cinchona plant, or \"fever bark\" tree in its native habitat. Cinchona, the source of quinine, was of great commercial importance and Europeans had been investigating it for nearly two hundred years with the goal of cultivating it in regions far removed from the Andes mountains. Weddell explored a number of regions where the trees grew and identified no fewer than fifteen distinct species of the genus Cinchona (Rubiaceae). The seeds which he took back to Paris were germinated in the Jardin des Plantes, and the plants were used to establish Cinchona forests in Java and elsewhere in the East Indies.\nIn 1847 he married Manuela Bolognesi, a resident of Arequipa. By March 1848 he had returned to Paris, leaving his wife in South America.\nIn Paris, Weddell was given the post of assistant naturalist at the museum.  He held this office until 1853. Weddell made a second trip to South America in 1851.  He returned to France and died on 22 July 1877 in Poitiers, while caring for his father.\nHe is commemorated in the names of a number of plants and animals, including the dusky-headed parakeet, Aratinga weddellii, and the Andean plant Diplostephium weddellii S.F.Blake (Compositae).\nThis botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Wedd. when citing a botanical name.", "link_mentions": {}}}
