He operated a press at \"The Sign of The Dolphin next to Dr Johnson's House in Gough Square\", London and designed the custom typeface \"Venezia\", one of many fine printing types of the period based on the work of fifteenth-century engraver Nicolas Jenson. At his home in Monkbarns, Northwood, Middlesex, he built up a notable library, which he printed a catalogue of for the use of visitors; it was sold at auction in 1936.In 1921, he was hired by the British branch of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company to develop new and more elegant typefaces that would enhance their reputation; at the time hot metal typesetting machines were not fully accepted by fine printers who generally used hand-set foundry type. His projects included Granjon and Estienne, two families based on the typefaces of the French renaissance, a Baskerville revival, and Georgian. Later Linotype employee Walter Tracy praised these designs, noting his partnership with Linotype draughtsman Harry Smith, who drew production drawings for the typefaces at Linotype's Altrincham factory, as a major partner in their success.Jones married Eliza Sophia Ann Durham, who predeceased him in 1912. He retired in 1938 and died at Droitwich Spa in his home county of Worcestershire on 14 May 1942. He is buried at Holy Trinity Church, Northwood, with his wife.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northwood, London", "response": ["* George W.
