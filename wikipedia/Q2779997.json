He played as a half back for Manchester City and Wrexham. On the books of Birmingham City as a youth, Barnes began his football career at amateur level. Upon completion of his national service in 1947 he joined semi-pro Stafford Rangers.\nA transfer to Manchester City in 1950 meant Barnes turned professional, but his pro career had a slow start, making only one first team appearance in four years. He broke into the first team in 1954, flourishing as part of the tactical system known as the Revie Plan. During this period he played in two consecutive FA Cup finals, as a loser in 1955 and a winner in 1956. After making 283 appearances for Manchester City he joined Wrexham as player-manager in 1961, guiding them to promotion in his first season. Barnes returned to Manchester City in 1970, and over more than two decades filled a variety of coaching roles, including overseeing the development of the youth team which won the 1986 FA Youth Cup.\nHe died on 13 July 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stanley Matthews", "response": ["Stoke City arranged a testimonial match in honour of Matthews; it was much needed as he had spent most of his career constricted to the tight maximum wage that had been enforced upon the English game and only abolished a few years before his retirement.

The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, pp. 157\u2013158."]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["Revie had improved his goal tally to 13 in the 1953\u201354 season, but only once the Revie Plan was implemented in the 1954\u201355 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities. The new tactic opened with a 5\u20130 defeat to Preston North End, but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside-forward and the team clicked. Though the tactic was named after Revie, it had initially been introduced at reserve team level by Johnny Williamson, though Revie's superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level. City's league title campaign fell away but they went on to reach the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3\u20131 by Newcastle United; a first-half injury to Jimmy Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively. At the end of the season Revie was named as FWA Footballer of the Year.", "McDowall fined Revie \u00a327 for missing two weeks of training for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie for much of the 1955\u201356 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3\u20131 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956\u201357 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road."]}, {"page": "Peter Barnes (footballer)", "response": ["Peter Simon Barnes (born 10 June 1957) is an English former international footballer, and the son of renowned coach and scout Ken Barnes.

Colombian clubs, who were not required to pay transfer fees as their governing body was not affiliated with FIFA, made similar offers to several British players. Paul was one of seven to make the trip to South America. Millonarios offered him a \u00a33,000 signing on fee and \u00a3150 per month, far in excess of the \u00a312 per week maximum wage in British football. The maximum wage was set at \u00a312 in 1947, and raised to \u00a314 in 1951. Once in Colombia, Paul found himself unimpressed by the conditions. He remarked in his autobiography that seeing football pitches surrounded by barbed wire put him in mind of \"a concentration camp, or maybe the monkey-house in the zoo\".A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 26. Paul stayed in Bogota for only ten days, without playing a single match.Moving with the Ball, p. 61. Swansea were angered by Paul's trip, and transfer-listed him upon his return.Manchester City Greats, p. 40. As a result, he transferred to Manchester City for \u00a319,500, a British record for a half-back. Ken Barnes joined the club on the same day. The two became close friends; Paul was best man at Barnes' wedding.", "Promotion meant Paul was playing club football at the highest level for the first time. For the next three seasons, his club languished in the lower reaches of the league table. During one spell of particularly poor form in 1953, newspapers wrote of a feud between Paul and his team-mate Ivor Broadis. Paul was critical of Broadis, a talented inside-forward, but one who in Paul's view did not exert sufficient effort when defending.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 57. In the 1954\u201355 pre-season a new tactic was introduced which would change the direction of the club. Inspired by the Hungary team which had beaten England 6\u20133 the previous year, the club's reserves had used a tactical system in which Johnny Williamson was used as a deep-lying centre-forward, resulting in a lengthy unbeaten run. p. 131. Manchester City manager Les McDowall decided to try the system at first team level, using Don Revie in the centre-forward role. Henceforth the system became known as The Revie Plan. The opening match of the season resulted in a 5\u20130 defeat at the hands of Preston North End. The following match the system was tweaked with Ken Barnes picked in place of John McTavish.Trautmann: The Biography, p.\u00a0159. City beat Sheffield United 5\u20132, and the system was retained for the remainder of the season. Paul's tactical role was relatively unchanged compared to that of some of his team-mates, but as captain he was responsible for retaining the cohesion of his players. The Manchester Guardian regarded Paul to be well suited to the system, calling it \"a strategy which shows off to perfection the strength and maturity of Paul among his younger defenders\".", "Paul had a reputation as a physically tough player and inspirational captain. Team-mate Ken Barnes described him as a player who was \"more about power than guile\", and called him a \"born leader\" who was \"brilliant in the air\".This Simple Game, p. 44.
