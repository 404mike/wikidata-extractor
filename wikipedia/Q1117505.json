It revolves around 16-year-old Sarah (Jennifer Connelly)'s quest to reach the center of an enormous otherworldly maze to rescue her infant half-brother Toby, whom Sarah accidentally wished away to Jareth, the Goblin King (David Bowie). Most of the film's main characters are played by puppets produced by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, apart from Bowie and Connelly.", "The film's concept designer Brian Froud has stated that the character of Jareth was influenced by a diverse range of literary sources. In his afterword to the 20th anniversary edition of The Goblins of Labyrinth, Froud wrote that Jareth references \"the romantic figures of Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights and a brooding Rochester from Jane Eyre\" and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Bowie's costumes were intentionally eclectic, drawing on the image of Marlon Brando's leather jacket from The Wild One as well as that of a knight \"with the worms of death eating through his armor\" from Grimms' Fairy Tales. In his audio commentary of Labyrinth, Froud said that Jareth also has influences from Kabuki theatre.", "The film's conceptual designer Brian Froud says that Labyrinth was first discussed between himself and director Jim Henson. Both agreed to work on another project together, and Froud suggested that the film should feature goblins. On the same journey, Froud \"pictured a baby surrounded by goblins\" and this strong visual image, along with Froud's insight that goblins traditionally steal babies, provided the basis for the film's plot.", "Henson stated that, \"I wanted to put two characters of flesh and bone in the middle of all these artificial creatures, and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterize the adult world.\" Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson pursued Bowie for the role of Jareth and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Bowie discussed why he was involved in the film, stating that, \"I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies, so I was pretty hooked from the beginning.\"", "Labyrinth opened in U.S. theaters on June 27, 1986. The film received a Royal Charity premiere at the London Film Festival on December 1, 1986, with Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales in attendance.

The 2007 release was promoted as an Anniversary Edition and featured a commentary by Brian Froud and two newly produced making-of documentaries, \"Journey Through the Labyrinth: Kingdom of Characters\" and \"Journey Through the Labyrinth: The Quest for Goblin City\" which featured interviews with producer George Lucas, choreographer Gates McFadden of Star Trek fame (listed as Cheryl McFadden), and Brian Henson.", "Several critics noted the film's subtext and found it successful to varying degrees. Saw Tek Meng of the New Strait Times acknowledged that \"Sarah's experiences in the labyrinth are symbolic of her transition from child to woman\" but ultimately found the film \"too linear\" for its latent themes to come through. The New York Times Nina Darnton compared the film's tone to the writings of E. T. A. Hoffmann, stating that Hoffman's The Nutcracker \"is also about the voyage to womanhood, including the hint of sexual awakening, which Sarah experiences too in the presence of a goblin king.\" Darton enjoyed the film and considered it more successful than Henson's previous collaboration with Brian Froud The Dark Crystal.", "Labyrinth was translated to various forms of tie-in media upon release. The Goblins of Labyrinth is a book containing Brian Froud's concept art for the film with descriptions by Terry Jones.

In early stages of development, there were plans for the novel to integrate music into the plot in some way. David Bowie was approached by Archaia to seek permission to use his likeness and ascertain if he wished to have any involvement in the project. Brian Froud was set to design characters as a creative consultant on the project and produce covers for the graphic novel.

The film's conceptual roots lay in Henson's short-lived The Land of Gorch, which also took place in an alien world with no human characters.

C. H. Smith. Henson took a keen interest in the novelization, as he considered it a legitimate part of the film's world rather than just an advertisement. He originally asked Alan Garner to write it, but Garner declined on account of prior engagements. Henson and Smith met several times over meals to discuss the progress of the manuscript. According to Smith, their only major disagreement had arisen over his dislike of the Podlings, which he considered \"boring\". He included a scene in which a Garthim carrying a sackful of Podlings fell down a cliff and crushed them. Henson considered this scene to be an element of \"gratuitous cruelty\" that did not fit well into the scope of the story. In order to assist Smith in his visualizing the world of The Dark Crystal, Henson invited him to visit Elstree Studios during filming.

Since they had a tight budget, McKean designed creatures who were comparatively simple. He assigned entire sequences rather than tiny pieces to individual artists, so that the young professionals working on the film would have the creative opportunity to make part of it their own.
