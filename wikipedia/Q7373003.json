City had defeated Blackburn Rovers 3-1 in the third round of that years FA Cup with the 'penetrative raiding and deadly shooting' of Brook (who scored once) and Toseland (who scored twice) key to victory. City defeated Hull City, Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City in subsequent rounds to reach the final. Brook scored a 'wonder goal' in front of a record crowd of 84,569 against Stoke City in the sixth round of that year's competition. According to Gary James, 'many fans from the 1930s claimed it was the greatest City goal ever scored at Maine Road'. Brook had made 'a speculative lob' from the wing, which seemed to change direction in mid-flight, which curled past Stoke goalkeeper Roy John. Some claimed that Brook's lob was a cross, but those who knew Brook said it was the type of unconventional thing he would try. The FA Cup winning City team included goalkeeper Frank Swift and left half Jackie Bray, who would both emulate Brook by going on to appear for England. Swift fainted from nervous exhaustion just before the City team were about to ascend the steps at Wembley to collect the trophy and their winners medals. Swift elicited no sympathy from Brook who reportedly ordered him to 'Get up! There's a hundred thousand people here, we've just won the cup and you're making us look fools'. Arsenal defeated City to win the 1934 FA Charity Shield."]}, {"page": "John (surname)", "response": ["* Roy John (footballer) (1911\u20131973), Wales international footballer", "* Roy John (rugby union) (1925\u20131981), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Dwr-y-Felin Comprehensive School", "response": ["* Roy John, Wales international rugby player"]}, {"page": "Dave Beswick", "response": ["Beswick was born in Stoke-on-Trent and played for Mount Pleasant before joining Stoke City in 1929.
