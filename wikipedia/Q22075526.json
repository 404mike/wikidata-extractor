When Scott began preparing the film, Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film. When Scott and producer Mark Huffam had their first production meeting, they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich. NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration. Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division, and Dave Lavery, the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration. Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started. Over a period of a month, NASA answered hundreds of questions\u2014on a weekly basis\u2014on everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential \"habs\"\u2014the residences for future Mars astronauts. The questions were answered by Green or passed on to the right expert, and then came back to Scott's team to make their way into the production. The space agency also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers, down to what the computer screens look like, to the production team. Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max, who met with individual specialists, taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours. The production designer created a futuristic, heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set; Ars Technica described its depiction as \"the space agency that we all dream of\" and the opposite of the real Johnson Center's appearance as \"a run down college campus\"."]}, {"page": "88th Academy Awards", "response": ["** The Martian\u00a0\u2013 Simon Kinberg, Ridley Scott, Michael Schaefer and Mark Huffam"]}, {"page": "27th Producers Guild of America Awards", "response": ["** The Martian \u2013 Simon Kinberg, Ridley Scott, Michael Schaefer, and Mark Huffam"]}, {"page": "List of accolades received by The Martian (film)", "response": ["| Simon Kinberg, Ridley Scott, Michael Schaefer and Mark Huffam", "| Simon Kinberg, Ridley Scott, Michael Schaefer, Mark Huffam"]}, {"page": "List of Jewish Academy Award winners and nominees", "response": ["| Shared with Ridley Scott, Michael Schaefer, and Mark Huffam"]}, {"page": "Johnny English (franchise)", "response": ["| Tim BevanEric FellnerMark Huffam"]}, {"page": "Huffam, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Huffam"]}]}}
