The association of chorea with rheumatism was first reported in 1802, and confirmed in the following decades by several French and English authors. The inclusion of chorea under the rheumatic umbrella helped discriminate Sydenham's chorea from other \"choreic\" syndromes. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease is not declining. Recent figures quote the incidence of Acute Rheumatic Fever as 0.6\u20130.7/1,000 population in the United States and Japan compared with 15\u201321/1,000 population in Asia and Africa. The prevalence of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Sydenham's Chorea has declined progressively in developed countries over the last decades. Physicians working in early children's hospitals recognised new clinical syndromes through the definition of \"typical clinical cases\". Complex multi-systemic diseases, such as rheumatic fever, were categorised only after the observation of large, hospital based series. Therefore, paediatric hospitals gradually became an important setting for the application of a modern \"statistical averaging\" technique to paediatric syndromes. Historical authorities in paediatrics, such as Walter Butler Cheadle and Octavius Sturges, worked at London's Hospital for Sick Children, and their clinical notes help elucidate how the typical case of Sydenham's chorea was defined."]}, {"page": "Octavius", "response": ["* Octavius Sturges (1833\u20131895), English physician"]}]}}
