After surgery on a troublesome ankle injury, Cork joined the county in their pre-season tour of South Africa before making his debut for the county in a County Championship match against Northamptonshire. Cork's early days at his new county brought mixed fortunes, suffering a loss of form in 2004, coupled with relegation from Division One of the County Championship. Cork's maiden season with Lancashire did see him play a role in taking them to finals day in the Twenty20 Cup at Edgbaston, where he played in their semi-final defeat by Surrey. He was awarded his county cap in 2004.  The county were promoted back to Division One the following season, a season in which Cork took 46 first-class wickets at 26, and 17 List A wickets at an average 27.47. This season was a marked improvement on Cork's debut season for Lancashire.  In 2006, Lancashire mounted a challenge for the County Championship, with Cork taking 42 wickets at an average of 25.50. Lancashire were eventually beaten to the title by Sussex.  Cork also played a key role in Lancashire's run to the final of the 2006 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, where they played Sussex.  Opening the bowling with Kyle Hogg, Cork did not take any Sussex wickets, but did run-out Richard Montgomerie and Carl Hopkinson.
