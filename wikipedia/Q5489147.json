Formby's screen and stage persona of innocence and simplicity was not seen as ignorance or stupidity, although Basil Dean disagreed and thought that Formby \"didn't act gormless as many successful Lancashire comedians have done, he was gormless\". Much of the innocence in Formby's performance is connected to sex, and the use of double entendres within his songs. John Caughie and Kevin Rockett, in their examination of British film, and Richards, see a connection between Formby's approach to sex and the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill. Richards sees the function of Formby's humour as being the same as McGill's: \"the harmless diffusion of a major source of tension in a deeply repressed and conventional society\". Formby's delivery of the sexual content\u2014what McFarlane identifies as being \"sung with such a toothy grin and air of innocence\"\u2014negated any possible indignation, and this contrasts with the more overtly sexual delivery of other performers of the time, such as Max Miller and Frank Randle."]}, {"page": "Will Hay", "response": ["The humour of Hay's films has been described as subversive and similar to that of fellow English comedian Frank Randle. His films are often characterised as exhibiting traits of anti-authoritarianism and having a satirical approach towards how authority figures are portrayed.

The studio was sold to the BBC in 1954, the same year that saw the advent of commercial television in the UK.

It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife.
