Collins (born 4 March 1970) is a researcher in the field of computational linguistics.\nHis research interests are in natural language processing as well as machine learning and he has made important contributions in statistical parsing and in statistical machine learning. In his studies Collins covers a wide range of topics such as parse re-ranking, tree kernels, semi-supervised learning, machine translation and exponentiated gradient algorithms with a general focus on discriminative models and structured prediction. One notable contribution is a state-of-the-art parser for the Penn Wall Street Journal corpus. As of 11 November 2015, his works have been cited 16,020 times, and he has an h-index of 47.Collins worked as a researcher at AT&T Labs between January 1999 and November 2002, and later held the positions of assistant and associate professor at M.I.T. Since January 2011, he has been a professor at Columbia University. In 2011, he was named a fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Collins (surname)", "response": ["*Michael Collins (disambiguation), multiple people, one of several people including:", "**Michael Collins (bishop) (1771\u20131832), Roman Catholic Bishop of Cloyne and Ross", "**Michael Collins (Irish leader) (1890\u20131922), Irish Republican leader", "**Michael Collins (American author), pseudonym of American author Dennis Lynds (1924\u20132005)", "**Michael Collins (astronaut) (1930\u20132021), American astronaut, a member of the historic Apollo 11 crew", "**Michael Collins (Limerick politician) (born 1940), contemporary Irish politician", "**Michael Collins (hurler) (1941\u20132009), Irish hurler", "**D.

This is an adaptation of CKY (previously mentioned for constituency parsing) to headed dependencies, a benefit being that the only change from constituency parsing is that every constituent is headed by one of its descendant nodes. Thus, one can simply specify which child provides the head for every constituency rule in the grammar (e.g. an NP is headed by its child N) to go from constituency CKY parsing to dependency CKY parsing."]}]}}
