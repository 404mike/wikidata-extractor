Henry McGee and Bob Todd joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players, and the later shows also featured \"Hill's Little Angels\", a group of cute children including the families of Dennis Kirkland (the show's director) and Sue Upton.

He once failed to turn up for a London Palladium show after a 'drinking episode', and found himself in a Dublin hospital five days later. After this was reported in the media, Hill had Todd dropped from the show. Producer Dennis Kirkland persuaded Hill to rescind the decision, saying Todd brought much to the show and his drinking rarely affected his work.  Todd was also a very heavy cannabis smoker, and was frequently under the influence of the drug during tapings of the Q and Benny Hill shows."]}, {"page": "2006 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 February \u2013 Dennis Kirkland, television producer (born 1942)"]}, {"page": "1942 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 December \u2013 Dennis Kirkland, English television producer (died 2006)"]}, {"page": "Sue Upton", "response": ["For roughly the first half of her time on The Benny Hill Show, she both danced as a member of the Hill's Angels troupe and acted in comedy sketches. As her tenure with the show lengthened, she moved away from dancing in favour of comic acting only. One of Upton's comic character portrayals was the geriatric superheroine \"Wondergran\". In a later episode, she played Stan Laurel to Benny's Oliver Hardy. Behind the scenes, she became the Angels' unofficial \"shop steward\" in the show's later years, interceding on their behalf with Hill or with producer Dennis Kirkland when necessary. She also had a hand in the selection of prospective Angels, recommending girls who she thought might be suitable to Hill for auditions.Kirkland, p. 129."]}, {"page": "Kirkland (surname)", "response": ["*Dennis Kirkland, British producer and director"]}]}}
