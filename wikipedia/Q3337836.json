Promotion was achieved via the play-offs after the club beat Fulham and Northampton Town. The Mariners also saw success in the Football League Trophy in which they defeated AFC Bournemouth at Wembley Stadium. Bournemouth led in the game before Black made the tie all square to send the game into extra time. Wayne Burnett scored the golden goal to send Grimsby home with the trophy. Black went on to feature for Grimsby in the first division for the next three seasons. When manager Alan Buckley was sacked in September 2000, he was replaced by Lennie Lawrence who in turn brought in midfielders Menno Willems, Knut Anders Fostervold, Neil Murray and most notably Leicester City youngster Stuart Campbell. With this Black found it hard to get a look in with the club, but avoided the chop unlike unfavoured utility man Adam Buckley. Black was instead put up for loan, and joined Lincoln City. The Imps would later appoint former Grimsby boss Alan Buckley as their new manager. Black returned to Blundell Park towards the end of the season and was deemed surplus to requirements by Lawrence.
