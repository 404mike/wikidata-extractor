He came to prominence in the Championship with Reading after a January 2003 move to the Royals and spent 4+1\u20442 years with the club, helping them to earn promotion to the Premier League for the first time ever in 2005\u201306. He joined Chelsea on a free transfer for the 2007\u201308 season, however opportunities were limited at Stamford Bridge and he moved on to Aston Villa in July 2008 for a fee of \u00a35 million. In his 2+1\u20442-year stay at Villa Park he played 64 times, scoring four goals. Sidwell then spent 3+1\u20442 years at Fulham, making 115 appearances scoring 17 goals. His time at Craven Cottage ended after the club was relegated from the Premier League in 2013\u201314, and he subsequently joined Stoke City in June 2014 on a free transfer. He made only 13 appearances for the club, and finished his career with a two year spell at Brighton & Hove Albion, initially on loan, retiring in 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Beckham", "response": ["On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer. With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN. As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race."]}, {"page": "December 14", "response": ["*  1982   \u2013 Steve Sidwell, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Michael Ballack", "response": ["Despite persistent rumours in the summer 2007 transfer window, Ballack denied that he wanted to leave and no such move materialised. Chelsea left Ballack out of their Champions League squad for the 2007\u201308 group stage as they realised that his injury would prevent him from playing any useful part and preferred to select the fully fit Steve Sidwell. The German international had an ankle operation in the summer and Chelsea could not take the risk of him not regaining full fitness before the end of the group stage. Thus, Ballack could not play in the Champions League before the knockout stages began in February. The club was only able to select 23 out of a possible 25 players for their Champions League squad due to the new UEFA regulations on \"association-trained players\" and \"club-trained players\". Due to this regulation, Chelsea were also unable to select young player Scott Sinclair and could only pick 23 players as their only \"club-trained player\" was John Terry. For this reason, it was deemed unwise to gamble on Ballack being fit at some point."]}, {"page": "Mark Hughes", "response": ["For the 2014\u201315 season, Hughes signed Sunderland full-back Phil Bardsley, Fulham midfielder Steve Sidwell and Senegalese striker Mame Biram Diouf on free transfers. Also arriving for small fees were Slovakian defender Dionatan Teixeira and Barcelona forward Bojan, while wingers Victor Moses and Oussama Assaidi joined on season-long loans. Departing were Matthew Etherington, Michael Kightly, Cameron Jerome and Ryan Shotton. Stoke had a mixed start to the 2014\u201315 season, losing 1\u20130 to Aston Villa on the opening day, drawing 1\u20131 with ten-men Hull City, yet defeating reigning Premier League champions Manchester City 1\u20130. Stoke's inconsistency continued through the autumn as Stoke managed just three wins beating Newcastle, Swansea and Tottenham. The club then suffered frustrating home defeats against newly promoted Burnley and Leicester City. Stoke found form in December beating Arsenal 3\u20132, Everton 1\u20130 and West Brom 2\u20130.", "Stoke started 2016 poorly, falling to West Brom and then Liverpool in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final. The club endured a tough final week of January as they lost 3\u20130 to both Leicester and Manchester United and were knocked out of the League Cup by Liverpool after losing on penalties, and were also ousted from the FA Cup by Crystal Palace. In the January transfer window, Hughes let Steve Sidwell leave as well as cutting short Marco van Ginkel's loan, while he broke the club's transfer record he had set in the summer after signing French midfielder Giannelli Imbula from Porto for a fee of \u00a318.3\u00a0million. Stoke's form improved in February and March as they defeated Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Watford and earned a first Premier League draw at Chelsea. Following a season-ending injury to goalkeeper Jack Butland while on international duty, however, Stoke lost their defensive organisation: They let a 2\u20130 lead slip against Swansea to draw 2\u20132 and then went and conceded four goals in three successive matches, against Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City. Hughes' team were able to end the season on a positive as they beat West Ham 2\u20131 on the final day of the season, enough to secure a third-straight ninth-place finish."]}, {"page": "Chris Baird", "response": ["With Kelly falling out of favour in the early part of the 2012\u201313 season, and injuries to players like Mahamadou Diarra, plus the departures of Danny Murphy, Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Dickson Etuhu, Baird has become a regular in central midfield again, alongside Steve Sidwell, and with just those two goals at Stoke to his name for Fulham in 113 games prior to 20 October 2012, he scored in consecutive weeks at the end of October, the first being the winner in the 1\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa and then scoring a header in a 3\u20133 draw with Reading on 27 October 2012.

He quickly added his 3rd of the season in the 2\u20131 defeat of local rivals West Bromwich Albion; and with Gabriel Agbonlahor on the scoresheet again the pair began to form a formidable partnership. They both scored again and assisted each other's goals in a 4\u20130 victory in the Premier League at Wigan Athletic on 26 October 2008. Carew scored the winning goal in the UEFA Cup for Villa in a Group F match away to Slavia Prague on 6 November 2008, Villa midfielder Steve Sidwell struck the ball towards goal but it hit Carew and went in, therefore the goal was credited to Carew; it turned out to be the winning goal and continued Villa's 100% record in the competition's group stages and the 1\u20130 victory saw Villa go to the top of the group. Carew made the headlines in late October due to his personal behaviour.
