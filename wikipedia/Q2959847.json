It was not until the year 1882 where Moore\u2019s assistant Ernst Betche had collected adequate specimens of the leaves and fruit of the Heteromera which upon receiving was named by Moore.

Furthermore, its pinnae forked twice and were bright red at the base. However, after a small revision in 1998 by David L Jones, the glauca and tenuifolia variants became recognised as their own species under the M. heteromera complex.
