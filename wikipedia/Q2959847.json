He arrived in Sydney on 14 January 1848 and took up the position of Director of the Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney, a position he held until 5 May 1896. In this time he undertook several trips in eastern New South Wales as a plant and seed collector. \nMoore trained in the Botanic Gardens of Trinity College, Dublin. As Director for 48 years (1848\u201396), he did much to develop Sydney's Botanic Garden in its modern form. He tackled the problems of poor soil, inadequate water and shortage of funds to develop much of the Gardens in the form we see today. The Palm Grove, in the heart of the Garden, is a reminder of his skill and foresight, as is the reclaimed land behind the Farm Cove seawall which added a significant area to the Royal Botanic Gardens. \nNineteen species were named after him by Ferdinand von Mueller", "link_mentions": {}}}
