On the bank is some of the encroaching housing, while in the background above are the cliffs of a lime quarry and smoke rising from the kiln. Though Philip James de Loutherbourg's 1805 painting of the ruins does not include the intrusive buildings commented on by others, it makes their inhabitants and animals a prominent feature. Even William Havell's panorama of the valley from the south pictures smoke rising in the distance (see Gallery), much as Wordsworth had noted five years before \"wreathes of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees\" in his description of the scene.\"Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey\", lines 18\u201319"]}, {"page": "Thomas Girtin", "response": ["Thomas Girtin was born in Southwark, London, the son of a wealthy brushmaker of Huguenot descent. His father died while Thomas was a child, and his mother then married a Mr Vaughan, a pattern-draughtsman. Girtin learnt drawing as a boy (attending classes with Thomas Malton), and was apprenticed to Edward Dayes (1763\u20131804), a topographical watercolourist. He is believed to have served out his seven-year term, although there are unconfirmed reports of clashes between master and apprentice, and even that Dayes had Girtin imprisoned as a refractory apprentice. Certainly Dayes did not appreciate his pupil's talent, and he was to write dismissively of Girtin after his death."]}, {"page": "Thomas Kirk (artist)", "response": ["Although he illustrated James Thomson's The Seasons in 1793, he was employed most consistently by Cooke for his editions of celebrated works of literature. Cooke's Pocket Edition of English Poets (1796-8) was especially popular, and Kirk's illustrations impressed many of his contemporaries.

Andrew Plimer (1763\u20131837) was a pupil of Cosway, and both he and his brother Nathaniel Plimer produced some lovely portraits. The brightness of the eyes, wiriness of the hair, exuberance of colour, combined with forced chiaroscuro and often very inaccurate drawing, are characteristics of Andrew Plimer's work. John Smart (c. 1740 1811) was in some respects the greatest of the 18th-century miniaturists. His work was hailed by contemporaries for his excellence in refinement, power and delicacy; its silky texture and elaborate finish, and the artists love for a brown background. Other notable painters were Richard Crosse (1742\u20131810), Ozias Humphry (1742\u20131810), Samuel Shelley (c1750\u20131808), whose best pictures are groups of two or more persons, Henry Edridge (1769\u20131821), John Bogle, and Edward Dayes."]}, {"page": "Furness Abbey", "response": ["File:Edward_Dayes_-_Furness_Abbey,_Lancashire.jpg|Painting of the abbey by Edward Dayes"]}, {"page": "Madeley Wood Company", "response": ["The name Bedlam Furnaces may have originated with a painting by John Sell Cotman (1782\u20131842) who painted the furnace in 1803 and titled it Bedlam Furnace Near Irongate, Shropshire. He was on tour with a fellow less well known artist called Paul Sandby Munn (1773\u20131845) who also painted the same subject and titled it Bedlam Furnace, Madeley Dale, Shropshire. It was both a metaphor (the place appeared to the painters to resemble a lunatic asylum), and simultaneously a jest at the expense of Fletcher of Madeley (1729\u20131785) a then famous Methodist preacher in whose parish the ironworks were located. The furnaces were also painted, under the same name, by the painter Edward Dayes (d. 1804) at around the same time.
