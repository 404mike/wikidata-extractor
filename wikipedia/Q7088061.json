For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the Moravian scientist and Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel, and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of heredity. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of genetic drift, for example."]}, {"page": "Fossil", "response": ["* \"It's extremely hard to become a fossil\", by Olivia Judson, 30 Dec 2008, The New York Times", "* \"Bones Are Not the Only Fossils\", by Olivia Judson, 4 Mar 2008, The New York Times"]}, {"page": "Extinction", "response": ["Biologist Olivia Judson has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying mosquito species.

She says that the Anopheles mosquitoes (which spread malaria) and Aedes mosquitoes (which spread dengue fever, yellow fever, elephantiasis, and other diseases) represent only 30 of around 3,500 mosquito species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the genetic diversity of the family Culicidae by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct \"all the time\" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem: \"We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species\u2014but different need not mean worse.\" In addition, anti-malarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope to the 300\u00a0million people in developing nations who will be infected with acute illnesses this year.
