He became only the second British man to achieve a World Cup alpine podium, after Konrad Bartelski, who finished second in the Val Gardena downhill in 1981, and only the fourth Briton to take a World Cup podium (after Bartelski, Gina Hathorn and Divina Galica, who took top three finishes on the women's circuit in 1967 and 1968 respectively). In an interview later that year, Ryding said that as he had never completed two runs at Kitzb\u00fchel, he had engaged in extensive video analysis of Fritz Dopfer's fastest first run in the previous year's Hahnenkamm slalom ahead of the race, watching it \"70 times at least\" to observe how Dopfer adapted to the piste's terrain changes. He went on to finish 11th in the slalom at the 2017 World Championships in St. Moritz, the best result for a British skier at a World Championships since 2005.
