Writing for Billboard, Chuck Taylor praised the natural melody, radiant hook, and infectious energy of the song, which he compared to Adams' 1985 song \"Summer of '69\", but critiqued that Melanie C's \"rousing background vocals\" is a gimmick to give the song exposure in the United Kingdom. However, Sam Taylor of The Observer considered the song to be \"jarring\" and described Melanie C's vocals as \"wailing atonally\". Writing about the rendition performed by Adams and Anderson, Keith Caulfield of Billboard criticized the latter's \"featherweight background vocals\", which were buried in the song and considered \"novelty\" for radio stations."]}, {"page": "Tomas Ryal", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Taylor (author)"]}, {"page": "HHhH", "response": ["HHhH has been translated into more than twenty languages.
