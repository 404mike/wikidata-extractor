These fields indicate that the land had been used for farming. By 1904, Ordnance Survey maps showed the eastern end of the present campus (approximately where the Medical Centre and Sir Ian Wood building now stand) was mined as a gravel pit.Site Record For Gravel Pit, Garthdee, Aberdeen: http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/207822/details/garthdee+gravel+pit/ This was abandoned just a few decades later and the area was landscaped to create a caravan park. This included covering over the abandoned gravel pit and installing areas of hard standing, in addition to retaining areas of grass as well as part of the lines of beech trees that had not been felled for the gravel pit. Satellite imagery of the site from 2001 shows the caravan park's areas of hard-standing and connecting roads, prior to construction of the Medical Centre (which opened in 2004), with the Faculty of Health and Social Care building mid-way through construction.

It would have left the main road at the site of the caravan park, then crossed a field, and then traversed the \"Garthdee Road allotments\" which the report describes as \"worked at present\" - from there, the route would cut through the land of the Scott Sutherland School of Architecture which by then stood on the Victorian estate.Grampian Regional Council - Department of Road (1992). \"Western Peripheral Route: Report on Options\".
