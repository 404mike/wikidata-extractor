They went on to record four singles, including a cover of the 1963 Chubby Checker US hit \"Twenty Miles\", which was a big seller locally but failed to chart nationally. The Columbia releases, although uncredited, were all produced by Bob Barratt, EMI staff producer, with Norrie Paramor as executive. Paramor played the celesta on \"What's The Matter With Me\"; the b-side of \"Twenty Miles\". In 1965, they played a long stint in Germany at the Storyville in Cologne and also in Duisburg. By this time The Gaylords had attained status as one of the top groups in Scotland, borne out in music poll results, but were ambitious, and so on their return from Germany to London in early 1965, they decided to try for success in the UK as a whole, and remained in London, where they changed management and agency representation, as Billy Grainger wished to remain in Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Trisha Noble", "response": ["* \"I Was Only Foolin' Myself\" (Bob Barratt).

Peter Cushing was supposed to have appeared in the film, but bowed out to care for his sick wife. Cushing was replaced by Ralph Bates, who described Lust for a Vampire as \"one of the worst films ever made\".

The group recorded a five-track acetate with Joe Meek before Tomlinson left in mid-1964 to join The Del Mar Trio with singer Jimmy Marsh (born James Marsh, 9 April 1941, Salem, Carmarthenshire, Wales), guitarist Allen Bevan and bass player Tony Rowland. In February 1965, the group recorded four tracks for EMI at Abbey Road under the supervision of Bob Barratt.
