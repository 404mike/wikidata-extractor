F. Torrance, was a Scottish Protestant theologian and minister. Torrance served for 27 years as professor of Christian dogmatics at New College, in the University of Edinburgh. He is best known for his pioneering work in the study of science and theology, but he is equally respected for his work in systematic theology. While he wrote many books and articles advancing his own study of theology, he also edited the translation of several hundred theological writings into English from other languages, including the English translation of the thirteen-volume, six-million-word Church Dogmatics of Swiss theologian Karl Barth, as well as John Calvin's New Testament Commentaries. He was a member of the famed Torrance family of theologians.\nTorrance has been acknowledged as one of the most significant English-speaking theologians of the 20th century. In 1978, he received the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion. Torrance remained a dedicated churchman throughout his life, serving as an ordained minister in the Church of Scotland. He was instrumental in the development of the historic agreement between the Reformed and Eastern Orthodox churches on the doctrine of the Trinity when a joint statement of agreement on that doctrine was issued between the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and the Orthodox Church on 13 March 1991. He retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1979, but continued to lecture and to publish extensively. Several influential books on the Trinity were published after his retirement; The Trinitarian Faith: The Evangelical Theology of the Ancient Catholic Church (1988), Trinitarian Perspectives: Toward Doctrinal Agreement (1994) and The Christian Doctrine of God, One Being Three Persons (1996).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Thomas F.

Before the outbreak of the war Brunner returned to Europe with the young Scottish theologian Thomas F.

Following the war, Brunner delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, in 1946\u20131947 on Christianity and Civilisation. In 1953 he retired from his post at the University of Zurich and took up a position of Visiting Professor at the recently founded International Christian University in Tokyo, Japan (1953\u20131955), but not before the publication of the first two volumes of his three-volume magnum opus Dogmatics (volume one: The Christian Doctrine of God [1946], volume two: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption [1950], and volume three: The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and Consummation [1960]).
