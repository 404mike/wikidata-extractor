She is most widely known for her roles as Gloria Todd in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street (1985\u20131988) and as Jackie Corkhill in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside (1991\u20132001).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brookside (TV series)", "response": ["Billy Corkhill's children had remained in the series after his departure. Tracey became romantically involved with Barry Grant, leading to her aborting his baby, and Rod married Diana Spence (Paula Frances) and left the police force after being viciously beaten on his wedding night. The Rogers' divorced after Chrissy (Eithne Browne) walked out on the family to join teacher training college on Sammy and Owen's wedding day. By the end of 1991, Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan), had become a series regular and he played a central part in the show. He was joined by his estranged wife Jackie (Sue Jenkins), who appeared from 1991 working at Dixon's Trading Post, and his elder children Little Jimmy Corkhill (George Christopher) and Lindsey (Claire Sweeney) were initially seen as recurring characters. Jimmy was used to further explore the dark and devastating effects of serious drug addiction, beginning in 1993. The long-running story saw Jimmy descend into uncontrollable drug abuse, climaxing in a cocaine-induced car crash that killed Frank Rogers in November 1993. Teenager Tony Dixon (Mark Lennock) was also involved in the crash and eventually died in February 1994, sparking a feud between Jimmy and Ron that continued until the end of the series. Jimmy had taken part in endless fundraising with Ron's family in an attempt to help Tony recover from what doctors had diagnosed as a persistent vegetative state, but at Tony's funeral he could not hide his guilt any longer and he finally confessed to Ron.", "Like many of the families who came and went in Brookside, the Dixon family also ended in divorce after Ron (Vince Earl) had an affair with Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White), which ended his long marriage to his first wife Deborah \"D.D\" O'Farrell (Irene Marot) who then left the series. During the break up of Ron and DD's marriage, Bev had a one-night stand with Ron's eldest son Mike (Paul Byatt), resulting in the birth of Josh. Ron and Bev lived together for a while, renaming number 8 Cassa-Bevron. This was until Ron almost had an affair with his employee at the Trading Post, Jackie Corkhill (Sue Jenkins), and when Bev eventually found out, she set fire to Cassa-Bevron and fled the Close in 1996. Ron then moved out of number 8 and rented it to Sinbad and his new girlfriend, Carmel O'Leary (Carol Connor), the mother of troublesome teenager Tim 'Tinhead' O'Leary (Philip Olivier). Later in 1999, Ron met and remarried an old flame, Anthea Brindley (Barbara Hatwell), the mother of his long-lost (and quickly forgotten) daughter, Megan, who looked identical to his Ron's other daughter Jacqui. Although initially happy and starting up their own successful business together, Great Grannies, this marriage also ended in divorce when Anthea refused to lie in court after Ron shot dead Clint Moffat (Greg Pateras) whilst being held hostage in the kitchen of number 8. This was alleged to be an act of 'self-defence', but resulted in Ron spending six months in prison. This storyline was based on the real-life case involving Tony Martin who shot an intruder on his property in an alleged act of self-defence.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White.
