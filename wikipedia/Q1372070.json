He also played for the Scotland national team. His usual position was tighthead prop and he was known as a strong scrummager. He is a fundamentalist Christian and throughout his career has decided not to play on Sundays.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle Falcons", "response": ["Towards the end of the previous season Chairman Dave Thompson had to seek investment for the club due to increasing debts following the Nationalisation of Northern Rock, the club's main sponsor. After months of speculation, it was announced that local businessman Semore Kurdi had purchased a 40% stake in the club in September 2010, easing the club's financial difficulties. Scotland number 8 Allister Hogg was signed, while Scotland and Lions prop Euan Murray also arrived to plug the gap left by Hayman.  On the pitch in Alan Tait's first season the Falcons reached the Anglo-Welsh Cup final, losing to Gloucester 34\u20137. Despite this relative success the Falcons finished their worst ever Premiership season with just 23 points (four wins), only escaping relegation thanks to the inferior points difference of Leeds Carnegie. England Saxons pair, scrum-half Micky Young and prop Kieran Brookes, would both depart for Leicester Tigers at the end of the campaign.", "The huge outflow of talent from 2008 onwards, and lack of suitable reinforcements, would come to bear during this campaign.  Samoa international centre Jamie Helleur was a rare quality signing.  The 2011\u201312 season saw Newcastle Falcons relegated from the Premiership. The Falcons started the season badly but rallied midway through as Gary Gold took over. After changing the set up at Kingston Park, the club nearly escaped relegation, but London Wasps held on to secure their Premiership status by a point. Despite finishing with a higher points total than the year before (32) it was not enough to keep them up. The Falcons still had a small hope that London Welsh may be refused Premiership status, however Welsh were promoted after an appeal.  Many players, including Euan Murray, subsequently left the club.", "| Suka Hufanga , Euan Murray , Taiasina Tuifu'a "]}, {"page": "Northampton Saints", "response": ["| Soane Tonga'uiha , Euan Murray, Sean Lamont ", "* Euan Murray (2009)"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Warriors", "response": ["* Euan Murray", "*2006\u201307:  Euan Murray (1)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Glasgow", "response": ["*Euan Murray"]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* Euan Murray, rugby union player for British and Irish Lions"]}, {"page": "Section Paloise", "response": ["* Euan Murray"]}, {"page": "John Hayes (rugby union)", "response": ["On 18 June 2009, Hayes was called up to the British & Irish Lions squad in South Africa as a replacement for the injured Euan Murray.
