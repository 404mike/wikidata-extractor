He became a household name in Britain in the early 1960s for his report The Reshaping of British Railways, commonly referred to as \"The Beeching Report\", which led to far-reaching changes in the railway network, popularly known as \"the Beeching Axe\".\nAs a result of the report, just over 4,000 route miles (6,400 kilometres) were removed from the system on cost and efficiency grounds, leaving Britain with 13,721 miles (22,082 km) of railway lines in 1966. A further 2,000 miles (3,200 km) were lost by the end of the 1960s.", "link_mentions": {}}}
