After acting as adviser to Hill in her campaigns to save Hampstead Heath and other open spaces, he worked with Rawnsley to save land in the English Lake District from industrial development. In 1893 the three campaigners agreed to set up a national body to acquire vulnerable properties and preserve them for the nation. At Hunter's suggestion it was entitled \"the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\", generally known simply as \"the National Trust\". Hunter was the founding chairman of the trust's executive board.\nFrom 1882 until the year of his death Hunter was solicitor to the General Post Office. His negotiations in that capacity were estimated to have saved the British taxpayer many millions of pounds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Haslemere", "response": ["* Robert Hunter (1844\u20131913) \u2013 co-founder of the National Trust, Chairman of the Haslemere Parish Council, lived at Meadfields Hanger"]}, {"page": "Robert Hunter", "response": ["Robert Hunter may refer to:", "*Robert Hunter (painter) (died 1780), Irish portrait painter", "*Robert Hunter (encyclop\u00e6dist) (1823\u20131897), British editor of the Encyclop\u00e6dic Dictionary", "*Robert Hunter (author) (1874\u20131942), American sociologist and progressive author", "*Robert Hunter (lyricist) (1941\u20132019), American lyricist, poet, songwriter, singer", "*Robert Hunter (journalist) (1941\u20132005), Canadian environmentalist and journalist, co-founder of Greenpeace", "*Robert Hunter (governor) (1666\u20131734), Lieutenant Governor of Virginia Colony, Governor of New York, New Jersey, Jamaica", "*Robert Hunter (Australian politician) (1877\u20131960), member of the South Australian House of Assembly", "*Robert Hunter (footballer) (1883\u20131962), English footballer", "*Robert Hunter (golfer) (1886\u20131971), American golfer and Olympic gold medalist", "*Robert Hunter (merchant) (1792\u20131848), British diplomat and trader in southeast Asia", "*Robert Hunter (civil servant) (1844\u20131913), British civil servant, co-founder of the National Trust", "*Robert Hunter, Baron Hunter of Newington (1915\u20131994), British physician and university administrator", "*MY Steve Irwin or Robert Hunter, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ship"]}, {"page": "Hardwicke Rawnsley", "response": ["In 1883 Rawnsley was appointed Vicar of Crosthwaite, Cumberland, in the north of the Lake District.

Concluding that protests and legislation were not enough to protect the environment, he joined Robert Hunter and Octavia Hill in 1893 to found the National Trust to own land on the public's behalf.

Griffiths writes that although by no means solely responsible for the successful outcome of the campaign, Rawnsley \"became a local and national hero almost overnight, and a new awareness of landscape preservation came to the fore\".Griffiths, p. 76", "Of the three people who later founded the National Trust, Rawnsley was the only one who associated himself even loosely with a party political movement. Robert Hunter, as a civil servant, was not permitted to do so and Octavia Hill was wary of governments and parties in general.Cowell, pp. 299 and 303 There were two main British parties at the time: the Conservatives, seen as defending the interests of the landed aristocracy,Harbour, pp. 137\u2013138 and the Liberals, generally more sympathetic to ideas about environmental protection and public access to the countryside.Cowell, pp. 302 and 309 When English local government was reorganised in the late 1880s Rawnsley stood as an independent Liberal for the newly-formed Cumberland County Council in January 1889.
