His writing is characterised by black comedy and fantastic ideas, such as the complete disappearance of a man\u2019s house, family and dog (One of Our Commuters is Missing) and the need for all mankind to jump in the air simultaneously (Jump! - a work which was produced on radio, stage, TV and as a book.)\nHis first radio play in 1974 was Haywire at Humbleford Flag and there swiftly followed a stream of high-quality radio plays, ending with The Final Twist (from a stage play written in collaboration with Alfred Bradley.)\nWhitmore\u2019s adaptations for radio are Going Under from the novel by the Russian Lydia Chukovskaya, a five-part adaptation of Brighton Rock by Graham Greene, and an eight-part adaptation of Fame is the Spur by Howard Spring.\nHis published stage plays are Jump for Your Life, Pen Friends, La Bolshie Vita, The Final Twist and The Turn of the Screw, adapted from the story by Henry James.\nPaul Donovan on TimesOnline quoted Whitmore as saying that his dearest wish was to write a drama that would stop people ironing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 22", "response": ["*  1937   \u2013 Ken Whitmore, English author and playwright"]}, {"page": "8th Annual Grammy Awards", "response": ["**Robert M.
