McGinnity also has an MBE.\nMcGinnity purchased a company called Pel in the summer of 1989, creating a new division specialising in plastic seating for football stadia. In January 1990 the Taylor report into the Hillborough disaster recommended all-seater stadia. The success of Pel Stadium Seating was subsequently attributed to having set up in time to benefit from the Taylor report.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Robinson", "response": ["Robinson has had a long association with Coventry City F.C., being a member of the board of directors from 1996. In 1997, when Robinson was made Paymaster General, he was forced to stand down from the board because members of the government were not permitted to hold directorships. Brenda Price, a former colleague from his Triumph Motorcycle board days at Meriden sat on the Coventry City board with him. In response to this the football club named him as honorary President but he eventually re-took his seat on the board of directors in 2002. On 21 September 2005, Robinson was named as acting Chairman of Coventry City after chairman Mike McGinnity was asked to step down by his doctor for an indefinite period due to ongoing health problems. Robinson was appointed chairman permanently on 3 November after McGinnity was forced to resign due to his health problems. On 10 October 2007 he announced that he would step down as chairman because \"there are not enough hours in the day\".
