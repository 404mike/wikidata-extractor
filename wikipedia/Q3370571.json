"]}, {"page": "Reverse-contrast typefaces", "response": ["The Caslon Italian typeface is very clearly \"conceptual\" in design, deliberately taking aspects of the fat face and one by one inverting them; Nick Sherman comments that it \"shows a very literal approach to reversing stroke weight, so thicks become thin and thins become thick.\" It has very thick serifs, so the gap between the serifs and the main strokes making up the letters is very small, as can be seen on letters such as 'E' and 'S'. To make the effect even more shocking, the triangular serifs were inverted (becoming thinner as they met the letter, not thicker), and the thicker line on the 'A' was moved from its normal position on the right (the natural position matching the handwriting of a right-handed writer) to the left, making a letter that seems to have been drawn the wrong way round. Writing for Print magazine, Paul Shaw described it as \"one of the most bizarre slab serif types of the 19th century.\" Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz describe it as \"perverse [but] done with sureness and confidence.\"", "Several digitisations of the Italian style have been made. Peter Bi\u013eak's Karloff is a family of normal and matching reverse-contrast fonts with upper- and lower-case, together with a low-contrast slab serif design, all with the same basic structure. Bi\u013eak and his colleagues tried to strictly invert the contrast of a conventional Didone font and interpolate the two for the low-contrast slab serif. These have been released as Karloff Positive, Negative and Neutral, the name referring to Boris Karloff. A caps-only revival with extremely high contrast is Kris Sowersby's Maelstrom, which also has a sans-serif companion design. Paul Barnes of Commercial Type has released an Italian revival, along with extensive information on the research made for the project and a companion French Antique design (see below). Village Type's Arbor also a lower-case, while Match & Kerosene's Slab Sheriff is caps-only, with a 'A' featuring the conventional stress on the right.
