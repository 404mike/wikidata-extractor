It is likely that her brother Howard, a proprietor of the Register, was behind these editorials."]}, {"page": "List of members of the London School Board", "response": ["| Rosamond Davenport Hill", "| Rosamond Davenport Hill", "| Rosamond Davenport Hill ", "| Rosamond Davenport Hill", "| Rosamond Davenport Hill", "| Rosamond Davenport Hill"]}]}}
