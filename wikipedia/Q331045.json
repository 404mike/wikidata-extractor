He dropped just seven legs in the six matches he played which concluded with a 6\u20131 victory over Jamie Lewis in the final. However, Taylor's win in Gibraltar was later the subject of controversy as footage emerged showing him winning a leg and retrieving his dart when he had actually missed the double. Neither referee Russ Bray nor his opponent Dean Winstanley noticed the error and Taylor went on to win the match 6\u20131. Taylor insisted that he had not realised that the dart had missed and offered to replay the match and forfeit his prize money. The PDC released a statement blaming the incident on human error. The incident led to a feud with Taylor's old mentor Eric Bristow who stated: \"The player knows if it's not in the bed and has to declare it. You don't want cheats in the game\". Taylor responded by claiming that Bristow's comments were \"hurtful\" and that he would not be talking to Bristow again."]}, {"page": "Nine-dart finish", "response": ["|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray", "|Russ Bray"]}, {"page": "The Voice", "response": ["* Russ Bray (born 1957), a darts referee"]}, {"page": "Bray (surname)", "response": ["*Russ Bray (born 1957), English darts announcer"]}, {"page": "PDC World Championship Darts Pro Tour", "response": ["The atmosphere has been further enhanced with an all-new commentary from Sid Waddell and John Gwynne, top level match referees, Bruce Spendley and Russ Bray and Master of Ceremonies, John McDonald."]}, {"page": "One Hundred and Eighty", "response": ["One Hundred and Eighty is a British darts game show that aired on Sky 1 from 15 September to 22 October 2015 and was hosted by Davina McCall.
