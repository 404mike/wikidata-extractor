She was one of the first women to achieve academic success in this sphere, and is best known for her history of England under the Angevin kings and for coining the name Angevin Empire to describe their domains. She was self-educated in the Victorian era when higher education was generally denied to women. Her obituary in The Times described her as \"the most learned woman historian of the pre-academic period.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John, King of England", "response": ["By the Victorian period in the 19th century, historians were more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John's moral personality. Kate Norgate, for example, argued that John's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his \"almost superhuman wickedness\", whilst James Ramsay blamed John's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall.Norgate (1902), p. 286; Ramsay, p. 502. Historians in the \"Whiggish\" tradition, focusing on documents such as the Domesday Book and , trace a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period.Dyer, p. 4; Coss, p. 81. These historians were often inclined to see John's reign, and his signing of  in particular, as a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the King himself. Winston Churchill, for example, argued that \"[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns\".Churchill, p. 190."]}, {"page": "Pope Adrian IV", "response": ["King Henry claimed to be motivated by a wish to civilise the supposedly unruly Irish. The Victorian historian Kate Norgate, however, has noted that the spiritual community in 12th-century Ireland \"flourished\", and that the Pope must have known this, as it was only a few years earlier that the Irish church had been reorganised into Archdioceses, thus making it a national church in its own right. Norgate argues that Adrian's grant was made, not because the church in Ireland needed protecting, but because the Irish lacked a single king and for Christian society to have no single head was an anathema. She also notes that it has misleadingly be called a Bull, when it is, in fact, sufficiently informal in its style to be \"nothing more than a commendatory letter\". Simple in its approach, the Pope exhorts Henry\u2014if he is to invade Ireland\u2014to do so in the name of the church. Other scholars have argued that, whether or not it was an out and out forgery by Gerald of Wales, Adrian was more likely to have been lukewarm at the idea of invasion at best, as he was equally unenthusiastic at the notion of a Franco-English crusade to the East at the same time."]}, {"page": "Anjou", "response": ["* Kate Norgate, England under the Angevin Kings (2 vols., London, 1887)"]}, {"page": "Henry III of England", "response": ["By the 19th century, Victorian scholars such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt sought to understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.; "]}, {"page": "Empress Matilda", "response": ["Tudor scholars were interested in Matilda's right of succession. According to 16th century standards, Matilda had a clear right to the English throne, and academics therefore struggled to explain why Matilda had acquiesced to her son Henry's kingship at the end of the war, rather than ruling directly herself. By the 18th century, historians such as David Hume had a much better understanding of the irregular nature of 12th century law and custom and this question became less relevant. By the 19th century, the archival sources on Matilda's life, including charters, foundation histories, and letters, were being uncovered and analysed. Historians Kate Norgate, Sir James Ramsay and J. H. Round used these to produce new, richer accounts of Matilda and the civil war; Ramsay's account, using the Gesta Stephani, was not complimentary, while Norgate, drawing on French sources, was more neutral in tone. The German academic Oskar R\u00f6ssler's 1897 biography drew heavily on German charters, not extensively used by Anglophone historians."]}, {"page": "Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair", "response": ["*Kate Norgate, England under the Angevin Kings, vol. ii.

His father tried to disinherit him in favour of Fulk the Younger, his son by his fourth wife, Bertrada of Montfort. Fulk, by then an old man, had previously delegated much of his authority to Geoffrey.Bachrach, 125\u201326, relying on documents in the cartulary compiled for the church of Saint-Laud-d'Angers. With the support of his father's adversaries, Geoffrey seems to have achieved recognition from his father and from 1103 styled himself \"count\" (comes in the Latin of the day) and took control of the government.While Ziolkowski et al., 78\u201379, represent Geoffrey as forcing his father to recognise him, Bachrach, 114, citing Kate Norgate, treats Fulk as effectively deposed for three years. He allied with Renaud de Martign\u00e9, Bishop of Angers, against the baron Maurice of Craon. An anonymous poem by a scholar or cleric addressed to a certain Philip, probably Philip of Melun, son of Philip I of France through his dalliance with Bertrada, is an encomium of a \"Count Martel\" (Martellus consul), probably Geoffrey IV.The poem's incipit is \"Omnibus in rebus quas, mi Philippe, uidemus\" (In all things we see, my dear Philip) and it is found only in the late twelfth-century manuscript collection of Latin verse known as the Carmina Houghtoniensia (Poem 90). It is fifty elegiac distichs long. For an edition of the poem with translation, analysis and commentary, see Ziolkowski et al., 77\u201393. The poem is didactic and upholds the count, only named as Martel, as an exemplar of good rulership.

Researchers disagree on the date of this double event: Alison Weir and Mary Anne Everett Green date it 20 July 1235; Kate Norgate, author of the article on Isabella in the Dictionary of National Biography, writes about Sunday 15 July, while James Panton lists both dates as possible. Wedding celebrations lasted for four days, and, as they say, they attended \"four kings, eleven dukes, counts and margraves, thirty or fewer prelates and minor nobles\". On 14 August, Emperor Frederick II called an assembly to which representatives from all over the Empire were invited; they met the new empress and brought her their congratulations. Isabella (or Elizabeth, as some of her husband's subjects called her) seems to have been a very dignified and beautiful woman. Frederick was delighted with his new wife, but immediately after the wedding he got rid of the Isabella's English entourage \"of both sexes\", leaving only her nurse Margaret Biset and one maid with her, and transferred her to seclusion in Hagenau, where the couple spent most of the winter. Earlier, the English embassy, which arrived with Isabella, left for their homeland; they brought gifts to their king from the emperor, among whom were three living leopards \u2014animals depicted on the coat of arms of the English king.", "Isabella died in childbirth at Foggia near Naples in 1241. Alison Weir dated Isabella's death between 1-6 December, while Kate Norgate and Mary Anne Everett Green believe that she died on 1 December. Frederick II at the time of his wife's death was in Faenza, and Isabella's dying words were a request to her husband to continue to maintain friendly relations with her brother King Henry III. Isabella was buried with full honors at Andria Cathedral near Bari beside Frederick's previous wife, Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem.", "*Kate Norgate names three children: Margaret (February 1237 \u2013 1270), Henry (18 February 1238 - 1254) and a child who died in childbirth in December 1241. Later researchers mentioned as the first child of Isabella a son called Jordanus (b. 1236), but Norgate believes that contemporary sources of Isabella do not confirm this; moreover, the Emperor announced the birth of Margaret to his Italian subjects, from which it follows that she was the first child of the couple. Norgate writes that Henry, after the death of his father, became the titular king of Jerusalem, and Margaret was married to Albert II, Margrave of Meissen, and became in one of the ancestors of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha."]}, {"page": "House of Plantagenet", "response": ["The term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined by Kate Norgate in 1887.

The \"Empire\" portion of \"Angevin Empire\" has been controversial, especially as these territories were not subject to any unified laws or systems of governance, and each retained its own laws, traditions, and feudal relationships. In 1986 a convention of historians concluded that there had not been an Angevin state, and therefore no \"Angevin Empire\", but that the term  (French for \"Plantagenet area\") was acceptable.
