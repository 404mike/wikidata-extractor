He'd say \"If you just keep going along the beach you'll get back on track\", Manson later recalled. \"He kept me moving. And I did get back on track. Very shortly after that, I got the call to go and join Garbage\". Manson credited Greig with saving her career, a debt she tacitly acknowledged by quoting the line \"I'm afraid there is much to be afraid of\" from his 1994 long poem Western Swing. Lyrically Manson felt that \"Breaking Up the Girl\" was \"a cautionary tale. It's basically saying the world we're living in is harsh and you've got to live in the moment. Focus on the now. If there's something in your life that isn't good then get rid of them.\" Duke Erikson expanded, \"the light, poppy, melodic feel to the song belies the seriousness of the lyrics\"."]}, {"page": "Kathleen Jamie", "response": ["* A Flame in Your Heart (with Andrew Greig) 1986"]}, {"page": "Eric Gregory Award", "response": ["*1972: Tony Curtis, Richard Berengarten, Brian Oxley, Andrew Greig, Robin Lee, Paul Muldoon"]}, {"page": "Mike Heron", "response": ["In 2017, Heron and a friend, poet and author Andrew Greig, published a memoir entitled You Know What You Could Be: Tuning into the 1960s.
