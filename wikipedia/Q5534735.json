She made her first Coronation Street appearance in 1987, shortly after graduating from drama school. Lancashire had a walk-on role as Wendy Farmer, a nurse who enquired about lodging with established character Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey). The actress then spent a year performing in West End theatre, and worked as a drama lecturer in Salford before being cast as Raquel in 1991, initially on a three-month contract. She continued to teach for a year, before committing to Coronation Street full-time. Thompson believes that it was Raquel's role in the 1994 Tanya and Des love triangle storyline which \"elevated [her] to the pantheon of Street legend.\" Lancashire recalls it as a well-constructed storyline with credible pacing, explaining that \"because Raquel lives in this very idealistic world \u2013 she's such a dreamer \u2013 when reality hits her, it hits very, very hard. That really was the first opportunity we'd had to strip away a bit of the exterior of her character and see how fragile she was.\""]}, {"page": "Lancashire (surname)", "response": ["*Geoffrey Lancashire (1933\u20132004), English scriptwriter"]}]}}
