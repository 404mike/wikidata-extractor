The research was championed by Winston Churchill and soon tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, Gruinard Island in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years. Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed, its program was the first to successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production. Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological weapons programs.", "*Paul Fildes"]}, {"page": "Gruinard Island", "response": ["In 1942, during the Second World War, a biological warfare test was carried out on Gruinard by British military scientists from the Biology Department of Porton Down.Britain's 'Anthrax Island', 25 July 2001 news.bbc.co.uk, accessed 5 March 2020 The British government was investigating the feasibility of a bioweapons attack using anthrax.Living with anthrax island, BBC, 'In 1942 it became the focus of the UK's secret effort to find a weapon capable of defeating the Nazis.', '\"I understand Winston Churchill was very keen on using anthrax,\" says local historian Donald McIntyre. \"He didn't see why the devil should have all the best weapons.\"' 8 November 2001 news.bbc.co.uk, accessed 5 March 2020 It was recognised that tests would cause long-lasting contamination of the immediate area by anthrax spores, so a remote and uninhabited island was required.

According to this theory, based on statements made by Paul Fildes, a Porton Down botulism researcher, the No. 73 anti-tank grenade used in the attack had been modified to contain the toxin. The authors say that only circumstantial evidence supports this allegation; the records of the SOE for the period have remained sealed and few medical records of Heydrich's condition and treatment have been preserved."]}, {"page": "Luke Fildes", "response": ["Fildes' first son, Philip, died of typhoid in 1877.
