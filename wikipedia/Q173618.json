He was also the Technical Director of Red Bull Racing team from 2007 to 2009 and Technical Director of Hispania Racing from 2010 to 2011.\nIn 1987 after a degree at Cambridge University in engineering, he was approached to join the design team of the Peter de Savary's British America's Cup challenge and he spent the next three years designing and developing hull and keel designs for the team in preparation for the competition in San Diego.  Prior to working for Honda, Willis was employed as chief aerodynamicist by the Williams Formula One team and also worked as a consultant at the Leyton House team in the early 1990s. While at Leyton House, Willis met Adrian Newey and it was through this association that he joined Williams, after Newey was recruited by the British team.  When Newey moved to rival McLaren in 1997, Willis was promoted, alongside Gavin Fisher, to take his role.\nWillis joined the British American Racing outfit in 2001, which was later bought by Honda in 2005.  His status within the team became unclear as of 22 June 2006, following the appointment of Shuhei Nakamoto as Senior Technical Director. Willis had been told to stop going to races in order to focus on aerodynamics, which appeared to conflict with the appointment of Mariano Alperin-Bruvera to head the aerodynamics group using Honda's new full-size wind tunnel.  Willis eventually left the team later in the year. On 17 July 2007, Willis was hired by Red Bull Racing as the team's Technical Director, once again under Newey. He left Red Bull in July 2009 for unknown reasons.Willis joined the new Hispania Racing F1 Team in March 2010. In September 2011 he left HRT, reportedly because the team had not assured him of necessary financial backing for designing the car for 2012 Formula One season and joined Mercedes as Technology director on 17 October 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jenson Button", "response": ["In , Button again drove with Honda alongside Barrichello. He was unable to partake in pre-season testing because of two hairline fractures to his ribs, sustained in a karting incident in late 2006. His Honda RA107 car had an aerodynamic imbalance from lacking grip after Shuhei Nakamoto was appointed Senior Technical Director following the departure of Geoff Willis. His year was worse than in 2006, driving within the middle of the field and usually qualifying outside of the top ten. He scored six points over the course of the season for 15th overall with a best finish of fifth at the rain-affected ."]}, {"page": "Patrick Head", "response": ["Many of the top engineers in Formula One, such as Adrian Newey, Neil Oatley, Ross Brawn, Frank Dernie, Paddy Lowe, Eghbal Hamidy, Geoff Willis and Enrique Scalabroni have worked under Head's supervision early in their careers, and all have moved on to senior positions within other teams. Brawn in particular has had success as Head's opposite number at Benetton, Ferrari, Brawn GP and Mercedes. Adrian Newey has also had success at McLaren, and more recently Red Bull Racing, and he is considered one of the most successful engineers in Formula One."]}, {"page": "Red Bull Racing", "response": ["Red Bull Racing further strengthened their technical department by hiring Geoff Willis as Technical Director on 17 July 2007."]}, {"page": "Dallara", "response": ["Dallara built the cars for Hispania's entry in the  season. The Hispania team's financial problems\u2014which delayed payment of money owed to Dallara and the completion of the cars\u2014and the alleged low quality of the F110 chassis resulted in the two parties officially ending their partnership in May 2010. The car was used in all 2010 races without any development except the graphics. They had only one aerodynamic configuration, used for all races, including Monte Carlo and Monza. Geoff Willis, who joined Hispania in March 2010, criticized the F110, saying that he was disappointed at the quality and level of engineering in the car and that the design of the car was missing a lot of contemplating practices commonly employed in the process of building a Formula One car."]}]}}
