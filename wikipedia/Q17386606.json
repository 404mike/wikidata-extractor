He quickly gained popularity despite his haphazard broadcasting style because he used his backing singer skills to introduce songs - blending his voice into the song.\nPeach joined BBC Radio 1 in 1984 presenting a Saturday evening show called Midnight Runner which specialised in American style rock and funk. He was the third black Radio DJ (after Al Matthews and Ranking Miss P) on Radio 1. On TV he hosted editions of Top of the Pops.In 1987 he left Radio 1 and in 1991 he joined CNFM where he hosted the morning show, he later departed from the station in late 1992 and joined BFBS Radio where he presented Music Choice Europe. A keen music fan, Peach has recorded backing vocals on songs for Elton John and Hall & Oates.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Top of the Pops presenters", "response": ["*Dixie Peach (1985\u20131986)", "*25 December 1985 \u2013 Jonathan King was guest presenter alongside John Peel, Janice Long, Dixie Peach, Steve Wright and Gary Davies"]}]}}
