It was founded in 1810 by local lawyer William Wilshere in a disused malthouse. This schoolroom was the first monitorial school for the sons of the poor in Hertfordshire. Teaching was based on Joseph Lancaster's methods of monitorial teaching. He developed a system in which large numbers of younger scholars could be taught by older scholars under the supervision of the master (for boys) or mistress (for girls). This method continued until the Revised Code of 1862 that brought in the Pupil Teacher method of teaching.Richard Aldrich, An Introduction to the History of Education (London, 1982), p.55. The monitorial system was changed as it was the general consensus that having children teach other children, when they are not well educated themselves, proved to be problematic. The Pupil Teacher method involved an older scholar being given training and being paid to teach. The government hoped that this would increase the number of teachers in the future, using a system that could be described as an apprenticeship in teaching.P.H.J.H. Gosden, How They Were Taught (Oxford, 1969), p.16."]}, {"page": "William Wilshere", "response": ["William Wilshere (1806 \u2013 10 November 1867)Leigh Rayment was a British  Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1837 to 1847.", "He was the son of Thomas Wilshere of The Frythe and his wife Lora, daughter of Charles Beaumont of Houghton, Huntingdonshire.

Hunt reported on possible development of the prison in 1816, for a committee including the sessions chairman William Wilshere. A printed report from the Bedford magistrates appeared in 1818, and Henry Grey Bennet cited Hunt on prison discipline from it; and in the debate leading to the Prisons Act 1823 Hunt suggested a clause on transfer of prisoners to Bennet."]}, {"page": "William Wilshere (1754-1824)", "response": ["#REDIRECT :William Wilshere (1754\u20131824)"]}]}}
