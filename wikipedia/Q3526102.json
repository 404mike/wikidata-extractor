Vine also played two Test matches for England and was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1906.\nVine's cricket career was not one of a rapid rise to fame. Although he played his first first-class match in 1896, it was not until 1900, after some tentative appearances in the three previous seasons, that he earned a regular place in the Sussex eleven. After that, however, he was indispensable. He was essentially a county cricketer, nearly all his work having been done for Sussex, but if, in addition to his batting and fielding, he had managed to retain his skill as a leg-break bowler it is quite likely that he would have played for England before he played his two Test matches in 1911/2. Already a dependable player, he made a great advance as a batsman in 1904 and during 1905 he was better than he had ever been before, scoring for Sussex in county matches alone over sixteen hundred runs. Good as his position is he would probably have been thought still more of if he had belonged to another county. A batsman would need to be great indeed to play on the same side as Ranjitsinhji and C.B. Fry, and not be overshadowed. His success as a batsman was largely gained in a series of first-wicket partnerships with Fry, and though he may at times carry caution a little too far and keep an undue check on his hitting powers, the result is nearly always so satisfactory that it would be sheer hypercriticism to find fault with him. As an outfield Vine has not the wonderful pick-up of Denton, but in every other respect was in the highest class, and in the course of a season at the beginning of the twentieth century, perhaps no one saved a larger number of runs. \nIn total Vine played 547 first-class matches, which included 421 consecutive appearances for Sussex. Soon after retiring from county cricket Joe Vine became coach at Brighton College, an office he held for many years. He died aged 70 in 1946.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1905 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 David Denton, Walter Lees, George Thompson, Joe Vine, Levi Wright"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Joe Vine"]}, {"page": "Sussex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Joe Vine"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Joe Vine \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Joseph Vine", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Vine"]}, {"page": "1905 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden - David Denton, Walter Lees, George Thompson, Joe Vine, Levi Wright"]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1902", "response": ["At Hastings the Australians very nearly suffered what would have been their third defeat, with the South, captained by WG Grace, being only eight runs short of victory when time ran out. The tourists made a partial recovery from 94/5 thanks to Noble (63) and Hopkins (74), supported by Trumble, but after Hopkins was the seventh man out the end came quickly, Cuthbert Burnup taking three of the last four wickets to return figures of 3/22. Braund took 4/88. The South were 53/0 in reply by the end of the first day. Next day, Burnup and Abel took their first wicket stand to 122, Hayward made 106 in 180 minutes, and most of the other batsmen made useful contributions. Grace declared overnight, with Noble having taken 4/89. Next day the tourists made a good start. But after Duff was the first man out with the score at 102, Trumper stood almost alone, eventually being out for 120. Joe Vine took 7/31. With the pitch seemingly helping the spinners, Trumble and Armstrong shared the 22 overs that were possible in the South's second innings before time ran out. In the context of a run-chase, Armstrong did well to concede only 36 runs from his 11 overs, and took two wickets. Trumble had figures of 3/47."]}, {"page": "Central Recreation Ground", "response": ["The Central Recreation Ground also hosted many games aside from Hastings Festival matches. Australian teams played at the ground 18 times, with one match in 1878 involving a side with eighteen Hastings players, of whom six played for Kent, three played for Sussex and three played for Surrey. In a 1902 match between Sussex and Surrey at the ground, C.B. Fry and Joe Vine scored an opening partnership of 238 runs, and KS Ranjitsinhji scored the first double-century at the ground, as Sussex scored 705\u20138d, the highest total in a first-class match at the ground. The match also saw Surrey batsmen Bobby Abel and Thomas Hayward score an opening partnership of 246, the highest partnership ever for the first wicket in a match at the Central Recreation Ground. In 1908, a match took place at the ground between an English 11 and the Melbourne Cricket Club. A first-class match between Sussex and Kent in 1984 ended in a tie. In the same year, the England women's cricket team played a 55 overs a side One Day International match against New Zealand. Jan Brittin scored 101, as England scored 194\u20138, and in reply New Zealand made 148\u20137.
