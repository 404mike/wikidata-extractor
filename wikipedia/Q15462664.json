Wrigley and Peter Laslett co-founded the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure in 1964.\nWrigley's scholarly works focus on demographic history, and the long-term causes and effects of urbanization and industrialization. Among his many publications, Wrigley is known for the book Continuity, Chance and Change, published in 1988, in which he explained why Malthus was wrong about the law of diminishing returns slowing population growth. His most celebrated work, however, is The Population History of England, 1541-1871, published in 1981 with co-author Roger S. Schofield.\nWrigley completed undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Peterhouse, Cambridge between 1949-1958. He was elected as a Fellow of Peterhouse in the latter year and held office until 1979, when he became an Emeritus Fellow there and also Professor of Population Studies at the London School of Economics. He ceased the professorship in 1988 to become a Senior Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford and returned to Cambridge as Professor of Economic History for the period 1994-1997. As of 2019, he was an Honorary Fellow at Peterhouse. He was Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge from 1994 until 2000, and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1980, serving as president from 1997 to 2001. He was also a member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the recipient of the 2005 Leverhulme Medal and Prize awarded by the British Academy and in the same year became a Quondam Fellow of All Souls College.In 1960, Wrigley married Mieke Spelberg, with whom by 1972 he had three daughters and a son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 17", "response": ["*1931 \u2013 Tony Wrigley, English historian, demographer, and academic"]}, {"page": "Economic history", "response": ["* Tony Wrigley"]}, {"page": "British Academy", "response": ["*Sir Tony Wrigley 1997\u20132001"]}, {"page": "Peter Laslett", "response": ["Laslett was the son of a Baptist minister and was born in Bedford on 18 December 1915. Although he spent much of his childhood in Oxford, he was educated at the Watford Grammar School for Boys.

After a period working on protection of Arctic convoys, Laslett then learned Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve as a lieutenant and worked on decoding Japanese naval intelligence. He was stationed first at Bletchley Park and later, after VE Day, in Washington, DC. It was at Bletchley Park that he met his future wife, Janet Crockett Clark, whom he married in 1947.Richard Smith, 'Laslett, (Thomas) Peter Ruffell (1915\u20132001)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition, Oxford University Press, January 2005; online edition, May 2006", "Laslett took up an entirely different line of historical research from the early 1960s. Trying to understand 17th-century listings of the inhabitants of Clayworth and Cogenhoe, Northamptonshire, he became persuaded of the need to pursue historical demography more systematically. In 1964, Laslett and Tony Wrigley co-founded the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure. With funding from the Social Science Research Council, the Cambridge Group worked alongside amateur volunteers on local records, and established the journal Local Population Studies."]}, {"page": "Gold Medal (RGS)", "response": ["| Tony Wrigley||"]}, {"page": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge", "response": ["* Tony Wrigley"]}, {"page": "E A Wrigley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Wrigley "]}, {"page": "E.A.
