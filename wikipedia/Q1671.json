He is the 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medalist in both the 5000 m and 10,000 m. Farah is the second athlete, after Lasse Vir\u00e9n, to win both the 5000 m and 10,000 m titles at successive Olympic Games. He also completed the 'distance double' at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships in Athletics. He was the second man, after Kenenisa Bekele, to win long-distance doubles at successive Olympics and World Championships, and the first in history to defend both distance titles in both major global competitions \u2013 a feat described as the 'quadruple-double'. Since finishing 2nd in the 10,000 metres at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, Farah had an unbroken streak of ten global final wins (the 5000m in 2011, the 10,000m in 2017 and the double in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016). The streak ended in Farah's final championship track race, when he finished second to Ethiopia's Muktar Edris in the 2017 5000 metres final. In his final track race, the 2017 Diamond League Final in Zurich in August 2017, Farah gained his revenge, edging out world champion Edris to win his only IAAF Diamond League title at 5000 metres.\nOn the track, he mostly competed over 5000 metres and 10,000 metres, but has run competitively from 1500 metres to the marathon. In 2017, he indicated his intention to switch wholly to road racing following victory at his final track race, the 2017 IAAF Diamond League 5000 metres final. His running style has been described as bouncy and tactical, which he has attempted to alter for a more efficient and energy-saving stride pattern, especially in the longer distances. Farah runs distance races tactically, a style which is aided by his quick sprint finish.Born in Mogadishu, Somalia, to a family from Gabiley, Somaliland, Farah moved to London as a child and ran for Newham and Essex Beagles athletics club, training at St Mary's University College, Twickenham from 2001 to 2011. Farah is the European record holder for the 10,000 m, half marathon, marathon, and two miles, the British record holder for the 5000 m, the British indoor record holder for the 3000 m and the current world record holder for the one hour run and indoor world record holder for the two miles.\nFarah is the most decorated athlete in British athletics history, with ten global titles. He was the first British athlete to win two gold medals at the same world championships. His five gold medals at the European Athletics Championships make him the most successful athlete in individual events in the championships' history. He has won the European Athlete of the Year award and the British Athletics Writers Association British Athlete of the Year award more than any other athlete, three times and six times respectively. In 2017, Farah won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\nFarah was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2013 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to athletics.\nHe won the 2018 Chicago Marathon in a time of 2:05:11, a European record.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 23", "response": ["*  1983   \u2013 Mo Farah, Somali-English runner"]}, {"page": "1983", "response": ["* March 23 \u2013 Mo Farah, Somali-born British athlete"]}, {"page": "Flagstaff, Arizona", "response": ["Flagstaff is also a popular destination for altitude training.

Jones was unaware of the record and, since he never wore a watch, did not know that he might break it until two miles before the finish. He won the 1985 London Marathon in 2:08:16 despite stopping to go to the toilet during the event; Jones later said, \"I didn't even train for [the race]\", instead continuing to coach himself. Aware that he was \"one hamstring tear away from oblivion\", Jones remained with the RAF despite earning large sums per race. In August 1985, he broke the world record for the half marathon, running 61:14 in Birmingham.  On 20 October of that year he achieved his personal best marathon time of 2:07:13 in winning the Chicago Marathon, only one second slower than the world record run by Carlos Lopes at the Rotterdam Marathon earlier that same year.

She was later indirectly identified as a suspected doper by MP Jesse Norman during a parliamentary inquiry into blood doping. In response, Radcliffe issued a statement in which she \"categorically denied\" cheating in any form and said she has \"nothing to hide\". Shortly afterwards, her three suspect test results were leaked, though Radcliffe still refused to release her complete blood-test history. In late November 2015, the IAAF declared that the accusations were \"based on the gross misinterpretation of incomplete data\". The UK Anti Doping Agency, having received Radcliffe's blood test history via the IAAF, stated that \"UKAD has come to the same conclusion as the IAAF review that there is no case to answer\". It is likely that the first suspicious off-score was caused by faulty equipment. The third suspicious off-score was the direct result of an altitude training trip in Kenya with Mo Farah and other British athletes."]}, {"page": "List of people on the postage stamps of the United Kingdom", "response": ["*Mo Farah (2012)"]}, {"page": "Alastair Campbell", "response": ["In January 2014, Campbell announced that he was joining British GQ with a brief to conduct interviews with figures from \"politics... sport, business, culture, (and) other aspects of life that I find interesting\", succeeding Piers Morgan.
