Former Scotland and Lions full-back Andy Irvine was appointed as tour manager in 2010. Wales head coach Warren Gatland was the Lions' head coach, and their tour captain was Sam Warburton. The tour started in Hong Kong with a match against the Barbarians before moving on to Australia for the main tour featuring six provincial matches and three tests. The Lions won all but one non-test matches, losing to the Brumbies 14\u201312 on 18 June. The first test was followed shortly after this, which saw the Lions go 1-up over Australia winning 23\u201321. Australia did have a chance to take the win in the final moments of the game, but a missed penalty by Kurtley Beale saw the Lions take the win. The Wallabies drew the series in the second test winning 16\u201315, though the Lions had a chance to steal the win had it not been because of a missed penalty by Leigh Halfpenny. With tour captain Warburton out of the final test due to injury, Alun Wyn Jones took over the captaincy in the final test in Sydney. The final test was won by the Lions in what was a record win, winning 41\u201316 to earn their first series win since 1997 and their first over Australia since 1989.", "| Sam Warburton Alun Wyn Jones", "| Alun Wyn Jones ", "|align=\"left\"| Alun Wyn Jones"]}, {"page": "Rugby union", "response": ["The most capped international player from the tier 1 nations is Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones who has played over 150 internationals."]}, {"page": "Six Nations Championship", "response": ["| Alun Wyn Jones"]}, {"page": "September 19", "response": ["*  1985   \u2013 Alun Wyn Jones, Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "1985", "response": ["** Alun Wyn Jones, Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Swansea", "response": ["* Alun Wyn Jones: 13 June 2019."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Alun Wyn Jones, current captain of Wales and the Ospreys (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["Sports science at the university leapt from 40th to 8th in the 2015 Guardian University Guide.
