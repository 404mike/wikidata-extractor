As a young man he worked as an apprentice to a carpenter and later worked in some of the larger houses in the area, such as Dolserau, Nannau, Hengwrt and Caerynwch. \nHe had developed an interest in poetry at a young age, and was possibly quite influenced by his meeting with Thomas Edwards (Twm o'r Nant) at the age of 13. In 1853 he began publishing his own work (including a number of englynion and carols) on various subjects, often dealing with local occurrences: Diliau Meirion (1853) \u2013 followed in 1854 by a second part (with a preface by Griffith Griffiths); Hanes Teithiau a Helyntion Meurig Ebrill gyda 'Diliau Meirion\u2019 o Ddolgellau i Gaerlleon-Gawr, Birkenhead, Llynlleifiad, a Manceinion, a'i Ddychweliad yn ol Drwy Siroedd a Threfydd Gogledd Cymru yn 1854\u201355 (1855). \nHe died in September 1861.", "link_mentions": {}}}
