As a cricketer, he was described in Scores and Biographies as \"a really good batsman,an energetic field at cover-point\". Scores and Biographies speculated that if Webbe continued in the game that he would \"perhaps excel\". However, his 1878 appearance would be his last in first-class cricket. He was aide-de-camp to the Inspector-General of Cavalry at Aldershot Garrison, Sir Frederick Fitzwygram, from 1879 to 1884. He gained the rank of captain in October 1882, with his retirement from active service following in March 1886. Webbe later served as a Deputy lieutenant of Aberdeen, to which he was appointed in March 1888. Webbe died in February 1925 at Ascot. His brothers were A. J. and Herbert Webbe, who were also first-class cricketers. He was survived by his wife, Lady Cecilia Leila Hay, daughter of William Hay, 19th Earl of Erroll.Peer Bereaved.
