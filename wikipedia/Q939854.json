A striker, Nicholas is best known for his spells at Celtic and Arsenal. He won 20 international caps for Scotland, including playing at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nNicholas began his career at Celtic, and by the age of 21 was considered the most exciting emerging talent in British football. With several English clubs keen to sign him, he joined Arsenal in the summer of 1983. He spent over four years there, and scored both their goals in their League Cup Final win over Liverpool in 1987. Nicholas fell out of favour at Highbury later that year, and moved back to Scotland to join Aberdeen. He won two Cup Finals in his time at Pittodrie, before rejoining Celtic in 1990. His second spell at Parkhead was less successful than his first, but he spent five seasons there before moving on to Clyde for one season before retiring from playing.\nSince retiring he has worked in the media, most recently on the Sky Sports show Soccer Saturday, until August 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 30", "response": ["*  1961   \u2013 Charlie Nicholas, Scottish footballer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Celtic F.C.", "response": ["* Charlie Nicholas"]}, {"page": "Maryhill", "response": ["* Charlie Nicholas, footballer"]}, {"page": "Old Firm", "response": ["|align=left|Charlie Nicholas"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Charlie Nicholas \u2013 Sky Sports 2001\u20132020"]}, {"page": "Billy McNeill", "response": ["McNeill is credited with developing young players for Celtic, such as Paul McStay and Charlie Nicholas, and making signings such as Murdo MacLeod and Davie Provan who became key players for the club through the 1980s. However, McNeill found working with Desmond White, Celtic's chairman, very difficult, and felt underpaid and underappreciated. Despite Celtic's successes, by 1983 he was being paid less than the managers of Aberdeen, Dundee United, Rangers and St Mirren. When White sold Nicholas to Arsenal, against McNeill's wishes, McNeill looked for the first available way out, and took up the offer to manage Manchester City."]}, {"page": "Roy Keane", "response": ["During his time at Celtic, Keane was suggested as a potential managerial successor to Gordon Strachan by former Celtic player Charlie Nicholas. However, it was Championship club Sunderland where Keane chose to launch his managerial career, reuniting him with the club's chairman and outgoing manager, Niall Quinn. The two men, publicly at least, were on opposing sides during the fall-out from the Saipan incident, but they were on good terms at the time of the managerial appointment, with Quinn urging Sunderland fans to \"support and enjoy one of football's true greats\"."]}, {"page": "Kenny Sansom", "response": ["Sansom won more domestic silverware in 1987, captaining Arsenal to a League Cup final victory over Liverpool at Wembley; Arsenal came from a goal down to win 2\u20131, with Sansom starting the move which had led to Arsenal's late winner, scored by Charlie Nicholas."]}, {"page": "Brian Laudrup", "response": ["Laudrup has been praised by several players, managers, pundits, and footballing figures for his footballing ability, including Charlie Nicholas, Roland Wohlfarth, Charlie Nicholas, Ally McCoist, and Andy Goram. Franz Beckenbauer described Laudrup as \"a world class player,\" a view shared by Andreas Brehme, who described him as a \"player of the highest quality class.\" Paul Gascoigne instead dubbed him an \"amazing player.\"Glorious: My World, Football and Me, Paul Gascoigne (book) Laudrup's older brother, Michael, likened Brian's playing style to his own, and even believed his younger brother to be superior to himself. His former manager Horst Wohlers named him as the best player he had ever coached, and as the top footballer in the Bundesliga during their time together at Bayer Uerdingen. In December 2013, Graeme Le Saux named Lu\u00eds Figo and Brian Laudrup as his toughest opponents ever. Walter Smith's view of Laudrup was more critical however, lauding his ability but also lamenting his mentality, which he believed limited him as a player, commenting: \"Brian Laudrup is as good a player as I have ever worked with, but he frustrated me. He had the capability of being up there with the greatest players of all time. There was just that little bit in him mentally that stopped him from being right at the very top. Make no mistake, he was a fantastic player for us, but he could have elevated himself into a position where he was one of the best in the world.\""]}, {"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["Scotland began their qualifying campaign for the 1986 FIFA World Cup with a 3\u20130 win over Iceland at Hampden Park in October 1984. Paul McStay scored twice in the first half, and came close to getting a hat-trick when he struck the crossbar in the second half. Charlie Nicholas scored Scotland's third goal. Stein observed that Scotland \"won with style\" and singled out winger Davie Cooper along with McStay for the flair they both displayed. The Scots turned in an even better showing in their next tie, a 3\u20131 home win over Spain. Two first half headed goals from Mo Johnston gave Scotland a 2\u20130 lead at half-time. Spain pulled a goal back in the second half, but with 18 minutes remaining Kenny Dalglish dribbled past three Spanish defenders before striking a powerful shot high into the net for Scotland's third. It was Dalglish's 30th international goal, equalling the record held by Denis Law. Stein described the win over Spain as \"the most satisfying since I became [Scotland] manager\", adding that \"we scored three goals against a quality team that came to defend\". Spanish manager Miguel Mu\u00f1oz praised the Scots' performance, describing them as \"tremendous\". Performances and results were more mixed in the later qualifying ties, losing the return match in Spain, going down to a 1\u20130 defeat against Wales in Glasgow and scraping a narrow 1\u20130 win over Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk. Scotland went into their last qualifying tie, away to Wales, needing at least a draw to secure a play-off spot."]}]}}
