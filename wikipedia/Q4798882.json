Born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, he began his football career with Seaton Main and Mansfield Town before joining Birmingham in July 1911. He made his debut in the Second Division on 21 October 1911 away at Gainsborough Trinity, stepping in at left back to allow regular incumbent Frank Womack to replace the injured Billy Ball at right back. The game finished goalless, and was the only first-team appearance he made for Birmingham. In 1912 he signed for Lincoln City, but returned to Mansfield without playing first-team football.", "link_mentions": {}}}
