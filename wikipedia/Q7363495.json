At the time of his election he was the only independent PCC not to have a background in policing. After a four-decade long career in aviation as an airline pilot on both commercial and cargo flights he was elected to the newly created office of Police and Crime Commissioner on 15 November 2012. One of his first acts in the post was to endorse an alliance with a neighbouring police force aimed at pooling resources and reducing overall costs. Although his role was a non-operational one, he requested a review of a police investigation into a motoring accident that left several people injured, citing public concerns over the incident. After it emerged that police officers who held a meeting with former Conservative Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell following his involvement in the Plebgate affair had not given a proper account of their conversation, Ball became caught up in the affair after criticising the findings of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) which recommended the officers be disciplined. Ball did not contest the 2016 election for the post, and was succeeded by Philip Seccombe of the Conservative Party.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Plaskitt", "response": ["In 2012 Plaskitt was selected as the Labour candidate for the Police and Crime Commissioner election for the Warwickshire Police.

This prompted the IPCC's Deputy Chair, Deborah Glass, to respond with clarification of its conclusions. In a letter to Ball, Glass said that West Mercia had changed its mind over whether to discipline the officers before the final publication of its report. Her comments led to media speculation that senior police officers could have interfered with the investigation. Ball subsequently requested a review of West Mercia's inquiry. \"That is a very serious allegation and I want to understand the exact circumstances of the investigative approval process.\" West Mercia then launched an investigation into issues raised by the IPCC.", "On 21 October 2013, the three officers concernedKen MacKaill, Stuart Hinton, and Chris Jonesissued a statement in which they apologised for their \"poor judgement\" in briefing the media about their meeting, and said that they did not intend to mislead the public. Along with their respective Chief Constables, the three officers appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 23 October in which they told MPs their account of the meeting with Mitchell had been \"accurate\" and they stood by it. The Committee subsequently called them back, believing that they had misled it. In November 2013 the IPCC announced it would conduct its own investigation into the behaviour of the officers. In the wake of the announcement, Ron Ball expressed his concerns about the legality of a new investigation."]}, {"page": "Ron Ball (police commissioner)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ron Ball"]}, {"page": "Ronald Ball", "response": ["*Ron Ball (born 1950), first elected police commissioner (PCC) for Warwickshire"]}, {"page": "2016 United Kingdom local elections", "response": ["|Ron Ball (Independent)"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire Police and Crime Commissioner", "response": ["| Ron Ball || Independent || 15 November 2012 \u2013 5 May 2016"]}]}}
