He began playing for Nottinghamshire in 1879 and  for Northamptonshire from 1880. In 1884, against Essex, he took all the wickets for Northamptonshire apart from one run out in the first innings. He made his first-class debut for Surrey in 1885 and became a formidable member of the Surrey attack with George Lohmann and Jack Beaumont. Bowley had a hand in changing the rules of cricket to allow declaration. In a match between Surrey and Sussex in 1887,  Surrey had set up a big lead and wanted to have a go at Sussex on a deteriorating pitch while Sussex wanted to hang on for a draw. Bowley, last man in, tried to get stumped but the wicketkeeper refused, and Sussex prolonged the innings by sending down a succession of no-balls. Eventually, Bowley kicked down his own stumps. However enough time had been lost to let  Sussex hold the draw.One of Bowley\u2019s best bowling performances was in 1889 when he took six Derbyshire wickets for 13 runs at Derby.  In his first class career, he also played for the North, Players of the South and CI Thornton\u2019s XI.  He was an umpire for North v South and Players v Gentlemen between 1883 and 1893.\nBowley was right-arm fast bowler and took 264 first-class wickets at an average of 16.82 and a best performance of 7 for 64. He was a right-handed batsman and played 111 innings in 83 first-class matches at an average of 8.58 and a top score of 46.In 1894, Bowley was appointed cricket coach at Sherborne School and held the position for seventeen years. He also played for Dorset for several years.  Bowley also played for Dorset in the Minor Counties Championship from 1897 to 1902.Bowley died in Sherborne, Dorset at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Thomas Bowley "]}, {"page": "1886 English cricket season", "response": ["|Thomas Bowley || Surrey || 3899 || 1219 || 88 || 13.85 || 7/64 || 5 || 1"]}, {"page": "Tom Buckland", "response": ["Buckland made two first-class appearances for Nottinghamshire in 1888, against Sussex and Surrey, with both matches played at Trent Bridge.  In his first match, Sussex won the toss and elected to bat, making 97 all out in their first-innings, with Buckland taking the wickets of Walter Andrews and Walter Humphreys to finish with figures of 2/13 from thirteen overs.  Nottinghamshire responded in their first-innings by making 240 all out, with Buckland ending the innings not out on 9.  Sussex were then dismissed for just 69 in their second-innings, with Buckland once again taking two wickets, those of Willie Quaife and Andrews, taking figures of 2/20 from fourteen overs.  Nottinghamshire won by an innings and 74 runs.  In his second match, Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 187 all out, with Buckland scoring 12 runs before he was dismissed by Thomas Bowley.  Surrey responded to that by making 237 all out in their first-innings, during which he bowled seventeen wicketless overs, conceding 25 runs.  In their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 131 all out, with Buckland run out for 2, to set Surrey 82 for victory.  Surrey reached that target in their second-innings with just one wicket lost, with Buckland bowling eight wicketless overs in it."]}, {"page": "Bowley, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Bowley"]}]}}
