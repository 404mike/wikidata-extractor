When told of Taylor's death by Ron Fenton, Clough apparently did not speak, put the phone down on him and cried heavily. He also, while very upset, made a phone call to the Taylor family. Clough, along with the rest of his family, attended the funeral 12 days later at St Peter's Church, Widmerpool as did around 250 people, including Colin Todd, Peter Withe and Archie Gemmill. Clough dedicated his 1994 autobiography to Taylor saying \"To Peter. Still miss you badly. You once said: 'When you get shot of me there won't be as much laughter in your life'. You were right.\""]}]}}
