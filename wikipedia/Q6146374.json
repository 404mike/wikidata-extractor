She has received several positive reviews for her work. She plays acoustic cello and electric cello.\nSieber began to learn the cello at age seven. Growing up in classical music she played as part of the cello section of Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphony (GTCYS) in Minneapolis. She moved to Seattle in 1977 and then met Charlie Murphy in 1979. They began touring as a folk duo for five years before evolving into a full-scale progressive rock band: Rumors of the Big Wave. She later left the progressive rock band and instead became a solo artist, producing six independent albums, four of which she has made available at Magnatune. Several of her pieces can be heard in the video game Braid. She has composed for dance (Llory Wilsom and Tallulah Dance Co, Jeff Bickford, The Equus Projects), film (Big Joy, 2012; Queen of the Sun, 2010), and theatre (TS Crossing).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeless", "response": ["* Timeless, by Jami Sieber, 2013"]}, {"page": "Second Sight", "response": ["* \"Second Sight\", an album by Jami Sieber"]}, {"page": "Jupiters Darling", "response": ["* Jami Sieber \u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "Braid (video game)", "response": ["Braid features licensed music from Magnatune artists Cheryl Ann Fulton, Shira Kammen and Jami Sieber. Part of Blow's decision to use licensed music was to reduce development costs. He also felt that those who regularly compose video game music did not have the necessary skills needed to create the mood he wanted for the game. He ultimately selected eight tracks that were sufficiently long to avoid notable looping while a player attempted to solve a difficult puzzle, and that provided a \"different and interesting\" sound when played in reverse to match the reverse time mechanic of the gameplay. Blow also selected tracks that were \"organic and complex\" as to help set the game's mood and aimed \"to present something that isn't necessarily clear-cut\". The selection of the music influenced the creation of the background artwork for the game. Both Kammen and Sieber received favorable feedback from listeners as a result of their works' inclusion in Braid. Magnatune released a soundtrack of the game's music on April 9, 2009, which includes two additional track remixes that incorporate some of the time-shifting elements from the game. The pieces included in Braid are:", "* \"Maenam\" by Jami Sieber, from Hidden Sky", "* \"Undercurrent\" by Jami Sieber, from Lush Mechanique", "* \"The Darkening Ground\" by Jami Sieber, from Lush Mechanique", "* \"Tell It by Heart\" by Jami Sieber, from Second Sight", "* \"Long Past Gone\" by Jami Sieber, from Second Sight"]}, {"page": "When Elephants Were Young", "response": ["The film's soundtrack includes songs by Kate Bush/Placebo, Yusuf Islam/Cat Stevens, cellist Jami Sieber, Chris Caddell and the Wreckage, and Geoff Callaghan and The Schopenhauer Incident. The original music score is composed by Bruce Fowler."]}]}}
