In the early morning of January 8, Pakenham gave his final orders for the two-pronged assault. Colonel William Thornton was to cross the Mississippi during the night with his force of 780, move rapidly upriver, storm the battery commanded by Commodore Daniel Patterson on the flank of the main American entrenchments, and then open an enfilading fire on Jackson's line with the captured artillery, directly across from the earthworks manned by the vast majority of American troops. Keane was to lead a column along the river, and Major General Samuel Gibbs was to lead a column along the swamp. The brigade commanded by Major General John Lambert was held in reserve.", "Poor British planning and communication, plus costly frontal assaults against an entrenched enemy, caused lopsided British casualties. One source explains that, at New Orleans, \"naval support continued to be a problem ... and though the British force led by Colonel William Thornton was able to take control of the artillery, they arrived too late. By the time the Royal Navy delivered Thornton\u2019s troops, the battle was already lost\". Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane subsequently filed two reports with his own version of the battle where he controlled an armada with 8,000 men. The American Naval History and Heritage Command does not lay blame on any individual in the British forces, but concludes that the \"British then made a tactical error. Rather than pressing forward, they were allowed time to rest\". This source also mentions that forces from the ships finally decided to attack with 1,200 British sailors and marines, but \"after 36 hours of rowing, the invaders faced a hail of grape shot\".
