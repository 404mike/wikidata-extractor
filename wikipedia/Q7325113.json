He made his debut the following day in the 0\u20130 draw against Mansfield Town, he came on for Craig Farrell after 61 minutes and almost scored with his first touch, but his effort was well saved by Mansfield goalkeeper Alan Marriott. On 26 November, he came off the bench in the 1\u20130 win against Barrow, replacing Sean Newton after 68 minutes and scoring his first goal for the club. He headed in a Richard Davies cross on 76 minutes to give The Bucks their first league win in 9 outings. He made his first start for the club in the 1\u20131 draw against Luton Town three days later. Jones scored in the 2\u20132 draw with Stockport County on 24 January 2012. In the 0\u20130 draw with Alfreton Town on 3 March, Jones suffered a knee ligament injury that would keep him out of action for up to six weeks. He made his return from injury on 17 April, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute in the 1\u20130 win against Tamworth. The win secured Telford's place in the Conference National for the following season. On 4 May, it was announced on Telford's website that Jones had agreed terms to a contract extension with the club."]}, {"page": "Mark Davies (footballer, born 1988)", "response": ["His younger brother Richard Davies is a professional footballer and currently plays for Northern Premier League Division One South side Chasetown."]}, {"page": "Richard Davies", "response": ["Richard Davies may refer to:", "* Richard Davies (Mynyddog) (1833\u20131877), poet in the Welsh language", "* Richard Davies (American actor) (1915\u20131994), American film actor", "* Richard Davies (Australian actor)", "* Richard Davies (Welsh actor) (1926\u20132015), Welsh actor", "* Richard Davies (writer) (born 1950), English writer and actor", "* Richard Davies (Tru Calling), fictional TV character", "* Richard Davies (musician) (born 1964), Australian singer-songwriter", "* Rick Davies (Richard Davies, born 1944), British musician, vocalist for Supertramp", "* Richard Davies (cricketer) (born 1954), former English cricketer", "* Richard Davies (footballer) (born 1990), footballer playing for Barrow AFC", "* Richard Davies (bishop) (c. 1505\u20131581), Welsh bishop and scholar", "* Richard Davies (courtier) (1916\u20131995), member of the Household of the Duke of Edinburgh", "* Richard Davies (doctor) (born 1959), British-born Falkland Islands and New Zealand doctor, New Zealand viceregal consort", "* Richard Davies (MP) (1818\u20131896), Member of Parliament for and Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey", "* Richard Davies (physician) (died 1761), English physician", "* Richard Davies (trade unionist), English trade union leader and politician"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Walsall F.C. season", "response": ["|Richard Davies"]}]}}
