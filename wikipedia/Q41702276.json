Thus, some maquis joined Communist groups simply to be part of a more active resistance movement and not because of their politics. Georges Guingouin was one of the most active Communist maquis leaders."]}, {"page": "Jan Swammerdam", "response": ["* Biography written by Matthew Cobb, a professor at Laboratoire d'Ecologie in Paris"]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["* Matthew Cobb, The Idea of the Brain: A History (Profile Books)"]}, {"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["*Life\u2019s Greatest Secret, Matthew Cobb  (Profile) "]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 637 || Smell || Matthew Cobb ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Organicism", "response": ["In the early 1930s Joseph Henry Woodger and Joseph Needham, together with Conrad Hal Waddington, John Desmond Bernal, Dorothy Needham, and Dorothy Wrinch, formed the Theoretical Biology Club, to promote the organicist approach to biology.

The Vichy French government cooperated closely with the Germans, sending food, machinery and workers to Germany. Several hundred thousand Frenchmen and women were forced to work in German factories, or volunteered to do so, as the French economy itself deteriorated. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. Most Jews were rounded up by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans, who sent them to death camps.Matthew Cobb, The Resistance: The French Fight against the Nazis (2009)Julian Jackson, France: The Dark Years, 1940\u20131944 (2003)"]}, {"page": "Cobb (surname)", "response": ["*Matthew Cobb (born 1957), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "Helen Keen", "response": ["In 2013 Keen was a guest on The Infinite Monkey Cage.Science and Spin 12/22/2013 04:00 PM \"This week on the Infinite Monkey Cage, Brian Cox and Robin Ince take to the stage at Manchester University, to discuss the state of science communication.

He evaluated 18 different proposed explanations for the stripes, devising and carrying out quantitative tests to compare them. The evolutionary ecologist Tim Birkhead, writing in the Times Higher Education, praised Caro's 2006 book Zebra Stripes as \"an exemplary study\", calling it \"one long argument\", a phrase used by Darwin of his On the Origin of Species, summarizing it as \"in essence a 300-page scientific paper\". Karin Brulliard, writing in The Washington Post under the headline \"To figure out why the zebra got its stripes, this researcher dressed up like one\", portrays Caro in a zebra costume \"not used in his fieldwork\", but also in a tailor-made striped suit in the Tanzanian bush, as well as in pelts of zebra and the unstriped wildebeest. The newspaper reports Caro as \"absolutely convinced\" that he has found the right explanation. Matthew Cobb, writing in New Scientist, recalls Rudyard Kipling's children's book, Just So Stories, in which the zebra got his stripes by standing half-in, half-out of the shadows \"with the slippery-slidy shadows of the trees\" on his body. Cobb calls Zebra Stripes a marvellous book and predicts it will encourage a generation to \"tackle evolutionary biology's remaining enigmas, with or without the help of Kipling.\""]}]}}
