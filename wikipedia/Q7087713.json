At the start of May Hogg again suffered an injury, this time twisting his ankle in training. When not sidelined with injury, Hogg was competing with Sajid Mahmood, Farveez Maharoof, Oliver Newby, and Tom Smith for a place in the team. His first appearance of the season was on 16 May in Lancashire's CB40 defeat to Somerset in which he conceded 63 runs from six over, taking a single wicket. Later that month Hogg played his first County Championship game of the season. He recorded his career best bowling figures, taking 7\u00a0wickets for 28\u00a0runs against Hampshire (surpassed in June 2013 by taking 7 Northants wickets for just 27 runs conceded) ; it was his second five-wicket haul and first since 2002. Lancashire went on to win the match by ten wickets with Hogg taking career best figures of 11/59 in the match. When Lancashire faced Yorkshire in the County Championship in July, Hogg scored a half-century and took a five-wicket haul to help his team to victory in the Roses match, reaching 150\u00a0first-class wickets in the process. Against Nottinghamshire Hogg took his third five-wicket haul of the season in the Championship. The 2011 season was Hogg's most successful: as well as recording his best first-class bowling figures Hogg took 50\u00a0wickets in the County Championship for the first time. He also scored 300\u00a0first-class runs at an average of 21.47. One of three bowlers to take at least 50\u00a0wickets in the County Championship for Lancashire that year, Hogg contributed to the club winning the competition for the first time since it shared the title with Surrey in 1950."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Oliver Newby (2008) : O.
