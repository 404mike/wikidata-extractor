H. Myers secretly funded a trip to French Morocco for half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via Gibraltar and Tangier to avoid Spanish Morocco and arrived at Marrakech. They rented a villa on the road to Casablanca and during that time Orwell wrote Coming Up for Air. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and Coming Up for Air was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a Dickens essay and it was in June 1939 that Orwell's father, Richard Blair, died.", "The Orwells spent some time in the North East, near Carlton, County Durham, dealing with matters in the adoption of a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair.\"He had led a quiet life as Richard Blair, not 'Richard Orwell'\": Shelden (1991: 398; 489) By September 1944 they had set up home in Islington, at 27b Canonbury Square.Orwell: Collected Works, I Have Tried to Tell the Truth, p. 283 Baby Richard joined them there, and Eileen gave up her work at the Ministry of Food to look after her family. Secker & Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm, planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for The Observer. Orwell had been looking for the opportunity throughout the war, but his failed medical reports prevented him from being allowed anywhere near action. He went to Paris after the liberation of France and to Cologne once it had been occupied by the Allies. Some of his reports were published in the Manchester Evening News."]}, {"page": "Bernard Crick", "response": ["In 1974, Crick started work on a biography of George Orwell with the help of Orwell's second wife Sonia Brownell. The hardback edition rights were used to set up a grant in conjunction with Birkbeck College to fund projects by new writers that would have interested Orwell. In 1980, just before the book was published, a friend of Crick's, David Astor, agreed to match the grant. Over the years there were contributions by  Richard Blair, Orwell's adopted son, and also The Observer newspaper, among others. Due to a lack of discernible projects, after five years the fund was diverted to produce an annual memorial lecture at Birkbeck College and the University of Sheffield, and also to provide small departmental grants. The lectures continue: they are now hosted each year by the Orwell Foundation (originally established by Crick as the Orwell Prize; see below) at University College London, home of the Orwell Archive; in November 2016 the Orwell Lecture was given by Ian Hislop. Previous lecturers include Rowan Williams and Hilary Mantel. In 2017, the Orwell Foundation and the Sir Bernard Crick Centre re-established a new Orwell Lecture in the North at the University of Sheffield: the inaugural lecture was given by Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry."]}, {"page": "Orwell Prize", "response": ["The British political theorist Sir Bernard Crick founded The Orwell Prize in 1993, using money from the royalties of the hardback edition of his biography of Orwell. Its current sponsors are Orwell's son Richard Blair, The Political Quarterly, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Orwell Estate's literary agents, A. M. Heath. The Prize was formerly sponsored by the Media Standards Trust and Reuters.

It was founded in 2011 with the aim of promoting the understanding and appreciation of the life and work of George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair 1903-1950). Its patron is Richard Blair, George Orwell\u2019s adopted son.", "In 2004, Dione Venables, of Finlay Publishers, published a revised edition Eric & Us, a memoir written by Jacintha Buddicom who died in 1994.  The book was originally published in 1974 by Leslie Frewin and focused on Eric Blair\u2019s childhood and teenage years. Buddicom was Venables' first cousin who left Venables the copyrights to the book in her will.  The acclaimed Orwell biographer, Gordon Bowker, in agreeing to review the book, suggested certain clarifications and in late 2006, \"Eric & Us: The Postscript Edition\" was published. The postscript edition was regularly discussed on a website called \u201cOrwell Direct\u201d, creating a small community of enthusiasts whose first contributor was Sir Bernard Crick. The community, which included Orwell's son Richard Blair, began to ask why there was no Society to promote the life and works of George Orwell, prompting Venables to focus her efforts on constituting one.", "On 27 December 2010, a group gathered for the first informal meeting at Phyllis Court, Henley-on-Thames (which the young Eric Blair had often visited). The day was hosted by Venables and, of those attending that day, Christopher Edwards agreed to be the society\u2019s first Chair. Richard Blair accepted the role as Patron, Charles Wiggin as Treasurer, Dominic Cavendish took on the editorship of the society\u2019s website, and Venables agreed to be Membership Secretary. Later on, Ron Bateman took on the Secretary role and Chris Organ was appointed to provide legal input.  The formal inaugural meeting was held on 19 April 2011 and in the same year, Quentin Kopp, whose father Georges Kopp had been Orwell\u2019s commandant and friend during and after the Spanish Civil War, joined the committee as Events Secretary and the society was launched.  On 28 April 2012, The Society held its first Annual General Meeting at Senate House, London \u2013 next to Room 101 (made famous in Nineteen Eighty-Four).", "Some historical antipathy towards George Orwell from the people of Wigan was rectified in 2017, 80 years after the publication of The Road to Wigan Pier, by demonstrating that Orwell had not been critical of Wigan people. Richard Blair participated as one of the narrators in \"Beyond Wigan Pier\", an opera first performed in 2018, aimed at attracting funding for students to attend Music & Drama school.", "On the 7th November 2017, a statue of Orwell sculpted by Martin Jennings, was unveiled outside Broadcasting House.  The idea for the statue and its location came from Ben Whitaker MP who created a Trustee Board of distinguished people to raise the money.  Following Ben Whitaker\u2019s death in 2014, the fund raising was completed by his widow Baroness Janet Whitaker and the sculpture was commissioned after securing the commitment of the BBC.  Baroness Whitaker and Richard Blair delivered short speeches before unveiling the Statue.  The wall behind the statue is engraved with the words: \"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\", a quote attributed to Orwell's proposed preface to Animal Farm. Baroness Whitaker and the Trustee Board invited The Orwell Society to take over ownership of the Statue. The handover was completed in 2021."]}, {"page": "Dione Venables", "response": ["In 2006, Venables created Finlay Publisher with the aim of promoting the life and works of the writer George Orwell. Finlay Publisher's first act was to print a new edition of Eric & Us, adding an important post-script written by Venables based on a series of previously unpublished diaries, letters and documented interviews. In August of the same year, Venables created a website called Orwell Direct, a forum for academics and enthusiasts alike to exchange views about Orwell. In 2008, the site began publishing a series of twenty articles written by scholars who had written at length about Orwell. They included Sir Bernard Crick, Gordon Bowker, DJ Taylor, Peter Davison, and Orwell's son, Richard Blair. Contributors encouraged Venables to institute a more formal collective of Orwell enthusiasts and on 27 December 2010, The Orwell Society was inaugurated by Venables at Phyllis Court. In 2015, she compiled and published Orwell's poetry, and in 2017, she published an account of her own war time experiences."]}, {"page": "Richard Blair", "response": ["Richard Blair or similar, may refer to:", "* Richard Blair (cricketer), English cricketer", "* Richard Blair (musician), founder of ChocQuibTown", "* Richard Blair-Oliphant, American composer of music for film and television", "* Richard Blair (patron) (born 1944), son of George Orwell"]}, {"page": "Richard H.
