A franker, and often less flattering portrait of police work than audience were used to seeing on Dixon of Dock Green, the show was an immediate hit, its popularity generating spin-offs like Softly, Softly (1966\u201376), Barlow at Large (1971\u201375), and Second Verdict (1976)."]}, {"page": "Z-Cars", "response": ["The one character present throughout the entire run (though not in every episode) was Bert Lynch, played by James Ellis (though John Phillips as Det.

The revival was produced by the BBC's serials department in a twice-weekly soap opera format of 25-minute episodes, and only James Ellis and Joseph Brady remained from the original show's run. It was shown from March 1967, both 25-minute segments each week comprising one story.", "Windsor made a final appearance as Watt in the last episode of Z-Cars, \"Pressure\", in September 1978, with Robins (John Phillips), the detective chief superintendent from the original series who had risen to chief constable.
