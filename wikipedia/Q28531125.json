He was the founder of The Queanbeyan Age, the first newspaper to serve the Queanbeyan district in New South Wales.  He was also an advocate for the Queanbeyan-Canberra area as the best site of a future Australian national capital, for which he is sometimes called the \"Father of Canberra\" (although that epithet is also applied to Sir Austin Chapman).  He served a single term as Member for Murrumbidgee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.", "Gale was born in Bodmin, Cornwall, England, in 1831 and educated at Monmouth Grammar School. He was apprenticed to the printing trade in 1846 and while learning this trade also completed his training to be a missionary.  John Gale arrived in Sydney, Australia, in 1853 on the 'American Lass' with six other young ministers. They were sent by the British Conference for special work in the gold fields as Methodist missionariesArticle by John Gale in the Gunning Methodist Church Jubilee booklet of 1926 (probationary ministers).  Gale was appointed to the Goulburn-Gunning Circuit, initially being put in charge of the Berrima section. However, within a year he was moved to the Gunning section where he covered a wide area which included the town (now city) of Queanbeyan in southern New South Wales (NSW).", "With the arrival of Annie Mercy, the first of Loanna and John Gale's 11 children, John Gale re-thought his future. Money was needed to provide food and shelter for his family and in order to start a business, and he would need capital to pay for office equipment and the leasehold of commercial premises. Fortunately, Gale's background in journalism and religious instruction provided him with the skills to teach and he soon acquired a paid position as a tutor with the Caldwell family at Moonbucca.Wheatley family records Gale also wrote to his elder brother, Peter Francis, a photographer living in England, and asked if he would emigrate to Australia. He requested also that his brother bring with him a printing press and assist in the starting of a newspaper business in Queanbeyan.  Peter Gale and his family obliged, and accompanied by the said printing press, sailed for Sydney, where they were met by Gale and his family.  The brothers and their families then travelled to Queanbeyan where, on 15 September 1860, they produced their first newspaper. This publication was initially called The Golden Age after the gold deposits that had been discovered locally, but within four years the gold was gone and in 1864 the paper's name was changed to The Queanbeyan Age.", "The Federal Government introduced in 1904 a parliamentary bill naming Dalgety as the Federal Capital site. NSW strenuously objected to the bill.  On 10 July 1907, Sir John Forrest, former Western Australian Premier, tabled his Report: \"An Unique Site for the Federal City\", as a formal minute in the House of Representatives in Melbourne. It contained \"nine factors\" each glorifying Dalgety and belittling Canberra. Some members of the NSW and Commonwealth parliaments approached John Gale and asked him to deal with Sir John's report. The result was Gale's now famous paper \"Dalgety or Canberra, Which?\", Gale read his paper on 24 July 1907 at a public meeting in Queanbeyan, where local residents dissented from the Commonwealth Parliament's choice of Dalgety. Queanbeyan Mayor Hinksman ordered that Gale's paper be printed and copies sent to every member of the seven Australian parliaments and to influential citizens.  Gale's paper, with its \"nine factors\" of logic and \"indisputable facts\", put Dalgety in the background and strengthened Canberra's case to be Australia's capital city .   ", "In 1907, former Australian prime ministers George Reid and J.C. Watson spoke strongly in favor of Canberra's claims to be the National Capital in speeches to the Commonwealth Parliament. Sir John Forrest, a vocal opponent of the Canberra option, said later that it was John Gale's pamphlet \"Dalgety or Canberra, Which?\" that won the day for Canberra as the preferred site, persuading him to alter his vote in its favour. Eventually, in 1908, Canberra was chosen as the site of Australia's National Capital.", "Sir Austin Chapman declared at the first Canberra land auction that: \"... if any man were entitled to be known as the Father of Canberra, it was veteran Queanbeyan journalist John Gale\". Charles  Daley quoted Chapman's words in various articles in The Canberra Times in the 1960s and also in his book, \"As I Recall\". He said that: \"... John Gale lived to see his vision realized, and he was invited to attend the opening of Parliament House at Canberra, on 9 May 1927, when he was presented to Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of York, ... who would wish to dispute his right to be acknowledged as the 'Father of Canberra?'\".", "A bronze statue of John Gale, titled \"The Father of Canberra\", is installed on the corner of Monaro and Lowe streets and Farrer Place, near Queanbeyan Courthouse.
