The volumes traced events from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688, and was a bestseller in its day. Hume was also a longtime friend of bookseller Andrew Millar, who sold Hume's History (after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton), although the relationship was sometimes complicated. Letters between them illuminate both men's interest in the success of the History. In 1762 Hume moved from Jack's Land on the Canongate to James Court on the Lawnmarket.

John Milton's Lycidas first appeared in such a collection. It has few Horatian echoesOne echo of Horace may be found in line 69: \"Were it not better done as others use,/ To sport with Amaryllis in the shade/Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?\", which points to the Neara in Odes 3.14.21 (Douglas Bush, Milton: Poetical Works, 144, note 69) yet Milton's associations with Horace were lifelong. He composed a controversial version of Odes 1.5, and Paradise Lost includes references to Horace's 'Roman' Odes 3.1\u20136 (Book 7 for example begins with echoes of Odes 3.4).J. Talbot, A Horatian Pun in Paradise Lost, 21\u20133 Yet Horace's lyrics could offer inspiration to libertines as well as moralists, and neo-Latin sometimes served as a kind of discrete veil for the risqu\u00e9. Thus for example Benjamin Loveling authored a catalogue of Drury Lane and Covent Garden prostitutes, in Sapphic stanzas, and an encomium for a dying lady \"of salacious memory\".B. Loveling, Latin and English Poems, 49\u201352, 79\u201383 Some Latin imitations of Horace were politically subversive, such as a marriage ode by Anthony Alsop that included a rallying cry for the Jacobite cause. On the other hand, Andrew Marvell took inspiration from Horace's Odes 1.37 to compose his English masterpiece Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland, in which subtly nuanced reflections on the execution of Charles I echo Horace's ambiguous response to the death of Cleopatra (Marvell's ode was suppressed in spite of its subtlety and only began to be widely published in 1776). Samuel Johnson took particular pleasure in reading The Odes.Cfr. James Boswell, \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\" Aetat. 20, 1729 where Boswell remarked of Johnson that Horace's Odes \"were the compositions in which he took most delight.\" Alexander Pope wrote direct Imitations of Horace (published with the original Latin alongside) and also echoed him in Essays and The Rape of the Lock. He even emerged as \"a quite Horatian Homer\" in his translation of the Iliad.D. Money, The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 329\u201331 Horace appealed also to female poets, such as Anna Seward (Original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from Horace, 1799) and Elizabeth Tollet, who composed a Latin ode in Sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of Horace's sympotic settings:"]}, {"page": "Henry Home, Lord Kames", "response": ["Henry Home, Lord Kames (169627 December 1782) was a Scottish writer, philosopher, advocate, judge, and agricultural improver.

Nathaniel Dance-Holland painted his portrait; he dined with James Boswell; he was described in the House of Lords as \"the first navigator in Europe\". But he could not be kept away from the sea.

He travelled to the Pacific and hoped to travel east to the Atlantic, while a simultaneous voyage travelled the opposite route."]}, {"page": "Joshua Reynolds", "response": ["Reynolds worked long hours in his studio, rarely taking a holiday. He was gregarious and keenly intellectual, with many friends from London's intelligentsia, numbered amongst whom were Dr Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Edmund Burke, Giuseppe Baretti, Henry Thrale, David Garrick, and artist Angelica Kauffman. Johnson said in 1778: \"Reynolds is too much under [Charles James] Fox and Burke at present. He is under the Fox star and the Irish constellation [meaning Burke]. He is always under some planet\".James Boswell, Life of Johnson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 923.", "In 1789, Reynolds lost the sight of his left eye, which forced him into retirement. In 1791 James Boswell dedicated his Life of Samuel Johnson to Reynolds. Reynolds  agreed with Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France and, writing in early 1791, expressed his belief that the ancien r\u00e9gime of France had fallen due to spending too much time tending, as he puts it, to the splendor of the foliage, to the neglect of the stirring the earth about the roots. They cultivated only those arts which could add splendor to the nation, to the neglect of those which supported it \u2013 They neglected Trade & substantial Manufacture\u00a0... but does it follow that a total revolution is necessary that because we have given ourselves up too much to the ornaments of life, we will now have none at all.McIntyre, p. 513.

Slight, he was about 5'6\" with dark brown curls, a florid complexion and features that James Boswell thought were \"rather too largely and strongly limned.\" He had a broad face and a cleft chin, and the bridge of his nose was slightly dented; his skin was scarred by smallpox and his upper lip disfigured as a result of falling from a horse as a young man.

In the meantime, the local ministers had become aware of the apostasies in some of his writings, and resolved not to let him stay in the vicinity. The Neuch\u00e2tel Consistory summoned Rousseau to answer a charge of blasphemy. He wrote back asking to be excused due to his inability to sit for a long time due to his ailment. Subsequently, Rousseau's own pastor, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Guillaume de Montmollin, started denouncing him publicly as the Antichrist. In one inflammatory sermon, Montmollin quoted Proverbs 15:8: \"The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight\"; this was interpreted by everyone to mean that Rousseau's taking communion was detested by the Lord. The ecclesiastical attacks inflamed the parishioners, who proceeded to pelt Rousseau with stones when he would go out for walks. Around midnight of 6\u20137 September 1765, stones were thrown at the house Rousseau was staying in, and some glass windows were shattered. When a local official, Martinet, arrived at Rousseau's residence he saw so many stones on the balcony that he exclaimed \"My God, it's a quarry!\" At this point, Rousseau's friends in M\u00f4tiers advised him to leave the town.", "Meanwhile, James Boswell, then in Paris, offered to escort Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to Rousseau.

Hume foresaw what was going to happen: \"I dread some event fatal to our friend's honor.\" Boswell and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se were together for more than a week, and as per notes in Boswell's diary they consummated the relationship, having intercourse several times.

In 1774, Samuel Johnson published The Patriot, a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, \"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.\" James Boswell, who reported this comment in his Life of Johnson, does not provide context for the quote, and it has therefore been argued that Johnson was in fact attacking the false use of the term \"patriotism\" by contemporaries such as John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (the patriot-minister) and his supporters; Johnson spoke elsewhere in favor of what he considered \"true\" patriotism. However, there is no direct evidence to contradict the widely held belief that Johnson's famous remark was a criticism of patriotism itself."]}, {"page": "Pale Fire", "response": ["* Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, Boswell's Life of Johnson and Hodge"]}, {"page": "Republicanism", "response": ["The Corsican Republic lasted for fifteen years, from 1755 to 1769, eventually falling to a combination of Genoese and French forces and was incorporated as a province of the Kingdom of France. But the episode resonated across Europe as an early example of Enlightened constitutional republicanism, with many of the most prominent political commentators of the day recognising it to be an experiment in a new type of popular and democratic government. Its influence was particularly notable among the French Enlightenment philosophers: Rousseau's famous work On the Social Contract (1762: chapter 10, book II) declared, in its discussion on the conditions necessary for a functional popular sovereignty, that \"There is still one European country capable of making its own laws: the island of Corsica. valour and persistency with which that brave people has regained and defended its liberty well deserves that some wise man should teach it how to preserve what it has won. I have a feeling that some day that little island will astonish Europe.\"; indeed Rousseau volunteered to do precisely that, offering a draft constitution for Paoli'se use.\"Projet de constitution pour la Corse \", published in \u0152uvres et correspondance in\u00e9dites de J.J. Rousseau, (M.G. Streckeinsen-Moultou, ed.). Paris, 1861 Similarly, Voltaire affirmed in his Pr\u00e9cis du si\u00e8cle de Louis XV (1769: chapter LX) that \"Bravery may be found in many places, but such bravery only among free peoples\". But the influence of the Corsican Republic as an example of a sovereign people fighting for liberty and enshrining this constitutionally in the form of an Enlightened republic was even greater among the Radicals of Great Britain and North America,Michel Verg\u00e9-Franceschi, \"Pascal Paoli, un Corse des Lumi\u00e8res\", Cahiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, 72 | 2006, 97\u2013112. where it was popularised via An Account of Corsica, by the Scottish essayist James Boswell. The Corsican Republic went on to influence the American revolutionaries ten years later: the Sons of Liberty, initiators of the American Revolution, would declare Pascal Paoli to be a direct inspiration for their own struggle against despotism; the son of Ebenezer Mackintosh was named Pascal Paoli Mackintosh in his honour, and no fewer than five American counties are named Paoli for the same reason."]}, {"page": "Voltaire", "response": ["Early in 1759, Voltaire completed and published Candide, ou l'Optimisme (Candide, or Optimism). This satire on Leibniz's philosophy of optimistic determinism remains Voltaire's best-known work. He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life, frequently entertaining distinguished guests, such as James Boswell, Adam Smith, Giacomo Casanova, and Edward Gibbon. In 1764, he published one of his best-known philosophical works, the Dictionnaire philosophique, a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas, a few of which were originally written in Berlin."]}]}}
