Early on, they scored a worldwide hit with the song \"United We Stand\". By 1973 the concept had run its course and Hiller formed a definite four-member line-up consisting of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens. This version of the group went on to score many hits around the world in the mid to late 1970s including \"Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby\", \"Angelo\", \"Oh Boy (The Mood I'm In)\" and \"Figaro\". They achieved perhaps their biggest success in their native UK with three number one singles and four top twenty albums. The group under this line-up still continues, performing shows throughout Europe. Altogether, they have released 16 studio albums, with worldwide sales topping 15 million records.", "Sheriden was already known to Hiller as a songwriter and had a solo career. Lee had a solo single to his name and was a budding songwriter. Stevens had been classically trained, but had since adapted her vocals and was performing as a cabaret singer. The trio began recording together, but their first single, \"Rock Me Baby\", to be released at the end of 1972, was cancelled due to the release of the song by David Cassidy. Finally their first two singles \"Happy Ever After\" and \"Our World of Love\" were released in 1973. Neither single charted and soon after, another female vocalist was added to the line up, Sandra Stevens. Stevens (no relation to Nicky) had been performing as a big-band singer since a teenager in the late 1960s. She had sung with the Joe Loss big band and alongside Eve Graham (of The New Seekers) in club group, The Nocturnes.", "In 1983, the songwriting team of Hiller, Lee, and Upton entered a song for the A Song for Europe competition.

The group lost out to another male/female trio, Sweet Dreams, and ended up in fifth place. Despite its failure, Brotherhood of Man recorded the song and chose it as their next single. Released in the summer of 1983, alongside their new album, Lightning Flash, neither record made the UK Chart and this brought to an end their contract with EMI. \"When the Kissing Stops\" remains Brotherhood of Man's final single release.", "* Sandra Stevens (1973\u2013present)", "   bar:SStevens            text:\"Sandra Stevens\""]}, {"page": "Eve Graham", "response": ["Graham began her career during the 1960s as a band singer with the Cyclones in Scotland and later with the Cyril Stapleton Band, based in London England.

As a teenager, he had a great interest in music and after learning to play guitar he formed his first band. In the early 1970s, he came to the attention of songwriter and publisher Tony Hiller, while he was working as lead singer with the Johnny Howard Band. Hiller signed him up to his company, Tony Hiller Music initially as a writer.  On discovering that he could sing as well, he asked him to be part of the group he managed, Brotherhood of Man. The group had recently disbanded and Hiller was keen to put a new line-up together. Along with Lee Sheriden and Nicky Stevens and later Sandra Stevens, the new line-up was born. Lee had already released a solo single by this time, a song called \"Cry Jos\u00e9\", but it failed to gain much interest. Working alongside Hiller and Sheriden, he began composing new songs for the group during 1972. The following year they released their first single and the year after, their first hit. Lee quickly emerged as the lead singer of the group, taking the lead on many of their songs, including that first hit \"Lady\".", "Soon after she joined the group in late 1973, Sandra Stevens began a relationship with Lee, and they were living together by the time of their Eurovision win in 1976.
