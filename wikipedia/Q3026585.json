Three, Tom Deacon and John and David Samuel, were from Swansea RFC; with Nicholl taking the remaining position. Played at Stradey Park, the game was only decided by a goal conversion from Billy Bancroft, giving Wales the victory and Ireland the wooden spoon. From that match, Nicholl became a regular fixture in the Welsh pack. Of his 15 caps for Wales he only missed one international match over a 16-game run, taking in five Home Nations Championships. Most notably, Nicholls was part of the 1893 team which saw Wales not only win the Championship, but lift the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. The next year's tournament saw Nicholl play the first two matches against England and Scotland, but then miss the final game away to Ireland, his place taken by Neath's Fred Hutchinson. Nicholl played in all three matches of the 1895 Championship, but 1896 saw a shift in the selection tactics employed by the Welsh Rugby Union. After a humiliating defeat by England in the opening game of the 1896 Championship the selectors decided to discard many of the forward players who had served Wales over the past four seasons, including Triple Crown winners like Wallace Watts and Arthur Boucher, favouring a new type of player emerging from the South Wales coalfields. Dubbed the 'Rhondda forward', these players were selected from tough manual workers who could not only scrummage and jump, but could take and respond to a more physical game.

Despite the defeat, Evans was back for the only match of the 1897 Championship, in a tournament disrupted by Wales leaving the International Rugby Board due to The Gould Affair.

This meant that Daniel had twice as many caps as the entire seven other pack members combined. Despite the inexperience of the Welsh pack, Wales were victorious over the Irish, winning 11-3.

Wales won the game in style, but it would be the only international the team would play that year, as an argument broke out between the Home Unions surrounding professionalism, now known as the Gould Affair. The next season, with Arthur Gould now forced into retirement, Wales were readmitted into the Championship. The only two members of the 1897 pack to return for the 1898 Championship were Cornish and Hellings.

The Thursday after the match, Nicholls arrived back in Britain and was immediately selected for the Welsh team to face Scotland. Despite a victory and some good reviews, Rees lost his place to Nicholls, despite Nicholls having not played a competitive game since the previous August.
