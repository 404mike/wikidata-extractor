He played two more matches in 1925 and did not return to Derbyshire until the 1932 season. He was primarily a club cricketer and played mostly for The Friars and other club sides. He played for Derbyshire only in the month of August, during school holidays, between 1932 and 1935. His best score was 64 against Warwickshire in the 1933 season.\nAfter the Second World War in the 1947 season, Blaxland reappeared for Derbyshire in his final first-class match, against the South Africans, when he led the side and kept wicket.

He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and bowled 11 overs in the first-class game without taking a wicket. He was described as \"a fine club cricketer who hit hard and often, hooking anything short of a length with great power. As a bowler he was tireless, and always alert and sharp in the field.\"Blaxland retired from Repton in 1958 and took holy orders. He became rector of Tansley and then vicar of Doveridge.Blaxland died at Temple Ewell, Kent, at the age of 78. He is the great-uncle of former Kent and Derbyshire player James Graham-Brown, who writes plays under the nom de guerre \"Dougie Blaxland\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donald Carr", "response": ["Carr was the son of John Carr, an officer of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, who was serving with the British Army of the Rhine in Germany.

Already an above average boy cricketer, he developed into one of the best young all-rounders under the coaching of Lionel Blaxland and Garnet Lee.
