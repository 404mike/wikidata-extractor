He was an illegitimate son of a textile manufacturer and inherited a substantial estate, which he spent almost entirely on vellum manuscripts and, when out of funds, borrowed heavily to buy manuscripts, thereby putting his family deep into debt. Phillipps recorded in an early catalogue that his collection was instigated by reading various accounts of the destruction of valuable manuscripts. Such was his devotion that he acquired some 40,000 printed books and 60,000 manuscripts, arguably the largest collection a single individual has created, and coined the term \"vello-maniac\" to describe his obsession, which is more commonly termed bibliomania.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William H.

Prescott had started searching for sources as early as 1842, but a number of difficulties confronted him in his study of Philip II.  The principal archives of historical material were held in Simancas, but neither Lembke (who had collected materials for the Conquest of Mexico) nor Middleton were able to gain access to them.Ticknor, 1864, p. 285 They had been informed that the library was so disordered as to make productive research impossible, even if access had been gained. However, Lembke, who as a diplomat had been expelled from Spain, made the acquaintance of two wealthy Parisian scholars, Mignet and Ternaux-Compans, who offered him access to their manuscript collections.Ticknor, 1864, p. 286 Furthermore, de Gayangos assisted greatly by locating important documents in the British Museum and in the collection of the bibliomaniac Thomas Phillipps, who owned around 60,000\u00a0manuscripts. He also borrowed several manuscripts from the archives in Brussels, having received letters from the respected Belgian diplomat Sylvain Van de Weyer in London. de Gayangos became Professor of Arabic literature at the Complutense University of Madrid in late 1842, and subsequently lent Prescott rare books and manuscripts from the university library.Ticknor, 1864, p. 288 By the summer of 1848, Prescott had over 300 works on the subject at his disposal, but he continued to have serious problems with his eyesight; an examination by an oculist confirmed that there was untreatable damage to his retina.Ticknor, 1864, p. 281 Prescott had been commissioned by the Massachusetts Historical Society to write a biography of the scholar John Pickering in 1848, which he wrote for publication later in that year.Ticknor, 1864, p. 283 Prescott was invited to write a history of the Mexican\u2013American War, but declined, as he was uninterested in writing on contemporary events.Ticknor, 1864, p. 291"]}, {"page": "1872 in literature", "response": ["*February 6 \u2013 Sir Thomas Phillipps, English book collector (born 1792)"]}, {"page": "1792 in literature", "response": ["*July 2 \u2013 Thomas Phillipps, English book collector (died 1872)"]}, {"page": "James Halliwell-Phillipps", "response": ["In 1841, while at Cambridge, Halliwell dedicated his book Reliquae Antiquae to Sir Thomas Phillipps, the noted bibliomaniac.
