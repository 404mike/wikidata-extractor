For a period up until his death he was the chairman of the British Student Christian Movement.  He was one of A. J. Ayer's tutors at Oxford, but their relationship is remembered more as a source of strained feelings than of scholarly fellowship. His disparate works on political science and various doctrines of Christianity (especially the doctrine of creation) have influenced philosophers such as George Grant, who had, when writing his doctoral thesis, in fact visited with Foster in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Relationship between religion and science", "response": ["Historian and professor of religion Eugene M.
