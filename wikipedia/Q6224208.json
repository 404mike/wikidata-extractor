He attended his first meeting on 19 February 1782 and quickly became one of The Club's most enthusiastic supporters and, as its treasurer, held the only permanent office associated with it. His motivation for wanting to join The Club was partly to see Johnson more often, but Johnson's health was deteriorating and no longer attended the club's dinners regularly. The first one he attended after Malone was accepted was on 2 April 1782, and in the period until Johnson's death on 13 December 1784, they saw each other at the club only five times; the last time on 22 June 1784, when Johnson \"was in obvious pain and had to drag himself to get there.\" Johnson was also too ill to visit Malone, but he appreciated company at his house at Bolt Court, and Malone visited frequently. He kept notes on their conversations that Boswell later included in his The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791), and the letter to Malone from John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington is the best account that survives of Johnson's last hours."]}, {"page": "Viscount Torrington", "response": ["*John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington (1743\u20131813)"]}, {"page": "Kamehameha II", "response": ["They arrived on May 17, 1824 in Portsmouth, and the next day moved into the Caledonian Hotel in London. Foreign Secretary George Canning appointed Frederick Gerald Byng (1784\u20131871) to supervise their visit. Byng was a Gentleman Usher, fifth son of John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington and friend of Beau Brummell, known more for his gaudy fashions than diplomacy. Their arrival was met by the local press with a mixture of curiosity and derision. They were not sure what to call the king, spelling his \"Liholiho\" name various ways such as \"Rheo Rhio\". Some made puns on the fact that Byng's nickname was \"Poodle\" and in Hawaiian \u02bb\u012blio \u02bb\u012blio would mean \"dog of dogs\" and that the British name of the kingdom was \"Sandwich Islands\". Byng made sure they would have appropriate attire for all their public appearances."]}, {"page": "Powis Castle", "response": ["Despite their 30-year exile, the Herberts continued developments at the castle and even to live there on an irregular basis, the Baroque water garden below the castle being completed at this time. Their fortunes were also materially improved by the discovery of a lucrative lead mine on their Welsh estates. The second Marquess, also William, was reinstated in 1722. On the death of his son, the third Marquess in 1748, the marquessate became extinct, while the castle and estates passed to a relative Henry Herbert (), of Oakly Park in Shropshire, who was made 1st Earl of Powis (of the second creation) by George II. Herbert married Barbara, the fifteen-year old granddaughter of the 2nd Marquess, in 1751. Their eldest son, George Herbert (1755\u20131801), died unmarried and the earldom of the second creation became extinct. Powis was much neglected during his tenure. John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington, a diarist and traveller who chronicled his journeys into Wales in the 1780s and 1790s, described the castle in 1784, \"In the gardens not even the fruit is attended to; the balustrades and terraces are falling down, and the horses graze on the parterres!!!\" The castle itself was in no better condition, a visitor in 1774 describing it as \"in Neglect and Ruin\". Nonetheless, the potential of the site was recognised. George Lyttelton, the politician, poet and essayist, recorded his impressions in 1756, \"About \u00a33,000 laid out upon Powis Castle would make it the most august place in the Kingdom.\""]}, {"page": "John Byng (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington (1743\u20131813), British peer and diarist"]}, {"page": "George Byng, 3rd Viscount Torrington", "response": ["* John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington (1743\u20131813)"]}, {"page": "Cannons (house)", "response": ["The estate itself was purchased by the cabinet maker William Hallett who in 1760 built a large villa on the site which today houses the North London Collegiate School, where part of the original temple can still be seen, and is known by the modern spelling, Canons.
