Bertran de Born and Peirol mention Conrad in songs composed at the time of the Third Crusade (see external links below). He was seen as a heroic figure, the noble defender of Tyre \u2014 the \"Marqu\u00e9s valens e pros\" (\"the valiant and worthy Marquis\") as Peirol called him. In Carmina Burana 50: Heu, voce flebili cogor enarrare, he is described as \"marchio clarissimus, vere palatinus\" (\"the most famous Marquis, truly a paladin\"). However, subsequently, the long-term prejudice of popular English-language writing towards Richard I and his \"Lionheart\" myth has adversely affected portrayals of Conrad in English-language fiction and film. Because Richard (and his chroniclers) opposed his claim to the throne, he is generally depicted negatively, even when Richard himself is treated with some scepticism. A rare exception to this is the epic poem C\u0153ur de Lion (1822), by Eleanor Anne Porden, in which he is depicted as a tragic Byronic hero."]}, {"page": "John Franklin", "response": ["In 1823, after returning to England, Franklin married the poet Eleanor Anne Porden.
