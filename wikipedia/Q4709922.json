He was also in contact with Russian railway engineer Yury Lomonosov and lectured to biochemist Albert Chibnall. Despite mentoring some of the best engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time.  He once told a new intake class: \"Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort\". Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming \"cramped by premature specialisation\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Chibnall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Chibnall"]}, {"page": "AC Chibnall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Chibnall"]}, {"page": "Marjorie Chibnall", "response": ["In 1947, she married the biochemist and amateur medieval historian Albert Chibnall, who died in 1988.
