Despite having a new home, finances proved to be a problem for the club. Burns departed for Gravesend & Northfleet in December 1982 to be replaced by John Keirs, who took the club to fourth place in the 1983\u201384 season, promotion only denied to the Angels on the final day of the season. Phil Emblen took over the reins in July 1985 and led the club to another Southern League Semi Final appearance in 1987, but his departure along with several key players at the end of the 1987\u201388 season led to a slump in the 40th anniversary season.", "The Angels regrouped for the 1989\u201390 season with former player and manager Tony Burns returning to manage the club for a second time. Tonbridge finished in a worthy third place, not enough for a quick return to Southern League football, but silverware was forthcoming in the form of the Kent League Cup. Another former manager returned for the 1990\u201391 season, Phil Emblen, and he sparked a revival in the club's fortunes. Emblen patiently built a winning team and after two fourth-placed finishes, money-spinning Cup runs and another Kent League Cup win, the title finally arrived at Longmead in the 1992\u201393 season. And so, after a few seasons away, Tonbridge returned to the league which they had graced for so many years."]}, {"page": "Jim Furnell", "response": ["Furnell immediately slotted into the Arsenal first team, making his debut the day after he signed, on 23 November 1963 against Blackpool; the match finished 5\u20133 to Arsenal. Furnell went on to become the long-term successor to Jack Kelsey, playing as Arsenal's No. 1 for the next five seasons (aside from 1964-65, when he shared the spot with Tony Burns). Under manager Billy Wright, however, Arsenal struggled to make an impact in either the League or the Cups."]}, {"page": "Burns (surname)", "response": ["*Tony Burns (born 1944), English footballer"]}]}}
