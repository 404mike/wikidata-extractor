This is where the original tower stood before the rebuilding of the early 19th-century. The chapel altar is 17th-century, while the figures on the reredos are (from left to right): St Michael (for Great Torrington), St Giles (for Little Torrington), St Mary the Virgin, St James, St Mary Magdalene (for Taddiport), and St Gabriel (for St Gabriel's Mission in the town, which no longer exists). The oil painting above the altar is a copy of Caravaggio's 'Ecce Homo'. The icon to the left of the altar is a version of Our Lady of Cz\u0119stochowa, the original being in Poland. It hangs here as a result of a court case which made legal history. The Chancellor of the Diocese, David Calcutt, refused permission for its installation but in 1984 the parish appealed to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved, which had never sat before, and the Chancellor's decision was reversed. The window in the chapel is a memorial to the apothecary and inventor Thomas Fowler. The border shows two of his inventions: the thermosiphon (the founder of the central heating systems) and a calculating machine, a forerunner of the modern computer, and which was admired by his contemporary Charles Babbage."]}]}}
