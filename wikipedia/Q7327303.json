His early career was marked by his participation in a number of important battles during the American war, during the French Revolutionary Wars he spent an unremarkable period of time in the Caribbean, but during the Napoleonic Wars he was again prominent, participating heavily in a number of important engagements. In 1812 Lee was promoted to rear-admiral and was unable to get an appointment, his future as a serving officer in doubt. Although he never again served in an active capacity, he continued to receive promotions and rewards for his lengthy service, both from the British and Portuguese royal families. He died at his home in Walmer, Kent in 1837 at the age of 72 as a full admiral.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Action of 25 September 1806", "response": ["As soon as Soleil realised that he had been spotted he gave orders for his ships to sail to the southwest as fast as possible, hoping to outdistance the British squadron. However his convoy were all heavily laden and were therefore slower than they would normally be, while the heavy swell and strong winds favoured the large ships of the line. The chase continued throughout the night, until by 04:00 Monarch was clearly gaining on the convoy, with Centaur  behind. At 05:00, Captain Richard Lee was close enough to fire his bow-chasers, small guns situated at the front of his ship, at the rearmost French frigate, the Armide. Captain Jean-Jacques-Jude Langlois returned the fire with his stern-chasers and the French ships raised the Tricolour in anticipation of battle.James, p. 263 Recognising that he was facing an overwhelming British force, Soleil split his ships, sending Th\u00e9tis and the corvettes Lynx and Sylphe southwards and Infatigable to the north. This had limited success in achieving the desired effect of dividing the pursuit, with Captain William Lukin taking HMS Mars out of the British line in pursuit of Infatigable while the slow HMS Windsor Castle was sent after the three south bound ships, but the main body of the Royal Navy squadron remained on course.", "| align= left  |Captain Richard Lee"]}, {"page": "Richard Lee", "response": ["Richard Lee may refer to:", "*Sir Richard Lee (engineer) (1513\u20131575), military engineer and MP for Hertfordshire", "*Richard Lee (MP for Much Wenlock) (?1501\u20131557 or later), MP for Much Wenlock", "*Richard Lee (died 1608), English politician and Ambassador to Russia", "*Richard Lee (MP for Rochester), English politician, MP for Rochester", "*Sir Richard Lee, 2nd Baronet (c. 1600\u20131660), English politician ", "*Col.

Giving chase, conditions suited Hood's larger ships and by 04:00 Soleil recognised that he would be caught by the advancing British and detached three ships southwards and one to the north, retaining three others to delay the approaching British squadron, which had become separated during the pursuit.Woodman, p. 227 Engaging the lead ship,  under Captain Richard Lee, Soleil ordered his frigates to target her rigging in the hope of slowing Monarch's advance and escaping. Monarch was damaged in the battle, but remained in contact with the French long enough that Hood's flagship HMS Centaur and later HMS Mars could come up and join the engagement. In all four of the French frigates were captured, including the vessel sent north, which was caught by Mars. British casualties were nine killed and 29 wounded, the latter including Hood, who lost an arm."]}, {"page": "List of Royal Navy admirals (1707\u2013current)", "response": ["| Sir Richard Lee KCB"]}]}}
