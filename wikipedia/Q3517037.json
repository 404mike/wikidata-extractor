Based on Ted Lewis' 1970 novel Jack's Return Home, the film follows the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), a London gangster who returns to his hometown in North East England to learn about his brother's supposedly accidental death. Suspecting foul play, and with vengeance on his mind, he investigates and interrogates, regaining a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element.", "After searching many publishers for material to adapt into a film, Klinger purchased the rights to Ted Lewis' novel Jack's Return Home. Andrew Spicer has written that \"he [Klinger] sensed its potential to imbue the British crime thriller with the realism and violence of its American counterparts\".", "Klinger contacted Hodges on 27 January 1970 with a copy of Jack's Return Home and contracted him to write and direct the film, paying him a flat fee of \u00a37,000 for his services. Hodges' original working title for the film was Carter's The Name. Steve Chibnall writes: \"his treatment retained the essential structure of Lewis' novel with its strong narrative drive, but introduced some minor changes to characterisation and more fundamental alterations to narratology\". As Ted Lewis had not specified where his novel was set, Hodges felt free to relocate the story to a place he was familiar with, considering Grimsby, Lowestoft, Hull and North Shields before deciding on Newcastle Upon Tyne. Hodges said he was influenced in his writing by the works of Raymond Chandler and Hollywood B-movies such as Kiss Me Deadly, because they showed \"how to use the crime story as an autopsy on society's ills\". He did not, however, employ a traditional noir technique of using a voiceover to expose the character's inner feelings. He also dispensed with flashbacks to Carter's youth featured in the novel which explored his relationship with his brother Frank, streamlining the plot to a linear narrative spanning a single weekend. As Chibnall writes ", "Warner Bros., which holds the rights to the pre-1986 MGM library, produced a remake of Get Carter in 2000 under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone as Jack Carter. As with Hit Man, the film credited Ted Lewis' Jack's Return Home as its source, not Hodges' film, and again it contains scenes that are directly borrowed from the original, such as the opening train ride. Michael Caine appears as Cliff Brumby in what Elvis Mitchell described as \"a role that will increase regard for the original\", speculating that \"maybe that was his intention\". Mickey Rourke plays the villain Cyrus Paice. The remake was compared unfavourably to the original by the majority of reviewers. The consensus opinion of critics on Rotten Tomatoes was that it was \"a remake that doesn't approach the standard of the original, Get Carter will likely leave viewers confused and unsatisfied. Also, reviews are mixed concerning Stallone's acting\". It was so badly received on its US release that Warner Bros. decided not to give it a UK theatrical release, anticipating the film would be savaged by British critics and fans. Elvis Mitchell in The New York Times wrote \"it's so minimally plotted that not only does it lack subtext or context, but it also may be the world's first movie without even a text\". Mike Hodges said in 2003 he had still not seen the remake, but was informed by a friend that it was \"unspeakable\". His son brought him a DVD of the film back from Hong Kong and he tried to watch it, but the region format was incompatible \"so we put it in the dustbin\". The film was voted the worst remake of all time in 2004 by users of British DVD rental website ScreenSelect (precursor of Lovefilm)."]}, {"page": "1982 in literature", "response": ["** Ted Lewis, English crime novelist (born 1940)"]}, {"page": "1940 in literature", "response": ["*January 15 \u2013 Ted Lewis, English novelist (died 1982)"]}, {"page": "List of crime writers", "response": ["* Ted Lewis (1940\u20131982, E)"]}, {"page": "Barton-upon-Humber", "response": ["Since 1981, there has been a local history museum based in Baysgarth House, within Baysgarth Park.
