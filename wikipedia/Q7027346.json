He is a left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler who is currently without a club.\nWhile studying at King Edward VI Aston in Birmingham James made his debut for the Warwickshire Second XI in September 2004, with whom he played for three seasons and competed in the 2005 Second XI Trophy. James then joined the Warwickshire First XI and represented the county in the 2006 C&G Trophy, though Warwickshire finished second to last in the table that season and thus did not progress to the second round of the competition.\nDuring the Spring of 2006, James also represented Staffordshire in the MCCA Trophy.\nTowards the end of the 2009 Cricket season James was taken on trial by Glamorgan. After successful performances in the Pro40 league James was signed by the Welsh county.\nIn 2011, James signed a new two-year contract with Glamorgan, taking him up to the end of the 2013 season.In the 2013 season, James only appeared for Glamorgan in the Twenty 20 playing 8 out of Glamorgan's 10 games in total.
