It also likened Inoue Sato to Jar Jar Binks. Los Angeles Times said, \"Brown's narrative moves rapidly, except for those clunky moments when people sound like encyclopedias.\" Newsweek called the book \"contrived\", saying that to get through The Lost Symbol, just like The Da Vinci Code, it was necessary to swallow a lot of coincidences, but the book was still a page-turner, and that Brown \"is a maze maker who builds a puzzle and then walks you through it. His genius lies in uncovering odd facts and suppressed history, stirring them together into a complicated stew and then saying, what if?\" The National Post's review called it a \"heavy-handed, clumsy thriller\" and that the character of the villain (Mal'akh) \"bears an uncomfortably close similarity\" to the Francis Dolarhyde character in Thomas Harris' 1981 novel Red Dragon. The Daily Telegraph said the novel was \"not quite the literary train-wreck expected.\" TIME said the plot was fun, if bruising, but \"It would be irresponsible not to point out that the general feel, if not all the specifics, of Brown's cultural history is entirely correct. He loves showing us places where our carefully tended cultural boundaries \u2014 between Christian and pagan, sacred and secular, ancient and modern \u2014 are actually extraordinarily messy.\" Novelist William Sutcliffe's review in the Financial Times panned the book as \"a novel that asks nothing of the reader, and gives the reader nothing back\", adding that it \"is filled with clich\u00e9, bombast, undigested research and pseudo-intellectual codswallop\".

He later made his West End theatre debut as Mark, the protagonist in William Sutcliffe's coming-of-age play New Boy; the production premiered at Trafalgar Studios and had record-breaking ticket sales, which was mostly attributed to Hoult's popularity among viewers of Skins. The play was staged for a week in March 2009 because Hoult had committed to a part in the fantasy-adventure film Clash of the Titans (2010), filming for which was scheduled for mid-2010. Hoult's performance as Mark, a \"ferociously bright and articulate but sexually confused sixth-former\" received mixed responses from critics. Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph wrote that his performance was persuasive, but Lyn Gardner of The Guardian found him average and highlighted his inability to bring out the \"unresolved sexual tension beneath [the] banter\".
