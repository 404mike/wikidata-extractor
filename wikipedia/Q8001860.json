William Clarke established Trent Bridge as a cricket venue adjacent to the public house he ran. It was Clarke's successor as Nottinghamshire captain, George Parr, who first captained a united England touring team in 1859.  The club elected its first president, Sir Henry Bromley, in 1869. Early professional greats such as Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury ensured that Notts were a force in the period before 1900.

Keeton and other young batsmen such as Charles Harris and George Gunn junior were given few first-team opportunities, and Keeton played in just five games in 1928 and two in the Championship-winning season of 1929 \u2013 one of those two was against Oxford University \u2013 and none at all in both 1927 and 1930."]}, {"page": "Richard Hughes (cricketer)", "response": ["Hughes was born in Watford, Hertfordshire in September 1926 and was educated at Watford Grammar School for Boys.
