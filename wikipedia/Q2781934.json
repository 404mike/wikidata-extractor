Zahoor sustained the policy of editorial independence, with limited exceptions. After the newspaper's editors endorsed Yulia Tymoshenko over Viktor Yanukovych for president in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, the publisher issued a policy to forbid editorial endorsements of any political candidate or political party, saying the newspaper should remain non-partisan even on its opinion pages. Zahoor relaxed the policy during the May 25, 2014 presidential election, when he and his wife, singer-actress Kamaliya, came out publicly in strong support of billionaire Ukrainian businessman Petro Poroshenko's election as president. While the newspaper was free to endorse any candidate for the election, its editorial board made no endorsement in the contest that Poroshenko easily won."]}, {"page": "Wild child", "response": ["*\"Wild Child\", by Kamaliya, 2017"]}, {"page": "Aphrodite (disambiguation)", "response": ["*\"Aphrodite\", a song by Kamaliya"]}, {"page": "Mike Rizzo", "response": ["*Kamaliya \u2013 Arrhythmia"]}, {"page": "Alexandros Panayi", "response": ["Alex currently lives in Nicosia, Cyprus where he directs his company \"Silver Spotlight Productions LTD\" and also coaches and performs with Greece's leading artists including Peggy Zina Kostas Martakis and Anna Vissi.
