The prior jester of record, Muckle John, vacated the position shortly after his employer, King Charles I of England, was beheaded in 1649.\nRoder was appointed by English Heritage after winning a jesting competition. Subsequently, the Guild of Jesters complained through their spokesman, Jonathan the Jester, that English Heritage should not be allowed to use the title of State Jester.  Several guild members also wrote to their MPs. After the question was raised in Parliament, Kester's title was amended to \"English Heritage Jester\".Nigel Roder is currently working throughout the United Kingdom as an entertainer both in his jester role and as a teacher of circus skills workshops. He is one of the founders and regular trainers of the voluntary youth circus Concrete Circus (founded 2009).Nigel has been referenced by two BBC quizzes.
