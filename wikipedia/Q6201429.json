The Stoke manager Bob McGrory promised him a contract after Sproson finished his National service, but after brother Jess introduced him to Port Vale manager Gordon Hodgson, he signed with the Vale for \u00a33 a week while he served his National service. In July 1949 Sproson's time with the Royal Air Force had finished and he signed with Port Vale as a professional. However he had to wait until 11 November 1950 for his debut, in a 1\u20131 draw with Gillingham at Priestfield.
