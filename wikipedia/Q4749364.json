It is doubtful, indeed, whether since the early plays of Mr. Albery any work of the same class has obtained an equally favourable reception. Some farcical comedies have met with no less cordial welcome. From a farcical comedy, however, to a genuine comedy, such as The Silver Shield claims to be, is a long step. Mr. Grundy's dialogue is not only amusing\u2014it has the immeasurably higher quality of appropriateness; his characters are true to themselves, and are not mere victims of circumstance; his mirth has an underlying suggestion of pathos; and his work has literary quality. In these respects it stands above most successful effort of recent days. Now and then Mr. Grundy stoops to the Byronic style of workmanship, and introduces a joke which is inconsistent and improbable. When, for instance, concerning a half finished dinner which the guests hurriedly leave, one of the characters says, \"It can wait,\" Mr. Grundy unworthily makes another add, \"The servants could not.\" Offences of this kind are few, and in one or two passages the language is genuinely happy and worthy to be remembered. The plot is open to objection. It is thin, and seems at one point to be going to pieces. That it escapes from so doing is due to highly ingenious treatment, the result of which is that the end is brilliant. A suspicion of artifice is, however, suggested. Add to this that the plot deals with details of the behind-scenes life of the theatre, which, whatever their success with the exceptional audiences attracted to a first representation, are not calculated to appeal to a more promiscuous public, and the chief elements of weakness are indicated. These will probably be surmounted by the animal spirits of the play, the ingenuity of its complications, and the cleverness of the characterization. The fear whether the whole is not, like a clever toy, too brittle, seems dispelled by the fact that the characters are at once amusing and natural. Mr. Grundy owes much to his exponents. It is difficult to fancy acting brighter or more effective than that of Miss Amy Roselle and Mr. Groves, or more touching than that of Mies Kate Eorke, who at one point attained a hold over the audience such as a girl of her age has rarely achieved. Mr. Beauchamp, Mr. Rutland Barrington, Mr. Dacre, Mr. Herbert, and Mrs. Leigh Murray were also good, and the performance as a whole had a commendable ensemble.\"The Athenaeum: Literature, Science, the Fine Arts, Music, and the Drama, Part 1; January\u2013June, 1885; p. 673 - Google Free Books - U.K. Copyright Law in place at the time of publication: Typographical arrangement of published editions, magazines, periodicals, etc. 25 years from the end of the calendar year in which the work was first published.", "*Alma Blake: Amy Roselle *Rosina Vokes"]}, {"page": "Rudolph Lewis (bass-baritone)", "response": ["During this period Lewis played occasional benefit and concert dates, often together with other Savoyards, singing Mr Molehill in Won By a Trick at the Gaiety Theatre for Meyer Lutz's benefit in 1885 and Sparafucile in Rigoletto in 1886.
