The album was released on June 1, 2006, on their record label Organized Nature. The album contains the singles \"Tracking Treasure Down\" which features Molly Bancroft and \"Dangerous Power\" which features Jan Burton.", "The album features two lead vocalists, Molly Bancroft and Jan Burton, as well as backup vocals from Dave, Josh, Gabriel's wife, Kristy; and their little son, Rowan. The vocals also set in onslaught; this can make a background vocal chopped, reversed, reverbed, delayed, phased and distorted. The sound is made by Gabriel and Dresden with a Studio Projects tube microphone through a Grace 101 preamp into a Summit Audio TLA-50 compressor as well as in a MOTU 828mkII interface. Some vocal songs like \"Let Go\" featuring Molly Bancroft and \"Enemy\" with Burton prove how Gabriel and Dresden's methodology of creating an obvious lead vocal into separated, secondary layers. The background vocals provide a midpoint between high and low due to the sibilance; the highest part of the voice is the thing that gives one intelligibility, the high end is what makes the words clear since there is nothing clearer than one voice; everything else is blurrier once it is added. A song that meets these criteria is \"Tracking Treasure Down\", which features one clear voice and the additional background vocals at a certain high end pulled down so high frequencies don't interfere with the lead voice. By taking away the high end it would become muddier, which is something Dave evaded; he took all high-end voices away, except for one, which peaks through and creates a definite position of all minor vocals. The layer comes from the pitch part of the voice and not the sibilance, which eliminates most high end and low end voices making it sound in layers. Leaving several vocals with all the high end in position overloads the sound for the ears. By taking all ends off it hurts the ears; in this situation they used a shelf, so it would pull 5 dB less from 5,600 Hz, making it sound like if the vocals lose edge, as if it were falling behind, which does not remove the bass. Dresden uses a high-pass filter at 1,100\u00a0Hz which lies in-between. Rocktronica singer and songwriter Jes Brieden helped with the writing of lyrics for songs like \"Enemy\" and \"Dangerous Power\". Tracks \"Enemy\" and \"Dangerous Power\" are adaptations from the track \"Imagination\" by the duo's group Motorcycle with Jes Brieden. \"Dust in the Wind\" is a cover of the band Kansas; alternatively the duo wanted to cover \"Black Hole Sun\" by Soundgarden but they decided for \"Dust in the Wind\" since Dave felt it was a tribute to 9/11.", "* Backing vocals - Jan Burton", "* Lead vocals - Jan Burton", "* Written by - Dave Dresden, Josh Gabriel, Jan Burton and Jes Brieden", "* Backing vocals - Jan Burton", "* Lead vocals - Jan Burton", "* Written by - Dave Dresden, Josh Gabriel and Jan Burton", "* Lead vocals - Jan Burton", "* Lead vocals - Jan Burton", "* Written by - Dave Dresden, Josh Gabriel, Jan Burton and Jes Brieden"]}, {"page": "Toolroom Knights, Vol. 2", "response": ["#Gabriel & Dresden Feat.
