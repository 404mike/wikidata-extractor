In 1982, he joined Carlisle United on a free transfer, then in 1985 joined Hartlepool United, again on a free transfer. An eye injury forced him to retire as a professional player in December 1988, but he continued playing with Ferryhill Athletic. He later became assistant manager at Gretna, and then a coach at Newcastle Blue Star. He has since managed several clubs, including Coundon, Crook Town, Bishop Auckland, Willington, West Auckland Town and Blyth Spartans.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["|1980|| Alan Shoulder"]}, {"page": "Gateshead F.C.", "response": ["|1998||Alan Shoulder, Gary Robson (co-caretakers)"]}, {"page": "Bill McGarry", "response": ["He headed abroad and replaced Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s as coach of the Saudi Arabian national team, but soon returned to England.

He gave Kenny Wharton his first professional contract, who would go on to play for the club for eleven years. He also signed Peter Withe, Alan Shoulder, and Bobby Shinton. He could not stop the \"Magpies\" suffering relegation out of the First Division in the 1977\u201378 season. He could only take United to two mid-table finishes in the Second Division in 1978\u201379 and 1979\u201380, before he was fired just weeks into the 1980\u201381 season after his team were knocked out of the League Cup by Third Division club Bury.
