After just one first-team appearance for Palace, he signed for Norwich City, but soon found himself again on loan at Bournemouth, for whom he signed a permanent contract in 2010. A season later, he joined Charlton Athletic, where he spent four years of regular first-team football. After a brief spell with Sheffield Wednesday, he returned to Bournemouth, by then in the Premier League, in January 2016, but did not play. He signed on loan at Birmingham City the following August, but was seriously injured in his second match and retired from football in May 2018.\nWiggins has represented Wales in international football from under-17 to under-21 level.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hayes, Hillingdon", "response": ["* Welsh international footballer Rhoys Wiggins (1987-) grew up in Hayes."]}, {"page": "Chris Powell", "response": ["Powell signed 19 new players in summer 2011, including midfielders Danny Green, Danny Hollands, Dale Stephens, defenders Matt Taylor, Rhoys Wiggins and goalkeeper Ben Hamer.

The Birmingham Mail thought he needed to be more assertive when dealing with crosses, and the player himself, while admitting he had had \"a few shaky games\", felt more settled than he had in the past and was enjoying playing regularly. Going into the 2016\u201317 campaign, Rowett was actively seeking to bring in another left back as competition: when Rhoys Wiggins arrived on loan from AFC Bournemouth, BBC WM's Richard Wilford wrote that he became \"the first serious challenger to Jonathan Grounds at left-back in two years.\" Grounds retained his place for some weeks as the team went seven matches unbeaten and provided the assist for Che Adams's equalising goal away to Preston North End, but a fifth booking of the season in a defeat at Burton Albion earned him a one-match suspension and gave Wiggins his opportunity. He started the local derby against Aston Villa, produced what Rowett dubbed an \"absolutely brilliant\" performance until in stoppage time, he suffered a knee injury that ended his season."]}, {"page": "2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 10", "response": ["*: Mark Bradley, Shaun MacDonald, Rhoys Wiggins, Mike Williams, Rhys Williams"]}, {"page": "Mellow Lane School", "response": ["* Rhoys Wiggins (born 1987) \u2014 Welsh international footballer"]}, {"page": "Mario Marinic\u0103", "response": ["During 2002\u20132003, he became a development coach at the Crystal Palace FC Academy.
