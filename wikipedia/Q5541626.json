The second half saw the \"Throstles\" switch to a long ball game, and on 62 minutes Cheadle was bustled off the ball and could only watch the equaliser cross the line. Eight minutes later captain Cheadle was judged to have fouled George Lee just inside the penalty box, though the Port Vale players maintained that the challenge took place well outside of the box, and that Lee also handled the ball. Former \"Valiant\" star Ronnie Allen converted the resulting penalty. Later in the match Leake had an equalising goal disallowed for offside, and Vale therefore failed to be the first third-tier club to reach an FA Cup Final."]}, {"page": "Acomb F.C.", "response": ["They left the Yorkshire League after just three years but remained active and produced many players of repute, including George Lee, who signed for York City in 1936 and went on to win the FA Cup with West Bromwich Albion in 1954.Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer, Friday 5 June 1936"]}]}}
