He played for Kent's Second XI between 1903 and 1906 and played club cricket for Wateringbury Cricket Club, which he captained, The Mote and for MCC. He made his only Kent First XI appearance in 1905 against Oxford University.Leney's father Augustus had established the Phoenix Brewery at Wateringbury in 1843 and Frederick, the eldest son, went into the family business after leaving school, becoming a Director by 1911. At the outbreak of World War I he joined the British Red Cross as a Red Cross Searcher. He served with the organisation in France and Egypt until December 1916 when he was discharged and returned to run the brewery, his father having died in a hunting accident the previous year.Leney died suddenly at the Railway Hotel in Galway in July 1921 aged 44. His uncle, Herbert, played four first-class matches for Kent. The family business, which had been renamed Frederick Leney & Sons in 1896, was taken over by Whitbread in 1927 and then by Fremlin's Brewery in the 1960s. It operated until 1981, although the site has since been used as a distribution depot for Whitbread.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of ambulance drivers during World War I", "response": ["*Frederick Leney \u2013 British Red Cross Searcher, 1914\u20131916"]}, {"page": "Wateringbury", "response": ["*Frederick Leney (1876\u20131921), cricketer, was born in Wateringbury."]}, {"page": "Herbert Leney", "response": ["Leney was born at Wateringbury near Maidstone in Kent in 1850.Herbert Leney, CricInfo.

After World War I, it was necessary to revisit company policy, so a private limited company, Fremlin Bros Ltd was formed in 1920. The company reverted to the pub trade, buying up smaller breweries around Kent, and the Harris Browne Brewery in Barnet and Adams Brewery in Halstead, Essex. Fremlin's had become Kent's largest brewery by the mid-20th century, having acquired around 800 pubs and other licensed premises. In 1949, the company bought out George Beer & Rigden in Faversham, along with its production plant. It closed in 1954, with all brewing taking place in Maidstone, but reopened in 1961 to meet demand. In 1960, Fremlin's bought Frederick Leney & Sons of Wateringbury, taking over their brewery and 189 pubs."]}]}}
