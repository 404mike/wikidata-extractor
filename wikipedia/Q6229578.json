In 1852, he became a Christian and started to study English and business. In 1857, he was employed as a manager in the Elles & Co. (), which engaged in trading foreign goods and Chinese tea owned by English businessmen in Xiamen. In 1867, Li transferred to the Dent & Co., which was also owned by English businessmen, where he helped the owner, John Dodd, develop the tea industry in northern Taiwan. Because of his excellent managing skills, tea became the most important export item in that area. After that, Li transferred to Boyd & Co.() as a manager.
