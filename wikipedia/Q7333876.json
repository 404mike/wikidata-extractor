Owen's brother was brought in to play guitar alongside Leacock, with Shane Davey on the drums. Davey later moved to America and Leacock filled in as a temporary drummer but was not replaced since. The band had straight away begun gigging and also toured as main support to Fighting With Wire. Despite only being together for a few months, the band were named no.6 in Across the Line's top 10 local acts of 2007. In between touring and gigs the band were constantly recording demos and also releasing studio EPs. A demo in the summer of 2008 landed them a spot on the BBC Introducing Stage at that year's Reading & Leeds festival. Their first single, \"Rebel Get By,\" was released in November 2008 and their second single, \"Something Sometime,\" became Zane Lowe's \"Hottest Record in the World\". In 2009 the band signed to Infectious Records. NME included them as one of \"the ten hopes for the near future.\" Since then they have been part of the BBC Introducing line-up at the Electric Proms in October 2008. The band started to receive plays from Zane Lowe, Steve Lamacq, Colin Murray, Huw Stephens, John Kennedy, Rigsy on Across The Line, Jenny Huston and Sara Cox and was playlisted at Xfm.
