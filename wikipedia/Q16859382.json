He was the harper of the Earl of Antrim. Donnchadh \u00d3 hAmhsaigh, known in English as Denis Hempson also a harper, was a great admirer of Cornelius Lyons and played a number of fine baroque-style variation sets by Lyons. Only one of the tunes Lyons composed survives; this is \"Miss Hamilton\" (Inion i Hamilton). However Lyons wrote variations on existing tunes of which five have survived, including \"The Coolin\" and \"Slieve Gallen\". \"Miss Hamilton\" was written in 1706.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donnchadh \u00d3 hAmhsaigh", "response": ["O'Hampsey did play some of Carolan's music but disliked it for being too modern.

Though Bunting's setting claims to present the tune with variations, it in fact appears to print only Lyons' once-fashionable baroque variations while omitting the main tune.Journal of the Irish folk Song Society, v1-2, Wm. Dawson, 1967, p.32 Patrick Weston Joyce, who said that Bunting's version was \"wanting in simplicity\", printed a version of the tune collected from the playing of a fiddler, Hugh O'Beirne, that he said was very similar to that he recalled being sung in his youth in 1830s County Limerick.Joyce, Old Irish Folk Music and Songs, 1909, p.299"]}]}}
