The station features live links to various locations, with international correspondent Will Parker (Benedict Cumberbatch). The station uses poor quality live satellite links to locations where events have not occurred yet (\"Donald Rumsfeld is very much his own man, and people here are talking about what he will not say as much as what he will say when he does turn up. He will probably not say what we expect him to say, because that's not his style\") and covers unimportant stories too, just to fill up the time (\"Due to a debate between TV producers and librarians, news channels cannot shoot new footage of libraries. These library pictures were shot months ago.\") The field reporters often ask the main anchors \"What more can you tell us\" \u2013  a complete role reversal."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["*Clare Wille (Acting Diploma 1997)"]}, {"page": "List of Heartbeat cast members", "response": ["| Clare Wille || DS Rachel Dawson || colspan=\"13\"  || colspan=\"5\" "]}, {"page": "Wille (surname)", "response": ["*Clare Wille (born 1973), English stage and television actor"]}, {"page": "Spats (radio series)", "response": ["Spats is a British radio comedy sketch series broadcast on digital radio station BBC 7.
