The Scottish Rugby Union needed to gain permission from the Rugby Football Union to play Pocock due to his nationality. Although Pocock was a quick player and scored many tries at club level, he was supported by a very strong Wanderers pack; at international level he was far more exposed. Pocock had a very good game for Scotland against Ireland, scoring a try on this debut match which Scotland won 6\u20130. Pocock was reselected for the very next game, played in Edinburgh against England just a month later. Despite a win for Scotland from a solitary dropped goal from Malcolm Cross, Pocock had a terrible match, and at one point was moved out of his three-quarter position and into the forwards. Pocock, never a favourite with the Scottish spectators due to being English, was never selected for Scotland again."]}, {"page": "Charles Touzel", "response": ["Just over a month later, Touzel was given his second international call up, this time an away game to Scotland.
