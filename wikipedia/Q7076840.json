Sainsbury once again lost the toss and was forced to field. Surrey batted for 222.1 overs as they accumulated 635 runs. Opening bowlers Parfitt and Winter once again conceded a century of runs apiece, and four of Somerset's other bowlers conceded over 50\u00a0runs each. In total, Sainsbury tried seven different bowlers during the innings to try to get wickets, including Herbie Hewett, who completed his career of 106 matches with just two first-class wickets. Sainsbury himself was the most successful of the bowlers, taking four wickets for 74\u00a0runs, his best first-class bowling performance. In reply, Somerset were bowled out for 83 runs, with Clapp recorded as \"absent hurt\". Following on, Somerset mustered a more respectable total of 251, aided primarily by a century from Octavius Radcliffe and 85 from Hewett. Sainsbury himself added 21 to the score in the second innings after being dismissed for one in the first. The defeat was heavier still than the one suffered a week earlier; Surrey won by an innings and 301 runs.", "Over the following two seasons, 1889 and 1890, Sainsbury played club cricket for Lansdown, but no county cricket, as he served his residential qualification for Gloucestershire. At Gloucestershire's annual meeting in April 1891, W. G. Grace welcomed Sainsbury to the club, and there was some mirth at the expense of Somerset regarding his move. His first appearance for his new county was in match in early May between \"Club and Ground\" sides from Gloucestershire and Glamorgan; his first-class debut for the county was against Kent later that month, when he scored 12\u00a0runs during a rain-affected match. He was not the only former Somerset player to appear for Gloucestershire in the match \u2013 his fellow opening partner at Somerset, Octavius Radcliffe, had moved across the county border in 1886. Sainsbury played 13 times for Gloucestershire that season, with his highest score being 36, made against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. He scored 259 runs at an average of 13.63, and did not bowl. An appearance for Lansdown that summer, against the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, saw him score 228 runs in a drawn match. The following year was his last in first-class cricket, during which he made five appearances, all for Gloucestershire, scoring 100\u00a0runs, at an average of 10.00. He continued to play for Lansdown, who he captained in 1893, scoring over 1,000 runs that season, Clifton, and the MCC for a number of years."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Octavius Radcliffe"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Octavius Radcliffe ", "During 1885 Somerset suffered badly from their lack of a strong bowling attack. Playing six matches, there were a total of 120\u00a0wickets on offer, but Somerset's bowlers took only 67. Edward Bastard, a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, was the county's leading wicket-taker, claiming 25\u00a0wickets during his four appearances, at an average of 15.32. His bowling average was not far below that of George Lohmann, who finished the season as the country's leading wicket taker, with 142\u00a0wickets from his 24\u00a0matches. Unfortunately for Somerset, Bastard was only able to play in four of the county's six matches, and of the other bowlers, the best bowling average was the 25.85 managed by Bill Roe, who took only seven wickets. Charles Winter, who took the next highest total of wickets, only managed to claim 15 in his 6\u00a0appearances. Batting was the strongest aspect of Somerset's play, but the club lacked the strength-in-depth of other county teams. Herbie Hewett, playing his second season of first-class cricket, finished with the highest batting average for the county with 35.28, a respectable average which exceeded a number of England Test batsmen that season. Only four Somerset batsman passed 50\u00a0runs in an innings\u00a0\u2013 Hewett, Octavius Radcliffe, Bill Roe, and Charles Winter\u00a0\u2013 and only Radcliffe advanced to reach a century during the season."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Octavius Radcliffe (1886\u20131893) : O.
