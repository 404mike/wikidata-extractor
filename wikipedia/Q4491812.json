Illiterate until 13, he showed no early signs of linguistic ability but despite this late start, at age 17 he was appointed schoolmaster of the village of Stralock.\nShortly after this he attended Kirkmichael school followed by Perth Grammar School and the University of St. Andrews, gaining a master's degree from the latter.\nIn 1823 he took a post at Calcutta Academy, but because of poor health he was forced to return to Europe in 1826. In 1837 he became Professor of Oriental Languages at King's College London and stayed at this post until his retirement in 1861. During his time at King's College London he also worked at the British Museum, cataloguing the collection of Persian manuscripts.\nDuring his lifetime he wrote a number of books and it is for these that he is most remembered. He had a hand in translating or editing a number of books in Urdu, Persian and Arabic, including a translation of Mir Amman's Urdu Bagh o Bahar, or Tales of the Four Darweshes, (which is itself a translation from the Persian of Amir Khusro), and of the Persian Adventures of Hatim Tai.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1798", "response": ["* April 28 \u2013 Duncan Forbes, British linguist (d. 1868)"]}, {"page": "Perthshire", "response": ["* Duncan Forbes"]}, {"page": "Cox\u2013Forbes theory", "response": ["The Cox\u2013Forbes theory is a long-debunked theory on the evolution of chess put forward by Captain Hiram Cox (1760\u20131799)Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh commemorates Captain Cox. and extended by Professor Duncan Forbes (1798\u20131868).", "* The History of Chess, 1860, by Duncan Forbes complete original text"]}, {"page": "List of chess historians", "response": ["*Professor Duncan Forbes"]}, {"page": "Bandra", "response": ["The name \"Bandra\" possibly originates from the Persian word for port, or \"bandar.\" It is described by Duncan Forbes's A Dictionary, Hindustani and English'(1848) as \"a city; an emporium; a port, harbor; a trading town to which numbers of foreign merchants resort\".
