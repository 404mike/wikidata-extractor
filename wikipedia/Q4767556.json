Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965. In the 16th century, the Reformation in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers Jane Anger, Aemilia Lanyer, and the prophetess Anna Trapnell. English and American Quakers believed that men and women were equal. Many Quaker women were preachers.W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). \"America's promise: a concise history of the United States\". Rowman & Littlefield. p. 75. . Despite relatively greater freedom for Anglo-Saxon women, until the mid-19th century, writers largely assumed that a patriarchal order was a natural order that had always existed.Maine, Henry Sumner. Ancient Law 1861. This perception was not seriously challenged until the 18th century when Jesuit missionaries found matrilineality in native North American peoples.Lafitau, Joseph Fran\u00e7ois, cited by Campbell, Joseph in, Myth, religion, and mother-right: selected writings of JJ Bachofen.
