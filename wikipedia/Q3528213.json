In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less.p70, Swanton The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; the rest of the team had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle.p69, Swanton Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either.p146, Andrew Ward, Cricket's Strangest Matches, Robson Books, 2001 In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.pp22-26, pp214-228, Fingletonp402, Colin Frith, Pageant of Cricket, Macmillan Company of Australia, 1987pp9-12, O'Reilly", "Rarely has the batting of a team been so dominated by one man as Len Hutton did the England side of 1950-51. He made 533 runs at an average of 88.83, 50 runs more than the next man Reg Simpson (38.77) and all the others except Freddie Brown (26.25) averaged under 20. He had broken his left arm in an accident on a commando course while a sergeant in the Army Physical Training Corps in the war and after an operation using 46 stitches, grafting bone from his leg onto his arm, which was left 2\u00a0inches (5\u00a0cm) shorter and weaker than his right.p47, Cary He was forced to review his technique and use a lightened bat, but his defence was flawless and he was an expert on 'sticky dogs' like Brisbane and averaged higher in post-war Tests than in his youth, when he had made the record score of 364 at the Oval in 1938. The Yorkshireman was saddled with the heavy burden of knowing that England depended on his skill and was the prime target of the Australian fast bowlers Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. Of Jack Iverson Hutton told Miller \"Ah'll show thee how to play 'im\", but never quite fathomed his mystery spin.p84, Keith Miller, Cricket Crossfire, Olbourne Press, 1956 England had one other great batsmen, the 'golden boy' Denis Compton whose heroic strokeplay had enthralled the crowds in 1946-47 and 1948. Unlike Hutton he had no inhibition about playing his shots, but had spent much of 1950 suffering from the knee injury that would plague his career. He went on the tour against the advice of his doctor, who warned that his leg may be immobilised and took pain-killing drugs throughout the visit. It is unlikely that any batsman has had such a checked tour as Compton in 1950-51, he averaged 7.57 in the Tests and 92.11 in the other First Class matches, a difference of nearly 85 runs. His loss of form at the highest level was a severe blow to England's chances. Reg Simpson came a poor second to Hutton in the Test averages, his 349 runs (38.77) being almost entirely dependent on his 156 not out on his 31st birthday in the Fifth and final Test. This innings was the finest of his career, first adding 131 with Hutton and 64 out of a stand of 74 for the last wicket to put England 103 runs ahead and gave them their first victory against Australia since 1938. It was the highest score of his Test career and he also made 269, his highest First Class hundred against the Sheffield Shield Champions New South Wales. He was a fearless and effective player of fast bowling, but had a habit of getting out to spin bowlers, who he regarded with contempt. Hutton's regular opening partner was the Lancashire stalwart Cyril Washbrook, with whom he added 359 against South Africa in 1948-49, still a record opening stand for England. He averaged over 50 against Don Bradman's 1948 Australians, but couldn't handle the mystery spin of Jack Iverson. Apart from the captain's own efforts - Freddie Brown came third in the England Test averages with 210 runs at 26.25 - the rest of the England batting was woefully poor. John Dewes had amassed 1,262 runs (78.88) for Cambridge and 739 (61.58) for Middlesex in 1950 with defensive prods and pushes.p402, Frith For Cambridge he added 343 vs the West Indies and 349 vs Sussex with David Sheppard, but they fared worse when not playing on the friendly wicket at Fenners. Sheppard is best remembered for taking holy orders, becoming the first Reverend to play Test cricket, becoming captain of Sussex and England and later Bishop of Liverpool. Gilbert Parkhouse was a Welsh middle order batsman who was sent in to open for Glamorgan in 1950 and made such as success of it that he broke the county record by making seven centuries in a season. The teenage Brian Close was chosen after he took 100 wickets and made 1,000 runs in 1949 and became England's youngest ever player aged 18 years and 149 days.p396, Frith Despite respectable all-round figures Close never reached the heights expected of him in Test cricket, though his tough, uncompromising, captaincy of Yorkshire, Somerset and England would become the stuff of legend. Trevor Bailey's barnacle-like qualities were already apparent and this notorious stonewaller tended to substitute stubbornness for strokeplay, though he made few runs in this series.pp214-228 Fingletonpp13-27, Kaypp9-15 & pp153-168, O'Reillypp80-82, Swanton", "England failed to match the Australians' high standards of fielding and were nicknamed Brown's Cows by the Australian barrackers.p10, Freddi They dropped six catches in a match against Victoria and made frequent mistakes in the state matches. However, they made a considerable improvement in the Tests with \"...first class work in the field, in direct contrast to the slovenly and often lackadaisical displays in the previous games of the tour\".p128, Kay Even so, they never reached the heights of catching and fielding displayed by the Australian team. Both Brown and Alec Bedser weighted 15 stone (over 200 lb or 100 kilos) and were particularly ungainly in the field, but their bucket-like hands picked up 9 catches and Brown twice caught and bowled Keith Miller. Godfrey Evans was the outstanding wicket-keeper of his generation whose enthusiasm could energise a fielding team and always entertained the crowd with his antics. His deputy was Arthur McIntyre, who kept wicket for Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and Tony Lock in the Surrey side that would win the County Championship seven times in a row in 1952-58. Len Hutton was a good slip and would pick up 9 catches in the series and Trevor Bailey took some great catches in the gully. Unfortunately the MCC had no other slip fielders and they were joined by Gilbert Parkhouse, who hated the role and frequently dropped catches.p25, Kay John Dewes was a good outfielder, but the rest of the team failed to impress and a picture of John Warr was used to illustrate how not to take catches.p400, Frith"]}, {"page": "1951 English cricket season", "response": [" || John Dewes || 10 || 515 || 116* || 64.37 || 2 "]}, {"page": "Dennis Good", "response": ["Good was born in Leeds and educated at Denstone College in Staffordshire, and at Sheffield University, where he studied textiles.

He hit three more boundaries in his 62 and they added 65 for the seventh wicket. Bailey was out first, bowled by Lindwall and Brown was caught by Johnson off Iverson. Godfrey Evans hit Lindwall straight to the boundary and took 8 runs off Miller, which resulted in a bouncer, which the keeper dodged like a boxer, and the bowler being booed. Evans cracked another four past point off Miller, who was removed from the attack, and passed 1,000 runs in Tests, but was \"c Johnson, b Iverson\" for 49 and was cheered by the crowd when he left. Alec Bedser (5 not out) had batted for nearly an hour helping Evans, but Doug Wright (2) only lasted five minutes and England were out for 197, exceeding Australia's First Innings by only 3 runs. This was both a failure and a relief, given how the innings had progressed.pp100-117, Fingletonpp154-157, Kaypp54-58, O'Reilly", "England needed 179 runs to win, not an impossible task even though John Dewes had been struck with a throat inflection and had been absent from the field. Brown continued with his opening partnership of Reg Simpson and Cyril Washbrook and kept Len Hutton in the middle order. To be fair they had made 212 for the first wicket against the West Indies at Trent Bridge earlier in the year. On this occasion they added 21 against Lindwall and Miller when the spinners were brought on. Washbrook always found \"Wrong Grip Jake\" difficult to play and was bowled by his googly. The nightwatchman Trevor Bailey by bowled by Ian Johnson (1/24) for a duck and England were 28/2 at stumps. Simpson and Hutton \"opened\" the innings again in the morning, Hutton was inclined to fancy England's chances if he stayed in past lunch, and he did, but Simpson was bowled by Lindwall (3/29) for 28. John Dewes, coming in to bat from his sick bed like Eddie Paynter in the Fourth Test of 1932\u201333, stayed in for 46\u00a0minutes making a gutsy 5 before falling to Iverson (2/36) at 82/4. In the lunch break England needed less than a hundred runs to win and there was an earnest discussion as to whether Hutton should bat in his usual careful way or should try to make the runs before he ran out of partners, as had happened at Brisbane. He decided on the latter and by forcing the pace struck out at Bill Johnston (4/26) and was caught at square leg for 40, which caused a deathly silence across the 50,000 strong crowd. As in the first innings Brian Close was soon out (lbw to Johnston for 1), Brown was bowled by Lindwall, who then removed Evans \"with a ball which pitched outside the off stump, came in at a crazy angle and knocked back the off stump without leaving the turf by a centimetre\".p107, Keith Miller, Cricket Crossfire, Oldbourne Press, 1956 Gilbert Parkhouse, who batted manfully for 102 minutes and when he was out for 28 England were 134/9 and still needed 45 to win. Alec Bedser (14 not out) had nothing to lose and struck out with the bat before Doug Wright (2) succumbed to Johnston and England were out for 150.pp126-137, Fingletonpp157-159, Kaypp65-70, O'Reilly", "England now had to win the final three Tests if they wanted to regain the Ashes, for which the only precedent was when Don Bradman made three big centuries in the 1936\u201337 Ashes series to win 3\u20132 after being 2\u20130 down to Gubby Allen's England side. Sydney is a famous spinning wicket, though the three tour matches the MCC had seen many runs for few wickets. In the New South Wales game immediately before the Third Test they had made 553/8 with Len Hutton making 150 and Reg Simpson 259 and the fast-medium bowler John Warr took 4/67. As a result the unhappy Brian Close was dropped in favour of Warr, making his debut, and England went into the Test with Doug Wright as the only specialist spinner, supported by the part-time spin of Freddie Brown and Denis Compton. The leg-spinner Eric Hollies had taken 5 wickets (78.60) in his three games at the Sydney Cricket Ground and off-spinner Bob Berry was going for 4 runs an over in his containment role and were not chosen. Denis Compton was fit again and replaced the ailing John Dewes, but Gilbert Parkhouse stayed in the team thanks to his fighting 28 at Melbourne and 92 against New South Wales. Australia kept the same team from the Second Test, though if they had lost the performances of a few of them would have resulted in their being dropped. For the only time in Lindsay Hassett's career as captain he lost the toss in an Ashes Test and Freddie Brown was able to bat first on another flat batting track.pp170-171, Kaypp73-74, O'Reilly"]}, {"page": "MCC tour of Australia in 1950\u201351", "response": ["Although they had won the 1947\u201348 Sheffield Shield Western Australia were its weakest team (Tasmania was not yet included) and isolated from the rest of Australia, so they provided an easy start for the MCC's round of state matches. The WACA Ground would not see a Test match until the 1970\u201371 Ashes series, so this was the only occasion for the Perth crowd to see a Test team in action. Freddie Brown won the toss and elected to bat, only to see his openers Reg Simpson and David Sheppard out for 5 runs, surprised by the swing they had been told was rare in Australia. Gilbert Parkhouse was bowled at 25/3 and it took Denis Compton (106) and John Dewes (94) to restore the innings with a partnership of 183. The vice-captain was particularity pleased with his century as it silenced the critics who thought him unfit to play and he managed to run between the wickets and step out to drive the bowlers without any fuss. Brian Close made an unbeaten 108, his maiden first-class century,https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/858/f_Batting_by_Season.html although he almost walked on 91 before he found that what he had thought was a catch had taken the ball over the boundary. Godfrey Evans (43) and Alec Bedser (42) helped him hit the ball around and Brown declared on 434/9. Doug Wright proved to have one of his more productive days, but his 7/60 failed to enforce the follow on by two runs as Western Australia reached 236 thanks to their captain Doug Carmody (59) and Chris Langdon (60). The MCC hustled up 121/3 in 124 minutes before Brown declared again and set the home team 320 to win in under three hours. Bedser was confined to bed with influenza and there was no fear of a result as Western Australia made 207/4 with Tom Outridge belting 3 sixes and 9 fours in his 92 with Close suffering 3/81 off 13 overs. This was the youngster's first proper bowl and it badly affected him and destroyed his confidence to bowl on Australian pitches where he could get little movement with the ball, to the point that Brown reserved him for the country matches after the Second Test. A disgruntled Gilbert Parkhouse had been shoved into the slip cordon, where he dropped three catches and the MCC's poor fielding soon lead to them being called Brown's Cows by the Australian press.pp39-44, Fingletonpp96-102, Kay", "Travelling north from Sydney to Brisbane the MCC stopped for a couple of country matches, the first in the industrial town of Newcastle, New South Wales. Len Hutton and Denis Compton had already proved their form and were rested as Freddie Brown took charge again. The first day of the match was washed out and the wicket was turning into an unpredictable mud-heap by the time the teams got to play. The local captain was Bob Beatty who had played against the MCC in 1936\u201337 under Gubby Allen and 1946\u201357 under Wally Hammond and made 69 in his teams 169 as Eric Hollies took a flattering 5/39 and Bob Berry 4/45 on a real turner. The MCC provided more material to the Australian Press by collapsing to a fast bowler called John Bull, who took 6/24 with the help of some good catching and had the tourists 37/4. They reached 142 all out thanks to the pugnacious John Dewes who made 71, with nobody else making more than Reg Simpson's 23. To concede a 27 run first innings deficit to a club side was an embarrassment, but given the state of the pitch it was not as bad as some critics made out. On the \"sticky dogs\" and \"glue-pots\" produced by uncovered wickets only the best batsmen could hope to make runs against any competent bowling attack.pp56-57, Fingletonpp238-239, Kay", "The MCC had a more enjoyable time at Lismore, New South Wales, near the border with Queensland. Unlike Newcastle this was in the open countryside and the players took advantage of the town's generous hospitality and the free membership of the local golf courses. David Sheppard (52), Reg Simpson (66) and John Dewes (50) made some easy runs in the MCC's 274 on the first day. One of the umpires so forgot himself that he led the appeals against the MCC captain when he was rapped on the pads then raised his arm to give him out lbw. The English bowlers shared the wickets in the Northern NSW's reply of 156. A hundred runs ahead Freddie Brown enforced the follow on, but the last afternoon was played easily and they did not press for victory after having the local team made 21/2 and they finished a happily played game on 55/2.p57, Fingletonpp170, O'Reilly", "With only one game before the First Test Brown's men had to improve their form dramatically if they wanted to stand a chance against the powerful Australian team. Instead they conceded another first innings deficit to a weak Sheffield Shield team. the wicket-keeper-captain Don Tallon won the toss and batted and the MCC bowlers did quite well in the circumstances, Alec Bedser (3/40) and John Warr (3/70) having Queensland 23/2, but whatever good work they did was undone by slack fielding, poor catching and some new batsman making runs. Ken Archer (63), who would make his Test debut in the series added 120 with Aubrey Carrigan (100) and Ernest Toovey (58 not out) added 81 for the ninth wicket with Lawrence Chapman (38). The second day was rained off as they batted into the third day for 305. The local swing bowler Len Johnson took 6/66 in an innings of 291 that relied almost entirely on Cyril Washbrook (82) and John Dewes (117), both fighting their way back into form and jeered by the crowd as they ground out their unsightly innings. With Denis Compton making a dull 28 in 100 minutes and nobody else making 15 by the time they had finished only three overs could be bowled before stumps, but Warr picked up a wicket for no runs. The press were unsympathetic and with rumours that Hutton (damaged finger), Denis Compton (swollen knee) and Alec Bedser (influenza) were all ill or injured some wondered if the Test was worth playing. There were also the usual stories of dissension in the ranks whenever a team performs badly, which Brown hotly denied, thus providing a new story. In truth Brown ran a happy ship and allowed the team more socialising than previous captains. He also saw no reason why he should force amateur undergraduates to mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger team-mates.pp58-60, Fingletonpp31-32 & pp122-127, Kay", "The Australia XI match against the MCC used to be seen as virtually another Test match and important for the Australian selectors to see up and coming cricketers in action before choosing a team. For some reason in 1950\u201351 it was scheduled between the First and Second Tests and after the team for the latter had already been announced. Even if someone made a century or took ten wickets they could not be picked for the Australian team until the Third Test early in 1951, though Ken Archer and Jim Burke had been named in the XII and were fighting to avoid being the twelfth man. The game was held in Sydney as their rivals Melbourne were hosting two of the Tests. The Australian vice captain Arthur Morris was in charge on his home ground with local hero Keith Miller and the Victorian Neil Harvey who hardly needed testing. The batsmen Graeme Hole, wicket-keeper Gil Langley and bowlers Alan Walker, Geoff Noblet and Chris Langdon were also included, as was Ritchie Benaud, but he was too ill to play and was replaced by the veteran leg-spinner Doug Ring. Morris won the toss again and batted on a flat Sydney wicket, he added 170 with Ken Archer (81) before he was out for exactly 100, Harvey (40), Miller (62), Burke (128) and Hole (41) piled up the runs and Morris declared during the second day's tea interval for 526/9. John Warr (2/89) opened the bowling, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown failed to take a wicket and Eric Hollies (3/108) and Bob Berry (2/108 off just 14 overs) could not contain the attack. The two spinners could not blame the fielding as they each dropped Morris of their own bowling, and Berry dropping him off Hollies. Alan Walker (5/60) and Doug Ring (3/106) reduced the MCC's reply to 47/3 by stumps and it was up to Denis Compton (115) and nightwatchman Godfrey Evans (31) to restore the innings with a partnership of 85, followed by another of 130 between Compton and Gilbert Parkhouse (58). Burke added to his credentials be taking a great catch in gully to dismiss a tired Compton, leaving Brown to punch 46 before the tail gave way five runs short of saving the follow on. Morris sent the MCC back in to bat and saw them fall to 22/2 before John Dewes (66 not out) and Parkhouse (46 not out) saved the day. Dewes retired hurt at 66/2, but returned after Compton was dismissed for 29 and they ended on 173/3. Although Jim Burke made the most runs he carried the drinks in the Second Test and Archer opened with Morris, but Burke was chosen for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and made a century on debut. Langley proved to be a competent keeper, but failed to oust Don Tallon despite the latter's lack of form. The results for Freddie Brown were more dire, Compton's knee had swollen again due to his exertions and he was unfit to play at Melbourne, Berry and Hollies had proved incapable of containing the Australian batsmen and Bedser and Brown has lost the form which had caught Australia out at Brisbane. The only good news was that John Dewes had shown his fighting abilities regardless of form and a fair crowd had come to watch, so increasing coffers of the MCC Manager John Nash.pp100-102, Fingletonpp142-148, Kay", "Some of the oldest grade clubs in Australia are in Tasmania, but it was a weak state side that would not fully complete in the Sheffield Shield for another 25 years. Freddie Brown took a holiday in Victoria, Len Hutton went on a cruise to Sydney and Doug Wright took a break as well. Alec Bedser's identical twin brother Eric was in Australia on business (they were inseparable and lived together for 90 years) and was asked to help the MCC rest some of its players after the injuries and fatigue of the Third Test. Alec and Eric tossed a coin in their youth to see who would remain a fast bowler so that they could both get into the Surrey Colts, Eric lost and became an opening batsman and off-spinner. As always the Tasmanians were delighted to meet the MCC team and their stay on the island was always regarded as the most pleasant part of the tour. Tom Davidson won the toss for Tasmania, but they batted haphazardly towards 197 as John Warr (4/47) and Alec Bedser (4/56) worked their way through the team. The hero of the day was Keith Dollery (3/30), \"a fast-medium bowler who bowls with his cap on and touches the ground for luck with his finger before he takes off\"p153, Fingleton who removed the MCC openers David Sheppard and John Dewes and was carried off the field by his team-mates as the tourists were struggled to 18/2 at stumps. He had nightwatchman Godfrey Evans out in the morning for 28/3, but Reg Simpson (28), captain Denis Compton (41), Cyril Washbrook (61) and Alec Bedser (35) righted the ship and the MCC made 234, a lead of 42 runs. Tasmania did better second time round and reached 209/4 with Compton disappearing for 2/72 off 11 overs before Alec Bedser (4/30) and Warr (3/39) finished off the tail and the last six wickets fell for 20 runs. This left the MCC 187 runs to win in 135 minutes. This was achieved thanks to Sheppard (67 not out), Simpson (43) and Compton (77 not out), who hit the last six balls to the boundary before an enthusiastic crowd.pp153-154Fingleton"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* John Dewes (1948\u20131950)"]}, {"page": "Dewes", "response": ["*John Dewes (1926\u20132015), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John Dewes, 88, cricketer (Middlesex, England)."]}, {"page": "November 1950", "response": ["*After rain prevented play on the first day of their match against New South Wales Country, the touring MCC side's batting collapsed to a fast bowler called John Bull, who took 6/24.
