The son of a former music hall artiste turned fishmonger, he was a keen jazz enthusiast and self-taught amateur pianist. He took it upon himself to organize lunchtime entertainment at the factory, assembling scratch bands from among the workers.\"With his band, George Webb's Dixielanders, he played regularly and famously at The Red Barn public house at Barnehurst, Kent, from the early 1940s. \"No one has ever seriously challenged their claim to have been the first British revivalist jazz band\". They made several recordings and BBC radio broadcasts. The Dixielanders disbanded in January 1948.Webb was then part of Humphrey Lyttelton's band from September 1948 to June 1951. He reformed the Dixielanders in 1952, but this did not last long and he then concentrated  on running a jazz club at the Shakespeare Hotel in Woolwich. From the mid-1960s he was an agent and manager for musicians. Early in the following decade, he returned to playing more frequently and toured Europe as a soloist. Another version of the Dixielanders operated from 1973 to 1974, and then Webb ran a pub in Essex for 12 years. After moving back to Kent, Webb was a guest in various bands into the 2000s.Among the musicians who played in the Dixielanders at various times were the British jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton, Wally Fawkes the clarinettist and Eddie Harvey the trombonist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Humphrey Lyttelton", "response": ["They had both joined the George Webb Dixielanders in 1947. Webb was an important catalyst in the British postwar jazz boom."]}, {"page": "Trad jazz", "response": ["In Britain,  where boogie-woogie, \"stride\" piano and jump blues were popular in the 1940s, George Webb's Dixielanders  pioneered a trad revival during the Second World War, and Ken Colyer's  Crane River band added and maintained a strong thread of New Orleans purism. Humphrey Lyttelton, who played with Webb, formed his own band based on the New Orleans/Louis Armstrong tradition in 1948 but, without losing the Armstrong influence, gradually adopted a more mainstream approach. By 1958 his band included three saxophones. During the 1950s and well into the 1960s the \"Three B's\" Chris Barber, Acker Bilk, and Kenny Ball were particularly successful, all making hit records. Other successful bands including Terry Lightfoot, George Chisholm, Monty Sunshine, Mick Mulligan, with George Melly, and Mike Cotton \u2013 who \"went R'n'B\" in 1963\u20134 \u2013 made regular appearances live, on the air and occasionally in the British charts, as did Louis Armstrong himself. More light-hearted versions were offered by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, the Temperance Seven and the New Vaudeville Band. Dixieland stylings can be found here and there on records by the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Small Faces and the Kinks, while the Who actually performed trad jazz in their early days."]}, {"page": "Barnehurst", "response": ["As in much of suburban London, Barnehurst railway station was opened to encourage building of houses.

It reached Britain through recordings and performers who visited the country while it was a relatively new genre, soon after the end of World War I. Jazz began to be played by British musicians from the 1930s and on a widespread basis in the 1940s, often within dance bands.

Significant instrumentalists in this early movement were trumpeter-pianist Denis Rose, pianist Tommy Pollard, saxophonist Don Rendell, and drummers Tony Kinsey and Laurie Morgan. A movement in an opposite direction was revivalism, which became popular in the 1950s and was represented by musicians like George Webb, Humphrey Lyttelton and Ken Colyer, although Lyttelton gradually became more catholic in his approach. Trad jazz, a variant, briefly entered the pop charts later. At this point both streams tended to emulate Americans, whether it be Charlie Parker for Beboppers or Joe \"King\" Oliver and other New Orleans musicians for traditionalists, rather than try to create a uniquely British form of jazz."]}, {"page": "1917 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** George Webb, jazz musician (died 2010)"]}, {"page": "George Webb", "response": ["George Webb may refer to:", "* George Webb (bishop) (1594\u20131642), Anglican bishop in Ireland", "* George Webb (judge) (1828\u20131891), judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria", "* George Webb (politician) (1886\u20131958), member of Canadian Parliament", "* George Webb (actor) (1912\u20131998), English actor", "* George Webb (musician) (1917\u20132010), British jazz musician", "* George Webb (cricketer) (1857\u20131931), English cricketer", "* George Webb (footballer, born 1888) (\u20131915), English international football player for West Ham United", "* George Webb (footballer, born 1991), English football player for Bournemouth", "* George Webb Restaurants, a Wisconsin restaurant chain", "* George Webbe (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*10 March \u2013 George Webb, jazz musician (b. 1917)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2010", "response": ["*George Webb, 92, British traditional jazz musician"]}, {"page": "Music of the United Kingdom (1950s)", "response": ["Jazz reached Britain from America through recordings and performers who visited the country while it was a relatively new genre, soon after the end of the First World War.
