The resulting short series, entitled Vivian Stanshall's Radio Flashes, was recorded under the supervision of Peel's regular producer John Walters and broadcast on BBC Radio One in August 1971. The series of four two-hour programmes were a mix of music and specially written and recorded comedic sketches. Out of the original four episodes, only episodes 2, 3 and 4 remain in the BBC archives, and these were re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2014 and again in 2016. However, since the 1970s, all four episodes and a Christmas 1971 compilation special have circulated among collectors as low-quality, edited off-air recordings. Contributors to the sketches in Radio Flashes included Moon, Traffic's Jim Capaldi and actress Chris Bowler. The sketches included a four-part serial adventure titled \"Breath From The Pit\", featuring the surreal exploits of a Dick Barton or Bulldog Drummond-style gentleman adventurer, Colonel Knutt (played by Stanshall) and his working-class sidekick, the 'likeable cheeky cockney, Lemmy'. The serial was also partly a parody of Charles Chilton's Journey into Space, with Moon playing the role of Lemmy."]}, {"page": "1963 in music", "response": ["* Oh, What a Lovely War!
