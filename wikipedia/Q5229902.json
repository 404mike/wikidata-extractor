In 1920, he wrote \"Discontent on the Lower Deck\", an article for the communist publication Workers' Dreadnought, leading to his dismissal from the Navy for \"associating with extremists\".Springhall joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and its affiliated Young Communist League (YCL).  He worked as a builder, but struggled to find employment, focussing his time on the National Unemployed Workers' Committee Movement and the trade union movement.  He stood as a Labour Party candidate for Richmond Town Council, then later as a Communist candidate, but was not elected.In 1924, Springhall was a delegate to the Fifth Congress of the Communist International, and also the Fourth Congress of the Young Communist International.  In 1926, following the imprisonment of William Rust, he became Acting Secretary of the YCL, serving during the British general strike, for which he was twice jailed himself.  From 1928 to 1931, Springhall studied at the International Lenin School.  He then returned to the UK, when he led moves to expel Trotskyists from the CPGB.  From this period on, he may have been working for the GRU. By 1937 he was secretary of the London district of the Communist party and a member of the party's Political Bureau.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Morning Star (British newspaper)", "response": [":1938: Dave Springhall"]}]}}
