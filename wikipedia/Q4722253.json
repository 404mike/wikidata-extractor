He was born at Ightham, Kent, England and died at Caterham, Surrey.A right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler, Atfield played for Kent's second eleven before qualifying for Gloucestershire, for whom he played three first-class matches in 1893. Those were the only competitive first-class games of his career and in the third of them, batting at No 10 in the match against Kent, Atfield scored 45, which was his highest first-class score. He was then recruited to play as a professional by the mill-owning cricket patron W. H. Laverton, who ran his own country-house cricket team at Leighton House, Westbury in Wiltshire. Over the next few years, Atfield played in many non-first-class games alongside some of the leading amateur players of the time: Laverton himself was the father-in-law of Lionel Palairet, for example, who was often included in Laverton\u2019s teams. While employed by Laverton, he also played regularly in Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire in the early seasons of the Minor Counties Championship.From 1897 onwards, Atfield divided his time between playing, coaching and umpiring commitments in England and South Africa. In the 1897\u201398 South African cricket season, he was a professional in Durban club cricket and played a single first-class match for Natal in that season. By 1900, he was back in England playing for W. G. Grace's London County team and the following year he became a professional for the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, appearing in a couple of first-class matches in the 1901 season. In the second of these games, for MCC against London County, Atfield took his only first-class wickets; his first victim as a bowler was Grace.Atfield began umpiring first-class matches with MCC from 1902 and by 1905 he had graduated to umpiring in County Championship matches in the English first-class season, remaining on the first-class umpires list in England until 1924 and thereafter standing in occasional matches through to 1932. He continued to spend his winters in South Africa, and in 1906\u201307, in a series of three matches between Transvaal and Border he umpired two games and played for Transvaal in the third: his final first-class appearance as a player.Most of Atfield's time in South Africa was spent as a coach and he was credited as an influence in the development of Bob Catterall at Jeppe High School for Boys in Johannesburg. He umpired only occasional first-class matches in South Africa, but was called on as an umpire for four Tests on each of two successive tours of South Africa by England teams \u2013 the 1909\u201310 tour and the 1913\u201314 tour. He acted as umpire in England in Gentlemen v Players matches and in a Test trial match in 1927, but was not picked to umpire any Tests in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Alfred Atfield||||8||1910||1914"]}, {"page": "Harry Lee (cricketer)", "response": ["Along with approximately 25 other boys, Lee was invited for a trial at Lord's early in 1906, and bowled under the observation of Alfred Atfield and the head groundsman, Tom Hearne. Lee described his first over as \"six of the worst balls that anyone can ever have pitched\", but as his nerves calmed, he improved, and was eventually selected as one of the five ground staff boys by Hearne.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 12\u201313. As a ground boy, Lee had numerous tasks; sweeping, dusting and cleaning the seats, preparing nets, marking the pitch, weeding and similar. On a match day, jobs included selling scorecards, operating the score-board or fielding in the practice nets.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 14\u201315. All of this left little time for the boys to practise their own game. No formal coaching was in place, but Lee was guided by a few different players; England internationals Teddy Wynyard and Albert Trott among them.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 19. In the 1909 and 1910 seasons, Lee started to gain some attention from Middlesex County Cricket Club: he scored 39 runs in a match for the Middlesex Colts in 1909, and 60 runs against Reading Cricket Club in 1910.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 26. He was making more appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), collecting runs and wickets regularly, but not prolifically. In 1911, when a number of the Middlesex side were missing due to trial matches for England selection, Lee was invited to join the team for two County Championship matches in the south-west, against Somerset and Gloucestershire.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 26\u201327. Placed at number eleven in Middlesex's batting order, Lee batted once in a rain-affected match against Somerset, remaining four not out, and was not required to bowl. Lee did bowl against Gloucestershire, but remained wicketless from nine overs in the match."]}, {"page": "Bob Catterall", "response": ["Catterall was educated at Jeppe High School for Boys in Johannesburg where he was coached by the former Gloucestershire cricketer and Lord's coach Alfred Atfield."]}, {"page": "Douglas James Smith", "response": ["He stood as an umpire six times in first-class cricket, including replacing Alfred Atfield for the fifth Test between South Africa and England at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth in 1913\u201314.
