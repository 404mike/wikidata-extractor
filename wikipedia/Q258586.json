A member of the Conservative Party, she has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Bedfordshire since 2005.\nBorn in Liverpool to a working-class family, Dorries began work as a trainee nurse and subsequently became a medical representative. During her early career, she spent a year in Zambia as the head of a community school. After returning to the UK, she founded Company Kids Ltd; which provided child day-care services for working parents. She sold the company in 1998.\nDorries was first elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for the Conservative safe seat of Mid Bedfordshire. As a backbencher, she introduced several unsuccessful Private Member's Bills, including attempts to reduce the time limit for abortions in the UK and changes to the rules regarding counselling for the women involved, and the advocacy of sexual abstinence for girls in sex education. An opponent of John Bercow, she attempted to have him removed as Speaker of the House of Commons. She also clashed with David Cameron and George Osborne, describing them as \"two arrogant posh boys\". In 2012, the Conservative whip was suspended from Dorries after she took part in the reality TV programme I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! without informing the Chief Whip. The whip was returned to Dorries in 2013 and she was re-admitted to the parliamentary party.\nIn July 2019, Boris Johnson appointed Dorries as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Care with responsibility for mental health, suicide prevention and patient safety and in May 2020 she was advanced as Minister of State. In Johnson's Cabinet reshuffle of September 2021, he promoted her as Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 21", "response": ["*  1957   \u2013 Nadine Dorries, English nurse and politician"]}, {"page": "Conservative Party (UK)", "response": ["Most oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24\u2011week abortion limit.
