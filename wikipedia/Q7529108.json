She travelled to Paris to study the teaching methods at the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, the institution for the deaf and dumb run by the Venerable Abbe Sicard (d.1822). On her return home she sought out two similarly affected children and taught them herself. She was successful in her methods and was instrumental in establishing  a school in Alphington Road, in Exeter, the precursor of the present Royal West of England School for the Deaf. She wrote a series of articles later published in a book entitled \"Education for the People\". In 1838 Sir Thomas Acland established the Exeter Diocesan Education Committee, the first in Great Britain, which by 1840 had established St Luke's Teachers' Training College in Cathedral Close, Exeter. Thus there was little further need for Posbury School which closed and was for a while used as a Sunday School. In the 1920s, by which time it was serving only as a storage shed, it was demolished and its building stone served to make buttresses for the walls of St Luke's Chapel.http://posbury.org.uk/school.html"]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 12th Baronet", "response": ["Born in Queen Anne Street in London, he was the son of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Baronet and Mary Mordaunt."]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Baronet, MP 1837\u201386, and sons Thomas, MP 1882\u201392, and Arthur, MP 1885\u201399."]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Baronet; MP for West Somerset (1837\u20131847)"]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Acland, 11th Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Baronet"]}]}}
