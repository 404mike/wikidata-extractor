One night, attending a London Film-Makers' Co-op screening, she decided that her future lay in the moving image. After taking advice from Dave Parsons at Central St Martins she elected to study Time Based Media at Maidstone College of Art (from 1991 to 1994), despite not being able to show much evidence of any accomplishment in either film or video. Her ambition, aspiration and intellect however, was more than enough to convince tutors A. L. Rees and Steve Littman that here was someone very special. David Hall (video artist), doyen of British video art, had established the programme in the early 1970s and his legacy and ideas on video and film as artforms were still very influential. These ideas she was later to combine with those of her PhD supervisor Malcolm Le Grice, in a 'unified' theoretical framework (unifying film and video within an expanded definition of Expanded Cinema) evidenced in her articles for Millennium Film Journal and Filmwaves.filmwaves", "* Hatfield Jackie, Proto-, Photo and Post-Photo-Cinema in Expanded Cinema: Art, Performance and Film, A.
