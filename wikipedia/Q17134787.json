He entered Lincoln's Inn to study law and was called to the bar in 1858 but never practiced law.\nInstead he took up journalism, working for the Daily News before 1861, was involved at Action's Chronicle and then joined the Saturday Review. He moved to The Economist and in 1878 became their joint-editor. In 1883 he succeeded Martin Sharpe as editor of the Guardian, the weekly high church Anglican newspaper, which he edited for 16 years until his dismissal in 1899 for his unfashionable political and ecclesiastical views.\nIn 1900 he started his own newspaper, the Pilot, which folded for financial reasons after 4 years and concentrated thereafter on writing. He spent the next few years on his best-known book, editing Gladstones Correspondence on Church and Religion.\nHe died at his country cottage at Hascombe, Surrey in 1922. He had married in 1868 Bertha Penrose Price, the youngest daughter of Professor Bonamy Price. Their daughter Mary married Jonathan Christie.", "link_mentions": {}}}
