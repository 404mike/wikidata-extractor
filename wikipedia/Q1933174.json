At the start of the race, Tanzanians Gidamis Shahanga and Juma Ikangaa raced to the lead and were 50\u00a0m ahead of the pack after five minutes. After the 20\u00a0km mark, this gap had widened to several hundred meters. At the half way Mark, De Castella developed diarrhoea. In 100% humidity, he let go of his bowels and signalled for some damp towels from his crew members. By the 23\u00a0km mark, Ikangaa had taken the lead from his compatriot, with de Castella in the main pack some 250 m behind, but closing. de Castella passed the now tiring Shahanga at the 38\u00a0km mark, and in the next kilometre drew level with Ikangaa then took the lead. However Ikangaa was not done yet, and re-took the lead slightly.  The duel continued for the remainder of the race. Eventually de Castella pulled away, and won by 80 m in a time of 2:09:18, 12 seconds ahead of Ikangaa. Briton Mike Gratton finished third in 2:12:06, and Shahanga faded to finish 6th.
