Archer also played one Test match for Lord Hawke's XI England on their 1898-99 tour to South Africa: this was his first appearance in first-class cricket. He also played for Incogniti (1897-1900), and I Zingari (1903).\nAlthough Archer was a wicket-keeper, he did not keep wicket or bowl in the Test match in which he played, and he batted at number 10. Overall, Archer had an undistinguished career: he did not even get into the first XI at his school at Haileybury. Archer also turned out for the Marylebone Cricket Club and for minor counties Worcestershire, and Shropshire between 1894 and 1903 while playing at club level for Ludlow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Archer (surname)", "response": ["* Alfred Archer (1871\u20131935), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Alfred Archer \u00b7"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1895\u20131914)", "response": ["* Alfred Archer (1899\u20131903) : A.
