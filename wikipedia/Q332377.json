During Labour's time in Opposition to Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, he rose through the Shadow Cabinet, serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade (1979\u20131982), Shadow Secretary of State for Energy (1982\u20131983), Shadow Secretary of State for Employment (1983\u20131984), Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1984\u20131987) and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer (1987\u20131992).\nAfter Labour leader Neil Kinnock resigned following the Party's surprise loss in the 1992 general election to new Conservative leader John Major, Smith was elected his successor in July 1992. He continued Kinnock's moves to reform Labour, abolishing the trade union block vote at Labour party conferences and replacing it with \"one member, one vote\" at the 1993 party conference. However, his overall cautious approach to reform, which was dubbed \"one more heave\", sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government. This frustrated figures on the Labour right, such as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

This, coupled with the professionalising of the party machine's approach to the media, helped Labour win a historic landslide at the 1997 general election, after eighteen consecutive years of Conservative rule. Some observers say the Labour Party had by then morphed from a democratic socialist party to a social democratic party, a process which delivered three general election victories but alienated some of its core base; leading to the formation of the Socialist Labour Party.

The Labour lead was gradually narrowed over the next two years, as the Conservatives gained some credit for the strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment.
