Of this work two parts appeared, comprising the parishes of Chelsea, Kensington, Fulham, Hammersmith, Chiswick, and Acton. A third part was promised, which would have extended through Ealing, New Brentford, Isleworth, and Hanwell; but from want of encouragement Bowack proceeded no further.\nA specimen of his skill in ornamental handwriting is to be seen in Harleian MS. 1809, a thin vellum book, containing two neat drawings in Indian ink, and various kinds of English text and print hands, which was sent to Lord Oxford in December 1712, with a letter, wherein the author expresses the hope that his little work may find a place in his lordship's library. Bowack was appointed in July 1732 clerk to the commissioners of the turnpike roads, and in 1737 assistant-secretary to the Westminster Bridge commissioners, with a salary of \u00a3100 a year. The date of his death appears to be unknown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of geographers", "response": ["*John Bowack (England, fl. 1737)"]}, {"page": "Parsons Green", "response": ["Timber rights attached to the Green are mentioned in court rolls dating from 1391.

The prebendal manor house was extended to accommodate Westminster School in around 1570. There appears to have been a group of \"imposing\" houses on Chiswick Mall in the Early Modern period, including a large house on the site of Walpole House, since by 1706 John Bowack wrote of \"very ancient\" houses beside the river at Chiswick. A house on the site of Bedford House was inhabited by the Russell family in around 1664; it and others nearby were later rebuilt."]}]}}
