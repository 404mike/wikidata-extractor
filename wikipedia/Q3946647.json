In the episode \"T.A.H.I.T.I.\", S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson discovers a blue-skinned corpse in a secret, underground facility called the Guest House while searching for the source of the regenerative GH-325 serum. Executive producer Jeffrey Bell later confirmed that this was the body of a Kree. In the episode \"Yes Men\", Coulson asks Sif if she has encountered any blue-colored alien species. The Kree are among the species she lists by name, though she insists they have never visited Earth. In season 2 episodes \"...Ye Who Enter Here\", \"What They Become\", and \"Who You Really Are\", it is revealed that a rogue Kree faction visited Earth as part of their experiments to create genetically altered soldiers. According to Raina, in contrast to others believing they were acting to conquer or destroy humanity, the Kree created the Diviners for the purpose of engineering Inhumans while wiping out those the relics deem unworthy of the process. The episode \"Who You Really Are\" revealed that these Kree, whose experiments failed on other planets, have been eliminated by the Kree Empire. Having been alerted by a signal, a Kree warrior named Vin-Tak (played by Eddie McClintock) came to Earth to find the remaining Diviners that the rogue Kree faction hid on Earth to ensure the experiments would not resume in the event that the remnants of the rogue Kree faction came to Earth. Running afoul of Coulson's team and Sif, whose memory he temporarily robbed with his truncheon, Vin-Tak learned that Skye was an Inhuman and attempts to kill her. Luckily, Bobbi Morse uses Vin-Tak's truncheon to have himself forget why he came to Earth as Sif escorts him back to Hala. In the episode \"Scars\", it is shown that Robert Gonzales' faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. has obtained a monolith-like material that the Kree planned to use to destroy the Inhumans. This rock sends anyone who is sucked into it to another planet where an Inhuman being known as Hive was banished to. In the episode \"Failed Experiments,\" it was revealed that the Kree warriors known as Kree Reapers were the ones responsible for abducting the humans for the Inhuman experiments just like they did with the Mayan warrior that became Hive. When the device that was used to make Inhumans was activated by Hive, it attracted the attention of the Kree Reapers where one of them killed Alisha Whitley. Both of them were killed by Hive and Daisy Johnson where the blood of one of them was used in Hive's Inhuman-making projects. Season Five introduced the Kree Kasius (portrayed by Dominic Rains), Sinara (portrayed by Florence Faivre), Hek-Sel (portrayed by Luke Massy) and Kasius' brother Faulnak (portrayed by Samuel Roukin) who exist in the year 2091. The episode \"The One Who Will Save Us All\" introduces the Kree Taryan (portrayed by Craig Parker) who is the father of Kasius and Faulnak and the Kree's representative on the Confederacy."]}, {"page": "Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby", "response": ["*Samuel Roukin, actor"]}, {"page": "The End", "response": ["* The End (2008 film), a Spanish short starring Samuel Roukin"]}, {"page": "Royal Court Theatre", "response": ["* Seven Jewish Children by Caryl Churchill, directed by Dominic Cooke, starring Ben Caplan, David Horovitch, Daisy Lewis, Ruth Posner, Samuel Roukin, Susannah Wise and Alexis Zegerman (2009)"]}, {"page": "Counterpart (TV series)", "response": ["* James Cromwell as Yanek (season 2), the warden of Echo, an underground facility in the Prime world, the scientist from Alpha in 1987 (played by Samuel Roukin) whose inattentive moment allowed an experiment to run amok and create Prime and the single corridor connecting the two worlds"]}, {"page": "College of North West London", "response": ["*Samuel Roukin, actor"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2008", "response": ["| Happy-Go-Lucky || Miramax Films || Mike Leigh (director/screenplay); Sally Hawkins, Eddie Marsan, Alexis Zegerman, Andrea Riseborough, Sinead Matthews, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Joseph Kloska, Samuel Roukin.
