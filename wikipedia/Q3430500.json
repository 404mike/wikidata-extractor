During his mission in Madagascar from 1872 onwards, he travelled extensively and collected a large number of plants; he sent roughly 12,000 specimens to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, and also deposited collections in other herbaria. He may have discovered up to 1000 new plant species. Besides botany, Baron was also interested in geology and collected amphibians. He quickly learned Malagasy, and published the first Malagasy-language textbooks on plants and geology. Together with James Sibree, Jr., another missionary, he edited the English-language journal Antananarivo Annual.His Compendium des plantes malgaches was the first summary of the vascular plant species known from Madagascar. It was compiled in several volumes from 1900 to 1906 and would eventually list over 4700 species and varieties in 970 genera.Baron died in 1907 from a fever attack while he was in England. Several Malagasy taxa were named after him, including the plant genera Baronia, Baroniella, and Neobaronia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mantella", "response": ["Mantella are an example of convergent evolution\u2014the independent evolution of a similar trait with species of a different lineage. In this, they are similar to the family Dendrobatidae from Latin America in size, appearance and also some aspects of their behaviour. However, they are in no means related to the famous neotropical family. During the early description of the first specimens from 1866 to 1872, Alfred Grandidier described both the brown mantella (Mantella betsileo) and Malagasy mantella (Mantella madagascariensis) and placed them within the genus Dendrobates, based upon their close resemblance to them. Of course, the placement of these new species was ambiguous and heavily debated until in 1882, George Albert Boulenger created the genus Mantella after describing both Cowan's mantella (Mantella cowanii) and later in 1888 Baron's mantella (Mantella baroni). The species was named by Boulenger after the gentleman that collected the specimens, Rev. Richard Baron who was a missionary and botanist living in Madagascar. Baron was also interested in geology and herpetology, collecting many specimens upon his extensive expeditions across the country.  This species of course, is incredibly similar in colouration to Mantella madagascariensis with exception to the ventral/underside markings. In 1889 after the description of Mantella baroni, a French naturalist called Alexandre Thominot described a species he named as Phrynomantis maculatus and stated the type locality of the species was upon the R\u00e9union Island. However, not only is this highly dubious but later this locality was corrected to the off-shore Malagasy islands of Nosy B\u00e9 and Nosy Komba. Furthermore, Phrynomantis maculatus was to be synonymised with Mantella baroni."]}, {"page": "Dalbergia baronii", "response": ["Dalbergia baronii  is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae.

Twentieth-century authors, including Henri Perrier de la B\u00e2thie and Henri Humbert, built upon this concept and proposed several similar classification systems, based on floristic and structural criteria. A classification from 2007, the Atlas of the vegetation of Madagascar, distinguishes 15 vegetation types (including two degraded types and cultivation) based on satellite imagery and ground surveys; they are defined mainly based on vegetation structure and differ in species composition in different parts of the island. They partly correspond to the seven terrestrial ecoregions defined by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Madagascar.", "French naturalist Alfred Grandidier was a preeminent 19th-century authority on Malagasy wildlife. His first visit in 1865 was followed by several other expeditions. He produced an atlas of the island and, in 1885, published L'Histoire physique, naturelle et politique de Madagascar, which would comprise 39 volumes. Although his main contributions were in zoology, he was also a prolific plant collector; several plants were named after him, including Grandidier's baobab (Adansonia grandidieri) and the endemic succulent genus Didierea. The British missionary and naturalist Richard Baron, Grandidier's contemporary, lived in Madagascar from 1872 to 1907 where he also collected plants and discovered up to 1,000 new species; many of his specimens were described by Kew botanist John Gilbert Baker. Baron was the first to catalogue Madagascar's vascular flora in his Compendium des plantes malgaches, including over 4,700 species and varieties known at that time.", "The native flora of Madagascar has been and still is used for a variety of purposes by the Malagasy people. More than a hundred plants used locally and commercially were described at the end of the 19th century by the English naturalist Richard Baron. These included many timber trees such as native ebony (Diospyros) and rosewood (Dalbergia) species, the raffia palm Raphia farinifera used for fibre, dyeing plants, as well as medicinal and edible plants."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (Q\u2013R)", "response": ["* R.Baron \u2013 Richard Baron (1847\u20131907)"]}, {"page": "R.Baron", "response": ["#REDIRECT:Richard Baron (botanist)"]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"Baron\"|Richard Baron"]}, {"page": "William Deans Cowan", "response": ["*Richard Baron"]}]}}
