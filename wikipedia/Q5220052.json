Despite Westbrook's claims that her close friend Mike Reid had backed her decision to return, he and other EastEnders actors later publicly denounced the BBC's decision in a documentary about Westbrook, as they had first hand experience of Westbrook's addiction on set and were concerned for her welfare. It was reported that Westbrook underwent constant drug tests to keep her job, but at this time, her excessive use of cocaine had completely eroded away her nasal septum. In order to hide this from the audience, she was only filmed in ways that would keep her septum hidden from view. However, Westbrook's drug-use continued, and following more press speculation about her private life, the BBC announced in January 2000 that she was being axed from the soap once again. A BBC spokesman said: \"Danniella Westbrook's contract has not been renewed. Her character Sam Mitchell will move to north London, leaving the door open for her to return in the future.\" Westbrook added: \"I will always love working on EastEnders, especially with the cast. Sam's departure to north London gives me the chance to explore more opportunities.\" Speaking to London's radio station Capital 95.8, Westbrook denied she had been sacked, saying she decided to leave because she was getting married and she wanted to spend time with her husband.

The decision was made to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for \"top secret\", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed \u2013 A Year in the Life of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: \"They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [audition] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot.\" Producer Paul Annett has revealed: \"I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one.\" Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting has been described as a \"big risk\" because of this. Annett has commented, \"she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [a decade].\" Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: \"I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'.\" She added, \"It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it\". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, \"I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great.\" In an interview in 2021, Westbrook revealed that she met Medcalf at an award ceremony and thanked her for \"keeping Sam Mitchell alive\".", "Stuart Heritage, of The Guardian, commented on the recasting of Sam in June 2010, saying 'Medcalf lacked Westbrook's obvious aura of constant threat, but still managed to help bludgeon Dirty Den's head in with a metal dog before leaving so that \u2013 in a bonkers soap twist \u2013 Westbrook could return again.' Kevin O'Sullivan, writing for the Sunday Mirror, was critical of Danniella Westbrook's return in 2009, highlighting an 'inexplicable personality transplant' in Sam and decrying the 'homecoming' storyline as 'an insult to long-suffering viewers' intelligence'. Comparatively, Virgin Media have rated Sam/Westbrook's return in 2009 as the tenth greatest soap comeback of all time, saying 'She was only on screen for five seconds before the famous 'Enders drums signalled the return of Walford's much-missed Mitchell sister. It may not have been a big surprise to see Sam back, but those scriptwriters sure know how to leave us gasping for more.'", "Ruth Deller, of entertainment website lowculture.co.uk, criticised Sam's return in 2009, branding it as unsuccessful and also stating: 'Danniella Westbrook is doing her best, but the scriptwriters don't seem to know who Sam is any more. Sam mark 1 and Sam mark 2 were very different, and Sam mark 1 rebooted seems to be a third person altogether. Is she a canny businesswoman or completely thick? Is she ugly or attractive? Are we supposed to be rooting for her or rallying against her?'
