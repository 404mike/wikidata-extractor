He was given the 74-gun  in September 1801, and commanded her until February 1803, when he left the ship and was superseded by Captain William Bedford. Ferris's new command was the 74-gun , which he commissioned in February. He took her out to the West Indies, and became senior officer at Port Royal. His time in command was short-lived, he was taken ill suddenly in May 1803, and died after two days. Most remembered for his command of Hannibal during the First Battle of Algeciras, this was mentioned in most of his obituaries. Ferris also appears as a minor character in the first of the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series of nautical historical novels by Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander. He is shown meeting the character Jack Aubrey, who was based on the real-life exploits of Lord Cochrane, shortly after the First Battle of Algeciras, and is described as a former shipmate of Jack's."]}, {"page": "William Lechmere", "response": ["Lechmere took command of the 64-gun  in 1796, during which time she was the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Vandeput on the Halifax station.  He went out to Lisbon in February 1797 and there captured the Spanish privateer Atrebedo on 28 February. He moved to the 74-gun  in July 1797 and resumed his previous duties as commander of Vandeput's flagship at Halifax. He commanded Resolution until paying her off in October 1798. He then appears to have been unemployed for a period, as he is not recorded in command of a ship until April 1805, when he superseded Captain William Bedford, and commissioned the 74-gun ."]}, {"page": "William Bedford", "response": ["William Bedford may refer to:", "*William Bedford (chaplain) (1781\u20131852), Clergyman in Van Diemen's Land", "*William Bedford (footballer) (born  1861), Doncaster Rovers player", "*William Bedford (Royal Navy officer) ( 1764\u20131827), officer of the Royal Navy", "*William Bedford (basketball) (born 1963), retired NBA player"]}, {"page": "Order of battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795", "response": ["| align= left | Vice-Admiral Sir Alan GardnerCaptain William Bedford"]}, {"page": "William Bedford (admiral)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bedford (Royal Navy officer)"]}, {"page": "Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["Captain Robert Fanshawe died at Stonehall, Stonehouse, Plymouth, Devon on 4 February 1823; at which period, had he accepted his flag, he would have been the senior Admiral of the Red.
