Asbury's childhood, and especially his mother's attitudes, have been the subject of some controversy. In 1927 Herbert Asbury, a journalist who claimed to be a relative of Frances Asbury, published A Methodist Saint: The Life of Bishop Asbury, (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.). Herbert Asbury made a number of claims, quoting 'family legend' about the Asbury family, including one that Francis's mother prayed for him to become Archbishop of Canterbury, that Elizabeth claimed to have been visited by angels, and that Joseph Asbury had previously been married to a Susan Whipple, a farmer's daughter from Wednesbury. Extensive research by local historian David Hallam could find no evidence to support Herbert Asbury's claims, and dismissed his claiming relation to Francis. He noted that Asbury was a common surname in the West Midlands at the time. See Hallam (2003), pp. 14-15. Hallam dismisses a similar claim made by a \"genealogical study\" presented by an Asbury family to the Love Lane Methodist Museum in Baltimore. Francis Asbury was the only surviving child of Joseph and Elizabeth; he never married. Birth records during this period in England were of poor quality and claims of any relationship are conjecture.", "*Eliza Asbury - her cottage and her son by David Hallam () This is a meticulously researched account of Asbury's life in England and the difficult correspondence with his mother and father during their subsequent lifelong separation."]}, {"page": "Smethwick", "response": ["* David Hallam (born 1948), British Labour politician"]}, {"page": "Birmingham City University", "response": ["Current and former staff of the University and its former entities include novelists Jim Crace and Stephen Booth, nurse-author Bethann Siviter, journalist Paul Bradshaw, David Hallam Member of the European Parliament, Nigerian researcher and pollster Bell Ihua, scientist Kevin Warwick,Warwick, K, Q & A at Seminar in Birmingham City University, 20 February 2008 environmentalist Chris Baines, politicians Khalid Mahmood (MP for Perry Barr) and Lynne Jones (former MP for Selly Oak), and former Chief Inspector of Probation for England and Wales Paul McDowell."]}, {"page": "Methodist local preacher", "response": ["Local preachers have always been required to undergo some form of training and examination \u2013 the examination being concerned with their doctrinal orthodoxy as well as with their knowledge of Scripture, and the history and doctrines of the church. Because Methodism had great strength among the lower middle classes and skilled working classes in 19th-century England, training as a local preacher was one of the ways in which intelligent people who had little chance of formal schooling acquired education and an ability at public speaking. Although the church as an institution was by no means politically radical, many of its members were, and the discipline and eloquence of Methodist local preachers found a ready use in the developing labour movement of the later 19th-century.  Many of the founders of the trade union movement in Britain were local preachers, perhaps most famously four of the Tolpuddle martyrs, including their leader George Loveless.  Local preachers continue to be found in the ranks of the Labour movement: prominent recent examples include George Thomas, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983, Len Murray, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress from 1973 to 1984, David Hallam Member of the European Parliament 1994 to 1999 and, early in his career, David Blunkett, former Home Secretary.\"50 years ago: Blind local preacher bids for city council place\".
