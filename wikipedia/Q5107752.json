In 1989 he joined the Department of Geography at the University of Wales, Lampeter, holding that post for six years, until 1995. He then joined the University of Glasgow as a Professor, becoming head of the department in 2002. In 2006 Chris was replaced as Head of Department by Professor Trevor Hoey and was enlisted on the Geography and Environmental Studies RAE Sub-Panel.\nTraditionally his interests have been in the historical geographies of 'madness' and mental health and mental health care provision.  Later, he dabbled in the emerging, and increasingly significant, sub-discipline of animal geographies.  A devotee of the work of Michel Foucault, his research extended and localised Foucault's history of madness to England and Wales. Over a decade in the writing his major work was published by a minor press in Wales as A Geographical History of Institutional Provision for the Insane from Medieval Times to the 1860s in England and Wales: The Space Reserved for Insanity. Always a generous collaborator, he has co-edited numerous general anthologies of human geography. Most recently, he has examined, with Eric Laurier, cafe culture in Glasgow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Ward", "response": ["In The Child in the City (1978), and later The Child in the Country (1988), Ward \"examined the everyday spaces of young people\u2019s lives and how they can negotiate and re-articulate the various environments they inhabit. In his earlier text, the more famous of the two, Colin Ward explores the creativity and uniqueness of children and how they cultivate 'the art of making the city work'. He argued that through play, appropriation and imagination, children can counter adult-based intentions and interpretations of the built environment.  His later text, The Child in the Country, inspired a number of social scientists, notably geographer Chris Philo (1992), to call for more attention to be paid to young people as a 'hidden' and marginalised group in society.\""]}, {"page": "List of geographers", "response": ["*Chris Philo (England/Scotland, born 1960)"]}, {"page": "University of Wales, Lampeter", "response": ["*Professor Chris Philo (Geography)", "*Professor Chris Philo"]}, {"page": "Philo (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Chris Philo (born 1960), professor of geography at the University of Glasgow"]}, {"page": "Animal geography", "response": ["7.
