Along with earlier 19th-century composers such as William Sandys and John Mason Neale, Bramley and Stainer are credited with fuelling a Victorian revival of Christmas carols with their 1871 publication of Christmas Carols, New and Old, which popularised carols such as \"The First Nowell\", \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\" and \"The Holly and the Ivy\".Bramley and John Stainer published the Christmas Carols, New and Old, with a total of 20 carols, sometime in the 1860s. By 1871, the second series of 22 carols came out bringing the total to 42. A third series \u2013 with 28 carols \u2013 was issued in 1878, expanding the collection to 70 carols, second only to R. R. Chope's Carols for Use In Church in the number of carols it contained.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christmas carol", "response": ["The publication of Christmas music books in the 19th century helped to widen the popular appeal of carols. The first appearance in print of \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\", \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" was in William Sandys' 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern. Composers such as Arthur Sullivan helped to repopularise the carol, and it is this period that gave rise to such favourites as \"Good King Wenceslas\" and \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\", a New England carol written by Edmund H. Sears and Richard S. Willis. The publication in 1871 of Christmas Carols, New and Old by Henry Ramsden Bramley and Sir John Stainer was a significant contribution to a revival of carols in Victorian Britain. In 1916, Charles Lewis Hutchins published Carols Old and Carols New, a scholarly collection which suffered from a short print run and is consequently rarely available today. The Oxford Book of Carols, first published in 1928 by Oxford University Press (OUP), was a notably successful collection; edited by the British composers Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams, along with clergyman and author Percy Dearmer, it became a widely used source of carols in among choirs and church congregations in Britain and remains in print today."]}, {"page": "John Stainer", "response": ["* Christmas Carols, New and Old with Henry Ramsden Bramley (London: Novello, Ewer & Co., 1878)"]}, {"page": "The First Noel", "response": ["In common with many traditional songs and carols the lyrics vary across books.
