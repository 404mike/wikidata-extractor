The story involves a submarine commander who refuses to fire at a civilian ocean liner supposedly carrying ammunition for his country's enemies. The film was a big-budget spectacle that was compared to both The Birth of a Nation and the paintings of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet.  The film was a popular success and was credited by the Democratic National Committee with helping to re-elect Woodrow Wilson as the U.S. President in 1916. The film was also one of the first to depict Jesus Christ as a character in a motion picture, leading some to criticize the depiction as in \"poor taste.\""]}, {"page": "1972 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 29 || Edward Sloman || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 86 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| US || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "1930 in film", "response": ["*Puttin' On the Ritz, directed by Edward Sloman, starring Joan Bennett, with Technicolor sequences"]}, {"page": "Mary Augusta Ward", "response": ["*The Marriage of William Ashe, directed by Edward Sloman (1921, based on the novel The Marriage of William Ashe)"]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Edward Sloman"]}, {"page": "A Dog of Flanders", "response": ["* A Dog of Flanders (1935), directed by Edward Sloman"]}, {"page": "William Cameron Menzies", "response": ["| Edward Sloman"]}, {"page": "Kathleen Norris", "response": ["*The Luck of Geraldine Laird, directed by Edward Sloman (1920, based on the novel The Luck of Geraldine Laird)"]}, {"page": "Ivan Mosjoukine", "response": ["This basic misunderstanding of the dissimilarity between Valentino and Mosjoukine combined with journeyman direction by Edward Sloman and Mary Philbin's unresponsiveness and lack of chemistry with her leading man, consigned the film to a tepid reception by the critics and the public. Although moderately profitable, it was not the money-making hit that Laemmle expected. Mosjoukine received some good notices, but a number of critics doubted his suitability for American audiences. An even more ominous note, however, was sounded at the film's Broadway premiere on 10 October 1927. Another film, playing across the street, had its premiere four days earlier, on 6 October. The Jazz Singer was attracting much bigger audiences than Surrender and, as it was ushering in voice-on-film, would soon sound the death knell for Mosjoukine's career as a silent film star, as his heavy Russian accent eventually dealt a crippling blow to his hopes of continuing in talkies.", "*Surrender (1927, dir.
