While at Cambridge in 1942, his studies were interrupted by his service with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, serving in Europe, later on his regiment was transferred to the Middle East, in Egypt then in Palestine.

Upon Barton's retirement in June 1963, Herries became chairman and managing director of Jardines, acquiring the title of 'Tai-pan'.\nAs 'Tai-pan' of Jardines, he oversaw the group's rapid rise to become an international conglomerate.

The fare increase did not include the third class and therefore the grass roots community was largely unaffected, since the passengers of the first class deck were usually from the wealthier sector of the society. However, when the fare increase was announced by the government, it resulted in a general dissidence from the grass roots community as the Star Ferry was the only major cross-harbour public transportation at that time. The chairman of Star Ferry, M. A. R. Herries, worsened the situation when he publicly commented that \"people who do not want to pay the first class fare can simply change their mind to the third class deck\". That statement made a public outcry and was one of the blasting fuses of the Kowloon Riots afterwards."]}, {"page": "Michael Herries", "response": ["#REDIRECT M. A. R.
