Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that it is not clear whether the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about Anning's financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The \u00a325 annual pension gave Anning some financial security."]}, {"page": "Louis XVII", "response": ["* 2000 \u2013 Deborah Cadbury, The Lost King of France: A true story of revolution, revenge, and DNA, "]}, {"page": "Linacre College, Oxford", "response": ["* Deborah Cadbury, author and television producer"]}, {"page": "Seven Wonders of the Industrial World", "response": ["Seven Wonders of the Industrial World is a 7-part British docudrama television miniseries that originally aired from  to  on BBC and was later released on DVD.

The intervention of an old friend of the Duchess, Herman Rogers, against the trip, also proved unsuccessful. The government already suspected that Windsor had \"strong views on his right to intervene in affairs of state\", argues the historian Keith Middlemas, but its \"main fears\u00a0... were of indiscretion\". The Foreign Office warned the Duke that the Nazis were propaganda experts; the Duke agreed, but promised not to speak publicly while there. The government, argues the historian Deborah Cadbury, was concerned that the Duke would be able to gather a party around him and promote his own personal foreign policy, outside government control."]}]}}
