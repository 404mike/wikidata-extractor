Practical jokes and initiations for new players were commonplace; these ranged from players being stripped and forced to walk home naked to belongings being set on fire to players being tied to the roof of a car at the training ground and driven at high speeds along the A3 among a multitude of others, with long-serving midfielder Vinnie Jones saying \"you either grew a backbone quickly or dissolved as a man\", in reference to the club's boisterous culture. As the now top-flight team received more attention for their antics from the media, they also became subject to criticism from many pundits and fellow players, who accused the team of taking a \"simplified, overly aggressive, and intimidating\" approach to football in comparison to the other teams in the league. This newfound scrutiny created a close bond and tenacious camaraderie among the players, who adopted an \"us vs them\" mentality on the field as more and more opposing teams feared the side and their reputation. Players such as Vinnie Jones and John Fashanu were often accused of showing little regard for their opponents and deliberately making dangerous, risky tackles. Both received significant attention after both Gary Stevens and Gary Mabbutt of Tottenham Hotspur were injured in separate incidents following challenges from Jones and Fashanu respectively; Stevens never fully recovered from the injuries suffered as a result of Jones' tackle and retired four years later."]}, {"page": "Gary Stevens", "response": ["Gary Stevens may refer to:", "* Gary Stevens (American football) (born 1943), former American football coach", "* Gary Stevens (Australian rules footballer) (born 1972), former Sydney Swans player", "* Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1954) English footballer, played for Cardiff City and Shrewsbury Town", "* Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962) English footballer, played for Brighton and Tottenham", "* Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1963) English footballer, played for Everton and Rangers", "* Gary Stevens (jockey) (born 1963), American jockey", "* Gary Stevens (politician) (born 1941), Alaska State Senator  ", "* Gary Stevens (radio), American disc jockey in the 1960s for WMCA and Swinging Radio England", "* Gary Stevens (rugby league) (born 1944), Australian rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "Trevor Steven", "response": ["The following season, Steven further established his right-flank partnership with full back Gary Stevens, which was a strong and creative link-up. Kendall had completed his team-building process and Everton went from strength to strength, winning the First Division title for the first time in 15 years and reaching the FA Cup final again. Steven established himself as one of the best midfield players in Europe with his ability to take players on with his attacking skills combined with defensive duties when needed. The domestic \"double\" chances evaporated when Manchester United, despite being down to ten men, won at Wembley in extra time, but there was consolation for Everton when they defeated Rapid Vienna 3\u20131 in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup in Rotterdam.

Offers came in from other big clubs, including Manchester United, where Alex Ferguson was rebuilding his midfield around Bryan Robson, but Steven chose Ibrox when he exited Goodison Park in the 1989 close season. His main reason for doing so seemed to be the attraction of European football, as the ban on English clubs was ongoing and Steven had been denied the chance to play in the European Cup with Everton as a consequence. So, after 299 appearances and 60 goals, he left Everton in a \u00a31.5 million deal and went to Glasgow.", "When he was awarded his fifth cap against Italy at the beginning of a summer mini-tournament in North America, he was joined behind him by his Everton teammate Gary Stevens, therefore transferring an effective partnership to the international stage. However, Steven soon had a rival for the right flank as Robson began to explore various combinations for his wide men. Chris Waddle was a more flamboyant and explosive player than Steven, but Robson often preferred the consistency and team play of Steven on the right wing and he became a frequent choice as a result."]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 in English football", "response": ["15 September 1979: Gary Stevens, 17-year-old defender, makes his debut for First Division side Brighton and Hove Albion in a 2-0 win over Ipswich Town, at the Goldstone Ground"]}, {"page": "Jason Brown (footballer)", "response": ["In his second year at the club he was more successful, as he became a regular in the club's academy teams and with the first team he trained one-on-one with new signing Dean Kiely.

At the end of his apprenticeship, Brown was offered a one-year professional contract with Addicks for the 2000\u201301 season. However, he struggled to make an impact on the squad with four other senior goalkeepers in the team. As so he entered into talks with club manager Alan Curbishley who believed that he wouldn't continually improve as a player and thus offered to help him find a new club. Concerned about his footballing future, Brown looked for jobs elsewhere. After being recommended by Dean Kiely to Sheffield United's assistant manager Kevin Blackwell, Brown earned a trial at Bramall Lane. With the club he then featured in a friendly game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, Brown eventually wasn't offered a contract as Warnock was looking for a more experienced alternative to first choice goalkeeper Simon Tracey."]}]}}
