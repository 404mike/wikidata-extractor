Marsh once told Wogan on air that his wife was called Janet, and a series of \"Janet and John\" stories followed, read by Wogan during the breakfast show. These were a pastiche of children's learn-to-read stories, with humorous sexual double-entendres, which often led to Wogan and Marsh breaking into laughter. Six CDs and two books of the stories have been sold in aid of Children in Need, raising over \u00a34 million. A long-running campaign by Wogan criticising the British government for levying VAT on the CDs eventually led to a government rebate of \u00a3200,000. Another feature of the programme was Wogan's exchanges with \"the Totty from Splotty\" \u2013 Lynn Bowles, the Welsh traffic reporter from Splott, Cardiff \u2013 which often involved reading limericks from listeners cut short after one or two lines, as risqu\u00e9 innuendo in the later lines was telegraphed."]}, {"page": "Chris Evans (presenter)", "response": ["Evans took over the Radio 2 breakfast show on 11 January 2010, succeeding Sir Terry Wogan. The show was originally 30 minutes longer than the Wogan incarnation and began at 07:00\u00a0am, but following the departure of Sarah Kennedy from early breakfast, the show was extended by another 30 minutes and began at 06:30\u00a0am. The show always ended with a handover to Ken Bruce at 09:30\u00a0am. While Evans replaced Wogan owing to his long-planned retirement, supporters of Kennedy alleged there was a deliberate intention to force her out so that Evans' show could be lengthened. His first three songs were The Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\" and \"Got to Get You into My Life\"; and Frank Sinatra's \"Come Fly with Me\". His co-presenters included ex-BBC TV newsreader Moira Stuart, sports presenter Jonny Saunders (who was replaced in June 2011 by Vassos Alexander), and travel reporter Lynn Bowles.
