The year 1907 saw the publication of the essay Angylion yr Aelwyd (Angels in the Home) which she had written in 1899. Now a member of the Undeb Dirwestol Merched y De (UDMD), the South Wales Women's Temperance Union, her article criticized men's arguments for keeping women out of parliament. The same year she also published Murmur y Gragen. Sef detholion o gyfansoddiadau barddonol a rhyddiaethol (Murmur of the Shell: Selection of Poetry and Prose).In her A View Across the Valley: Short Stories by Women from Wales (1899), Jane Aaron describes Hughes as \"arguably the Welsh-language author of the period who comes closest to being a feminist in the modern sense\". Covering her contributions to the journal Y Gymraes (The Welsh Woman) in 1900, she quotes a passage in which Hughes mocks William Gladstone, the prime minister of the day: \"The idea that an elder of the wisdom of Mr Gladstone should doubt the capacity of the majority of women to vote in an election strikes us as wonderfully astonishing!\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["* Ellen Hughes (1867\u20131927) \u2013 Welsh writer, poet, suffragist"]}, {"page": "Hughes (surname)", "response": ["*Ellen Hughes (1867\u20131927), Welsh writer and suffragist"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women writers", "response": ["*Ellen Hughes (1867\u20131927), Welsh-language writer, poet and suffragist"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Ellen Hughes (1867\u20131927), Welsh-language writer, suffragist, temperance reformer"]}, {"page": "Hughes, Ellen", "response": ["#redirectEllen Hughes"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (A\u2013L)", "response": ["*Ellen Hughes (1867\u20131927, Wales), poet, es. & suffragist"]}]}}
