As a result, the Southern League Management Committee paid a \u00a3100 subsidy to each of the five English clubs in the league. Of the previous season's professional players, only goalkeeper Ted Price, full backs Tommy Fells and Walter Spratt, centre half Frank Bentley and outside left Patsy Hendren were retained. Bill Smith, Frederick Chapple and Bob McTavish were sold for small fees, while left half Phil Richards elected to retire. In came half backs Tom McGovern, Bobby Jackson and forwards Charlie Elliott, Henry Simons, Joe Johnson and Tommy Clark. England international amateur right half Alec Barclay remained with the club and amateur forwards Henry White and Jack Chapman were added to the ranks.", "|Jack Chapman", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jack Chapman", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jack Chapman", "| Jack Chapman", "| Jack Chapman"]}]}}
