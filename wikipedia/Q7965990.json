He also played first-class cricket for The Players (1881-1883), the Rest of England (1883), the North of England (1883), R.G. Barlow's XI (1883) and an England XI (1884).\nBorn in Greetland, Elland, Yorkshire, England, Robinson was a right-handed batsman, who scored 3,902 runs at 19.31, with a highest score of 154 against Oxford University.  His three other centuries were scored against Yorkshire, Middlesex and Kent.  He took 52 catches and, bowling right arm, round arm medium pace, conceded 61 runs without taking a wicket.\nHe learnt his cricket in Yorkshire, but first played as a professional in Lancashire, with Haslingden C.C. in 1873 and 1874. In 1875, he was engaged by Cliffe End C.C., Longwood, near Huddersfield and, in 1876 and 1877, at Bacup C.C.  Yorkshire gave him a chance during 1876 and 1877, but he found little success.  He moved to the Littleborough C.C., in Lancashire, in 1878 where he stayed until 1885, qualifying to play for Lancashire County Cricket Club by residence.  He played 115 matches for them from 1880 to 1888. In 1886, he was back at Haslingden for a year and then moved to Colne C.C. (1887\u201390), before taking up an engagement at St Helens Recreation C.C., where he stayed until 1898. His last known engagement was at Prescot C.C.\nRobinson died in August 1919.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Robinson", "response": ["Walter Robinson may refer to:", "* Walter Robinson (cricketer) (1851\u20131919), English cricketer", "* Walter Robinson (baseball) (born 1908), American Negro leagues baseball player", "* Walter Robinson (bishop) (1919\u20131975), Anglican Bishop of Dunedin", "* Walter Robinson (artist) (born 1950), American art critic and artist", "* Walter Robinson (composer), African American composer"]}, {"page": "Henry Hall (Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["Hall, a lower-order batsman and a bowler whose bowling style is unknown, has the distinction of taking the first wicket ever taken by Somerset in an authenticated first-class match when he had Lancashire opening batsman and captain Albert Hornby caught in the match at Old Trafford on 8 June 1882, and he followed it with a catch to dismiss the second Lancashire batsman, Walter Robinson. There were no other successes for Hall in this game: no more catches, wickets or runs when he batted and he then did not play against for Somerset in any first-class fixture for three years. By the time he reappeared for a single game in 1885 against Gloucestershire, whose team included W. G. Grace, he was being played as an opening batsman: to no great effect, as he scored 0 and 2 and Somerset lost very heavily. Though Hall went on to play minor matches for a further 10 years, this was his last first-class cricket game."]}]}}
