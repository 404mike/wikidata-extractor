He is currently the diary editor, and was previously a sports writer, for The Times, where he has been working since 2001, and whose website hosts his Line and Length, \"A very English cricket blog\".  He also appears frequently in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and The Wisden Cricketer, and is a regular radio and television pundit.  His first book, Best of Enemies: Whingeing Poms Versus Arrogant Aussies, was released in early 2009. A second book, The Worst of Rugby, was published later that year.\nHe also writes a light-hearted personal blog, The Questing Vole, about politics, history, culture and sport, in which he describes himself as \"a 1920s eccentric trapped in the body of a 21st-century journalist. Not a very fetching body, either.\" The blog takes its name from the opening of Scoop, Evelyn Waugh's satire on journalism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Savile Club", "response": ["*Patrick Kidd"]}, {"page": "Test Match Sofa", "response": ["Guests on the show have included cricketers John Barclay, Martin Bicknell, Iain O'Brien, Rikki Clarke, John Emburey, Laurie Evans, Graeme Fowler, Angus Fraser, Ed Giddins, Greg Matthews, Tim Murtagh, Ollie Rayner, Shaun Tait and Claire Taylor.

They also chose not to include Kevin Pietersen, who had announced his intention to leave the club. Hampshire's chairman, Rod Bransgrove, explained the omission of Pietersen: \"it would not be fair on the lads who took Hampshire into the Twenty20 finals if one of them had to step aside so he could be parachuted into the team.\" Patrick Kidd of The Times rated James Vince as Hampshire's most dangerous batsman, though his team-mate Jimmy Adams entered Finals' Day as the competition's leading run-scorer, with 600 runs. Wisden Cricketers' Almanacks Hugh Chevallier rated them as the weakest of the four teams to reach the semi-finals, and The Times concurred, giving them the joint-longest odds of any finalists; 7\u20132."]}]}}
