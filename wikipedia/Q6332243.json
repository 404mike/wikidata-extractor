Rak was home to  artists such as Herman's Hermits, Suzi Quatro, Mud, Kenny, Hot Chocolate, Smokie, Arrows, Span, Racey and Kim Wilde. Rak Records were distributed via a licensing deal with EMI Records, which bought the company and its master recordings from Most in 1983. Most kept the company name and his RAK Studios, which still exists in St. John's Wood along with Rak Publishing. The latter company represents artists such as Joan Jett, Ben Taylor and KK. In 1986, Most defected the label from EMI to PRT Records which handled the last releases until February 1988. Owing to the records not being hits, the label folded.  However, 26 years later in late 2014, Rak Records was revived as a label for new artists releasing both downloads and 7-inch vinyl in the form of a singles club. The Cadbury Sisters, Trojanhorse, and Beautiful Boy were the new signings. They recorded their own original songs as the A-sides, and covered a classic Rak artists cover as the B-side. The Cadbury Sisters covered Steve Harley's 1975 classic \"Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)\" (even though it was originally released on the generic EMI label), Trojan Horse did Cozy Powell's \"Dance With The Devil\", and Beautiful Boy did \"Kids In America\". As PRT Records is no longer in existence, the label is now distributed by Gearbox Records using the original sailing yacht paper label and the records packaged in the original royal blue paper sleeves."]}, {"page": "Pleased to Meet You (James album)", "response": ["Pleased to Meet You is the ninth studio album by English rock band James. Less than a year after the release of Millionaires (1999), the band were playing new material live. Recording was split between Ridge Farm, Whitfield St., House in the Woods studios; producer credit was split between Brian Eno, guitarist/violinist Saul Davies, KK and the band. \"Getting Away with It (All Messed Up)\" was released as a single in late June, followed a week later by Pleased to Meet You on 2 July through Mercury Records.", "Inspired by playing the new songs live, the band decided to gather in a circle and record live-in-the-studio at Ridge Farm Studios with engineer Gary Langan. Eno likened the process to when artists make their debut record: \"they're full of enthusiasm and excitement and they know what they're doing and it's a pleasure.\" Additional production was done by KK, at the suggestion of Eno, and drummer David Baynton-Power. All of the songs recorded here were mixed by Dave Bascombe at Whitfield St. Studios. The remainder of the tracks were credited to different producers: \"Falling Down\" by Eno and KK; \"The Shining\", \"Give It Away\" and \"Getting Away with It (All Messed Up)\" by James and Eno; \"Gaudi\" by James and Baynton-Power; \"What Is It Good For\" by James; \"Fine\" by James, Eno and KK; and \"Alaskan Pipeline\" by James. Bascombe did additional recording and engineering at Whitfield.", "\"The Shining\", \"Getting Away with It (All Messed Up)\" and \"Alaskan Pipeline\" were engineered by James Loughrey. \"The Shining\", \"Senorita\", \"Gaudi\", \"What Is It Good For\" and \"Getting Away with It (All Messed Up)\" were recorded at House in the Woods. \"Gaudi\" was engineered by Tim Pettit and Baynton-Power. \"What Is It Good For\" was engineered by Pettit and mixed by him, James and Bascombe at House in the Woods and Whitfield. KK did additional recording for it and \"Getting Away with It (All Messed Up)\". \"Fine\" was engineered by Loughrey and KK, with additional engineering by Simon Changer. The sessions concluded in January 2001; the recording days consisted of 18-hour periods. Most of the finished album was made up from live takes and demos that were made before recording with Eno. Mixing began in late January 2001 and finished in March.", "\"Space\" begins as a Radiohead-esque track with an electro intro before shifting into chorus sections in the vein of Simple Minds. In the context of the song's pre-chorus, Booth said that \"[s]cientifically we are made up of about 96% space,\" which he found interesting. Discussing \"Falling Down\", Booth said after recording a jam with Eno, it was given to KK. He edited the track; after giving Booth a copy, he re-did the vocal take, resulting in the final version. The lyrics refer to a mad, eccentric woman coming into power. The bass part was compared to the one heard in \"Material Girl\" by Madonna. \"English Beefcake\" stars a man who ends relationships, while being hesitant in causing pain as a result of them. The song's first verse describes pain and misunderstanding that arises in relationships. \"Junkie\" talks about compulsive behaviour, and sees Booth singing through an answerphone. Booth compared \"The Shining\" to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' \"The Ship Song\" (1990).", "* KKproducer (tracks 2 and 9), engineer (track 9), additional recording (track 10)"]}, {"page": "Hey Ma (album)", "response": ["In September 2007, James travelled to France with Lee Muddy Baker, who had previously worked with Booth, co-producing Bone. By this point, they had accumulated 120 pieces of music for the album. The members built their own studios at the Ch\u00e2teau de Warsy in France. The set-up consisted of a main studio as well as personal studios for each member in their rooms. It allowed each member to constantly feed ideas back to Baker in the main studio, and jam at their leisure. Producer credit was split between Baker and the band. Ben Caro served as the engineer, while KK aided with vocal engineering. Sessions continued into December 2007; after returning to the UK, \"Whiteboy\" was recorded at Hotspur Press in Manchester, \"72\" at The Premises in Hoxton, and \"I Wanna Go Home\" at Scream in Brighton.", "* KKprogramming", "* KKvocal engineer"]}, {"page": "KK (Kevin Kerrigan)", "response": ["#REDIRECT KK (composer, producer)"]}]}}
