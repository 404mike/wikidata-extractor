The Eden Court Theatre was formally opened on 15 April 1976 by Andrew Cruickshank MBE, an actor best known for his portrayal of Dr Cameron in BBC's long-running series \"Dr Finlay's Casebook\". It was built on a site next to the Ness river and incorporated the gothic Bishop's Palace residence (from which it took its name) into a new building designed by architects Law Dunbar and Naismith.  The theatre was at that time a revolution to Inverness, and the wider Highland Region.  It provided modern theatre performance space for the first time since the early '30s.  Inverness had previously had a number of theatres including the Theatre Royal, previously situated on Bank street which burnt down in 1934 The Highland Council - Highland History & culture and the Empire Theatre on Academy Street. This theatre had originally opened as The Central Hall Picture House in 1912, but after the Theatre Royal burnt down, it was converted to a fully functioning theatre and reopened as the Empire around 1934.  The building was designed by A. Ross & Son and was eventually demolished in 1971.  Many famous names performed at this popular venue - Harry Lauder, Renee Houston and Calum Kennedy The Corries, Alastair Gillies, to name a few.  Today the modern Penta Hotel  building stands in its place.  A theatre originally built as an Opera House, with full stage facilities, by the name of The Playhouse also existed in Inverness situated on Academy Street, in the  town centre. It was built by Alexander B King the cinema magnate, and it was one of the flagship cinemas of Caledonian Associated Cinemas Ltd (CAC) who operated out of Inverness.  The Playhouse staged occasional shows but was principally a cinema seating 1429, and had a proscenium opening of 45 feet, but  the only opera ever presented there was by the local Amateur Operatic Society after the Empire Theatre was demolished. The building also hosted the Gaelic Mod with live performances being transmitted by BBC Scotland on Television.  Andy Stewart used to put on his show there, as well as at other CAC venues all over Scotland including the Lyceum at Dumfries, and the Playhouse in Perth. The Playhouse was set on fire by an arsonist in 1972 and was later demolished to make way for the new Eastgate Shopping Development."]}, {"page": "Fiona Kennedy", "response": ["Fiona Kennedy Clark, OBE, DL is a Scottish singer, actress, and broadcaster, and the daughter of Scottish and Gaelic singers Calum Kennedy and Anne Gillies.
