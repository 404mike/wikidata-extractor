Weinberg thus became a local child star, drumming in a three-piece mohair suit. He gained an appreciation for showmanship and was a fan of Liberace and Sammy Davis, Jr. He grew to idolize drummer Buddy Rich and become a fan of Gene Krupa and saw drummer Ed Shaughnessy of Doc Severinsen's band on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson as having an ideal job as well as admiring the level of playing and serious sartorial style of the Tonight Show musicians.

At Acton County, he was frequently bullied because he had a large nose, an experience that profoundly affected him. His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model. Though his father taught him a couple of chords, Townshend was largely self-taught on the instrument and never learned to read music. Townshend and school friend John Entwistle formed a short-lived trad jazz group, the Confederates, featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns. The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club, a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church, and covered Acker Bilk, Kenny Ball, and Lonnie Donegan. However, both became influenced by the increasing popularity of rock 'n' roll, with Townshend particularly admiring Cliff Richard's debut single, \"Move It\". Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the group's drummer, Chris Sherwin, and purchased a \"reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar\" at his mother's antique shop."]}, {"page": "1962 in music", "response": ["*The Best of Ball, Barber And Bilk \u2013 Kenny Ball, Chris Barber, and Acker Bilk"]}, {"page": "1961 in music", "response": ["* Stranger on the Shore \u2013 Acker Bilk"]}, {"page": "1929 in music", "response": ["*January 28 \u2013 Mr Acker Bilk, English jazz clarinetist (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "Oxford Street", "response": ["The 100 Club, in the basement of No.\u00a0100, has been run as a live music venue since 24 October 1942.
