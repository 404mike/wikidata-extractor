When Hunt had problems, Sunbeam's Charlie Dodson moved into the lead. Interest then began to focus on Tyrell-Smith, who, riding furiously, was making up time on the leaders. Dodson won, with his teammate Alec Bennett more than four minutes behind, and Tyrell-Smith only 50 seconds behind him, taking third.

His father was a big sports entheusiast and growing up, he loved playing sports himself. He was also a big fan of his local football club Oxford United, whom he supports to this day. While his parents were not very interested in motorcycle racing or racing in general, Harris' interest for motorcycle racing was first sparked when he first saw motocross races on his parents' black-and-white television. This is also where he first saw Isle of Man TT winner Graham Walker and his son Murray Walker, who started his commentator career around this time. When he discovered the Motorcycle speedway at the Oxford Stadium in Cowley and later visited Mallory Park with his father, where he saw and heard the six-cylinder Honda of Mike Hailwood for the first time, this interest was further sparked."]}]}}
