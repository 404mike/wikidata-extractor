He was rapidly promoted, and by the end of the decade was overseeing the Perthshire and Dundee editions of the People's Journal. In 1911, he moved to the London office of the Dundee Advertiser, then the London office of the Glasgow Herald. During World War I, he served with the King's Royal Rifle Corps.At the end of the war, Gordon took work with the Evening News, then in 1922 he moved to become Chief Sub-editor of the Daily Express. Editor Beverley Baxter promised to increase his wages, but forgot, and Gordon resigned. However, owner Lord Beaverbrook was keen to retain Gordon, and appointed him editor of the Sunday Express in 1928. Between 1928 and 1952, Gordon raised circulation of the Sunday Express from 450,000 to 3.2 million. In 1930, he commissioned R. H. Naylor to write a horoscope for the birth of Princess Margaret. This proved popular, and Gordon retained it as a regular feature - the first regular newspaper horoscope.In 1952, Gordon was made editor-in-chief of the paper, and all real editorial power was removed from him. He instead focussed on writing a newspaper column covering current events. In one column in 1953 he criticised Sir John Gielgud, who had been fined \u00a310 by magistrates for importuning, and saw the incident as an example of \"moral rot\" and suggested such \"social lepers\" should be completely ignored.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Daily Express", "response": [":1928: James Douglas and John Gordon", ":1931: John Gordon"]}, {"page": "Morgan Academy", "response": ["* John Gordon, Editor from 1928-52 of the Sunday Express, and President from 1948-9 of the Institute of Journalists"]}, {"page": "John Gordon", "response": ["* John Gordon (trombonist) (born 1939), American jazz trombonist", "* John Gordon (scenic artist) (c. 1874\u20131911), in Australia, son of George Gordon", "* John Gordon (songwriter) (born 1963), Australian singer-songwriter and music producer", "* John Gordon (author) (1925\u20132017), English writer of teenage supernatural fiction", "* John Gordon (militia captain) (1759\u20131819), American Appalachian pioneer and Indian fighter", "* John Gordon (Royal Navy officer) (1792\u20131869), courtmartialled after HMS America incident", "* John Gordon, Lord Gordon (died 1517), Scottish nobleman", "* John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland (1525\u20131567), Scottish magnate", "* John Gordon, 1st Viscount of Kenmure (1599\u20131634), Scottish nobleman and founder of the town of New Galloway", "* John Gordon, 14th Earl of Sutherland (1609\u20131679), Scottish peer", "* Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, of Haddo (1610\u20131644), Scottish Royalist supporter of Charles I", "* Sir John Gordon, 2nd Baronet, of Haddo (died 1665)", "* John Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aboyne (died 1732)", "* John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland (1661\u20131733), Scottish nobleman and politician", "* John Gordon, 7th/10th Viscount of Kenmure (1750\u20131840), Viscount of Kenmure", "* John Gordon (Aberdeen MP) (c. 1655\u20131730), Scottish MP 1708\u20131710", "* John Gordon (soldier) (c. 1776\u20131858), MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis", "* John Gordon (South Londonderry MP) (1849\u20131922), Irish MP 1900\u20131916", "* John Gordon (Conservative politician) (1850\u20131915), MP for Elginshire and Nairnshire, 1895\u20131906, and Brighton, 1911\u20131914", "* John Gordon (Victorian politician) (1858\u20131937), Australian politician", "* John Gordon (union leader), president of Public Service Alliance of Canada", "* John Gordon (archbishop) (1912\u20131981), Irish diplomat of the Holy See", "* John Gordon (bishop) (1544\u20131619), Scottish bishop and Dean of Salisbury", "* John Gordon (priest) (1726\u20131793), Anglican priest", "* John Gordon (rugby union) (1849\u20131934), Scottish international rugby union player", "* John Gordon (Scottish footballer) (1886\u20131971), Scottish footballer", "* John Gordon (referee) (1930\u20132000), Scottish football referee", "* John Gordon (sportscaster) (born 1940), American radio announcer for the Minnesota Twins Major League baseball team", "* John Gordon (badminton) (born 1978), New Zealand badminton player", "* John Gordon (cricketer) (1886\u20131933), English cricketer", "* John Gordon (Jamaican cricketer) (born 1956), Jamaican cricketer", "* John Gordon (curler) (born 1958), American Olympic curler", "* John Gordon (merchant) (c. 1710\u20131778), British Loyalist merchant and trader of Scottish origin", "* John Gordon (convict) (died 1845), last person executed by Rhode Island", "* John Gordon (anatomist) (1786\u20131818), Scottish physician and anatomist", "* John Gordon (journalist) (1890\u20131974), Scottish newspaper editor and columnist"]}, {"page": "John Rutherford Gordon", "response": ["Gordon was born in Gilberton, a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia, the son of the politician David John Gordon.

Eventually, at the very end of 1955, Graham Greene, in the London Sunday Times, called it one of the three best books of 1955. This statement provoked a response from the London Sunday Express, whose editor John Gordon called it \"the filthiest book I have ever read\" and \"sheer unrestrained pornography.\" British Customs officers were then instructed by the Home Office to seize all copies entering the United Kingdom. In December 1956, France followed suit, and the Minister of the Interior banned Lolita; the ban lasted for two years. Its eventual British publication by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in London in 1959 was controversial enough to contribute to the end of the political career of the Conservative member of parliament Nigel Nicolson, one of the company's partners.Laurence W.

In gratitude for Crawford's service, Queen Mary, the princesses' grandmother, decorated the house with Victorian furniture and prints of flowers for her. Crawford left the cottage in 1950 in the aftermath of her selling stories about the royal family to newspapers, which was revealed publicly by The Sunday Express editor John Gordon in an attempt to pressure her to provide more stories and articles to him."]}]}}
