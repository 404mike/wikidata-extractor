However, after a near perfect August, September was to prove something of a reality check for the Gulls.  With Torquay's clean sheet record ending against Port Vale in their previous match, a 2\u20131 defeat away to Southend in their first game of the month put to an end a twelve match unbeaten run in the League which had stretched back to March.  This was then followed up by two successive 0\u20130 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage.  Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net.  With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were starting to look a little light up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.", "With over 5,000 supporters struggling to get through the Plainmoor turnstiles for the match with Crawley, there was a fifteen-minute delay to the kick off to what turned out to be an ill-tempered Fourth Round tie.  Torquay found it hard to get a foothold in the first half of the game and eventually fell behind in the 39th minute to a Matt Tubbs strike.  However, worse was to follow in the second period when Chris Zebroski was sent off in the 61st minute for a second bookable offence after a handball in the six yard box.  However, when keeper Scott Bevan managed to save the resulting penalty from Tubbs, the Gulls spirits were raised again until another penalty was awarded to Crawley just minutes later.  Astonishingly, Bevan pulled off his second penalty save of the match, this time from Craig McAllister, to give Torquay another lifeline.  Unfortunately, they were unable to capitalise on Bevan's heroics and, despite the sending off of Dean Howell for Crawley in the 83rd minute, the score remained 1\u20130 until the final whistle.  In a match which saw seven bookings in addition to the two dismissals, many Torquay supporters were angered by the tactics employed by Crawley manager Steve Evans (two of Crawley's yellow cards were for time wasting) and their misery was compounded the following day when Evans\u2019 men were rewarded with a trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United in the Fifth Round draw.", "In a month with a punishing eight matches to be played, Torquay had to be at full strength if they were to make any kind of push for promotion.  With that in mind, Paul Buckle once again dipped into the loan market.  Although current loanee Ryan Gilligan unfortunately had to make an early return to Northampton following a family bereavement, Buckle was able to make an immediate replacement in the form of young Derby midfielder Ben Pringle.  Shortly afterwards, Plainmoor also saw the arrival of two loan strikers in Ronan Murray from Ipswich Town and Gavin Tomlin of Dagenham & Redbridge.   With Buckle eventually negotiating for both forwards to remain with Torquay until the end of the season, the Gulls now had a variety of attacking options with the likes of Jake Robinson, Chris Zebroski, Eunan O\u2019Kane and Billy Kee already causing problems to opposition defences.", "Easter Monday's trip to Burton saw Torquay find their shooting boots again with Chris Zebroski and Gavin Tomlin putting the Gulls 2\u20130 up within the first 15 minutes.  However, not for the first time this season, Torquay managed to surrender a two-goal lead and had to rely on a stunning 78th-minute strike from Billy Kee to rescue a point in a thrilling 3\u20133 draw.  This was a result which left Torquay just outside the play-offs with two games remaining.  The penultimate game of the league campaign was a Friday night encounter at home to champions-elect Chesterfield.  Over 5,000 supporters witnessed yet another 0\u20130 draw which was also Craig Stanley's last game before having to return to parent club Morecambe.  Stanley was perhaps one of Paul Buckle's most successful loan signings and many Gulls fans were hopeful that the midfielder would make a return to Plainmoor next season.  The significance of the Chesterfield draw was only fully felt the following day with Gillingham and Stevenage both losing their matches.  This meant all three teams would go into the final day of the season tied on 68 points with just two play-off spots remaining, although Torquay's superior goal difference left them in pole position.  The Gulls now had to travel to Rotherham knowing they only had to equal or better the Gillingham and Stevenage results in order to guarantee a place in the play-offs.", "As the last day of the regular season arrived, and with Torquay, Stevenage and Gillingham separated only by goal difference, it was vital for the Gulls to do everything they could in their match with Rotherham to ensure they secured one of the two remaining play-off berths.  However, it was to prove a challenging afternoon at the Don Valley Stadium.  Nerves began to jangle as soon as Ryan Taylor put the Millers 1\u20130 ahead after just ten minutes and, despite Chris Zebroski equalising in the 31st minute, Rotherham restored their lead just two minutes later thanks to a Danny Harrison strike. Meanwhile, with goals going in at the Stevenage and Gillingham games, Torquay found themselves in 6th, 7th and 8th position at various times during the afternoon and, when Oliver Banks put Rotherham 3\u20131 ahead in the 80th minute, they were now relying on scores from elsewhere if they were to book a place in the play-offs.  While Stevenage secured their place with an enthralling 3\u20133 draw against Bury, the Gulls were ultimately indebted to Chesterfield who, by beating Gillingham 3\u20131, not only clinched the League Two title for themselves, but also made sure that Torquay would finish the season in the final play-off spot, ahead of the unfortunate Gills on goal difference alone.", "Torquay's play-off semi-final opponents turned out to be Shrewsbury who missed out on automatic promotion by just one point.  With the first leg at Plainmoor in front of the Sky Sports cameras, the Shrews were no doubt mindful of the 5\u20130 thrashing they had received at the Gulls\u2019 home ground just two months previously.  The fact that two of those goals came from Jake Robinson (on loan from Shrewsbury) added extra spice to the tie, particularly as there was no clause preventing Robinson from playing against his parent club in the play-offs.  Despite Robinson not getting on the score sheet, Torquay produced an assured performance which saw them comfortably win the first leg 2\u20130 thanks to goals from Chris Zebroski and Eunan O\u2019Kane.  The Gulls had to make sure they finished off the job in the return leg and that is exactly what they did with a 0\u20130 draw at the New Meadow.  The draw meant that Torquay United had done enough to ensure their place in the play-off final where the opponents would be their old Conference rivals Stevenage, who secured their own spot thanks to a 3\u20130 aggregate win over Accrington Stanley.", "While the new signings did much to assure Torquay's fans, more disappointment came with the news that top goalscorer Chris Zebroski had handed in a transfer request.  With still no goalkeeper and pre-season friendlies just around the corner, it was clear that Martin Ling and Torquay United still had much work to do before the arrival of the new season.", "|1 || FW ||  || 26 || Chris Zebroski || 15 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 15", "|26 ||  || FW || Chris Zebroski || 9 || 0 || 2 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 12 || 1"]}, {"page": "2008 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|FW ||26 || Chris Zebroski"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["*  \u2013 Chris Zebroski joins Bristol Rovers for an undisclosed fee from fellow South West outfit Torquay United.", "| Chris Zebroski", "|align=\"left\"|26||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Chris Zebroski", "|  Chris Zebroski"]}, {"page": "2011 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Torquay United's opponents for their play-off semi-final were Shrewsbury Town with the first match of the two-legged tie taking place at Plainmoor in Torquay on 14 May 2011.
