He also played for Scottish side as the Queen of the South. He later played non-League football for King's Lynn, Cambridge United, Stamford, Wisbech Town, Diss Town, Mildenhall Town, Newmarket Town, Bourne Town and Spalding United.On 20 May 2015 he was appointed as manager of United Counties League side Boston Town, but left the club in February 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["In preparation for 1998\u201399, he signed athletic Derby centre-back Matt Carbon for \u00a3800,000, Blackpool striker James Quinn for \u00a3500,000, and Manchester City defender Jason van Blerk for \u00a350,000. He also brought in winger Mark Angel, midfielders Mario Bortolazzi and Enzo Maresca, and striker Fabian de Freitas. However, the player who had the greatest impact for West Brom was young striker Lee Hughes, who had been signed before Smith's arrival but only made his first start under Smith. Aside from Maresca, many of Smith's signings had little impact, and supporters criticised him for allowing popular goalkeeper Alan Miller and strikers Andy Hunt and Bob Taylor to leave the club. West Brom started the season well with Hughes in tremendous form, but a slump in form in March 1999 left them ending up in 12th place. Smith was dismissed on 27 July 1999, just a week before the start of 1999\u20132000."]}, {"page": "Angel (surname)", "response": ["* Mark Angel (footballer)", "* Mark Angel (comedian)"]}, {"page": "Mark Angel", "response": ["Mark Angel may refer to:", "* Mark Angel (footballer) (born 1975), English footballer", "* Mark Angel (comedian) (born 1991), Nigerian comedian, scriptwriter, and video producer"]}]}}
