He was educated at Sedbergh School and Clare College, Cambridge.  After obtaining his degree he joined the family businesses, Cearns and Brown Ltd and the United Mersey Supply Company, both of which were chandlers and ships\u2019 suppliers in the Port of Liverpool.Stoddart was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Auxiliary Air Force with No. 611 Squadron at Speke on 18 December 1936. He learned to fly in Avro Tutors then graduated to Hawker Harts and later Hinds before converting to the Spitfire Mk I in May 1939. He was at summer camp at RAF Duxford Cambridgeshire when war was declared.  By January 1940 he was a flight lieutenant and commanded 'B' Flight at Digby.\nHe took part in operations over the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940. Stoddart was flying Spitfire I N3058 when he was hit by a cannon shell in the fuselage just behind his seat, which tore a large hole in the side of the fuselage and blew the canopy off. The armour plating was hit and control cables were almost severed. However, F/L Stoddart managed to force land at Martlesham Heath.\nHe flew with the squadron during the Battle of Britain.  No. 611 was held in reserve for much of the Battle of Britain but saw finally action on 11 September when Stoddart attacked a Bf 109 at long range, firing 1,784 rounds without observed result. He made no claims with 611 Squadron.\nHe was seen as:\na glamorous figure with an aquiline nose, whose insouciant manner and casual references to \"prangs\" and drinking Pimms, while waiting for comrades to return, masked his true heroism and steely resolve.\nHe was promoted to the rank of squadron leader on 1 January 1944.After leaving the RAF, Stoddart became a public servant. He became a Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire in 1958, and was appointed High Sheriff of Merseyside from 1974-1975.  From 1979 to 1989, he was Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside.  He retained links with the RAF by becoming Wing President of the Merseyside Air Cadet Organisation.\nIn 1940, he married Jean Young (appointed OBE, 2015) and they had two daughters, Jennifer and Charlotte.\nA memorial service for Sir Kenneth was held at Liverpool Cathedral at noon on 12 February 2009.", "link_mentions": {}}}
