He was the second son of John Butler, 17th Earl of Ormonde and Frances Susan Elizabeth Wandesford. He was born at Kilkenny castle on 15 July 1774.\nButler was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilkenny City in the Irish House of Commons in 1796 (he never took his seat and resigned after 3 months) and served then for Kilkenny County until the Act of Union in 1801. He sat subsequently for the Irish county constituency of County Kilkenny and was member of the UK House of Commons from 1801, until he succeeded to the peerage, as 19th Earl of Ormonde, in 1820, on the death of his elder brother, Walter, the 18th Earl and 1st Marquess of Ormonde in the Irish peerage (the latter title becoming extinct upon his death). He was a well known advocate for the Irish people with his first speech at Westminster condemning the Irish Window tax and defending the right of Irish landowners.\nHaving joined fashionable society in London, he became a companion of the Prince Regent. Subsequently, at the Prince's coronation as George IV, he was created a Peer of the United Kingdom, as Baron Ormonde, of Llanthony, in the county of Monmouth and in 1825, Marquess of Ormonde.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Butler", "response": ["*James Butler, 1st Marquess of Ormonde (1777\u20131838)"]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Kilkenny", "response": ["*James Butler, 1st Marquess of Ormonde \u20131831The Royal Kalendar for 1831, p. 389.", "*James Butler, 1st Marquess of Ormonde 7 October 1831 \u2013 18 May 1838"]}, {"page": "John Butler, 2nd Marquess of Ormonde", "response": ["He was the son of James Butler, 1st Marquess of Ormonde and Grace Louisa Staples.
