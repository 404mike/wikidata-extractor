He is currently an assistant first team coach at the club.\nHighly rated as a central defender, in 2009 he was named by The Times as Tottenham's 25th best player of all time. From 2002 to 2010, King made 21 international appearances for England, scoring twice and representing the nation at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn the latter part of his career, King was plagued by chronic knee problems, for which no effective treatment or remedy was found. Instead of training with the rest of the squad King undertook fitness exercises on his own, allowing him to play one first team game per week. His former manager Harry Redknapp called King \"an absolute freak\" for being able to perform at Premier League level despite not training. Whilst playing, King was cited by opponents and pundits as one of the best defenders in the Premier League.King announced his retirement from all forms of football on 19 July 2012 as a result of the chronic knee injuries that plagued much of his career. In August 2020, King was appointed assistant first team coach to work alongside Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and other coaching staff at Tottenham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 12", "response": ["*1980 \u2013 Ledley King, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1980", "response": ["* October 12 \u2013 Ledley King, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.", "response": ["|Club ambassador|| Ledley King"]}, {"page": "Stepney", "response": ["Others born in Stepney are entertainer Des O'Connor, actor Steven Berkoff, Steven Berkoff: The real East Enders, The Independent 4 January 2007 accessed 10 May 2007 playwright Arnold Wesker, gardener Rachel De Thame, television executive Alan Yentob, artist Frank Paton, drummer Kenney Jones, musician and writer Jah Wobble,Jah Wobble, Memoirs of a Geezer, p. 1. singer Kenny Lynch and his sister Maxine Daniels, singer Charles Coborn, footballers Ledley King, Ashley Cole, Mark Lazarus and Darren Purse, Heavyweight boxer \"Bombardier\" Billy Wells, former armed robber and businessman Roy Shaw, former British featherweight boxing champion Sammy McCarthy, sportswriter Norman Giller, and Labour politician Wes Streeting."]}, {"page": "SuperCupNI", "response": ["* Ledley King (Tottenham Hotspur) 1996, 1997 (U16)"]}, {"page": "List of Eastern Caribbean people", "response": ["* Ledley King - footballer"]}, {"page": "Robbie Keane", "response": ["The 2005\u201306 season started as the previous one had ended, with Defoe being preferred to partner Mido in Tottenham's strikeforce.
