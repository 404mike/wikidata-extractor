He set nine outdoor and three indoor world records in middle-distance track events \u2013 including, in 1979, setting three world records in the space of 41 days \u2013 and the world record he set in the 800 metres in 1981 remained unbroken until 1997. Coe's rivalries with fellow Britons Steve Ovett and Steve Cram dominated middle-distance racing for much of the 1980s.Following Coe's retirement from athletics, he was a Conservative  member of parliament from 1992 to 1997 for Falmouth in Cornwall, and became a Life Peer on 16 May 2000.\nHe headed the successful London bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and became chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. In 2007, he was elected a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and re-elected for another four-year term in 2011. In August 2015, he was elected president of the IAAF.In 2012, Coe was appointed Pro-Chancellor at Loughborough University where he had been an undergraduate, and is also a member of the University's governing body.

The documentary claimed that it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Games, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb specifically accused the British prime minister Tony Blair and the London bid committee, headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe, of breaking the bid rules. He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews concerning his involvement but the allegation was never fully explored. Turin's 2006 Winter Olympic bid was also clouded by controversy. A prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, closely connected to the rival bid of Sion, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation, and also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid which potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination."]}, {"page": "September 29", "response": ["*1956 \u2013 Sebastian Coe, English sprinter and politician"]}, {"page": "Trinity College, Cambridge", "response": ["It is widely believed that Sebastian Coe successfully completed the run when he beat Steve Cram in a charity race in October 1988.
