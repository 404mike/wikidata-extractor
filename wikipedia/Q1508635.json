His parents were Sir Thomas Fraser and Matilda Wildman.\nAs part of his work for the Egypt Exploration Fund, he worked as a draftsman in the excavations conducted by Sir Flinders Petrie, Percy Edward Newberry and Marcus Worsley Blackden in the Faiyum, in Beni Hasan, in Deir el-Bersha and in the quarries of Hatnub. Less well known is his description of the burial ground dating to the 4th and 5th dynasties, two kilometers south of Tuna el-Gebel, later renamed Fraser Tombs in his honor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Egyptologists", "response": ["*George Willoughby Fraser (British, 1866\u20131923)"]}, {"page": "Akoris, Egypt", "response": ["The so-called Fraser Tombs were firstly discovered by the German Egyptologist Heinrich Brugsch in 1853 and firstly described by the British civil engineer George Willoughby Fraser half a century later."]}, {"page": "Fraser Tombs", "response": ["These tombs were first discovered in the fall of 1853 by the German Egyptologist Heinrich Brugsch and first described by the British civil engineer George Willoughby Fraser, whose name was given to these tombs.Warren R.

More recently, Ryholt obtained a similar result using his own seriation and places Sheshi before Yaqub-Har and the great Hyksos rulers Khyan and Apophis and after Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre. Rolf Krauss independently reached the same conclusion. Given that the earliest 14th Dynasty ruler mentioned on the Turin canon is Nehesy, a king who left several attestations of his reign in the Delta region, and that there is only space for one predecessor for Nehesy on the canon, Ryholt concludes that the earlier document from which the canon was copied had a lacuna preceding Nehesy. Such lacunae are noted as wsf on the canon and could cover any number of kings. Thus, Ryholt sees no obstacle with having Sheshi succeed 'Ammu Ahotepre and immediately precede Nehesy."]}, {"page": "Deir El Bersha", "response": ["In the winter of 1891\u20131892, a survey of tombs at Deir el-Bersha funded by the Egypt Exploration Fund was undertaken by Percy E.

There are many inscriptions on the rocks, and these were first described by George Willoughby Fraser and Marcus Worsley Blackden, members of this same expedition.

Only when Ian Shaw and his team began studying the material remains were the two integrated to give a fuller picture."]}, {"page": "Index of ancient Egypt\u2013related articles", "response": ["* George Willoughby Fraser"]}, {"page": "Khnumhotep II", "response": ["The tomb is fronted by a columned portico and a small courtyard; the courtyard would have been surrounded by mud-brick walls. The small columned portico is on the west side of the courtyard, directly in front of the tomb entrance. The ceiling of the portico is curved similar to the shape of a segmented barrel. The rock around the doorway leading inside the tomb to the chapel was smoothed and flattened, on which a fourteen line inscription is giving the list of the festal days for the services of funeral offerings, called percheru, along with the name and titles of Khnumhotep II. The floor of the main chamber (also referred to as the chapel) is sunk into the ground below the level of the open outer court and is descended into by three steps. The chapel is the main chamber cut straight back into the cliff almost symmetrical with 4 columns and two large shafts (that lead to burial chambers) are cut into the floor. These four main columns support a ceiling that is divided by three segmented barrel shapes.An illustration of this by George Willoughby Fraser is available in Newberry\u2019s book. These vaults are painted in a pattern that may be referencing a tent. The only light for this chamber would have come from the doorway to the portico and originally a door, between the portico and the chamber, could have been used to close the tomb to the outdoor elements. Percy Newberry notes that the only remain from the inward swinging door is the pivot-hole. On the doorjambs are prayers to Osiris and Anubis above a seated Khnumhotep II who is facing inward. At the back of this main room (east wall) is a small rectangular shine approached by a step about  high. Newberry mentions that from his survey of the tomb there was a statue here of a seated Khnumhotep II, but the entire statue had been cut away and only a portion of the seat remains."]}]}}
