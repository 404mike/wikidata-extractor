Many modern writers have seen this sentence as Darwin\u2019s only reference to humans in the book; Janet Browne describes it as his only discussion there of human origins, while noting that the book makes other references to humanity.For example, , \"In this book, he was completely silent on the subject of human origins, although he did refer in several places to mankind as an example of biological details. The only words he allowed himself\u2014and these out of a sense of duty that he must somewhere refer to human beings\u2013were gnomic in their brevity.

The letters, over 15,000 in all,  provide many insights on issues ranging from the origins of key scientific concepts, to religious and philosophical discussions which have continued to the present day. The letters also illuminate many aspects of Darwin and his biography: the development of his ideas; insights into character and health; and private opinions on controversial issues. His letters to the Harvard botanist Asa Gray, for example, show his opinions on slavery and the American Civil War. Darwin relied upon correspondence for much of his scientific work, and also used letters to marshal support for his ideas amongst friends and colleagues. The historian of science Janet Browne has argued that Darwin's ability to correspond daily played a crucial role in the development of his theory and his ability to garner support for it from colleagues."]}, {"page": "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation", "response": ["Among the early readers of Vestiges, Charles Darwin had conceived his own theory of natural selection to explain evolution six years earlier, and in July 1844 had written down his ideas in an '\"Essay\". For a year he had been tentatively discussing his evolutionary ideas in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker, who wrote to Darwin on 30 December 1844 that he had \"been delighted with Vestiges, from the multiplicity of facts he brings together, though I do [not] agree with his conclusions at all, he must be a funny fellow: somehow the books looks more like a 9 days wonder than a lasting work: it certainly is \"filling at the price\".\u2014 I mean the price its reading costs, for it is dear enough otherwise; he has lots of errors.\" Darwin had read the book in November, finding that it drew on some of the lines of evidence he had been putting together, and introduced questions that had to be dealt with. He responded that he had been \"somewhat less amused at it\u00a0.... the writing & arrangement are certainly admirable, but his geology strikes me as bad, & his zoology far worse. Darwin had learnt geology from Adam Sedgwick, and was particularly interested in what his former mentor had to say about evolution. In October 1845 he wrote to his friend Charles Lyell that Sedgwick's review was a \"grand piece of argument against mutability of species\" which he had read with \"fear & trembling,\" but had been \"well pleased to find\" that he had anticipated Sedgwick's objections and \"had not overlooked any of the arguments\"..
