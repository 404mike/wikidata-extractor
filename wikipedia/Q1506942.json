He was also a street commissioner there, and a governor of King Edward's School.As a conservative, he campaigned unsuccessfully against the incorporation of Birmingham, which was nonetheless enacted in October 1838.He devoted a large portion of his time both to scientific pursuits and to benevolent and social enterprises. He exerted himself with great energy to extend the advantages of the General Hospital, on behalf of which he was one of the chief promoters of, and a long-standing chairman of the committee of, the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival, until ill health forced his retirement in 1843. He was the founder of the now defunct Birmingham Philosophical Institution, and by his lectures on chemistry gave a considerable impetus to certain special manufactures. From the first he took a special interest in the inventions of James Watt and Matthew Boulton, becoming friends with both men. It was chiefly owing to his exertions that an Act of Parliament was obtained for the London and Birmingham Railway. In recognition of his scientific achievements he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1839. He died on 6 December 1845 at his home in the city's Springfield district.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Barker", "response": ["George Barker may refer to:", "*George Barker (British politician) (1858\u20131936), Member of Parliament for Abertillery, Wales", "*George Barker (Virginia politician) (born 1951), Member of the Virginia State Senate", "*George Barker (painter) (1882\u20131965), American portrait and landscape painter", "*George Barker (photographer) (1844\u20131894), Canadian-American photographer known for his pictures of Niagara Falls", "*George Barker (poet) (1913\u20131991), English poet and author", "*George Barker (footballer, born 1875), English footballer", "*George Barker (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u20131947), Australian rules footballer", "*George Barker (footballer, born 1991), English footballer", "*George Barker (footballer, born 1916) (1916\u20131993), Australian rules footballer", "*George Barker (cricketer) (1819\u20131893), English cricketer", "*George Barker (benefactor) (1776\u20131845), British scientist and philanthropist", "*George Barker Jeffery (1891\u20131957), English mathematician"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Triennial Music Festival", "response": ["* George Barker (benefactor) - long-standing chairman of the festival committee, until 1843"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Street Commissioners", "response": ["The Board of Street Commissioners consisted of fifty residents, unpaid, each of whom owned property with a rateable value of over fifteen pounds.
