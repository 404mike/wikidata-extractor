He played amateur football while working as a collier and a steel worker prior to entering professional football with Bolton Wanderers in 1922. He went on to play almost 150 matches in the Football League for Bolton, Nelson and Southport, before moving into non-league football in 1928.

Arriving alongside fellow Welsh international Jack Newnes, Beadles scored 20 league goals during his first season at the club, including hat-tricks during victories over New Brighton and Walsall. He also scored in the side's third round FA Cup victory over First Division side Blackburn Rovers. However, he was forced to miss their fourth round tie against Beadles' former club Liverpool due to injury. He spent three seasons at Southport, finishing as the club's top scorer in all three seasons and setting a new club record by scoring in six consecutive matches, between 21 April 1928 and 15 September 1928."]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["Nelson entered the FA Cup in the Fifth Qualifying Round, and were knocked out in a replay at that stage by Wigan Borough, having drawn the original tie.

New signings included defender Jack Newnes, who went on to become a Wales international, Billy Caulfield and Eddie Cameron. With 14 goals in 42 appearances, Joe Eddleston was the team's top goalscorer for the third season in succession, and also played the highest number of matches of all the first-team squad.

Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top goalscorer in each of the previous three seasons, was retained along with captain Clem Rigg, Welsh half-back Jack Newnes and goalkeeper Harry Abbott. The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively. Inside forward Dick Crawshaw, who had been the team's second-highest scorer in 1923\u201324 with five goals, moved to Stalybridge Celtic.Dykes (2009), p. 30 Scottish forward Mike McCulloch ended his two-year association with the club by joining Chesterfield on a free transfer, while half-back Leigh Collins signed for New Brighton.

The Nelson squad was considered by the local newspaper to be stronger than the one which had won the Third Division North two seasons earlier.", "Nelson began their league campaign on 30 August 1924 with an away match at Southport, who had ended the previous season in seventh position. New signings Billy Bottrill, Bill Ellerington and Joseph O'Beirne went straight into the starting line-up but they could not prevent Southport winning by a single goal from Jack Barber,  giving them their first ever League win against Nelson. A week later, Nelson played their first home game of the season, in which James Phizacklea made his debut for the club. A crowd of around 6,000 saw Ashington beaten 4\u20130 thanks to goals from Bottrill, Joe Eddleston, Jack Newnes and Sid Hoad. Three days later, Eddleston scored twice as Doncaster Rovers were defeated by three goals to nil in the first midweek match of the campaign. However, Nelson could not continue their winning streak as they lost 0\u20132 against Accrington Stanley at Peel Park in the following fixture. On 16 September, Nelson achieved their biggest victory in the Football League at that time with a 7\u20131 win over Durham City at Seedhill. The game saw Eddleston score his first hat-trick since the 3\u20130 victory away at Rochdale in January 1923, and O'Beirne and Eddie Cameron score their first goals of the season. Four days later, Nelson suffered their third consecutive defeat away from home, losing 0\u20133 to Barrow at Holker Street. The team continued their good home form the following week with a narrow win against Lincoln City. Nelson named the same team for the seventh game in succession for the trip to Tranmere Rovers on 4 October, but the side were beaten for the fourth straight away match thanks to goals from Dixie Dean and Jimmy Moreton.", "Nelson used a total of 23 players during the 1924\u201325 season and there were 13 different goalscorers. There were also four squad members who did not make a first-team appearance in the campaign. The team played in a 2\u20133\u20135 formation (the standard formation at the time) throughout the campaign, with two full-backs, three half-backs, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre forward. Two players, goalkeeper Harry Abbott and half-back Ernie Braidwood, appeared in all 44 Third Division and FA Cup matches. Joe Eddleston missed just one game, the defeat against Durham City on 29 April, while Welsh international Jack Newnes made 42 appearances in the season. Two players played only once during the season; Fred Smith deputised for Edgar Chadwick at inside-left in the win against Southport on 21 April, and Allan Bottrill appeared in the final match of the season in place of Eddleston.
