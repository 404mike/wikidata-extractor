He went to Rugby School, being made captain of the cricket team in 1944.In 1949 he made his first-class debut with Cambridge, scoring 45 against Sussex, and he played nine times for them that season, although he did not gain his Blue. He also appeared for the University team on one further occasion, in 1950, but his subsequent four first-class matches were with Worcestershire late in that same season. Although his fielding was excellent, he was unable to make enough runs \u2014 his best score for the county was only 26 \u2014 and it was not altogether a surprise when he failed to reappear in 1951.\nAnton died in Brisbane, Australia on 28 August 2021, at the age of 94.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Rugbeians", "response": ["* John Anton, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "John Anton", "response": ["John Anton is the name of:", "* John Anton (cricketer) (1926\u20132021), English cricketer", "* John Anton (soccer) (born 1955), American retired soccer forward "]}, {"page": "Hamish Anton", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Anton (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2021", "response": ["*John Anton, 94, English cricketer (Cambridge University, Worcestershire).John Hamish Hugh Anton"]}]}}
