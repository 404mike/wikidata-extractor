It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal \u2013 which gave Wales a win over Ireland and made up for him missing a dropped goal by just a yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played one of the two Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, in the country's first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen's in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home \u2013 this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country."]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*6 August \u2013 Thomas Pryce-Jenkins, Wales international rugby player, 60"]}, {"page": "1862 in Wales", "response": ["*1 February \u2013 Thomas Pryce-Jenkins, Wales international rugby player (d. 1922)"]}, {"page": "Frank Hill (rugby union)", "response": ["Hill was first selected for Wales in a match against Scotland as part of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Newport's Charlie Newman, the game was a dull scoreless draw caused by Welsh attempts to kill the game at any opportunity. Hill played in both Welsh matches of the 1886 Championship, but was not chosen during the next year's tournament. In 1888 Hill experienced his first international win, when he was part of the Wales team that beat Scotland at Rodney Parade.

Thomas was back for both games of the 1888 Championship, but by now was representing London based exiles, London Welsh. The opening game saw the first Welsh win over Scotland, thanks to a debut try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins.

Bland played in both games, which saw Wales win their first match over Scotland thanks to a Thomas Pryce-Jenkins try, but in a reversal of fortunes the very next match saw the Welsh lose to Ireland; the first victory for the Irish over Wales. Towards the end of 1888, Bland was selected for the Welsh game to face the touring New Zealand Natives played at St. Helen's Ground, Swansea. The Welsh players experienced a hostile home crowd during the match due to the lack of Swansea players in the squad;Smith (1972), pg 17. but after trialing the four three-quarter system again, were able to beat the M\u0101ori opposition by a goal and two tries to nil. Bland played against the same touring M\u0101ori team, just seven days later, when his club team, Cardiff, hosted the New Zealanders at the Cardiff Arms Park. A goal from Norman Biggs and a rare joint try from Sydney Nicholls and W.T.

Wales won the game thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins and Meredith was reselected for the next game of the tournament, played away to Ireland at Lansdowne Road.
