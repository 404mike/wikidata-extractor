Since Hyman reserved only one hour in his day for training (except for Sundays when he often ran for 2 hours or more), he devised sessions that used the sixty minutes effectively. He regularly ran around 50 miles a week and never went over 70. More than most successful running careers, Hyman\u2019s was based on intelligence and determination. Running became an outlet for his driven personality, and he had the self-discipline to get the most out of himself while at the same time living a full life as a teacher and family man.Hyman competed in the men's 10,000 metres at the 1960 Summer Olympics. He also represented England in the 6 miles race at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales. Four years later, he competed in both the 6 miles race and the marathon at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia.In addition to athletics, Hyman also played a key role in the development of elite orienteering in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s as founder and running coach of the British Orienteering Squad. He was part of the team during that period that progressed the Squad from a very low level to world class.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*Martin Hyman"]}, {"page": "Hyman", "response": ["* Martin Hyman (1933\u20132021), British long-distance runner"]}, {"page": "Nos Galan road race", "response": ["*1962 \u2013 Martin Hyman"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 10,000 metres", "response": ["| 9 ||align=left| Martin Hyman ||align=left|  || 29:05.11 ||"]}, {"page": "International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|19618.9\u00a0mi (14.3\u00a0km)||Basil Heatley || 45:22.2||Antonio Amoros || 45:46||Martin Hyman || 45:56.4"]}, {"page": "1961 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|Martin Hyman || 45:56.4", "|align=center|  || Martin Hyman ||  || 45:56.4", "|align=center|  2 || align=left |  || align=left | Basil HeatleyMartin HymanRoy FowlerTed MatleyPeter WilkinsonMike Turner || 71"]}, {"page": "1962 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 10,000 metres", "response": ["| 4 || align=left | Martin Hyman || align=left |  || 29:02.0 || "]}, {"page": "England at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=left|Martin Hyman", "|align=left|Martin Hyman"]}, {"page": "England at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Martin Hyman                      ||6 miles||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 6 miles", "response": ["|  ||align=left| Martin Hyman ||align=left|  || 28:58.6 ||"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2021", "response": ["*Martin Hyman, 87, British Olympic long-distance runner (1960).\u2018Martin Hyman didn\u2019t care what level you were at \u2013 he just wanted to help\u2019"]}, {"page": "Hyman, Martin", "response": ["#redirectMartin Hyman"]}]}}
