In 1963 Roger Hollis, the MI5 director general, authorised the secret investigation of Mitchell following suspicions within the Secret Intelligence Service MI6 that he was a Soviet agent. It is now thought unlikely that Mitchell ever was a \"mole\". Mitchell was an International Master of correspondence chess who represented Great Britain.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford University Chess Club", "response": ["* Graham Russell Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Graham Mitchell", "response": ["*Graham Russell Mitchell (1905\u20131984), Deputy Director General of the Security Service MI5 1956\u20131963"]}, {"page": "1957 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Graham Russell Mitchell, , Attached War Office."]}, {"page": "1951 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Graham Russell Mitchell, Civil Assistant, War Office (later deputy director general MI5."]}, {"page": "Graham Mitchell (MI5 officer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graham Russell Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Joseph Ball (British public servant)", "response": ["Ball was a 'fervent political supporter' of the Conservative Party.
