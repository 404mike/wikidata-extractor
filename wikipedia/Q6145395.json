His domestic cricket added another three wickets to give him an overall average of 56.75, however Martin Williamson, the managing editor of ESPNcricinfo, records Gower, along with James Whitaker, as \"probably two of the worst bowlers in the country\" in 1983. On one occasion, during Steve O'Shaughnessy's 35-minute century for Lancashire, Gower conceded 102 for 0 from nine overs. In the 1986 Test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge, Gower became the only England bowler to be called for throwing in a Test in England. Handed the ball by captain Mike Gatting with New Zealand requiring only one run to win, Gower deliberately threw his first ball to Martin Crowe. Technically the game ended with the no-ball call, but Crowe hit a four off the ball which was permitted to stand, leaving Gower with the unusual match bowling figures of 0-0-4-0 (1nb)."]}, {"page": "Skipton", "response": ["Former Lancashire and England cricketer and current head coach of Lancashire County Cricket Club, Glen Chapple was born in Skipton in 1974.
