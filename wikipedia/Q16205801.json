His case was a Canadian precedent, and created significant controversy after the Supreme Court of Canada upheld his acquittal.  He was found to have been denied access to an attorney because he was not informed of legal services available to him when he told police he could not afford a lawyer. This case had nationwide ramifications, requiring all police officers to advise a person under arrest of the availability of legal services even if they couldn't afford them.", "William Brydges was arrested on December 16, 1985 in connection with the murder of Mrs. MacLeod, which took place on March 29, 1979.  Brydges was 16 at the time of the murder and 22 when he was arrested.  Although he was a resident of Alberta, he was arrested in Strathclair, Manitoba while visiting his stepfather.", "On December 16, 1985, Detective Harris of the Edmonton City Police and Corporal Munro, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer arrested William Brydges.  Brydges was brought to the nearest police station (in Manitoba) for questioning.", "William Brydges' original acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada as they agreed with the original trial judge's ruling of throwing out the interrogation evidence under Section 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The judge ruled that he was not given his right to a lawyer; instead, he was in essence told that he would only be granted this right if he knew one or could afford one. Due to this violation of the charter, the judge ruled that the admission of the evidence would put the justice system in disrepute."]}, {"page": "Church of St Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent", "response": ["* William Brydges 1802\u20131835"]}, {"page": "William Brydges (disambiguation)", "response": ["William Brydges may refer to:", "*William Brydges, 20th-century Canadian murder suspect", "*William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos (1552\u20131602), English peer and politician", "*William Brydges (organist) (1775\u20131835), English organist and composer"]}]}}
