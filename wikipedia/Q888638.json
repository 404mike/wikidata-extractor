Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a championship winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton had to work with some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Rutherglen", "response": ["* Bobby Murdoch, Celtic midfielder (one of the Lisbon Lions); in 2016 a plaque and display was unveiled at the Town Hall honouring his achievements"]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["* Bobby Murdoch (2004 inductee)", "| 1981\u20131982 || Bobby Murdoch"]}, {"page": "Troon F.C.", "response": ["European Cup winners John Clark, Bobby Murdoch, Stevie Chalmers and Lou Macari were in the Celtic ranks that day, which the Hoops triumphed in 7-2."]}, {"page": "Tommy McAvoy", "response": ["McAvoy and his wife Eleanor were married in 1968 in , Rutherglen, and had four sons.

Ahead of the first leg of a European tie against Red Star Belgrade at Parkhead in November 1968, Stein told Johnstone that, if Celtic won by four goals, he wouldn't have to travel to Yugoslavia for the second leg. Johnstone went on to produce an outstanding performance, scoring twice and providing assists for the other three goals in a 5\u20131 win. He helped Celtic reach a further European Cup Final in season 1969\u201370. His performance in the second leg of the semi-final against Leeds United at Hampden Park was particularly outstanding, and his mazy run in the second half set up Bobby Murdoch to score with a powerful shot for Celtic's winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory on the night. Leeds' defender Terry Cooper later quipped \"I would love to have kicked Jinky, but I couldn't get near him!\" Billy Bremner described Johnstone's performance as \"one of the greatest exhibitions I have ever seen\", adding that \"Jimmy had one of these games where he was unstoppable.\" Celtic played Feyenoord in the final but, with Johnstone double-marked at all times, Celtic were unable to perform as they had in the 1967 final.

The Italians then retreated into their famous 11-man defence. Inter did not win a single corner and forced Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson to make only two saves. Celtic had two shots off the crossbar, and 39 other attempts on goal, 13 of which were saved by Italian goalkeeper Giuliano Sarti, seven were blocked or deflected, and 19 were off-target. Craig made amends for his penalty mistake on 63 minutes, when he laid off the ball for Tommy Gemmell to fire home for the Celtic equaliser. With 83 minutes on the clock, Gemmell was allowed space, and he played the ball to Bobby Murdoch, whose long-range shot was deflected by Stevie Chalmers past Sarti into the net.", "#Bobby Murdoch "]}, {"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["In July 1957, Stein was given the job of coaching the Celtic reserve team. His squad included a number of young players who would later play under him in the first team, including Billy McNeill, Bobby Murdoch and John Clark. In his first season as a coach, Stein won the Reserve Cup with an 8\u20132 aggregate triumph over Rangers. Despite this success, according to football journalist Archie MacPherson, Stein was told by club chairman Robert Kelly he would not progress further at Celtic due to his Protestant faith; Celtic had only previously appointed Catholics as manager, though one of these, Willie Maley had spent 50 years at the club and Stein was only the fourth person to be appointed Celtic manager, after Maley, Jimmy McStay and Jimmy McGrory, who was manager for 20 years. It was later suggested that Stein was allowed to leave Celtic temporarily with the intention of later appointing him manager, but MacPherson found no evidence for this."]}, {"page": "Murdoch", "response": ["* Bobby Murdoch, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Graeme Souness", "response": ["Souness' tenacious style began to garner acclaim during his time at Middlesbrough. His first season saw Middlesbrough finish fourth, two places and 14 points short of promotion. Jack Charlton was appointed Middlesbrough manager, his first managerial post, in May 1973. One of Charlton's first signings was experienced former Celtic midfielder Bobby Murdoch, a fellow Scot whom Souness later cited as an important influence in the development of his playing style. Promotion as champions of the Second Division followed in 1973\u201374. Souness' influence was demonstrated when he scored a hat-trick in the season's final fixture, an 8\u20130 victory over Sheffield Wednesday."]}]}}
