He edited Resistance, a poetry magazine of just one issue, with David West in 1946.\nFor a period in the early 1950s he worked with Muriel Spark on several books, and was a supporter of hers (together with the poetic eccentric Hugo Manning, a long-term friend), in the Poetry Society. Stanford described Spark's ousting in Inside the Forties. \nSpark convinced him of the talent of Dylan Thomas, and Stanford wrote an early book on Thomas shortly after his death. He is associated with the character Hector Bartlett in Muriel Spark's A Far Cry from Kensington (1988).Stanford died in 2008, aged 90, in Brighton. His widow is the poet Julie Whitby.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", "response": ["In 1959, two biographies were published: Anne Bront\u00eb, her life and work by Ada Harrison and Derek Stanford and Anne Bront\u00eb by Winifred G\u00e9rin. Noting that The Tenant was published some ten years before George Eliot's novels, Harrison and Stanford named Anne the \"first realist woman writer\" in Great Britain. Unlike some early critics, who considered the scenes of debauchery improbable,Allott, The Brontes: The Critical Heritage, pp. 258\u2013259 Harrison and Stanford believed them to be \"described in a fashion which Zola might have admired.\" Winifred G\u00e9rin believed Helen Graham to be \"one of the first married women in fiction who is both competent and resolved to keep herself not by any of the accepted means as housekeeper, companion or governess, but as a painter, selling her canvasses to dealers.\" Despite this, in her later work on the Bront\u00ebs, G\u00e9rin dismissed The Tenant as being \"written too obviously as a work of propaganda, a treatise against drunkenness, to be considered a work of art.\" Several years later, however, G\u00e9rin wrote an introduction to The Tenant, where, while considering the framed structure in both The Tenant and Wuthering Heights a \"clumsy devise,\" acknowledged Anne's \"pre-eminent gift of story-teller\" and \"eloquence in proclaiming the equality of men and women.\" She believed that The Tenant \"might be said to be the first manifesto for 'Women's Lib'\". Inga-Stina Ewbank considered Anne the least talented of the sisters and claimed that the framing structure \u2013 where \"Helen can reveal her innermost being to the diary\" while Gilbert is \"bound to be as objective as possible\" \u2013 \"throws the novel out of balance.\" However, she believed that \"through the very nature of its central concern, The Tenant is feminist in the deepest sense of the word.\""]}, {"page": "Muriel Spark", "response": ["*Tribute to Wordsworth (edited with Derek Stanford, 1950)", "*Emily Bront\u00eb: Her Life and Work (with Derek Stanford; 1953)", "*My Best Mary (a selection of letters of Mary Shelley, edited with Derek Stanford, 1953)", "*Letters of John Henry Newman (edited with Derek Stanford, 1957)"]}, {"page": "Christopher Fry", "response": ["* Christopher Fry: An Appreciation (1951) by Derek Stanford"]}, {"page": "John Bayliss", "response": ["He edited: The Fortune Anthology (1942) with Nicholas Moore, and Douglas Newton; New Road (1943 and 1944) with Alex Comfort; A Romantic Miscellany (1946) with Derek Stanford.
