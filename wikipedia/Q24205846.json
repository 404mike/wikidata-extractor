Many of his organs were erected in Australia and South Africa.(van der Linde 1993)\nBevington was born in London to Samuel and Elizabeth (Portsmouth) Bevington, who were Quakers. He was an apprentice of Ohrmann & Nutt, and also of John Snetzler. He began his trade as journeyman with Robert Gray.(Thistlethwaite 1999, p. 58) He set up his own workshop in Greek Street, Soho, London in 1794,(Boeringer & Freeman 1989, p. 89)  his earliest recorded organ is dated 1820.\nBevington was also an accomplished organist and was the organist at King's College, London.(Boeringer & Freeman 1989, p. 89)\nHe died in 1850, aged 73, and was buried at St Peter's Church, Walworth.Bevington's organ building business was continued by his sons; Henry and Martin, in Rose Street, Soho, in the same premises as were occupied by Ohrmann. The organ of St. Martin's in the Fields and of the Foundling Hospital in London, and that of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, were built by the Bevington firm.(de Pontigny 1900)(Thistlethwaite 2000)\nOn 21 May 1854, a fire damaged his works on Rose Street, including the original carved case being constructed for St. Martin's in the Fields, and valuable tools. Fortunately, the majority of their inventory was at the Greek Street location.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney", "response": ["* The first pipe organ installed in the original cathedral was built by Henry Bevington of London and installed in June 1841.

Between 1845 and 1849 a new church was built with a nave, chancel and both north and south aisles in a Decorated Gothic style, and a Norman Revival style bell-chamber was added to the top of the tower.

A new organ was purchased in 1855 from Henry Bevington of London. This was kept until the end of the 20th century. The current organ was acquired from St Catharine's Church, Nottingham in 2003.

He was apprenticed in 1842\u201349 to the London organ builder Henry Bevington, and then worked as a foreman for James Bishop & Son. Fincham emigrated to Australia in 1852 and started working as an organ tuner and repairer 113 Queen Street in Melbourne. In 1853 he went to the diggings at Ballarat. He returned to Melbourne in 1854 and worked as a builder on the Spencer Street railway station. Within ten years of his arrival in Australia he had raised sufficient funds to equip a workshop and buy stock to begin organ building as George Fincham & Sons. Also by this time churches had funds for pipe organs and interest in organ music was growing, helped by the arrival of organists such as Charles Horsley, David Lee and the Revd George Torrance in Australia. The organ building business grew and by 1904 he had a branches in Adelaide and Sydney, and agents in Perth and Brisbane."]}, {"page": "Nottingham Mechanics' Institution", "response": ["A specification of the pipe organ, built by Henry Bevington, can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register."]}, {"page": "Church of St Michael and All Angels, Christchurch", "response": ["The present fine Henry Bevington and Sons pipe organ was installed in 1873.

He made sure that all around were safely away, before making his way from the burning remains of the church by rowing-boat to Stepney, bombs falling around him as he went. After the bombing, Thrift advertised in the Church Times: \"Holy Trinity, Rotherhithe. Church bombed and everything destroyed. Can you supply one of our immediate needs?\" The adjacent school buildings (already condemned in 1939) survived the War, were used for services until the completion of the present church in 1959, and remain in use as the Church Hall.

The stop-list of the Bevington organ was for a 3-manual and pedal organ and was quite ambitious for an English local parish church in the mid-19th century. In the early 20th century, it was replaced by the present organ, also a 3-manual and pedal organ, built by the Leeds firm of Abbott and Smith, which had its factory on Blackman Lane and a good reputation for the sound and construction of its organs. The stop-list of the present organ is very similar, although not identical, to that of the Bevington organ, so much of the present pipework may be from the earlier instrument, although this has never been confirmed."]}, {"page": "Christ Church, East Stour", "response": ["The church underwent renovation in 1866, which included staining and varnishing its woodwork and improving the interior.

The churchyard was extended in 1908 after an adjoining plot of land was gifted by Lord Stalbridge. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev.
