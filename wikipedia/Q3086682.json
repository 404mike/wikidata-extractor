Two minutes later, Fraser Waters blocked Moody as the former tried to protect Joe Worsley at the kick-off in front of the referee and the goal posts. The result earned Tigers a penalty kick, which was scored by Goode for his second of the match to make it 8\u20136. Wasps received another penalty after 18 minutes when Corry was reprimanded by Lewis for not moving away from the ball. King's penalty kick was a weak effort from , giving him his third miss of the day. Play was stopped on 27 minutes due to a dispute between Vickery and Corry which was found to have been started by the former. Tigers earned a penalty in a five-metre scrum but Goode's kick went straight down the field. Iba\u00f1ez passed low to Simon Shaw, who was near the five-metre line. Shaw returned the ball to Iba\u00f1ez, who ran to the corner unchallenged and scored Wasps' second try to double their lead to 13\u20136 on 34 minutes. King was again unable to convert the try when the ball hit the goalposts at his fourth shot at goal. Four minutes later, Tigers earned a penalty kick when Tom Palmer committed an infraction at a ruck. Goode scored to complete a penalty hat-trick.
