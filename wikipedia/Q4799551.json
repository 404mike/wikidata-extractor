He changed his surname from Longbottom to Langley after his retirement from football.\nHe spent 1954 to 1961 at Queens Park Rangers, before he was sold on to Port Vale in May 1961 for a \u00a32,000 fee. He was sold on to Millwall for another \u00a32,000 in January 1963, before joining Oxford United in the summer. He transferred to Colchester United in October 1964, and then moved into non-league football with Scarborough in May 1965.
