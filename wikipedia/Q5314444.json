He is known for his science writings as well as for his work on the Sighthill stone circle.His 1970s report of a possible space probe orbiting around the Moon sent by the inhabitants of a planet orbiting Epsilon Bo\u00f6tis brought him to international notice.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Duncan Lunan (born 1945)"]}, {"page": "Troon", "response": ["*Duncan Lunan, writer"]}, {"page": "Epsilon Bo\u00f6tis", "response": ["In 1973, the Scottish astronomer and science fiction writer Duncan Lunan claimed to have managed to interpret a message caught in the 1920s by two Norwegian physicists that, according to his theory, came from a 10,000 year old satellite polar orbiting the Earth known as the Black Knight and sent there by the inhabitants of a planet orbiting Epsilon Bo\u00f6tis. The story was even reported in Time magazine. Lunan later withdrew his Epsilon Bo\u00f6tis theory, presenting proofs against it and clarifying why he was brought to formulate it in the first place, but later revoked his withdrawal."]}, {"page": "Bantam Books", "response": ["* Duncan Lunan"]}, {"page": "Sighthill, Glasgow", "response": ["Sighthill hosts the first astronomically aligned stone circle built in Great Britain for 3,000\u00a0years, guided by Duncan Lunan. Built at the highest point of Sighthill Park, the stone circle has a vantage point over the surrounding areas. There are 17 stones in the circle \u2013 with 16 forming a circle  across, and the largest four-tonne stone in the centre. The Sighthill megalith was intended as a tribute to both the ancient megalith builders and the scientists who discovered their significance.

William says that she eventually married a man from King's Lynn, about  from Woolpit, where she was still living shortly before he wrote. Based on his research into Richard de Calne's family history, the astronomer and writer Duncan Lunan has concluded that the girl was given the name 'Agnes' and that she married a royal official named Richard Barre.", "Other commentators have suggested that the children may have been aliens, or inhabitants of a world beneath the Earth. In a 1996 article published in the magazine Analog, astronomer Duncan Lunan hypothesised that the children were accidentally transported to Woolpit from their home planet as the result of a \"matter transmitter\" malfunction.  Lunan suggests that the planet from which the children were expelled may be trapped in synchronous orbit around its sun, presenting the conditions for life only in a narrow twilight zone between a fiercely hot surface and a frozen dark side. He explains the children's green colouration as a side effect of consuming the genetically modified alien plants eaten by the planet's inhabitants."]}, {"page": "Stars and planetary systems in fiction", "response": ["* Space Probe Epsilon (1974), German language novel (Raumsonde Epsilon) by Mark Brandis.
