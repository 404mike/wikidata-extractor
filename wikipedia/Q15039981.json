Dunlop wrote that it was not mentioned by Ware in his Writers of Ireland. He mentions a copy (perhaps unique) in the Haliday collection in the Royal Irish Academy. John Patrick Prendergast, who first called attention to it, gave a fairly complete abstract of it in his Cromwellian Settlement. Though exceedingly temperate in its tone, it immediately elicited a sharp rejoinder from Colonel Richard Lawrence, a prominent member of the committee of transplantation. Gookin replied in The Author and Case of Transplanting the Irish into Connaught vindicated from the unjust aspersions of Col. R. Lawrence, London, 1655. He had been charged with being a degenerate Englishman, and with having been corrupted by the Irish. He denied the charge, saying that he was elected by the English of Kinsale and Bandon to the Barebones Parliament, and his constituents had shown their regard for him by offering to pay his expenses to England."]}, {"page": "John Prendergast", "response": ["* John Patrick Prendergast (1808\u20131893), Irish historian"]}, {"page": "John P.
