In the case of the Raja Pratap Singh, Raja of Satara, there was controversy both in the Court of the East India CompanyDebates at India House on the Case Deposed Raja of Satara and Impeachment of Col C Ovans 1845  and in Parliament.Hansard 11 July 1848 As Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet commented in the House of Commons in July, 1848: \"Major Oliphant had given an opinion in favour of the Raja's innocence. The fact was, however, that Major Oliphant was the only one out of thirty directors who ever wrote or spoke one word, not merely against the honour, but against the propriety of the conduct of Colonel Ovans.\" As John Elliot said in the same debate in the House of Commons, the issue brought into question the very integrity of the East India Company's government in Bombay. That the Raja of Satara was badly treated is not a matter of dispute today. In September, 1839 the Raja of Satara was dethroned, banished and stripped of his private property by the H.E.I.C.'s government in Bombay. The Raja had been presented with two choices, either admit to a host of charges, in which case he could retain his position or plead his innocence and be stripped of almost everything that he owned or stood for. Since the charges were concocted by his enemies (whom the British administration chose to stand with and would not give the Raja adequate opportunity to refute) the Raja rightly felt wronged. The Raja's one main ally was the Governor, Sir Robert Grant until the latter's death in July, 1838 - the same year that Oliphant, a fellow Scot retired from active service in India (and whose brother had been a Member of Parliament during the last two years of Grant's time in the House of Commons - 1832 to 1834). Whether there was any direct link between Oliphant and Grant is unknown.The Satara raj, 1818-1848: a study in history, administration, and culture. By Sumitra Kulkarni (1995) (pages 21, 22, 23, 24) That Oliphant's stance in the Satara affair in the 1840s brought controversy to the East India Company and questioned their integrity and that of Col C Ovans, does not seem to have affected Oliphant's career, as five years later he was elected Deputy Chairman and then the following year Chairman of that organisation."]}, {"page": "Francis Bevan", "response": ["On 22 July 1862, he married Elizabeth Marianne Russell, the daughter of the politician Lord Charles Russell and Isabella Clarisa Davies.
