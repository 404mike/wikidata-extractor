On the death of his kinsman Charles Sackville-Germain, 5th Duke of Dorset, in 1843, the dukedom and its subsidiary titles became extinct. Large parts of the Sackville estates passed to the West family through Elizabeth. The Sackville-Wests inherited parts of the estates by arrangement, notably the estate of Knole Park in Kent.\nDuring his career Sackville-West held several high appointments within the Royal household. In 1876 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Sackville, of Knole in the County of Kent. The peerage was created with special remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to his younger brothers Lionel and William Edward. He died in 1888, aged 68, and was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his younger brother Lionel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Knole", "response": ["John Frederick's only son, George, the fourth duke, died in 1815 aged 21, and Knole was then left by the 3rd Duke's widow in 1825 to their daughter Mary, Countess of Plymouth.
