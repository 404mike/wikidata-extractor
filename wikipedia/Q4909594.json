Late that year Peter McWilliam was appointed manager. He became a significant and popular figure at the club, managing the team in two separate periods, both interrupted by world wars. The first significant signing by McWilliam was winger Fanny Walden, who was signed for a record \u00a31,700 in April 1913, later signings included goalkeeper Bill Jaques and right-back Tommy Clay.  McWilliam's record in the early years was poor, and Tottenham were bottom of the league at the end of the 1914\u201315 season when league football was suspended owing to the First World War that had started a year earlier.  During the war years, White Hart Lane was taken over by the government and turned into a factory for making gas masks, gunnery and protection equipment. The London clubs organised their own matches, and Tottenham played their home games at Arsenal's Highbury and Clapton Orient's Homerton grounds."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Bexley", "response": ["*Bill Jaques (1888\u20131925), footballer, born in Erith."]}]}}
