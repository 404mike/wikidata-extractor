He became the Bishop of St David's in 1897.Born at Ysgubor Wen, Caernarfonshire (Gwynedd), his father Griffith Owen was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist. Though he never deviated from his own loyalties, he watched his son's career as an Anglican with great pride. Owen's mother, Ann Jones from Aberdaron, could not easily reconcile herself to her son becoming an Anglican, however, nor could she wholly accept the fact that he married an English wife.\nIn 1872, Owen was awarded a mathematical scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford, where he read classics and mathematics. As a graduate, he began a teaching career at Botwnnog grammar school. Whilst at Botwnnog, Owen discovered an interest in the Anglicanism and was gradually drawn towards ordination, though he decided to teach for a few years until he was sure of his vocation.\nAs a respected educator, Owen was appointed Professor of Welsh at St David's College, Lampeter (now the University of Wales Trinity Saint David), in 1879 and committed himself in two respects: he would advance the study of the Welsh language at the college and would aim to be ordained before, or soon after, joining the college. In both respects he was successful and was ordained deacon in 1879 and priest in 1880.\nIn 1889, A. G. Edwards, newly appointed Bishop of St Asaph, invited Owen to join him as dean. At St Asaph, Owen maintained an interest in education and his colleagues nominated him to serve on the charter committee of the nascent University of Wales, established in 1891, which gave him a new emphasis to his existing interest in higher education.\nIn 1892, Owen returned to Lampeter as principal, an office he was to hold until he became Bishop of Saint David's in 1897. His time as principal was not an easy one: he fought a sustained battle for Lampeter to be included in the newly formed federal University of Wales, which had already embraced the colleges at Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff universities. Lampeter already conferred its own degrees under Royal Charter and, for Owen, it was unthinkable that it should be excluded from this new university. Those against Lampeter's admission, however, argued that the original plan for Lampeter had been to found a theological college and, as such, it should be excluded like any other denominational college in the nation. Owen was furious, regarding Lampeter as a university institution and theological college. He petitioned the privy council, sparking a debate in the House of Lords. Lampeter's case was upheld, but the Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, refused to be moved and the University of Wales received its royal charter with Lampeter firmly excluded. Too late to effect this outcome, Owen established a supplemental charter for the college, re-affirming in the plainest terms that the college existed to  \"receive and educate any person whatsoever, whether destined for Holy Orders or not\". Lampeter was not to be admitted to the university until 1971.\nIn January 1897, William Basil Jones, Bishop of St David's, died and, within six weeks, Owen had been named as his successor. Much of Owen's episcopate was marked by controversy and he was not afraid of confrontation, even so he led the Church in Wales through the difficult disestablishment and become regarded as spokesman for the Welsh church during this time. In private correspondence there was even a suggestion that he should become Wales' first archbishop, but he refused to consider it. In Easter week 1920, he presided over the election of Bishop A.G. Edwards as the first Archbishop of Wales.\nOwen died of a short illness on 4 November 1926 and was buried on 9 November at Abergwili, Carmarthenshire.\nOwen is extremely well documented not least in the press, both denominational and national (in both senses) due to his combative nature and the controversial positions he took. The two volume Life by his daughter, Eluned Owen, is inevitably partial but most readily available.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Owen", "response": ["John Owen may refer to:", "*John Owen (footballer) (1849\u20131921), English footballer and educator", "*John Owen (athlete) (1861\u20131924), American sprinter", "*John Owen (cricketer) (born 1971), English cricketer", "*John Owen (bishop of St Asaph) (1580\u20131651), Bishop of St Asaph, Wales", "*John Owen (theologian) (1616\u20131683), English Nonconformist church leader and theologian", "*John Owen (Dean of Clonmacnoise) (1686\u20131760), Irish Anglican priest", "*John Owen (chancellor of Bangor) (1698\u20131755), Welsh priest and opponent of Methodism", "*John Owen (priest) (1754\u20131824), Archdeacon of Richmond and Chaplain General of the British Armed Forces", "*John Owen (chess player) (1827\u20131901), English vicar and amateur chess player", "*John Owen (bishop of St David's) (1854\u20131926), Bishop of St David's, Principal of St David's College, Lampeter", "*John Owen (theologian) (1616\u20131683), English religious leader and MP for Oxford University", "*John Owen (MP for Caernarvon Boroughs), see Caernarvon Boroughs", "*John Owen (MP for Anglesey and Beaumaris) (died 1754), Welsh politician, represented Anglesey and Beaumaris in Parliament", "*Sir John Owen, 1st Baronet (1776\u20131861), Member of Parliament for Pembroke, 1841\u20131861", "*John Owen (North Carolina politician) (1787\u20131841), Democratic governor of North Carolina from 1828 to 1830", "*John Owen (author) (1952\u20132001), dramatist and director", "*John Owen (epigrammatist) (c. 1564\u20131622), Welsh epigrammatist", "*John Owen (judge), British barrister, High Court judge, and ecclesiastical judge", "*John Owen (Owain Alaw) (1821\u20131883), Welsh musician and composer", "*John Owen (Royal Marines officer) (1777\u20131857)", "*John Owen (Royalist) (1600\u20131666), Welsh Royalist officer during the English Civil War", "*John Owen-Jones (born 1971), Welsh theatre actor", "*John Owens (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Monmouth School for Boys", "response": ["The first headmaster was John Owen, M.A. of Queens' College, Cambridge, appointed on a salary of \u00a360 per annum.
