She was known for her wrestling attire, choosing loose-fitting street clothes similar in style to Homicide, her strike-based style of fighting and her relationship with fellow wrestler JP Monroe.

Volume 13 was also taped which allowed Haze to have her first match against Sarah Stock, which Haze ultimately lost. On Volume 14, Haze and MsChif had their first match against each other for Shimmer (though the two had wrestled in a \"bonus Shimmer attraction match\" before in AAW) which Haze was able to win. Haze wrestled Stock in a number one contender's match on Volume 15, but lost after she was pinned with a Victory roll. On the last Volume of 2007, Volume 16, taped on October 15, Haze joined forces with MsChif and Eden Black to face The International Home Wrecking Crew, consisting of Jetta, Lacey and Rain. Haze pinned Jetta to pick up the win for her team.", "Haze participated in two ChickFight tournaments. Her first came in September 2006 at ChickFight VI in 2006 in which Haze faced the defending champion Cheerleader Melissa in the first round. The two wrestled to a thirty-five-minute draw, which mean that they both advanced to the second round, where they had a three-way match, also involving Allison Danger. Haze won the match, and then defeated KAORU in the finals to win the ChickFight VI tournament.

She made the final in the first two tournaments but exited the third in the first round after a double disqualification during a match with former rival Nikki, now under her better known name Sara Del Rey. Melissa won ChickFight V tournament, beating Jazz in the final, and she also went on to win ChickFight VII: The UK vs The USA tournament when it moved from the United States over to the United Kingdom pinning \"The Jezebel\" Eden Black in the last match. However, the focus of ChickFight VII was on the controversial ending to her first match that saw Sweet Saraya's head hung in the ropes, Anderson continued to assault her despite being trapped until the referee ended the match and Saraya was stretchered from ringside. As Anderson celebrated her tournament victory Saraya reappeared and threatened her. The feud was cut short during a pre-match brawl for Real Quality Wrestling (RQW) in June that saw the two brawl both in and outside of the building and ended with Anderson winning shortly after Saraya was thrown on an already utilized aluminum can, tearing through her ligament and leaving her hospitalized. She was forced to forfeit her ChickFight IX: Our Final Chance match the following day and would not wrestle again for six months.", "Meanwhile, Anderson had begun a new feud. She did not participate in the tournament at ChickFight VIII but instead had a rematch against Eden Black for the newly created Transatlantic Women's Championship, which she won. Later in the show she successfully defended the title against Croatian wrestler Wesna Busic. The two had met years previously when her internet celebrity saw her invited to German Stampede Wrestling to face Wesna in a losing effort at International Impact I. After defending her Transatlantic Championship at ChickFight VII, their next CF meeting saw Wesna defend her RQW Women's Championship fought under ChickFight Rules (no disqualification and falls count anywhere) which saw the two go to a forty-five-minute time limit draw. This left the two at 1\u20131 and so a decisive match was to be held at ChickFight X but this ended in controversy when Wesna claimed that her tap out was merely an attempt to grab the rope for a rope break; their rematch later that night saw Wesna pick up the victory leaving them drawn again at 2\u20132. CF XI was originally slated to be a two out of three falls match to find a decisive victory until Anderson pulled out due to injury.", "The two would meet again three months later in England for RQW's 2007 No Pain, No Gain event challenging Eden Black for the RQW Women's Championship but both came up short. The match served to build up interest for the aforementioned ChickFight VII: The UK vs The USA where Melissa would secure a victory against Black. She also beat MsChif in the semi-final. At RQW's Taking On The World the three met again with MsChif and Black teaming up in a losing effort against Anderson and Black's nemesis Jetta.

The match took place at Caesar\u2019s Beatings on 15 July 2006, in Jezebel's hometown of Romford. Black managed to pick up the victory which did nothing but anger Jetta, who swiftly demanded a rematch. Jetta had her wish on the televised show of 10 September 2006 but she was beaten once again by her rival. Jetta had to wait until Born to be Wyld in November before she could proclaim victory over Eden Black, in a four way elimination match including Skye and Violet. The feud grew into a scheduled mixed tag match at the LDN Anniversary Show including Jetta's manager John Chapman, however the match went to a no contest after Black's partner, JP Monroe, turned on her nine minutes into the match. Skye reclaimed victory from the fatal-four way the following year in a singles match on 14 April.

At the next event, ChickFight IX.5, she berated the Skegness crowd before viciously defeating Skye in two straight falls. Before the night was over she cost Eden Black her contest with Wesna due to interference, leading to a hastily scheduled match between the pair which quickly degenerated into a ringside brawl before Jetta screwed Black, pinning her using the ropes. To top off an already mischievous evening, Jetta then reported Cheerleader Melissa, who was on already on a warning, to the CF management leading to her suspension. She continued to interfere in others' business at 4 May 2008 CF taping; she came to the ring after Melissa and Wesna's fight, defending the losing Wesna claiming company bias due to Melissa's new television fame (Wesna returned the favour by interrupting Jetta vs Melissa, saving Jetta from the Kudo Driver) and later, as Black was announcing her retirement due to a severe shoulder injury, Jetta interrupted and cut a promo demanding The Jezebel recognise Jetta as the real reason she was retiring, this resulted in the two being booked for the main event on 3 August ChickFight card. The event, hampered by injuries, saw Jetta attempt to send a message to Black by squashing Faith Lehain in twenty-eight seconds early in the show but, despite spending most of the match working on The Jezebel's injured and taped up shoulder, Jetta would tap out to the Garden of Eden after a twenty-minute match.", "In what was probably Jetta's biggest match to date, she put her long standing issues with Eden Black aside and both women represented the United Kingdom in a Shimmer Women Athletes guest match, for Ring of Honor (ROH).

Jetta and Jezebel were defeated by United States representatives, Sara Del Rey and Allison Danger, but still managed to show a strong effort against the experienced duo. Jetta would return to the promotion across the pond, becoming a regular for Shimmer tapings from October 2007's Volume 15 where she defeated Serena Deeb. Despite a singles loss to Haze, she still impressed as a singles wrestler by winning the Volume 19 battle royal, entering seventh out of twenty one competitors and earning a Shimmer Championship match later on that same evening; the victory was somewhat tainted, though, as rather than eliminate the final competitor, Ariel was merely pulled out by enraged former champion Del Rey.
