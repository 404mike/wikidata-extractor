Wiley's track \"Wearing My Rolex\", produced by Bless Beats, has been credited for kickstarting this wave of commercialisation, but while it managed to gain a number 2 spot in the official singles chart, many of the initial attempts to replicate this success failed. Tinchy Stryder's \"Stryderman\" only managed to peak of No. 73, while Roll Deep's \"Do Me Wrong\" failed to chart at all. Skepta's \"Rolex Sweep\" only peaked at number 86, although it did briefly start a dance craze after it was released, received a remix by the band Coldplay, and featured on the comedy show Misfits.
