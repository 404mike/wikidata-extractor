He is most widely remembered today as the author of a memoir of his time in the army entitled The Recollections of Rifleman Harris, which has been seen as giving a rare insight into the world of the enlisted man in Wellington's army. Most memoirs published after the war came from serving officers, and the experiences of ordinary soldiers were overlooked due to the illiteracy of so many people at that time.\nHarris himself was illiterate. His recollections were recorded in the 1830s by an officer who knew him, named Captain Henry Curling. Curling himself is the only source for this encounter. Curling later wrote that he kept the manuscript based on their conversation until 1848, when he succeeded in getting it published.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1848 in literature", "response": ["*Benjamin Randell Harris \u2013 The Recollections of Rifleman Harris"]}, {"page": "Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)", "response": ["* Benjamin Randell Harris \u2013 Rifleman and author."]}, {"page": "The Recollections of Rifleman Harris", "response": ["The Recollections of Rifleman Harris is a memoir published in 1848, which claims to reflect the experiences of an enlisted soldier in the 95th Regiment of Foot in the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars. The eponymous soldier was Benjamin Randell Harris, a private who joined the regiment in 1803 and served in many of the early campaigns in the Peninsula War. In the mid-1830s, Harris was working as a cobbler in London when he met an acquaintance, Captain Henry Curling, who asked him to dictate an account of his experiences of army life. This account was then held by Curling until 1848, when he succeeded in getting the manuscript published, preserving one of the very few surviving accounts of military service in this era that claims to have originated with a private soldier. However, as Harris himself was illiterate, it remains unclear how far the text reflects his own views, and how far it reflects the views of Curling, the author of the written account. Even the description of the text's origins comes from Curling, meaning that it is impossible to know what Harris himself actually said or felt about the events the diaries describe."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Harris", "response": ["*Benjamin Randell Harris (1781\u2013?), British infantryman"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Harris (rifleman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Randell Harris"]}, {"page": "List of Sharpe series characters", "response": ["The character was named in tribute to Benjamin Randell Harris, of the 95th Rifles, whose memoir, The Recollections of Rifleman Harris, about his experiences during the peninsular campaign, was a major source for Cornwell's original research for the Sharpe novels (an audio version of the book was recorded by Salkey)."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Benjamin Randell Harris, soldier, was born in Portsea, Portsmouth"]}]}}
