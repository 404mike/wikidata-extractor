The plot follows an atheist teenager attending Christian school. After publicly insulting his classmates' religion to get back at a girl he was interested in who did not return his romantic feelings, the boy attracts the attention of a maltheist and is coerced into helping him murder clergy and bomb churches. Following the death of maltheist, the book ends with the atheistic hero willingly carrying out a shooting at his Christian school. In the introduction to the Vertigo edition, Ennis described this as wish-fulfillment. Shortly after, Ennis began to write for the UK comics series 2000 AD, and later wrote stories for the title's flagship character, Judge Dredd, taking over from creator John Wagner for several years. Ennis' Dredd stories include \"Muzak Killer\", a pastiche of mainstream pop music; \"Emerald Isle\", a tongue-in-cheek story set in Ennis' native Ireland; and the 20-part \"Judgment Day\". Ennis also contributed the story \"Time Flies\", with artist Philip Bond, dealing with time-travel paradoxes and Nazis."]}, {"page": "American Splendor", "response": ["|  (38) Vol 2 3 || Aug 2008 || 36 || John Cebollero, Darwyn Cooke, Geary, Haspiel, Sean Murphy, Neufeld, Warren Pleece, Samnee || Vertigo"]}, {"page": "The Invisibles", "response": ["** Issues #12\u20139: Philip Bond, Warren Pleece"]}, {"page": "Mike Carey (writer)", "response": ["*Lucifer (with Chris Weston (#1\u20133), Warren Pleece (#4), Peter Gross, Dean Ormston, David Hahn (#41), Ted Naifeh (#45), P.
