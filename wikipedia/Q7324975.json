Nevertheless, the defining characteristic of Brighton and Hove's religious architecture is the exceptional range of richly designed, landmark Victorian churches\u2014particularly those built for the Anglican community. The city's stock of such churches is one of the best outside London: this is attributable to the influence of fashionable society and the money it brought, and to the efforts of two Vicars of Brighton, Henry Michell Wagner and his son Arthur, to endow and build new churches throughout Brighton's rapidly developing suburbs and poor districts.  Both men were rich and were willing to pay for well-designed, attractive and even flamboyant buildings by well-known architects such as Benjamin Ferrey, Richard Cromwell Carpenter and George Frederick Bodley.  An early preference for the Classical style, as at Christ Church (now demolished) and St John the Evangelist's at Carlton Hill, gave way to various forms of Gothic Revival design\u2014principally in the starkly plain form of the gigantic St Bartholomew's Church and the even larger St Martin's, whose fixtures and furnishings are classed among the best in England. However, Charles Barry's imposingly sited St Paul's Church (1824), which began the Gothic trend, was not commissioned by the Wagners; nor were Hove's new parish church, the Grade I-listed All Saints (1889\u201391) or Cliftonville's St Barnabas' (1882\u201383), both by John Loughborough Pearson. St Michael and All Angels Church, built in two stages by Bodley (1858\u201361) and William Burges (1893\u201395), was established by Rev. Charles Beanlands, a curate under Arthur Wagner at St Paul's.  The two parts, in different interpretations of the Gothic Revival style, harmonise well, and the interior (mostly by W. H. Romaine-Walker) is one of the city's grandest. The present St Mary the Virgin Church is the second on the site: Amon Henry Wilds's Classical building collapsed during renovation and was replaced in 1877\u201379 by William Emerson's \"dynamic\" Early English/French Gothic design\u2014his only church in England.", "Also characteristic of the Victorian era was the rebuilding or restoration of the area's ancient churches.  Richard Cromwell Carpenter rebuilt St Nicholas' Church from a ruined state in 1853\u201354, and Somers Clarke did more work in 1876. George Basevi carried out an \"uninspiring\" neo-Norman revamp of the 13th-century St Andrew's Church in the 1830s, James Woodman and Ewan Christian \"over-restored\" St Peter's Church at Preston Village in 1872 and 1878, and the 11th- and 12th-century St Peter's Church at West Blatchington was initially rebuilt by Somers Clarke in 1888\u201391 and comprehensively extended in 1960 in a complementary style by John Leopold Denman. The partly Saxon St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean (the city's oldest building) was altered in the 1860s, although the overwhelming impression is that of a 12th-century Downland village church; and similar work was carried out at St Helen's Church in Hangleton in the 1870s, which nevertheless \"retains its medieval character\"."]}, {"page": "List of demolished places of worship in Brighton and Hove", "response": ["|Richard Cromwell Carpenter designed this flint and stone church in the Decorated Gothic style for Reverend Henry Michell Wagner.

In 1841 the partition was removed and plans for a separate parish church were supported by Chandler. After a public appeal, Richard Cromwell Carpenter was appointed as architect and the church built in 1848\u201352. Chandler provided funds for the pews in the new church out of his own pocket.

In some cases vast rural parishes were subdivided; in others, chapels of ease were provided in outlying rural areas distant from their parish church.  Victorian restoration of old churches took place across the district and was particularly extensive at Hailsham, Selmeston and Uckfield, where the buildings are now essentially 19th-century.  The era of large-scale churchbuilding (as opposed to restoration) in Wealden began in the late Georgian era with the opening of a new church in Frant, built between 1819 and 1822.  The year 1836, just before Victoria's reign started, was significant: William Moseley was responsible for new churches in Forest Row and Hadlow Down that year (although the latter was greatly reworked in 1913); and Danehill, a main-road village in Fletching parish, also received its first chapel of ease in 1836.  The present church of 1892 is by Bodley and Garner.  It is the Victorian era that is most associated with the increase in churchbuilding activity, though.Elleray 1981, p. 22.  A church in the outlying part of Withyham parish close to the growing town of Crowborough opened in 1839.  Four years later, a church was completed at Upper Dicker in Arlington parish; and prolific architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter's church at Nutley dates from 1845.  The churches at Eridge and Tidebrook date from 1852 and 1856 respectively.  James Piers St Aubyn designed a chapel of ease at Cross-in-Hand, the main settlement in Waldron parish, in 1863\u201364.  A former school was converted into a chapel of ease in Mark Cross, part of Rotherfield parish, in 1873, although it was soon granted its own parish.  A year later, work began on a church for the rapidly growing village of Polegate, and a church was built to serve the village of Horam in 1890.  Endowments by rich benefactors allowed churches to be built at High Hurstwood (1872) and Hammerwood (1880).  The wealthy Vicar of Brighton Arthur Wagner, who had a house in Buxted and established a convent there, also paid for the construction of a second church for the village in 1885\u201386.  Fairwarp's church, designed in 1881 by Major Rohde Hawkins, was substantially extended in the 20th century, funded by the Eckstein baronets.  Churches continued to be built throughout the 20th century.  Examples include Blackham (1902), Jarvis Brook (1906), Colemans Hatch (1913, by Arthur Blomfield), Heathfield town (1915), Bodle Street Green (1923, replacing a fire-damaged one), Stone Cross (1924; a chapel of ease in Westham parish), Alderbrook (1957), Broad Oak (1959), Lower Willingdon (1962) and Pevensey Bay (1968, replacing one of 1881).  In the east of Uckfield a tin tabernacle erected in 1904 was replaced by a combined church and sheltered housing development in 1971.", "|Richard Cromwell Carpenter, who was responsible for many Gothic Revival churches, was commissioned to design Nutley's church in 1845.
