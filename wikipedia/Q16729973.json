Binding neurons learn to represent the hierarchical binding relationships between lower and higher level visual features in the hierarchy of visual primitives, at every spatial scale and across the entire visual field. This observation is consistent with the hierarchical nature of primate vision proposed by the two neuroscientists John Duncan and Glyn W. Humphreys almost thirty years ago. "]}]}}
