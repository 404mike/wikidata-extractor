It was during this game that Holt got an insight into the dire state of Stanley, having discovered that the club's bar was unable to serve spectators as a result of its failure to pay its suppliers. In his first season as owner of the club, the 2015-16 Football League Two season, the club narrowly missed out on promotion to League One on the final day of the season, having been held to a 0-0 draw with Stevenage. Stanley were then defeated in the semi-final of the League Two play-offs, losing 3-2 on aggregate to AFC Wimbledon, with Wimbledon going on to defeat Plymouth Argyle 2-0 in the play-off final. At the end of the season, Stanley lost several of its players who had helped spur them on a promotion push, such as Tom Davies, Ross Etheridge and Josh Windass, who had agreed contracts with clubs in a position to offer higher wages than Stanley had been able to. With Windass and Crooks being under-24, Stanley received \u00a3120,000 for the duo's transfer to Rangers."]}, {"page": "Southport F.C.", "response": ["*Tom Davies\u00a0\u2013 Bristol Rovers"]}, {"page": "Thomas Davies", "response": ["*Tom Davies (born 1990), better known as GeoWizard", "*Tom Davies (American football) (1896\u20131972), American football player and coach", "*Tom Davies (footballer) (fl. 1899\u20131903), English footballer who played for Burslem Port Vale", "*Tom Davies (footballer, born 1882) (1882\u20131967), English footballer who played for Swindon Town, Nottingham Forest, Reading and Southampton", "*Tom Davies (footballer, born 1992), English professional footballer", "*Tom Davies (footballer, born 1998), English professional footballer", "*Tom Davies (rugby union, born 1986), Welsh rugby union player", "*Tom Davies (rugby union, born 1993), Welsh rugby union player", "*Tom Davies (rugby league) (born 1997), English rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "Tommy Widdrington", "response": ["Widdrington was appointed head of recruitment at Coventry City on 10 April 2017.
