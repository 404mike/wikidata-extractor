On 1 July, a Cabinet level meeting arranged the formation of a single sabotage organisation. On 16 July, Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, was appointed to take political responsibility for the new organisation, which was formally created on 22 July 1940.  Dalton recorded in his diary that on that day the War Cabinet agreed to his new duties and that Churchill had told him, \"And now go and set Europe ablaze.\" Dalton used the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence as a model for the organisation.Hugh Dalton letter to Lord Halifax 2 July 1940; quoted in M.

She may have been recruited by the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), and turned away from her espionage duties in order to help Allied soldiers escape, although this is not widely accepted. Rankin cites the published statement of M. R. D. Foot, historian and Second World War British intelligence officer, as to Cavell having been part of SIS or MI6. The former director-general of MI5, Stella Rimington, announced in 2015 that she had unearthed documents in Belgian military archives that confirmed an intelligence gathering aspect to Cavell's network.
