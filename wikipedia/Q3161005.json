He went on to develop a system of clinical exams to diagnose and treat soft tissue lesions, indicated by assessing body movements; this was his most well-known contribution to medicine. In 1943, he earned the Heberden prize for his essay on the pathology and treatment of elbow sprains. He founded the Association of Manipulative Medicine and later the Cyriax Foundation, which has since shut down, to promote orthopedic medical education.He was appointed a Member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1954. Later in his career, he was a visiting professor at the University of Rochester in the United States. He was considered a controversial figure during his lifetime both for his personality and his views on medicine.Cyriax developed a series of simple objective clinical exams that would effectively diagnose soft tissue musculoskeletal lesions. His collected results, after many years of trial and error, coalesced into a set of systematic simple clinical exams for each joint and a treatment system for the soft tissue lesions around each joint. Cyriax's Rule states that pain with both active range of motion and passive range of motion in the same direction points to inert tissue dysfunction (ligament, capsular, cartilage). Pain with active range of motion in one direction and pain with passive range of motion in the opposite direction signal contractile tissue dysfunction.\nCyriax's papers are held at the Wellcome Library.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rajneesh", "response": ["In 1981, the increased tensions around the Pune ashram, along with criticism of its activities and threatened punitive action by Indian authorities, provided an impetus for the ashram to consider the establishment of a new commune in the United States., reprinted in Guru in Cowboy Country, in: Asia Week, 29 July 1983, pp. 26\u201336 According to Susan J. Palmer, the move to the United States was a plan from Sheela., reprinted in Gordon (1987) notes that Sheela and Rajneesh had discussed the idea of establishing a new commune in the US in late 1980, although he did not agree to travel there until May 1981. On 1 June that year he travelled to the United States on a tourist visa, ostensibly for medical purposes, and spent several months at a Rajneeshee retreat centre located at Kip's Castle in Montclair, New Jersey. He had been diagnosed with a prolapsed disc in early 1981 and treated by several doctors, including James Cyriax, a St. Thomas' Hospital musculoskeletal physician and expert in epidural injections flown in from London. Rajneesh's previous secretary, Laxmi, reported to Frances FitzGerald that \"she had failed to find a property in India adequate to Rajneesh's needs, and thus, when the medical emergency came, the initiative had passed to Sheela\". A public statement by Sheela indicated that Rajneesh was in grave danger if he remained in India, but would receive appropriate medical treatment in America if he needed surgery. Despite the stated serious nature of the situation Rajneesh never sought outside medical treatment during his time in the United States, leading the Immigration and Naturalization Service to contend that he had a preconceived intent to remain there. Years later, Rajneesh pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, while maintaining his innocence of the charges that he made false statements on his initial visa application about his alleged intention to remain in the US when he came from India.\"His lawyers, however, were already negotiating with the United States Attorney's office and, on 14 November he returned to Portland and pleaded guilty to two felonies; making false statements to the immigration authorities in 1981 and concealing his intent to reside in the United States.\" ()\"The Bhagwan may also soon need his voice to defend himself on charges he lied on his original temporary-visa application: if the immigration service proves he never intended to leave, the Bhagwan could be deported.\" (Newsweek, Bhagwan's Realm: The Oregon cult with the leader with 90 golden Rolls Royces, 3 December 1984, United States Edition, National Affairs Pg. 34, 1915 words, Neal Karlen with Pamela Abramson in Rajneeshpuram.)\"Facing 35 counts of conspiring to violate immigration laws, the guru admitted two charges: lying about his reasons for settling in the U.S. and arranging sham marriages to help foreign disciples join him.\" (American Notes, Time, Monday, November 1985, available here )"]}, {"page": "Swedes in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*James Cyriax: doctor known as the \"father of orthopedic medicine.\", Swedish descent."]}, {"page": "James Henry Cyriax", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Cyriax"]}, {"page": "Cyriax, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Cyriax"]}, {"page": "Edgar Ferdinand Cyriax", "response": ["In 1899 Cyriax married Annjuta (Anna) Kellgren, daughter of Jonas Henrik Kellgren, Cyriax's mentor.
