In her lifetime she was best known for her canine portraits, some of which were commissioned by royalty and aristocracy. She was known as \"the Lady Landseer\" for the quality of her work. She travelled to the Americas, France, and Switzerland, returning with watercolour landscape sketches.\nFairman was born in Kent and studied under Louis Henri Deschamps in Paris, but for most of her life lived and worked in London. When she was in her late 50s, she was taken to court and fined for attempting to prevent a hansom cab driver from whipping his horse in Fulham Road, London, and for striking the cabman with her hand after he had hit her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Borzoi", "response": ["File:Borzoi by Frances C.
