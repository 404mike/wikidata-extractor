He scored his first aerial victory on 7 May 1918, and continued to string out a dozen wins stretching through 3 September 1918; he teamed up to share victories with such fellow aces as Alfred Williams Carter and Clement W. Payton in several cases. On 10 August he was appointed a flight commander, with its accompanying temporary promotion to captain. On 21 September, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Three days later, he was wounded in action. He recovered in time to round off his victory string with a final win on 30 October 1918. Three days later, he was granted a Bar to his DFC in lieu of a second award. In the final analysis, Joseph had destroyed five enemy aircraft by himself, shared in destroying two others, drove three down out of control, and teamed up to drive another one down out of combat. He also was a balloon buster, being one of three pilots responsible for destroying a German observation balloon."]}, {"page": "Payton (surname)", "response": ["*Clement W.
