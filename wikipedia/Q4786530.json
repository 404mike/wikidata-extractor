The gallery, first managed by Ernest Brown (later founder of Leicester Galleries) has for many years largely concentrated on British art and design from 1600 to the present day; with the Edinburgh premises specialising in Scottish art of the same period. The Edinburgh branch of the company is directed by Emily Walsh.  The Chairmen were all drawn from the Longman family until the death of Mark Longman in 1972. Since then only Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden KT (until 1998), Sir Angus Grossart (until 2016) and Robin Holland-Martin (current) have held the position. Only seven people have held the position of Managing Director in the past 139 years, the last being Pippa Stockdale."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1857 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Archibald Stuart-Wortley||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Archibald Stuart-Wortley", "response": ["Archibald Stuart-Wortley may refer to:", "*Archibald Stuart-Wortley (politician) (1832-1890), MP for Honiton", "*Archibald Stuart-Wortley (painter) (1849-1905), British painter"]}, {"page": "Archibald Henry Plantagenet Stuart-Wortley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archibald Stuart-Wortley (politician)"]}]}}
