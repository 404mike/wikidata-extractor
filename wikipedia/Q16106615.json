The contemporary art of Wales is noted perhaps more for its variety, rather than having a single set agenda. However, perhaps due to market forces or the inspirational shapes and changing light, the Welsh landscape is still particularly well represented in commercial galleries throughout Wales and beyond, either through the expressive, almost abstract, techniques used by artists like David Tress or the more traditional approaches used by others like Rob Piercy."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"E\"", "response": ["*Ken Elias (born 1944), Welsh artist"]}, {"page": "University of South Wales", "response": ["* Ken Elias, artist"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh artists", "response": ["*Ken Elias (born 1944), painter born in Glynneath"]}, {"page": "The Welsh Group", "response": ["* Ken Elias"]}]}}
