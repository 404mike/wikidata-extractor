(14 July 1862 \u2013 21 April 1952) was a Scottish surgeon working in Edinburgh, with a particular interest in urological surgery. During the Boer War he was in charge of the Edinburgh South African Hospital, an experience which impressed upon him the importance of the Red Cross movement in reducing and mitigating the horrors of war. Becoming active in the British Red Cross Society, he was instrumental in forming the Edinburgh branch and was its Chairman for over 30 years.  He was knighted in 1920 and elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1921.", "link_mentions": {}}}
