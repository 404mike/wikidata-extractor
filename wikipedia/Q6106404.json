Beginning in 1919, he mounted new seasons in London with new set and costume designs, while continuing the year-round tours in Britain and abroad. With the help of the director J. M. Gordon and the conductor Isidore Godfrey, Carte ran the company for 35 years. He redesigned the Savoy Theatre in 1928 and sponsored a series of recordings over the years that helped to keep the operas popular. After Rupert's death in 1948, his daughter Bridget inherited the company and hired Frederic Lloyd as general manager. The company continued to tour for 35 weeks each year, issue new recordings and play London seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan. In 1961 the last copyright on the Gilbert and Sullivan operas expired, and Bridget set up and endowed a charitable trust that presented the operas until mounting costs and a lack of public funding forced the closure of the company in 1982. It re-formed in 1988 with a legacy left by Bridget D'Oyly Carte, played short tours and London seasons, and issued some popular recordings. Denied significant funding from the English Arts Council, it suspended productions in 2003. With Scottish Opera, it co-produced The Pirates of Penzance 2013 and The Mikado in 2016.", "After Gilbert's death in 1911, the company continued to produce productions of the operas in repertory until 1982. In 1911, Helen Carte hired J. M. Gordon as stage manager. Gordon, who was promoted to stage director in 1922,Rollins and Witts, p. ii had been a member of the company and a stage manager under Gilbert's direction, and he fiercely preserved the company's performing traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.Stone, David (ed). J M Gordon at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, accessed 21 December 2009 Except for Ruddigore, which underwent some cuts and received a new overture,Cox and Box was cut and arranged into a short curtain raiser very few changes were made to the text and music of the operas as Gilbert and Sullivan had produced them, and the company stayed true to Gilbert's period settings. Even after Gordon's death, many of Gilbert's directorial concepts survived, both in the stage directions printed in the libretti and as preserved in company prompt books. Original choreography was also maintained.See, for instance, 1882 images of the Act II trio in Iolanthe in Mander and Michenson, p. 65 and 1974 images of the same scene on the sleeve of D'Oyly Carte recording, Decca SKL 5188/9 Some of the company's staging became accepted as traditional by Gilbert and Sullivan fans, and many of these traditional stagings are still imitated today in productions by both amateur and professional companies.Bradley (2005), p. 61\"Patricia Leonard: principal contralto of the D\u2019Oyly Carte opera\" .

Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could be taken as a Fagin-like caricature.  According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, \"I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me\", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J. M. Gordon his new business for the song, they were delighted. Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 premi\u00e8re, was unimpressed: \"Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [by Fancourt's teacher, Richard Temple] at the Savoy.\"Bond, Chapter 14, accessed 4 April 2009  The Times thought that he \"undoubtedly loses a good deal of the Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'.\"The Times, 21 September 1926, p. 12 A later Times review commented more favourably: \"Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs.\"The Times, 25 October 1932, p. 12 The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, \"He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor.\"The Manchester Guardian, 16 November 1920, p. 6 The Pall Mall Gazette said, \"Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with a voice like a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated.\"Bettany, unnumbered page Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as \"a dragon getting up steam\". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, \"The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it\"."]}, {"page": "Rupert D'Oyly Carte", "response": ["After London seasons in 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309, the opera company did not perform in the West End again until 1919, although it continued to tour in Great Britain.  According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, \"Through the years of the Great War they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere. They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory.\"Walbrook, p. 125 Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, \"I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London. I thought the dresses looked dowdy . . . I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a d\u00e9cor attractive to the new generation.\"Baily, p. 430.
