Farrell won the lead role over younger actors Garrett Hedlund, Tom Hiddleston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Although the film generally received negative reviews due to the overly romantic nature of the film, writers such as The Village Voices Stephanie Zacharek had nothing but praise for Farrell. She described him as \"an extraordinary appealing actor\" who \"has always made a terrific bad boy, but ... seems to be settling into some very serious, responsible-adult roles.\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed, writing that Farrell \"holds the movie together\" and is part of \"the most beautiful [love scene] so far of 2014.\""]}]}}
