Jack Fallows stood in as captain for the season. His successor, Ken Cranston, was an unusual choice as he had no prior first-class experience; despite this his captaincy was not unsuccessful as Lancashire finished third and fifth during his two years in charge. In 1947 Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place both scored over 2,500\u00a0runs and scored 19\u00a0centuries between them. Washbrook's benefit took place in August 1948 and was watched by 50,000 people; he received \u00a314,000 (\u00a3 in ), beating the previous record by over \u00a310,000. Despite finishing 11th in 1949, in 1950\u00a0\u2013 under the captaincy of Nigel Howard\u00a0\u2013 Lancashire shared the county championship with Surrey, winning 16 matches; Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton claimed nearly 300\u00a0wickets between them. The 1950 season marked the emergence of Brian Statham. In the following three seasons, Lancashire finished third each time.
