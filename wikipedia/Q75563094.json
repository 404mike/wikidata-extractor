The architect is believed to have been Sir Edward Lovett Pearce. The house was a Palladian two-storey core building with a basement, linked to two-storey wings. Inside there were elaborate plasterwork ceilings and notable staircases described as \"handsome carved scroll-work in oak, in lieu of balusters\". The house was considered a superlative example, however it was destroyed in February 1923 when it was burned by the IRA. A new house was rebuilt by Lady Kathleen Milborne-Swinnerton-Pilkington, with Richard Orpen but this was subsequently torn down in 1957."]}]}}
