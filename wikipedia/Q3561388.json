Moon's early style was influenced by jazz, American surf music and rhythm and blues, exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer Hal Blaine. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly Gene Krupa (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied). Moon also admired Elvis Presley's original drummer DJ Fontana, the Shadows' original drummer Tony Meehan and the Pretty Things' Viv Prince. He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in Motown. Moon idolised the Beach Boys; Roger Daltrey later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even at the peak of the Who's fame."]}, {"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Viv Prince (Pretty Things)"]}, {"page": "Mitch Mitchell", "response": ["Early in his career he gained considerable musical experience as a touring and session musician, working with Pete Nelson and the Travellers, Frankie Reid and the Casuals (1962), Johnny Harris and the Shades, the Pretty Things, Bill Knight & the Sceptres, the Riot Squad, and the Who as a session drummer while the band was in the process of replacing Doug Sandom with Keith Moon.

Alder helped out on at least two tracks, one of which was \"You'll Never Do It Baby\". Jimmy Page, then a prominent session musician, was occasionally involved in the recordings, receiving a partial writing credit on \"You Don't Believe Me.\" The album did see the band starting to move away from the staunch R&B direction that dominated the first album, exploring more soulful areas as well as Freakbeat with much use of distortion on guitar and bass parts.", "Recorded on three-track tape at Philips Studios in London, the album was only mixed in mono.
