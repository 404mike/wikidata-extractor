Immediately afterwards, he appeared against Sussex at the same venue, but only 58 overs were possible and his only contribution was five wicketless overs for 19 runs.\nHis next first-class appearance was not for almost two years, and when he did play again in June 1922 it was for a very weak Worcestershire side destined to finish bottom of the County Championship. His second game for his new county, against Northamptonshire at Worcester, brought him his first wicket (that of John Howman) and indeed what were to remain his best bowling figures of 3-74.\nNorton played four more times for Worcestershire, but the county lost them all: indeed, in his eight-match first-class career he was never part of a winning side. His final game was his only appearance of 1923, at Gravesend against Kent, and in an eight-wicket defeat his ten overs went without reward.\nNorton was born in Sparkbrook, Birmingham; he died in Five Ways, also Birmingham, at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Willmott Norton", "response": ["#Redirect Ernest Norton (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Ernest Norton", "response": ["Ernest Norton may refer to:", "* Ernest Norton (cricketer) (1889\u20131972), English cricketer", "* Ernest Norton (RAF officer) (1893\u20131966), British World War I flying ace"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Ernest Norton (cricketer) (1920) : E.
