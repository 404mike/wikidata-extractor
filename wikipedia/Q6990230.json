Sims, which ran in a double bill with a burlesque called Vulcan, until May. They were followed by a spoof called The Wreck of the Pinafore by  H. Lingard and Luscombe Searelle, described by The Era as \"curious and impudent\", which ran until October. During the rest of the 1880s a succession of managements presented a wide range of genres, from adaptations of French plays, Shakespeare, Sheridan, Ibsen, and a Dickens adaptation by the novelist's son, to musical shows, including The Fay o' Fire by Edward Jones and Henry Herman, which The Era later described as \"notable as introducing Miss Marie Tempest to the regular stage\".

However, as George McElroy noted, the advertisement does not mention a librettist, a peculiar omission if it was to have been W. S. Gilbert, since Gilbert was, at that point, better known to London theatregoers than Sullivan.  Moreover, Trial has no place for two principal ladies, but The Zoo does.  McElroy demonstrated that the January advertisement definitely was not for Trial, when he discovered a further advertisement in The Era of 14 March 1875, which noted that \"In consequence of the continued success of La P\u00e9richole, the production of Mr. Sullivan's two-act opera is postponed.\"McElroy, p. 40  That two-act work must have been something entirely different from Trial by Jury, which is in one act, and which opened just eleven days later.

However, Trial has no place for two principal ladies. McElroy and others conclude that Sullivan was writing a two-act opera for the Royalty that was abandoned, and the music was soon re-used in Sullivan's The Zoo, which has roles for two women. The Zoo played at another London theatre later in 1875 and at the Royalty in 1879 (McElroy, pp. 39\u201354). In any event, Bromley played the sole female principal role in Trial, not Dolaro. Sullivan conducted the opening night performance of Trial on 25 March, but Dolaro's father generally conducted the orchestra thereafter until the end of its initial run on 12 June 1875.Burgess, Michael. \"Richard D'Oyly Carte\", The Savoyard, January 1975, pp. 7\u201311"]}, {"page": "Nellie Bromley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nelly Bromley"]}, {"page": "Les brigands", "response": ["An earlier English version by H.
