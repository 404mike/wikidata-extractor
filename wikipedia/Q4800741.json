Along with fellow half-backs Reg Attwell and captain Alan Brown, full-backs Harry Mather and Arthur Woodruff and goalkeeper Jimmy Strong, Bray was part of the Burnley defence known as the \"Iron Curtain\". The team conceded only 29 league goals during the 1946\u201347 season, the second lowest ever, as they finished as Second Division runners-up to Manchester City, thereby gaining promotion to the First Division. Bray appeared in all but one of the side's matches during the campaign and also played nine matches in the FA Cup as Burnley reached the final of the competition for the first time since 1914. He was selected in the starting line-up for the final but could not prevent opponents Charlton Athletic achieving a 1\u20130 victory."]}]}}
