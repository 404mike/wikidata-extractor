The club were hit by financial troubles after being told they had to pay fines totalling \u00a3250,000, and at one point were at risk of being wound up. As a result, Horton was forced to cope without assistant John Askey, after Askey was dismissed to cut costs. The sale of top-scorer Jon Parkin also robbed Horton of his best player. Following a poor start to the season he placed four players on the transfer-list. He also placed Kevin Townson on the transfer-list, before sacking the striker after Townson displayed \"serious misconduct\". Throughout the campaign, Horton signed goalkeeper Tommy Lee, striker Clyde Wijnhard, midfielder Alan Navarro, forward Allan Russell, and striker Matty McNeil. The \"Silkmen\" finished in 17th-place, five points above the relegation zone. Horton prepared for the 2006\u201307 campaign by searching for a new midfield player, and found one in Shrewsbury Town's Jamie Tolley. He also signed versatile attacker Colin Heath, defender Carl Regan, and former Port Vale goalkeeper Jonny Brain; whilst releasing five players. Horton was sacked in October 2006, after his team failed to win any of their opening twelve league games, leaving them bottom of the Football League."]}, {"page": "David Edwards (footballer, born 1986)", "response": ["Born in Pontesbury, Shropshire, Edwards started as an apprentice at his hometown club, Shrewsbury Town, and made his professional debut in the final match of 2002\u201303 season as an 83rd-minute substitute for Jamie Tolley in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Scunthorpe United on 3 May 2003, as Shrewsbury were relegated from the Football League."]}, {"page": "1983 in Wales", "response": ["*12 May - Jamie Tolley, footballer"]}, {"page": "Tolley", "response": ["* Jamie Tolley (born 1983), Welsh soccer player"]}, {"page": "2004 Football Conference play-off Final", "response": ["Aldershot had the first real chance of the game when Roscoe Dsane got on the end of a ball over the top of the defence and held off Shrews captain Darren Tinson, only to drag his shot wide.
