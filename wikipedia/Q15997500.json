She married Henry Lytton, who eventually became the company's longstanding principal comedian.\nHenri's career got off to an early start when she joined Florence St. John's Opera Company at the age of 15, but she left that troupe to help start her husband's acting career.  Together, they struggled to establish more secure careers in the theatre and eventually obtained steady employment in D'Oyly Carte touring companies.  Henri was promoted to play the leading mezzo-soprano roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and the other productions of the company for about a decade.  However, in 1898, after her husband became a principal player in the main company at the Savoy Theatre, Henri retired from the stage at the age of 34.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 in music", "response": ["*May 2 \u2013 Louie Henri, singer and actress, 83"]}, {"page": "Jessie Matthews", "response": ["In 1926, aged 18, she married the first of her three husbands, the 19 year-old actor Henry Lytton, Jr., the son of singer and actress Louie Henri and Sir Henry Lytton, the doyen of the Savoy Theatre.
