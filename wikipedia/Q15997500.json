She married Henry Lytton, who eventually became the company's longstanding principal comedian.\nHenri's career got off to an early start when she joined Florence St. John's Opera Company at the age of 15, but she left that troupe to help start her husband's acting career.  Together, they struggled to establish more secure careers in the theatre and eventually obtained steady employment in D'Oyly Carte touring companies.  Henri was promoted to play the leading mezzo-soprano roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and the other productions of the company for about a decade.  However, in 1898, after her husband became a principal player in the main company at the Savoy Theatre, Henri retired from the stage at the age of 34.", "link_mentions": {}}}
