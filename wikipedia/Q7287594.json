Newport, as vice-admiral, commanded Sea Venture, the new flagship of the Company, which had been specially built for the purpose. It was considerably larger than the other eight ships, and carried a large proportion of the supplies intended for the colony. Also aboard the new flagship were Admiral Sir George Somers, William Strachey, Sylvester Jourdain, Ralph Hamor, and Sir Thomas Gates, people notable in the early history of English colonization in North America.

Jamestown Narratives: Eyewitness Accounts of the Virginia Colony: The First Decade: 1607-1617.

It would coincide with any source which stated that William Spencer, rather than William Spence, arrived at Jamestown in 1607 on the Susan Constant, but not with usual accounts of either Spence's or Spencer's arrivals and not with online Susan Constant passenger lists which include neither name. Martha McCartney states, with citations, at McCartney, 2007, p. 661 that Spence arrived in the First Supply mission and at p. 662 that Spencer arrived in the \"Sarah or Susan Constant.\" The Susan Constant has occasionally been referred to erroneously as the \"Sarah Constant\", as noted in Grizzard, Frank E. and Dennis Boyd Smith.

Sarah versus Susan. The William and Mary Quarterly 16, No. 4, 1936. pages 515-21. Also, the phrase \"Sarah or\" from McCartney may not require the interpretation that it is referencing different names for the Susan Constant since a ship named the Sara(h) arrived at Jamestown in August 1611 with the returning Sir Thomas Gates (governor).
