The effect was to move barnacles from the phylum of Mollusca to Articulata, showing naturalists that detailed study was needed to reevaluate their taxonomy."]}, {"page": "John Thompson", "response": ["* John Vaughan Thompson (1779\u20131847), British biologist"]}, {"page": "Second voyage of HMS Beagle", "response": ["Beagle touched at Madeira for a confirmed position without stopping.
