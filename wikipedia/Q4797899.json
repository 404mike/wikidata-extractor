Although frequently a reserve throughout his career Bacon managed an impressive strike rate with 71 league goals in 128 games.\nAfter playing his youth football with New Tupton Ivanhoe Bacon signed for Chesterfield but failed to make an appearance at the club before a move to Derby County. Bacon failed to gain a first-team place at Derby and an equally unproductive spell at Manchester City followed before he joined Reading. He became a prolific scorer at Elm Park and even hit six goals in a 7\u20133 win over Stoke City during the 1930-31 season, which stands as the club record for the most goals by one player in a match.Bacon returned to Chesterfield for the 1932-33 season, although he managed only six goals in 30 league appearances. Following this he enjoyed a productive spell at Coventry City, where his former Derby teammate Harry Storer Jr. was the manager. After Storer added Bacon to his squad in 1933 the striker promptly scored 14 goals over four games, all in the space of 15 days. Despite this he found opportunities at Highfield Road limited and dropped out of the Football League in 1935 to finish his career at Burton Town.\nDuring the Second World War Bacon reportedly served as a War reserve constable in Derby, however his occupation was with the Rolls Royce factory where he was a fireman. He was killed, aged 37, in Hawthorn Street during an air-raid on 27 July 1942. There is some dispute as to whether he was a victim of the bombs or one of those machine-gunned from the attacking aircraft.\nHe is commemorated on the memorial in the Chesterfield FC Memorial Garden at the Chesterfield Proact Stadium based on his death while serving in uniform.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reading F.C.", "response": ["*Most league goals in a game: Arthur Bacon (6 vs. Stoke City; 1930\u201331)", "The player with the most league appearances is Martin Hicks, with 500 from 1978 to 1991.

Many fans at the time believed that the war had robbed the team of a probable promotion to the first division, although there was some evidence that the team was already beginning to decline by 1939. Coventry continued playing some friendly games until November 1940, when the Coventry Blitz damaged the stadium and brought all football in the city to a halt. Friendly matches resumed again in 1942, as parts of Highfield Road had been rebuilt, and the team joined the Midland Regional League. The only player connected with the club to be killed during the war was Arthur Bacon, who had played for City until 1935, but the successful team of the 1930s would nonetheless not reform.
