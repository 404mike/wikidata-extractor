Tintin scholars have claimed Herg\u00e9 did not develop the names Syldavia and Borduria himself; instead, the country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of the British Journal of Psychology, in which the author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power. Reportedly, the paper, by Lewis Fry Richardson and entitled \"General Foreign Policy\", explored the nature of inter-state conflict in a mathematical way. Peeters attributed these claims to Georges Laurenceau, but said that \"no researcher has confirmed this source\". Instead, a paper by Richardson entitled \"Generalized Foreign Politics: A Story in Group Psychology\" was published in The British Journal of Psychology Monograph Supplements in 1939, but did not mention Syldavia or Borduria.

In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by Lewis Fry Richardson describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used (see Fig. 1). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick. There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale: see the section Examples."]}, {"page": "Computational fluid dynamics", "response": ["One of the earliest type of calculations resembling modern CFD are those by Lewis Fry Richardson, in the sense that these calculations used finite differences and divided the physical space in cells.
