It can lead to political stability which leads, in turn, to economic growth. Historian Patrick Allitt of the Teaching Company suggested that it is difficult to overestimate the long-term economic benefits of political stability. Sometimes two-party systems have been seen as preferable to multi-party systems because they are simpler to govern, with less fractiousness and greater harmony, since it discourages radical minor parties, while multi-party systems can sometimes lead to hung parliaments. Italy, with a multi-party system, has had years of divisive politics since 2000, although analyst Silvia Aloisi suggested in 2008 that the nation may be moving closer to a two-party arrangement. The two-party has been identified as simpler since there are fewer voting choices."]}, {"page": "Federalist Party", "response": ["Intellectually, Federalists were profoundly devoted to liberty.

As Samuel Eliot Morison explained, they believed that liberty is inseparable from union, that men are essentially unequal, that vox populi [voice of the people] is seldom if ever vox Dei [the voice of God], and that sinister outside influences were busy undermining American integrity.Samuel Eliot Morison, Harrison Gray Otis, 1765\u20131848: the urbane Federalist (2nd ed. 1969) pp. x\u2013xi Historian Patrick Allitt concludes that Federalists promoted many conservative positions, including the rule of law under the Constitution, republican government, peaceful change through elections, judicial supremacy, stable national finances, credible and active diplomacy, and protection of wealth.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives (2009) p. 26", "John C. Calhoun of South Carolina (1782-1850), at various times a Jeffersonian Republican, a Whig and a Democrat, was always an independent thinker. He moved from a strong nationalist position in the 1810s and 1820s, to a states' rights position emphasizing the rights of minorities (by which he meant white South), and rejecting a powerful central government. Jefferson and Madison in 1798 had developed a theory of nullification that would enable states to reject unconstitutional federal actions. Calhoun picked up the idea and further developed it as a defense against federal attacks on slavery.  His ideas were enormously influential among southern politicians and intellectuals in the decade after his death in 1850; his ideas were often used to promote secession in 1860 as a legal, constitutional escape valve for the South.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History (2009) pp 32-36.   Brian Farmer says, \"Perhaps no figure better exemplifies the attitudes of Southern conservatism in the antebellum period than John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.\" His ideas were revived by hard-core Southern conservatives in the 20th century.  According to Peter Viereck, \"this more extreme, very regional Calhoun conservatism still dominates much of the American South in the 1970s.\"", "After the Civil War, \"conservative\" came to mean those who supported the steady integration of blacks into American society, but opposed the Radical Republicans who wanted to impose punitive measures against ex-Confederates.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities, p. 67 Conservative Southerners thought that the radical conservatism by Northern reformers to empower the freed slaves would cause upheaval if done too quickly. They often accused northern Carpetbaggers who tried to help freed slaves of corruption. Conservatives opposed the race-based politics in the American South, but given the dominance of the Democratic party, had to settle on incrementalism. Supremacist Democrats differed from conservatives in their strong support for white supremacy, and insistence on a second-class powerless status for blacks, regardless of the Constitution.Dewey W. Grantham, The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History (1992) Southern conservatives in the 1950s added anti-communism to their agenda, believing that the ideology was poisoning the civil rights movement and the push for integration.Jeff Woods, Black struggle, red scare: segregation and anti-communism in the South LSU Press, 2004.", "Despite the popular perception that conservatism is limited to Republicans, during the era of segregation before 1965 some Southern Democrats were also conservative, opposing the segregationists in their party. Southern Democrats were a key part of a Conservative Coalition that largely blocked New Deal labor legislation in Congress from 1937 to 1963, though they tended to be liberal and vote with the rest of the Democratic Party on other economic issues. Southern Democrats fended off the more conservative Republican Party (GOP) by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the Republican Party nationally was committed to integration. That argument collapsed when Congress banned segregation in 1964. This provided an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to conservative Southerners on the basis that the GOP was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues, as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when the antiwar forces gained strength in the Democratic party. Southern conservatives moved from the Democratic Party to the GOP at the presidential level in the 1960s, and at the state and local level after 1990.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History, p. \"before the 1950s there was no such thing as a conservative movement in the United States.\", Yale University Press, 2009, Kirk, Russell.
