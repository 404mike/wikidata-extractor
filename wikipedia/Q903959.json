His most famous works were An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry (five volumes) and A History of Chemistry (four volumes), for which he received the Dexter Award and the George Sarton Medal.\nPartington was a fellow and council member of the Chemical Society of London as well as the first president of the \nSociety for History of Alchemy and Early Chemistry when it was founded in 1937. The society founded the Partington Prize in his memory in 1975. He was President of the British Society for the History of Science from 1949 to 1951.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Enthalpy", "response": ["The term expresses the obsolete concept of heat content,Howard (2002) quotes J.

Boyle, in this book, became the first to argue that experiment should form the basis of all theory, a common practice in chemistry today. He also expounded on a rudimentary atomic theory and the existence of chemical elements beyond the classic earth, fire, air, and water.\"From the mazy and incoherent alchemical and iatrochemical doctrines, the former based on false conceptions of matter, the latter on erroneous views of life processes and physiology, a new science arose \u2013 the study of the composition of substances. The formulation of this definition of chemistry was due to Robert Boyle. In his Sceptical Chemist (1662) he freely criticized the prevailing scientific views and methods, with the object of showing that true knowledge could only be gained by the logical application of the principles of experiment and deduction.\"  He is seen as the father of chemistry,Famous Chemists, Sir William A.
