Under the management of former Burnley player Brian Miller, they returned to the second tier as champions in 1981\u201382. However, this return was short-lived and lasted only one year. Managerial changes continued to be made in a search for success; Miller was replaced by Frank Casper in early 1983, he by John Bond before the 1983\u201384 season and Bond himself by John Benson a season later.Simpson (2007), pp. 550\u2013554 Bond was the first manager since Frank Hill (1948\u20131954) without a previous playing career at the club. He was criticised by the fans for signing expensive players increasing Burnley's debt, and for selling the young talents Lee Dixon, Brian Laws and Trevor Steven.Quelch (2017), pp. 24\u201339 Benson was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time at the end of the 1984\u201385 season. The team avoided relegation to the Football Conference, the highest level of non-League football, on the last day in 1986\u201387, after they won against Orient and their rivals drew or lost. The board had reportedly attempted to purchase almost bankrupt Welsh club Cardiff City and relocate it to Turf Moor, if Burnley were relegated, in what would have been the Football League's first franchise operation.Quelch (2017), p. 62"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Frank Hill"]}, {"page": "Allan Nevins", "response": ["Upon returning to Columbia, Nevins began working on a multi-volume series on the American Civil War.

In 1948 Nevins created the first oral history program to operate on an institutionalized basis in the U.S., which continues as Columbia University's Center for Oral History. In addition to publishing four more volumes of the Civil War series, Nevins reworked the Rockefeller biography to cast a more favorable light upon the magnate. In 1954 with Frank Hill, Nevins published the first of a three-volume biography of Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company, Ford: The Times, the Man, and the Company."]}, {"page": "Meanings of minor planet names: 31001\u201332000", "response": ["| 31098 Frankhill ||  || Frank Hill, American astronomer and heliosismologist || "]}, {"page": "Jack Crayston", "response": ["Despite breaking both his wrist and leg in 1933\u201334, Crayston was signed by First Division champions Arsenal in 1934 as a replacement for Charlie Jones.
