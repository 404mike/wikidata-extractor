In the older system prior to the end of the 18th century, economic transactions were based on mutual obligation. Horwitz said that when national commodities markets began to develop in England in the second half of the 18th century, \"the price of grain was no longer local, but regional; this [presupposed for the first time] the general use of money and a wide marketability of goods.\" Horwitz wrote that there was a radical difference between 18th century laws in Britain and modern contract law the old theory of title of contract \"outlived its usefulness\". This happened around the same time as organized markets were emerging and the economic system was being transformed. Horwitz criticized late 18th century writers of contract law, such as John Joseph Powell, author of the 1790 \"Essay upon the law of contracts and agreements\", for denouncing the older systems for undermining the \"rule of law\". Horwitz said the older systems in the 18th century courts were better ways of writing contract laws, as they were more \"equitable conceptions of substantive justice\"."]}, {"page": "John Powell", "response": ["* John Joseph Powell (1816\u20131891), British Member of Parliament for Gloucester, 1862\u20131865"]}, {"page": "Thomas Robinson (Gloucester MP)", "response": ["In 1873 Robinson stood in a by-election Gloucester after out manoeuvering former Liberal member John Joseph Powell for the candidature, but was defeated. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester in 1880 after the Liberals had established a party caucus chosen by ward meetings, resulting in improved organisation. However bribery and corruption were on a major scale in Gloucester and Robinson was unseated in the same year. His willingness to stand down and the unwillingness of the Conservatives to take matters further led to suspicions of collusion between the parties and a Royal Commission was set up to examine electoral practices. The Royal Commission concluded that Gloucester was among the most corrupt of the seven towns investigated and that bribery was endemic in all elections in the city. The Commission concluded that half of the electorate had taken bribes in 1880, and blamed local politicians for most of the corruption. Notwithstanding this, and the virtual halving of the electorate eligible to vote, Robinson was reelected for Gloucester in 1885 when representation had been reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.
