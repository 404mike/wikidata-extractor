However, by January 1964, little work had been done on the serial, and Nation was busy writing The Keys of Marinus. Script editor David Whitaker was later assigned to the episode, possibly about the Spanish Armada, with Gerald Blake to direct; however, this was soon scrapped, and Whitaker asked Dennis Spooner, a friend of Nation, to write an episode instead. Although Spooner was originally interested in writing a science fiction story, Whitaker was seeking a historical serial after John Lucarotti's Marco Polo and The Aztecs. Spooner was given four possible subjects, eventually deciding to focus on the French Revolution, a setting first suggested by actor William Russell. Spooner was officially commissioned by Whitaker on 2 April 1964, following Spooner's submission of a 23-page breakdown for the serial. Hungarian director Henric Hirsch was chosen to direct the serial after producer Verity Lambert saw his work on First Night, while Stanley Myers composed the serial's incidental music. Myers created 28 minutes of music for the serial, taking cues from French music such as the national anthem \"La Marseillaise\"."]}, {"page": "Super Gran", "response": ["|rowspan=\"1\"|\"Christmas Supergran: The World's Worst Circus\" ||24 December 1986 || Gerald Blake ||1", "|rowspan=\"1\"|\"Supergran and the Yankee Doodle's Boodle\" || 29 March 1987 ||Gerald Blake ||4", "|rowspan=\"1\"|\"Supergran and the State Visit\" || 12 April 1987 ||Gerald Blake ||6"]}, {"page": "David Macmillan", "response": ["* Dr. Finlay's Casebook (1962) (TV Series) (ten episodes)...playing \"PC Dickie\" (eighteen episodes) (BBC - Campbell Logan, Gerald Blake, Cedric Messina and Julia Smith)"]}, {"page": "Christopher Guard", "response": ["| Gerald Blake"]}, {"page": "List of The Omega Factor episodes", "response": ["| Gerald Blake"]}, {"page": "History of Blake's 7", "response": ["Vere Lorrimer, the only returning director, directed four episodes in Series Three.

Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir with whom he had worked before.. Weir's script, a six-part story, was planned as the final story of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat-people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. Read and director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that the story would be impossible to shoot on Doctor Who's budget and the story was abandoned mid-August 1977.. With only two weeks to spare before filming, Read and Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's story at a fan convention years later, Williams could not recall its title and made up the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the story became widely known in fan circles."]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders crew members", "response": ["*Gerald Blake (1989)"]}, {"page": "List of Out of the Unknown episodes", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|302||\u201cLiar!\u201d||Isaac Asimov||David Campton||Gerald Blake||align=\"center\"|14 January 1969||align=\"center\"|No", "|align=\"center\"|405||\u201cThe Sons and Daughters of Tomorrow\u201d||Edward Boyd||n/a||Gerald Blake||align=\"center\"|19 May 1971||align=\"center\"|No"]}, {"page": "Quiller (TV series)", "response": ["| Gerald Blake", "| Gerald Blake"]}, {"page": "Gerald Blake", "response": ["Gerald Blake may refer to:", "* Gerald Blake (academic), British academic", "* Gerald Blake (cricketer) (born 1944), South African cricketer", "* Gerald Blake (director) (1928\u20131991), British television director"]}]}}
