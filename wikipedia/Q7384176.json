He made his Football League debut in 2011 following AFC Wimbledon's promotion to League Two, before loan spells at Fleetwood Town and Cambridge United. Following his release by Wimbledon in 2012, he signed for Conference Premier side Macclesfield Town. He joined League Two side Newport County one year later, where he made 63 league appearances before joining League One club Gillingham. He was released after two seasons and 71 league appearances, joining Colchester United in League Two.

He also brought in goalkeeper Rene Gilmartin and midfielder Ryan Jackson. He made a series of loan signings to bolster the squad, which included the arrivals of Ryan Inniss, Brandon Comley, Kyel Reid and Brandon Hanlan. Colchester got off to a poor start, but improved and collected ten points from five games to earn McGreal another Manager of the Month nomination in October. The young side's good form continued into December, where they picked up 11 points from a possible 15 to earn him yet another Manager of the Month nomination. However they struggled in the second half of the campaign, despite holding on to top-scorer Sammie Szmodics in the January transfer window, and ended the season in 13th-place. McGreal released four senior players and seven from the U-23 team. Sam Walker and Sean Murray also departed after failing to agree new deals.", "He signed a number of young players to replace those that had departed: Kwame Poku, Luke Gambin, Omar Sowunmi, Jevani Brown, Cohen Bramall and Callum Harriott. More senior players Paris Cowan-Hall and Dean Gerken were also signed, whilst Theo Robinson joined on a season-long loan from Southend United. Having made an indifferent start to the 2019\u201320 League Two season, Colchester entered the play-offs for the first time with a 3\u20131 win at Leyton Orient on Boxing day. The team reached the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup, eliminating both Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur on penalties after holding both Premier League teams to 0\u20130 draws. In the quarter-finals they were beaten 3\u20130 by Manchester United at Old Trafford. The season ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England and the table was decided on points per game with Colchester in the play-offs in sixth-place. However the club announced that 16 players would be released at their end of their contracts, with chairman Robbie Cowling admitting that he \"would have been determined to re-sign\" Brandon Comley, Ryan Jackson, Frank Nouble and Luke Prosser in normal circumstances. Colchester lost out to Exeter City after extra-time in the play-off semi-finals and McGreal was subsequently dismissed by the club on 14 July 2020 as Cowling felt that \"significant changes are required that will be best served with a new head coach\". McGreal said he was \"deeply saddened\" with the decision to end his 11-year association with the club and that \"the memories of this season will live with me forever\"."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 AFC Wimbledon season", "response": ["| align=\"center\" |  Ryan Jackson", "| align=\"center\" |  Ryan Jackson", "| align=\"center\" |  Ryan Jackson"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": [" The game ended 2\u20132, with AFC Wimbledon winning the tie 4\u20133 on penalties.
