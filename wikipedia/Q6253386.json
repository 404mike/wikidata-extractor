He possessed an excellent arm in the deep, but seldom troubled the opposition with a bat in his hand.  He took 734 wickets for Middlesex in 242 matches at just 22.39 each, carrying their attack in the late 1960s, having only established himself in the first team in 1963 at the age of 25, after playing club cricket with Wembley Cricket Club.
