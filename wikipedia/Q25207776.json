As part of the deal, Cardiff agreed to a clause that would see the club receive a further \u00a3250 if both Hillier and Jennings played in twenty league matches for Middlesbrough. When both players reached the tally in May 1933, Cardiff issued a request for the money to be paid but received a cheque for just \u00a350. When Cardiff queried the payment, Middlesbrough produced the agreement paper which included only a bonus of \u00a350, an error that was later revealed to have been made by former Cardiff manager Fred Stewart who had mistakenly written the wrong figure.

John Jennings made more appearances than any other player as he was ever present, playing in all 42 league matches and 5 cup fixtures. Prior to this season, Jennings had normally been considered a reserve player, but the long-term injuries to Nelson and Watson led to him becoming a regular.

With their hopes of promotion fading, the board sanctioned further sales to raise funds with a triple transfer involving John Jennings, Joe Hillier and Warren all moving to Middlesbrough for a combined fee of \u00a38,000. Stewart was afforded a small portion of the money and signed Ralph Williams from non-League side Colwyn Bay for \u00a3800.
