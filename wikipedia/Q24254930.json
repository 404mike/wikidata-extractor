He joined the army and was Cornet in the 1st Dragoons in 1764.In the autumn of 1767, Clive was going to stand for Leominster at the next general election, but probably because his brother Lord Clive had obtained complete control of Bishops Castle he was returned there unopposed as Member of Parliament.

He became a lieutenant in 1771 and retired from the army in 1776.Clive was returned again as MP for Bishops Castle by his nephew Edward, Lord Clive in a by-election on 31 March 1779 .
