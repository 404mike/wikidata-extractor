He made his debut against Leeds United on 5 May 1966 (a match which coincidentally saw Arsenal's lowest-ever attendance at Highbury, of just 4,554) but could not break into the first team and left Arsenal in September 1967 with just 12 appearances to his name. He moved to Huddersfield Town, where he spent four seasons and won the Second Division title, and then another five seasons at Hull City where he was club captain. He then moved to Halifax Town and spent time on loan in the US and later played in Australia before returning to England where he finished his career at Frickley Athletic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1971\u201372 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Jimmy McGill||||MF||10 (1)||0||0||0||1||0||11 (1)||0"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Jimmy McGill||||MF||41||1||5||0||2||0||48||1"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["Huddersfield Town's 1969\u201370 campaign saw Town crowned as champions of Division 2.
