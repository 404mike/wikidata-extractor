Oldham started the match quickly when Adam Virgo brought down Chris Taylor in the penalty box, allowing Andy Liddell to convert a spot-kick for a 1\u20130 Latics advantage in the 9th minute. However, Steven Thomson slid a ball past the Oldham defence to Glenn Murray who fired a shot into the roof of the net, putting the Seagulls back level at 1\u20131. Adam Virgo, who received a yellow card for his tackle of Taylor, received a second in the 48th minute and was sent off. Despite having only ten men, the Brighton defence frustrated the Latics, holding on for a 1\u20131 draw. A week later, the Latics traveled to face Peterborough United at London Road Stadium. This game was again off to a quick start, however, it was the opposition who struck first. A shot from Aaron McLean in the 12th minute deflected off Latics defender Stefan Stam, giving Peterborough a 1\u20130 lead. Eight minutes before the halftime break, McLean extended the lead with another goal with a rebound from a spot-kick, shortly after having another spot-kick saved by Oldham goalkeeper Greg Fleming. After several comebacks throughout the season, Oldham again showed their intentions when Lee Hughes poked the ball into the opposition's net for a 2\u20131 halftime lead for Peterborough. Just before the hour mark, Hughes again scored when he put a loose ball into the net. With several more chances for both sides, the game ended with a 2\u20132 draw. After two consecutive draws, Oldham was set to face Leyton Orient. Despite early efforts from Danny Whitaker and Darren Byfield, Oldham was unable to net an early goal. A Leyton Orient goal looked possible when Adam Chambers got a rebound twelve yards out, but the midfielder sent the ball high over the net. After Byfield was pulled down in the penalty area by Tamika Mkandawire, Andy Liddell struck his 8th goal of the season via a penalty kick for a 1\u20130 halftime advantage. Near the midway point of the second half, Greg Fleming gave Orient a chance to get back on level terms when he fouled Ryan Jarvis in the box. Fleming saved the penalty, but Jason Demetriou scored from a rebound, earning Leyton Orient a 1\u20131 draw\u2014Oldham's third consecutive. Oldham was away to face Crewe Alexandra under new manager Gudjon Thordarson on Boxing Day. Despite struggling with an illness just days before the match, Darren Byfield was named to the starting lineup. Just before the hour mark in the match, Byfield scored his first for the club from a through back from Kelvin Lomax. The win was secured when Lee Hughes curled a ball past Stuart Tomlinson, before Hughes grabbed another five minutes before the final whistle for a 3\u20130 win. Two days after the Boxing Day victory, Oldham faced off against Carlisle United for the final match of 2008. Terrific play from Carlisle goalkeeper Tim Krul kept Oldham out of goal, despite giving the Latics nineteen corners. Neither side had an attacking threat until 17 minutes in when a Reuben Hazell header forced Krul into a saved shot. With nineteen total shots for the Latics, manager John Sheridan was surprised when the game ended in a scoreless draw."]}, {"page": "Jarvis (name)", "response": ["* Ryan Jarvis, English footballer"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Norwich City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ryan Jarvis"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Ryan Jarvis", "|Ryan Jarvis"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Leyton Orient F.C. season", "response": ["| Ryan Jarvis", "|align=\"left\"|14||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ryan Jarvis", "|Ryan Jarvis"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 || ST || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Ryan Jarvis", "| Ryan Jarvis"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Norwich City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ryan Jarvis"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["With a daunting eight fixtures scheduled for the month, Martin Ling endeavoured to strengthen the squad with the signing of Ryan Jarvis on loan from League One Walsall.  Jarvis had previously played under Ling at Leyton Orient but had recently failed to cement a regular place in the Saddlers' first team and so was allowed to the join the Gulls until the end of the season. Jarvis made his Torquay debut when he came on as a sub for the injured Danny Stevens in the month's first fixture, a tricky tie away to Crawley Town.  Also making his debut for the Gulls was Angus MacDonald who came in for the suspended Brian Saah.  The young defender gave an assured performance in his first ever League appearance to help Torquay gain a 1\u20130 victory over their promotion-chasing rivals.  It was a particularly satisfying result for the Torquay fans after August's humiliating 3\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor and the previous season's FA Cup exit.", "Torquay were back on the road again for their next three fixtures, the first of which was a midweek trip up to Rotherham's Don Valley Stadium. Again, Lee Mansell was the man on the score sheet in another 1\u20130 victory for the Gulls.  If the Rotherham match was a demonstration of Torquay's dogged defending, their next match provided a display of the team's attacking prowess with a comfortable 4\u20131 victory over Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium.  It was to be manager Paul Peschisolido's last game in charge of the Brewers as he was sacked shortly afterwards. Coincidentally, Torquay's previous opponents Rotherham also parted company with their manager Andy Scott just two days later. Although it's unlikely that Swindon boss Paolo Di Canio would have been fearing for his own position when the Gulls arrived at the County Ground, he would certainly have been aware of the Torquay threat with the side now second in the table just behind Di Canio's men.  However, it was to prove a disappointing evening for the Gulls who were defeated 2\u20130 by the League leaders.  Fears that Torquay's bubble may finally have burst began to emerge after Port Vale went in 1\u20130 up at half time in their match at Plainmoor.  Yet again however, Martin Ling's men proved they had the spirit for the fight and came back to win the match 2\u20131 in the second half, the winner being Ryan Jarvis's first goal for the club.
