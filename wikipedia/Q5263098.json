His main oeuvre was blocked-grid and \"specialty\" puzzles. Even though he only provided conventional blocked puzzles once a week for the Observer Everyman series for about two years his strong views on clueing, expressed in his 1966 book, have been a source of debate in the cryptic crossword world ever since.", "link_mentions": {}}}
