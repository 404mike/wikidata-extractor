The duo's first season in charge of Derby saw the club finish one place lower, 18th, than the previous campaign but it saw the recruitment of numerous players, such Roy McFarland, John O'Hare and Alan Hinton, who between them made 1,154 appearances for the club and would go on to form the spine of the club's most successful ever side. Of the inherited squad, eleven players departed and only four were retained: Kevin Hector, Alan Durban, Ron Webster and Colin Boulton. Clough also fired the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a defeat. The season was notable for a run to the League Cup semi finals, the club's first ever notable run in the competition, where they lost 4\u20132 on aggregate to eventual winners Leeds United. The campaign also saw Reg Matthews set the club record of 246 appearances by a goalkeeper, as he surpassed Harry Maskrey's previous record of 222."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Harry Maskrey||||1909\u20131911||41||0||"]}, {"page": "Dick Healey (footballer)", "response": ["Healey began his football career with Darlington while still a schoolboy, and was playing for Bishop Auckland as they won the Northern League title in the 1908\u201309 season. His play attracted attention. In February 1910, he was selected for an amateur international trial, and in March, he appeared for Sunderland's North-Eastern League team, creating two goals and scoring the last in a 6\u20130 defeat of Darlington. He made his Football League debut in April, in a 2\u20130 defeat away to Manchester United in the First Division. The Sunderland Daily Echo commented that he and fellow inside forward George Holley \"perhaps did not make the most of their opportunities, for when in possession in the shooting zone they failed to shoot with sufficient power.\" He kept his place for the last home match of the season, against Bradford City, \"proved a keen worker\", according to the Echo correspondent, and scored the first two goals in a 3\u20130 win. The first resulted from Bradford's goalkeeper Harry Maskrey losing the ball when attempting a clearance; he then \"seized Healey, but the latter struggled free and jumping over Maskrey he put the ball in the net\". The second was a header from a corner. He missed Sunderland's last match of the season to play for Bishop Auckland in a 2\u20131 win against Scarborough that secured them the Northern League title. Sunderland retained Healey's Football League registration for each season up to 1913\u201314, but he played only once more for the first team, at Aston Villa in October 1911. and "]}, {"page": "Maskrey", "response": ["*Harry Maskrey (1880\u20131927), English footballer", "*Harry Maskrey (baseball) (1861\u20131930), American baseball player"]}]}}
