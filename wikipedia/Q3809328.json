Anderson had a box into which items were inserted. The medium would then describe the contents inside. In Robert-Houdin's version, he walked into the audience and touched items that the audience held up, and his blindfolded assistant, played by his son, described each one in detail. It caused a sensation and brought the throng to see his shows.", "Robert-Houdin's inventions were pirated by his trusted mechanic Le Grand, who was arrested for making and selling duplicate illusions. Many of those illusions fell into the hands of his competitors, such as John Henry Anderson, Robin, Robert Heller, and Compars Herrmann. It is not known whether Herrmann or the others bought the illusions directly from LeGrand or from another source, but they willingly performed the illusions after knowing that they were invented by Robert-Houdin."]}, {"page": "John Anderson", "response": ["* John Henry Anderson (1814\u20131874), Scottish magician"]}, {"page": "List of Aberdonians", "response": ["*John Henry Anderson (1814\u20131874), magician"]}, {"page": "Bullet catch", "response": ["Around 1840, Scottish magician John Henry Anderson began demonstrating the gun trick in theatres throughout Britain. Anderson, or The Great Wizard of the North as he was called, performed for P.T.
