He was re-elected at the 1923 election, but at the 1924 general election he lost his seat by 701 votes to the Conservative candidate Christopher Brooke. He was re-elected at the 1929 general election, but was defeated again at the 1931 general election.\nHe returned to the House of Commons at an uncontested by-election in August 1933, in the neighbouring Normanton constituency, following the death of the Labour MP Frederick Hall. He held the seat until he resigned his seat in 1946 to take up the post of Labour Director of the North-Eastern Divisional Coal Board. At the resulting 1947 Normanton by-election, the seat was held for Labour by George Sylvester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Smith", "response": ["Tom Smith may refer to:", "*Tom Smith (horse trainer) (1878\u20131957), American thoroughbred racehorse trainer of Seabiscuit", "*Tom Smith (second baseman) (1851\u20131889), Major League player", "*Tom Smith (pitcher) (1871\u20131929), Major League player", "*Tom Smith (baseball coach), American college baseball coach", "*Tom Smith (Australian footballer) (1873\u20131928), Australian rules footballer", "*Tom Smith (American football) (born 1949), American football player", "*Tom Smith (basketball) (born 1944), American college basketball coach", "*Tom Smith (cricketer, born 1906) (1906\u20131995), English cricketer for Essex", "*Tom Smith (cricketer, born 1985), English cricketer who currently plays for Lancashire", "*Tom Smith (cricketer, born 1987), English cricketer who currently plays for Gloucestershire", "*Tom Smith (cricketer, born 1996), English cricketer", "*Tom Smith (fencer), Irish Olympic fencer", "*Tom Smith (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131937), scorer for Tottenham Hotspur in the 1901 FA Cup Final replay", "*Tom Smith (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u2013?), English footballer with Preston North End, Southampton and Queens Park Rangers", "*Tom Smith (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131934), English footballer with Leicester City, Manchester United and Northampton Town", "*Tom Smith (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u20131998), Scottish footballer with Kilmarnock, Preston North End and Scotland, also managed Kilmarnock", "*Tom Smith (footballer, born 1910), English footballer, played for Higham Utd, Nelson, Norden, Rochdale, Luton Town and Burnley", "*Tom Smith (footballer, born 1973), Scottish footballer with Partick Thistle, Ayr United, Clydebank and Hibernian", "*Tom Smith (footballer, born 1998), English footballer with Swindon Town", "*Tom Smith (rugby union, born 1883) (1883\u20131960), English rugby union player", "*Tom Smith (rugby union, born 1893) (c. 1893 \u2013 c. 1965), Australian rugby union player", "*Tom Smith (rugby union, born 1971), Scottish rugby union player", "*Tom Smith (rugby union, born 1985), Welsh rugby union player", "*Tom Smith (filker), American musician", "*Tom Smith (make-up artist) (1920\u20132009), British make-up artist", "*Tom Smith (musician) (born 1981), lead singer of British rock band Editors", "*Tom Smith (Christian musician) (born 1988), member of Soul Survivor", "*Tom Smith (playwright) (born 1969), American playwright and theater director", "*Tom Smith (author), American business executive and author", "*Tom Smith (artist), American-born abstract artist", "*Tom Smith (confectioner) (1823\u20131869), confectioner and inventor of the Christmas cracker", "*Tom Smith (British politician) (1886\u20131953), British politician", "*Tom Smith (Australian politician) (1890\u20131975), New South Wales politician", "*Tom Smith (Queensland politician), Australian politician", "*Tom Smith (Arizona politician) (born 1927), Arizona politician", "*Tom Smith (Pennsylvania politician) (1947\u20132015), American businessman and political candidate", "*Tom Smith (West Virginia politician), American highway engineer", "*Tom Smith (trade unionist) (1900s\u20131970), British trade union leader", "* Tom Smith (engineer) (1927\u20132012), Grimsby-born British aerospace engineer, led the BAC MUSTARD late 1960s project"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Tom Smith"]}, {"page": "Churchill caretaker ministry", "response": ["| succeeded Tom Smith; Hudson was previously a backbench MP"]}, {"page": "Tom Smith (Labour politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Smith (British politician)"]}, {"page": "1946 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Tom Smith, MP, Member of Parliament for Pontefract, 1922\u20131924, 1929\u20131931 and for Normanton since 1933 Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Fuel and Power, 1942\u20131945.
