After retiring as a player, he later served Liverpool as assistant manager and, during the 2001\u201302 season, acted as caretaker for 6 months while manager G\u00e9rard Houllier was ill.

The first international match hosted at Anfield was between England and Ireland, in 1889. England won the match 6\u20131. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England's international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the Welsh national team in the later part of that century.Kelly (1988). p. 118.

He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3\u20132 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich, but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4\u20131, but was dropped for the following league match. Though Fowler had been on a contract extension from 1999 (unlike Steve McManaman \u2013 who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year), Fowler was linked to Lazio, Arsenal and Leeds United, and Liverpool's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with McManaman (regarded as a huge financial loss) would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration. This meant that coupled with Fowler's relationship with Houllier, speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans. His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland, in which he was substituted at half-time.Fowler, p. 317."]}, {"page": "Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)", "response": ["Though naturally a central midfield player, Murphy often played as a wide midfielder due to the fierce competition for places, most notably from Steven Gerrard and Dietmar Hamann. Murphy's career at Liverpool included a unique cup treble in 2001 (where Liverpool won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup), a Premier League second-place finish in 2002 and a second League Cup in 2003. During the 2001\u201302 season, when he established himself as a key member of the side, Liverpool's assistant manager Phil Thompson praised Murphy, citing his versatility and describing him as 'probably the most tactically aware player that we have.' Although the 2002\u201303 season was overall a disappointing one for Liverpool, with the club slumping to fifth in the table after a lengthy winless run in mid-winter, Murphy had a fine individual campaign which saw him score 12 goals and be voted the supporters' player of the season.

This was the start of several long-running feuds between the two robust characters, and over the coming years, they would confront each other in various circumstances.", "Souness also fell out with former Liverpool teammates Tommy Smith and Phil Thompson during his time in charge at Anfield. In his autobiography, Souness said that Thompson, the reserve team manager, was overheard angrily criticising his tactics and purchases behind his back. This was overheard by Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd and relayed to Walter Smith, who was so alarmed by Thompson's behaviour that he drove from Scotland to Liverpool to tell Souness what had been said. Souness dismissed Thompson as a result and the two have remained bitter towards each other since, with Thompson claiming in his own book he would never speak to Souness again as a result."]}, {"page": "Aintree", "response": ["*Phil Thompson, former Liverpool captain and now Sky Sports pundit, lived on Bull Bridge Lane."]}, {"page": "Communist Workers' Party (United States)", "response": ["* The Current Revolutionary Situation: Our Tasks.

Completing a bad end to 1987, his licence at the Melton Constable was revoked. His prescribed L-DOPA medication also became less effective and he became increasingly isolated. His condition improved when he began injections of apomorphine. He was reliant on the Professional Footballers' Association to pay his medical expenses, and his divorce as well as business and tax problems wiped out his savings. A testimonial game was held between Arsenal and Liverpool in April 1991. A charity appeal was also set up to help pay his living costs.
