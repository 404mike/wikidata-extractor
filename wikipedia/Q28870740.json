He was awarded his county cap in 1962, and had a benefit season in 1969.Mike Willett was a hard-hitting batsman who played for Surrey for several years before establishing himself in the team: between his first-class debut in 1955 and the end of the 1960 season he played only 25 matches, reaching 50 once. He made a century in his first match in 1961 and finished the season with 1593 runs at an average of 30.63.

His innings included 12 sixes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Collins", "response": ["He joined Cheshire in 1963, making his debut for the county against Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship. He played Minor counties cricket intermittently for Cheshire until 1973, making a total of 49 appearances. He had left Lancashire a season before List A cricket was introduced, a format which would have suited his hard hitting batting style. He made his List A debut for Cheshire against Surrey in the 1st round of the 1964 Gillette Cup at the Ellerman Lines Cricket Ground in Hoylake. Collins top scored in Cheshire's innings with 58, before being dismissed by Michael Willett. Surrey won the match by 62 runs. He made a second List A appearance in the 1966 Gillette Cup against his former county at the Macclesfield Cricket Club Ground, scoring a single run before he was dismissed by Peter Lever, with Lancashire winning by 42 runs."]}, {"page": "Michael Willett", "response": ["Michael Willett may refer to:", "* Michael Willett (cricketer) (1933\u20132002), English cricketer"]}]}}
