He played as a midfielder.Coughlin began his professional career with Manchester City in 1977, but after failing to break into the first team at Maine Road, he joined Blackburn Rovers the following year. At Ewood Park, he made 24 league appearances in two years.\nIn 1980, Coughlin moved north to join Carlisle United. He went on to make 130 league appearances for the Cumbrians, scoring thirteen goals.\nFour years later, in 1984, Coughlin moved to England's south coast to sign for Plymouth Argyle. There, he broke the 130-league-game mark again, scoring eighteen goals in the process.\nIn 1987, he returned to the north-west to join Sam Ellis's Blackpool. He made his debut for the Seasiders on 12 December, in a 1\u20131 draw at Chesterfield in the league. He scored his first goal for the club three games later, in another 1\u20131 draw, this time at Notts County. He went on to make 24 appearances and score two goals in total during the 1987\u201388 league campaign.\nThe following season, 1988\u201389, Coughlin spent the majority of his games as strike partner to new signing Andy Garner. In 42 league appearances, he scored five goals, three of which were from the penalty spot. He also scored in Blackpool's League Cup campaign, in a 2\u20130 second round, first leg victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Bloomfield Road on 27 September 1988.\nIn 1989\u201390, under new manager Jimmy Mullen, Coughlin returned to his favoured midfield role. He made 34 league appearances and scored one goal as Blackpool finished second-bottom and were relegated to Division Four. Coughlin left the seaside early the following season after a loan spell at Shrewsbury Town.\nCoughlin joined his hometown club, Swansea City, for the 1990\u201391 season, and went on to make 101 league appearances for the Welshmen, before leaving for Exeter City in 1993, in part-exchange for John Hodge.\nAfter a two-year spell with Exeter, Coughlin brought his career to a close with Torquay United in 1996. He made almost 600 appearances and scored 41 goals in his 19-year Football League career.\nIn August 2016, Coughlin died at Cumberland Infirmary after suffering a medical event while behind the wheel of his car and being involved in a crash in Carlisle. A wreath was laid for him at Bloomfield Road before the opening 2016\u201317 Football League Two fixture between Blackpool and Exeter City, both of whom he had played for in his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["| align=\"left\"| Russell Coughlin"]}, {"page": "1960 in Wales", "response": ["*15 February \u2013 Russell Coughlin, footballer (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "Coughlin", "response": ["*Russell Coughlin (born 1960), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["A squad photograph taken prior to the club's FA Cup tie with Q.P.R. appeared in Match magazine.

Veteran midfielder Alan Birchenall immediately gave him nickname \"Baz\", in reference to the late actor Basil Rathbone. Having been struggling near the foot of the table at the Second Division time of his arrival, Blackburn were relegated to the Third Division at the end of the 1978\u201379 season. He enjoyed his time at Ewood Park however, and was instrumental in the loan being made permanent as he begged Jim Smith to sanction a transfer, which Smith did after accepting Rovers manager John Pickering's offer of \u00a340,000. Rathbone signed a three-year contract and received a \u00a32,000 signing-on fee. However his lack of confidence was then replaced with a lack of discipline, as he admitted that he and teammate Russell Coughlin \"slow and surely\u00a0... drank and ate ourselves out of the game\". New manager Howard Kendall gave him a three-month suspension in punishment for Rathbone's declining physical condition. During his suspension he met his future wife, who helped him to take a more professional approach to his drinking and eating habits."]}, {"page": "List of footballers in England by number of league appearances", "response": ["!scope=row data-sort-value=\"Coughlin, Russell\"|Russell Coughlin"]}, {"page": "1991 Welsh Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||9|| Russell Coughlin"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*3 August \u2013 Russell Coughlin, 56, footballer (Carlisle United, Plymouth Argyle, Swansea City)."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 in English football", "response": ["* 3 August 2016: Russell Coughlin, 56, Blackburn Rovers, Carlisle United, Plymouth Argyle, Blackpool, Swansea City, Exeter City and Torquay United midfielder.Ex-player Russell Coughlin dies aged 56 "]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2016", "response": ["*Russell Coughlin, 56, Welsh footballer (Carlisle, Plymouth, Swansea), traffic collision.Ex-player Russell Coughlin dies aged 56"]}]}}
