He was a leader in the provision of humanitarian care for mental hospital patients.\nBlumer was born in Sunderland, England.  His father was a physician as were his two brothers.  His early education in England was followed by schooling in Germany and France.  In 1874, he entered the medical school at the University of Edinburgh and remained for one year before he emigrated to the United States.  He completed his medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and graduated in 1879.  After a residency of one year at Lankenau Hospital in Philadelphia, he obtained a post of assistant physician at the New York State Lunatic Asylum (also known as the New York State Inebriate Asylum) in Utica, New York, under the superintendency of John P. Gray, M.D., a prominent psychiatrist.  Gray died in 1886 and Blumer became the superintendent of Utica.\nBlumer instituted many reforms at Utica.  He abolished all forms of patient restraints, improved living conditions for patients, placed women nurses on male wards, established occupations and amusements for patients, and succeeded in officially changing the name of the institution to Utica State Hospital.\nIn 1890, the New York State legislature established a State Commission on Lunacy with the director to be responsible for the administration of the state mental hospitals.  The Commission of two lay members and a chief psychiatrist began to follow the legislature\u2019s charge but encountered opposition from the state hospital superintendents who, until then, exercised total control of their institutions.  It was an ongoing struggle between the Commission and the superintendents, and Blumer took an active role.  Blumer\u2019s struggle with the Commission included the Commission\u2019s attempt to take over the leading psychiatric publication in the United States, the American Journal of Insanity.  The journal had been established and edited by Amariah Brigham, the first superintendent at Utica and was owned by the hospital.  An earlier court ruling confirmed that the hospital owned the journal.  Blumer arranged for the American Medico-Psychological Association, now the American Psychiatric Association, to purchase the journal and publish it as the Journal of the American Psychiatric Association, which continues today.  As editor of the American Journal of Insanity, Blumer influenced the psychiatric community.  He remained an editor emeritus of the journal until he died.  In 1899, he accepted the post of Superintendent of the private Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island where he remained until his retirement in 1921.  Blumer remained in Providence after retirement and was named Superintendent Emeritus of Butler.\nBlumer was elected president of the American Psychiatric Association from 1903 to 1904.  His presidential address dealt with the politicization of state mental hospitals, eugenics, and the role of immigration relating to state hospital missions.\nWhile at Butler, Blumer participated in numerous community organizations.  He was president of the Providence Athenaeum in Rhode Island, a trustee of the Rhode Island School of Design, president of the Rhode Island Historical Society, on the Board of Visitors at Brown University, and director of the State Mental Hygiene Society.\nBlumer received honorary degrees from Brown University (L.H.D., 1905) and from Hamilton College (L.H.D. 1921).  He was named an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1921 by Brown University.\nHe died in 1940.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Maudsley", "response": ["While earlier he had argued, per B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel, that degenerate families would die out, he would begin in the 1890s to consider degeneration as a regressive force and threat to evolution and moral progress. This appears to have had a significant influence on psychiatrists such as George Alder Blumer who became at least for some time converts to eugenics.Keeping America Sane: Psychiatry and Eugenics in the United States and Canada, 1880-1940"]}, {"page": "Utica Psychiatric Center", "response": ["In the Edinburgh Medical Journal (February 1878), Dr. Lindsay and other physicians at the Murray Royal Institution at Perth recommended the Utica Crib. Lindsay stated that \"the bed was practical and safe to patients.\" However, Dr. Hammond and Dr. Mycert of the Utica State Hospital attacked the Utica Crib. Mycert stated that \"the crib is at most barbarous and unscientific because there is already a tendency to determine the blood to the brain in excited forms of insanity which is released by the horizontal position in the crib and struggles the patient.\" Mycert also compared the Utica Crib to a coffin.  Hammond stated that sometimes patients died from being in the Utica Crib. Some of these deaths occurred when attendants thought the patients were out of control when, in fact, they were having a heart attack, a stroke, or some other type of serious health problem. On January 18, 1887, with the help of George Alder Blumer, all Utica Cribs were removed from the Utica State Hospital."]}, {"page": "Blumer", "response": ["*George Alder Blumer (1857\u20131940), American psychiatrist"]}, {"page": "Alder (surname)", "response": ["* George Alder Blumer (18571940), British-born American physician, mental hospital administrator and journal editor"]}]}}
