He went on to make nine league appearances for the club before he was sold to Cardiff City in August 1964 as manager Jimmy Scoular's first signing for a fee of \u00a32,000. In his first season at the club he helped the side to win the Welsh Cup and reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners Cup, where they were knocked out by Real Zaragoza. The following season the club reached the semi-finals of the League Cup against West Ham United. Wilson was dropped after conceding five goals in the first leg, only for his replacement to also concede five in the second leg. It was during this season that Wilson helped the club to reach the semi-final of the Cup Winners Cup; the furthest Cardiff have ever been in a European competition, where they were defeated by Hamburg. Despite constant pressure from Dilwyn John and Lyn Davies he managed to hold on to the number one spot for the majority of his stay at the club."]}, {"page": "IBSF World Snooker Championship", "response": ["|  Dilwyn John"]}, {"page": "Welsh Amateur Championship (snooker)", "response": ["|  Dilwyn John"]}]}}
