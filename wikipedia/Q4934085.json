He also played football as an inside forward in the 1960s, notably with Rochdale.\nStephenson was born in  Derby. He was a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper, who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire between 1967 and 1968. He joined Hampshire for the 1969 season.\nHampshire played steadily during 1969, finishing the season in fifth place, though the team found the following season hard-going and ended 1970 with just four victories under their belt.\nStephenson continued to serve Hampshire through the inconsistent times of the mid-70s, the highlight being the team's second-ever victory in the County Championship in 1973. Stephenson remained a first-team choice through the late 1970s, and into the 1980 season, but he retired from first-class cricket after Hampshire's bottom-placed finish in that season's County Championship. Stephenson's sole first-class century came for Hampshire against Somerset in 1976. He was club captain during his penultimate season following the retirement of Richard Gilliat.\nStephenson was also a professional footballer, playing for Derby County, Shrewsbury Town and Rochdale in the 1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Stevenson (cricketer)", "response": ["George Stevenson should not be confused with Bob Stephenson, real name George Stephenson, former Derbyshire and Hampshire cricketer."]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Bob Stephenson"]}, {"page": "George Stephenson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bob Stephenson (sportsman) (George Robert Stephenson, born 1942), English cricketer, son of the above"]}, {"page": "Robert Stephenson (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Bob Stephenson (sportsman) (born 1942), English cricketer and footballer", "* Bob Stephenson (ice hockey) (born 1954), retired Canadian ice hockey right winger", "* Bob Stephenson (baseball) (1928\u20132020), American baseball player", "* Bob Stephenson (actor) (born 1967), American actor, film producer and screenwriter", "* Bob Stephenson (American football) (born 1959), American football player"]}, {"page": "Bob Stephenson (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Stephenson (sportsman)"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire cricket captains", "response": ["*  Bob Stephenson 1979"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club first-class cricket records", "response": ["|Bob Stephenson|||| 570 || 75 || 645"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Stephenson", "response": ["Stephenson's brothers were England international footballers Clem and George and he was the uncle of sportsman Bob Stephenson.
