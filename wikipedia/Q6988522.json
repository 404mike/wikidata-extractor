He is currently Professor of Physics at George Washington University in Washington D.C. where he heads up a new initiative in Complexity and Data Science which combines cross-disciplinary fundamental research with data science, with a view to resolving complex real-world problems.  \nHe is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) and is the recipient of the 2018 Burton Award from the APS.He presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures \"Arrows of time\" on BBC TV in 1999. He has more than 300 published research papers across a wide variety of research topics and has supervised the doctoral theses of more than 25 students. He is also notable for his books Financial Market Complexity published by Oxford University Press and Simply Complexity: A Clear Guide to Complexity Theory published by Oneworld Publications, and for his research on the many-body dynamics of insurgent conflict and online extremism.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Institution Christmas Lectures", "response": ["| Neil F.
