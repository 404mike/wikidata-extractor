Smart, whose brother Jack was also a first-class cricketer and a Test match umpire, was considered by Wisden to be one of the \"most explosive county batsmen\" during the 1930s, and is well known for his then-world record hitting of thirty-two runs from a single over against Hampshire. He ended his career with the record number of sixes for any Glamorgan player at the time.Smart, whose father also played cricket for Wiltshire, played sporadically for Warwickshire between 1920 and 1922, but found little success. After being away from cricket for five years he returned by playing for Glamorgan from 1927 onwards, however again only featured occasionally. However in 1934 he played a full season, scoring over 1,000 runs \u2013 a landmark he would then go on to consistently achieve until the outbreak of the Second World War, as well as breaking the world record for runs scored from off one single over, and club records for partnerships and six-hitting. After the war he returned for one final season, however reaped little reward and left the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Smart (cricketer)", "response": ["Smart was born in Forest Hill near Marlborough in Wiltshire, into a cricketing family.
