For the 1893\u201394 season, manager Dick Molyneux used a reasonably settled first team, with eleven players appearing in 20 or more of the 30 league matches. As a result, it was not until 23 December that Parry played his first game of the season, replacing England international Bob Howarth at right back after Howarth suffered \"lameness\". The match against Sheffield Wednesday ended in an 8\u20131 victory, with four goals from Jack Southworth, and was followed a week later by a 7\u20131 victory over West Bromwich Albion in which Southworth scored a further six goals. For the latter match, Parry lined up alongside his fellow Welsh international, Smart Arridge at left back. Parry retained his place in the side for a further seven matches, switching to left back on Howarth's return, but was replaced by Dickie Boyle on 24 March, after a run of four defeats. On 19 March, Parry had again been in trouble with the board \"for not attending training etc.\"; as a result he was suspended for a fortnight and had his bonuses revoked. Parry was recalled to the team for the last two matches of the season.", "Parry's best match for Wales came in the 1\u20131 draw against England in March 1895. For the next three matches, Parry was appointed captain in the absence of James Trainer, leading his team to a 6\u20131 victory over Ireland on 29 February 1896, with two goals each from Billy Lewis and Billy Meredith, although this was followed by a 9\u20131 defeat by England, for whom Steve Bloomer scored five goals.

This meant that Jack Hillman was the undisputed first choice goalkeeper for the season and would go on to play all bar the final game in which Harry Briggs made his club debut in a 2\u20131 victory at Stoke. Bob Kelso, Charlie Parry and James Adams resumed their battle for the two full back positions from the previous season. Adams missed the first game of the season but returned to miss just one other game as he established himself as the first choice full back but Both Kelso and Parry fell out of favour as reserve, Smart Arridge emerged as a solid full back partner to Adams. Kelso, who played the first five games of the season, made just one further appearance for the club in the half back line before leaving to join Dundee in February. Parry's long love, hate relationship with the Goodison Park club finally came to an end after his second appearance of the season when he gave away a penalty, which was missed, in a 3\u20134 defeat at Aston Villa in September.Liverpool Mercury Newspaper 1 October 1895 Before the year was out the Welsh International defender had moved on to Ardwick.", "|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Smart Arridge"]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["Elsewhere the familiar half back line of Boyle, Holt & Stewart would line up in front of full back, Smart Arridge, who would be partnered in defence this year by David Storrier after James Adams had returned to his former club Hearts", "|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Smart Arridge"]}, {"page": "Arridge", "response": ["#REDIRECT Smart Arridge"]}]}}
