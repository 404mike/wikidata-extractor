Manson identified lateral-spined eggs in the faeces of a colonial officer earlier posted to the West Indies, and concluded that there were two species of Schistosoma. An Italian-British physician Louis Westenra Sambon gave the new names Schistosomum haematobium and Schistosomum mansoni in 1907, the latter to honour Manson. Sambon only gave partial description using a male worm. In 1908, a Brazilian physician Manuel Augusto Piraj\u00e1 da Silva gave a complete description of male and female worms, including the lateral-spined eggs. Piraj\u00e1 da Silva obtained specimens from three necropsies and eggs from 20 stool examinations in Bahia. He gave the name S. americanum. The species identity was confirmed in 1907 by British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper, identifying the specific snail host, and distinguishing the egg structure, thereby establishing the life cycle."]}, {"page": "Schistosoma haematobium", "response": ["The infectious nature was discovered by British physician Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915.

Snails of the species Bithynia are the first intermediate hosts, fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae are the second intermediate host, and the definitive hosts are humans and other mammals such as dogs, cats, rats, and pigs. It was first discovered in the Indian fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrus) by M.J. Poirier in 1886. The first human case was discovered by Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915.", "O. viverrini was first described by a French parasitologist Jules Poirier in 1886, who discovered the parasite in an Indian fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrus), originally from Southeast Asia, that died in the Zoological Gardens attached to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. He named it Distomum viverrini. American parasitologists Charles Wardell Stiles and Albert Hassall redescribed it and assigned it to the existing genus Opisthorchis (created by a French zoologist Rapha\u00ebl Blanchard) in 1891. The first human specimen was described by a British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915, but without knowing the exact parasite. (He simply reported it as \"Notes of the occurrence of parasites presumably rare in man.\") Leiper received the specimens from an Irish medical doctor, Arthur Francis George Kerr, who had collected them from the post mortem examination of two prisoners at a jail in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. In the next year, Kerr himself reported from investigation of 230 male prisoners that 39 (17 percent) of them had the infection. Kerr initially misidentified the parasite as O. felineus, an already known human parasite, because of their close resemblance. C. Prommas also reported O. felineus in 1927 from an autopsy of a 17-year-old Thai male residing in Roi Et, northeast Thailand. It was in 1955 when Elvio H. Sadun from the U. S. Public Health Service analysed the cases of opisthorchiasis in Thailand and concluded that all the infections were due to O. viverrini. A systematic comparison in 1965 confirmed the differences from O. felineus."]}, {"page": "Warwick School", "response": ["* Robert Thomson Leiper"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society J, K, L", "response": ["| Robert Thomson Leiper||3 May 1923||17 April 1881 \u2013 21 May 1969 Parasitologist, London"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1923", "response": ["*Robert Thomson Leiper"]}, {"page": "Leiper", "response": ["* Robert Thomson Leiper (1881\u20131969), a British parasitologist and helminthologist"]}, {"page": "1941 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Robert Thomson Leiper, Esq., D.Sc., M.D., F.R.S., F.R.C.P., Professor of Helminthology in the University of London and a Director of the Department of Parasitology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine."]}, {"page": "Timeline of deworming", "response": ["| 1915 || Discovery || Robert Thomson Leiper works out the life-cycle of schistosomiasis. || Schistosomiasis ||"]}, {"page": "Old Warwickians", "response": ["* Robert Thomson Leiper, parasitologist and helminthologist"]}, {"page": "David Owen Morgan", "response": ["In the First World War he served in the Royal Signal Corps and was wounded.

Theodor Maximillian Bilharz, a German physician at the Kasr el-Aini Hospital in Cairo recovered the adult fluke from a dead soldier in 1851. He named it Distomum haematobium. The disease is often called bilharzia in honour of the discoverer. The infectivity and life cycle was discovered by Scottish physician Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915. A British Surgeon Reginald Harrison, at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, was the first to note its role in cancer. In 1889, he found that four people out of five cancer victims had bilharzia. A German physician Carl Goebel confirmed in 1903 that bladder tumour occurred in most bilharzia patients. By 1905, he was convinced that carcinoma of bladder was due to bilharzia."]}]}}
