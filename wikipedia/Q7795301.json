Both club and team were struggling. Over the 34-match season they conceded 141 goals, lost 18 consecutive matches, and were beaten 10\u20130 on three occasions; it would be their last season in the Football League. According to the Athletic News, he made a very promising display on his debut on 25 February 1899, playing at left back at home to Glossop North End. He played in nine more matches, including Darwen's last at Football League level, in which he and full-back partner Thomas Woolfall were \"fast, cool and clever\" as Darwen secured a 1\u20131 draw with Newton Heathsoon to rename themselves Manchester United."]}]}}
