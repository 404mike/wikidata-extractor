He was of Sephardic or Spanish Jewish descent.Mendoza was the most accomplished and scientific fighter of his time; he was intelligent, communicative, a master of ring strategy and defense, and several rungs above his contemporaries. His life was a study in contrasts, however.  He could be brave, kind, and charismatic, or dangerously violent, and was found guilty of crimes of fraud and assault in 1793 and 1795.  His poor money management skills and lack of business acumen landed him in debtors' prison on several occasions.  Regardless of his shortcomings, he revolutionized self-defense with his book The Art of Boxing, became an heroic and admired figure, and elevated the status of Jews in London during a period of significant antisemitism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Sellers was born on 8 September 1925, in Southsea, a suburb of Portsmouth.

In 1719, he set up a 'pugilistic foundation' and charged himself as 'a professional in the Noble Science of Defense' to instruct boxers on the utilization of clench hands, sword, and quarterstaff. Noted champions were Jack Broughton, Elizabeth Wilkinson, Daniel Mendoza, Jem Belcher, Hen Pearce, John Gully, Tom Cribb, Tom Spring, Jem Ward, James Burke, William \"Bendigo\" Thompson, Ben Caunt, William Perry, Tom Sayers and Jem Mace.", "Even though Broughton's era brought rules to make boxing more civilized, there were still many moves in this era that are illegal in today's gloved boxing. That being said, there were also new revolutionary techniques that were formulated during this time. Grappling was allowed during this time and many favored the use of cross-buttocks throw and suplexes, although grabs below the waist were illegal.Chill, Adam.

The historic bout took place on a stage at Hornchurch in Essex. Heavyweight Jackson was five years younger,  taller, and  heavier than the middleweight Mendoza.  The bout was only Jackson's third professional fight, but Mendoza's age, recent months in prison, and years of punishment in the ring gave the advantage to Jackson, the fresher and less battered combatant. Due to his lack of experience, Jackson was a 10-1 underdog in the betting.", "With the recognition his new title brought, Jackson created a boxing academy for gentlemen at 13 Bond Street, in the West End of London, where he also resided, around 1803.  Jackson is credited with a scientific style of boxing, which he taught at his academy three times a week during the London Season. His style was partly patterned after the revolutionary scientific boxing style of Daniel Mendoza, which was described in Mendoza's book, The Art of Boxing, published in 1789.  It required adopting a posture of a slightly bent body, with head and shoulders forward, and knees slightly bent and at ease.  Demonstrated above by Mendoza, the fists were held well up for defense in a position called the \"guard\".  The left straight jab was used to keep an opponent at a distance and protect from an attack. Jackson created rules in the fights he managed which included using fists alone, rather than scrapping with the entire body, and made hair holding and kicking illegal.  Up to fifty rounds could be fought, however, and gloves, though available, were not used regularly until 1867.
