The club were forced to vacate their Anfield Road home and set up at a brand new venue of Goodison Park, leaving behind them their first choice left back, Duncan McLean and forward Alan Wylie. The latter probably realised that the return from injury of Fred Geary would see him left out of the front line but McLean's decision was a surprise to the club and fans and Bob Howarth found himself with six full back partners during the season. For the second year in a row the club struggled to find a first choice keeper as six different custodians filled that role as well, including Joey Murray on three occasions, despite his normal position being as a forward. The indecision in goal was more down to the selectors than poor performance as each defeat the club suffered in the first half of the campaign was met with the keeper being dropped. Eventually the selectors settled for Richard Williams whose regular clean sheets in the latter half of the season saw the club rally to finish the season in third place and reach the cup final."]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["Bob Howarth was the biggest name to leave Goodison Park during the summer as he returned to Preston North End. This gave Charlie Parry the chance to win back the left back shirt that he had lost when Howarth had arrived two years earlier. Reserve goalkeepers, John Whitehead and David Jardine both moved on, to Liverpool and Nelson respectively to seemingly cement Richard Williams' place between the posts. Two other fringe players, defender, Billy Lindsay and half back, Jack Walker left in search of regular first team football at Grimsby and Ardwick respectively. The only major inclusion to the first team squad was the signing of Tom McInnes from Scottish side Third Lanark. He instantly slotted into the inside right birth while Jack Bell moved out to outside left with Alf Milward making way."]}, {"page": "Charlie Parry", "response": ["In September 1893, Parry was suspended for two weeks with no pay for drunkenness. For the 1893\u201394 season, manager Dick Molyneux used a reasonably settled first team, with eleven players appearing in 20 or more of the 30 league matches. As a result, it was not until 23 December that Parry played his first game of the season, replacing England international Bob Howarth at right back after Howarth suffered \"lameness\". The match against Sheffield Wednesday ended in an 8\u20131 victory, with four goals from Jack Southworth, and was followed a week later by a 7\u20131 victory over West Bromwich Albion in which Southworth scored a further six goals. For the latter match, Parry lined up alongside his fellow Welsh international, Smart Arridge at left back. Parry retained his place in the side for a further seven matches, switching to left back on Howarth's return, but was replaced by Dickie Boyle on 24 March, after a run of four defeats. On 19 March, Parry had again been in trouble with the board \"for not attending training etc.\"; as a result he was suspended for a fortnight and had his bonuses revoked. Parry was recalled to the team for the last two matches of the season.", "Following the departure of Bob Howarth at the start of the 1894\u201395 season, Parry \"made the left back his own\" with former Scotland international James Adams alongside him on the right. Parry only missed three matches as Everton finished as runners-up in the Football League, five points behind Sunderland."]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Bob Howarth"]}, {"page": "1889 World Championship (football)", "response": ["|FB |||| Bob Howarth"]}]}}
