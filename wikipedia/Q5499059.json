Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The purpose of these structures has long been debated among botanists. Frederick William Burbidge suggested that they might serve to deter arboreal mammals such as tarsiers, lorises and monkeys from stealing the contents of the pitchers.Slack, A. 1979. Nepenthes bicalcarata. In: Carnivorous Plants. Ebury Press, London. p.\u00a082. In an article published in 1982, Cliff Dodd speculated on the function of the thorns, but did not believe they play a role in prey capture.Dodd, C. 1982. The most dangerous (looking) Nepenthes. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 11(3): 64\u201365, 73, 78. Charles Clarke observed that monkeys and tarsiers rip the pitchers open at the sides in order to feed from them, rather than reaching in through the pitcher mouth.Clarke, C.[M.] 1993. The possible functions of the thorns of Nepenthes bicalcarata (Hook.f.) pitchers. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 22(1\u20132): 27\u201328. However, he found that the mammals attacked the pitchers of N.\u00a0bicalcarata less frequently than those of other species, such as N.\u00a0rafflesiana. Clarke's observations suggest that the spines likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the pitcher fluid, eventually drowning. A similar trapping method is employed by the Sumatran endemic N.\u00a0lingulata, which has a single filiform appendage positioned over the pitcher mouth. However, in that species the appendage is a structure of the lid and not the peristome.Lee, C.C., Hernawati & P. Akhriadi 2006. Two new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North Sumatra.
