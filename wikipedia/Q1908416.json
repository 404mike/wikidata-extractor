The series evolved from Clemens' previous work, in particular two films in a similar style: And Soon the Darkness (1970) and Blind Terror (aka See No Evil, 1971); the latter shares plot similarities with the Thriller episodes The Eyes Have It and The Next Voice You See. Original music, including the theme-tune, was supplied by Clemens' regular collaborator Laurie Johnson.", "Other memorable episodes include: Someone at the Top of the Stairs, one of a handful of forays into the supernatural, in which two female students move into a boarding house and begin to notice that none of the other residents ever go out or receive any mail; and I'm The Girl He Wants to Kill, in which a witness to a murder finds herself trapped in a deserted office-block overnight with the killer, and is forced to play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with him to survive (there is barely any dialogue throughout its second half). Brian Clemens' own favourite episode, A Coffin for the Bride (US: Kiss Kiss, Kill Kill), featured a performance from a young Helen Mirren."]}, {"page": "The Golden Voyage of Sinbad", "response": ["Screenwriter Brian Clemens helped Munro land the role of Margiana:", "\"I got the part \u2013 I had been signed by Hammer, for one year, for a contract, out of which I did two films, one being Dracula AD 1972, and the second one being Captain Kronos \u2013 Vampire Hunter, which, kind of, would come full-circle, to Sinbad.

So, they said \"No\", but, eventually, Brian persuaded them to do that, and they saw the rushes, and that was how I got the part.\"Caroline Munro Interview .

We felt there was a new audience that was ready for it. We knew of no other producers who were considering this type of material, largely because they probably didn\u2019t know how to handle it on a basis where it became economically viable.\" Harryhausen did a dozen master sketches which, Schneer said \"we felt would be intriguing and interesting and characteristic of the period.\" They then hired Brian Clemens to do a screenplay based on the sketches.
