Initial estimates by the sponsors of the Winston Churchill Statue Appeal put the cost of the statue at \u00a330,000. The sponsors of the appeal included Edward Heath, Lord Mountbatten, Lord Portal, and Baroness Elliot. The sum of \u00a332,000 was raised by 4,500 individuals who are listed in a book which was deposited in the library at Chartwell on Churchill's birthday, 30 November 1973. The statue was cast by the Meridian Foundry of Peckham Rye, London."]}, {"page": "Tilney", "response": ["*John Tilney (190794), British businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "Tilney, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Tilney"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Sir John Tilney"]}]}}
