He joined Harvard in 1974, received many awards for his research, and remained at Harvard until his death, leaving the faculty for a decade to serve as Dean. Knowles died on 3 April 2008 at his home.In 2006, he was selected by incoming interim president Derek Bok to return to his position as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on an interim basis, replacing William C.

Once other people successfully move into an area, he tends to look for new and more interesting problems to solve. \"He has done that repeatedly by asking fundamental questions of what seemed to everyone to be virtually intractable problems,\" according to Jeremy R.
