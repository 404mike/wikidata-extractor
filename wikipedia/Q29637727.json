In August 2021, Hanlan was subject to a bid from League One side Lincoln City, rejected by Bristol Rovers as the fee offered was less than the sum the club had recently paid following the outcome of the tribunal.

Brentford's first match after the transfer window was against Aston Villa. Despite a good performance, they could not find a goal to give them their first league victory as the match ended 0\u20130. On 12 September, Brentford travelled to Hillsborough where they let a lead slip to give Sheffield Wednesday a win. Yennaris scored early with a volley but Gary Hooper netted on the brink of half-time and Ross Wallace completed the comeback from Jordan Rhodes' pull-back. There was concern late into stoppage time as defender Dalsgaard was knocked unconscious and given treatment on the pitch for several minutes before being taken off on a stretcher. Brentford continued their win-less streak in the league at home to Reading. Clarke rifled in from a tight angle after good play between himself and Maupay but Liam Kelly equalised with a penalty after Rico Henry fouled Tyler Blackett as the game ended 1\u20131. On 18 September, central defender Chris Mepham signed a five-year contract and was promoted to the first team squad. The next day, he made his first competitive start, along with Theo Archibald, in the third round of the League Cup against Norwich City where he gave away the penalty for Norwich's first goal. After Marco Vrancic scored from the spot, Brentford were awarded a penalty themselves, but Yoann Barbet skied it into the stands. Vrancic then curled in a free kick in the second half and Josh Murphy chipped over the oncoming Daniels to give the Canaries a three-goal advantage. Clarke scored a consolation late on as Brentford crashed out of the League Cup, losing 3\u20131. Brentford finally found their first league win of the season against bottom side Bolton Wanderers. Barbet made amends for his penalty miss in the cup with a superb free-kick in the first half. Yennaris then scored from 30 yards in the second half with Watkins adding a third shortly before full-time. On 26 September, Brentford hosted Derby County at Griffin Park. Despite completely dominating, Brentford could not break down the Derby defence and found themselves behind to Joe Ledley's debut goal for the Rams. It took 86 minutes for Watkins to find a deserved equaliser to grab a point for the Bees. Brentford picked up their sixth draw of the season against Middlesbrough. Despite scoring two goals, courtesy of Barbet's header and Watkins' finish, Middlesbrough came back from behind twice through Martin Braithwaite and Fabio to secure a 2\u20132 result. Henry was stretchered off in this game and suffered a serious knee injury which would sideline him for a significant length of time.", "| 1 September 2017 || MF || Zain Westbrooke ||  Solihull Moors || 29 September 2017 || ", "| 11 October 2017 || MF || Zain Westbrooke ||  Leyton Orient || 10 January 2018 || ", "| Zain Westbrooke", "| Zain Westbrooke"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["| 25 ||Zain Westbrooke||CM||||Chertsey||||0||0||Brentford||10 May 2018||Free||30 June 2020", "| 25 ||  || Zain Westbrooke || MF || 3+4 || || || 0+1 || 8"]}]}}
