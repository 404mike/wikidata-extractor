As for many women whose true desire lay in getting to the thick of the action on the frontlines, however, Whitehead initially started her war-work away from the firing lines. Travelling to London, England, Whitehead volunteered, alongside \"a batch of young ladies from Canada\", to work \"long hours over the card index and the typewriter in order to\", as the Yorkshire Evening Post reported on June 3, 1915, \"keep the people of\" her \"own country informed of the condition of the wounded among the Canadian contingent\".\"Lady Volunteers From Canada\", Yorkshire Evening Post, June 3, 1915. This newspaper described \"Miss Whitehead\" as \"a lady volunteer of a very different kind\" because she could \"do almost anything in the out-of-door life\", and was \"desirous of putting her handiness at the disposal of the military authorities\". During the Great War, however, the Western Front was completely forbidden to women. Conflict zones were deemed far too dangerous a place for the \"weaker sex\" to be, with some even considering it an abomination that the female life-giver should enter the battlefield, where she stood to witness brutal and unrelenting loss of life. The few females that did get to this front were, then, either branded \"camp followers\" (i.e. prostitutes) or, as in the case of sapper Dorothy Lawrence (the only English woman to cross-dress as a soldier and to gain access to the Western Front in this capacity), sent back to England in a state of disgrace. Whitehead was, however, determined in her goal. Like the women doctors of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, she decided to offer her services to Britain and the Commonwealth's Allies; a decision that would ultimately lead her to Serbia. It was following this Balkan country's acceptance of her help that Whitehead became a volunteer engineer with the Serbian Relief Fund in July 1915."]}]}}
