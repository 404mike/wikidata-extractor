However he overrode Chauvel's own preference to appoint a Royal Horse Guards officer, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse, known as \"Wombat\", as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps. A \"brass-bound brigadier\" was quoted as saying, \"Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world's history to an Australian.\" On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, \"I cannot say how much I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand \u2013 it is my own trade \u2013 but Fate has willed it otherwise.\"Murat's Reserve Cavalry in 1805 had been 22,000 while Bessieres' Reserve Cavalry in 1809 had been 29,000, both larger than Chauvel's 20,000. Hill notes the war establishment of a mounted division in July 1917 was 7,991, so Chauvel would have commanded about 24,000. He also notes the reference to \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\" in the name of a film directed by Charles Chauvel, (Chauvel's nephew) was a myth. [Hill 1978 pp. 119\u201320, note] At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa. Chetwode's \"arms length\" style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza.", "The dedication of the Shrine of Remembrance in 1934 saw a series of reunions. Ian and Edward arrived from India on leave, Alexander Godley came from Britain, and Richard Howard-Vyse as chief of staff to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. In 1937, Chauvel travelled to the United Kingdom as head of the Australian contingent for the coronation of King George VI, where he was welcomed by Chetwode and Howard-Vyse. Chauvel had the contingent dressed as light horsemen, wearing emu plumes, bandoliers and spurs. When the Dominion troops assembled at Buckingham Palace to receive their King George VI Coronation Medals, Chauvel led the parade, with Howard-Vyse as his chief of staff. On the way back, the contingent visited France, where ceremonies were held at the Villers\u2013Bretonneux Australian National Memorial and the Arc de Triomphe. Chauvel frequently led Anzac Day parades through Melbourne but resigned from the leadership of the march in 1938 in protest against a decision by the Returned and Services League of Australia to change the form of service at the Shrine from a Christian to a secular one."]}, {"page": "Desert Mounted Corps", "response": ["::General Staff, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse"]}, {"page": "Howard Vyse", "response": ["He married, 13 November 1810 Frances,Abstract of the marriage settlement of Richard William Howard-Vyse and Frances Hesketh  [no ref.  24 October 1810 at Centre for Buckinghamshire Studies] second daughter of Henry Hesketh of Newton, Cheshire.
