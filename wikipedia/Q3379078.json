Stainton appeared in several Ealing comedies and major international movies. He specialized in playing friendly or exasperated uniformed policemen, but also appeared  in other comic and straight roles in British and Australian productions.\nAfter beginning in repertory, in the postwar years he worked steadily in bit and featured parts in theatrical films; twice being directed by John Ford and once by John Huston when they shot on European or overseas locations. He first visited Australia as part of a touring company presenting Agatha Christie\u2019s play  Witness for the Prosecution.\nStainton and his actress wife immigrated to Australia in the late 1950s to appear in a series of live television plays as the medium was beginning in that country. From 1957 to 1959 he had the distinction to headline the first Australian sitcom Take That which was broadcast in Melbourne by HSV-7.\nHe also adapted and produced a version of the gaslight melodrama East Lynne which became a hit around the circuit of surviving music hall venues in the early 1960s and was subsequently revived. During a centenary performance at impresario George Miller\u2019s Bowl Music Hall (basement of The Capitol, Melbourne), he succumbed to a heart attack on 1 August 1961.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ladykillers", "response": ["*Philip Stainton as the Station Sergeant"]}, {"page": "Mogambo", "response": ["* Philip Stainton as John Brown-Pryce"]}, {"page": "Passport to Pimlico", "response": ["* Philip Stainton as PC Spiller"]}, {"page": "Scott of the Antarctic (film)", "response": ["* Philip Stainton as Second Questioner"]}, {"page": "Ealing comedies", "response": ["Many of the films were built around a repertory group of actors, screenwriters, directors and technicians.
