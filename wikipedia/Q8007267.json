The family lived at Brighton from 1783, where Andrew Crawford was Postmaster of Brighton (then \"Brighthelmston\").William Crawford spent his early career with the Honourable East India Company and made a fortune in India. He returned to England in around 1812, and was a partner in the East India Mercantile House (i.e. trading company) of Crawford, Colvin and Company. (See the Colvin family for more on the Anglo-Indian links.) He bought the estate of Pippbrook, near Dorking, Surrey in 1817 and made it his country home. From 1824 until his death, Crawford was a director of the Australian Agricultural Company. In 1827 he was High Sheriff of Surrey.\nHe had a house at Eaton Square, in the fashionable West End of London. He was a director of the Alliance Assurance Company and an alderman of the City of London in the Spectacle Makers' Company. In 1832 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Brighton at the general election in 1832, the first after the Reform Act. He was returned as Member of Parliament for the City of London in August 1833, and sat until he lost the seat in the Tory swing of June 1841. He was in favour of the abolition of the window tax and opposed the Corn Laws and short parliaments.  He died at Woodmansterne, Surrey and was buried in St Peter's Church there.\nCrawford married Dorothy Elizabeth Rees at Bombay on 11 January 1802.

Charles Barclay (a Southwark brewery owner) and the bankers Joseph Denison and Thomas Hope (none of whom had any previous connection with the area) purchased the estates at Bury Hill, Denbies and Deepdene respectively. Higher-status individuals living closer to the town centre included William Crawford, the City of London MP, and Jane Leslie, the Dowager Countess of Rothes. Although the incoming landowners played little part in local commerce, they appear to have been the driving force behind schemes to pave streets and to provide gas lighting (both paid for by public subscription)."]}, {"page": "William Crawford", "response": ["William Crawford may refer to:", "* William Crawford (knight), character in epic poem about Scottish knight William Wallace", "* William Crawford (soldier) (1732\u20131782), soldier in American Revolution, burnt at the stake by Native Americans", "* William Crawford (Royal Navy officer) (1907\u20132003), British admiral", "* William Crawford (Pennsylvania politician) (1760\u20131823), American Representative from Pennsylvania", "* William Crawford (Virginia politician) (died 1762), politician in Virginia House of Burgesses, founder of Portsmouth, Virginia", "* William Crawford (London MP) (1780\u20131843), British MP for the City of London, 1833\u20131841", "* William Crawford (trade unionist) (1833\u20131890), British MP for Mid Durham, 1885\u20131890", "* William Crawford (Canadian politician) (1847\u20131897), Canadian surveyor and politician in Manitoba", "* William Crawford (judge) (1784\u20131849), United States federal judge", "* William Crawford (artist) (1822\u20131869), Scottish painter", "* William Crawford & Sons, former British biscuit company"]}, {"page": "Douglas Freshfield", "response": ["Born in London, Freshfield was the only son of Henry Ray Freshfield and his wife Jane Quinton Crawford.
