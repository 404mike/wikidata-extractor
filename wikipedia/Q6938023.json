In the fallout from the Heysel Stadium disaster, fan relationships became strained when the actions of Liverpool-supporting hooligans caused both Liverpool and Everton to be banned from European club competition despite no involvement from the latter. Relations improved after the Hillsborough disaster when both sets of fans rallied together, with Evertonians even joining in on the boycott of The Sun, while Everton and Liverpool scarves were intertwined and stretched across Stanley Park between the two teams' stadiums. After the murder of 11-year-old Evertonian Rhys Jones in 2007, Liverpool invited his parents and older brother to Anfield for a Champions League match as a sign of respect. The Z-Cars theme tune, to which Everton players traditionally run out, was played for the first time ever at Anfield while Jones' family stood on the pitch wearing Everton shirts and scarves. A standing ovation was then given before \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" was played. Upon the vindication of Liverpool fans related to the Hillsborough disaster in August 2012, Everton hosted Newcastle United at Goodison Park, and the sides were led out by two children wearing Everton and Liverpool shirts with numbers 9 and 6 on the back; an announcer read out the names of all 96 Hillsborough victims while \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\" played to a standing ovation."]}, {"page": "Jack McMullen", "response": ["In May 2017, McMullen appeared in the ITV drama series, Little Boy Blue, portraying Dean Kelly, one of the gang members involved in the murder of Rhys Jones in 2007."]}, {"page": "Br\u00edan F.

Since then, coverage has mainly been restricted to the local press and the Internet, except for the funeral, which received wider coverage. In February 2008, The Observer compared the limited amount of coverage the Lancaster case received to the large amount of coverage worldwide which the media paid to the case of discrimination faced by a Yorkshire goth couple who were thrown off a bus: \"That the story received just a fraction of the coverage  by the dog-lead goths tells you something about society.
