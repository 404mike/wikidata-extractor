The result was the election of Labour candidate Sylvia Heal to succeed the previous Conservative Member of Parliament John Heddle, who had precipitated the byelection by committing suicide.", "Following criticism of Labour candidates for previous byelections, the party had set up a panel of five senior members to draw up shortlist of approved candidates, from which the local Constituency Labour Party would make the final selection. Deputy Leader Roy Hattersley was in charge of the process. A shortlist was drawn up during January, with some concerns being reported about whether the candidate from the 1987 election, Crispin St Hill, would be on it. St Hill was a black community worker from Brent and previous byelections had seen the party resist selecting black candidates for byelections. He did secure a place on the shortlist but the local party selected Sylvia Heal, who had made a prominent speech at the 1989 party conference supporting the leadership's change of policy on nuclear disarmament from unilateral disarmament to a multilateralist approach. Heal was a social worker and magistrate from Egham, Surrey, who had not previously fought an election.\"Britain Votes/Europe Votes By-election Supplement\", Parliamentary Research Services, 1990, p. 10", "The Labour campaign was very tightly controlled by the party officials, under the director of communications Peter Mandelson.Nicholas Wood, \"Labour hope sticks to script\", The Times, 20 March 1990 Heal held no public meetings and the morning press conferences were limited to 20 minutes (with senior party figures often replying rather than Heal); most of her campaign was conducted on personal appearances in pubs and clubs and 'Red Rose Rallies'. The other parties were angered by this approach, with Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown denouncing the way Sylvia Heal was \"packaged and handled .. as if she was some Walworth Road barbie woman\", and that her leaflets said nothing about her ideas or Labour policies.Richard Ford, \"Frustrated Tories hunt their opponent\", The Times, 14 March 1990 After initially implying that Heal was a 'birdbrain', the Conservatives switched to claiming her control by the party was done in order to conceal Labour policies. The Daily Mail sent a reporter armed with a long list of questions to try to get answers from Heal, but her minder Peter Snape determined to stop him.Ian Aitken, \"Loyal Tarzan no name-dropper\", The Guardian, 16 March 1990, p. 6 The Conservatives noted that at the 1989 Labour Party conference Heal had supported a motion to cut defence spending by \u00a35 billion.Patrick Wintour, \"Byelection panic button leaves Tories grounded\", The Guardian, 17 March 1990, p. 2", "As the campaign ended Sylvia Heal allowed herself to be \"somewhat optimistic\" and concentrated on appealing to their supporters against complacency. The party claimed its canvass had shown more than 50% support, and Roy Hattersley appealed for a resounding Labour victory to force changes in the poll tax.", "The result was reported as a \"spectacular defeat\" for Thatcher, and renewed speculation about whether there would be an attempt by Conservative MPs to remove her. Indeed, after her victory, Sylvia Heal declared that the \"dark age of Thatcherism is drawing to a close\".
