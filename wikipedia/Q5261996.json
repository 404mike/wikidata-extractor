The first Northern Irish runner to break 4 minutes for the mile, he was ranked number 1 in the U.K. and Ireland over 2 miles/3000 m, 3 miles/5000 m and cross country at various periods in the 1960s.\nHe was selected for nine consecutive International cross country races (later to be recognised as the World Cross country), finishing second in 1966 in Rabat, Morocco.  He competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics for Great Britain, finishing seventh in his initial heat for the 5000m race. He also competed in the 1966 European Championships, and the 1966 and 1970 Commonwealth Games.  He was the Irish record holder for various distances through this time.  At the 1970 Commonwealth Games, Graham picked up a virus which later developed into myalgic encephalomyelitis, ultimately ending his athletics career.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metres", "response": ["| 7 ||align=left| Derek Graham ||align=left|  || 14:21.6"]}, {"page": "International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|19667.5\u00a0mi (12.1\u00a0km)||Ben Assou El Ghazi || 36:22.1||Derek Graham || 36:29.6||Tracy Smith || 36:32.2"]}, {"page": "1965 European Cup (athletics)", "response": ["| Derek Graham||14:20.4"]}, {"page": "1962 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  40 || Derek Graham ||  || 46:34", "|align=center|  9 || align=left |  || align=left | Mick NevilleDerek GrahamJohn McDonnellPat KilleenBenny O'SullivanMick Connolly || 287"]}, {"page": "1963 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  45 || Derek Graham ||  || 40:01", "|align=center|  7 || align=left |  || align=left | Pat KilleenTom O'RiordanSean O'SullivanDerek GrahamMick NevilleJim Hogan || 210"]}, {"page": "1964 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  32 || Derek Graham ||  || 42:31", "|align=center|  6 || align=left |  || align=left | James HoganTom O'RiordanBertie MessittDerek GrahamMick NevilleFrank McDermott || 182"]}, {"page": "1965 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|   5 || Derek Graham ||  || 37:07", "|align=center| 10 || align=left |  || align=left | Derek GrahamJim McNamaraPat McMahonGeorge BlackburnBrendan DearyTony Murphy || 397"]}, {"page": "1966 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|Derek Graham || 36:29.6", "|align=center|  || Derek Graham ||  || 36:29.6", "|align=center|  9 || align=left |  || align=left | Derek GrahamTom O'RiordanJim McNamaraHarry SimpsonTony MurphyTony Hopkins || 325"]}, {"page": "1967 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|   9 || Derek Graham ||  || 36:44", "|align=center|  8 || align=left |  || align=left | Derek GrahamTom O'RiordanJim McNamaraHarry SimpsonPete FaganGeorge Blackburn || 304"]}, {"page": "1968 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  11 || Derek Graham ||  || 36:13", "|align=center| 11 || align=left |  || align=left | Derek GrahamRoy KernoghanMatt WilsonMike TeerMalcolm EdgerDavid Logue || 407"]}, {"page": "1969 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  25 || Derek Graham ||  || 38:14", "|align=center| 12 || align=left |  || align=left | Derek GrahamDavid LogueCyril PenningtonMalcolm EdgerMike TeerRoy Kernoghan || 480"]}, {"page": "1970 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  21 || Derek Graham ||  || 37:53", "|align=center| 12 || align=left |  || align=left | Derek GrahamMike TeerDavid LogueCyril PenningtonMalcolm EdgerAlfred Chivers || 410"]}, {"page": "1966 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 5000 metres", "response": ["| 4 || align=left | Derek Graham || align=left |  || 13:48.0 || ", "| 2 || align=left | Derek Graham || align=left |  || 13:55.0 || Q"]}, {"page": "Tracy Smith (runner)", "response": [" behind gold medalist Ben Assou El Ghazi of Morocco and silver medalist Derek Graham of Ireland."]}, {"page": "Ben Assou El Ghazi", "response": ["The 1966 season proved to be the greatest of El Ghazi's career.
