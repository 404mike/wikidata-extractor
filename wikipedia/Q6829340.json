Nevertheless, he signed Gary Ford from Leicester City for \u00a336,000, whilst Pearson had his contract cancelled by mutual consent. Michael Cole also arrived on loan from Ipswich Town. Rudge switched from a formation of 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133 and only one defeat followed in the next thirteen league games. As Barnes returned to Manchester, Richard O'Kelly was transferred to Walsall. Cole was replaced by another loanee Dean Holdsworth (from Watford), who found greater success with Vale. However Gary Hamson was forced to retire through injury. A 5\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers on 2 April helped the Vale into tenth place, giving Vale a faint hope of reaching the play-offs. Vale ended the season poorly however, winning just two of their final nine games.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Michael Cole", "|14||FW||||Michael Cole||1||0||0||0||1", "| January 1988 || FW ||  || Michael Cole || Ipswich Town || February 1988 || "]}]}}
