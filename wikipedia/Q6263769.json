He was raised to the peerage by Gladstone in 1893, and in 1905 was granted the Freedom of the City of Rutherglen (where his chemical works was based), following being honoured in the same fashion by Dumbarton two years earlier, in recognition of his philanthropic endeavours.\nWhite's persona as a generous and committed Scottish Presbyterian was at odds with his exploitation of the workers at his Shawfield Chemical Works, the source of his great wealth. Politician and leader of the nascent Labour Party, Keir Hardie, exposed the scandalous working conditions there in a series of pamphlets published in 1899 entitled White Slaves.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John White", "response": ["*John White, 1st Baron Overtoun (1843\u20131908), Scottish chemical manufacturer, supporter of religious causes, philanthropist and Liberal politician"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*John White, 1st Baron Overtoun, chemical manufacturer and philanthropist."]}, {"page": "Baron Overtoun", "response": ["#REDIRECT John White, 1st Baron Overtoun "]}, {"page": "John Campbell White, 1st Baron Overtoun", "response": ["#REDIRECT John White, 1st Baron Overtoun"]}, {"page": "John Campbell, 1st Baron Overtoun", "response": ["#REDIRECT John White, 1st Baron Overtoun"]}, {"page": "Lord Overtoun", "response": ["#REDIRECT John White, 1st Baron Overtoun"]}]}}
