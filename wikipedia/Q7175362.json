He was born in Birmingham and has three older brothers; the eldest John, Dave, who was also a goalkeeper and played over 200 games for Birmingham City, and more famously the Everton and England striker, Bob Latchford who also started his career at Birmingham City.\nLatchford spent most of his career in Scotland with Celtic, where he was known affectionately by the fans as 'Gas Meter' (rhyming slang for Peter) and 'The Cat'.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Peter Latchford \u2013 Footballer"]}, {"page": "Davie Cooper", "response": ["To the surprise of many, manager Jock Wallace abruptly left Rangers on 23 May 1978 and was replaced by John Greig. The club made a poor start to the 1978-79 season, failing to win their first six league encounters. Despite this however, they recorded victories against Juventus and PSV Eindhoven in the European Cup, with Cooper failing to be selected for the ties by Greig. A mixed season domestically followed and they had all but lost the title in a 4\u20132 away defeat to Celtic on 21 May 1979. Describing losing the championship, Cooper said \"you just want to emigrate as soon as you have got changed and walked out of the ground. It is like a spectre which haunts you for weeks.\" Despite this, Rangers won the 1979 Scottish League Cup Final in a 2\u20131 victory against Aberdeen and were victorious in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final, winning 3\u20132 over Hibernian. Tensions were beginning to rise between Cooper and Greig, mainly due to less-frequent selection of Cooper by the new manager. Cooper would often return home to Hamilton complaining the club he loved was \"kicking him in the teeth\". That season, Cooper made 49 appearances and scored ten goals. On 4 August 1979, Cooper scored a memorable solo goal against Celtic in the 1979 Drybrough Cup Final at Hampden. A crossed ball in from Alex MacDonald met Cooper at the edge of the box, where he went on to \"keepie up\" the ball over Roddie MacDonald, Murdo MacLeod, Tom McAdam and Alan Sneddon before slotting the ball past onrushing Celtic goalkeeper Peter Latchford. The goal was voted the greatest ever Rangers goal by Rangers fans and listed by The Guardian's Rob Smyth as the second greatest ever solo goal, after Diego Maradona's Goal of the Century. Sandy Jardine, who had scored a spectacular second goal for Rangers during the match, admitted his goal had been overshadowed by Cooper's. \"I scored one of my best goals that day,\" said Jardine, \"and it hardly got a mention.\""]}, {"page": "Bob Latchford", "response": ["Latchford's two brothers, Dave and Peter, were both professional goalkeepers. Like Bob, Dave Latchford played for Birmingham City; whilst Peter Latchford represented West Bromwich Albion before spending over ten years at Celtic.

Celtic were drawn against Real Madrid, and goals from George McCluskey and Johnny Doyle gave Celtic a 2\u20130 win in the first leg at Parkhead. Goalkeeper Peter Latchford had an excellent match, and in particular his saves from England striker Laurie Cunningham and Spanish star Santillana were crucial in helping Celtic keep a clean sheet. The return leg took place two weeks later at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in front of approximately 120,000 fans. Johnny Doyle missed an excellent chance to score early in the first half, and then just before half-time Santillana pulled a goal back for Real. Uli Stielike levelled the tie in the second half with a powerful volley past Latchford, before Juanito added a third near the end to send Celtic out 3\u20132 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "Allen McKnight", "response": ["McKnight signed for Celtic in August 1986, joining up again with his former Distillery teammate Anton Rogan who had arrived at Parkhead a few months earlier. He did not feature in any first-team games in his first year, and was loaned out to Albion Rovers to gain experience of the Scottish game. With the departure of Peter Latchford in the summer of 1987, McKnight rose up in the pecking order at Celtic to second-choice keeper, behind first choice Packie Bonner. McKnight played several games for Celtic at the start of season 1987\u201388 in place of Bonner who had contracted a virus.

Bonner regained his place in the team upon his recovery from illness, but McKnight's 12 league appearances and 5 clean sheets helped the club to win the League Championship.
