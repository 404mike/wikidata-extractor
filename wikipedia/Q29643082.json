The first description of a CCU was given in 1961 to the British Thoracic Society by Dr. Desmond Julian, who founded the first CCU at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1964. Early CCUs were also located in Sydney, Kansas City, Toronto and Philadelphia. The first coronary care unit in the US was opened at Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas by Dr Hughes Day, and he coined the term. Bethany Medical Center is also where the first \"crash carts\" were developed.Unplugged: Reclaiming Our Right to Die in America, William H.
