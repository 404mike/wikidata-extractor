At the suggestion of Joseph Pease they set up their first iron foundry and rolling mill at Vulcan Street, Middlesbrough, where they processed pig iron imported from Scotland. In 1846 the pair opened Witton Park Ironworks,  to the west of the town, where ironstone from Grosmont, could be smelted in blast furnaces to produce the pig iron for the Vulcan Street works. The high transport costs generated by this operation led the partners to look closer to home for their raw materials, and in the end they found what they were looking for on their own doorstep. In 1850, Vaughan and his geologist John Marley discovered large seams of iron ore at Eston, in the nearby Cleveland Hills.

The discovery of the Eston ironstone by Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan in 1850, accelerated the industrialisation of the area as the ironstone outcropped quite close to the surface and could be recovered more easily than on the coast, which was dependent on the tides, and from the mines further south, which had to go to greater depths to recover the stone. In August 1850, the find of stone was proved, and by December of the same year, the first shipment of ironstone, , was taken over a newly built tramway from Eston into Middlesbrough. The Rosedale mines developed in the 1860s, and were connected via a railway that ran across the moors, and down a steep incline near Ingleby Greenhow, which then joined with the main railway network at what would become  railway station.
