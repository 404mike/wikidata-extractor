Amongst the works illustrated in whole or in part by him were edition of David Hume's The History of England published by Wallis and Scholey, 1804\u201310; Robert Bloomfield's Wild Flowers, 1806; and poems by George Marshall, 1812. He had many pupils, including John Thompson (1785\u20131866). The work of Branston and Thompson can be compared in the illustrations to James Puckle's The Club, 1817. Branston projected a volume of fables in rivalry with those of Bewick after designs by Thurston, but after a few of them were cut he abandoned the enterprise. He also engraved a few cuts of birds to show his superiority to the Newcastle engraver; but though beautifully cut, they were essentially inferior to Bewick's."]}, {"page": "A History of British Birds (Yarrell book)", "response": ["The book is illustrated with over 500 drawings directly onto wood blocks, mostly by Alexander Fussell. These were then engraved by John Thompson. Publication was initially in 37 parts of three large folded sheets each; these were then collected and bound into volumes. Most of the copies were on octavo paper; some \"large paper\" format copies were printed in the larger royal octavo with just 50 copies in the very large imperial octavo format. Four editions were produced between 1843 and 1885.", "Alexander Fussell created most of the drawings for the book. Yarrell thanks Fussell in his Preface for \"nearly five hundred of the drawings on wood here employed\", and John Thompson (1785\u20131866) and his sons for the \"very long series of engravings\" of the drawings. He also thanks his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley for their care and skill. The pen for the remaining drawings, if any (the title page asserts there are 520 in the book), is not stated. As well as the figures of birds, there are 59 tail-pieces (following Bewick, small woodcuts to fill in the spaces at ends of articles), of which some are whimsical, like Bewick's, but many illustrate anatomical details, especially breastbones and windpipes, and others, although decorative, realistically depict aspects of bird behaviour or human interaction with birds. For example, the tail-piece for the \"Jack Snipe\" shows a bittern among reeds, swallowing a frog, while that for the \"Common Bittern\" shows \"a mode of shooting an Eagle from a pit\"."]}, {"page": "Edward Prentis", "response": ["Prentis also executed for the British Museum a series of drawings of the ivory objects and bronze bowls found at Nimrud.

In 1837 he prepared prints for John Antes Latrobe's The Solace of Song (Seeley & Burnside), a new departure in wood-engraving with a finish contrasting with the crisp work of Luke Clennell, Charlton Nesbit, and John Thompson. His contribution to the technique of wood-engraving was admired by contemporary commentators including one, writing in the London and Westminster Review  in 1838, that Orrin Smith was an \"able and intelligent cultivator of his art, and has introduced improvements and attempted effects ... which have advanced it.\"Henry Cole, 'Modern Wood Engraving', London and Westminster Review, July 1838, pp. 145\u201352 (151).
