In the same year he had another small part alongside Brian Cox in the futuristic drama The Year of the Sex Olympics.\nOne year later Potter's career took off with a much larger role. The Italian director Federico Fellini chose him for the main role of Encolpius in his film Satyricon. Terence Stamp, Fellini's original choice for the main role, was not available, and Fellini was looking for someone of a similar appearance.\nAfter this star role, Potter's career tended back to smaller roles again: mostly B-films and television productions like the film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's Olive. Among his more well-known parts are the history film Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) and the film The Big Sleep (with Robert Mitchum as private detective Philip Marlowe). He also appeared in horror films, including Craze with Jack Palance, and television series such as Doctor Who. In 1975 he achieved some popularity with the title part of Robin Hood in a TV mini-series The Legend of Robin Hood. In 1985 he again took a part in a production concerning Ancient Rome: the American mini-series A.D. in which he portrayed the Roman politician and opponent of Nero, Gaius Calpurnius Piso.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nicholas and Alexandra", "response": ["*Martin Potter as Prince Yusupov, one of Rasputin's assassins"]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| A.D. || NBC Productions / Telepictures Corporation || Stuart Cooper (director); Anthony Burgess (screenplay); Anthony Andrews, Colleen Dewhurst, Ava Gardner, David Hedison, John Houseman, Richard Kiley, James Mason, John McEnery, Ian McShane, Jennifer O'Neill, Millie Perkins, Denis Quilley, Fernando Rey, Richard Roundtree, Susan Sarandon, Ben Vereen, Tony Vogel, Jack Warden, Anthony Zerbe, Neil Dickson, Chris Humphreys, Amanda Pays, Philip Sayer, Diane Venora, Vincent Riotta, Rebecca Saire, Harold Kasket, Ralph Arliss, Mike Gwilym, Jonathan Hyde, Damien Thomas, Angela Morant, Paul Freeman, Andrea Prodan, Akosua Busia, Vernon Dobtcheff, Jane How, Martin Potter, Renato Scarpa, Stephen Finlay, David Haughton, John Steiner, Peter Blythe, Peter Howell, David Rintoul, Michael Wilding Jr., Tom Durham, Anthony Pedley, Davyd Harries, Bruce Winant, Derek Hoxby, Clive Arrindell, Gerrard McArthur, Jonathan Tafler, Richard Kane, Barrie Houghton, Maggie Wickman, Alan Downer, Colin Haigh, Roderick Horn, John Wheatley, Joss Buckley, David Sumner, Katia Thandoulaki, Eddie Grossman, Robert Wentz, Philip Anthony, Ned Vukovic || Drama, History || Live action"]}, {"page": "1970 in film", "response": ["*Goodbye Gemini, starring Judy Geeson, Martin Potter, Michael Redgrave and Alexis Kanner- (U.K.)"]}, {"page": "List of show business families", "response": ["*** Susie married actor, Martin Potter."]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Leonard RossiterSuzanne NeveTony VogelVickery TurnerBrian CoxGeorge MurcellMartin PotterPatricia MaynardDerek FowldsWolfe Morris"]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Leonard Rossiter,Suzanne Neve,Tony Vogel,Brian Cox,Vickery Turner,George Murcell,Martin Potter,Lesley Roach,Hira Talfrey,Patricia Maynard,Derek Fowlds,Wolfe Morris"]}, {"page": "The Big Sleep (1978 film)", "response": ["* Martin Potter as Owen Taylor"]}, {"page": "The Caesars (TV series)", "response": ["* Martin Potter as Nero Julius Caesar"]}, {"page": "Candace Glendenning", "response": ["She made her final feature film appearance in the 1976 independent horror film, Satan\u2019s Slave.
