Reading the book provoked him to \"[go] out into the field to see how far one could match the plant communities Warming had described for Denmark in the English countryside\". In 1903 he learned of the work done by the Smith brothers in mapping the vegetation of Scotland and Yorkshire. The work was initiated by Robert Smith and continued by his brother, William Gardner Smith (in conjunction with Charles Edward Moss) after Robert's death. In 1904 Tansley suggested the formation of a central body for the systematic survey and mapping of the British Isles. This led to the establishment of the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation by Tansley, Moss, William Smith and T. W. Woodhead, with the support of Marcel Hardy, F. J. Lewis, Lloyd Praeger and W. M. Rankin. These eight formed the original committee, with Tansley as its leader. F. W. Oliver later joined the group as its ninth member. The name of the group was later shortened to the British Vegetation Committee. The aim of the group was to coordinate ongoing studies and standardise the methodology being used. The committee met twice more in 1905 and produced a six-page pamphlet, Suggestions for Beginning Survey Work on Vegetation."]}, {"page": "Plant ecology", "response": ["Plant ecology developed within the wider discipline of ecology over the twentieth century. Inspired by Warming's Plantesamfund, Arthur Tansley set out to map British plant communities. In 1904 he teamed up with William Gardner Smith and others involved in vegetation mapping to establish the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, later shortened to British Vegetation Committee. In 1913, the British Vegetation Committee organised the British Ecological Society (BES), the first professional society of ecologists. This was followed in 1917 by the establishment of the Ecological Society of America (ESA); plant ecologists formed the largest subgroup among the inaugural members of the ESA."]}, {"page": "William Gardner Smith", "response": ["William Gardner Smith (February 6, 1927 \u2013 November 5, 1974) was an American journalist, novelist, and editor. Smith is linked to the black social protest novel tradition of the 1940s and the 1950s, a movement that became synonymous with writers such as Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Willard Motley, and Ann Petry. Smith's third book, South Street (1954), is considered to be one of the first black militant protest novels.

By the early 1960s, as a black American working in a foreign land and witness to injustice on two continents, the stakes were raised for Smith in the composition of this novel. It pushed his capacities as an artist, writer, and journalist to their limits. In this novel and his subsequent journalistic writing and reportage, Smith testified to the social, political, and cultural happenings of his adopted country as a way to explore and address everyday racism in the United States. In France, Smith was considered an expert on the racial situation in the United States, especially after he published a report in 1967 on the revolts within American black ghettos.\"Porte ouverte: William Gardner Smith\" (video interview in French), INA, September 5, 1967.", "*Bush, Joseph Bevans. \"On Re-Calling William Gardner Smith: Writer and Friend,\" Philadelphia Tribune, August 30, 1977, p.\u00a021.", "* Bryant Jerry H. \"Individuality and Fraternity: The Novels of William Gardner Smith,\" Studies in Black Literature, 3 (Summer 1972): 1\u20138.", "* Archives de France-Culture : Les nouvelles guerres culturelles aux Etats-Unis \u2013  Identit\u00e9s afro-am\u00e9ricaines, \u00e9mission du 25 ao\u00fbt 2006, avec William Gardner Smith en 1970 et Angela Davis.", "* FBI file on William Gardner Smith"]}, {"page": "Scotland's Rural College", "response": ["Botanists who have worked at the college have included Green Party politician Martin Ford, Noel Farnie Robertson (who ran the partnership between the college and the University of Edinburgh), William Gardner Smith and Edward Wyllie Fenton.
