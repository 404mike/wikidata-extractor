His session career has included work with artists including Justin Hayward, David Essex and Elkie Brooks.Ken is also considered by many to be the inventor of the string synthesiser, creating a prototype version of a polyphonic instrument at home in order to be able to mimic the sound of a string section more accurately in the studio. This instrument would eventually be released as the Freeman string symphonizer.Most recently in 2008, Ken has been working on a new version of the music he composed for the BBC series The Tripods, in addition to composing and performing with jazz fusion band Orion, with guitarist Steve Locke, bassist Ben Hutchings and drummer Fred Beale.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds", "response": ["* Ken Freeman \u2013 keyboards, synthesisers "]}, {"page": "The Tripods", "response": ["The television version of The Tripods was jointly produced by the BBC in the United Kingdom and the Seven Network in Australia.
