His research was in group theory. He also worked to reform mathematics education and became a county chess champion. The Hirsch length and Hirsch\u2013Plotkin radical are named after him.\nHe taught at the University of Leicester from 1938 (except for a brief internment as an enemy alien in 1940), moved to King's College, Newcastle in 1948, and then moved again to Queen Mary College in London in 1951, where he stayed for the remainder of his career and worked with K. W. Gruenberg.\nHirsch's doctoral students include Ismail Mohamed and Ascher Wagner.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 4", "response": ["*1986 \u2013 Kurt Hirsch, German-English mathematician and academic (b. 1906)"]}, {"page": "Rudolf Peierls", "response": ["Peierls commenced school a year late because he needed glasses, and his parents did not trust him not to lose them or break them.

He wanted to study engineering, but his parents, who doubted his practical abilities, suggested physics instead. He entered the University of Berlin, where he listened to lectures by Max Planck, Walther Bothe and Walther Nernst. Fellow students included Kurt Hirsch and K\u00e4te Sperling. The physics laboratory classes were overcrowded, so the first year students were encouraged to take theoretical physics courses instead.

Her Berlin-born father, Raimund Pretzel (Sebastian Haffner) had qualified as a lawyer, but abandoned the legal profession after 1933, and at the time of his daughter's birth was attempting \u2013 ultimately with considerable success \u2013 to reinvent himself as a journalist and author. He had fled from Germany with his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, whom the authorities had identified as Jewish, in 1938. The couple had only received permission to remain in Britain for twelve months, but they nevertheless married in the late summer of 1938, basing themselves in Cambridge where Kurt Hirsch, his wife's brother, had recently received his doctorate in mathematics from the university. The outbreak of war in September 1939 seems to have removed the threat that the British would send the little family back to Nazi Germany, but instead Raimund Pretzel was identified as an enemy alien and in February 1940 locked away in a prison camp in Devon. It was while he was in this camp that he (and the other prisoners) learned of his daughter's birth through a tannoy announcement: \"A little black head girl from Mister Pretzel\".   Shortly afterwards he was moved to the Isle of Wight."]}, {"page": "Ascher Wagner", "response": ["Ascher Wagner received his Ph.D. in 1958 with dissertation Some Problems on Projective Planes and Related Topics in the Theory of Algebraic Operations supervised by Kurt Hirsch.
