He, James Watson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin played crucial roles in deciphering the helical structure of the DNA molecule. Crick and Watson's paper in Nature in 1953 laid the groundwork for understanding DNA structure and functions. Together with Maurice Wilkins, they were jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research related to revealing the helical structure of DNA. He is widely known for the use of the term \"central dogma\" to summarise the idea that once information is transferred from nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) to proteins, it cannot flow back to nucleic acids. In other words, the final step in the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins is irreversible.During the remainder of his career, he held the post of J.W. Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. His later research centered on theoretical neurobiology and attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness. He remained in this post until his death; \"he was editing a manuscript on his death bed, a scientist until the bitter end\" according to Christof Koch.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 25", "response": ["*1953 \u2013 Francis Crick and James Watson publish \"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\" describing the double helix structure of DNA."]}, {"page": "Arthur Jensen", "response": ["Francis Crick considered that there was \"much substance to Jensen's arguments.\""]}, {"page": "Biochemistry", "response": ["Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the gene, and its role in the transfer of information in the cell.

Their double-helix model had two strands of DNA with the nucleotides pointing inward, each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form what look like rungs on a twisted ladder. This structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of DNA. The structure also suggested a simple method for replication: if the strands are separated, new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand. This property is what gives DNA its semi-conservative nature where one strand of new DNA is from an original parent strand.", "This messenger RNA molecule then serves to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called  translation. Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence, called a codon, corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence; this correspondence is called the genetic code.

Furthermore, Watson and Crick suggested that DNA, the genetic material, is responsible for the synthesis of the thousands of proteins found in cells. They had made this proposal based on the structural similarity that exists between the two macromolecules: both protein and DNA are linear sequences of monomers (amino acids and nucleotides, respectively).", "Once the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment was published, the scientific community generally acknowledged that DNA was the genetic code material.

The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller\u2013Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules, kickstarting decades of research into the chemical origins of life. By 1953, James D. Watson and Francis Crick clarified the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms,James D. Watson and Francis H. Crick. \"Letters to Nature: Molecular structure of Nucleic Acid.\" Nature 171, 737\u2013738 (1953). building on the work of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix.

The discipline of ecology typically traces its origin to the synthesis of Darwinian evolution and Humboldtian biogeography, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Equally important in the rise of ecology, however, were microbiology and soil science\u2014particularly the cycle of life concept, prominent in the work Louis Pasteur and Ferdinand Cohn. The word ecology was coined by Ernst Haeckel, whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930s, Arthur Tansley and others began developing the field of ecosystem ecology, which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of field biology."]}, {"page": "Irreducible complexity", "response": ["After James Watson and Francis Crick published the structure of DNA in the early 1950s, General Systems Theory lost many of its adherents in the physical and biological sciences."]}, {"page": "June 8", "response": ["*1916 \u2013 Francis Crick, English biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 2004)"]}, {"page": "July 28", "response": ["*2004 \u2013 Francis Crick, English biologist and biophysicist, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1916)"]}, {"page": "James Watson", "response": ["James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist, and zoologist.

This work began in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss biochemist who first proposed a structure called nuclein, which we now know to be deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. He discovered this unique substance by studying the components of pus-filled bandages, and noting the unique properties of the \"phosphorus-containing substances.\" Another notable contributor to the DNA model was Phoebus Levene, who proposed the \"polynucleotide model\" of DNA in 1919 as a result of his biochemical experiments on yeast. In 1950, Erwin Chargaff expanded on the work of Levene and elucidated a few critical properties of nucleic acids: first, the sequence of nucleic acids varies across species. Second, the total concentration of purines (adenine and guanine) is always equal to the total concentration of pyrimidines (cysteine and thymine). This is now known as Chargaff's rule. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published the double helical structure of DNA, using the X-ray crystallography work done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins.
