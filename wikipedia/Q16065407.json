As a player, Kynaston was active from 1830 to 1854. He played mainly for MCC teams but also represented Middlesex and played for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players series. A right-handed batsman who never bowled, he is recorded in 166 matches designated first-class, totalling 2,618 runs at the low average of 9.15 with a highest score of 54 and holding 43 catches.Kynaston was MCC's second Secretary, succeeding Benjamin Aislabie. He tried to improve conditions for cricket's professionals but, according to Pelham Warner, he was \"somewhat fussy\" and his relationships with the MCC staff were not always good. However, Warner points out that Kynaston held office during \"a difficult period\" of MCC's history. He was succeeded in 1858 by Alfred Baillie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of English cricket (1816\u20131863)", "response": ["Roger Kynaston succeeded Benjamin Aislabie as secretary of MCC (to 1858).", "Alfred Baillie succeeded Roger Kynaston as secretary of MCC (to 1863)."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Roger Kynaston 21", "Roger Kynaston 28"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Roger Kynaston"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Roger Kynaston"]}, {"page": "Harrison Dalton", "response": ["A batsman of unknown style, Dalton made a single appearance first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Oxford University in 1846 at the Magdalen Ground, Oxford.

Kynaston (Gentlemen)"]}, {"page": "Henry Royston", "response": ["Royston was born at Harrow on the Hill in August 1819. A professional all-round cricketer, he began his 25 year association with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1843, making his debut in first-class cricket for the club against Hampshire at Lord's. Throughout the 1840s, he played for a number of club sides and played his first-class cricket almost exclusively for the MCC, except for two appearances for an England XI in 1845 and 1847. He first played for Middlesex in 1850, debuting for the county in first-class matches against Surrey. He also made first-class appearances for several other teams, including the Players in the Gentlemen v Players match, for the South in the North v South fixture and for a United England Eleven amongst others. His four appearances for Middlesex were sporadic and spread over a period of twelve years, with his final appearance coming just two years before the formation of Middlesex County Cricket Club. It was for the MCC that he played the vast majority of his first-class matches for, making a total of 51 appearances between 1843\u201361. In these matches he scored 974 runs at an average of 12.02, with a high score of 60. Standing 5 foot 6 inches tall and bowling right-arm roundarm slow, he also took 91 wickets for the MCC at a bowling average of 11.28, with best figures of 8 for 44. He took five wickets in an innings on five occasions and took ten wickets in a match once. His appearances in club cricket continued into the 1850s and early 1860s, demonstrating that Royston was a sought after player, with him making guest appearances for the personal teams of many leading cricket figures of the day, including Sir Frederick Hervey-Bathurst, Robert Grimston and Roger Kynaston.
