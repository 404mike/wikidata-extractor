A right-handed batsman who never bowled, he is recorded in 166 matches designated first-class, totalling 2,618 runs at the low average of 9.15 with a highest score of 54 and holding 43 catches.Kynaston was MCC's second Secretary, succeeding Benjamin Aislabie. He tried to improve conditions for cricket's professionals but, according to Pelham Warner, he was \"somewhat fussy\" and his relationships with the MCC staff were not always good. However, Warner points out that Kynaston held office during \"a difficult period\" of MCC's history. He was succeeded in 1858 by Alfred Baillie.", "link_mentions": {}}}
