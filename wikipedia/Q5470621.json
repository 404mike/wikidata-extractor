He at first played fiddle, but later also took up the Northumbrian smallpipes. He was a major figure in the folk music revival during the 1950s and 1960s, and an active member of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society. He was a founder member of the High Level Ranters, playing fiddle and smallpipes on their first record, Northumberland for Ever, but he subsequently left the group. Later he played in a country dance band, The Borderers.\nHe was very active in recording traditional musicians in the area, notably Billy Pigg, and he would take a portable tape recorder to sessions and festivals. Several of these recordings were used to compile the record Billy Pigg, the Border Minstrel, while many more may be heard on the FARNE archive. Besides Billy Pigg, musicians he recorded include Joe Hutton, Diana Blackett-Ord, Richard Flemming and George Atkinson, as well as some duet recordings of himself with Colin Caisley. He also made, but did not retain, a recording of Tom Clough, late in the latter's life.\nHe was also a pipemaker, and is believed to have made the first concert-pitch Northumbrian smallpipe chanter, for Billy Pigg. Billy Pigg on pipes, John Doonan on piccolo and Forster Charlton on fiddle, liked to play as a trio, but smallpipes were traditionally pitched rather lower than modern concert pitch, and correcting for this, by using a very sharp reed in the smallpipes and pulling out the tuning slide of the piccolo, caused intonation problems. However it is not known whether Billy Pigg ever used this chanter regularly.He also had a great interest in other types of bagpipes. During the 1950s and 1960s, he invited prominent uilleann pipers, including the McPeakes, Seamus Ennis and Leo Rowsome, to Northumberland to play at concerts. Similarly, when the triennial International Bagpipe Festival at Strakonice in Southern Bohemia was founded, Josef Re\u017en\u00fd persuaded Charlton to come as a representative of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society. From 1968 until 1986, he, later with other pipers, would go to Strakonice. This connection led to some of Josef Re\u017en\u00fd's arrangements for Dudy of traditional Czech music, being adapted for smallpipes. He was planning another trip to Strakonice in 1989, despite his poor health, but died before it took place.\nHe was a prolific composer of tunes in traditional style, notably \"The Rowley Burn Hornpipe\".He was driving from his home in Gateshead to his brother's funeral in Lesbury, in northern Northumberland, when he had a fatal road accident.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northumbrian smallpipes", "response": ["*Forster Charlton"]}, {"page": "Billy Pigg", "response": ["During the 1950s Forster Charlton recorded his playing on many occasions; some of these can be heard on Radio FARNE. In 1958 Royce Wilson, an American working in Newcastle upon Tyne, acquired a tape recorder and made some recordings of him. Other recordings were made by the BBC and by the School of Scottish Studies. An album of selected recordings made by Forster Charlton was issued as Billy Pigg, the Border Minstrel on the Leader label in 1971, and re-released on CD in 2004. Through these recordings of Pigg's own compositions and his repertoire of traditional tunes, Pigg became influential throughout the world of bagpiping. Most players of the instrument will have several of Pigg's compositions in their repertoire."]}, {"page": "Tom Clough", "response": ["One other recording is known to have been made by Tom (III), late in his life, when his deafness was severe. This was made by Colin Ross and Forster Charlton, of Tom playing his variations on Nae Guid luck; while this recording was used to transcribe the piece for the Pipers' Society Tunebook, it was apparently not kept, as it was felt that it would not be fair on Tom to retain it."]}, {"page": "Colin Ross (pipemaker)", "response": ["Ross was born in 1934 in Donkin Terace, North Shields, and was brought up there by his parents John Ross and Agnes Charlton, learning to play the violin as a teenager. He took a sculpture degree at Kings College Durham (now Newcastle University) from 1952\u201356. At this time he met the Kingsmen Rapper side (becoming their musician after trying the dance) as well as the Northumbrian pipers Forster Charlton and Colin Caisley, falling in love with the Northumbrian smallpipes.Living Tradition, issue 38, 2000.", "In 1958 he was a founder member of the Bridge Folk Club, Newcastle, originally called Newcastle Folksong and Ballad, and there met his future wife, folk singer Ray Fisher. In the same year he got his first set of pipes from Willie Hamilton in Glasgow via Forster Charlton. He made his first set of pipes in 1961 while he was a lecturer at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University), copying his own set. He won several pipemaking competitions through the 1960s, and was elected vice-chairman of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 1964."]}, {"page": "The High Level Ranters", "response": ["At various times and for various recordings Forster Charlton, John Doonan, Pete Wood and Louis Killen have also been band members."]}, {"page": "Foster Charlton", "response": ["#redirect Forster Charlton"]}]}}
