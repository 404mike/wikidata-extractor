Kelly is one of many suspected of being Jack the Ripper. He was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's Jack the Ripper: 100 Years of Investigation (1987), with his case described in more detail in the book Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper (1997), written by Jim Tully. In 2010, Discovery Channel broadcast a documentary called Jack the Ripper in America, in which retired NYPD cold-case detective Ed Norris investigates the case. Norris claims that James Kelly is not only Jack the Ripper's true identity, but that he is also responsible for a number of 'Ripper-like' murders in the United States.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Kelly", "response": ["* James Kelly (pirate) (died 1701), English pirate", "* James Kelly (crimper), 19th-century American criminal", "* James Kelly (Irish Army officer) (1929\u20132003), cleared of attempting to import arms for the IRA in 1970", "* James Kelly (murderer) (1860\u20131929), English murderer and Jack the Ripper suspect", "* James Kelly (abstract expressionist artist) (1913\u20132003), American painter", "* James Kelly, member of Irish metal group Altar of Plagues", "* James Kelly (fiddler), Irish fiddler, member of folk group Patrick Street", "*James Kelly (U.S. representative) (1760\u20131819), for the Federalist Party, Pennsylvania, 1805\u20131809", "*James Kelly (Fianna F\u00e1il politician), Irish Fianna F\u00e1il politician", "*James Kelly (Repeal Association politician) (1808\u20131875), Irish Repeal Association politician", "*James Kelly (Scottish politician) (born 1963), member of the Scottish Parliament", "*James Kelly, MP for the Irish constituency of Limerick City, 1844\u20131847", "*James Kelly (Australian explorer) (1791\u20131859),", "*James Kelly (footballer, born 1865) (1865\u20131932), Scottish football player (Renton FC, Celtic FC, national team) and administrator", "*James Kelly (Lincoln City footballer) (fl. 1892\u201393), Scottish footballer (Lincoln City FC)", "*James Kelly (soccer) (c. 1920s), U.S. soccer player", "*James Kelly (Australian footballer) (born 1983), Australian rules footballer", "*James Kelly (basketball) (born 1993), American basketball player", "* James Kelly (Australian explorer) (1791\u20131859), Australian mariner and explorer", "* James Kelly (journalist) (1809\u20131895), founder of Chicago Tribune", "* James Kelly (bishop) (1832\u20131907), Anglican bishop of Newfoundland and Scotland", "* James Kelly (priest) (1877\u20131939), New Zealand Catholic priest and editor", "* James Kelly (historian) (born 1959), professor of Irish history"]}, {"page": "Jack the Ripper suspects", "response": ["===James Kelly===", "left|60px|James KellyJames Kelly (20 April 1860 \u2013 17 September 1929; no relation to victim Mary Kelly) was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's Jack the Ripper. 100 Years of Investigation (Ward Lock 1987) and documented in Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper, by Jim Tully, in 1997.Tully, Jim,  Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper .", "James Kelly murdered his wife in 1883 by stabbing her in the neck.

After the last of the five canonical Ripper murders in London in November 1888, the police searched for Kelly at what had been his residence prior to his wife's murder, but they were not able to locate him. In 1927, almost forty years after his escape, he unexpectedly turned himself in to officials at the Broadmoor Asylum.

Norris highlights a few features of the Kelly story to support his contention. Norris reported Kelly's Broadmoor Asylum file from before his escape and his eventual return has never been opened since 1927 until Norris was given special permission for access to it, and that the file is the perfect profile match for Jack the Ripper.Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer And a Literary Phenomenon  pp. 194\u2013195"]}, {"page": "Carrie Brown (murder victim)", "response": ["No substantial evidence has proven that Jack the Ripper was responsible and the case remains unsolved. It has been stated by writer Philip Sugden that if the murder was committed by Jack the Ripper, one possible culprit could be George Chapman, a Ripper suspect who moved from London to the US around this time,Sugden, Philip The Complete History of Jack the Ripper although recent research suggests that he only moved to the US after this murder.Vanderlinden, Wolf, \u201cThe New York Affair\u201d Ripper Notes: part one issue 16 (July 2003), part two #17 (January 2004), part three #19 (July 2004 ) Another possibility suggested by writer James Tully is James Kelly, a Ripper suspect who murdered his wife by slashing her throat and was committed to Broadmoor Insane Asylum, which he escaped from just prior to the Ripper murders.
