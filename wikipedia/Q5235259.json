On 19 February 2012, in the fifth round of the FA Cup against Crawley Town, Delap received a straight red card for a sliding tackle on David Hunt. Despite the sending off, Stoke went on to win the game 2\u20130. Stoke later appealed against the decision and Delap's three-match ban was overturned. Delap made a total of 36 appearances in all competitions, six of which came in Stoke's historic Europa League campaign, which saw them reach the round of 32 before being knocked out by Spanish side Valencia. On 1 May 2012, Delap was rewarded with another one-year extension to his contract, which would see him extend his stay at Stoke until the end of the 2012\u201313 season."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 York City F.C. season", "response": ["York were beaten 2\u20131 away to Darlington, in which Chris Carruthers scored a consolation goal in the 87th minute.

This seemed to spring Stoke into life and they were awarded a soft looking penalty just before half-time which Walters put past Rene Gilmartin.
