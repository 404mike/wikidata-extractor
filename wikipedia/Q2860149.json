However, due to a change in his father's circumstances, only his sister continued in further education whilst Archie, at the age of 14, was sent to work.\nAfter returning from Sydney, Australia where Dickens had spent much of World War II, he purchased a house in Acacia Gardens in West Wickham, Kent, and worked in a purpose-built studio in the grounds.\nDickens spent much of the early post-war years drawing pin-ups but in the 1960s and 1970s turned his artistic talents to greeting cards which could be seen in the greeting card shops across the UK at the time \u2014 having adopted the signature 'Gluckli' as the increasingly well-known identifying mark to Dickens' obvious Archie style.\nIn March 2002 Tony Blair, the then British Prime Minister, wore a Paul Smith designer shirt that displayed one of Dickens' paintings on the cuff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of pin-up artists", "response": ["* Archie Dickens"]}, {"page": "Men Only", "response": ["Humour was at the heart of the title, though from the start it carried fiction (including by P.
