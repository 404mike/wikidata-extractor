William Tanui moved forward early and was the next back through the turn followed by Curtis Robb.  Along the backstretch. Williams began a run at Ruto, around Robb followed by Giuseppe D'Urso, Tanui was falling through the field with Billy Konchellah in dead last place, it looked like the Kenyan team strategy was going to blow up.  Coming off the final turn, Williams looked like he had set Ruto up and was going to sprint by, but instead Williams could make no forward progress, his body delaying D'Urso and Ruto again had a 2 meter lead.  D'Urso chased Ruto down the straightaway but couldn't make any progress.  Everybody else in the field sliding further away except Konchellah, still last off the turn but the field tightening, Konchellah moved out to lane 3 to avoid traffic and sprinted past the crowd, chasing D'Urso to the line but not quite getting there in time.
