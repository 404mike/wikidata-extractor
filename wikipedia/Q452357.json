His brother Owen, under the name Owen Paul, had a hit single with a cover of Marshall Crenshaw's You're My Favorite Waste of Time.McGee met future Simple Minds frontman Jim Kerr at Holyrood R.C. Secondary School, and joined him and other friends (guitarist Charlie Burchill and bassist Tony Donald) from the same school in the band Biba-Rom! around the mid-1970s, while still at school. In 1977, they formed the punk band Johnny and the Self Abusers, whose name changed to Simple Minds. He was present on the albums Life in a Day, Real to Real Cacophony, Empires and Dance and Sons and Fascination. In September 1981, he left Simple Minds after having tired of constant touring and life with the band.After working in his parents' pub, he joined Endgames, replacing David Wilde who left to tour with another Glasgow based band, Altered Images. After two albums, the band dissolved in 1985. By that time, he, along with former Simple Minds bandmate Derek Forbes, joined Propaganda, remaining until 1995. In 2009, they both formed the band Ex-Simple Minds.

The other current band members are Ged Grimes (bass guitar),  Cherisse Osei (drums), Sarah Brown (backing vocals), Gordy Goudie (additional guitar & keyboards). Notable former members include Mick MacNeil (keyboards), Derek Forbes (bass), Brian McGee & Mel Gaynor (drums).", "The roots of Simple Minds are in the short-lived punk band Johnny & The Self-Abusers, founded on the South Side of Glasgow in early 1977. The band was conceived (initially as an imaginary band) by would-be Glasgow scene-maker Alan Cairnduff, although he left the job of organising the band to his friend John Milarky. At Cairnduff's suggestion, Milarky teamed up with two musicians he had never worked with before \u2013 budding singer and lyricist Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill. Kerr and Burchill had known each other since the age of eight. After joining Johnny & The Self-Abusers, they brought in two of their school friends, Brian McGee on drums and Tony Donald on bass (all four had previously played together in the schoolboy band Biba-Rom!).", "During this period, the band's visual aesthetic was established, masterminded by Malcolm Garrett's graphic design company Assorted iMaGes. Characterised at first by hard, bold typography and photo-collage, Garrett's designs for the band later incorporated pop-religious iconography in clean, integrated package designs that befitted the band's idealised image as neo-romantic purveyors of European anthemic pop. Drummer Brian McGee left the band at the end of the Sons and Fascination sessions, citing exhaustion at Simple Minds' constant touring schedule, and a desire for more time at home with family. He later joined Propaganda.", "The first casualty was bassist Derek Forbes, who was beginning to squabble with Kerr. Forbes began failing to turn up for rehearsals, and was dismissed. Forbes remained in touch with the band (and soon reunited with another former Simple Minds bandmate, drummer Brian McGee, in Propaganda). Forbes was replaced by former Brand X bass player John Giblin (who owned the band's rehearsal space and was a session musician who had worked with Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush). Giblin made his debut with Simple Minds at Live Aid in Philadelphia, where the band performed \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\", a new track called \"Ghost Dancing\" and \"Promised You a Miracle\". Simple Minds were the first band to be approached to play the Philadelphia leg of Live Aid.", "Good News from the Next World was released in 1995. The album reached No.\u00a02 in the UK and produced the Top 10 hit \"She's a River\" and the Top 20 single \"Hypnotised\". The band toured to promote Good News from the Next World, with Malcolm Foster and Mark Taylor as touring bass and keyboard players and Mark Schulman (who had played on the album) on drums. This was Foster's last work with the band, and Schulman returned to session work at the end of the tour. After being released from their contract with Virgin Records, Simple Minds made use of the skills of their original rhythm section, Derek Forbes and Brian McGee (returning after respective eleven- and fourteen-year absences). Although McGee was not involved beyond the rehearsal stage, Forbes formally rejoined Simple Minds in July 1996. The band then reunited with Mel Gaynor for a studio session in early 1997. Gaynor was reinstated as a full-time member for the European tour (which once again featured Mark Taylor on keyboards).", "In June 2008, Kerr and Burchill briefly reunited with the full original band lineup for the first time in twenty-seven years, when meetings with Derek Forbes, Mick MacNeil and Brian McGee led to a studio rehearsal date.

In the meantime a remix album, Wishful Thinking, was released in November 1985. Originally intended for the American club market, the album was also released in Europe, but against the wishes of the group themselves. The album peaked at number 82 in the UK. A remixed version of \"p:Machinery\" was also re-released as a single, only four months after its original release. In the UK, it too failed to make an impact and peaked at number 83, but was, again, more successful in France and Germany.", "In 1988, the band (initially still including Ralf D\u00f6rper and Susanne Freytag) signed to Virgin Records, and began recording new material.

The result was a new album, released in 1990 called 1234, produced by former Tears For Fears' associates Ian Stanley and Chris Hughes, Miller's future husband.
