He was educated at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. In addition to his nine published travelogues to date, his writings have appeared in various publications including Esquire, The Sunday Times, The Independent, The Observer and the Evening Standard.  He was also briefly a journalist for the Teletext computer games magazine Digitiser, under the pseudonym Mr Hairs, alongside Mr Biffo (aka comedy and sitcom writer Paul Rose.)\nHis book Frost On My Moustache is an account of a journey in which the author attempts to emulate Lord Dufferin's fearless spirit and enthusiastic adventuring, but comes to identify far more with Dufferin's permanently miserable butler, Wilson, as portrayed in Dufferin's travel book Letters From High Latitudes. The book title refers to a joke Moore retells to his Scandinavian shipmates:  \"An Eskimo calls out a repair man to check his car. The mechanic checks under the bonnet and then offers a diagnosis: \"Looks like you've blown a seal, mate.\" \"No,\" says the driver, nervously fingering his upper lip, \"it's just frost on my moustache.\"\"In 2004, Moore presented an ITV programme based on his book Do Not Pass Go, a travelogue of his journey around the locations that appear on a British Monopoly board.\nIn 2014, Moore released his 9th book, Gironimo! Riding the Very Terrible 1914 Tour of Italy, which recounts his 2012 recreation of the difficult 1914 Giro d'Italia. For the recreation he used a period bicycle and wore a reproduction period costume. The book was featured as Book of the Week on BBC Radio 4 in May 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Babylon Zoo", "response": ["Tim Moore wrote that \"only failure and embarrassment\" followed for Babylon Zoo. An album entitled The Boy with the X-Ray Eyes was produced at Mann's New Atlantis Productions music and video center. It peaked at number 6 on the UK Albums Chart on 17 February, but quickly dropped out of the Top 40, lasting only a further two weeks on the chart. Subsequent singles charted progressively lower, failing to match the success of \"Spaceman\". The band's reputation was further damaged by a series of scathing live reviews."]}, {"page": "Digitiser", "response": ["Digitiser was created by writers Paul Rose and Tim Moore who went by the pseudonyms Mr Biffo and Mr Hairs.

Hairs was fired by Teletext in May 1996, and Biffo continued to write the bulk of the magazine solo, apart for occasional, part-time contributors, who helped him out with the letters, tips, and charts pages.", "Gossi the Dog - Perhaps Digitisers most controversial character, Gossi hosted a regular gaming gossip page. On one occasion, the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint about the Gossi page, which alluded to Gossi's master thrashing the talking cartoon dog with a belt. Gossi's page also led to the dismissal of Tim Moore, who - while Rose was away on paternity leave - printed an unsubstantiated rumour about a fellow games journalist Dave Perry.  Teletext's editors allegedly used the absence of Rose (who remained useful to the company for his graphic design abilities), and the journalist's complaint, as an excuse to fire Moore."]}, {"page": "Thomas Coryat", "response": ["British travel writer and humorist Tim Moore retraced the steps of Coryat's tour of Europe, as recounted in his book Continental Drifter (2000).

Several authors who have written about the board game have noted many of the \"house rules\" that have become common among players, although they do not appear in Parker Brothers' rules sheets.

AllMusic.] Writer Tim Moore and a Scotsman journalist likened the song to a dirge, and unfavourably compared it to the Arthur Baker (Zupervarian) remix ; Moore attributed the single's success to the Baker (Zupervarian) remix and its Levi's advert exposure. Steven Wells of NME recalled: \"Millions of pop kids rushed down Woolies and bought the single \u2013 only to get it home to discover to their horror that it was 'good' (like in the advert) for about ten seconds, and then became rubbish.

The lyrics are heavily based on actual experiences of flying. The song contains a liberal amount of sexual innuendo, the most overt being \"...and blow into the mouthpiece\" and \"would you like something to suck on for landing, sir?\" (the latter was omitted or changed for some tea-time television performances).

Sinclair Users John Cook stated that the title's fast-paced action made it worth playing, but noted that it offered nothing original. Gamests five reviewers regarded it to be a cohesive game as a whole, finding its low difficulty to be accessible but unsatisfactory when compared to more difficult shooters like Dogyuun and felt mixed regarding the graphics, as well as expressing doubt if people would play it for the brand recognition. Digitisers Paul Rose and Tim Moore wrote that it was fun despite the lack of originality and found its gameplay to be decent. However, Rose and Moore criticized its \"leathery\" graphics when compared with titles like Axelay and Thunder Force IV. "]}]}}
