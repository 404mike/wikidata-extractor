He was a notable campaigner for New Zealand self-government, and is generally regarded as having been the country's first premier (an office that would later be titled \"Prime Minister\"), having led the Sewell Ministry in 1856. He later served as Colonial Treasurer (1856\u201359), as Attorney-General (1861\u201362), and twice as Minister of Justice (1864\u201365, 1869\u201372).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isle of Wight", "response": ["* New Zealand PM Henry Sewell"]}, {"page": "September 7", "response": ["*1807 \u2013 Henry Sewell, English lawyer and politician, 1st Prime Minister of New Zealand (d. 1879)"]}, {"page": "1807", "response": ["* September 7 \u2013 Henry Sewell, 1st Premier of New Zealand (d. 1879)"]}, {"page": "1879", "response": ["** Henry Sewell, New Zealand politician, 1st Premier of New Zealand (b. 1807)"]}, {"page": "Prime Minister of New Zealand", "response": ["Assuming that Henry Sewell is counted as the first prime minister, 40 individuals have held the office since it was established. Some of these people have held it on several occasions, with the record for maximum number of times being shared between William Fox and Harry Atkinson (both of whom served four times). The longest that anyone has served in the office is 13 years, a record set by Richard Seddon. The first holder of the office, Henry Sewell, led the country for the shortest total time; his only term lasted just 13 days. The shortest term belonged to Harry Atkinson, whose third term lasted only seven days, but Atkinson served longer in total than did Sewell. The youngest was Edward Stafford, who was appointed premier in 1856, at 37 years, 40 days old. The oldest was Walter Nash, who was 78 years old when he left office in 1960 (and 75 upon taking office in 1957).", "The first person to be formally appointed to a position of executive leadership was Henry Sewell, who formed a brief ministry in April 1856, at the beginning of the Second Parliament. Despite his formal leadership role, however, his only actual title was \"colonial secretary\", a position comparable to a minister of internal affairs. His successor, William Fox, was also given a formal leadership role, but was not colonial secretary. When Frederick Weld became the sixth person appointed to formal leadership, a substantive leadership title, \"premier\", appeared. Weld's successor, Edward Stafford, briefly changed the title to \"first minister\", but it was soon restored to premier during the second tenure of Fox. From that point, the title \"premier\" was used almost exclusively for the remainder of the 19th century. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the Civil List of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the head of government, referred to as the \"Prime Minister\"."]}, {"page": "Edward Gibbon Wakefield", "response": ["The ship arrived at Port Lyttelton on 2 February 1853. Wakefield had travelled with Henry Sewell who had been deputy chairman and full-time manager of the Canterbury Association. It seems likely that he expected to be welcomed as a founding father of the colony; to be feted and immediately asked to assume the leadership of colony. However, colonisation had inevitably changed the perspectives of the people of Canterbury. Many of them felt they had been let down and cheated by the Association, and the two arrivals were firmly linked in their minds with the broken promises and disappointments of the Association."]}, {"page": "Minister of Finance (New Zealand)", "response": ["| Henry Sewell", "| Henry Sewell"]}, {"page": "William Fox (politician)", "response": ["Before returning to New Zealand, Fox and his wife spent some time travelling in Canada, the United States, and Cuba. When they returned to New Zealand, the new constitution was in effect, and elections had already been held. In 1855 Fox was elected MP for Wanganui. He fought on a strong platform of provincial autonomy, and was particularly opposed to the government formed the following year by Henry Sewell, who took the newly created office of Premier of New Zealand. Fox managed to oust Sewell from the new post in only 13 days,  becoming New Zealand's second Premier. Fox, however, lasted only 13 days himself before being ousted by Edward Stafford. Fox spent the first years of Stafford's premiership in semi-retirement, but later returned to be Stafford's primary opponent in parliament."]}, {"page": "Edward Stafford (politician)", "response": ["When the New Zealand Parliament was opened, however, Stafford did not seek election, claiming that it was inappropriate to enter national politics while still holding provincial office.

The area set aside for the college in Cathedral Square, 3 acres 1 rood and 3 perches (), was found to be insufficient. In a meeting in June 1853 between Henry Sewell, Henry Jacobs, Rev. Robert Bateman Paul, and Thomas Cass, Sewell took the group for a visit of a site earmarked as the Government Domain (i.e. botanical gardens). The group agreed on the site, subject to approval by Bishop Selwyn, which was later obtained. Years later, this land transaction was formalised through The Cathedral Square Ordinance 1858, a law passed by the Canterbury Provincial Council in October 1858. The compensation paid for the transfer of land to the Provincial Council was \u00a31,200, but with , the college was also given a much larger piece of land."]}, {"page": "Timeline of New Zealand history", "response": ["* Henry Sewell forms first ministry under responsible government and becomes first Premier."]}, {"page": "1st New Zealand Parliament", "response": ["The 1st Parliament was held before the creation of either political parties or the office of Premier. There were, however, appointments made to the Executive Council (the formal institution upon which Cabinet is based). From 14 June 1854 to 2 August 1854, there was a four-person cabinet, New Zealand's first ministry, led by James FitzGerald, with Henry Sewell, Frederick Weld, and Thomas Bartley (a fifth member, Dillon Bell, also joined for a short time). Then, from 31 August 1854 to 2 September 1854, there was another four-person cabinet led by Thomas Forsaith, with James Macandrew, William Travers, and Jerningham Wakefield. Some historians consider FitzGerald and Forsaith to be New Zealand's first Prime Ministers, but neither held any formal leadership role and since \"responsible government\" had not yet been obtained, they had little real power. Henry Sewell, appointed shortly after the 2nd New Zealand Parliament opened, is more often considered to have been the first Prime Minister."]}, {"page": "Dillon Bell", "response": ["In the 1855 election, Bell stood for the lower house in the Hutt electorate, and was successful. When Henry Sewell became New Zealand's first Premier and formed the Sewell Ministry, Bell was appointed Colonial Treasurer on 7 May 1856 (the office from which the modern post of Minister of Finance is descended). Sewell's premiership lasted only two weeks, however, and Bell lost his position.

He is remembered for the incident with Henry Sewell in Parliament in 1854.", "With the standing orders overturned, Wynyard's message could remain officially \"unopened\" while Parliament continued to function. Mackay, part of the minority who supported Wynyard, attempted to bypass this tactic by presenting a copy of The New Zealand Gazette which contained the prorogation order, shouting \"you are no House, you are prorogued!\". He then attempted to disrupt the business of Parliament until Henry Sewell (later to become New Zealand's first Premier) and another MP attempted to manhandle him out of the debating chamber. Mackay managed to escape, and (in the words of a contemporary) \"beat an honourable retreat over the rail into the stranger's gallery, waving defiance to his assailants with his trusty umbrella.\" Mackay was later found guilty of \"gross and premeditated contempt of the House\"."]}, {"page": "Thomas Forsaith", "response": ["When Browne arrived, he announced that self-government would begin with the 2nd New Zealand Parliament.

Despite his election to Parliament, he chose to retain the Superintendency of Canterbury, a decision criticised by some. In Parliament, FitzGerald argued strongly in favour of \"responsible government\" once again, attempting to make New Zealand's executive responsible to Parliament rather than the Governor. The acting Governor, Robert Wynyard, eventually agreed to appoint FitzGerald, Henry Sewell, Frederick Weld, and Thomas Bartley to the Executive Council. They were later joined briefly by Dillon Bell, a member of the Legislative Council.", "Later, when the 2nd New Zealand Parliament managed to obtain the power that had eluded the 1st, FitzGerald was too ill to attend. Instead, Henry Sewell (one of FitzGerald's colleagues in the first attempted cabinet) was asked to form a government. In 1857, FitzGerald resigned from Parliament on the advice of his doctors, and also decided not to seek re-election as provincial superintendent. Instead, he left Lyttelton on 30 September on the James Gibson for Sydney and returned to England, where he resumed his work for the Canterbury Association. During his time in England, he was offered governorships of both British Columbia and Queensland, but his ill health prevented him from accepting."]}]}}
