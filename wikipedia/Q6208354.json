Their top scorer was Scottish forward Joe Anderson, with 31\u00a0competitive goals, including 25 in the league. Eight new players were signed by Burnley during the course of the season, and nine were released. Match attendances were the highest they had ever been at Turf Moor, with an average gate of over 30,000. The highest attendance of the campaign was a crowd of 42,653, who saw Burnley beat Bolton Wanderers 3\u20131 on 26\u00a0February 1921; the lowest was 22,000, for the match against Sunderland on the final day of the season.", "Burnley's league campaign began on 28\u00a0August 1920 with a home match against Bradford City, who had finished 15th in the league in 1919\u201320. The season began inauspiciously for Burnley, beaten 1\u20134, but the match did see eventual top scorer Joe Anderson score the first of his 25\u00a0league goals of the campaign. Two further away defeats followed, 0\u20131 at Huddersfield Town and 0\u20132 at Bradford City, leaving Burnley at the bottom of the league table.Simpson (2007), p. 152 This run of defeats was Burnley's worst start to a league season since 1906\u201307, when they also lost their opening three matches.Simpson (2007), p. 14 Manager Haworth subsequently made several changes to the team; goalkeeper Jerry Dawson and defender Tommy Boyle were reinstated, while Bert Freeman and James Lindsay were dropped in favour of Billy Nesbitt and Benny Cross respectively. Burnley picked up their first win on 6\u00a0September 1920, beating Huddersfield Town 3\u20130 at Turf Moor; the goalscorers were Bob Kelly, Tommy Boyle, and Billy Nesbitt. They went on to defeat Middlesbrough 2\u20131 at home, and to draw with them 0\u20130 at Ayresome Park. On 25\u00a0September 1920, four players scored in a 4\u20130 victory against a weakened Chelsea team, giving Burnley their third successive home win.", "A win and a draw against Liverpool, followed by a 2\u20130 victory over Preston North End, took Burnley into the Christmas period three points clear at the top of the league. The convincing 6\u20130 win over Sheffield United on Christmas Day, in which forward Joe Anderson scored four times, set a new club record unbeaten streak of 17\u00a0games, beating the record set during the 1897\u201398 campaign.Simpson (2007), p. 68 Burnley continued their good form into 1921, beating Preston North End away before achieving two victories against local rivals Blackburn Rovers. The first of these wins, a 4\u20131 success, was watched by 41,534\u00a0spectators, the biggest home crowd of the season until then. The victory was followed by a 3\u20131 away win a week later. On 5\u00a0February 1921, Anderson scored five goals in a \"brilliant\" performance against Aston Villa as Burnley recorded their second 7\u20131 win of the season.

A new league unbeaten record was set with a 0\u20130 draw with Aston Villa four days later.Simpson (2007), p. 151 Despite losing George Halley to an illness which forced him to miss the remainder of the season, Burnley secured a late home win over Derby County in the following game, sending Derby to the bottom of the league table. February ended with a 3\u20131 victory against Bolton Wanderers in front of a crowd of 42,653, the largest league attendance ever at Turf Moor at the time. The team took four points from the next three matches. Burnley firstly drew 1\u20131 away against a Bolton Wanderers team who were unbeaten at home, before a then-record crowd of 54,609 at Burnden Park, before beating Arsenal at Turf Moor. The following week Burnley secured an away draw at Arsenal, despite their opponents attacking for much of the game.", "Burnley's first match outside the league in the 1920\u201321 season was a friendly on 22\u00a0September 1920 against a Blackburn Rovers XI to mark the opening of Accrington Stanley's new stadium at Peel Park. Burnley won the game 10\u20131 with seven goals from Joe Anderson in addition to strikes from James Lindsay, Walter Weaver and Thomas Jackson. Burnley's opening game in the FA Cup was an away tie at Leicester City on 8 January 1921. Bob Kelly scored for the fourth game in succession and Joe Anderson scored four goals as Burnley won the match 7\u20133, the first time the team had scored seven goals in a competitive match away from home. After the match, the Athletic News described Burnley as the best team in the country.", "Following the win over Leicester City, Burnley were drawn against Queens Park Rangers at Turf Moor in the Second Round. Despite a good performance by their opponents, Burnley progressed to the Third Round with a 4\u20132 win, in which Bob Kelly struck twice in the first half and Joe Anderson scored either side of half time. In the Third Round, Burnley were handed an away tie at Hull City, who at the time were struggling in the Football League Second Division and had won only two matches in the previous five months. Despite being without first-team regulars George Halley and Joe Anderson through injury, Burnley were expected to win comfortably, not having lost since 4\u00a0September 1920. Hull City played above all expectations and Burnley suffered a 0\u20133 defeat after being 0\u20131 behind at half time.", "In April 1921, Burnley won the East Lancs Charity Cup for the second consecutive season, beating Blackburn Rovers 8\u20132 on aggregate over two legs. The first leg was won 6\u20132 at Turf Moor thanks to goals from Eddie Mosscrop, Joe Anderson, Benny Cross and a hat-trick from Bob Kelly, before strikes from Joe Anderson and James Lindsay gave Burnley a 2\u20130 win at Ewood Park. This success was followed by a 2\u20131 friendly victory over a Scottish Football League XI in a benefit match for Celtic winger Patsy Gallacher. Burnley also participated in the Lancashire Senior Cup; the league matches against Blackburn Rovers and Preston North End also counted as group stage matches in the competition. The team won all four of these games to qualify for the semi-finals, where they were drawn against Manchester City.
