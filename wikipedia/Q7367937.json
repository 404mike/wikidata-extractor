Hangman's reached the top 5 in the UK album charts soon after its release in March 1968 and was nominated for a Grammy in the US. Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin said his group found their way by playing Hangman's and following the instructions.\"Retying the Knot\", 1997 BBC documentary on ISB A departure from the band's previous albums, the set relied heavily on a more layered production, with imaginative use of the then new multitrack recording techniques. The album featured a series of vividly dreamlike Williamson songs, such as \"The Minotaur's Song\", a surreal music-hall parody told from the point of view of the mythical beast, and its centrepiece was Heron's \"A Very Cellular Song\", a 13-minute reflection on life, love and amoebas, its complex structure incorporating a Bahamian spiritual (\"I Bid You Goodnight\"). Williamson and Heron in this album had added their girlfriends, Licorice McKechnie and Rose Simpson, to the band to contribute additional vocals and various instruments, including organ, guitar and percussion. Despite their initially rudimentary skills, Simpson swiftly became a proficient bass guitarist, and some of McKechnie's songs were recorded by the band.", "The band continued to tour and record. Rose Simpson left in 1971 and was replaced by Malcolm Le Maistre, formerly of the Stone Monkey troupe. Mike Heron took time out to record a well-received solo album, Smiling Men with Bad Reputations, which, in contrast to the ISB's self-contained productions, featured a host of session guests, among them Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Keith Moon, John Cale and Richard Thompson. The following year, Licorice left, and was replaced by Gerard Dott, an Edinburgh jazz musician and friend of both Heron and Williamson who had contributed to Smiling Men. Williamson also recorded a solo album, Myrrh, which featured some of his most extraordinary vocal performances.", "In 1994 Rose Simpson, a former member of the band, became Mayoress of Aberystwyth.

Heron wrote two tracks while Williamson penned four on the album, but, in the first occurrence featured on an ISB album, the two had joint credits on the song, \"Dust Be Diamonds\". The two, despite being bandmates, typically composed whole tracks individually, so as to maintain their own separate musical identity.
