By the early twentieth-first century the widespread use of digital media, which seemed to empower people, rejuvenated the idea that individual preferences drove audience behavior. In \u201cThe duality of media,\u201d Webster adapted structuration theory to argue that macro-level structural factors were still critical in shaping patterns of public attention to digital media. In 2012, the \"duality\" article won the Denis McQuail Award for best article advancing communication theory. The fullest expression of his theory of audience behavior is in The Marketplace of Attention, which won the 2015 Robert G. Picard Book Award."]}]}}
