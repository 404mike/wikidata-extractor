As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: \"I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done\".Letter to Dorothy Wellesley, 17 June 1935; cited Ellmann, \"Yeats's Second Puberty\", The New York Review of Books, 9 May 1985 In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892\u20131935.
