Santiniketan offered an advantage \u2013 there were people ready to assist and support. He studied the translations of Helene Meyer-Franck and Alokeranjan Dasgupta, both of whom had translated Tagore from Bengali to German. There was Ketaki Kushari Dyson, poet, novelist and translator (Bengali to English), whose comment that nobody who is not a poet is able to translate Rabindranath's poems competently had somewhat disturbed K\u00e4mpchen. The publication of Selected Poems of Rabindranath Tagore, translated from Bengali to English by William Radice inspired him."]}]}}
