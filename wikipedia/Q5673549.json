Torquay substitute Danny Stevens gave the home side the lead just a minute after half-time. Stevenage captain Mark Roberts was given a straight red card with twenty minutes remaining for bringing down Chris Zebroski in the area, with the latter missing the subsequent penalty. Torquay doubled their lead with five minutes remaining through Jake Robinson. This was followed up with another defeat three days later, this time a 1\u20130 loss to Hereford United at Broadhall Way. Four days later, on 12 March, Stevenage beat Wycombe Wanderers 1\u20130 at Adams Park. John Mousinho scored the only goal of the game just after half-time, scoring against his former club with a goal from 30 yards out. Stevenage had to play with ten men for the last thirty minutes of the match after Scott Laird was sent-off for two bookable offences. Another away victory followed three days later as Stevenage beat Oxford United 2\u20131 at the Kassam Stadium. Stevenage took the lead midway through the first half when Harry Worley deflected Darius Charles' header into his own goal. Oxford equalised in first-half injury-time, Tom Craddock scoring from the penalty spot after Peter Winn was adjudged to have fouled Josh Payne in the area. Just three minutes after half-time, Stevenage striker Craig Reid scored his first goal for the club after good work from Rob Sinclair \u2013 the goal gave the visitors their fifth win in their last seven outings. Stevenage secured their third consecutive victory with a 2\u20131 home win against Lincoln City on 19 March 2011. Lincoln striker Ashley Grimes scored from the penalty spot after Scott Laird had handled in the area. The home side equalised four minutes later, John Mousinho's shot was saved by Lincoln goalkeeper Trevor Carson, but Lawrie Wilson was on hand to score the rebound. Wilson doubled his goal tally for the day on the hour mark, lashing a shot past Carson from 25 yards after a neat interchange with Mousinho. A fourth straight win followed three days later, with two John Mousinho goals securing a 2\u20130 victory against Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium. Stevenage secured their fifth straight victory four days later, comprehensively beating Macclesfield Town 4\u20130 at Moss Rose.

This game was selected as one of the Football League's \"anniversary fixtures\" to mark the 125th anniversary of the first Football League season. With Harry Worley scoring the historic first League goal, a brace from Chris Zebroski and a goal from Christian Jolley 10 minutes into the second half, County won 4\u20131 and were top of the League Two table. In the next game away to Northampton, Conor Washington scored his first League goal but the club suffered a 3\u20131 loss. The next home game, the Severnside derby with Bristol Rovers saw County's highest gate of the season; Andy Sandell's first-half penalty being enough to take all three points. The next three games were all drawn 1\u20131 with County slipping out of the play-off places as a result. The next home game, against Morecambe, will forever be remembered as the \"Tom Naylor game\": Scoring within three minutes, Billy Jones had made the perfect start to his d\u00e9but game before Naylor scored an own goal to level the match. Robbie Willmott restored Newport's lead before Naylor's second own goal again levelled things. With 20 minutes remaining Naylor conceded a penalty which allowed Morecambe to take the lead and eventually win the game. County's first away win of the season in the next game at Exeter, followed by a home win to Torquay United took County back to the brink of the play-off positions, but following the next two games they were back down to 12th. County then embarked on a successful spell, losing only once at Fleetwood until visiting Burton Albion in the last game of 2013. That last game was lost 1\u20130, but County finished the year in a play-off position.", "|22||DF||align=\"left\"| Harry Worley||26 (0)||4||3 (0)||0||2 (0)||0||2 (0)||0||33 (0)||4", "|20 June 2013||DF|| Harry Worley||Oxford United||Free", "|5 May 2014||DF|| Harry Worley||Released||"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Harry Worley", "|DF|| Harry Worley|| Newport County||Free||7 June 2014||"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 8 June 2015 || DF || Harry Worley || Stevenage || Free || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2015 || CB ||  || Harry Worley || Hartlepool United  || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 5 August 2016 || DF || Harry Worley || Salford City || Free || "]}]}}
