On 22 May 1981, he was found guilty of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980.:\u200a144\u200a He was sentenced to 20 concurrent sentences of life imprisonment, which were converted to a whole life order in 2010. Two of Sutcliffe's murders took place in Manchester; all the others were in West Yorkshire.\nSutcliffe initially attacked women and girls in residential areas, but appears to have shifted his focus to red-light districts because he was attracted by the vulnerability of prostitutes. He had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford. After his arrest in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police for driving with false number plates in January 1981, Sutcliffe was transferred to West Yorkshire Police, which questioned him about the killings. He confessed to being the perpetrator, saying that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes. At his trial, Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of diminished responsibility, but he was convicted of murder on a majority verdict. Following his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother's maiden name of Coonan.\nThe search for Sutcliffe was one of the largest and most expensive manhunts in British history, and West Yorkshire Police was criticised for its failure to catch him despite having interviewed him nine times in the course of its five-year investigation. Owing to the sensational nature of the case, the police handled an exceptional amount of information, some of it misleading (including the Wearside Jack hoax recorded message and letters purporting to be from the \"Ripper\"). Following Sutcliffe's conviction, the government ordered a review of the investigation, conducted by the Inspector of Constabulary Lawrence Byford, known as the \"Byford Report\". The findings were made fully public in 2006, and confirmed the validity of the criticism against the force. The report led to changes to investigative procedures that were adopted across UK police forces. In 2019, The Guardian described the manhunt as \"stunningly mishandled\".Sutcliffe was transferred from prison to Broadmoor Hospital in March 1984 after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The High Court dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a whole life order and never be released from custody. In August 2016, it was ruled that Sutcliffe was mentally fit to be returned to prison, and he was transferred that month to HM Prison Frankland in Durham. He died from COVID-19-related complications in hospital while in prison custody on 13 November 2020, at the age of 74.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isle of Wight", "response": ["The Isle of Wight is near the densely populated south of England, yet separated from the mainland. This position led to it hosting three prisons: Albany, Camp Hill and Parkhurst, all located outside Newport near the main road to Cowes. Albany and Parkhurst were among the few Category A prisons in the UK until they were downgraded in the 1990s. The downgrading of Parkhurst was precipitated by a major escape: three prisoners (two murderers and a blackmailer) escaped from the prison on 3 January 1995 for four days, before being recaptured. Parkhurst enjoyed notoriety as one of the toughest jails in the United Kingdom, and housed many notable inmates including the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, New Zealand drug lord Terry Clark and the Kray twins."]}, {"page": "January 2", "response": ["*1981 \u2013 One of the largest investigations by a British police force ends when serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, the \"Yorkshire Ripper\", is arrested in Sheffield, South Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "June 2", "response": ["*  1946   \u2013 Peter Sutcliffe, English serial killer (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "November 13", "response": ["*2020 \u2013 Peter Sutcliffe, English serial killer (b. 1946)"]}, {"page": "1946", "response": ["** Peter Sutcliffe, English serial killer (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "1975", "response": ["** Peter Sutcliffe (the \"Yorkshire Ripper\") commits his first murder, that of Wilma McCann."]}, {"page": "1981", "response": ["* May 22 \u2013 Serial killer Peter Sutcliffe is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on 13 counts of murder and 7 of attempted murder in England."]}, {"page": "From Hell", "response": ["Gull is tried by a secret Masonic council, which determines he is insane.

The Craven murder remains unsolved, but rumours that Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, was responsible for his murder resurfaced in 2017.
