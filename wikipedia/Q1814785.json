Described in his obituary in The Times as \"arguably Britain's most talented post-war all-round amateur sportsman\" Norman Borrett was a pupil and later a schoolmaster at Framlingham College. The story of Norman Borrett can be found in the book Master Sportsman by Richard Sayer. This book is dedicated to Norman's widow, Mullie.\nHe captained England 11 times in his 30 hockey internationals and at the 1948 Summer Olympics he captained the Great Britain field hockey team, which won the silver medal, playing in all five matches as inside-left and scoring 10 goals.He won the British Amateur Squash Championship in the first five years after the war, from 1946 to 1950, not losing a set in any of the finals. He played 11 times for England at squash, and captained in most of them. He played cricket for Essex three times (1939 and 1946) and for Devon 50 times from 1947 to 1950. He once qualified for Wimbledon too, but didn't have time to compete in it.\nHe was born in Wanstead, London, and died in Colchester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Field hockey at the 1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["In five Olympic hockey tournaments, there had only been two different winners, but Britain and India had never competed together at the Olympics. In fact, the two nations had never played each other, the British fearing embarrassment as their (former) colony was considered the better team. There was no question the UK would again be absent at their home Olympics, although there were some organizational difficulties. First of all, the four British nations were independently affiliated with the international federation FIH and were not very keen on cooperating. Also, there were no hockey grounds to train on, as these were used by cricketers during the summer. Still, they managed to put together a team, the first real British hockey team at the Olympics (the 1908 and 1920 champions had been composed entirely of English players). Their captain was the versatile Norman Borrett, a first-class cricketer and national squash champion who once qualified for Wimbledon but didn't have time to compete.", "| width=150 | Robert AdlardNorman BorrettDavid BrodieRonald DavisW O GreeneWilliam GriffithsE J E HitchmanFrederick LindsayWilliam LindsayJohn PeakeFrank ReynoldsGeorge Sime (c)D B ThomasMichael WalfordP WhitbreadWilliam WhiteA H Young"]}, {"page": "Framlingham College", "response": ["*Norman Borrett,The Times: Norman Borrett | The Times, accessdate: February 8, 2016 Schoolmaster and accomplished sportsman.
