When the Royal British Legion announced it was setting up an inquiry into Kiszely's behaviour, he resigned, admitting that he had made \"exaggerated and foolish claims\" and therefore it would be \"inappropriate\" for him to keep his role at the legion. However, he claimed that he had not broken Whitehall rules. Defence secretary Philip Hammond said that the allegations against Kiszely and others are damaging and that he may restrict the access that former officers have to current staff. \"If they're abusing that access for commercial purposes then we will have to tighten it up or maybe even shut it down,\" he said. However, he argued that former military officers did not have influence on how the Ministry of Defence spends taxpayers' money. The Ministry of Defence said it would investigate whether Kiszely and other former generals implicated by the investigation had broken any rules and if so, what punishment was appropriate."]}, {"page": "List of Old Marlburians", "response": ["* Ian Macfadyen, RAF officer and Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man 2000\u20132005"]}, {"page": "MacFadyen", "response": ["* Ian Macfadyen, (born 1942), British retired Air Marshal"]}, {"page": "Douglas Macfadyen", "response": ["His son, Sir Ian Macfadyen, also became an air marshal.The International Who's Who 2004 By Europa Publications, p. 1053"]}]}}
