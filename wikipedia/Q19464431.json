Of the marriage were born twenty-two children, only six of whom survived past infancy. Two, Thomas Anthony Devis (1757\u20131810) and Arthur William Devis (1762\u20131822), became painters. One daughter, Ellin Devis (1746-1820), was a schoolmistress and author of the popular grammar The Accidence (1775).

C. Edwards, Mrs. Eves, Ellenor Fenn (aka Mrs. Teachwell and Mrs. Lovechild), Ann Fisher, Jane Gardiner n\u00e9e Arden, Blanche Mercy, and Mrs. Taylor. They \"together published a total of twelve discrete grammars, with over one hundred documented editions appearing well into the nineteenth century\". The study of English grammar was seen as important in learning how to write English well, and in learning other languages later. It held a strong significance to many people in the United States with little to no income, and sparse educational backgrounds, ranging from former slaves, to rail splitters or weavers. Learning it permitted individuals like these to speak and write the language with passionate fluency, helping them expand on their careers.", "*1775.  Ellin Devis: The Accidence"]}]}}
