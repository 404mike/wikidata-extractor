In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, or French monarchy. This was the Age of Enlightenment, when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the \"Dark Ages\". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the \"Dark Ages\" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain.Robert Bartlett. \"Perspectives on the Medieval World\" in Medieval Panorama, 2001,  For them \"feudalism\" meant seigneurial privileges and prerogatives. When the French Constituent Assembly abolished the \"feudal regime\" in August 1789, this is what was meant."]}, {"page": "Western Europe", "response": ["* The Making of Europe, , by Robert Bartlett"]}, {"page": "David I of Scotland", "response": ["Henry I had arranged his inheritance to pass to his daughter Empress Matilda.

The central idea is that from the late 10th century onwards the culture and institutions of the old Carolingian heartlands in northern France and western Germany were spreading to outlying areas, creating a more recognisable \"Europe\". Scotland was just one of many \"outlying\" areas.Bartlett, The Making of Europe, pp. 24\u201359; Moore, The First European Revolution, c.970\u20131215, p. 30ff; see also Barrow, \"The Balance of New and Old\", passim, esp. 9; this idea of \"Europe\" seems in practice to mean \"Western Europe\"."]}, {"page": "University of St Andrews", "response": ["*Robert Bartlett"]}, {"page": "Battle of the Standard", "response": ["Henry I had wished his inheritance to pass to his daughter Matilda, and in 1127 made his notables swear an oath to uphold the succession of Matilda (David was the first layman to do so).

Attempts by Scandinavian, German, Polish, and Bohemian missionaries of pagan conversion to Latin Christianity failed before the late twelfth century, when crusaders from Sweden, Gotland and Saxony conquered most of Latvia and Estonia. The Livonian Brothers of the Sword military order provided a permanent occupation force while the crusaders wintered at home. Defeats at Saule in 1236 and at Lake Peipus in 1242 halted the order's expansion into Lithuania and Russia.  From 1237, Pope Gregory\u00a0IX began absorbing the Sword Brothers into the Teutonic Order. Founded in Palestine as a hospital order after the Siege of Acre in the 1190s, the Teutonic Knights were reorganised as a military order. Historian Robert Bartlett defines the conquest and organisation of power in the Baltic as part of a general movement for 'the expansion of Latin Christendom'. It was made possible by the crusading ideology placing the full machinery of the Church behind superior military technology. It enabled the recruitment of troops by preaching the offer of spiritual rewards for combatants and the administrative machinery to establish a government in the conquered territories.
