Born in Manchester, he played for Goslings before joining the now-famous Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (MUJAC). He made his debut for Manchester United in 1952, but struggled to nail down a regular place in the starting XI and was sold to Preston North End in 1955.\nA year later, he transferred to West Ham United, with Frank O'Farrell moving in the opposite direction. In 1958, he was part of the West Ham team that finished on top of the Second Division before joining Leyton Orient. At Leyton Orient, Lewis was converted from his former position at centre-forward to become the team's regular left-back, and he was part of the team that was promoted to the First Division in 1962 and relegated just a year later. In May 1964, Lewis joined Folkestone Town, before embarking on a short managerial career with Clapton and Ford Sports.\nIn 1970, Lewis emigrated to South Africa, where he was involved in coaching several sides, including Wits University, Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows. He also worked as an analyst for SuperSport. He contracted cancer in his later years and died in May 2011.

He would then miss over a month of football after treatment for a nosebleed which caused him to lose around four pints of blood (he experienced a recurrence of the problem in the following season). His first season with Preston brought a third-place finish and he was still with the Lancashire club when they finished runners-up to Wolverhampton Wanderers in Division One at the end of the 1957\u201358 season.
