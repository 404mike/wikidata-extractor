Boyle was excited by its potential to be the \"most energetic film you've ever seen \u2013 about something that ultimately ends up in purgatory or worse\". Hodge read it and made it his goal to \"produce a screenplay which would seem to have a beginning, a middle and an end, would last 90 minutes and would convey at least some of the spirit and the content of the book\". Boyle convinced Welsh to let them option the rights to his book by writing him a letter stating that Hodge and Macdonald were \"the two most important Scotsmen since Kenny Dalglish and Alex Ferguson\". Welsh remembered that originally the people wanting to option his book \"wanted to make a po-faced piece of social realism like Christiane F or The Basketball Diaries\". He was impressed that Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald wanted everyone to see the film and \"not just the arthouse audience\". In October 1994, Hodge, Boyle and Macdonald spent a lot of time discussing which chapters of the book would and would not translate into film. Hodge finished the first draft by December. Macdonald secured financing from Channel 4, a British television station known for funding independent films.", "The film's release sparked controversy in some countries, including Britain, Australia and the United States, as to whether or not it promoted and romanticized drug use. U.S. Senator Bob Dole accused it of moral depravity and glorifying drug use during the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign, although he later admitted that he had not seen the film. Producer of the film Andrew Macdonald responded to these claims in a BBC interview stating \"we were determined to show why people took drugs ... you had to show that it was fun and that it was awful\" to which Boyle adds \"It's the music and humour that makes people feel it's glamorising drugs.\"Movie Connections, [television programme, online], Prod. credit n.k., Prod. company n.k., Prod. country n.k., 22:35 26 January 2009, BBC ONE, 40mins. http://bobnational.net/record/215775, (Accessed 16 February 2016).

The project was instead financed by Fox's specialised film unit Fox Searchlight Pictures.
