John Milton's Lycidas first appeared in such a collection. It has few Horatian echoesOne echo of Horace may be found in line 69: \"Were it not better done as others use,/ To sport with Amaryllis in the shade/Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?\", which points to the Neara in Odes 3.14.21 (Douglas Bush, Milton: Poetical Works, 144, note 69) yet Milton's associations with Horace were lifelong. He composed a controversial version of Odes 1.5, and Paradise Lost includes references to Horace's 'Roman' Odes 3.1\u20136 (Book 7 for example begins with echoes of Odes 3.4).J. Talbot, A Horatian Pun in Paradise Lost, 21\u20133 Yet Horace's lyrics could offer inspiration to libertines as well as moralists, and neo-Latin sometimes served as a kind of discrete veil for the risqu\u00e9. Thus for example Benjamin Loveling authored a catalogue of Drury Lane and Covent Garden prostitutes, in Sapphic stanzas, and an encomium for a dying lady \"of salacious memory\".B. Loveling, Latin and English Poems, 49\u201352, 79\u201383 Some Latin imitations of Horace were politically subversive, such as a marriage ode by Anthony Alsop that included a rallying cry for the Jacobite cause. On the other hand, Andrew Marvell took inspiration from Horace's Odes 1.37 to compose his English masterpiece Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland, in which subtly nuanced reflections on the execution of Charles I echo Horace's ambiguous response to the death of Cleopatra (Marvell's ode was suppressed in spite of its subtlety and only began to be widely published in 1776). Samuel Johnson took particular pleasure in reading The Odes.Cfr. James Boswell, \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\" Aetat. 20, 1729 where Boswell remarked of Johnson that Horace's Odes \"were the compositions in which he took most delight.\" Alexander Pope wrote direct Imitations of Horace (published with the original Latin alongside) and also echoed him in Essays and The Rape of the Lock. He even emerged as \"a quite Horatian Homer\" in his translation of the Iliad.D. Money, The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 329\u201331 Horace appealed also to female poets, such as Anna Seward (Original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from Horace, 1799) and Elizabeth Tollet, who composed a Latin ode in Sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of Horace's sympotic settings:"]}, {"page": "Harold Holt", "response": ["Holt has been described as an \"apathetic agnostic\".

The second defence praised Oliver Cromwell, now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. Alexander Morus, to whom Milton wrongly attributed the Clamor (in fact by Peter du Moulin), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical Defensio pro se in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet Andrew Marvell.", "By 1652, Milton had become totally blind;John Leonard, in the introduction to \"Paradise Lost\", Penguin Classics page ix  2000 the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral retinal detachment or glaucoma are most likely.

One of his best-known sonnets, When I Consider How My Light is Spent, titled by a later editor, John Newton, \"On His Blindness\", is presumed to date from this period.", "Milton followed up the publication Paradise Lost with its sequel Paradise Regained, which was published alongside the tragedy Samson Agonistes in 1671. Both of these works also reflect Milton's post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674, Milton supervised a second edition of Paradise Lost, accompanied by an explanation of \"why the poem rhymes not\", and prefatory verses by Andrew Marvell. In 1673, Milton republished his 1645 Poems, as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.", "Milton's political thought may be best categorized according to respective periods in his life and times. The years 1641\u201342 were dedicated to church politics and the struggle against episcopacy. After his divorce writings, Areopagitica, and a gap, he wrote in 1649\u201354 in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I, and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659\u201360 he foresaw the Restoration, and wrote to head it off.Blair Worden, Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham (2007), p. 154.", "A friend and ally in the pamphlet wars was Marchamont Nedham. Austin Woolrych considers that although they were quite close, there is \"little real affinity, beyond a broad republicanism\", between their approaches.Austin Woolrych, Commonwealth to Protectorate (1982), p. 34. Blair Worden remarks that both Milton and Nedham, with others such as Andrew Marvell and James Harrington, would have taken their problem with the Rump Parliament to be not the republic itself, but the fact that it was not a proper republic.Worden p. 149.

A notable use is from the \"Miller's Tale\": \"Pryvely he caught her by the queynte.\" The Wife of Bath also uses this term, \"For certeyn, olde dotard, by your leave/You shall have queynte right enough at eve\u00a0.... What aileth you to grouche thus and groan?/Is it for ye would have my queynte alone?\" In modernised versions of these passages the word \"queynte\" is usually translated simply as \"cunt\". However, in Chaucer's usage there seems to be an overlap between the words \"cunt\" and \"quaint\" (possibly derived from the Latin for \"known\"). \"Quaint\" was probably pronounced in Middle English in much the same way as \"cunt\". It is sometimes unclear whether the two words were thought of as distinct from one another. Elsewhere in Chaucer's work the word queynte seems to be used with meaning comparable to the modern \"quaint\" (curious or old-fashioned, but nevertheless appealing). This ambiguity was still being exploited by the 17th century; Andrew Marvell's ... then worms shall try / That long preserved virginity, / And your quaint honour turn to dust, / And into ashes all my lust in To His Coy Mistress depends on a pun on these two senses of \"quaint\".Marvell, Andrew. \"To His Coy Mistress\".

This appointment may have been the result of influence exercised on his behalf by his cousin the Lord Chamberlain, Sir Gilbert Pickering. At Cromwell's funeral on 23 November 1658 Dryden processed with the Puritan poets John Milton and Andrew Marvell. Shortly thereafter he published his first important poem, Heroic Stanzas (1659), a eulogy on Cromwell's death which is cautious and prudent in its emotional display. In 1660 Dryden celebrated the Restoration of the monarchy and the return of Charles II with Astraea Redux, an authentic royalist panegyric. In this work the Interregnum is illustrated as a time of chaos, and Charles is seen as the restorer of peace and order.", "One of the first attacks on Dryden's reputation was by William Wordsworth, who complained that Dryden's descriptions of natural objects in his translations from Virgil were much inferior to the originals. However, several of Wordsworth's contemporaries, such as George Crabbe, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott (who edited Dryden's works), were still keen admirers of Dryden. Besides, Wordsworth did admire many of Dryden's poems, and his famous \"Intimations of Immortality\" ode owes something stylistically to Dryden's \"Alexander's Feast.\" John Keats admired the \"Fables,\" and imitated them in his poem Lamia. Later 19th-century writers had little use for verse satire, Pope, or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as \"classics of our prose.\" He did have a committed admirer in George Saintsbury, and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartlett's, but the next major poet to take an interest in Dryden was T.
