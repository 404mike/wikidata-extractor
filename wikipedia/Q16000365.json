In 1955, he won the micromagic category at the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Magiques (FISM), held in Amsterdam.

The group's vice-president, Dr. Jules Dhotel, wanted the ASAP to produce an international convention in Paris in October 1939, and then proceed to have the convention in a different country each year. Plans proceeded, but when the Nazis invaded Poland in September 1939, the convention was cancelled. After World War II, progress resumed. In 1946, a hotel in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, hosted an International Congress of Magicians, with over 300 registrants from around Europe. There were lectures, exhibits of antique books and apparatus, tours of Amsterdam, a public show, and a contest in which 20 magicians took part. There were no categories, so only one set of awards. First prize went to amateur French magician Jean Valton, for an exceptional routine of card juggling and manipulation; second went to Scotland's amateur magician John Ramsay, and third to a professional husband-wife duo, De Flezkis, who combined magic and dance."]}, {"page": "John Ramsay", "response": ["John Ramsay may refer to:", "*John Ramsay (British Army officer) (1775\u20131842), General and Member of Parliament for Aberdeen Burghs, 1806\u20131807", "*John Ramsay (of Kildalton) (1814\u20131892), Member of Parliament for Stirling Burghs, 1868, and Falkirk Burghs, 1874\u20131886", "*John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie (1847\u20131887), Scottish politician, Member of Parliament for Liverpool, 1880", "*John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell (c. 1464\u20131513)", "*John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness (c. 1580\u20131626), Scottish nobleman", "*John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736\u20131814), Scottish writer", "*John Ramsay (businessman) (1841\u20131924), Scottish-born Australian businessman", "*John Ramsay (commissioner) (1862\u20131942), Chief Commissioner of Balochistan", "*John Ramsay (surgeon) (1872\u20131944), Australian surgeon", "*John Ramsay (magician) (1877\u20131962), Scottish magician", "*John Ramsay or Johnny Ramensky (1905\u20131972), Scottish criminal", "*John Ramsay (Australian footballer) (1930\u20131983), Australian rules footballer", "*John Ramsay (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131917), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Ramsay (surname)", "response": ["*John Ramsay (disambiguation), several people, including", ":*John Ramsay (British Army officer) (1775\u20131842), MP for Aberdeen Burghs, 1806\u20131807", ":*John Ramsay (of Kildalton) (1814\u20131892), MP for Stirling Burghs, 1868, and Falkirk Burghs, 1874\u20131886", ":*John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie (1847\u20131887), Scottish politician, MP for Liverpool, 1880", ":*John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell (c. 1464\u20131513)", ":*John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness (c. 1580\u20131626), Scottish nobleman", ":*John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736\u20131814), Scottish writer", ":*John Ramsay (businessman) (1841\u20131924), Scottish-born Australian businessman", ";*John Ramsay (commissioner) (1862\u20131942), Chief Commissioner of Balochistan", ":*John Ramsay (surgeon) (1872\u20131944), Australian surgeon", ":*John Ramsay (magician) (1877\u20131962), Scottish magician", ":*John Ramsay or Johnny Ramensky (1905\u20131972), Scottish criminal", ":*John Ramsay (Australian footballer) (1930\u20131983), Australian rules footballer", ":*John Ramsay (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131917), Scottish footballer", ":*John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness (c. 1580 \u2013 1626), Scottish courtier"]}, {"page": "John Ramsay (magic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Ramsay (magician)"]}]}}
