In July 1919 he was promoted substantive Major in the Army and in October 1919 he formally retired with the substantive rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was put in charge of restoring morale following the 1919 police strike and also organised the policing of the victory march and other commemorations of the war. He pioneered police aviation and organised the first experiments in Britain with using the airship R33 to watch the crowds on Derby Day in 1921. Under his command, the Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch training depot at Imber Court was established. He also pioneered the use of police dogs in Britain.
