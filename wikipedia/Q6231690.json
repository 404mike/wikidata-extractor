The engineer John Smeaton proposed a solution for the drainage of the valley in 1767, but it was only partly implemented. William Jessop surveyed the river in 1788, and produced proposals to canalise the upper river above Lewes, and to radically improve the lower river. The Proprietors of the River Ouse Navigation were created by Act of Parliament in 1790, and eventually built 19 locks, to enable boats to reach Upper Ryelands Bridge at Balcombe. Trustees and the Commissioners of the Lewes and Laughton Levels jointly managed the work on the lower river, and the agriculturalist John Ellman continued the progress while he was Expenditor for the Commissioners, which enabled 120-ton ships to reach Lewes by 1829. Navigation on the upper river could not compete with the railways, and all traffic had ceased by 1868.", "From 1783, John Ellman, better known for his agricultural achievements, became the Expenditor for the Lewes and Laughton Levels, and as well as carrying out the tradition role of collecting the water scot tax and spending it, he worked tirelessly to organise and supervise work on the Glynde Reach and the lower Ouse, which enabled a 120-ton ship named Kitty to unload stone at Lewes Bridge in the late 1820s. He retired in 1828, and the following year the river flooded, but the results of the improvements were seen when the meadows drained in just 48 hours. Tapsfield's Shallow, near to Lewes Bridge, was finally removed by the engineer William Cubitt in 1838. Work on the west breakwater, a huge construction to protect the mouth of the river and enable ships to access the port of Newhaven at all states of the tide, began after a tramway link was constructed in 1866. It was completed in 1889, and the tramway was subsequently used to maintain the breakwater, until the tracks were lifted in 1963. For many years the locomotive used on the tramway was No. 72 Fenchurch, now preserved on the Bluebell Railway, which runs from  on the upper river to ."]}, {"page": "Mount Caburn", "response": ["Over later centuries the dominant agricultural activity became sheep grazing.

It is a shortwool breed, and the basis of the whole Down group of breeds. It was originally bred by John Ellman of Glynde, near Lewes in East Sussex, in about 1800. It has been exported to many countries; it has been of particular importance in New Zealand, where it was used in the breeding of Canterbury lamb. In the twenty-first century it is kept principally as a terminal sire.", "From Mediaeval times, small grey-faced polled sheep were kept on the chalk uplands of the South Downs of the counties of Kent and Sussex in south-east England. From about 1780 John Ellman, of Glynde, near Lewes in East Sussex, began selectively breeding them to improve their productive qualities; there are no records of how this breeding was carried out. By the end of the century the breed had become well known, its reputation rivalling that of the Dishley Leicester bred by Robert Bakewell. In the nineteenth century further selective breeding was carried out by Jonas Webb, of Babraham in Cambridgeshire, with such success that the breed was at times known as the Cambridgeshire.

Such improvements reduced the incidence of flooding, and improved the draining of the land if such an event occurred.

The Ouse above Lewes became the River Ouse Navigation, with 19 locks, and for the lower river, he suggested radical straightening, and removal of the shingle bar near the mouth of the river. The work was overseen by a Lewes schoolmaster and civil engineer, and was completed in 1795. Similar treatment of the Glynde Reach occurred between 1796 and 1803, and as well as enabling ships to reach Lewes, the faster moving tides drained the meadows much more effectively. Improvements continued in the early 19th century under the leadership of John Ellman, a renowned agriculturalist who became the Expenditor for the Lewes and Laughton Levels. Severe floods occurred in 1829, but the meadows drained within 48 hours.", "In 1780, John Ellman inherited the tenancy of Place Farm in Glynde from his father. Of its , some  was brookland, situated on the Laughton Levels, and although he knew that his education was lacking, he understood the importance of keeping accounts, a practice which his father had also kept. Ellman is best known for his agricultural achievements, particularly the improvement of the Southdown sheep breed, but he became part of the jury for the Commissioners of the Lewes and Laughton Levels in 1780, and its Expenditor in 1783. While this role traditionally involved supervising the collection of the water scot tax and its expenditure, Ellman worked tirelessly to organise and supervise work carried out on the Glynde Reach and in the valley. He produced estimates for the improvements, and while his contribution to the drainage and navigation of the Ouse is not fully understood, due to the fragmentary nature of the evidence, it appears to have been considerable. He supervised further work on the main channel to Newhaven, which enabled a 120-ton ship to unload stone at Lewes Bridge in the late 1820s. He retired from farming and the Commissioners in 1828, but the benefit of the work was demonstrated in April 1829, when although severe flooding occurred on the river below Lewes, the meadows had drained within 48 hours."]}, {"page": "Ellman, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Ellman"]}]}}
