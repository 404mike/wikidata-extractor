Clathrin was first isolated and named by Barbara Pearse in 1976. It forms a triskelion shape composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three light chains. When the triskelia interact they form a polyhedral lattice that surrounds the vesicle, hence the protein's name, which is derived from the Latin clathrum meaning lattice. Coat-proteins, like clathrin, are used to build small vesicles in order to transport molecules within cells. The endocytosis and exocytosis of vesicles allows cells to communicate, to transfer nutrients, to import signaling receptors, to mediate an immune response after sampling the extracellular world, and to clean up the cell debris left by tissue inflammation. The endocytic pathway can be hijacked by viruses and other pathogens in order to gain entry to the cell during infection."]}, {"page": "Lady Eleanor Holles School", "response": ["* Barbara Pearse, biological scientist "]}, {"page": "Pearse", "response": ["*Barbara Pearse (born 1948), British biological scientist"]}, {"page": "Mark Bretscher", "response": ["His father was Egon Bretscher, the nuclear physicist.

Mark Bretscher discovered the topological way proteins are arranged in the human erythrocyte membrane and its phospholipid asymmetry. Richard Henderson and Nigel Unwin developed electron crystallography to determine the structure of two-dimensional arrays, applying this to the bacterial purple protein, bacteriorhodopsin. Barbara Pearse discovered the major components of clathrin-coated vesicles, structures formed during endocytosis, and a low resolution structure of the cage-like lattice around them was determined. How proteins become localised to different parts of the cell \u2014 such as to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus or the plasma membrane \u2014 and the role of this in cell polarity, have been elucidated by Bretscher, Hugh Pelham  and Sean Munro. The spindle pole bodies \u2014 the large structures in yeast cells which act as the foci to which chromosomes are moved during mitosis \u2014 have been purified and a low resolution structure of them deduced by John Kilmartin.

Her interest was in  clathrin-coated vesicles that binds to cargo. She eventually succeeded in purifying components of the coat that were not clathrin and are now known as adaptor proteins. These proteins sit between clathrin, which forms the vesicle\u2019s outer shell and also the vesicle membrane. Continuing, Margaret discovered that there were two different populations of  clathrin-coated vesicles, one that uses AP-2 at the plasma membrane and one that uses AP-1 and was associated with intracellular membranes. AP-1 and AP-2 are both heterotetramers with related subunits. They both have two large subunits and the other subunit is closely related in AP-1 and AP-2."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1988", "response": ["#Barbara Pearse"]}, {"page": "Barbara Mary Frances Pearse", "response": ["#REDIRECTBarbara Pearse"]}, {"page": "EMBO Gold Medal", "response": ["* 1987  Barbara Pearse, UK"]}, {"page": "Frances Brodsky", "response": ["Brodsky's work straddles the interface of immunology and cell biology.  She developed some of the first monoclonal antibodies to the major histocompatibility complex, a protein that is central to the immune system. She became interested in clathrin, a protein that is key to both inward and outward membrane trafficking in cells, shortly after its isolation by Barbara Pearse. She used monoclonal antibodies to map the structure of clathrin and to probe its assembly into its characteristic polyhedral structures.  Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in the uptake of antigens from outside the cell that are eventually presented on the surface of the cell by the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II).  Brodsky discovered that the pathway of MHC class II export meets the antigen import pathway in a specialized endocytic compartment where antigens can be processed into peptides and loaded onto the MHC class II molecule for presentation. She also identified the site at which peptides are loaded onto MHC class I proteins."]}]}}
