Lily had been through several years training from her arrival until August 2015. The BBC have described Lily as an intelligent, logical, high-achiever who comes from a hard-working family that like to boast about their doctor daughter, but have never really told her they are proud of her. In 2014, series producer Erika Hossington spoke to Digital Spy about a series of standalone episodes the show would produce, revealing that the first standalone would feature Lily, \"The first one is a murder mystery and the character it features is Lily. That's been written by Jeff Povey. It's a great episode and it's all set at night. The hospital is empty, so it feels like a very ghostly place and that really feeds into the story that we're telling. It's brilliant and it feels very different.\"", "The casting was announced on 2 July 2014 that former EastEnders and Hollyoaks star, Gary Lucy, would be appearing in one of three upcoming standalone episodes that would air in November. Radio Times described the character as \"a loveable rogue, born charmer and conman who exists very much on the wrong side of the tracks\" and revealed that the episode, featuring Lucy, would revolve around a murder mystery. The show's series producer, Erika Hossington, announced that established character Lily Chao (Crystal Yu) would be the main character in the first standalone episode and that the episode would air on 1 November 2014, written by Jeff Povey. Hossington continued to talk about the episode's setting, \"It's a great episode and it's all set at night. The hospital is empty, so it feels like a very ghostly place and that really feeds into the story that we're telling. It's brilliant and it feels very different.\" The character was not announced until the episode's cast list was revealed."]}, {"page": "Povey", "response": ["*Jeff Povey, British screenwriter and novelist"]}]}}
