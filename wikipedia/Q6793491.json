His progress was halted by the Second World War, but he returned to the club when hostilities had ceased. Despite being a prolific goalscorer for the club's reserve team, he was unable to force his way into the first team and was transferred to Plymouth Argyle for \u00a34,000 in August 1947. He soon established himself as the club's first choice striker and finished as top goalscorer in five of his first seven seasons at Home Park. He left the club in 1955, having joined an elite group of players to have scored more than 100 goals, to finish his career in Northern Ireland as player-manager of Belfast Distillery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lisburn Distillery F.C.", "response": ["*  Maurice Tadman (30 June 1955 to 16 December 1958)"]}, {"page": "Derek Dougan", "response": ["Alexander Derek Dougan was born in Belfast on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan. His father worked at Belfast docks. His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for Linfield, and two of Sandy's brothers also played for some of the leading clubs in Belfast. As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that \"on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you got the money from\". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0\u20130 Irish Cup first round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area."]}, {"page": "Ernie Edds", "response": ["Edds began his career as an amateur with Portsmouth and later signed a professional contract with Millwall. He served in the British Army during the Second World War, which brought him to Plymouth. Edds was seen playing for an Army team in the Plymouth and District League by Plymouth Argyle and the club agreed a fee with Millwall for his transfer. Having made one appearance in his first season, Edds competed with Maurice Tadman for the centre forward position in the 1947\u201348 campaign and was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 23 matches. A move to the inside left and outside left positions saw his form suffer and he lost his place in the side at the start of the 1949\u201350 campaign."]}, {"page": "Eric Davis (footballer, born 1932)", "response": ["Born in Stonehouse, Plymouth, he began his career playing Rhyl while on national service. During this time he also had a trial at Chester, who he would join later in his career. Davis played for Tavistock Town when he returned to Devon and joined Plymouth Argyle in 1952. Having scored on his debut in March 1953, he was a back-up player to Maurice Tadman for two seasons and then played more regularly over the next three.

Thomas spent three seasons with Watford and was the club's leading goalscorer twice. He scored 41 league goals in 105 appearances before joining Gillingham in 1950, where he continued to score regularly. He was Gillingham's leading goalscorer in his first season with the club and was tied with Derek Lewis in the 1951\u201352 campaign. He left the club in 1953 and finished his career back in non-league football with Sittingbourne. He later managed Chatham Town and acted as trainer for Gravesend & Northfleet.
