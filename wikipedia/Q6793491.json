His progress was halted by the Second World War, but he returned to the club when hostilities had ceased. Despite being a prolific goalscorer for the club's reserve team, he was unable to force his way into the first team and was transferred to Plymouth Argyle for \u00a34,000 in August 1947. He soon established himself as the club's first choice striker and finished as top goalscorer in five of his first seven seasons at Home Park. He left the club in 1955, having joined an elite group of players to have scored more than 100 goals, to finish his career in Northern Ireland as player-manager of Belfast Distillery.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
