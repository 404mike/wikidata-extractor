William Howitt's visit was quite different: his account is called \"A day-dream at Tintagel\" (in Visits to Remarkable Places). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include Anthony Trollope's short story Malachi's Cove and the Charles and Alice Muriel Williamson's epistolary novel Set in Silver published in 1909. Ernest George Henham was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym John Trevena for many of his books; it is probable that the surname he chose was derived from the original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon. Tintagel features prominently in Edith Wharton's final, unfinished novel, The Buccaneers, the protagonist of which, Nan St. George, meets her future husband, the Duke of Tintagel, while exploring the ruins of Tintagel Castle. Wharton styled the characters as Duke and Duchess of Tintagel, while Tintagel actually lies within the Duchy of Cornwall; in the novel, the Duke and Duchess live in a newer, fictional Tintagel Castle, built in approximately the late 18th century."]}, {"page": "Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["*NORTH FACE: Joseph Priestley, Thomas Paine, William Hone, John Stuart Mill, Major Cartwright, Richard Carlile, William Lovett, William Carpenter, Henry Hetherington, John Frost, William Cobbett, W.

Thom & Co. Ltd., 2 Crown Street, 1935 most students entered Trinity College, Dublin as \"pensioners\"; in other words, they paid a fixed sum annually. The other two categories were \"sizars\" and \"fellow commoners\" (Socii Comitates). Sizars were \"allowed free education in consideration of performing certain, at one time menial, duties\"; fellow commoners paid double fees and enjoyed several privileges, including that of finishing the College course in three years instead of four; \"sizars were sons of poor parents, frequently the clergy\". According to William Howitt, writing in 1847 with reference to Oliver Goldsmith: ", "Trinity College, Dublin, is a noble structure; and, with its spacious courts and extensive gardens, more fittingly deserving the name of parks, one would think a place where the years of studentship might \u2014 especially in the heart of such a city \u2014 be very agreeably spent. But Goldsmith entered there under circumstances that were irksome to him, and to add to the matter, he met with a brute in his tutor. The family income did not allow him to occupy a higher rank than that of a sizer, or poor scholar, and this was mortifying to his sensitive mind. The sizer wears a black gown of coarse stuff without sleeves, a plain black cloth cap without a tassel, and dines at the fellows' table after they have retired. It was at that period far worse; they wore red caps to distinguish them, and were compelled to perform derogatory offices; to sweep the courts in the morning, carry up the dishes from the kitchen to the fellows' table, and wait in the hall till they had dined. No wonder that a mind like that of Goldsmith's writhed under the degradation! He has recorded his own feelings and opinions on this custom: \"Sure pride itself has dictated to the fellows of our colleges the absurd fashion of being attended at meals, and on other public occasions, by those poor men who, willing to be scholars, come in upon some charitable foundation. It implies a contradiction, for men to be at once learning the liberal arts and at the same time treated as slaves; at once studying freedom and practising servitude.\" A spirited fellow at length caused the abolition of the practice of the sizers acting as waiters, and that, too, on grand occasions before the public, by flinging the dish he was carrying on Trinity Sunday, at the head of a citizen in the crowd, assembled to witness the scene, who made some jeering remarks on the office he had to perform.William Howitt, \"Oliver Goldsmith\" Homes and Haunts of the Most Eminent British Poets (1847) 1:286\u2013336."]}, {"page": "1792 in literature", "response": ["*December 18 \u2013 William Howitt, English historical writer and poet (died 1879)"]}, {"page": "Household Words", "response": ["*The Holly Tree Inn in the Extra Christmas Number (15 December 1855) with Wilkie Collins, William Howitt, Harriet Parr, and Adelaide Anne Procter."]}, {"page": "Heanor", "response": ["*The Howitt brothers: William Howitt (1792\u20131879), author,William Howitt.
