Mark Bretscher discovered the topological way proteins are arranged in the human erythrocyte membrane and its phospholipid asymmetry. Richard Henderson and Nigel Unwin developed electron crystallography to determine the structure of two-dimensional arrays, applying this to the bacterial purple protein, bacteriorhodopsin. Barbara Pearse discovered the major components of clathrin-coated vesicles, structures formed during endocytosis, and a low resolution structure of the cage-like lattice around them was determined. How proteins become localised to different parts of the cell \u2014 such as to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus or the plasma membrane \u2014 and the role of this in cell polarity, have been elucidated by Bretscher, Hugh Pelham  and Sean Munro. The spindle pole bodies \u2014 the large structures in yeast cells which act as the foci to which chromosomes are moved during mitosis \u2014 have been purified and a low resolution structure of them deduced by John Kilmartin.

Returning to the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1975, Henderson worked with Nigel Unwin to study the structure of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin by electron microscopy.  A seminal paper in Nature by Henderson and Unwin (1975) established a low resolution structural model for bacteriorhodopsin showing the protein to consist of seven transmembrane helices.  This paper was important for a number of reasons, not the least of which was that it showed that membrane proteins had well defined structures and that transmembrane alpha-helices could occur.  After 1975 Henderson continued to work on the structure of bacteriorhodopsin without Unwin. In 1990 Henderson published an atomic model of bacteriorhodopsin by electron crystallography in the Journal of Molecular Biology. This model was the second ever atomic model of a membrane protein. The techniques Henderson developed for electron crystallography are still in use.", "* 1999 Awarded the Gregori Aminoff prize (together with Nigel Unwin)"]}, {"page": "Gregori Aminoff Prize", "response": ["|Richard Henderson (United Kingdom), Nigel Unwin (United Kingdom) "]}, {"page": "Cambridge Biomedical Campus", "response": ["The Institute of Metabolic Science (IMS) is dedicated to research, education, prevention and clinical care in the areas of diabetes, obesity and related metabolic and endocrine diseases.
