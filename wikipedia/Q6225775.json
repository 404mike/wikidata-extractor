The Cape Government reiterated its insistence that the matter was best left to local resolution and did not constitute an international war for imperial military intervention. High-pressure negotiations by Cape Prime Minister John Charles Molteno extracted a promise from Britain that imperial troops would stay put and on no account cross the frontier. Gcaleka forces of 8000 attacked a Cape police outpost near the frontier at Ibeka; a fierce shoot-out followed but the Gcaleka forces were dispersed. Soon, several other outposts and stations along the frontier were coming under attack. The Cape Government now had to use all available diplomatic leverage it had to keep the British imperial forces contained."]}, {"page": "List of names in A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Rationalists", "response": ["* John Charles Molteno"]}, {"page": "John de Villiers, 1st Baron de Villiers", "response": ["Altogether, he served as Chief Justice for 40 years, with \"an ever-growing reputation of the highest character for independence, legal ability, and irreproachable impartiality.\"P.
