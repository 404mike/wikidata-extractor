His parents were hatter Isaac Davies, and his wife Rachel.  They lived in the Llandovery area, where he attended a local school, and subsequently studied at Borough Road Training College. In 1858 became master of Mill Street school, \u2018 Ysgol y Comin \u2019, Aberdare, where he encouraged his assistants to use Welsh as the medium of education. In 1867 he moved to a school in Swansea, before in 1868 being made Assistant Inspector of Schools, moving first to Cheltenham (in 1870), then to Bristol (in 1877). In 1883 he returned to Wales, to a position in the Merthyr Tydfil district (though he lived in Cardiff).\nHe may be recognised, at the National Eisteddfod in Aberdare (1885), as one of the founders of the \u2018 Society for the Utilization of the Welsh Language ,\u2019 today known as \u2018 The Welsh Language Society.\nHe died in May 1887.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1887 in Wales", "response": ["*28 May \u2013 Dan Isaac Davies, educationist, 48"]}, {"page": "Evan Davies (educationalist)", "response": ["Evan Davies (26 June 1826 \u2013 22 August 1872) was a Welsh educationalist. He was born in the Llanycrwys area of Carmarthenshire, and attended school at Llansawel, where he was taught by William Davies (1805\u20131859). He later studied in Alfred Day's school, Bristol, and in Glasgow, on a scholarship, from where he graduated and obtained his M.A.; in 1852 he was awarded an LL.D. For a time he taught at the new Voluntaryist college (set up without government assistance) for teachers in Brecon (1846), where after a period of training, he was appointed principal. It later became \"Swansea Training College\", for women teachers, and Davies moved there with the institution, remaining for the rest of his life in Swansea. Despite the demise of the Voluntaryist movement and the resulting shortage of funds, Davies continued to run the institution as a private venture until 1867 when he passed it on to Dan Isaac Davies, instead moving to a career in law, eventually becoming a partner in a legal firm. While in Swansea, he became choirmaster at the New Congregational Church, until forced to abandon the role by ill-health."]}]}}
