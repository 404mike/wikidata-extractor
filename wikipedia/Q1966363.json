Feminist author Natasha Walter writing in The Independent wrote that the book \"has its faults, but compared with The Beauty Myth it has energy and spirit, and generosity too.\" Walter, however, criticized it for having a \"narrow agenda\" where \"you will look in vain for much discussion of older women, of black women, of women with low incomes, of mothers.\" Characterizing Wolf as a \"media star\", Walter wrote: \"She is particularly good, naturally, on the role of women in the media.\""]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["*Natasha Walter"]}, {"page": "Heather Mills", "response": ["In 2002, Mills accepted damages of \u00a350,000 plus costs from the Sunday Mirror, after a false report that the Charity Commission had investigated her about the money she raised for the Indian Earthquake Victims Appeal in 2001.

The poisonous judgmentalism that drives it, is in the worst tradition of small town gossip.

These include Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Natasha Walter, and Rene Denfeld. Each of these authors wrote popular books in the 1990s about feminism framed as calls to action like earlier works by Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer, but instead of agitating for political and economic change, they often argued in favour of the status quo. According to Stringer, this trend of 1990s agitation against \"victim feminism\" is tied to the concurrent rise of neoliberalism. At the same time, in her book Knowing Victims Stringer argues that these critiques of \"victim feminism\" do not affirm women's agency, but rather problematize women's capacity for agency and declare a lack of women's personal responsibility, which is, in Stringer's view, akin to victim blaming.Stringer, p. 20"]}, {"page": "Nicolas Walter", "response": ["Walter was heavily involved in the peace movement, being a founder member of the Committee of 100.
