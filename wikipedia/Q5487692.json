He played five First Division games for the \"Toffees\" in both 1934\u201335 and 1935\u201336, and three times in 1936\u201337. He kept goal in the Merseyside derby at the age of 17. However, he was unable to trouble the club's firmly established number one, Ted Sagar, and was transferred to Derby. There he picked up an injury after a challenge from Stoke City's Freddie Steele. Further injury problems forced his retirement at age 22, at which point he joined the police force. He guested for Southport during World War II. After the war he worked as a physio at Leicester City, Luton Town, and the Football Association. He died at the age of 86. He was the brother of former footballers George and Ray King.", "link_mentions": {}}}
