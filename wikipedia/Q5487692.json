He played five First Division games for the \"Toffees\" in both 1934\u201335 and 1935\u201336, and three times in 1936\u201337. He kept goal in the Merseyside derby at the age of 17. However, he was unable to trouble the club's firmly established number one, Ted Sagar, and was transferred to Derby. There he picked up an injury after a challenge from Stoke City's Freddie Steele. Further injury problems forced his retirement at age 22, at which point he joined the police force. He guested for Southport during World War II. After the war he worked as a physio at Leicester City, Luton Town, and the Football Association. He died at the age of 86. He was the brother of former footballers George and Ray King.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank King", "response": ["Frank King may refer to:", "*Frank King (English cricketer) (1911\u20131996), English cricketer, played for Cambridge University 1934\u201335 and Dorset 1937\u201354", "*Frank King (West Indian cricketer) (1926\u20131990), West Indian Test cricketer", "*Frank King (footballer) (1917\u20132003), English soccer player", "*Frank King (ice hockey) (1929-2004), retired ice hockey player", "*Frank King (Australian politician) (1912\u20131981), Australian politician", "*Frank King (Irish politician), Irish politician", "*Frank King (British Army officer) (1919\u20131998), British Army general", "*Frank King (cartoonist) (1883\u20131969), American cartoonist", "*Frank King (producer) (1913\u20131989), film producer"]}]}}
