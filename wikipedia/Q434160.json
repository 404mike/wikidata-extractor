He is probably best known today for his historical work on the radical movements in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, in particular The Making of the English Working Class (1963).Thompson published biographies of William Morris (1955) and (posthumously) William Blake (1993) and was a prolific journalist and essayist. He published the novel The Sykaos Papers and a collection of poetry.\nHis work is considered by some to have been among the most important contributions to labour history and social history in the latter twentieth-century, with a global impact, including on scholarship in Asia and Africa. In a 2011 poll by History Today magazine, he was named the second most important historian of the previous 60 years, behind only Fernand Braudel.Thompson was one of the principal intellectuals of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Although he left the party in 1956 over the Soviet invasion of Hungary, he nevertheless remained a \"historian in the Marxist tradition\", calling for a rebellion against Stalinism as a prerequisite for the restoration of communists' \"confidence in our own revolutionary perspectives\".Thompson played a key role in the first New Left in Britain in the late 1950s. He was a vociferous left-wing socialist critic of the Labour governments of 1964\u201370 and 1974\u201379, and an early and constant supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, becoming during the 1980s the leading intellectual light of the movement against nuclear weapons in Europe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 3", "response": ["*1924 \u2013 E.

One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and emphasise the \"relative autonomy\" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the \"forces of production\" and the succession of \"modes of production\". This has been the neo-Marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory such as E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists such as Antonio Gramsci who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.Ko\u0142akowski, Leszek.

Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers' esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in The Age of Reason, influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson has put it, Paine \"ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand.\"Thompson, 98. His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language and is \"an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost.\"Paine, The Age of Reason (1974), 156; see also Claeys, 102\u201303. Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of The Age of Reason.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's major study Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the Industrial Revolution. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with the political outcomes of the conflicts, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism. Erdman also notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery and believes some of his poems, read primarily as championing \"free love\", had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.Erdman William Blake: Prophet Against Empire p. 228 A more recent study, William Blake: Visionary Anarchist by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary William Godwin as forerunners of modern anarchism.

He has a loud voice and a nervous restless manner and a perfectly unaffected and businesslike address. His talk indeed is wonderfully to the point and remarkable for clear good sense.\" Morris's first biographer Mackail described him as being both \"a typical Englishman\" and \"a typical Londoner of the middle class\" albeit one who was transformed into \"something quite individual\" through the \"force of his genius\". MacCarthy described Morris's lifestyle as being \"late Victorian, mildly bohemian, but bourgeois\", with Mackail commenting that he exhibited many of the traits of the bourgeois Victorian class: \"industrious, honest, fair-minded up their lights, but unexpansive and unsympathetic\". Although he generally disliked children, Morris also exhibited a strong sense of responsibility toward his family. Mackail nevertheless thought he \"was interested in things much more than in people\" and that while he did have \"lasting friendships\" and \"deep affections\", he did not allow people to \"penetrate to the central part of him.\""]}, {"page": "1993", "response": ["* August 28 \u2013 E.

[...] In their scientific works, Marx and Engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers, but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society. All recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle, of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others.\" According to Paul Kellogg, there is \"some considereble controversy\" regarding \"the place of Frederick Engels in the canon of 'classical Marxism'\". While some such as Terrell Carver dispute \"Engels' claim that Marx agreed with the views put forward in Engels' major theoretical work, Anti-D\u00fchring\", others such as E. P.

In 1869, The New York Times described the system of wage labor as \"a system of slavery as absolute if not as degrading as that which lately prevailed at the South\". E. P. Thompson notes that for British workers at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the \"gap in status between a 'servant,' a hired wage-laborer subject to the orders and discipline of the master, and an artisan, who might 'come and go' as he pleased, was wide enough for men to shed blood rather than allow themselves to be pushed from one side to the other. And, in the value system of the community, those who resisted degradation were in the right\". A \"Member of the Builders' Union\" in the 1830s argued that the trade unions \"will not only strike for less work, and more wages, but will ultimately abolish wages, become their own masters and work for each other; labor and capital will no longer be separate but will be indissolubly joined together in the hands of workmen and work-women\". This perspective inspired the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union of 1834 which had the \"two-fold purpose of syndicalist unions \u2013 the protection of the workers under the existing system and the formation of the nuclei of the future society\" when the unions \"take over the whole industry of the country\". \"Research has shown\", summarises William Lazonick, \"that the 'free-born Englishman' of the eighteenth century \u2013 even those who, by force of circumstance, had to submit to agricultural wage labour \u2013 tenaciously resisted entry into the capitalist workshop\"."]}, {"page": "Mikhail Bakunin", "response": ["Bakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism, an opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat and for his predictions that Marxist regimes would be one-party dictatorships over the proletariat, not by the proletariat.
