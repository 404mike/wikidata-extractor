B. Lancaster. She was born in Tasmania, and brought up (from 1879) on a sheep station in Canterbury, New Zealand. She produced 13 novels, a collection of stories, two serialised novels and over 250 stories. \nShe was New Zealand's most widely read writer of the first half of the twentieth century. She wrote about the formation of colonial identity and the legacy of imperialism in the lives of settlers and their descendants. Her settings were Australia, Canada and New Zealand. She was influenced by Rudyard Kipling and R. L. Stevenson.Her first success was with The Law-bringers (1913), which was made into a Hollywood feature film in the 1920s (as was The Altar Stairs). Pageant (1933) topped the American best-seller list for six months. Other successes were Promenade (1938) and Grand Parade (1943).  \nLyttleton left New Zealand in 1909 for America, before settling in England. She died in a nursing home in London on 10 March 1945.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Zealand literature", "response": ["New Zealand literature continued to develop in the early 20th century, with notable writers including the poet Blanche Edith Baughan and novelist Jane Mander. New Zealand's most famous and influential writer in these years was the short-story writer Katherine Mansfield, who left New Zealand in 1908 and became one of the founders of literary modernism. She published three collections of stories in her lifetime: In a German Pension (1911), Bliss and Other Stories (1920) and The Garden Party and Other Stories (1922). She died in 1923, having (in the words of C.K. Stead) \"laid the foundations for a reputation that has gone on to grow and influence the development of New Zealand literature ever since\". Another notable early writer was Ursula Bethell, whose first poetry collection was published in 1929; her poetry is ascribed by the Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English as having \"a plainness and spareness (as well as freshness of image) which distinguishes it from the more ornamented verse the country had previously produced\". Edith Joan Lyttleton, who wrote as G.B. Lancaster, was New Zealand's most commercially successful writer in this period, known for her epic colonial romances. Herbert Guthrie-Smith's Tutira: The Story of a New Zealand Sheep Station (1921) was New Zealand's first significant environmentalist publication, and remains a classic of ecological writing; Michael King said in 2003 that it is \"still the best example of this genre.\""]}, {"page": "1945 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 10 March: Edith Joan Lyttleton, writer."]}, {"page": "Edith Joan Lyttelton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edith Joan Lyttleton"]}, {"page": "G.
