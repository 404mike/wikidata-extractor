He had served as a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers Voluntary Regiment. He had been the District Valuer for Newcastle upon Tyne from 1916\u20131918, so knew the town well. The seat was a newly created constituency and his prospects of winning were helped when no Unionist opponent came forward and he was endorsed by the Coalition Government led by David Lloyd George;  \n\nDespite being elected as a supporter of the government, Barnes resigned the Coalition Liberal Whip in November 1919 to take the opposition Liberal Whip. In parliament Barnes was associated with the more radical wing of the Liberals, due to his support for a number of social reforms. In particular he favoured the introduction of a Capital levy which in 1919 put him at odds with the caretaker Liberal Leader Sir Donald Maclean. Radical Liberals had proposed a Commons motion to introduce a capital levy which MacLean had failed to support. Barnes publicly criticised MacLean at that year's National Liberal Federation conference.He was strong supporter of Free Trade and served as Honorary secretary of the Cobden Club from 1920\u20131924. At the 1922 election he sought re-election again as the official Liberal candidate. Although he did not have a Unionist opponent, he found he was also opposed by a National Liberal supporter of the recently deposed Prime Minister, Lloyd George. This had the effect of splitting the Liberal vote with unfortunate consequences;\n\nIn December 1922 his successful Labour opponent died causing a by-election. He was again selected as the Liberal candidate. By then relations between Lloyd George and Asquith were improving and he faced no National Liberal candidate. However, a Unionist candidate intervened in the by-election with the same effect;\n\nHe decided to try his luck elsewhere and stood in Tynemouth at the 1923 general election. Tynemouth had been a Unionist seat since they gained it from the Liberals in 1918. He did well, but not quite well enough; \n\nHe contested Tynemouth again at the 1924 election, but in a difficult year for the Liberal Party his return to parliament was again thwarted;\n\nHe was also involved in local government politics in London. He served as an Alderman on the London County Council from 1923\u20131925, for the Liberal backed Progressive Party.In September 1927 Barnes was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for the Unionist seat of Warwick and Leamington. However, he was not called upon to contest the seat at an election. In 1928, Barnes instead contested a July by-election in the West Yorkshire seat of Halifax, following the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Henry Whitley, who had represented the seat as Liberal since 1900. This seemed to represent his best chance of returning to parliament but he was to be disappointed;\n\nHe did not stand for Parliament again.\nAt the 1934 LCC Elections he stood as a Labour candidate at Fulham East and was elected. He served as Chairman of the LCC's Town Planning Committee. However, he served on the LCC for little more than a year before his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tynemouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["thumb|120px|Harry Barnes"]}, {"page": "Halifax (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["thumb|120px|Harry Barnes"]}, {"page": "Newcastle upon Tyne East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Harry Barnes", "thumb|120px|Harry Barnes"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Harry Barnes"]}, {"page": "Harry Barnes", "response": ["Harry Barnes may refer to:", "* Harry Barnes (baseball) (1915\u20131993), American Negro league baseball player", "* Harry Barnes (basketball) (born 1945), American basketball player", "* Harry Barnes (footballer) (1903\u20132001), Australian rules footballer", "* Harry Barnes (Labour politician) (born 1936), British Labour Party MP for North East Derbyshire, 1987\u20132005", "* Harry Barnes (Liberal politician) (1870\u20131935), British Liberal Party MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, 1918\u20131922"]}, {"page": "1928 Halifax by-election", "response": ["thumb|150px|Harry Barnes", "The result of the three-way contest was a victory for the Labour candidate, Arthur Longbottom, who won with a majority of 4,951 over the Liberal Harry Barnes, who had previously been MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East.

This was a matter of some consternation for local politicians: Member of Parliament for Wallsend Matt Simm asked in 1920 whether the improvements to police terms and conditions would be applied to the River Police, but Home Secretary Edward Shortt noted that although the force fell within the provisions of the Police Act 1890 in respect of police pensions, pay was a matter for the force itself and not subject to national rules.  Newcastle upon Tyne East MP Harry Barnes pressed the government to apply the national regulations to the River Police, but Shortt declined.
