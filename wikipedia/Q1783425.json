Thus, in the early 1920s the growing university had to look for a more spacious campus as its original site in George Street, Brisbane, had limited room for expansion. In 1927, James O'Neil Mayne and his sister, Mary, provided a grant of approximately \u00a350,000 to the Brisbane City Council to acquire  of land in St Lucia and provided it to the University of Queensland as its permanent home. In the same year, the pitch drop experiment was started by Thomas Parnell. The experiment has been described as the world's oldest and continues to this day. Lack of finance delayed development of the St Lucia campus. Hence, the construction of the university's first building in St Lucia only began in 1938. It was later named the Forgan Smith Building, after the premier of the day and it was completed in 1939. During World War II, the Forgan Smith Building was used as a military base and it served first as advanced headquarters for the Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific."]}, {"page": "Pitch drop experiment", "response": ["The best-known version of the experiment was started in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, to demonstrate to students that some substances which appear solid are actually highly viscous fluids. Parnell poured a heated sample of pitch into a sealed funnel and allowed it to settle for three years. In 1930, the seal at the neck of the funnel was cut, allowing the pitch to start flowing. A glass dome covers the funnel and it is placed on display outside a lecture theatre. Large droplets form and fall over a period of about a decade.", "In October 2005, John Mainstone and the late Thomas Parnell were awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in physics, a parody of the Nobel Prize, for the pitch drop experiment.The 2005 Ig Nobel prize winners.

After Professor Ernest Rutherford of the University of Manchester declined it, Priestley's application was considered and voted favourably upon. Priestley would become Professor of mathematics and physics. He and his wife arrived in Brisbane in 1911, on the same boat as his colleague Professor John Lundie Michie. However Priestley soon realised he couldn't teach all the necessary subjects alone, and so Thomas Parnell, who was teaching at the University of Melbourne, found his application to lecture in physics successful. By 1919 the senate of the University decided to create separate departments of mathematics and physics. Priestley was offered either chair and chose mathematics. Thomas Parnell was offered the physics chair."]}, {"page": "Walter Heywood Bryan", "response": ["Following the 1935 earthquake in Gayndah, Queensland, a seismological station was set up at the University of Queensland. Earthquakes in Queensland being rare and this one being of significant strength to be felt at a great distance, Bryan's enthusiasm for establishing a means of researching seismic activity in Queensland, inspired willing benefactors to get involved. Two Milne-Shaw seismographs were donated to the University in quick succession. These were followed by other seismographs, enabling greater study of seismic activity in Queensland and overseas. Bryan would become the Officer in Charge of the UQ Seismology Station for many years. His enthusiasm for this research, commitment to the station and the results it collected, represent the second longest running experiment at the University of Queensland to date \u2013 after the Pitch drop experiment initiated by Thomas Parnell. Bryan and his colleague, Owen A. Jones later argued for further stations to be added to the north of Queensland to assist with accurate weather forecasting of cyclone events, earthquakes and sea disturbances. He and Dorothy Hill would work on new hypotheses to explain the growth of corals in the 1940s."]}, {"page": "Clive Selwyn Davis", "response": ["Davis campaigned for his new Department, finding that it was at least 20 years behind other universities he had attended.
