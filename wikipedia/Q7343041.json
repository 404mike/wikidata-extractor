The outbreak of war, and the necessity to provide large numbers of competent and qualified staff officers in the quickest time possible, had resulted in the course being considerably reduced from nearly two years to five months, and the pre-war competitive entrance exam was abolished. Stopford, promoted to temporary major general in January 1942, was there for just over a year, where many important lessons were learnt from the fighting in North Africa, until, in November 1942 Stopford handed over to Major General Sir Alan Cunningham."]}, {"page": "Staff College, Camberley", "response": ["*1939\u20131941 Major-General Robert Collins"]}, {"page": "Robert Collins", "response": ["Bob, Bobby, or Robert Collins may refer to:", "*Robert Collins (rower) (born 1924), retired British rower", "* Robert Collins (curler) in competitions such as the Avonair Cash Spiel", "*Robert Collins (physician) (1800\u20131868), Irish physician", "*Robert Collins (British Army officer) (1880\u20131950), British general"]}, {"page": "Phoebe Cusden", "response": ["In 1946, with information, support and assistance from people such as the publisher Victor Gollancz, General Robert Collins of the Royal Berkshire Regiment and the junior government minister Frank Pakenham (later Lord Longford), Phoebe led a local appeal for help for people in D\u00fcsseldorf and visited the city to find out the conditions under British occupation. The city was suffering extreme privation. By concentrating on the plight of its children, Phoebe was able to overcome potential prejudice against helping the recent foe.  She wrote to the Berkshire Chronicle in November 1946: \"It might be difficult for any one family to send an entire parcel, whereas they would be willing to contribute one or two articles. Therefore, a collection of foodstuffs is being organised under the title 'The Mayor's Winter Collection for German children.' I appeal most earnestly for the utmost generosity, which will create a feeling of goodwill between ourselves and the recipients, so necessary to future peace.\" Victor Gollancz had in November written to the national press saying that people in D\u00fcsseldorf were living on between 400 and 1000 calories per day, and that 400 was \"half the Belsen rate\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Fullbrook-Leggatt", "response": ["On 22 August 1939, just before the outbreak of war, Fullbrook-Leggatt was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier and was given command of the 184th Infantry Brigade, part of the 61st Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Robert Collins. The brigade was a second line Territorial Army (TA) formation, only very recently formed as a duplicate of the 145th Infantry Brigade, and was composed largely of part-time civilian soldiers. The outbreak of war saw the brigade mobilised for full-time war service, and training for eventual overseas service in France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), although the German invasion of France in May 1940 forestalled this, and the brigade, along with the rest of the 61st Division, now commanded by Major General Adrian Carton de Wiart, moved to Northern Ireland, after the BEF was evacuated from France and there was a possibility of the Germans invading the United Kingdom through Southern Ireland (see Operation Green)."]}]}}
