He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm fast-medium bowler.\nSimon \"Smudge\" Brown was one of the myriad of left-arm bowlers tried by England during the 1990s. Others included Mark Ilott, Alan Mullally, Mike Smith and Paul Taylor. Like Smith, he was a One-Test Wonder, playing in only a single Test match, which England lost against Pakistan in 1996. Despite taking two wickets, getting Aamir Sohail out with his tenth ball, he never played for England again.\nHe remained however a highly regarded bowler on the county circuit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["Botham retired from cricket midway through the 1993 season, his last match being for Durham against the visiting Australians at The Racecourse 17\u201319 July 1993. Durham batted first and scored 385 for eight declared (Wayne Larkins 151). In his final first-class innings, Botham scored 32. In reply, Australia could only make 221, thanks to Simon Brown who took seven for 70 (Botham none for 21). Being 164 behind, Australia had to follow on and a victory for Durham was possible but centuries by Matthew Hayden and David Boon saved Australia and the match was drawn. Botham's final bowling return was none for 45 from eleven overs. In the final over of the game, Botham also kept wicket, without wearing gloves or pads."]}, {"page": "Durham County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Simon Brown"]}, {"page": "The Boldons", "response": ["Boldon has produced many notable sports personalities, among them former Newcastle United footballer Wes Saunders.

Full back Jack Shreeve moved from the Villa to Charlton in 1935 and was a colleague of Bartram's in their 1947 FA Cup winning team. A Sam Bartram Memorial Cup competition was introduced at Boldon in February 2008 aimed at inspiring current footballing youngsters in the Boldon area.
