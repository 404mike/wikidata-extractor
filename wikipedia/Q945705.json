He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1921 to 1923 and 1927 to 1957.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "County Mayo", "response": ["Mayo, as all parts of what became the Irish Free State, was affected by the events of the Irish revolutionary period, including the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War. Major John MacBride of Westport was amongst those who took part in the 1916 Easter Rising and was subsequently executed by the British for his participation. His death served as a rallying call for Republicans in Mayo and led to Mayo men such as P. J. Ruttledge, Ernie O'Malley, Michael Kilroy and Thomas Derrig to rise up during the War of Independence. In the ensuing Civil War, many of these leading figures chose the Anti-treaty side and fought in bitter battles such as those in Ballina, which changed hands between pro and anti-treaty forces a number of times.", "In the aftermath of the Civil War, there was a consolidation of many of those with anti-treaty feelings into the new political party Fianna F\u00e1il. PJ Ruttledge and Thomas Derrig would become founding members of the party and served in Eamon de Valera's first-ever Fianna F\u00e1il government as ministers. Mayo politicians would continue to contribute to the national political scene over the decades. In 1990 Mary Robinson became the first-ever female President of Ireland, and is widely credited with revitalising the position with importance and focus it had never possessed before. In 2011 Enda Kenny became the first politician from Mayo to serve as Taoiseach, the head of government of Ireland. Kenny went on to become the longest-serving Fine Gael Taoiseach in Irish history."]}, {"page": "Se\u00e1n Lemass", "response": ["In December 1921, after the signing of Anglo-Irish Treaty, Lemass was released. He became a training officer for a period in Beggars Bush Barracks before the IRA split and was involved in the Belfast Boycott operations. During the debates of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, Lemass was one of the minority who opposed it along with de Valera. As a protest, all the anti-Treaty side withdrew from the D\u00e1il. In the Irish Civil War which followed Lemass was adjutant and second in command to Rory O'Connor, when the group seized the Four Courts, the home of the High Court of Ireland. The occupation of the Four Courts eventually resulted in the outbreak of the Civil War, when, under British pressure, the Free State side shelled the building on 28 June 1922.C Townshend, \"The Republic\", p.412 As a result, fighting broke out in Dublin between pro and anti Treaty factions. The Four Courts surrendered after two days bombardment, however, Lemass escaped with Ernie O'Malley and some others to Blessington.M. Hopkinson, \"Green against Green\", p.143-44. Their Flying Column operated in Enniscorthy, Tullow, Ferns, Baltinglass and Borris before the Column was broken up. Lemass and O'Malley returned to Dublin along with Thomas Derrig as a member of the IRA Eastern Command Headquarters but was later captured in December 1922 and interned again."]}, {"page": "Government of the 14th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Government of the 12th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Government of the 11th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Government of the 10th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig", "|rowspan=2|Thomas Derrig", "|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Government of the 9th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig", "|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Government of the 8th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Government of the 7th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Minister for Posts and Telegraphs", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig"]}, {"page": "Minister for Education (Ireland)", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig (1st time)", "|Thomas Derrig (2nd time)"]}, {"page": "Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications", "response": ["|Thomas Derrig (1st time)", "|Thomas Derrig (2nd time)"]}]}}
