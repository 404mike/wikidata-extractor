He was interviewed at the BBC by Charles Fletcher and offered a job as a presenter on the BBC Light Programme, the forerunner to BBC Radio 2. He declined, however, in favour of the less constrained world of pirate radio, where he began his career as a DJ for Radio London. It was while working here, that he was advised to change his name to avoid legal problems. He adopted the name \"Everett\" from a childhood hero, the American film comic actor Edward Everett Horton."]}, {"page": "Cole (surname)", "response": ["*Maurice Cole (cricketer) (1901\u20131971), South African cricketer", "*Maurice Cole (pianist) (1902\u20131990), English pianist"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists (recorded)", "response": ["* Maurice Cole"]}]}}
