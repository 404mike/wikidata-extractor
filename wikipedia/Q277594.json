The full-sized Tinto clay model, for the mould in which to cast this \"massive\" bronze, took eight months of \"arduous labour\" to complete by the evening of Friday 14 July; a hot night of 90 degrees Fahrenheit. His assistant moistened the clay that evening, but by seven a.m. the front of the model had exploded off its framework. The Scotsman reported: \"It was found a hideous ruin, great masses of clay having fallen away so as to expose the wooden framework on which the model had been built. The left arm lay on the floor at some little distance; the left hand side and upper half of the left leg, with a considerable portion of the front of the figure, were entirely gone; while the parts that remained showed several yawning cracks, with the exception of the head, which fortunately had escaped quite uninjured.\" It was speculated that as the framework and its supporting iron bar were intact, internal expansion of hot air had done the damage. The memorial committee granted an extension.The Scotsman, Thursday 20 July 1876 p4 col4: The black memorial", "Adam Black Statue Edinburgh.jpg|Adam Black (1877) in Princes Street Gardens"]}]}}
