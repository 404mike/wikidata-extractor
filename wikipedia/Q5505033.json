In 1956, Fritz Ursell examined available data on pressure variation in wind tunnels from multiple sources and concluded that the value of S found by Jeffreys was too large. This result led Ursell to reject the theory from Jeffreys.  Ursell's work also resulted in new advances in the search for a plausible mechanism for wind-generated waves. These advances led a year later to two new theoretical concepts: the Miles and Phillips mechanisms."]}]}}
