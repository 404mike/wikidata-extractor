The Shankill Butchers gang, including Moore, was subsequently rounded up by RUC Detective Inspector Jimmy Nesbitt from \"C\" Division and his team of CID detectives who were investigating the murders from Tennent Street RUC station.Taylor, p. 154 McLaverty had also told police that the car into which he had been abducted was a yellow Ford Cortina, a vehicle they knew from their surveillance that Moore drove.Bruce, pp. 178\u2013179 Moore and the rest of the members broke down and confessed to the killings, although they were too terrified to name Lenny Murphy as the ringleader. However, during one police interview, Moore sought to put the blame solely on Murphy. \"It was that bastard Murphy who led me into all this. My head's away with it\". After a lengthy period spent in jail on remand, Moore and the others stood trial in February 1979 at the Belfast Crown Court. Moore pleaded guilty to the most murders \u2013 a total of eleven \u2013  and was convicted of these, plus a further eight murders. On 20 February he was sentenced to life imprisonment inside the Maze Prison with the trial judge, Lord Justice O'Donnell, recommending that he and co-accused Robert Bates never be released. Judge O'Donnell addressed Moore with the following statements, \"You pleaded guilty to 11 murders carried out in a manner so cruel and revolting as to be beyond the comprehension of any normal human being. I am convinced that without you many of the murders would have not have been committed\". When being led from the court, Moore waved and smiled at the spectators in the public gallery."]}, {"page": "Searching for the Young Soul Rebels", "response": ["The figure on the left-hand side (with the long hair) is reputed to be Robert Bates, later a member of the Shankill Butchers."]}, {"page": "Orange Order", "response": ["A number of prominent loyalist militants were members of the Orange Order at the same time.
