Scabies formed a one-off band called \"Les Punks\" for a late 1978 gig: Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of The Damned (without Brian James or Lu) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist Lemmy of Hawkwind and Mot\u00f6rhead. The Damned tentatively reformed with the \"Les Punks\" line-up in early 1979, but originally performed as \"The Doomed\" to avoid potential trademark problems. Captain Sensible switched to guitar and keyboards, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances,see the notes for Smash It Up - The Anthology 1976\u20131987 and a slightly longer period with Henry Badowski on bass, the bassist position was filled by Algy Ward, formerly of The Saints.

Inspired by a Hawkwind gig he attended, Gray started learning bass guitar at the age of 13, his playing influenced by bassists such as Steve Currie, Lemmy, John Entwistle, Felix Pappalardi and Roger Glover. He joined Eddie and the Hot Rods as bassist after answering an advert in the Southend Evening Echo. The band had several hit singles and albums in the late 1970s, including \"Do Anything You Wanna Do\". While working with Eddie and the Hot Rods, he also recorded bass for Larry Wallis, Rob Tyner and Johnny Thunders, as well as filling in as temporary bassist for The Members. In early 1980, following the departure of Graeme Douglas, Gray left Eddie and the Hot Rods and, on the insistence of Captain Sensible and Rat Scabies, joined the punk rock band The Damned, replacing former bassist Algy Ward. Gray contributed to two studio albums, The Black Album and Strawberries, as well as numerous singles and the Friday 13th EP. Frictions in the band led to Gray's departure in February 1983.  Shortly afterwards, he joined UFO and remained until their split in 1987."]}, {"page": "Smash It Up", "response": ["* Algy Ward \u2212 bass", "Category:Songs written by Algy Ward"]}]}}
