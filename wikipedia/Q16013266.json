Stafford Cripps was a cousin. The family returned to England when hostilities in the Great War began. She attended Bedales School and, briefly, in her early 20s, the London School of Economics. In 1927, she married the journalist Malcolm Muggeridge, and the couple eventually had three sons and a daughter.\nThe Muggeridges were posted to the Soviet Union in 1932 by the Manchester Guardian. Then admiring the Bolsheviks, the couple described it as \"a wondrous development\" but quickly became completely disillusioned when both saw what was happening in the country. Kitty's aunt, Beatrice Webb, who, with her husband, Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield, had recently defended the Soviet Union in their book Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?, called Muggeridge's Manchester Guardian articles \"an hysterical tirade\" but was more restrained in her private communications with the couple.With Ruth Adam, she wrote Beatrice Webb: A Life 1858\u20131943 (1967), which although more a memoir than a scholarly book, was positively reviewed at the time. Her 1967 remark about the broadcaster David Frost (\"he rose without trace\") has been much quoted over the years.Like her husband, she became an admirer of the Calcutta-based nun Mother Teresa, about whom she wrote a book, Bright Legacy (1983), a work published the year after the couple had become Catholics. In that period, she translated two books by Jean Pierre de Caussade, the 18th-century French Jesuit priest.\nFollowing the death of her husband in 1990, Kitty Muggeridge lived with her son John and daughter-in-law in Welland, Ontario, Canada, where she died in June 1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beatrice Webb", "response": ["The Webbs became active members of the Fabian Society.

De Caussade himself was forced to withdraw for two years, 1731-1733, as spiritual director of a convent of nuns due to a charge of Quietism, but he was eventually acquitted of the charge.Sheldrake, Philip (2013). Spirituality: A Brief History. p. 129 John Wiley & Sons.  It may have been because of the spectre of being accused of Quietism (with the Church's condemnation of the Quietist movement and condemnation by Pope Innocent XI of the Quietest proponent Miguel de Molinos, and Molinos' death in the prison of Castel Sant'Angelo), the works attributed to de Caussade were kept unpublished until 1861, and even then they were edited by Rami\u00e8re to protect them from charges of Quietism. A more authoritative version of these notes was published only in 1966.Foster, xv-xvi. In his writings, the author is aware of the Quietists and rejects their perspective.Section VIII of Abandonment to Divine Providence Abandonment to Divine Providence has now been read widely for many years and is considered a classic in the spiritual life by Catholics and many others. Caussade spent years as preacher in southern and central France, as a college rector (at Perpignan and at Albi), and as the director of theological students at the Jesuit house in Toulouse, which is where he died.Richard J.
