This group of humans live a dangerous life in hiding from purges and the fanatical followers. Their purpose is simply to collect enough evidence to prove to their brethren that the claims of the Ori are false. Despite this, they do believe that the Ori are very powerful; it is only their intentions they doubt. Even though the group lives in the shadows of Ori society, they have collected a number of artifacts that they have kept hidden, since such pieces of technology contradict the book of Origin and thus would be destroyed if discovered. The group also has a number of followers in high positions even within the City of the Gods. All known members of this movement \u2013 Harrid (played by Stephen Park), Sallis (April Amber Telek), Fannis (Paul Moniz de Sa), Seevis (Michael Ironside), and Denya (Daniella Evangelista) \u2013 die shortly after their introduction.  Another member is introduced in Stargate: The Ark of Truth: Hertis (Chris Gauthier).  Tomin somehow finds him and takes him to meet with Daniel and Vala in order to find the location of Ortus Malum where the team believes the Ark of Truth to be.  He is somewhat suspicious of Daniel and Vala as they are unaware that the fires of Celestis are out (an indication that the Ori are dead) which should have spread very far.  Apparently Tomin told him they were from far away but just not how far (another galaxy).  In order to give him proof of their story, Daniel, Vala and Tomin take him to the Odyssey which is in orbit which is proof enough for him.  He tells them what is believed to be the location: a mountain high above the Plains of Celestis on another planet.  Presumably he is then returned to his home planet as he is not seen again."]}, {"page": "Steve Park (disambiguation)", "response": ["Steve or Stephen Park may also refer to:", "*Stephen Park (born 1962), British artist and performer", "*Stephen Park (British sport) (born 1968), Scottish yachtsman and performance director of British Cycling", "*Stephen Parke (born 1950), New Zealand physicist"]}]}}
