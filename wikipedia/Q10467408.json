Under McGrath, the club had lost thirteen of their opening seventeen league games.

Rudge understated things somewhat when he said: \"We cannot change things overnight.\" However, player Tommy Gore noted \"the players are in a more determined mood.\" He signed left sided midfielder Kevin Young on loan, and switched Eamonn O'Keefe from midfield to the attack. He was appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 9 March. He was unable to prevent relegation that year, though the club did avoid picking up the wooden spoon. Though Mark Bright and Robbie Earle were signed to Vale before Rudge's appointment, he helped to nurture their talents, both were the first of many to develop into outstanding players under Rudge."]}, {"page": "Thomas John Gore", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Gore"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["Wigan entered the FA Cup in the first round, but were knocked out by Bury following a replay.
