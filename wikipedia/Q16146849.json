East Middleton, the Hakets' portion of the manor, passed with Wolverton, with which it evidently became merged, as the joint holding was known as Wolverton alias Milton from the end of the 16th century onwards. West Milton apparently passed with East Standen to Joan Cooke, who leased it in 1514 to William Howles. The lease, and apparently later the tenancy, of the manor came like East Standen into the hands of the Meux and Bannister families, and in 1573 William Meux sold two parts of West Milton to John Worsley of Appuldurcombe, the remaining third being sold by Sir Edward Bannister in 1616 to Sir Richard Worsley. West Milton thus became united with East Milton, and subsequently followed its descent."]}, {"page": "Barry Leon", "response": ["Barry Leon is a former Commercial Court Judge of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court based in the British Virgin Islands.
