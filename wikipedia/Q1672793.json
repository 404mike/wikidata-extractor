He also suggests that the extreme intolerance and even endorsement of terrorism manifest in the fringe elements of Wahhabism and Salafism represents a deviation from Muslim historical traditions. El-Fadl also argues that the Salafi methodology \"drifted into stifling apologetics\" by the 1960s, marked by \"anxiety\" to \"render Islam compatible with modernity\". These apologetic efforts sought the defense of Islamic traditions from the onslaught of Westernization; while simultaneously maintaining the supremacy of Islam and its compatibility with modernity. However, according to El Fald, such efforts were being increasingly tainted by political opportunism and an unwillingness for critical engagement with the Islamic traditions.Abou El Fadl, Khaled, The Great Theft, Harper San Francisco, 2005, p. 77"]}, {"page": "Abdul Murad", "response": ["#REDIRECT Timothy Winter"]}, {"page": "Abdel Hakim Murad", "response": ["#REDIRECT Timothy Winter"]}, {"page": "Hakim Abdul Murad", "response": ["#REDIRECT Timothy Winter"]}, {"page": "Islamic terrorism", "response": ["Similarly, Timothy Winter writes that the proclamations of bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri \"ignore 14 centuries of Muslim scholarship\", and that if they \"followed the norms of their religion, they would have had to acknowledge that no school of mainstream Islam allows the targeting of civilians.\""]}, {"page": "Islam in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Timothy Winter, Dean of Cambridge Muslim College and Director of Studies at Cambridge University"]}, {"page": "List of contemporary Islamic scholars", "response": ["* Timothy Winter (born 1960) London"]}, {"page": "Abdul Hakim Murad", "response": ["#REDIRECT Timothy Winter"]}, {"page": "Al-Masih ad-Dajjal", "response": ["*Seeing with Both Eyes, transcript of a lecture on the Dajjal by Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad (born Timothy Winter)"]}, {"page": "Henry Winter", "response": ["Winter's older brother is academic Timothy Winter.Interview with elder brother Tim Winter in The Independent He is a trustee of the African social enterprise Alive & Kicking, which manufactures footballs in Kenya and Zambia."]}, {"page": "Abdul-Hakim Murad", "response": ["#REDIRECT Timothy Winter"]}, {"page": "List of converts to Islam", "response": ["*Joram van Klaveren \u2013 former Dutch MP, a politician who attempted to ban mosques and all Islamic practices from Holland; after working on a book to conclusively 'disprove' Islam, Joram's research (and discussions with Timothy Winter) drastically changed his views, he later converted to Islam", "*Timothy Winter (a.k.a.
