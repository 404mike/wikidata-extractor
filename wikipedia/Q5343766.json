The first Chief Whip, Vic Gould, was played by Edward Jewesbury in two episodes of Yes Minister.Opening episode, \"Open Government\", broadcast on 25 February 1980 Gould was initially intended to be a more prominent character in the series, as the writers thought he would continually force Hacker to pursue policies unappealing to Sir Humphrey, and thus lead to greater conflict.  They quickly found that Gould's character was largely unnecessary, and that the Hacker/Sir Humphrey conflicts worked just as well without him. In \"Party Games\", a later Chief Whip, played by James Grout and identified as \"Jeffrey\", conspires with Sir Humphrey to ensure that Hacker becomes Prime Minister. In 2 episodes of Yes, Prime Minister, Jeffrey is now played by Peter Cartwright. (In the novelizations, the character is given the full name of Jeffrey Pearson.)  Jeffrey is clueless about an alleged Cabinet plot against the Prime Minister ... because there is none, and Hacker is pursuing a false trail laid by Sir Humphrey.

Starring Ian McKellen as Richard (reprising his role from the stage production), John Wood as Edward, Nigel Hawthorne as George and Annette Bening as Queen Elizabeth, the film begins prior to the Battle of Tewkesbury, with Henry VI (portrayed by Edward Jewesbury) still in power. The opening scene depicts Henry and his son Edward (played by Christopher Bowen) preparing for the forthcoming battle. However, a surprise attack is launched on their headquarters by Richard, and both are killed. This scene is without dialogue. The last line of 3 Henry VI is also used in the film; Edward's \"For here I hope begins our lasting joy\" appears as a subtitle after the coronation of Edward and is altered to read \"And now, they hope, begins their lasting joy\", with \"they\" referring to the House of York. The film then moves on to the coronation of Edward IV (again without dialogue), before Richard delivers the opening speech of Richard III as an after-dinner toast to the new king. Like Olivier's film, Loncraine includes several characters in the coronation scene who are not present in the text of 3 Henry VI; Buckingham (played by Jim Broadbent), Richmond (played by Dominic West) and Elizabeth Plantagenet (played by Kate Steavenson-Payne). Richmond will later go on to be Henry VII, and Elizabeth (King Edward's daughter) will become his queen. As with Jane Shore, Elizabeth is mentioned several times in Richard III, although she never appears in the text. Loncraine's film also used a line from 3 Henry VI in its poster campaign \u2013 \"I can smile and murder whiles I smile\" (3.2.182), although \"whiles\" was changed to \"while.\" This line is also included in the film \u2013 after Richard concludes his opening speech to Edward, he enters the men's room and continues in soliloquy form to line twenty-seven of Richard III before then referring back to the earlier play \"Why, I can smile and murder while I smile/And wet my cheeks with artificial tears/And frame my face to all occasions\" (ll. 182-185).
