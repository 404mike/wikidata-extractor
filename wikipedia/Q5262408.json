He made his debut in a goalless draw with Crystal Palace at The Old Recreation Ground on 7 May 1949, as Bill McGarry was rested. This was his only appearance of the 1948\u201349 season. He played two Third Division South games in 1949\u201350. He also played twice in April 1953, as Stan Turner was rested, as manager Freddie Steele led the club to a second-place finish in the Third Division North in 1952\u201353. He filled in for seven games for Derek Tomkinson and Turner in 1953\u201354, as the \"Valiants\" finished the campaign as champions. He did not feature at Vale Park in the Second Division 1954\u201355 campaign, and moved on to Wereton Queen's Park."]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["| 1951 || FW ||  || Derek Tomkinson || Burton Albion || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Derek Tomkinson", "| December 1952 || FW ||  || Derek Tomkinson || Burton Albion || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The key players that formed the first eleven of 1953\u201354 were: Ray King (goalkeeper); Reg Potts and Stan Turner (full-backs); Tommy Cheadle, Albert Leake, Roy Sproson (half-backs); Colin Askey, John Cunliffe, Ken Griffiths, Basil Hayward, and Albert Mullard (forwards); Derek Tomkinson (reserve forward). Their achievements came as a team, without any outstanding stars, which caused The Sentinel to remark that the whole team were stars.", "Vale lost by a single goal at Redheugh Park against Gateshead on 12 September; Vale, playing in their change kit, were beaten by a 57th-minute goal from John Ingham. This brought to an end the club's then-record streak of 16 games unbeaten. Four days later Vale recorded a 2\u20131 win over Bradford Park Avenue at the Horsfall Stadium despite Reg Potts being injured with a swollen ankle early in the match. A 2\u20130 home win over Workington on 19 September began a sequence of five clean sheets, with Jim Elsby standing in for Potts as Steele changed the starting line-up for the first time in eight games \u2013 this brought Potts' run of 73 consecutive appearances to an end. The defensive fivesome of keeper Ray King, Tommy Cheadle, Reg Potts, Stan Turner and Roy Sproson began to be known as 'the Iron Curtain' or 'the Steele Curtain' (a play on the manager's name). A 21 September game against nearby unbeaten Crewe Alexandra was billed as a 'crunch clash' between first and second, and a Sproson goal on 87 minutes won the match for the Vale. For the return a week later a stadium record 17,883 packed into Gresty Road to witness a goalless draw at Crewe. The attendance figures were helped by the management team of the Crewe Works, who allowed their workforce to leave work an hour early in order to make it for the 5:10pm kick-off. The draw was achieved despite injuries to Albert Leake, Hayward and John Cunliffe, who were replaced by Derek Tomkinson, Roland Lewis and Mick Hulligan.", "Steele was investigated by a joint FA/Football League inquiry for his time as Mansfield Town manager in regard to suspected illegal payments \u2013 found guilty, he was given a \u00a3250 fine. The good run of results continued though, as they beat fifth-placed Barnsley 1\u20130 at Oakwell through a Hayward goal. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day Vale recorded two 1\u20130 wins over Chester, with Hayward again the only player to find the net. Captain Tommy Cheadle pulled a hamstring against Chester, and lost his place in the team as Steele moved the positions around to accommodate Derek Tomkinson in the team. Roland Lewis was made available on a free transfer in December, and moved to non-league side Witton Albion.", "The 25,000 tickets Vale were allotted for the semi-final clash with West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park sold out on the first day. In all 100 coaches and 14 excursion trains took the supporters to Birmingham for the match on 27 March, at which time high-scoring West Brom were top of the First Division \u2013 in all 68,221 spectators packed into the stadium. This meant the match secured the club a total of \u00a320,086 in gate receipts. Ken Griffiths was unable to recover from a knee injury in time for the match and so was replaced by Derek Tomkinson, this was the first and only change to the first eleven throughout the cup run. In the match itself, Albion's 'constructive play' was halted by the Vale defence, and a Leake goal on 40 minutes saw Vale 1\u20130 up at half-time. The second half saw the \"Throstles\" switch to a long ball game, and on 62 minutes Cheadle was bustled off the ball and could only watch the equaliser cross the line. Eight minutes later captain Cheadle was judged to have fouled George Lee just inside the penalty box, though the Port Vale players maintained that the challenge took place well outside of the box, and that Lee also handled the ball. Former \"Valiant\" star Ronnie Allen converted the resulting penalty. Later in the match Leake had an equalising goal disallowed for offside, and Vale therefore failed to be the first third-tier club to reach an FA Cup Final.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Derek Tomkinson", "|6||FW||||Derek Tomkinson||5||0||5"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Derek Tomkinson", "| Summer 1955 || FW ||  || Derek Tomkinson || Crewe Alexandra || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Derek Tomkinson (1931\u20132021), played for Port Vale."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2021", "response": ["*Derek Tomkinson, 90, English footballer (Port Vale, Macclesfield Town, Crewe Alexandra).Derek Tomkinson (1931 - 2021)"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 in English football", "response": ["* 28 July 2021: Derek Tomkinson, 90, Port Vale and Macclesfield Town forward"]}]}}
