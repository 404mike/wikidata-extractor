His figures were nine for 37 while Lock's were one for 37.", "In 2006, Peter Richardson considered the differences between Laker and Lock, saying that Laker was \"slightly cynical, difficult to connect with, laconic and moody\". Richardson said that Laker and Lock did not get on together and were always competing. Their approaches to the game differed as Lock \"would attack\" while Laker just kept \"chipping away\". Richie Benaud had also noted their different characteristics in the way they appealed for a dismissal: \"Laker was apologetic, Lock a demander\". May, who was Laker's Surrey captain after Stuart Surridge retired in 1956, said that the mere idea of Laker showing enthusiasm was \"absurd\"."]}, {"page": "Tenterden", "response": ["* Peter Richardson, the Worcestershire, Kent and England cricketer, lived in the town in later life."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Peter Richardson"]}, {"page": "Keith Miller", "response": ["By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was shouldering most of the bowling load.
