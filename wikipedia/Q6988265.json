The Conservatives selected merchant banker Neil Balfour and the Liberals adopted George Suggett, an antique dealer from Newbury in Berkshire but who had been born in the constituency and who was the son of a Durham miner.The Times, 19 February 1973, p. 3 The Liberals had not contested any Parliamentary election in Chester-le-Street since the 1929 general election.The Times, 18 January 1973, p. 2 Suggett himself had previously stood for the Newbury seat in 1945 as a member of the Common Wealth Party.", "By any measure Chester-le-Street was a very safe Labour seat and the party had held it for nearly 70 years.The Times, 19 February 1973, p. 3 At a time of Conservative government which was proving difficult for Prime Minister Edward Heath, damaged politically as he was by a series of economic and social problemsChris Cook and John Ramsden, By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 p. 195 there was no expectation of a serious challenge for Tory candidate Neil Balfour.", "In the aftermath of this controversy, Labour turned its attack on the campaign of the Liberal candidate, accusing George Suggett of trying to smear Giles Radice personally and of trying to capitalise unfairly on the nomination issue. At the declaration of the votes, Radice announced that whereas the Conservatives had conducted a clean and honest campaign, he was not going to comment on the approach of his other opponent.The Times, 3 March 1973, p. 2 As Suggett tried to make his speech after the declaration he was constantly heckled and jeered by the Labour supporters, who were later silent for the speech of Neil Balfour. Suggett denied he had smeared Radice and invited the press to review his election literature and campaign speeches for any evidence of misconduct. He said the real reason was so angry was that the Liberals had \"broken the weighbridge on which the Labour majority in Chester-le-Street used to be weighed\".The Times, 3 March 1973, p. 3 Cyril Smith, who had campaigned for Suggett in the by-election, recalled later that he deliberately, if obliquely, had raised the issue of political corruption by mentioning in a speech at the opening of the campaign the T. Dan Smith affair and how it was uncovering new instances of corruption amongst Labour councillors in the North East, including one from Chester-le-Street who later went to prison. As far as the Liberal Party was concerned, commented Smith, this was legitimate political meat and needed no apology.Cyril Smith, Big Cyril, The Autobiography of Cyril Smith; W H Allen, 1977 p. 148", "Radice held the seat for Labour with a majority of 7,066 over Suggett, having taken 53% of the poll. Balfour came third, losing his deposit. Radice went on to represent Chester-le-Street in the Labour interest until the seat was abolished in 1983. He was then selected as Labour candidate for North Durham the successor seat which included large parts of the old Chester-le-Street constituency, until he stood down from Parliament at the 2001 general election. Neil Balfour fought Chester-le-Street again at the February 1974 general election again coming third behind the Liberals. Perhaps bruised by the attacks upon him, Suggett does not appear to have been a candidate at any further Parliamentary elections but played an active but more backroom role in Newbury."]}, {"page": "Edwin F.
