He is famous for the thesis outlined in his book Ancient Law that law and society developed \"from status to contract.\" According to the thesis, in the ancient world individuals were tightly bound by status to traditional groups, while in the modern one, in which individuals are viewed as autonomous agents, they are free to make contracts and form associations with whomever they choose. Because of this thesis, Maine can be seen as one of the forefathers of modern legal anthropology, legal history and sociology of law.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Maine", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry James Sumner Maine"]}, {"page": "Christ's Hospital", "response": ["*Maine \u2013 Henry James Sumner Maine (boys)"]}, {"page": "Edward Burnett Tylor", "response": ["Two other classifications were proposed in 1993 by Upadhyay and Pandey, Classical Evolutionary School and Neo Evolutionary School, the Classical to be divided into British, American, and German. The Classical British Evolutionary School, primarily at Oxford University, divided society into two evolutionary stages, savagery and civilization, based on the archaeology of John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. Upadhyay and Pandey list its adherents as  Robert Ranulph Marett, Henry James Sumner Maine, John Ferguson McLennan, and James George Frazer, as well as Tylor. Marett was the last man standing, dying in 1943. By the time of his death, Lubbock's archaeology had been updated. The American School, beginning with Lewis Henry Morgan, was likewise superseded, both being replaced by the Neoevolutionist School, beginning with V. Gordon Childe. It brought the archaeology up-to-date and tended to omit the intervening society names, such as savagery; for example, Neolithic is both a tool tradition and a form of society."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom labour law", "response": ["Labour law in its modern form is primarily a creation of the last three decades of the 20th century. However, as a system of regulating the employment relationship, labour law has existed since people worked.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 1. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 1 In feudal England, the first significant labour laws followed the Black Death. Given the shortage of workers and consequent price rises the Ordinance of Labourers 1349 and the Statute of Labourers 1351 attempted to suppress sources of wage inflation by banning workers organisation, creating offences for any able-bodied person that did not work, and fixing wages at pre-plague levels. Ultimately this led to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which was in turn suppressed and followed up with the Statute of Cambridge 1388, which banned workers from moving around the country. Yet conditions were improving as serfdom was breaking down. One sign was the beginning of the more enlightened Truck Acts, dating from 1464, that required that workers be paid in cash and not kind. In 1772 slavery was declared to be illegal in R v Knowles, ex parte Somersett,(1772) 20 State Tr 1 and the subsequent Slave Trade Act 1807 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833 enforced prohibition throughout the British Empire.However, it was not until the Criminal Justice Act 1948 that penal servitude, forced labour for prisoners, was abolished. The turn into the 19th century coincided with the start of the massive boom in production. Gradually people's relationship to their employers moved from one of status - formal subordination and deference - to contract whereby people were formally free to choose their work.See Henry James Sumner Maine, Ancient Law (1861) However, freedom of contract did not, as the economist Adam Smith observed, change a worker's factual dependency on employers."]}, {"page": "Whewell Professor of International Law", "response": ["*1887: Sir Henry James Sumner Maine "]}, {"page": "Regius Professor of Civil Law (Cambridge)", "response": ["* Henry James Sumner Maine (1847)"]}, {"page": "Brahmo Samaj", "response": ["After the controversy of underage marriage of Keshub Chunder Sen's daughter, the Special Marriages Act of 1872 was enacted to set the minimum age of 14 years for marriage of girls.
