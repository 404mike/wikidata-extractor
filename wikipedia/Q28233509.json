Ground-penetrating radar confirmed the presence of a skeleton of the right age and build for Yeardley who died in 1627, aged about 40. The gender, age estimate, the way the body was laid out and its prominent location within the church, support its identity as Yeardley. Another church was built on top but the position indicates a high status burial. Although the head is missing, 10 teeth have been found and tests are being carried out by the FBI and archaeologist and geneticist Turi King, who helped identify the remains of Richard III in 2012. King will assist in tracking down Yeardley relatives to compare DNA found in the remains. The results could take several months but should be available in time for 2019's 400th Anniversary of Sir George Yeardley's Great Reforms and the first General Assembly which introduced them."]}, {"page": "The Genetics Society", "response": ["| 2018 || Turi King"]}, {"page": "Non-paternity event", "response": ["Turi King and Mark Jobling of the Department of Genetics at University of Leicester called the commonly cited 30% rate of non-paternity an \"urban myth\". According to King and Jobling, the figure is around 2%. They also stated that misattributed paternity is often impacted by cultural and socioeconomic factors and that it occurs more frequently among couples who aren't married. Sociologist Michael Gilding concluded that inflated figures have been circulated by the media, the paternity testing industry,  fathers' rights activists and evolutionary psychologists. He traced many of these overestimates back to a 1972 conference where non-paternity rates as high as 30% were discussed. Gilding states that these data only show the incidence of non-paternity in cases where disputed parentage was the reason for paternity testing.  In situations where disputed parentage was the reason for the paternity testing, there were higher levels with an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk of parental discrepancy were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain ethnic and cultural groups."]}, {"page": "Stacey Dooley", "response": ["In 2021, Dooley, with Turi King, presented the BBC programme DNA Family Secrets which helps people solve family mysteries regarding their ancestry, missing relatives and genetic diseases."]}, {"page": "Exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England", "response": ["Despite the matching mitochondrial DNA, geneticist Turi King continued to pursue a link between the paternally-inherited Y\u00a0DNA and that of descendants of John of Gaunt. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are a match to each other. The Y\u00a0DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19\u00a0generations between Richard\u00a0III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of false paternity are around 1\u20132% per generation.", "Caroline Wilkinson, Professor of Craniofacial Identification at the University of Dundee, led the project to reconstruct the face, commissioned by the Richard III Society.

Richard III is thus the first ancient person with known historical identity whose genome has been sequenced. A study published in Nature Communications in December 2014 confirmed a perfect whole-mitochondrial genome match between Richard's skeleton and Michael Ibsen and a near-perfect match between Richard and his other confirmed living relative. However, Y chromosome DNA inherited via the male line found no link with five other claimed living relatives, indicating that at least one \"false-paternity event\" occurred in the generations between Richard and these men. One of these five was found to be unrelated to the other four, showing that another false-paternity event had occurred in the four generations separating them.King, Gonzalez Fortes, Balaresque et al (2014)"]}, {"page": "The Life Scientific", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"King, Turi\"|Turi King"]}, {"page": "Who We Are and How We Got Here", "response": ["The archaeologist and geneticist Turi King, in Nature, writes that Reich's laboratory \"has developed some of the most sophisticated statistical and bioinformatics techniques available.
