At the time of her birth, Osborne was researching that war and writing the screenplay of the film his next wife would star in. (Osborne, p. 240) Osborne had an abusive relationship with his daughter: he cast her out of his house when she was 17; they never spoke again. Osborne and Gilliatt's marriage suffered through what Osborne perceived to be an unnecessary obsession on her part with her work, writing film reviews for The Observer. \"I tried to point out that it seemed an inordinate amount of time and effort to expend on a thousand-word review to be read by a few thousand film addicts and forgotten almost at once.\" Osborne, a misogynist, wanted Gilliatt to give up her careers as a film critic, theatre critic, short story writer, novelist, opera librettist, screenwriter, and writer of books on movie comedy and film directors, and move with him to a country house where she would tend his needs, including his growing alcoholism. Osborne had put a refrigerator in the couple's bedroom and filled it with champagne to alleviate his night terrors, which Gilliatt helped guide him through. Behind her back, he conducted a long-term affair with Jill Bennett, who passed herself off as Gilliatt's best friend. Kenneth Tynan described Osborne and Bennett's behavior as the most duplicitous that he had ever witnessed. It was only after this betrayal that Gilliatt's drinking increased. She refused to give up her ambitions and careers and Osborne demonized her for it. He remained a misogynist and homophobe until the end of his life.", "He also observed in her a growing pretentiousness. \"She was to become increasingly obsessed with fripperies and titles \u2026 She took to calling herself 'Professor Gilliatt'.\"Osborne, p. 240 Strains in the marriage, exacerbated by Gilliatt's alcoholism and what Osborne felt was malignant behaviour, led to Osborne conducting an affair with Jill Bennett, soon followed by their marriage. Osborne had numerous affairs behind her back. He could not cope with her decision to not give up her professional life in its entirety to take care of him in obscurity in an old country house. He began hurling criticism of her afterward, in rages of misogyny.  He also hated her friends in the LGBTQ+ community. Gilliatt was also well known as his intellectual superior, which he hated. All comments about Gilliatt made by Osborne are suspect and should be interpreted in the light of his assorted bigotries and alcoholism.", "==== Jill Bennett (1968\u20131977) ====", "Osborne had a turbulent nine-year marriage to the actress Jill Bennett, whom he came to loathe. Their marriage degenerated into mutual abuse and insult with Bennett goading Osborne, calling him \"impotent\" and \"homosexual\" in public as early as 1971. This was cruelty which Osborne reciprocated, turning his feelings of bitterness and resentment about his waning career onto his wife. Bennett's suicide in 1990 is generally believed to have been a result of Osborne's rejection of her. He said of Bennett, \"She was the most evil woman I have come across\", and showed open contempt for her suicide.Heilpern writes () that the second volume of Osborne's autobiography was ready to go to press at Faber and Faber. Bennett's suicide freed Osborne from the restraining order arising from their bitter divorce. He sat down and wrote a new chapter for the book, specifically to excoriate his ex-wife."]}, {"page": "1990 in film", "response": ["| The Sheltering Sky || Warner Bros.
