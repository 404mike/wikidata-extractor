Hailing from Barrow-in-Furness, he began his senior career in the Football League Third Division North with hometown club Barrow in June 1921. Phizacklea scored three goals in 71 League appearances for the Holker Street club before moving to fellow Third Division North outfit Nelson on a free transfer in the summer of 1924. He made his Nelson debut in the first match of the 1924\u201325 season, a 0\u20131 defeat away at Southport, and went on to play 21 competitive matches for the club. In January 1925, Phizacklea joined Football League First Division side Preston North End for a fee of \u00a31,000.\nAfter making 22 appearances for Preston, Phizacklea moved to South Shields, where he played 68 League games during two years with the club. Between 1928 and 1930 he played in the Southern Football League with Thames Association. He returned north in August 1930 to sign for Stockport County, but failed to make a first-team appearance for the side and subsequently had spells with Guildford City and as an amateur player with Roneo Sports in Romford. Phizacklea died in the village of Ardleigh, Essex, in 1971 at the age of 72.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Guildford City F.C.", "response": ["* James Phizacklea"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["While there were several changed to the playing staff, the core of the team that had played in the Second Division remained intact. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top goalscorer in each of the previous three seasons, was retained along with captain Clem Rigg, Welsh half-back Jack Newnes and goalkeeper Harry Abbott. The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively. Inside forward Dick Crawshaw, who had been the team's second-highest scorer in 1923\u201324 with five goals, moved to Stalybridge Celtic.Dykes (2009), p. 30 Scottish forward Mike McCulloch ended his two-year association with the club by joining Chesterfield on a free transfer, while half-back Leigh Collins signed for New Brighton. Other players, including William Lammus and Ernest Gillibrand, left Nelson having failed to establish themselves in the first-team during their time with the club.Dykes (2009), p. 37 Manager Wilson spent a total of \u00a3750 (\u00a3 as of 2011) on new players in the summer of 1924. Billy Bottrill and Bill Ellerington arrived from Middlesbrough, while Barrow full-back James Phizacklea was signed to bolster the defensive line.Dykes (2009), p. 58 Several young players were acquired from local non-League football during the close season, including Ambrose Harris from Briercliffe and Billy Harper, formerly of Feniscowles. The Nelson squad was considered by the local newspaper to be stronger than the one which had won the Third Division North two seasons earlier.", "| James Phizacklea", "| James Phizacklea", "Nelson began their league campaign on 30 August 1924 with an away match at Southport, who had ended the previous season in seventh position. New signings Billy Bottrill, Bill Ellerington and Joseph O'Beirne went straight into the starting line-up but they could not prevent Southport winning by a single goal from Jack Barber,  giving them their first ever League win against Nelson. A week later, Nelson played their first home game of the season, in which James Phizacklea made his debut for the club. A crowd of around 6,000 saw Ashington beaten 4\u20130 thanks to goals from Bottrill, Joe Eddleston, Jack Newnes and Sid Hoad. Three days later, Eddleston scored twice as Doncaster Rovers were defeated by three goals to nil in the first midweek match of the campaign. However, Nelson could not continue their winning streak as they lost 0\u20132 against Accrington Stanley at Peel Park in the following fixture. On 16 September, Nelson achieved their biggest victory in the Football League at that time with a 7\u20131 win over Durham City at Seedhill. The game saw Eddleston score his first hat-trick since the 3\u20130 victory away at Rochdale in January 1923, and O'Beirne and Eddie Cameron score their first goals of the season. Four days later, Nelson suffered their third consecutive defeat away from home, losing 0\u20133 to Barrow at Holker Street. The team continued their good home form the following week with a narrow win against Lincoln City. Nelson named the same team for the seventh game in succession for the trip to Tranmere Rovers on 4 October, but the side were beaten for the fourth straight away match thanks to goals from Dixie Dean and Jimmy Moreton.", "|align=\"left\"|James Phizacklea"]}, {"page": "Phizacklea, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Phizacklea"]}]}}
