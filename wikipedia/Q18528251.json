A first prayer was conducted on 18 October. Seating was mixed and women received a growing role. On 4 February 1911, they became institutionalised upon the opening of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue at London, in which Hebrew Union College graduate Rabbi Israel Mattuck officiated. From 500 congregants, they rose to 1,500 by the end of World War I. Two other congregations in London and one in Liverpool were founded until 1928, as well as one offshoot among Mumbai's Bene Israel, headed by sisters Leah and Jerusha Jhirad. The JRU was a founding member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. It benefited to no significant extent from the great immigration of German Jewish refugees, who found it too radical and flocked to establish nonconformist synagogues of their own, eventually creating the Movement for Reform Judaism. In 1944, the JRU (which added the words \"for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism\" to its name in 1911) was reorganised as the \"Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues\". It had 11 member congregations in 1949 and continued to grow. In the postwar years, its main leader was Rabbi John D. Rayner."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Mason", "response": ["In 1890 she met Henrietta Franklin, in what others consider to be the \"inspiring experience\" of Franklin's life.

Her sister Lily Montagu led a liberal Jewish movement in Britain and in 1902 they had arranged the first meeting of the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism at Henrietta Franklin's house. Lily and Henrietta were key members of the league's all female executive. Lily would lead the meetings in prayer and she would in time become a rabbi. Henrietta achieved wider acceptance and became President of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1916."]}]}}
