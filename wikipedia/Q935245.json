Fortunately there was nobody in the car and fortunately the trams in Amsterdam are very thick so I'm not sure the driver even noticed it happen. Years later when I was feeling a bit more like a rock star than I did when I saw it happen, I was thinking about my life. It occurred to me that I was a bit like that tram when I probably ripped the side of a few things I hadn't even felt and I hadn't slowed down either and I probably hadn't noticed.

Hogarth was complimented for his vocals which had \"rarely sounded better\". In the opinion of Catherine Chambers from Kerrang! magazine, it was shocking that Anoraknophobia, conjuring up \"a pretty contemporary feel with its classy mix of blues, country, and even trip-hop stylings\" proved to be \"actually pretty damn good\" after Marillion had delivered many poorly received recordings. Stuart Maconie was more critical of the album in his review for Q magazine, awarding it just two stars out of five. He wrote: \"Steve Hogarth is way funkier than Fish but the tone is still as arch and self-important as a lower-sixth poetry mag\". He praised \"Between You and Me\", comparing it favourably with Crowded House and U2, but criticised the band for musical self-indulgence, especially on the 11-minute \"This is the 21st Century\". Maconie concluded: \"Clearly Marillion can play. If only they wouldn't play so much of it\".", "*Steve Hogarth \u2013 vocals, additional piano and percussion"]}, {"page": "Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors", "response": ["A number of the lyrical concepts on the album (most particularly, the Voice in the Crowd motif) can be heard in Marillion demo sessions released on the 1999 remaster of Clutching at Straws. These sessions were part of the writing process for Marillion's fifth studio album with Fish, which never came to fruition. Many of the musical ideas developed on those demos can be heard on Seasons End, the first Marillion album with Steve Hogarth."]}, {"page": "Music of Gibraltar", "response": ["Concerts in Gibraltar by well known international acts have recently given local acts a showcase for original material in their supporting roles.
