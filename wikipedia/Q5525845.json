This was despite having a succession of different strike partners throughout the season, including Simon Garner, Luther Blissett, David Speedie and even midfielder Gary Robson. However, when Andy Hunt arrived at Albion in March 1993, he and Taylor quickly forged a successful striking partnership that would last several seasons. Hunt and Taylor were part of the Baggies team that beat Port Vale at Wembley in the Division Two playoff final, to secure promotion to Division One. In the second half, with the game still goalless, Taylor was through on goal when he was brought down by former Leeds teammate Peter Swan. Swan's subsequent dismissal proved to be the turning point in the game, with Hunt scoring the first goal in a 3\u20130 victory."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Gary Robson||||1993\u20131996||75||3||"]}, {"page": "List of West Bromwich Albion F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Gary Robson"]}, {"page": "1993 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["|CM|| ||Gary Robson"]}, {"page": "Gary Robson", "response": ["Gary Robson is the name of:", "*Gary Robson (darts player) (born 1967), English darts player", "*Gary Robson (footballer) (born 1965), English footballer"]}]}}
