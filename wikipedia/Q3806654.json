Musicians were, James 'Bam Bam' Barker - drums, keys, percussion. Martyn Lewis - Electric guitar, backing vox. Gary Twist - bass. James played acoustic and electric guitars, mouth organ, and vocals. Produced by Paul Wetherspoon\nOne of his earlier bands, Fire Next Time,  which played up-tempo left-wing soul a la the Redskins, released a well-received album North to South on Polydor Records in 1988. The band consisted of James, Nick Muir, Ray Weston, and James O' Malley. String arrangements by Anne Dudley. Produced by Hugh Jones. O' Malley would later follow Maddock into the band Wood. Singles from the album were 'Stay With Me Now' and 'Too Close', both issued in 7\" and 12\" formats in 1988. A non album single, \"I Can't Go Back' was issued in 1987. The band on this single were James, Geoff Sapsford, James O' Malley and Martin Hughes. \nMaddock's first public success in the U.S. was with his band Wood, whose album Songs from Stamford Hill produced multiple songs appearing on the hit TV show Dawson's Creek, including the Top 5 single \"Stay You\".\nMaddock, though English, is largely associated with the Americana music style and has performed with Bruce Springsteen.
