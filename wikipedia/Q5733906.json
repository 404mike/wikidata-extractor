Prints and etchings of his best-known paintings were widely distributed by publishers such as Klackner of London, and his work is popular among collectors and dog enthusiasts today.\nDicksee belonged to an illustrious artistic family. His father was the artist John Dicksee (1817\u20131905). John's brother Thomas (1819\u20131895), also a painter, was the father of Sir Frank Dicksee (1853\u20131928), president of the Royal Academy from 1924 until his death. (Herbert, meanwhile, had one sister, whose name was Amy.) Dicksee studied art at the Slade School, London, on a scholarship. His first painting was exhibited in 1881.\nDicksee specialised in sympathetic paintings of hounds, such as \"After Chevy Chase\"[1] and \"Silent Sympathy\", but he also painted big cats at London Zoo, of which he was a fellow. His paintings were usually done from life; he kept numerous dogs as pets. Those pets featured in his etchings included a bloodhound, a French bulldog named \"Shaver\", and several pugs and bull terriers.\nMany of Dicksee's works, especially those painted during the war, depict the dogs accompanying melancholy young ladies. His most frequent model was the actress Gladys Cooper.\nThe artist married Ella Crump in 1896, and they had two children, Maurice (who was killed in World War I) and Dorothy (who also studied art). Herbert Dicksee died in 1942 in Hampstead. His daughter Dorothy was the executor of his will, which directed her to destroy most of the plates for Dicksee's etchings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1911 in art", "response": ["* Herbert Dicksee \u2013 Where's Master?"]}, {"page": "1942 in art", "response": ["* February 20 \u2013 Herbert Dicksee, English canine painter (b. 1862)"]}, {"page": "1862 in art", "response": ["* June 14 \u2013 Herbert Dicksee, English painter (died 1942)"]}, {"page": "1894 in art", "response": ["* Herbert Dicksee \u2013 Silent Sympathy"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers", "response": ["Notable members (and their date of election to a full fellowship) included: Mary Nimmo Moran (1881), William Strang (1881), Joseph Pennell (1882), Auguste Rodin (1882), Charles William Sherborn (1884), Herbert Dicksee (1885), Walter Sickert (1887), Sir David Young Cameron (1895), Margaret Kemp-Welch (1901), Sir Frank Brangwyn (1903), Anna Airy (1908), Eug\u00e8ne B\u00e9jot (1908), Ernest Stephen Lumsden (1915), William Walcot (1920), Edmund Blampied (1921), Gerald Brockhurst (1921), Robert Austin (1927), Dame Laura Knight (1932), Sir William Russell Flint (1933), Charles Tunnicliffe (1934), Geoffrey Wedgwood (1934), Joan Hassall (1948), James T.A.
