At Preston, Sedgwick started to fulfill his potential as a right midfielder under Billy Davies and was an integral part of the side that would reach the playoff final in May 2005 and semi-finals in 2006. The departure of Davies in the summer of 2006 affected the certainty of Sedgwick's place in the team and he lost his place in the starting XI to Simon Whaley as new manager Paul Simpson took charge. At the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season, Sedgwick was asked to play in central midfield, a new position for the winger, as cover for Brian O'Neil who was struggling with injury before being forced to retire. There he formed a partnership with Paul McKenna as Simpson's side picked up where Billy Davies left off, ending 2006 top of the 1st Division before finishing the season in 7th, a point off the playoffs."]}, {"page": "1985 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 June \u2013 Simon Whaley, footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bolton", "response": ["*Simon Whaley (born 1985) \u2013 Former professional footballer, Bury, Preston North End, Norwich City, Chesterfield and Doncaster RoversPlayer Profile: Simon Whaley at Soccerbase.com.
