Wymark was cast for his performance as the antiheroic businessman John Wilder in the TV dramas The Plane Makers and The Power Game; he was described in publicity material as \"John Wilder (2069 model)\". According to Anderson, Wymark's heavy drinking caused him to slur his lines: in one scene, the actor \"had to list these explanations\u00a0... and on take after take he couldn't remember that 'two' followed 'one'. We had to do it over and over again\". Anderson's biographers, Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, consider Wymark's portrayal of Webb to be the film's standout performance. The original script described Webb as a former Minister of Technology who is romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby (Norma Ronald, who had played Wilder's secretary in The Plane Makers and The Power Game)."]}]}}
