McMullen stated that \"We have relatively few extant records from the early life of Baptists in Scotland, and Wilder\u2019s carefully presented collection of Grant\u2019s writings makes a very valuable contribution to the little that is available. In this challenging volume, we have the powerful words of Peter Grant himself, some of which he preached to his people in the very midst of revival.\"", "From the foreword by Scottish professor Donald Meek \"Peter Grant, the poet, is thus well known, but Peter Grant, the preacher, is a relatively obscure figure, although his skills as an expositor have been remembered in Gaelic tradition, and his ability as a descriptive writer in English can be gauged from his reports to the Baptist Home Missionary Society. So far, however, we have not been privileged to sample the preaching style that proclaimed the Word of God, in both Gaelic and English, in the pulpit of Grantownon-Spey, and drew audiences from miles around. In this book, we are given a splendid opportunity to experience something of Peter Grant, the preacher, by means of his surviving sermons in English.\""]}, {"page": "1783 in Scotland", "response": ["* Peter Grant (P\u00e0draig Grannd nan Oran), Baptist minister and songwriter in Gaelic (died 1867)"]}]}}
