Smith was the last Governor of the united Gilbert and Ellice Islands before it was divided into Tuvalu and what later became Kiribati.\nSmith was educated at Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, University College London, and University College, Oxford. He joined the Colonial Service in 1950 and was stationed in Nigeria from 1951 to 1970. From 1970 to 1973 he was the financial secretary in the British Solomon Islands.\nIn 1973, Smith became the governor of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, succeeding John Osbaldiston Field. In 1978, Smith oversaw the granting of independence to the Ellice Islands as Tuvalu. Upon Tuvaluan independence, Smith's tenure as governor came to an end. The Gilbert Islands continued as a colony headed by governor Reginald James Wallace until 1979, which it became independent Kiribati.\nSmith donated his papers to the University of Adelaide. In 1964, he was appointed to the Order of the British Empire and the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1970. In 2009, he was appointed to membership of the Kiribati Grand Order.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of colonial governors in 1978", "response": ["**# John Hilary Smith, Governor of Gilbert and Ellice Islands (1973\u20131976) and, separately of the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu from 1976 to 1978."]}, {"page": "Subdivisions of Kiribati", "response": ["John Hilary Smith as a Governor, created the three councils of Tarawa, in 1972."]}, {"page": "South Tarawa", "response": ["At the local government level, South Tarawa has two administrative subdivisions, created by John Hilary Smith in 1972:"]}, {"page": "Betio", "response": ["Betio Post Office opened on 5 April 1957 and closed in 1964.
