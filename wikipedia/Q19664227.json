However, in 1869 he began the construction of three new Enigma class 2-4-0 locomotives there. However, it was not until the appointment of William Kirtley as locomotive superintendent in 1876 that the works were again used for new construction with further examples of Martley's Europa class 2-4-0 locomotives, Kirtley's own T class 0-6-0T and his M1, M2 and M3 class 4-4-0 express passenger locomotives. Following Kirtley's retirement in 1898 on the formation of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, Ashford became the major locomotive works for the new company, but the new Locomotive, Carriage & Wagon Superintendent H. S. Wainwright used Longhedge works for the construction of some examples of his SECR C class 0-6-0 freight locomotives in 1902\u201304. Thereafter the works was used for heavy repairs until 1911, when much of the equipment and machinery was transferred to Ashford, leaving only the capacity to undertake light repairs associated with the adjoining Stewarts Lane motive power depot."]}, {"page": "William Kirtley (railway engineer)", "response": ["William was born in  Warrington in 1840, the son of the locomotive engineer Thomas Kirtley (1810\u20131847). He was educated by his uncle Matthew Kirtley, Locomotive Superintendent of the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway and later of the Midland Railway, following his father's premature death. He served as a pupil at Derby Works from 1854\u20131860, and from 1861 to 1864 he was Running foreman for the Midland Railway for the London District. In 1864 he was appointed  superintendent of Derby Works. In 1874 he was appointed Carriage and Wagon Superintendent on the LCDR following the death of William Martley, and served until the merger to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway at the end of 1898, when he retired.

The LCDR also found the firebox expensive: some locomotives ordered in July 1860 were costed at \u00a3150 extra (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) for the Cudworth firebox with  grate; and when a revised order was prepared in February 1861, with a  grate, the firebox was costed at \u00a320 less (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) than the 1860 order. In February 1868, the LCDR's Locomotive Superintendent, William Martley, replaced the Cudworth firebox of one locomotive with a different design of coal-burning firebox (one with a brick arch and deflector plate, which had been developed by the Midland Railway), which had fewer complicated joints. In April 1869 he reported that the Cudworth type cost \u00a323-2-3d per year (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) in maintenance, whilst the type with a brick arch cost \u00a34-18-6d (equivalent to \u00a3 in ), and as a result, he gave instructions for the replacement of all Cudworth fireboxes when the locomotives next became due for heavy repairs. Between 1869 and 1876, all LCDR locomotives which had been fitted with the Cudworth firebox had these replaced by the brick-arch type, which was not only cheaper to maintain but had lower first cost."]}, {"page": "LCDR M class", "response": ["William Kirtley took over as locomotive superintendent of the railway following the death of William Martley in 1874. Martley's Europa class 2-4-0 were performing well on the lightly loaded Dover-Flushing boat trains but a larger engine was required for some of the heavier services on the main line. Kirtley therefore designed a 4-4-0 for this purpose. The six locomotives were built by Neilson and Company of Glasgow and introduced during June and July 1877.  They proved to be successful for these tasks and were only superseded on the heaviest trains by the larger  M3 class The locomotives passed to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway in 1899 and were considered to be sufficiently useful to be worth re-boilering between 1899 and 1903.
