In 1963, Stillit invented an electronic corrector (Stillitron Teaching Aid) which was first applied as a teaching tool in conjunction with mathematics, science and language textbooks, used extensively throughout the British schooling system in the 1960s. This device was the first of its kind to combine circuit-board electronics with the ability to provide students with immediate positive feedback in monitoring answers to multiple choice questions. Subsequently, the electronic corrector was developed alongside a series of language courses which sold millions of copies worldwide throughout the 1970s and 1980s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Stillitz", "response": ["Stillitz was born into a Polish-Jewish Sztyglic family (also known as Stiglitz and Shtiglitz), in Warsaw in 1903, who emigrated to East London in around 1908 to escape the Jewish pogroms during the Polish revolution. He pursued the family business of tailoring, anglicising his name in the 1920s to trade as C. Stillitz along with his brother Abraham Louis Stillitz in Hackney. In 1928 he married the sister of Sidney Rustin, founder of the Rustins paint brand, with whom he had four children, two boys and two girls. His youngest son is inventor and publisher Gerald Stillit and his youngest daughter is artist and sculptor Barbara Kulick, who was commissioned by Prince Charles to sculpt his portrait. Following the War he was naturalised as a British citizen, legally taking the name Stillitz and moving to Finchley, and later St John's Wood and then Mayfair. His elegant ladieswear business grew to be highly successful; Stillitz was a keen motorist and an avid golfer, and after the War purchased Hartsbourne Manor in Hertfordshire, transforming it into a country golf club and instigating the Gor-Ray Cup, later to be won by, among others, Malcolm Gregson and Maurice Bembridge."]}]}}
