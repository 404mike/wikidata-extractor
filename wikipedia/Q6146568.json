Born in Scotland, Arthur moved to Wales at a young age and took up boxing. He was selected to represent Wales at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester in the men's lightweight division. After winning his opening four bouts, Arthur defeated Denis Zimba in the gold medal match to become the first Welsh fighter to win gold at the games for more than 40 years.\nHe turned professional in 2003 and won his first nine bouts, but persistent cut injuries and two consecutive defeats led to his retirement in 2005. He returned to boxing in 2008 and won the Welsh area super-featherweight title in his second fight before progressing to an unsuccessful British title fight against Martin Lindsay. He competed in the Prizefighter series in May 2010 at super-bantamweight but was eliminated in the semi-final.\nIn May 2010, he won the vacant Commonwealth super-bantamweight title after defeating Kris Taylor, but lost the belt in his first defence against Jason Booth. He fought Scott Quigg in 2012 but suffered a stoppage defeat. He fought once more in 2015 before retiring, ending his career with a record of 19 wins (4 by knockout) and 6 defeats.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Jamie Arthur (born 1979)"]}, {"page": "Cwmbran", "response": ["*Jamie Arthur (born 1979) \u2013 Commonwealth Games medal winning boxer."]}, {"page": "Wales at the 2002 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["* Jamie Arthur, Boxing - Lightweight 60\u00a0kg"]}, {"page": "James Arthur (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Jamie Arthur (born 1979), Welsh boxer"]}, {"page": "Haider Ali (boxer)", "response": ["In 2005, Haider knocked undefeated prospect and 2002 Commonweight Games lightweight gold medallist Jamie Arthur out via a clash of heads.", "|align=\"left\" | Jamie Arthur"]}, {"page": "Prizefighter series", "response": ["On 29 May 2010, Prizefighter was at the York Hall once again and featured the first outing for the super-bantamweight division.  The original line-up included former WBC world bantamweight champion Wayne McCullough, former British, Commonwealth and European champion Esham Pickering, former English champion Mark Moran and unbeaten prospects Craig Lyon and Ricky Owen. Josh Wale, Chris Riley and Gavin Reid completed the line up. McCullough, Lyon and Riley withdrew in the weeks leading up to the tournament and were replaced by 2002 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Jamie Arthur, undefeated Irishman Willie Casey, and Robbie Turley.", "The opening bout between Moran and Casey was the only one to finish inside the distance. The remaining quarter-finals were all decided on split decisions with Pickering being the main casualty, being defeated by Josh Wale. In the semi-finals, Casey defeated Wale in a thrilling contest in which 532 punches were thrown in just three rounds. Owen maintained his unbeaten record with a victory over Jamie Arthur, however he was unable to progress to the final after injuries sustained in the fight. He was forced to withdraw and was replaced by young Paul McElhinney, a Scotsman who was undefeated in four fights and won a coin toss against Slough's Ian Bailey to replace Owen.

His opponent, Jamie Arthur, had won the vacant belt beating Kris Hughes after Booth had given it up in order to fight for the World title. The fight, at the Brentwood Leisure Centre, resulted in a split decision win with both fighters suffering cuts during the fight. Speaking after the fight, Booth's manager Jimmy Gill said that the fight had only been arranged with three weeks' notice and said that Jason had only just come back from holiday and so had little time to prepare. Gill said, \"Jason is 34 in November and small guys like him don't normally last that long. They burn out\". He added that he would never allow Booth to take a fight at such short notice again, saying, \"That was a favour to promoter Frank Maloney...It was a big ask but he pulled it off...But it was a one-off, I'll never do it again.\" Of the fight, Booth paid tribute to Arthur, saying, \"That was the hardest fight I've had yet...I had to show heart because I was getting out-foxed by a clever champ. For saying we had three weeks' notice, we put on a good show.\" Following the fight, it was confirmed that Booth would challenge Spain's Kiko Mart\u00ednez for the European super-bantamweight title, the fourth time Booth would have fought for a variation of the European belt. The fight against Mart\u00ednez was eventually confirmed for Spain and took place on 15 April 2011 in front of a sell out 30,000 crowd in the city of Madrid. Mart\u00ednez, a former two time European champion, won the fight in front of his home fans when in the tenth round a left hook was catalyst for the referee to call off the fight early, the first time Booth had been stopped in his career to date.This is Nottingham | Jason Booth fails in European title attempt"]}, {"page": "Scott Quigg", "response": ["On 4 February 2012, Quigg made the first defence of his title, beating the rugged veteran Jamie Arthur (18\u20135, 4 KOs) in an eighth-round stoppage, despite being put on the canvas in the fourth.", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jamie Arthur"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Jamie Arthur", "|align=left | Jamie Arthur"]}, {"page": "Chris Sanigar", "response": ["He returned to Bristol and moved into training and management at Bristol Boxing Gym, home of his former club, Empire ABC.\"BOXING: Sanigar wins ring honour\", Gazette & Herald, 19 October 2016.
