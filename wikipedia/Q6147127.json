He played in a number of games for the club, probably including their first ever fixture against Royal Ordnance. He played in the club's first FA Cup game, against Chatham Town on 12 October 1895.

For the Ironworks' initial season of 1895\u201396, a number of Old Castle Swifts players were absorbed into the newly formed team. Among them were half-backs William Morton, Walter Parks and John Woods, forwards Jamie Lindsay and George Sage, and full-back Robert Stevenson, who became the Ironworks' first ever captain. Goalkeeper David Furnell would also eventually join Thames Ironworks in 1897. The club later became West Ham United. The light blue shirts, white shorts and scarlet socks that were worn by Thames Ironworks from the 1897\u201398 season, and also by the early West Ham United team, are thought to have originated with Old Castle Swifts.", "|Jamie Lindsay"]}, {"page": "J.
