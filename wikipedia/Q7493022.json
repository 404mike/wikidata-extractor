After the first 600 metres, Bragina decided to change that, moving to the outside and running past the field at a quicker tempo.  Only long striding Berny Boxem was able to go with her as Bragina opened up a 10-metre lead on the field.  After another 300 metres, Boxem began to fade and was quickly swallowed up by the front of the pack led by Sheila Carey.  At the bell Ellen Tittel dropped out, collapsing onto the high jump apron while Bragina continued to expand her lead.  Gunhild Hoffmeister moved past Carey into second place but they all were losing ground to Bragina.  Several places back, Pigni launched into her kick, passing Burneleit, Keizer, Carey and almost catching Hoffmeister.  But Hoffmeister noticed and defended her position, battling to stay ahead.  Twice on the home stretch, with her arms flailing, Pigni looked to draw even with Hoffmeister, but each time Hoffmeister edged ahead to take the silver medal.  Not only did Bragina set a third consecutive world record, but the next four competitors behind her beat her world record from two days earlier.  Even sixth place Keizer was only .06 behind the previous record, at a time when records were only accurate to .1 of a second.", "| 3 ||align=left| Sheila Carey ||align=left|  || 4:13.01", "| 4 ||align=left| Sheila Carey ||align=left|  || 4:07.41 ||", "| 5 ||align=left| Sheila Carey ||align=left|  || 4:04.81 ||"]}, {"page": "1970 European Cup (athletics)", "response": ["| Sheila Carey||2:05.3"]}, {"page": "2013 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Sheila Carey \u2013 For services to Disability Athletics."]}, {"page": "Sheila Janet Carey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sheila Carey"]}, {"page": "1971 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  12 || Sheila Carey ||  || 11:36.6", "|align=center|  1 || align=left |  || align=left | Joyce SmithAngela LovellRita RidleySheila Carey || 29"]}, {"page": "1972 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|   7 || Sheila Carey ||  || 16:42", "|align=center|  1 || align=left |  || align=left | Joyce SmithRita RidleySheila CareyAnn Yeoman || 22"]}, {"page": "Christine Benning", "response": ["In 1978, Benning was 12th at the World Cross Country Championships in Glasgow.
