His academic background might have been botany. While working in India he was generally considered a Pathologist; this more than likely being the reason for his consistent observations of the value of compost applications being an increase in health(of the whole system). Howard was the first Westerner to document and publish the Indian techniques of sustainable agriculture. After spending considerable time learning from Indian peasants and the pests present in their soil, he called these two his professors. He was a principal figure in the early organic movement. He is considered by many in the English-speaking world to have been, along with Rudolf Steiner and Eve Balfour, one of the key advocates of ancient Indian techniques of organic agriculture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947", "response": ["* October 20 \u2013 Sir Albert Howard, English botanist and organic farming pioneer (b. 1873)"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Albert Howard (1873\u20131947), British botanist, expert on compost"]}, {"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*Albert Howard"]}, {"page": "Masanobu Fukuoka", "response": ["He visited China in 2001, and in 2002 he returned again to India to speak at the \"Nature as Teacher\" workshop at Navdanya Farm and at Bija Vidyapeeth Earth University in Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand in northern India.

The outcome of that visit was that he hosted, at his farm in Kent, the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference, the first biodynamic farming conference to be held in Britain.

Northbourne published Look to the Land in 1940, which raises many of the issues current to discussions of organic agriculture. After reading Look to the Land, the philosopher and author Marco Pallis contacted Northbourne and later introduced him to the writings of the Traditionalist (also known as Perennialist) philosophy.
