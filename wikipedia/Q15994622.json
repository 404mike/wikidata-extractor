This is not a very usual sport at present, though formerly it used to be.  The net used for the purpose is small, with a narrow opening, affixed to the end of a rod of about twelve feet in length.  The sportsman who holds it is concealed in a small cabin about five feet high, nearly in form of a bee-hive, in which there is a perpendicular slit dividing it quite in half, by which he can move his rod completely from side to side.  There are eight or nine of these cabins, in each of which perhaps, there is a sportsman with his net.  The only mode of entrance is by separating the two halves of the cabin from each other.  These receptacles are usually situated round the upper part of a raised mount.  On the outside of each there is a trained pigeon tied by the leg, and near at hand stands an attendant with another trained bird, tied in like manner to the end of a very long line, which is suffered to fly out to the whole extent of the string, the other end being held by the man.  The pigeon thus describes a considerable circle in the air round the mount beneath.  The flight of this bird, and the constant cooing of those below, attract a number of wild pigeons to the neighbourhood, when the man by checking the string calls in his pigeon, which immediately perches upon his finger.  He then conceals himself with the other attendants in a sort of alcove at the top of the mount.  The wild pigeons now approaching the tame ones, are caught in the nets by the dexterous management of the sportsmen.\"John Martin MD,Tonga Islands, fourth edition, 1981, pp.380-381"]}, {"page": "Constable's Miscellany", "response": ["|John Martin"]}]}}
