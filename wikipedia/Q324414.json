N. Sherwin-White", "response": ["Sherwin-White's Oxford career was not interrupted by his family's move in 1963 to a cottage near Fyfield, Oxfordshire. The year 1966 saw the publication of a work \"at least eighteen years\" in the making: his historical and social commentary on the letters of Pliny the Younger, the first such work ever compiled and one not yet superseded. In Millar's assessment, it \"combined immense erudition, percipience and sharpness of vision with a curious slapdashness about small details\"; these errors were keenly hunted down by contemporary reviewers. In the same year Sherwin-White became Reader in Ancient History.  Although he was a potential choice to succeed Ronald Syme as Camden Professor of Ancient History in 1970, this role went to Peter Brunt. Sherwin-White did serve as President of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies between 1974 and 1977, and his Roman Foreign Policy in the East (1983) appeared four years into his retirement. He died on 1 November 1993 at Fyfield, survived by his wife and two children."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2005", "response": ["*Peter Brunt, 88, British ancient historian."]}, {"page": "List of Oriel College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Peter Brunt \u2013 Ancient historian."]}, {"page": "1917 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Peter Brunt, ancient historian (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Camden Professor of Ancient History", "response": ["# Peter Brunt 1970\u20131982"]}, {"page": "Brunt", "response": ["*Peter Brunt, ancient historian at Oxford University"]}, {"page": "List of Brasenose College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Peter Brunt, ancient historian at Oxford University"]}, {"page": "P.A.

Cinna was ejected from the city following a bloody street fight at the Forum. He began touring Italy to recruit men, while the party of Octavius at Rome replaced him with Lucius Cornelius Merula, a priest of Jupiter, in the consulship. Cinna took control of the Roman army stationed at Nola and was joined by the exiled Marius, whose veterans flocked to their side. Octavius won the support of the two other Roman generals in the field in Italy, Metellus Pius and Pompeius Strabo, while the Samnites, who were formally at war with Rome, joined Cinna. Peter Brunt estimates that Octavius had some 60,000 men at his disposal, and Cinna twice that."]}]}}
