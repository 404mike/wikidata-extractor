From 1908 until 1910, he was assistant organist at St George's Minster, Doncaster and studied with the church's organist, Wilfrid Sanderson. Candlyn received the Bachelor of Music degree from Durham University in 1911.\nIn 1915 he was offered the position of organist and choirmaster at St. Paul\u2019s Church, Albany, New York by its rector Dr. Roelif H. Brooks and he emigrated to the United States. He was to remain at St. Paul\u2019s for twenty-eight years, with the exception of the period between September 21, 1917 and April 25, 1919 when he served with the American Expeditionary Force. On June 25, 1918 Candlyn became a United States citizen at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.During his years in Albany, Candlyn taught at the New York State College for Teachers, as Instructor from 1921 until his appointment as Assistant Professor starting with the 1935-1936 school year. He served as chair of the music department beginning in 1924 and received an honorary Doctorate of Pedagogy (Pd.D.) from the College in June 1927. Candlyn edited the compilation The Songs of New York State College for Teachers, published by H.W. Gray Company in 1923. He founded the Albany Oratorio Society and conducted the Mendelssohn Club of Albany during its 1939-1940 and 1940-1941 seasons.\nIn 1943, Dr. Brooks (who had left Albany in 1926) offered Candlyn the position of organist and choirmaster at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, New York. Candlyn worked at St. Thomas until his retirement in 1954.\nAfter his retirement from St. Thomas, Candlyn was the organist and choirmaster at Trinity Church, Roslyn, (Long Island) New York.\nT. Frederick H. Candlyn composed two hundred works, primarily anthems, cantatas, service settings and organ solos. Three of his anthems (\u201cChrist, whose glory fills the skies,\u201d \u201cThee We Adore,\u201d and \u201cKing of Glory, King of Peace\u201d) remain part of the standard repertoire of Episcopal church choirs in North America.\nCandlyn married Dorothy Ridgeway. The couple had two children: Elizabeth Candlyn and Donald Shore Candlyn, who died heroically in the Battle of the Bulge at age nineteen. He died December 16, 1964 in Point Lookout, New York. He is buried with his wife and son in the Long Island National Cemetery, Farmingdale, New York.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saint Thomas Church (Manhattan)", "response": ["*T.
