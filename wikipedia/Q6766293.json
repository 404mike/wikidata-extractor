It is around  north of Old Oxted and the circular churchyard suggests a pre-conquest origin. The oldest part of the current church is the tower, which is constructed of Bargate stone with brick battlements and which is thought to date from the 12th century. The octagonal stone font and the chancel date from the 13th century. The aisles, built partly from clunch, were added in the 14th century along with the stained glass panels in the east window, depicting the four Evangelists. The building was damaged by fires following lightning strikes in 1637 and in 1719, and the second incident resulted in the destruction of the ring of bells. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, new windows, designed by Edward Burne-Jones and Marjorie Kemp, were installed in the aisles and chancel respectively."]}, {"page": "St Machar's Cathedral", "response": ["* North aisle, window 1 - by Marjorie Kemp 1920s - Parable of the Talents", "* North aisle, window 2 - by Marjorie Kemp 1920s - Nativity as memorial to James W.
