Murphy arrived in Hobart in April 1866. He attended the First Vatican Council in 1869, and paid another visit to Rome from Hobart in 1882. In 1888, on the occasion of the golden jubilee of his priesthood, Hobart was erected into an archbishopric, and he became the first Metropolitan. Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran invested him with the pallium on 12 May 1889, and Murphy gave Moran an antique parchment scroll of the Book of Esther that he had purchased during a visit to the Holy Land. The scroll is currently held by the Veech Library at the Catholic Institute of Sydney."]}]}}
