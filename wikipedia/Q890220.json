He invariably signed his name \"B. Herschel Babbage\" and was frequently referred to as \"Herschel Babbage\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Babbage", "response": ["Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a banking partner of William Praed in founding Praed's & Co. of Fleet Street, London, in 1801. In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth. Around the age of eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in Alphington near Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever. For a short time, he attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Totnes, South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time."]}, {"page": "St Marys, South Australia", "response": ["*Benjamin Street was named by Benjamin Babbage himself in 1869 and the street's gum trees are all that remain of the native trees planted by Babbage on his estate."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Encounter Bay", "response": ["| Benjamin Babbage"]}, {"page": "Blanchewater Station", "response": ["The first European to visit to the area was Benjamin Babbage in 1856 who named the area after Governor McDonnell's wife. George Goyder then surveyed the area in 1857 and John Baker then took up a  lease and stocked the property with cattle in 1858."]}, {"page": "Eremophila behriana", "response": ["In his description of a new species, Pholidia crassifolia (now Eremophila crassifolia) in 1853, Ferdinand von Mueller indirectly described Pholidia behriana. In 1859 he formally described Eremophila Behrii from a plant collected on the 1858-1859 expedition of Benjamin Babbage. The description was published in Report on the plants collected during Mr Babbage's expedition into the north- western interior of South Australia in 1858. From the description and locations of this specimen, it is clear that he was referring to the earlier description of Pholidia behriana, so the name Eremophila behriana is now used. The specific epithet (behriana) honours the German-born Hans Hermann Behr."]}]}}
