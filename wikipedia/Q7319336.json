He was educated at Oundle School before becoming an engineering apprentice at Robey's of Lincoln. In 1924 following his apprenticeship he joined the family firm of George Wailes & Company.In 1923, while serving his apprenticeship with Robey, an engineering firm in Lincoln, he was asked by the then president of the Newcomen Society to record windmills in Lincolnshire. At the time English windmills were rapidly falling into disuse and being demolished, and it was felt that some attempt should be made to record this vanishing aspect of the English countryside. In 1929 he was appointed technical adviser to the newly formed Windmill Section (now the Mills Section) of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. In this post he visited numerous mills in England and developed a reputation as the leading British authority on them, presenting more than thirty papers to the Newcomen Society on mill-related subjects. He was also invited to report on mills overseas, notably in the United States, presenting a paper on the windmills of Long Island for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities in 1935. He was also the consultant for the construction of Robertson's post mill at Colonial Williamsburg in the 1950s.\nBooks followed, the most notable of which were Windmills in England (1948) and The English Windmill (1954), the latter in particular being considered the classic work on the subject.\nFrom 1963 to 1971 he was the lead consultant to the Industrial Monuments Survey then being undertaken by the Ministry of Works in an effort to identify historic industrial sites which were worthy of preservation under the Town and Country Planning Acts. In 1965 he represented United Kingdom at the first International Symposium of Molinology in Portugal. In 1971 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his work.He served as president of the Newcomen Society, 1953 to 1955, and was elected as an honorary member in 1977.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Industrial archaeology", "response": ["*Rex Wailes"]}, {"page": "1901 in science", "response": ["* March 6 \u2013 Rex Wailes (died 1986), English engineer and historian of technology."]}, {"page": "Newport Tower (Rhode Island)", "response": ["Godfrey initially dismissed the Chesterton Mill theory,Godfrey, Digging a Tower and Laying a Ghost, p.17, 18 claiming that \"on the other hand, there is very little probability that Benedict built his Tower as a mill... the tower mill form, as contrasted to the smock, post and composite forms, was not common in England until the beginning of the 18th century.\"Godfrey, Digging a Tower and Laying a Ghost, p.177 Godfrey posited the hypothesis that \"the tower was built as a comfortable retreat and lookout for a very rich and very autocratic old man.\"William S.

In November 2010, the mill was repainted by a team from WallWalkers, who abseiled down the mill to access the smock, as an alternative to using scaffolding to surround the mill whilst the work was undertaken."]}, {"page": "Herne Windmill", "response": ["Herne Windmill  was built by John Holman in 1789 when he was working for Sweetlove, the Wingham millwright. There are records of a windmill in Herne as early as 1405. The mill replaced an earlier post mill that was standing in 1511 and was marked on Philip Symonson's map of 1596, John Speed's map of 1611, Robert Morden's map of 1695, Emanuel Bowen's map of 1736 and Andrews, Drury and Herbert's map of 1769. In 1858, the mill was raised, and a two-storey brick base built underneath it. A new iron worm was fitted in 1931, replacing the old wooden one. In the 1930s, the mill was working on two sails only. Frank Wootton, the miller, sought the assistance of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB), and after Rex Wailes made a report on the mill, two sails from the Black Mill, Forncett End, Norfolk were fitted by Thomas Hunt of Soham, Cambridgeshire in 1936. A new pair of sails was constructed by Hunt, the work being made possible by support from SPAB, the Duchess of Kent and Trinity House. The latter assisted as the mill was marked as a navigational landmark for shipping. The mill worked by wind until 1952, assisted latterly by a steam engine, then an oil engine. After that date, milling was done with an electric motor supplying the power. Milling continued with the electric motor until 1980."]}, {"page": "Shiremark Mill, Capel", "response": ["Shiremark Mill slowly became derelict, an inspection by Rex Wailes in 1933 resulted in an estimated repair cost of \u00a3100. The cap boarding was repaired but the mill was again left to deteriorate. In 1950, Capel Parish Council approached the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and the owner of the mill with a view to securing the mill's preservation. The mill had been listed as an antiquity by Surrey County Council by 1951. In 1952, a detailed inspection of the mill found that the sills and lower part of the cant posts were rotten. Thompson's, the Alford millwrights estimated that the mill would cose \u00a32,500 to restore. The main beams of the first floor were supported by brick piers, but no other work was done. Although the mill had all four sails in 1928, the sails fell off one by one, with the last falling in 1956. Photographs show that the cap was intact in August 1958, but by May 1966 the roof had gone, exposing the brake wheel to the weather."]}, {"page": "Upthorpe Mill, Stanton", "response": ["Upthorpe Mill was built in 1751. It was originally built as an open trestle post mill. In 1818 it was moved to its present site. At some point in time the Common sails were replaced by Double Patent sails, a roundhouse later being added and a fantail fitted to turn the mill into wind automatically. The mill ended its commercial working life on a single pair of sails. It was disused by 1918 and in 1937 was becoming derelict. Rex Wailes inspected the mill on behalf of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and an appeal for funds to restore the mill was launched in 1938. In 1939, millwright Amos Clarke, along with Messrs Hunts of Soham commenced repairs which cost \u00a3600. A new side girt was fitted to the left side of the mill and the roundhouse roof was repaired. The tailstones were removed at this time. The intention was to fit the cast iron windshaft from Great Mill, Wickhambrook in place of the existing wooden windshaft and to add a new pair of sails but this work was not done owing to the outbreak of the Second World War. The mill was painted grey to reduce its conspicuousness as a landmark, as it was close to RAF Shepherds Grove. The mill was worked during the war, but ceased to be used in 1946 as it was unprofitable. By the late 1960s, the mill was again becoming derelict, and the fantail was carefully dismantled by Chris Hullcoop and Philip Lennard. In 1979, emergency repairs were carried out by Suffolk Mills Group and in 1986 the mill was bought by Richard Duke. Restoration work was carried out and the mill was able to grind again in 1990. In 1993, the mill was bought by Peter Dolman and further restoration work was carried out."]}, {"page": "Ken Major", "response": ["In 1963, Rex Wailes invited Major to assist him in carrying out a survey of mills in Berkshire.

Ashley became interested in mills after meeting Rex Wailes in 1926, the pioneer of the UK's windmill repair movement, and took photographs that were used in the books and articles published by Wailes on English windmills.
