He came to the attention of Coventry City for whom he signed professional terms in November 1969. He almost moved to Norwich in an exchange deal for their striker David Cross in 1974 but in January 1975 he did make the move to Carrow Road. While on loan in the summer of 1978 to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of NASL, he helped the Rowdies to Soccer Bowl '78. Though McGuire started the final, by the 68th minute he was forced to withdraw due to a knee injury suffered four nights earlier in the semi-final against Ft. Lauderdale. He later returned to Norwich and had further transfers to Barnsley and Oldham Athletic before moving into work with the Professional Footballers Association. He also completed an Open University degree and played some non-league football for Grantham.\nHe is married to Sue and has two children, Sally and Alexander and a grandson, Wilf, who supports Acle Rangers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Larry Lloyd", "response": ["On 15 August 1974 Coventry paid a club record transfer fee of \u00a3240,000 for Lloyd's services.

City had offered the job to Brian Clough, who said that he had been very tempted to take it, but he instead opted to remain at Derby. They started out the 1972\u201373 season with the existing squad, seeking to play in what Mercer called \"the attractive way\". But after failing to win any of the first six games, they began a series of transfers to reshape the team. Notable incoming players included Colin Stein and Tommy Hutchison, both of whom would go on to become highly popular with the supporters, while Jeff Blockley was sold to Arsenal for a club-record \u00a3200,000. The changes worked, as City went eight games unbeaten, including a 2\u20130 win at Arsenal featuring a much-lauded Hutchison goal. They also progressed to the FA Cup quarter final for the third time, but a poor performance at Wolverhampton Wanderers ended that run. League form also suffered and the club finished 19th. The following season started brightly, and wins at home to Liverpool, Manchester City and Derby put City in the top five after ten games. They progressed to the quarter-final of the League Cup and the fifth round of the FA Cup, but suffered narrow defeats in both. The league ended disappointingly again with a 16th-place finish. The club were plunged into financial difficulties in 1974. They purchased Larry Lloyd from Tottenham for \u00a3240,000, with Mick McGuire and Jimmy Holmes due to be sold in the other direction for \u00a3200,000, but the latter deal fell through after the former was already completed and Coventry faced a huge deficit. Derrick Robins left the club in April 1975 due a relocation to South Africa, ending a fifteen-year career at the helm which had transformed the club's history. Joe Mercer left his management position to become a club director at the same time, leaving Milne in sole charge of the team. On the field it was an indifferent season, with patchy league form and an early exit from both cups."]}, {"page": "Mickey McGuire", "response": ["Mickey or Mick McGuire may refer to:", "*Mick McGuire (born 1952), title character of traditional Irish folk song"]}, {"page": "Operation Glade", "response": ["# the former football executive Mick McGuire,"]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players", "response": ["|Mick McGuire"]}, {"page": "Soccer Bowl '78", "response": ["|MF ||13 || Mick McGuire|| || "]}, {"page": "Michael James McGuire", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mick McGuire"]}, {"page": "Mick McGuire (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mick McGuire"]}]}}
