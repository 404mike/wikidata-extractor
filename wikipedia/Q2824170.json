Just before half time, England led 21\u20130 through tries from Andrew Harriman, Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber, all converted by Nick Beal. Michael Lynagh scored a try before half time, but failed to convert his own try. In the second half Australia hit back strongly and first David Campese and then Semi Taupeaafe scored further tries, the latter also converted by Michael Lynagh. However, time ran out on the Australians and it was England captain \"Prince\" Andrew Harriman who was presented with the Melrose Cup by the Princess Royal.  Adedayo Adebayo, a member of that victorious side later recalled how surprising the victory had been to the players involved in it. He said \"We were basically a scratch side. We got together for the first time as a team the week before, played one practice match and went on to win! But there were a lot of quality players in that side and looking back that's why we were able to wing it slightly \u2013 the talent came through. Looking back though we had no expectations of winning at the start. We didn't know how far we would go.

Only a Bath knock-on during the drive prevented a repeat of the first game and an early try for the experts. What this meant though was the Wigan pack engaging in a union scrum early on, and coming to terms with the differences of this compared with a typically uncontested scrum in their own game. Indeed, it was through scrummaging inexperience that Wigan conceded their first try, a penalty try given through their repeated collapsing of the scrum. It was 18 minutes until Wigan handled the ball in the opposition half, with Bath gaining further tries through Adedayo Adebayo (2) and Jon Sleightholme prior to half-time, allowing the Courage League champions to build an unanswered 25-point lead at the break. Jonathan Davies, the dual-code international, made the observation that Wigan were suffering from constant infringements of \"rules they didn't know existed\".", "|LC ||12|| Adedayo Adebayo", "Although Bath were evidently outmatched in the first game, they were able to take some positives; Phil de Glanville made the most tackles of any back on either side, while de Glanville, Steve Ojomoh, Jon Callard and Adedayo Adebayo all impressed watching league experts. Similarly, in the second game, as Bath tired, Wigan were able to exploit both their superior fitness and their superior running game to gain a foothold during the second half. However, one of Bath's star players at the time, England centre Jeremy Guscott, refused to play in the series, as he felt that there was a lack of balance between the two games - the only alteration that took place in the league fixture came at half-time when Bath requested unlimited substitutions (rather than the fixed number of ten interchanges normally permitted); apart from this, the match was played as a standard, full intensity game of rugby league. In the union fixture however, although there was a greater intensity to the scrummaging than league players would normally experience, the scrums were not fully contested, as scrummaging in rugby union is highly technical, particularly in the front row. Had the scrums been fully contested, Guscott stated that it was likely a number of the Wigan forwards could have been seriously injured. But, this meant that Wigan were able to gain more of a foothold in the union fixture than Bath had been able to do in the league fixture."]}, {"page": "1998 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Adedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "1993 England rugby union tour of Canada", "response": ["*Adedayo Adebayo (Bath)"]}, {"page": "Adedayo", "response": ["*Adedayo Adebayo (born 1970), Nigerian rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Adebayo, Adedayo", "response": ["#redirectAdedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Pilkington Cup", "response": ["| ||11|| Adedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Pilkington Cup", "response": ["| ||11|| Adedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Pilkington Cup", "response": ["| ||11|| Adedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Pilkington Cup", "response": ["| ||12|| Adedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens squads", "response": ["# Adedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens squads", "response": ["# Adedayo Adebayo"]}, {"page": "Leicester Tigers in cup finals", "response": ["| ||11|| Adedayo Adebayo", "| ||12|| Adedayo Adebayo"]}]}}
