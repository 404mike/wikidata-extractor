In this it drew upon a longstanding tradition of Cuban nationalism. Castro biographer Sebastian Balfour noted that \"the vein of moral regeneration and voluntarism that runs through\" Castro's thought owes far more to \"Hispanic nationalism\" than European socialism or Marxism\u2013Leninism. Historian Richard Gott remarked that one of the keys to Castro's success was his ability to use the \"twin themes of socialism and nationalism\" and keep them \"endlessly in play\". Castro described Karl Marx and Cuban nationalist Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed as his main political influences, although Gott believed that Mart\u00ed ultimately remained more important than Marx in Castro's politics. Castro described Mart\u00ed's political ideas as \"a philosophy of independence and an exceptional humanistic philosophy\", and his supporters and apologists repeatedly claimed that there were great similarities between the two figures."]}, {"page": "Spanish use of chemical weapons in the Rif War", "response": ["The Spanish bombings were covered up but some observers of military aviation, like Pedro Tonda Bueno in his autobiography La vida y yo (Life and I), published in 1974, talked about dropping toxic gases from airplanes and the consequent poisoning of the Rif fields.  Likewise, Spanish Army air arm pilot Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, in his autobiographical work Cambio de rumbo (Course change), reveals how he witnessed several chemical attacks.  Years later, in 1990, two German journalists and investigators, Rudibert Kunz and Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller, in their work Giftgas gegen Abd El Krim: Deutschland, Spanien und der Gaskrieg in Spanisch-Marokko, 1922-1927 (Poison Gas against Abd El Krim: Germany, Spain and the Gas War in Spanish Morocco, 1922-1927), proved with scientific tests that chemical attacks had indeed occurred.  The British historian Sebastian Balfour, of the London School of Economics, in his book Deadly Embrace, confirmed massive use of chemical arms after having studied numerous Spanish, French and British archives.  According to his research, the strategy of the Spanish military was to choose highly populated zones as targets.  Additional evidence is found in a telegram from a British official, H. Pughe Lloyd,  sent to the British Minister of War.", "According to Sebastian Balfour, the motivation for the chemical attacks was based primarily on revenge for the defeat of the Spanish Army of Africa and their Moroccan recruits the RegularesVolunteer infantry and cavalry units of the Spanish Army recruited in Spanish Morocco. These Moroccan troops played a major role in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) at the Battle of Annual on July 22, 1921."]}, {"page": "Spain: A History", "response": ["The book is a compilation of essays on Spanish history over the long-term, with contributions by Sebastian Balfour, Roger Collins, A.

The extreme nationalism and anti-democratic views enabled a potential linkage with Fascism. According to Sebastian Balfour, africanist practices, intertwined with ideas on the \"degeneration\" of the Spanish masses, would become a core tenet of the ideology of \"crusade\" present in the 1936 coup d'etat."]}, {"page": "Revisionism (Spain)", "response": ["Until the late 1990s in Spain the term revisionismo hist\u00f3rico was applied to various historiographic debates abroad, often though not always related to Nazism.see e.g. ABC 17.11.98, available here It was seldom used against the local background and its denotation could have varied, e.g. in 1988 the expression was employed to stand for scientific historiography. Carlos Seco, Un an\u00e1lisis objetivo del r\u00e9gimen de Franco, [in:] El Pa\u00eds 23.07.88, available here According to scholars who later confronted revisionism, this general setting changed in the mid-1990s; the new government of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar launched a bid to revise the dominant historiographic view of the recent past. Giovanni C. Cattini, Historical revisionism. The reinterpretation of history in contemporary political debate, [in:] Transfer 06 (2011), p. 32, and many other similar claims made by other authors. Also historians who try to stay neutral in the revisionist-antirevisionist debate and strive to take equidistant position versus both camps adhere to the view that Aznar's government intended to impose a right-wing historiographical perspective, see e.g. Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez, Memory and Cultural History of the Spanish Civil War, Boston 2014, , pp. 31, 38.  In administrative terms the scheme was embodied e.g. other initiative supposed to derail public discourse was setting up FAES, Fabian Altem\u00f6ller, Die spanische extreme Rechte zwischen Metapolitik und Politik: Eine Analyse der Situierung der Nueva Derecha und der Adaption der Nouvelle Droite, Berlin 2017, , p. 212, Xos\u00e9-Manoel N\u00fa\u00f1ez Seixas, Andreas Stucki, Neueste Entwicklungen und Tendenzen der postdiktatorischen Geschichtskultur in Spanien, [in:] Stefan Troebst, Susan Baumgartl (eds.), Postdiktatorische Geschichtskulturen im S\u00fcden und Osten Europas, G\u00f6ttingen 2010, , p. 216, Xos\u00e9-Manoel N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Ein endloser Erinnerungskrieg?

Cattini 2011, p. 32 In parallel the Right-wing administration mounted a public-discourse counter-offensive,apart from FAES, its vehicles were the radio broadcat station COPE, electronic bulletin Libertad Digital and privately held popular dailies ABC and El Mundo, Sebastian Balfour, El revisionismo hist\u00f3rico y la Guerra Civil, [in:] Pasajes: Revista de pensamiento contempor\u00e1neo 19 (2006), p. 61 which climaxed in \"Operaci\u00f3n Moa\". Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez Calleja, La historiograf\u00eda sobre la violencia pol\u00edtica en la Segunda Rep\u00fablica espa\u00f1ola: una reconsideraci\u00f3n, [in:] Hispania Nova 11 (2013), p. 26 Its supposed result was commercial success of 3 books the most popular of them, Los mitos de la guerra civil, sold at least in 300,000 copies in Spain, see here. The result was typical for best-selling novels rather than for historiographic works, the latter sold at best in tens of thousands of copies. Mitos was also translated into a number of foreign languages and re-published in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2014 and 2018 which appeared on the market between 1999 and 2003; written by an amateur historian and far-right propagandist Pio Moa, they focused on the Second Republic and the Civil War. titled Los or\u00edgenes de la guerra civil espa\u00f1ola (1999), Los personajes de la Rep\u00fablica vistos por ellos mismos (2000) and especially Los mitos de la guerra civil (2003)", "Instead of dying out, after 2005 the debate on revisionism flamed on and was brought to another level. To some extent sustained by adoption of Ley de la Memoria Historica in 2007, Enrique Moradiellos, Revisi\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica cr\u00edtica y pseudo-revisionismo pol\u00edtico presntista: el caso de la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola, Badajoz 2011, p. 13. The law triggered another historiographic protest manifesto, titled Manifiesto por la Verdad Hist\u00f3rica and signed among others by Federico Jim\u00e9nez, C\u00e9sar Vidal, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Marco, Pedro Schwartz, Ricardo de la Cierva and Jes\u00fas Palacios, Montesinos 2007, p. 55 the discussion transformed when a group of professional historians challenged the anti-revisionists; from that moment onwards the conflict was no longer between amateurs\"aparte de Stanley Payne, no les respald\u00f3 ning\u00fan historiador profesional importante\", Malefakis 2011 and scholars, but between the scholars themselves. It reached another milestone in 2010-2011, the years when Manuel \u00c1lvarez Tard\u00edo and Roberto Villa Garc\u00eda published a general work on the Second Republic and when RAH-edited Diccionario Biogr\u00e1fico Espa\u00f1ol published a biography of Francisco Franco. some scholars claim that publication of the biogram exposed \"the limits of post-Francoist democratization\", Chris Ealham, The Emperor's New Clothes: 'Objectivity' and Revisionism in Spanish History, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 48/1 (2012), p. 192 The latter caused heated controversy mostly in popular discourse; according to many, the biography was revisionist and scandalous. The former had a low-profile but more lasting effect, and became a negative point of reference for many works confronting revisionist historiography.especially the 2012 volume En el combate por la historia, edited by Angel Vi\u00f1as, see Ealham 2012, pp. 193-194, Peter Anderson, Knowing and Acknowledging Spain\u2019s Dark Civil War Past, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), p. 135 The discussion on revisionism kept escalating and assumed increasingly militant tone. The next milestone was reached when in 2014 Stanley G. Payne published his biography of Franco (co-authored by Jes\u00fas Palacios Tapias); at that point some concluded that revisionism was embraced by the world's most distinguished Hispanists.even junior students with no previous scientific contribution do not hesitate to assert that since the late 1990s Payne's \"credibility started to decline\", that he turned into \"almost an apologist of the Franco regime\", that his stature \"has plummeted from a respectful and significant historian to an almost apologist\", and that due to his \"propaganda-like work\" Payne \"has no objectivity\"; the MA hopeful then proceeds to lecture Payne and other scholars how a properly written historiographic work should look like, Ascenett Martinez-Lopez, The Spanish Predisposition. Biases within the Historiography and Memory of the Spanish Civil War [MA thesis University of Newcastle], Newcastle 2017, pp. 8 and passim. The thesis was supervised by one of the anti-revisionists, Alejandro Quiroga Since then the debate has reached an unprecedented level and spilled over to global historiography.the debate on revisionism was taken up mostly by British and American scholars, compare contributions of Peter Anderson, Sebastian Balfour, Gerard Blaney Jr., Cathie Carmichael, Chris Ealham, Helen Graham, Stanley G. Payne, Samuel Pierce, Paul Preston, Tim Rees, Michael Richards, Richard A. Robinson, Michael Seidman, Robert Stradling, Nigel Townson and Mary Vincent, see e.g. sections in Journal of Contemporary History or European History Quarterly in issues from 2006 to 2017. Beyond the English-speaking world the topic is barely present though noticed, see especially Fabian Altem\u00f6ller, Die spanische extreme Rechte zwischen Metapolitik und Politik, Berlin 2017, , and Gabriele Ranzato, Il passato di bronzo: L'eredit\u00e0 della guerra civile nella Spagna democratica, Bari 2014,  It is also reflected in 2018 debates related to proposal of a new Ley de Memoria Hist\u00f3rica.for the draft version of the law see here. The authors claim that new regulations are \"moral duty\" towards victims of the war and Francoism. The opponents claim that the proposal advances \"soviet-style regulations\". Many revisionist authors (Payne, Martin Rubio, Palacios, Togores, Seidman, Gonzalez Cuevas, Moa) signed a protest letter against the draft, see La Gaceta 15.03.2018, available here ", "The revisionist authors are \"in the service of the political aims of the present\", Ealham 2007, p. 367; \"perhaps it would be more \u2018honest\u2019 if would-be \u2018objective\u2019 historians came clean about their political agenda\", Ealham 2012, p. 197 their goal identified as to \"whitewash the history of the Spanish right\" Ealham 2012, p. 202 and to cover up Nationalist crimes. the intention to cover up Nationalist crimes is posed as attempt not to \"re-open the wounds\", Robledo 2015, p. 2; the same declaration is held tantamount to refusal to investigate, incompatible with historian\u2019s craft, Anderson 2017, p. 130, Maria Thomas, Political Violence in the Republican Zone of Spain during the Spanish Civil War: Evolving Historiographical Perspectives, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), p. 147 They are linked to a range of political options and might be dubbed \"historiographic Right\", Javier Rodrigo, Los mitos de la derecha historiogr\u00e1flca.

Ealham [ongoing], p. 1 They are charged with exalting \"pure Francoism\", Robledo 2015, p. 5 sustaining \"canon neofranquista\", \"peddling discredited historical narrative\", Ealham 2007, p. 367 \"repackaging the legends of Francoist \u2018historiography\u2019\", Ealham 2007, pp. 367-368 serving \"re-fried Francoist fables\", \"almost 'Blue'\" myths Ealham 2007, p. 365 and even nurturing \"filonazismo\".the charge of nurturing \"filonazismo\" is perhaps the most far-reaching one presented in the scholarly realm (anonymous cyberspace excluding). It was put forward by Xos\u00e9 Manoel N\u00fa\u00f1ez Seixas, Los vencedores vencidos: la peculiar memoria de la Dvisi\u00f3n Azul, 1945-2005, [in:] Pasado y memoria: Revista de historia contempor\u00e1nea 4 (2005), p. 96. Perhaps to avoid legal action, the charge was addressed to an unnamed group of \"young historians\" The charges are supposed proven by political membership of some historians, revisionists are even more damned as the parties they engage have reportedly never condemned Francoism, Robledo 2014, p. 80 their publications in right-wing periodicals Robledo 2015, p. 5, Ealham 2012, p. 198, Robledo 2014, p. 79 or publishing houses, like Editorial Encuentro links to right-wing institutions, for FAES see Robledo 2015, p. 2, Robledo 2014, p. 79, for RAH as \"thoroughly undemocratic\" institution \"unrepresentative of Spanish historical profession\", see Ealham 2012, p. 192 their set of \"ideological bedmates\" Chris Ealham, The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes: \u2018Objectivity\u2019 and Revisionism in Spanish History, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 48/1 (2013), p. 192 or who they dined with. see e.g. comments on Payne dining with Moa, Robledo 2015, p. 6 Authoritarian sentiments might be suggested also by other associations, e.g. in case of Payne it was noted he is based in Wisconsin, the home state of senator McCarthy. At times their presence in public discourse is cast against the background of Holocaust denial and revisionism being punishable by law in countries like Germany.Sebastian Balfour, The concept of historical revisionism: Spain since the 1930s, [in:] International Journal of Iberian Studies 21/3 (2008), pp. 179-18 Sevillano Calero 2007, p. 187, Richard J. Evans, Debate \u2013 Public Memory, Political Violence and the Spanish Civil War, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), p. 118. While scholarly periodicals maintain some restraint, in some popular media a thesis that the Spanish revisionists are Holocaust-deniers is advanced almost openly, compare \"\u201eperpetran en Espa\u00f1a algunos historiadores de mentira que de un tiempo a esta parte publican con \u00e9xito versiones actualizadas de los infundios de la propaganda franquista; o lo de quienes, digamos, aseguran que Auschwitz fue en realidad un balneario con fines ben\u00e9ficos\u201d, Javier Cercas, Revisar la revision, [in:] El Pa\u00eds 31.05.07", "Sebastian BalfourSebastian Balfour, El revisionismo hist\u00f3rico y la Guerra Civil, [in:] Pasajes: Revista de pensamiento contempor\u00e1neo 19 (2006), pp. 61-65"]}, {"page": "Iron surgeon", "response": ["The iron surgeon could be understood as a Spanish version of the Nitzschean ubermensche, and was a product of Costa's disenfranchisement with the political system of the Restoration and his progressive political radicalization.
