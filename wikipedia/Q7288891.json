England won the Second Test by 256 runs despite play being held up by a riot, but May suffered an internal injury and had to go to hospital every morning before play.

Kent won the match by 29 runs. Laker bowled a total of 54 overs in the match and that immediately followed a haul of 63 overs in a match against Glamorgan at Swansea, which Surrey won. It seems that Laker's spinning finger was definitely suffering from \"wear and tear\" at the time and this probably reduced his effectiveness. His colleagues held differing views about the matter. Peter Loader said May was completely out of order while Micky Stewart suggested that May should have been aware that \"Jim was knackered\". Godfrey Evans, who played for Kent in the match, said that Laker was \"ill-supported by May\". Raman Subba Row blamed May for his \"management style\" which was not at all people-oriented, unlike that of Stuart Surridge, May's predecessor as Surrey captain, who was a \"people person\" and \"down to earth\".

The alternative opener was Willie Watson\u2014who replaced Ted Dexter\u2014but he had made 141 batting at number 6 against Victoria and May wanted to keep him in the lower-middle order. Peter Loader had a groin strain that had kept him out of the New South Wales game, but the great shock was that the off-spinner Jim Laker, England's best bowler, could not play because his arthritic spinning finger was immobile. As a result, Frank Tyson was recalled after two years out of the team, having had taken 3/40 and 4/55 in the last two matches. Godfrey Evans replaced Roy Swetman as wicket-keeper even though his broken middle finger had not fully mended as the young Surrey keeper had proved fallible behind the stumps. As a result, May had four fast bowlers and only one spinner on a pitch that was traditionally a good batting surface with low bounce, though the South Australia game at Christmas had seen a green, pacey wicket. This was the only Test in which the three great England fast bowlers of the 1950s Tyson, Trueman and Statham all played together.
