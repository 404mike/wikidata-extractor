On his arrival at The Dell, with money available for new players, Parker set about building a side to push for promotion from Division 2. Over two seasons he spent \u00a39,000 on new players, bringing in wingers Harry Osman and Billy Bevis, goalkeeper Sam Warhurst and centre-half Bill Dodgin. The most important signing, however, was when he signed Ted Bates from his former club Norwich City. Bates was later to go on to transform Southampton into a First Division team."]}, {"page": "Terry Paine", "response": ["Paine worked as a coach-builder at Eastleigh's British Railways depot, and played his early football for his local club, Winchester City and featured in their Amateur Cup run in 1956\u201357. He had trials at both Portsmouth and Arsenal (for whom he scored twice in a trial match) but Winchester's manager was former Saints player Harry Osman who alerted Ted Bates to Paine's potential and in August 1956, the Football Echo reported \"Terry Paine, a Winchester City forward, in whom Arsenal were interested has been added to the playing staff list.\""]}, {"page": "Fred Briggs (footballer)", "response": ["In May 1938, he was signed on a free transfer by Second Division Southampton. Manager Tom Parker saw him as the ideal player to pair with Harry Osman up front. Briggs made his first start on 24 September 1938 in a defeat at Newcastle United, but soon settled into the side, forming a \"useful partnership\" with centre-forward Reg Tomlinson. In a run of twelve matches from mid-October to Christmas, he scored ten goals including a hat-trick at home to Swansea Town on 26 November. By the end of the season he was the Saints' top scorer with 14 goals."]}, {"page": "List of Southampton F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Harry Osman", "|Harry Osman"]}, {"page": "Lawrence Wallace", "response": ["He made his first-team debut at Maine Road against Manchester City on 18 March 1939, in place of Harry Osman, who had been sold to Millwall.

Bob Hewison signed Williams as an amateur in July 1937 from Eastville United for Bristol City. During the Second World War Williams represented Northern Command and guested for Darlington. He turned professional with Bristol City in July 1945. Williams made his debut in Third Division South replacing Jack Hargreaves on the left wing in a 4\u20130 win v Bristol Rovers on 1 February 1947. He made 13 appearances and scored 3 goals, all in the space of 4 matches in April 1947, as Bristol City finished 3rd in 1946\u201347. Williams began the following season 1947\u201348 at outside left but was replaced in October 1947 when 36-year-old Harry Osman was signed from Millwall. Williams ended the season with a run of games at outside right and made 28 appearances scoring 2 goals. Williams made only 13 appearances scoring 1 goal in 1948-49 as the \"Robins\" searched for a regular left winger to partner inside left Vic Barney newly signed from Reading. Bristol City continued to languish in the lower part of the Third Division South in 1949-50 finishing 15th with Williams starting the season at outside right and finishing on the left wing making 17 appearances scoring 3 goals. Williams did score both goals in a 2-0 Gloucestershire Cup win over Bristol Rovers. In 1950-51 Williams reclaimed the left wing position from Tommy Rudkin at the outset but then lost the shirt when Jack Boxley was signed from Stourbridge in October 1950. He made 25 appearances scoring 2 goals but played in all 5 FA Cup ties as Bristol City reached the 5th round eventually losing 2\u20130 to Birmingham City. In his final season 1951-52 Williams made only 4 appearances without scoring then joined local South Gloucestershire team Stonehouse in June 1952 who were managed by former Bristol City man Bill Thomas. After his playing career ended Williams became a self-employed decorator before retiring in December 1984 when he was living in Patchway near Bristol."]}, {"page": "Fred Smallwood", "response": ["In the summer of 1937, he was injured in a pre-season warm-up match and lost his place to Harry Osman.

He played regularly in the reserve team during his five years with the Saints, but his first-team debut came on 7 September 1936 when he replaced Billy Kingdon for a 1\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers. He made only one further appearance in 1936\u201337 and three the following season, once at left-half and twice at outside-left over the Christmas period (both draws against Swansea Town) in place of Harry Osman, who had switched to the inside-left in the absence of Arthur Holt.
