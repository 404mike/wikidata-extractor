Eastleigh brought many a fan to Clarence Park with drums and all, and they took the lead when former Saint Matt Hann went down in the box and Eastleigh converted the penalty. The Eastleigh fans went wild, and they maintained the lead and their singing voices until half time. In the second half city loanee Bradley Gray equalised with a shot from the edge of the area that squeezed inside the post, before Akanni-Sunday Wasiu put City ahead moments later. By now the City fans were going crazy, and the result seemed beyond doubt when Sunday completed his brace. Another former Saint, Steve Watts, scored a great effort but City survive in both the game and the lead."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Leyton Orient F.C. season", "response": ["|Bradley Gray"]}]}}
