He presented the BBC One chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross during the 2000s, hosted his own radio show on BBC Radio 2 from 1999 to 2010, and served as film critic and presenter of the Film programme.

Over the next decade, he had several radio and television roles, many through his own production company, Channel X. In 1995, he sold his stake in Channel X, and embarked on a career with the BBC. In 1999, Ross took over presenting the Film programme from Barry Norman, and also began presenting his own radio show, while two years later he began hosting Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. For the chat show, Ross won three BAFTA awards for Best Entertainment Performance, in 2004, 2006 and 2007. By 2006, he was believed to be the BBC's highest-paid star.\nIn 2005, Ross was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to broadcasting.

The Cadillac hearse used in the film is now privately owned in central California and is preserved, looking essentially identical to the way it did in the film. Only one Jaguar \"hearse\" was built and was destroyed as part of the film's storyline.

There may not even be a mystery.\" Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: \"Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or perhaps these things are the non-sequiturs and subconscious of dreams.\" Philip French from The Observer sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the BBC rejects the theory of Betty's life as Diane's dream, but also warns against too much analysis."]}, {"page": "November 17", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 Jonathan Ross, English actor and talk show host"]}, {"page": "Spider-Man", "response": ["In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): \"Stan Lee thought the name up.
