Known as \"Willie\" to his family, he had likely began his interest in the game of baseball while still in his hometown of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, considering there were at least nine amateur baseball clubs organized and playing there during the early 1870s.  Canadian journalist Peter McGuire claims the Phillips family moved from Saint John in 1877, due to a major fire, which burned much of the city.
