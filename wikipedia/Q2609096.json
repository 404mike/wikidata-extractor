The role of Susanna in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro was written for and first performed by her.\nBorn in London, her singing career as a child prodigy began in England by the age of 12.  This led to further study in Italy and to a successful singing career there during the late 1770s.  While in Monza (or shortly before in Milan) in 1782, she was recruited to form part of Emperor Joseph II's new Italian opera company in Vienna, where the assembled singers who joined her \"created in the two years leading up to the premiere of The Marriage of Figaro, were welded into the finest buffa ensemble anywhere.\"In Vienna, she befriended both Mozart and Joseph Haydn. A sudden failure of her voice in 1785 caused her to withdraw from the stage for five months; though her career continued to be successful, she never fully recovered her former vocal prowess. After marrying in 1784, she left Vienna in 1787 and returned to London, where she continued her career, notably singing in her brother Stephen Storace's operas. She remained in London, but by 1808 had retired from the stage. She died in 1817.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antonio Salieri", "response": ["However, there is also evidence attesting to the fact that Mozart and Salieri sometimes appeared to support each other's work. For example, when Salieri was appointed Kapellmeister in 1788, he chose to revive Figaro instead of introducing a new opera of his own, and when he attended the coronation festivities for Leopold II in 1790, Salieri had no fewer than three Mozart masses in his luggage. Salieri and Mozart even jointly composed a cantata for voice and piano, Per la ricuperata salute di Ofelia, which celebrated the return to the stage of the singer Nancy Storace.

In his last surviving letter from 14 October 1791, Mozart told his wife that he had picked up Salieri and Caterina Cavalieri in his carriage and driven them both to the opera; about Salieri's attendance at his opera The Magic Flute, speaking enthusiastically: \"He heard and saw with all his attention, and from the overture to the last choir there was not a piece that didn't elicit a 'Bravo!' or 'Bello!' out of him [...].\"Solomon, Maynard, Mozart: A Life, Harper Perennial (1996)"]}, {"page": "October 27", "response": ["*1765 \u2013 Nancy Storace, English soprano (d. 1817)"]}, {"page": "The Marriage of Figaro", "response": ["|Susanna, the countess's maid||soprano||Nancy Storace"]}, {"page": "Hayes, Hillingdon", "response": ["* Composer Stephen Storace (1762\u20131796), famous in his day and a friend of Mozart, lived from the late 1780s in Wood End, Hayes.

The cast included John Braham, whose long-time companion Nancy Storace had been the first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro in Vienna. However, as it was only played once, it does not appear to have attracted much interest. As far as can be gathered, it was not staged in London again until at the St Pancras Festival in 1957. The first performance at La Scala in Milan was on 26 December 1818. The North American premiere was staged on 4 August 1952 at the Berkshire Music Center in Tanglewood. For a long time, Mozart scholars regarded Tito as an inferior effort of the composer. Alfred Einstein in 1945 wrote that it was \"customary to speak disparagingly of La clemenza di Tito and to dismiss it as the product of haste and fatigue\", and he continues the disparagement to some extent by condemning the characters as puppets \u2013 e.g., \"Tito is nothing but a mere puppet representing magnanimity\" \u2013 and claiming that the opera seria was already a moribund form.Einstein, A. Mozart: His Character, His Work, NY: Oxford University Press, 1945, pp. 408\u201311 However, in recent years the opera has undergone something of a reappraisal.
