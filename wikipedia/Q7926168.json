Some Gaitskellites (including the later founders of the Social Democratic Party), were favourable to British involvement. Labour later moved from its opposition towards the European Community and began to support membership. Important groups of Conservatives also opposed joining the Common Market. One of the earliest groups formed against British involvement in Europe was the Conservative Party-based Anti-Common Market League, whose president Victor Montagu declared that opponents of the Common Market did not want to \"subject [themselves] to a lot of frogs and huns\". Conversely, much of the opposition to Britain's EU membership came from Labour politicians and trade unionists who feared bloc membership would impede socialist policies, although this was never the universal Labour Party opinion. In 2002, a minority of Labour MPs, and others such as Denis Healey, formed the Labour Against the Euro group in 2002, opposing British membership of the single currency.\"Labour MPs launch anti-euro drive\", BBC News, 10 April 2002 The Trades Union Congress remains strongly pro-EU.Patrick Wintour \"TUC accuses Tory Eurosceptics of trying to undermine labour law\", The Guardian, 16 January 2013"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|Victor Montagu"]}, {"page": "Guy Barnett (British politician)", "response": ["After unsuccessfully contesting Scarborough and Whitby in 1959, Barnett was elected as the MP for South Dorset at a by-election in November 1962  after the sitting Conservative MP Victor Montagu succeeded to the peerage as the Earl of Sandwich.
