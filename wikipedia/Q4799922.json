The family migrated to Australia in 1852, arriving in Melbourne that Christmas. Martin was educated at St Mark's School, Fitzroy and later matriculated at the University of Melbourne in February 1868.\nMartin worked in the post office from 1865 to 1883; however he was also a casual writer in this period. Having established the Melbourne Review with Henry Gyles Turner in 1876, Martin edited the publication for six years. Martin was a member of the Eclectic Association, fellow members included Theodore Fink, Arthur Topp, Alfred Deakin and David Mickle.In 1883 Martin moved to London amid controversy in a divorce case; he became a journalist and wrote regularly for the Pall Mall Gazette. Martin was the satirist of the 'Australasian Group' - who regarded themselves as exiles - but retained an interest in Australian literature and other affairs. \nOne of Martin's most solid achievements was the publication of a work entitled \"Australia and the Empire\", specially dedicated to the First Lord of the Treasury, Mr. Balfour. The opening essay in this work, entitled \"Robert Lowe in Sydney,\" formed the nucleus of the undertaking on which Martin later worked on\u2014the complete political biography of Lord Sherbrooke. Among other literary efforts in London may be mentioned \"Oak-bough and Wattle-blossom,\" the first of those collective stories by \"Australians in England\" of which there are now quite a series. \"Over-the-Sea Stories for the Children of Two Worlds\" a profusely illustrated gift-book, is also a collection by Martin.\nMartin married a widow, Harriette Anne Bullen (daughter of Dr John Moore Cookesley) on 11 January 1886 in London. Together they wrote verse and organised the publications of expatriate Australians in various periodicals.\nMartin's health deteriorated and he moved to Tenerife, Canary Islands where he died on 15 February 1902.\nA sister, Letitia Hill Martin, who was also an accomplished writer, married the theatrical impresario Arthur Garner.", "link_mentions": {}}}
