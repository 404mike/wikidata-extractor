Representing Manchester United, he played in the 1956 and 1957 Football League championship-winning teams.\nKnown for his pace and agility, Wood had the opportunity to be a professional sprinter, but opted instead to play football. He played for England at international level on three occasions between 1954 and 1956 and, after retiring from playing in 1968, managed football clubs in the US, Cyprus, Greece, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Charlton", "response": ["Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 away win over Charlton Athletic in February. United won the league championship but were denied the 20th century's first \"double\" when they controversially lost the 1957 FA Cup Final to Aston Villa. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper Ray Wood carried off with a broken cheekbone after a clash with Villa centre forward Peter McParland. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate Jackie Blanchflower who ended up between the posts."]}, {"page": "Munich air disaster", "response": ["*Ray Wood (died 2002)", "Martin Edwards was criticised for turning the match into a publicity stunt, while Elizabeth Wood, the divorced wife of Munich survivor Ray Wood, compared the treatment of the Munich victims to that of \"dancing bears at the circus\". Nevertheless, the match earned \u00a347,000 for each of the victims' families, while Eric Cantona recouped over \u00a390,000 in expenses directly from the testimonial fund, rather than from the club.Morrin, p. 205. The club has also received criticism from some quarters for its poor treatment of the survivors: Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower were forced to leave the flats they rented from the club to make way for new players. Berry was also notified by post that his employment with the club had been terminated. Another survivor, goalkeeper Ray Wood, complained about the lack of recognition from the club: \"We feel that we helped to build Manchester United... They received massive international support following the disaster but they didn't treat people properly then, did nothing for us all those years, and they're still making money out of it directly now.\""]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 in English football", "response": ["*7 July 2002: Ray Wood, 71, Manchester United and England goalkeeper, who was a survivor of the Munich Air Disaster and won two league championship medals."]}, {"page": "Cyprus national football team", "response": ["*  Ray Wood (1970\u20131971)"]}, {"page": "APOEL FC", "response": ["* 1971\u20131972  Ray Wood"]}, {"page": "Kenya national football team", "response": ["* Ray Wood (1975)"]}, {"page": "Gerry Byrne (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["The aftermath of another high-profile match led to calls, again, for the Football Association to allow a substitute to be selected by each team in competitive matches. In FA Cup finals over the previous decade there had been a notable number of teams reduced to ten men or hampered considerably by hard challenges from opposition players. This included goalkeepers Bert Trautmann (in 1955) and Ray Wood (in 1957) suffering a broken neck and broken cheekbone respectively; while two wingers in successive years were stretchered off with broken legs (Roy Dwight in 1959 and Dave Whelan in 1960) and a full back left hobbling for three-quarters of the game with a damaged ankle (Len Chalmers in 1961).

As a result, Wolves became founding members of the new league. During the inaugural 1968 season Wolves played in the Pacific Division alongside the San Diego Toros, Oakland Clippers and Vancouver Royals. With a team coached by Ray Wood and featuring  Carlos Metidieri, but no Wolverhampton Wanderers players, they failed to repeat the success of the previous season. After finishing third in their division, Wolves were one of several NASL franchises that folded after just one season.

Nicknamed \"Twiggy\" by his teammates, he was renowned for his versatility. He began his career as a left-half before the emergence of Duncan Edwards in this position, when he switched to the forward positions, but the Manchester United manager Matt Busby recognised his intelligent positioning sense and aerial power and chose to play him at centre-half by the 1955\u201356 season, with John Doherty and Billy Whelan now competing for his former position, although he faced fierce competition for the solitary centre-half place due to the presence of Mark Jones. He covered in goal in the 1957 FA Cup Final while Ray Wood received treatment for an injury suffered in a collision with Peter McParland, who scored both of Aston Villa's goals as United lost 2\u20131.

Tommy Taylor had been one of the most expensive players in English footballer when United paid \u00a329,999 for him as a 21-year-old from Barnsley in 1953, whereas Johnny Berry had already been at the club for two years when Taylor arrived.", "Harry Gregg had left the club in the 1966\u201367 season, signing for Stoke City, who had signed Dennis Viollet from United five seasons earlier. Kenny Morgans had moved to Swansea City in 1961, having rarely played for United after the end of the 1957\u201358 season. Albert Scanlon was sold to Newcastle United in November 1960. Ray Wood had been sold to Huddersfield Town within a year of the Munich crash, having been unable to win back his place in the team from Harry Gregg, leaving Old Trafford around the same time as Colin Webster, who was sold to Swansea Town. Wilf McGuinness suffered a broken leg in a reserve match during the 1959\u201360 season and never returned to the first team, although he stayed with the club as a member of the coaching staff and spent 18 months as United's manager after the retirement of Sir Matt Busby in May 1969.

However, the side captained by Johnny Carey was beginning to show its age and a new set of players had to be found. Busby had already made an important signing the previous year by paying Birmingham City \u00a325,000 for winger Johnny Berry, and as long ago as 1949 had signed young goalkeeper Ray Wood from Darlington, while a young Roger Byrne had excelled on the left wing in the title run-in, but many other positions were in need of changes.", "The Championship was defended successfully in 1957, with Tommy Taylor scoring 22 goals, Liam Whelan getting 26 and a young Bobby Charlton grabbing 10 goals.

McParland's two-goal haul is remembered fondly as an example of his all-round abilities as a player showcasing his diving header and volleying techniques."]}]}}
