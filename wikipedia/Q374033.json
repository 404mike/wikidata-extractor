He attended Oxford Polytechnic (now Oxford Brookes University) and then Cranfield University - in place of the strain gauge he had been expected to present as a final-year project he turned up for his viva voce examination in Mechanical Engineering with a brand new self-designed Formula Ford chassis (which he had to disguise as a Formula Three as he was sponsored by a rival car manufacturer) on a trailer. At Cranfield Reynard was a classmate of Pat Symonds. Teaming up with the experienced mechanic Bill Stone, Reynard set up Sabre Automotive which later became Reynard Motorsport. Reynard's cars were originally built so he could go racing himself; he was successful in Formula Ford and Formula Ford 2000 but the company he built rapidly became successful in many other formulae.\nAdrian Reynard had several brushes with Formula One early in his career\u2014he was commissioned to design a Hawke Formula One car for Rupert Keegan in the mid-1970s (this was not seen through\u2014Reynard had never designed a monocoque before), and later became Chief Engineer for RAM-March in 1982 when the team was struggling with overweight copies of the Williams FW07. He claims to have engineered the cars to the state they should have been in at the start of the 1981 season, but little was achieved. While Reynard was undertaking these contracts, other hands continued to run his firm.\nA Reynard F1 project went sour in 1991 and took the company to the brink of bankruptcy\u2014Reynard had to sell many of his personal assets\u2014but the firm fought back, continuing to dominate Formula 3000 until it became a single-chassis formula at the end of the 1995 season and entering Champ Car very successfully in 1994. Overly ambitious attempts to expand the company (and, possibly, Adrian Reynard's increasing involvement with British American Racing) led to financial difficulties.\nOxford Brookes university made up for Reynard's lack of a degree by awarding him an honorary doctorate. Adrian Reynard maintains his links with Cranfield University where he is Visiting Professor and serves on the advisory panel for the MSc Motorsport Engineering and Management. He makes an annual award for the best motorsport thesis project at Cranfield.\nHe received the Queen's Awards for Export Achievement in 1990 and 1996. Currently, Reynard has signed up to join the \"Founders\" of Virgin Galactic, an elite group of civilians who will be among the first people to ride into space for a price.\nReynard has recently partnered with Andre Brown to relaunch Reynard Racing Cars with a new street legal trackday/race car.\nIn February 2009, he was linked with Richard Branson's Virgin Group, regarding a takeover of the Honda Racing F1 Team.\nReynard continues to work as a consultant on particular engineering topics within his vehicle engineering skill set. He is also the Chairman of the Auto Research Centre, which has its world headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States.\nReynard was hired by Ginetta Cars to develop the aerodynamics for their 2018 LMP1 racecar.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 23", "response": ["*  1951   \u2013 Adrian Reynard, English businessman, founded Reynard Motorsport"]}, {"page": "British American Racing", "response": ["In 1997, the corporation was convinced by Craig Pollock to provide most of the equity to purchase the Tyrrell Formula One team for GB\u00a330\u00a0million.

The team acquired a major sponsorship deal from Rothmans in 1982, but the money came too late for Herd or Adrian Reynard (who was working as chief engineer) to improve the performance of the cars. In 1983, McDonald started building his own cars and March was left outside F1 once more.

Adrian Reynard formed a very effective working partnership with friend and Formula Ford rival Rick Gorne, who looked after the sales and commercial side of the business. Gorne was one of the first people to bring a commercial mindset to the sale of racing cars - he worked out pricing models for cars and spares (basing this on research into how often cars were damaged) and started \"networking\" with young drivers early in their careers so that they would be favourably disposed towards Reynard later.", "Reynard's success in F3 was transitory, with Dallara and a revived Ralt obliterating them from the market in 1992; Adrian Reynard sought to buy Ralt but the company ended up in the hands of March.
