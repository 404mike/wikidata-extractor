Within a few weeks of his arrival at Penzance he was elected one of the secretaries and curators of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, and he was for many years its president. His interesting annual addresses and many other papers on zoology by him are published in the Transactions of that society, vols. i. and ii. He contributed the third part (on the zoophytes) to the Cornish Fauna, written by his father; and an account of the natural history of West Cornwall to J.S. Courtney's Guide to Penzance, 1845. Other interesting papers on zoophytes, crustacea, and fishes were contributed by him to the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, the Reports of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, The Zoologist, Annals of Natural History, &c., all of which are recorded in Boase and Courtney's Bibliotheca Cornubiensis, i. 924, iii. 1138. Among these may be mentioned observations on the zoophytes of Cornwall, on the development of the frog, on the metamorphosis of the decapod crustaceans, and the natural history of the mackerel in the Polytechnic Reports for 1842 and 1844; and on the nest of the fifteen-spined stickleback in the Penzance Natural History Transactions, ii. 7983.

Moorland usually refers to uncultivated land on a hill, but locally it is also applied to wetlands such as this, and the nearby Kerris and Clodgy Moors. The high rainfall, poor drainage and acid conditions inhibit the action of bacteria which break down plant material resulting in the accumulation of a dark brown, fibrous material known as peat.
