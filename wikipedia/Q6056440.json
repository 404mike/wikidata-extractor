However it is his work with Denis Villeneuve for which he is best known. His first collaboration with Villeneuve was Prisoners in 2013. He subsequently worked on Villeneuve's films Sicario (2015), which was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Score, and Arrival (2016). J\u00f3hann joined Villeneuve once again to work on Blade Runner 2049, but at some point during production Villeneuve decided that the music needed a change in direction. In describing the artistic process for Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve stated that \"the movie needed something different, and I needed to go back to something closer to Vangelis. J\u00f3hann and I decided that I will need to go in another direction.\"  Villeneuve brought in Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch to complete the project. J\u00f3hann's work on James Marsh's The Theory of Everything won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score in 2015. His final works were for the films Mandy, The Mercy, and Mary Magdalene.  In an interview following the release of Arrival, J\u00f3hann commented on his process stating that \"it's about putting yourself in a receptive state of mind where you react to inputs, and it can be from anywhere.  It doesn't really matter if you're writing for film or if you're doing your own piece; you always have to put yourself into that space.\" He went on to say, \"there are practical parameters, of course, involved in writing film music rather than doing your own album, but I view them very much as the same body of work. And, for me, there are very clear lines for me between Englab\u00f6rn to Arrival.\""]}, {"page": "Blade Runner (soundtrack)", "response": ["In 2017, a sequel to Blade Runner was released, Blade Runner 2049. Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch collaborated on the Blade Runner 2049 score, and the original Blade Runner soundtrack served as inspiration for their work. The composers included a Yamaha CS-80 analog synthesizer among the instruments in an effort to maintain stylistic continuity with Vangelis's original 1982 film score. Zimmer said of the soundtrack: \"Ridley [Scott] is a hard act to follow \u2013 as is Vangelis. While Ben [Wallfisch] was four years old, I had actually experienced all of this. We watched and literally, as we stopped watching, we decided on the palette. We decided this wasn't going to be an orchestral thing. The story spoke to us.\"  The sequel score includes a fairly faithful remake of the original \"Tears in Rain\" (retitled \"Tears in the Rain\") and borrows many musical cues from the original Vangelis score throughout, including its frequent use of pitch bending."]}, {"page": "Dear Wendy", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Benjamin Wallfisch"]}, {"page": "Gavin Greenaway", "response": ["| Benjamin Wallfisch"]}, {"page": "Batman (franchise)", "response": ["| Benjamin Wallfisch "]}, {"page": "Hollywood Studio Symphony", "response": ["| Lights Out || Benjamin Wallfisch || ||", "| Annabelle: Creation || Benjamin Wallfisch || ||"]}, {"page": "List of film director and composer collaborations", "response": ["*Benjamin Wallfisch", "*Benjamin Wallfisch", "*Benjamin Wallfisch"]}, {"page": "WaterTower Music", "response": ["| Benjamin Wallfisch"]}, {"page": "Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Score", "response": ["| Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer || Blade Runner 2049"]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (soundtrack)", "response": ["The score was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra at Air Lyndhurst Studios and Abbey Road Studios in London with orchestrations provided by Williams, Alexander Courage, Conrad Pope, John Neufeld, Eddie Karam, Pete Anthony, Benjamin Wallfisch and Larry Rench.
