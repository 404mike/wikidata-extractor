The Oxford History of the Biblical World states \"There is little if any effect of Zoroastrian elements on Judaism in the Persian period.\"The Oxford History of the Biblical World, M. Coogan, ed., 1998. Nevertheless, scholars such as Soloman Nigosian contend, in regarding the similar ideas of Zoroaster and later Jewish writers, that \"the ideas were indigenous to Iran...it is hardly conceivable that some of the characteristic ideas and practices in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam came into being without Zoroastrian influence.\"S. A. Nigosian, The Zoroastrian Faith, 97 The new faith (Zoroastrianism) emerged in larger Persian empires. \" Zoroastrianism reflected the cosmopolitan society of the empires\". During this time Zoroastrianism profoundly effected the beliefs and values of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (\"Traditions & Encounters: A brief global History\", Jerry H. Bentley. pg. 93).
