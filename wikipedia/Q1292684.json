The sections, near the mouth of the Hutt River, were laid out in parallelograms, with the plan including boulevards and public parks. Settlers who had bought a town section had also bought 100 \"country acres\" (about 40ha), where they could grow their food. Smith considered it important to locate the town and country areas close together and the Hutt Valley appeared to promise that space. The drawback was that his chosen locality was a mix of dense forest, scrub, flax and swamp, its river was prone to flooding and the beach so flat that when the first passenger ships began to arrive\u2014just four days after Smith began his survey work\u2014they were forced to anchor 1600 metres from the shore. But construction of temporary houses began, as well as the assembly of wooden houses that had been carried on each ship, while tents also soon dotted the dunes behind the beach. Local M\u0101ori assisted with the construction and also provided food\u2014fish, potatoes and other vegetables and occasionally pork.Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845, page 196.", "thumb|350px|left|Lambton Harbour at Port Nicholson.Eight weeks later, in March, after all passenger ships had arrived, settlers voted to abandon surveying at Pito-one\u2014where the swamps, repeated flooding and poor anchorage facilities were proving too much of an obstacle\u2014and move the town to Wakefield's preferred location of Thorndon at Lambton Bay (later Lambton Quay), which was named in honour of Lord Durham.Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845, pages 199, 215. Surveyors quickly encountered problems, however, when they discovered the land selected for the new settlement was still inhabited by M\u0101ori, who expressed astonishment and bewilderment to find P\u0101keh\u0101 tramping through their homes, gardens and cemeteries and driving wooden survey pegs into the ground. Surveyors became involved in skirmishes with the M\u0101ori, most of whom refused to budge, and were provided with weapons to continue their work.", "In line with his instructions, Wakefield promised local M\u0101ori they would be given reserves of land equal to one-tenth of the area, with their allotments chosen by lottery and sprinkled among the European settlers. The reserves were to remain inalienable to ensure that the M\u0101ori would not quickly sell the land to speculators. Jerningham Wakefield, the nephew of William Wakefield who had also arrived on the Tory in 1839, espoused the company's hope that interspersing M\u0101ori with white settlers would help them change their \"rude and uncivilised habits\". In a later book on his New Zealand adventures he wrote: \"The constant example before their eyes, and constant emulation to attain the same results, would naturally lead the inferior race, by an easy ascent, to a capacity for acquiring the knowledge, habits, desires and comforts of their civilised neighbours.\"Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845, pages 41, 42", "In November 1840, the New Zealand Company directors advised Wakefield that they wished to name the town at Lambton Harbour after the Duke of Wellington in recognition of his strong support for the company's principles of colonisation and his \"strenuous and successful defence against its enemies of the measure for colonising South Australia\".  Settlers enthusiastically accepted the proposal.Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845.", "Gipps introduced his New Zealand Land Claims Bill to the New South Wales Legislative Council in May 1840, instituting a process to appoint commissioners who would investigate all lands acquired from M\u0101ori and the conditions under which the transactions had taken place. The Bill also stipulated that M\u0101ori owned only the land which they \"occupied\", by living on or cultivating it; all other land was deemed \"waste\" land and owned by the Crown.Peter Adams, Fatal Necessity, Auckland University Press, 1977, chapter 7. The subsequent Act, passed on 4 August,Rose Daamen, \"The Crown's Right of Pre-Emption and Fitzroy's Waiver Purchases\", Waitangi Tribunal, August 1998, page 36. prohibited the grant of any land purchase greater than four square miles (2560 acres). The New Zealand Company had already claimed to have bought two million acres (8,000\u00a0km2), part of which it had sold directly to settlers, and when news of the government move reached Wellington in August it sparked panic, prompting hundreds of settlers to prepare to abandon their land and sail to Valpara\u00edso, Chile.An Account of the Settlements of the New Zealand Company by The Hon H W Petre (Smith, Elder and Co, 1842), Chapter 3.Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845, pages 350\u2013358. In a bid to restore certainty to the settlers over their land claims a three-man deputation was sent to Sydney to meet Gipps; in early December the deputation returned with news that Gipps would procure for the Wellington settlers a confirmation of their titles to 110,000 acres of land, as well as their town, subject to several conditions including that the 110,000 acres were taken in one continuous block, native reserves were guaranteed and that reserves were made for public purposes.Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub.

Four days later Eliza died, and Edward resigned his post. The two children were brought up by their aunt, Wakefield's older sister, Catherine.", "The 1837 Rebellion in Lower Canada had been suppressed, but the colony was in turmoil. The Government of Lord Melbourne wanted to send John George Lambton, Lord Durham to settle the disputes. He and Wakefield had been working together closely on the New Zealand scheme, and he was a convert to Wakefield's colonial theories; the report embodied Wakefield's ideas, and he surreptitiously leaked it to The Times, to prevent the government from tampering with it. Durham was only prepared to accept the task if Wakefield accompanied him as Commissioner of Crown Lands. However, they both knew that Wakefield would be completely unacceptable to the British government, so Durham planned to announce the appointment only after he had reached Canada. Wakefield and his son, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, sailed secretly for Canada in 1838, but before they arrived word had leaked out, and the appointment was forbidden by London. Despite this, Durham retained him as an unofficial representative, advisor and negotiator, giving him effectively the same powers he would have had if he been appointed.", "Meanwhile, Wakefield was getting involved in a new scheme. He was working with John Robert Godley to promote a new settlement in New Zealand, this one to be sponsored by the Church of England. This plan matured to become the Canterbury Settlement. The first ship sailed from England in December 1849 with Godley in command of the expedition. Jerningham Wakefield also sailed with them, his health and finances ruined by his dissipated lifestyle in London. The first immigrant ships bound for Canterbury sailed from Plymouth in September 1850, and others followed.", "*Adventure in New Zealand by Edward Jerningham Wakefield, John Murray, 1845"]}, {"page": "William Wakefield", "response": ["Other problems arose. Many of the settlers were not happy with the land they had been allocated, others were not getting the land they had paid for. To satisfy its commitments the New Zealand Company needed about 500\u00a0km\u00b2, which was difficult given the lack of arable land in the Wellington area. Furthermore, Wakefield's nephew, Jerningham Wakefield, was causing concern, drinking heavily and fornicating with M\u0101ori women. Altogether Wakefield was beset on all sides, and seemed to withdraw into himself; one of the settlers described him as \"the coldest mannered man they have met\". Despite all the difficulties, the colony thrived, Port Nicholson or Brittania became Wellington and continued to grow. The death of his brother Arthur in the Wairau Affray (as it is now called, rather than Massacre) was a huge blow particularly as Wakefield felt partly responsible. Governor Hobson died in September 1842 and was replaced by Robert FitzRoy. Initially Fitzroy and Wakefield clashed seriously, particularly when FitzRoy declined to take any action against his brother's killers, as the settler party was acting illegally over a questionable land claim."]}, {"page": "Felix Wakefield", "response": ["He arrived in Nelson, New Zealand in 1854, bringing with him two red deer.

Then, from 31 August 1854 to 2 September 1854, there was another four-person cabinet led by Thomas Forsaith, with James Macandrew, William Travers, and Jerningham Wakefield. Some historians consider FitzGerald and Forsaith to be New Zealand's first Prime Ministers, but neither held any formal leadership role and since \"responsible government\" had not yet been obtained, they had little real power.

The journal's editor, historian W. David McIntyre, calls it \"the most absorbing and undoubtedly the fullest private manuscript relating to New Zealand in the 1850s\". In late July 1853, Sewell decided that he would stand for Parliament in the 1853 general election; the question was whether he should run in the Town of Christchurch or the Christchurch Country electorate. There was one position to be filled in the town electorate, and two in the rural electorate. Sewell sought counsel from some friends, who recommended for him to stand in the rural electorate, but he did not want to oppose Guise Brittan, who had already declared his candidacy. Whilst Brittan was unpopular with the constituency, Sewell thought that it would be useful to have him in Parliament. The complication with the town electorate was that John Watts-Russell had already received a pledge from the majority of that constituency, but there were rumours that he would not stand, and it was known that he was just about to go travelling during the time of the election campaign. Sewell talked to Brittan, who fully supported him standing in the town electorate, and Brittan pledged that he would get his brother-in-law, Charles Fooks, to canvas for him.
