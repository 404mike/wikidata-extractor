Rippingille's Sketching Party in Leigh Woods (c.\u00a01828) depicts a sketching excursion in Leigh Woods typical of those made by the school's members. He worked particularly closely with Edward Bird, and was influenced by Bird's genre painting, which was naturalistic and freshly coloured. In 1814 they both exhibited works at the Royal Academy with the same subject, The Cheat Detected. Rippingille was also a close friend of Francis Danby, and his style developed alongside that of Danby under Bird's influence. In 1819 Rippingille had a success at the Royal Academy with The Post Office. In 1822 the Royal Academy saw The Recruiting Sergeant, a work following the style of Bird, and The Funeral Procession of William Canynge to St Mary Redcliffe, 1474. These works were among Rippingille's finest achievements in the fields of genre and historical painting respectively."]}, {"page": "Nathan Cooper Branwhite", "response": ["Branwhite was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, the son of a poet, Peregrine Branwhite, and became a pupil of Isaac Taylor.

He participated in the sketching activities of the Bristol School and was a friend of Edward Bird and James Johnson.

He did not have the resources to be Bird's patron, but he would lend Bird items from his art collection to study. In 1814 when Bird asked for help in gaining a royal commission, Cumberland introduced him to Charles Long, who then arranged with the Prince\u00a0Regent for Bird to conduct royal portrait studies aboard the royal yacht. On Bird's death in 1819 Cumberland successfully petitioned the Royal Academy to provide a pension for Bird's widow."]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| Edward Bird   ||align=\"center\" |  1815  || "]}]}}
