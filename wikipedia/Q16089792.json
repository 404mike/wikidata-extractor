He was born in Broadwater, Sussex, England. The cricket writer, Colin Bateman, commented that \"Sri Lanka's historic first victory over England early in 1993 will have given at least one English Test player a certain amount of satisfaction.  Don Smith, a steady left-handed opener capable of some useful seam bowling, became Sri Lanka's national coach in the late 1980s\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1923", "response": ["** Donald Smith, English cricketer (d. 2021)"]}, {"page": "Ian Thomson (cricketer)", "response": ["In January 2021, following the death of Donald Smith, Thomson became England's oldest living Test cricketer.

James Langridge reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to appendicitis. Charles Oakes and new captain Hugh Bartlett were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary Billy Griffith had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour.
