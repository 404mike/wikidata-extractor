He played in The Football League for Chester City.\nKaye began his career as an apprentice with Rotherham United, where he turned professional in November 1977. However, he failed to make a league appearance for the Millers and played non-league football for Mexborough Town before returning to The Football League when he joined Chester City in March 1985. He played in Chester's final seven games of the 1984\u20131985 season and then played three league games and a League Cup tie early the following season. Kaye lost his place to John Butcher and Chester then signed another goalkeeper in Ray Cashley.\nKaye moved on to Denaby United, before joining Scarborough. He played 17 times as they won the GM Vauxhall Conference title in 1986\u20131987 but did not play for the club again after promotion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denaby United F.C.", "response": ["*  David Kaye"]}, {"page": "John Butcher (English footballer)", "response": ["After not playing for Oxford during the 1983\u201384 season, Butcher was allowed to join Chester City on a free transfer in August 1984. He made his debut on the opening day of the new season against Scunthorpe United and went on to play 36 first-team games during the season. The following campaign saw Butcher have spells out of the side after losing out to David Kaye and Ray Cashley and he was allowed to return to Bury for another loan spell in October 1985. A month later he was back at Chester and missed just three of the final 29 games as the Blues were promoted from Division Four. The summer of 1986 saw Billy Stewart signed by Harry McNally and he was to largely be first choice ahead of Butcher in 1986\u201387, whose final appearance for the club was a 1\u20130 defeat to Blackpool on 4 May 1987."]}, {"page": "David Kaye", "response": ["David Kaye may refer to:", "* David Kaye (voice actor) (born 1964), Canadian-American voice actor", "* David Kaye (footballer) (born 1959), English footballer", "* David Kaye (magician), known professionally as \"Silly Billy\"", "* David Kaye (academic), UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion"]}, {"page": "Paul Evans (football manager)", "response": ["In 1986, Neil Warnock went to Scarborough as Manager and he took Evans, his former goalkeeper at Burton Albion, with him as his Assistant Manager. Warnock and Evans arrived at Scarborough and quickly signed Cec Podd, Barry Gallagher and Paul Kendell from Halifax Town, Mike Brolly and Tommy Graham from Scunthorpe United, David Kaye from Chester City and Andy Harrison and Steve Richards from Kettering Town. Warnock also added Stuart Mell who was with Warnock and Evans at Burton Albion. The season started pretty average so Warnock signed Ian Bennyworth and Mitch Cook. With the season still going pretty average; Warnock signed Kevin Blackwell on a months loan from Barnet in November 1986 and this started an upturn in fortunes. After the months loan ended Warnock paid Barry Fry's Barnet \u00a32,000 for Blackwell's services. On 13 December Scarborough went top of the league following Barnet's loss to Maidstone United. However, a week after this the club was knocked sideways as the chairman; Barry Adamson died of a heart attack at an FA Trophy game against Morecambe. At one point in April, Scarborough were seven points clear at the top of the GM Vauxhall Conference, and due to Barnet losing at Stafford Rangers Scarborough won the title and were subsequently promoted to the Fourth Division. Basically, Warnock and Evans had brought instant success with Scarborough winning the Football Conference in 1987. Warnock and Evans remained at Scarborough until they moved on to Notts County in 1989 after Warnock had fallen out with chairman Geoffrey Richmond."]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | David Kaye"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | David Kaye"]}]}}
