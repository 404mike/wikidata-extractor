As Cotilium lies to the northeast of Phigalia, and Pausanias in this description seems to have looked towards the east, Mt. Elaeum should probably be placed on the opposite side of Phigalia, and consequently to the south of the Neda, in which case it would correspond to the lofty mountain of K\u00favela. Mt. Elaeum contained a cavern sacred to the Black Demeter, situated in a grove of oaks. Of the position of Mt. Cotilium there is no doubt. On it was situated the temple of Apollo Epicurius, which was built in the Peloponnesian War by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon at Athens. It was erected by the Phigaleans in consequence of the relief afforded by Apollo during the plague in the Peloponnesian War, whence he received the surname of Epicurius. The temple stood in a place called Bassae, and according to Pausanias excelled all the temples of Peloponnesus, except that of Athena Alea at Tegea, in the beauty of the stone and the accuracy of its masonry. He particularly mentions that the roof was of stone as well as the rest of the building.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.41.7-8. This temple still remains almost entire, and is next to the Theseum at Athens the best preserved of the temples of Greece. It stands in a glen (whence the name \u0392\u1fb6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, Doric for \u0392\u03ae\u03c3\u03c3\u03b7, \u0392\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9) near the summit of Mt. Cotilium, in the midst of a wilderness of rocks, studded with old knotty oaks. Nineteenth-century British scholar William Mure who visited the site wrote that \u201cthere is certainly no remnant of the architectural splendour of Greece more calculated to fascinate the imagination than this temple; whether by its own size and beauty, by the contrast it offers to the wild desolation of the surrounding scenery, or the extent and variety of the prospect from its site.\u201dWilliam Mure, Journal of a Tour in Greece and the Ionian Islands (1842, Edinburgh), vol. ii. p. 270. A spring rises about ten minutes walk southwest of the temple, and soon afterwards loses itself in the ground, as Pausanias has described. North of the temple was the highest summit of the mountain, which one reaches in ten minutes' time by a broad road constructed by the Greeks. This summit was called Cotilum (\u039a\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd), whence the whole mountain derived the name of Cotilian; here was a sanctuary of Aphrodite, of which there are still some traces. The grandeur of the ruins of the temple have given to the whole of the surrounding district the name of the Columns (\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 or \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2). The temple is at least two and a half hours walk from the ruins of the city, and consequently more than the 40 stadia, which Pausanias mentions as the distance from Phigalia to Cotilium; but this distance perhaps applies to the nearest part of the mountain from the city."]}, {"page": "Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Mure", "| William Mure", "| William Mure"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Renfrewshire||William Mure||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Sir James Hunter Blair, 1st Baronet", "response": ["* Anne Hunter Blair (d. 1854), who married William Mure of Caldwell (d. 1831), son of William Mure (1718\u20131776), and father of William Mure (1799\u20131860)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale", "response": ["Thomas Lister was born on 29 October 1854 in Fontainebleau, France, the eldest son of Thomas Lister, 3rd Baron Ribblesdale (1828\u20131876), and his wife Emma (n\u00e9e Mure) (1833\u20131911), daughter of William Mure.L.

Its situation, on the summit of a knoll, itself of rather conical form, while it increases the apparent size of the tumulus, adds much to its general loftiness and grandeur of effect. The roof of the vault, with the greater part of its material, is now gone, its shape being represented by a round cavity or crater on the summit of the tumulus. The doorway is still entire. It is 6 feet wide at its upper and narrower part. The stone lintel is 15 feet in length.
