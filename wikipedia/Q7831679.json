She works with several other British songwriters including Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson of Absolute and Mark Taylor.\nIn the 1980s she was used as a vocalist by record producer Nigel Wright on many of his megamix-styled medley projects. Originally projects like Enigma and This Year's Blonde were set up as rivals to the success of Jaap Eggermont's Starsound/Stars on 45, though in the late 1980s Wright increasingly targeted the house scene with 'Jack Mix' act Mirage (with Mirage including a co-credit for Ackerman on their pre-house 1985 medley \"Into the Groove\"). Other 1980s work included touring with Dead or Alive, singing lead on \"Ice\" from Rick Wakeman's 1988 solo album Time Machine, backing vocals on some of Shakatak's albums and performing backing vocals during Eric Clapton's 1988 immensely successful anniversary tour. On Clapton's tour she performed alongside Tessa Niles, a vocalist who she has sung backing vocals with on various albums by Gary Numan.\nShe has recorded several of her own tracks and had a couple of hit singles in the 1990s when she was the featured credited vocalist on a number of dance cover versions. Her biggest hit as a featured vocalist was on a version of Minnie Riperton's \"Loving You\", which got to No. 25 in 1990 (credited to Massivo ft Tracy and released on Debut Records), whilst a cover of the Brenda Russell's hit, \"Get Here\". was a No. 37 hit in 1993 (with an act called Q taking the main credit). She also toured with Boyzone in the 1990s and was a vocalist for Almighty Records' Hi-NRG ABBA covers project Abbacadabra, alongside other singers such as Karen Boddington, Belle Lawrence and Martin Jenkins.Ackerman attended Gordano School and lives in Berkshire.
