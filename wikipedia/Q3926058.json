The name \"Picard\" suggests a French origin, but his music is regarded as being in an English tradition. He is one of the most prolific composers represented in the Old Hall Manuscript (British Library: Additional 57950), with nine works from it attributed to him. His music is in the ars nova style, and is unusual in its virtuosity.\nA mass by Pycard in the Old Hall manuscript illustrates the sophistication of his isorhythmic techniques.  Each quarter note in the lower part equals 4\u00bd quarter notes in the upper parts, creating an uneven ratio of 4:9 that causes the parts to lose synchronization. The lower part then steadily contracts in a series of Pythagorean proportions (12:9:8:6) until the parts come back into alignment (Taruskin 2010, 409\u201310).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of one-word stage names", "response": ["* Pycard, European composer"]}, {"page": "Isorhythm", "response": ["A 15th-century mass by a composer known only as Pycard found in the Old Hall manuscript (named for the English town in which it was eventually discovered), demonstrates the high sophistication and complexity of panisorhythmic techniques.
