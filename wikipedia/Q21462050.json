His mother was Ada Jessie Wilson (1864\u20131896), a daughter and granddaughter respectively of the painters John James Wilson and John \"Jock\" Wilson. His father was Captain Schomberg Kerr (1861\u20131930), formally of the Rifle Brigade, who was descended from General William John Kerr, 5th Marquess of Lothian.

His maternal aunt (a daughter of the painter John James Wilson), Mary Baker (Wilson) Dawbarn (1847\u20131934), who had been widowed in 1917, was the proprietor of her husband's coal factor business.  Kerr joined the company and borrowed about \u00a320,000 from her to buy a 300\u00a0ft yacht to begin a luxury world cruise business.  In return she was to receive \u00a3100 per month for the rest of her life.  Details about the first world cruise were published in the UK and America naming Prince and Princess Andrew of Russia, Lord and Lady Teynham and Admiral Mark Kerr as being associated with the venture.  The project came to nothing and the cost of renovating the yacht had proved too much for Kerr.  Two new partners, who had previously expressed an interest in the yacht, came in to the business.  One of these was Major Robin Thynne (1879\u20131936), an ex-army man."]}, {"page": "John James Wilson (painter)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John James Wilson"]}]}}
