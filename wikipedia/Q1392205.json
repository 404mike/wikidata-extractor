United were in desperate need of a manager to take over from club secretary Walter Crickmer after the war and a board meeting was called in December 1944 so as to ascertain who that new manager might be. Knowing that Liverpool had already offered Busby a job, Rocca convinced the United board to \"leave it to [him]\" and immediately wrote a letter to Busby, addressed to his army regiment. The letter was vague, referring only to \"a job\", just in case it fell into the wrong hands, namely the Liverpool officials."]}, {"page": "Bill Foulkes", "response": ["Duncan Edwards died 15 days later as a result of his injuries.

He scored on his debut in a win over Barnsley at Oakwell on 2 February, and totalled eight goals in 1937\u201338, as United finished in second place and were thus promoted back into the top-flight. The Red Devils then consolidated their First Division status with a 14th-place finish in 1938\u201339, Smith scoring six goals. The outbreak of World War II then meant that the Football League was suspended for seven whole seasons. Smith was prolific in the War League Western Division in 1939\u201340, scoring 16 goals in United's 22 matches. He stayed at Old Trafford in 1940\u201341, bagging 26 goals in the War League North Regional League, including five against Blackburn Rovers on 28 December. In 1941\u201342 he hit 18 goals, as United finished fourth in the first edition of the War League North Regional League, before winning the second instalment of the competition."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.

The finances were once again in a mess, and the much criticised Herbert Bamlett resigned. Secretary Walter Crickmer was given control of the team for the next season, and was aided by chief scout Louis Rocca, largely because the club couldn't afford a new manager. The players had gone to collect their wages just before Christmas and were told there was no money available. Another financial bailout was needed. They managed to finish mid table in the Second Division in 1931\u201332, despite losing 7\u20130 at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Boxing Day 1931, but with the club's finances precarious it seemed possible that the club could go out of business."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.

In 1958, Crickmer was killed in the Munich air disaster along with eight Manchester United players, two other members of the club's staff and various others as the team returned from a European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade. Along with his wife Betty, Olive was responsible for breaking the news to the victims' families and helping to organise funerals. He was officially made club secretary in the summer of 1958 and remained in the role until his retirement in 1988, when he joined the club's board of directors."]}]}}
