He was prebendary of Exeter, and vicar of Hendon.\nGraduating from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 after studying at Southwark, he became a teacher of classics at a number of schools in southern England, and from 1846 to 1856 was headmaster of a school in Falmouth, Cornwall. He was also for 15 years rector of Gerrans, Cornwall.\nInitially making a name for himself editing the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, Scrivener edited several editions of the New Testament and collated the Codex Sinaiticus with the Textus Receptus. For his services to textual criticism and the understanding of biblical manuscripts, he was granted a Civil list pension in 1872. He was an advocate of the Byzantine text (majority text) over more modern manuscripts as a source for Bible translations. He was the first to distinguish the Textus Receptus from the Byzantine text. Scrivener compared the Textus Receptus with the editions of Stephanus (1550), Theodore Beza (1565), and Elzevier (1633) and enumerated all the differences. In addition he identified the differences between the Textus Receptus and editions by Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf. Scrivener doubted the authenticity of texts like Matthew 16:2b\u20133, Christ's agony at Gethsemane, John 5:3.4, and the Pericope Adulterae.\nIn 1874, he became prebendary of Exeter and vicar of Hendon, where he remained for the rest of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lectio difficilior potior", "response": ["It was also laid down by Johann Albrecht Bengel, in his Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci Rect\u00e8 Caut\u00e8que Adornandi, 1725, and employed in his Novum Testamentum Graecum, 1734.Noted in an observation by Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener in A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New testament (E.

For example, verse 9 says Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene on \"the first day of the week\", yet verse 2 said that same day Mary Magdalene did not see Jesus. Perhaps more significantly, verse 9 finds it necessary to identify Mary Magdalene as the woman who had been freed of seven demons, as if she had not been named before, yet she was mentioned without that detail being mentioned in 15:47 and 16:1.J.C. du Buisson, The Origin and Peculiar Characteristics of the Gospel of S. Mark and its Relation to the Synoptists, being the Ellerton Essay, 1896 (1896, Oxford, Clarendon Press) page 39; Henry Barclay Swete, The Gospel according to St. Mark (1913, London, Macmillan & Co.) pages cx and 399 (\"She is introduced to the reader as if she not been mentioned before\"); also Travis B. Williams, Bringing Method to the Madness: Examining the Style of the Longer Ending of Mark, Bulletin for Biblical Research, vol. 20, nr. 3 (2010) page 410 (\"the description of Mary Magdalene is an important indicator of inauthenticity in this verse\"). Verse 9 in Greek does not mention Jesus by name or title, but only says \"Having arisen ... he appeared ...\" (the KJV's inclusion of the name Jesus was an editorial emendation as indicated by the use of italic typeface) \u2013 and, in fact, Jesus is not expressly named until verses 19 and 20 (\"the Lord\" in both verses); a lengthy use of a pronoun without identification. Additionally, the style and vocabulary of the longer ending appear not to be in the same style as the rest of the Gospel. The Greek text used by the KJV translators is 166 words long, using a vocabulary of (very approximately) 140 words.Using the text in Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, The New Testament in the Original Greek according to the text followed in The Authorised Version (1881, Cambridge, Univ. Press) loc.cit.; the 166th word, \"Amen\", according to the Appendix of this edition (page 649), did not appear in all Textus Receptus editions \u2013 it appeared in the Complutensian, Colineaeus, the first three editions of Stephanus, and the first edition of Beza, while the \"Amen\" was lacking in the editions of Erasmus, the fourth edition of Stephanus, Beza's editions after his first, the Clementine edition of the Latin Vulgate, and Tyndal's English. Yet, out of that small number, 16 words do not appear elsewhere in the Gospel of Mark, 5 words are used here in a different way than used elsewhere in Mark, and 4 phrases do not appear elsewhere in Mark.Paul L. Danove, The End of Mark's Story: A methodological study (1993, Leiden, E.J. Brill) pages 122\u2013124; also Travis B. Williams, Bringing Method to the Madness: Examining the Style of the Longer Ending of Mark, Bulletin for Biblical Research, vol. 20, nr. 3 (2010) pages 405\u2013409 (additionally there are peculiarities in Greek grammar and usage, which are difficult to explain in English); also Ezra P. Gould, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to St. Mark: The International Critical Commentary (1896, NY, Scribners) page 302. The shorter ending, in Greek, is approximately (depending on the variants) 32 words long,Using the UBS edition. of which 7 words do not appear elsewhere in Mark. The Freer Logion consists of 89 words,Using the UBS edition in the footnote to verse 14. of which 8 words do not appear elsewhere in Mark.Paul L. Danove, The End of Mark's Story: A methodological study (1993, Leiden, E.J. Brill) page 124. The stylistic differences suggest that none of these was written by the author of the Gospel of St. Mark. Metzger speaks of the \"inconcinnities\" [sic] between the first 8 verses of chapter 16 and the longer ending, and suggests, \"all these features indicate that the section was added by someone who knew a form of Mark that ended abruptly with verse 8 and who wished to supply a more appropriate conclusion.\"Bruce M. Metzger, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit, page 125. Alfred Plummer puts it very strongly, \"The twelve verses not only do not belong to Mark, they quite clearly belong to some other document. While Mark has no proper ending, these verses have no proper beginning. ... Not only does verse 9 not fit onto verse 8, but the texture of what follows is quite different from the texture of what precedes. A piece torn from a bit of satin is appended to the torn end of roll of homespun.\"Alfred Plummer, The Gospel according to St. Mark (of the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges series, edited by R. St. John Parry)(1915, Cambridge, Univ. Press) page xliii."]}]}}
