This arose following a visit from the outgoing commander of the garrison, Major General Arthur Edward Grasett. Although a British Army officer, he was a Canadian and a Royal Military College classmate of Crerar's. The British believed that the chance of Japan going to war was remote, and that a show of resolve would reassure China and help deter Japanese aggression. The Canadians were totally dependent on the British assessment of the situation, as there was no Canadian intelligence organisation that could provide an independent evaluation. Crerar had studied the defence of Hong Kong while at the Imperial Defence College in 1934, but he believed that a war with the British Empire and the United States would be disastrous for Japan. Rather than take troops from the UK or the 4th Canadian Division, which was forming in Canada, Crerar chose to send the Winnipeg Grenadiers and the Royal Rifles of Canada, which had been on garrison duty in Jamaica and Newfoundland. In December, the Japanese did attack, and the two battalions were engulfed in the Battle of Hong Kong.  About 300 Canadians were killed in the fighting, and the rest became prisoners of the Japanese. A Royal Commission was convened to inquire into the disaster, but by this time Crerar had moved on, and he escaped censure. Others at NDHQ were less fortunate and were sacked.
