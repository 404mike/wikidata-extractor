His motivation for immigrating was the same as the many who followed him, the promise of free land. He was a native of Lincolnshire experienced in farming and was welcomed by the colonists, desperate for men with agricultural knowledge. He married in 1810 and subsequently raised a family of 6 children.Milson did well in the Colony of New South Wales, and established a number of prosperous businesses, which included supplying ships with stone ballast, fresh water, and the produce of his dairy, orchard, and vegetable gardens.\nIn his own words, in the years before 1825 Milson had \"principally resided in District of Parramatta\" (more specifically in the area in the District of Parramatta then called the \"Field of Mars\").\nIn the early 1820s Milson settled in the District of Sydney in the vicinity of today's Jeffrey Street, Kirribilli, a Sydney suburb on the North Shore of Sydney Harbour. He was a prominent resident of the area for more than 50 years until his death in 1872 at home at \"Gratham\" in the modern suburb of Milsons Point in what was then called the Municipality of East St Leonards.Milson and his sons and grandsons built several homes in the area: \"Brisbane House\" (James Milson), \"Grantham\" (James Milson), \"Fern Lodge\" (James Milson), \"Wia Wia\" (John Milson), \"Elamang\" (James Milson Jnr), \"Coreena\" (Alfred Milson, son of James Milson Jnr), and \"Wayala\" (Arthur Milson, son of James Milson Jnr).

In the early 1820s Milson settled in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street, Kirribilli, on 120 acres of land he leased from Robert Campbell (1769\u20131846).

The sale of this land for residential blocks in the last years of the 19th and early years of the 20th centuries proved to be especially profitable. Much to Milson's disgust, the courts prevented him from selling building blocks running right to the water's edge and Cremorne is consequently one of the few Sydney Harbour peninsulas with a public, waterfront park running around its edges. The last of the family's holdings in the lower North Shore area were resumed in the early 1920s for the construction of the Harbour Bridge and associated roadways.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 174", "In 1853 North Shore pioneer James Milson bought the land - Robertson's house became the Cremorne Hotel, later Cremorne House - and three years later leased  to J.
