His methods were characteristically violent \u2013 he hanged over 800 of the rebels \u2013 but he resigned after two years, having failed in his mission.  Back in west Wales he contented himself with self-enrichment and self-glorification, rebuilding in grand style his two main homes, Carew Castle and Laugharne Castle.  He returned to Ireland as 1584 as Lord Deputy, with the task of crushing the Irish and colonising their land.
