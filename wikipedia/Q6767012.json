Mark Carrington gave Wrexham the lead against the Premier League side, but they went on to lose 3\u20131. Wilkin used the loan system, bringing in the likes of Scott Tancock (Swansea City), Joe Thompson (Bury), Jon Flatt (Wolves), Dan Holman (Colchester United), Sam Finley (TNS), Johnny Hunt (Cambridge United), James Pearson (Leicester City) and Kieron Morris (Walsall). Wilkin's successes in the cups continued in the FA Trophy, as he reached the Semi-Final against Torquay United. Wrexham beat them in both the home and away tie to progress to Wembley Stadium."]}]}}
