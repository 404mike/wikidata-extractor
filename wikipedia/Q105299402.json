The battle, which continued for 75 rounds, was interrupted by the approach of darkness, and the match was drawn. Bandoff next fought George Sims, and was beaten by him on 8 November 1854 and on 17 May 1858. Four years later, however, Bandoff retrieved his reputation as a fighter when he met and defeated Hopkinson after a battle of 28 rounds (9 April 1862). This victory was followed by another on 8 September 1863, when Bandoff defeated Australian boxer Frederick \"Black Billy\" Jackson at Home Circuit after 40 rounds. On the same spot he fought 86 rounds with Callaghan; but owing to darkness the match terminated in a draw. Bandoff's last appearance in the prize-ring was at Thames Haven on 14 February 1865, when he was beaten by Jack Smith, the \"Brighton Doctor,\" after a contest of 16 rounds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Bendoff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Bandoff"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Bendorff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Bandoff"]}, {"page": "Ben Bendoff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Bandoff"]}, {"page": "Ben Bandoff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Bandoff"]}, {"page": "Ben Bendorff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Bandoff"]}]}}
