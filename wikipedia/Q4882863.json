The role of Andrew Hunter was played by William Franklyn, who was succeeded in June 1968 by Richard Coleman. The role of Marion was played by Belinda Carroll. In 1969 the play transferred to the Comedy Theatre, starring Peter Byrne, Karen Kessey and Richard Coleman. Karen Kessey played Marion for two years, never missing a performance.  Later the production starred Charles Tingwell, Gay Singleton and Richard Coleman. Richard Coleman understudied the role of Robert Danvers and played the part occasionally, when required to do so.  The play was taken out on a tour of the UK in 1973, with Danvers reprised by Gerald Flood, who ultimately played the role for over 650 performances. During the tour Andrew was played by Laurence Payne and John Hart Dyke and Marion was portrayed by Katy Manning and Anne Aston."]}]}}
