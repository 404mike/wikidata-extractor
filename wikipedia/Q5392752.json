Baird was born in County Donegal\nin the Irish Free State but moved with his family to Belfast at an early age.A pharmacist and political unionist, Baird became the deputy leader of the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party.  He was elected at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and won a seat in the same constituency on the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention.\nWhen William Craig, the leader of Vanguard, proposed forming a coalition government with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, Baird led the majority of Vanguard in leaving to form the United Ulster Unionist Movement.\nBaird became the leader of the new grouping, which initially pursued a policy of uniting all unionist groups to form a new party.  When this proved impossible, it instead constituted itself as the United Ulster Unionist Party (UUUP), again with Baird as the leader.  He then became a key member of the United Unionist Action Council\nBaird stood for the UUUP in Fermanagh and South Tyrone at the 1979 general election, but won only 17% of the vote, taking fourth position in the poll.  At the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election, he fared even less well, taking only 2,022 first preference votes.\nSometime after this poor performance, the UUUP was dissolved.  Baird then confined his politics to the Orange Order, while building up his \"Baird's Chemists\" chain that became one of Northern Ireland's leading chemists chain, before being bought over in 2011.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Paisley", "response": ["In 1977 the United Unionist Action Council (UUAC) was formed out of the UUUC.

Vanguard had traditionally opposed the concept of compulsory power sharing with nationalists enshrined in the Sunningdale Agreement, but after the failure of Sunningdale, the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention was set up to provide a forum with the aim of finding a new settlement for Northern Ireland. During the proceedings the leader of Vanguard, William Craig, proposed a voluntary coalition with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. Many in Vanguard found this anathema, including the party's deputy leader Ernest Baird, Mid Ulster MP John Dunlop and East Belfast Convention member (and future Ulster Unionist Party leader) Reg Empey. They left Vanguard and formed the United Ulster Unionist Movement. Initially Baird denied that this was a party since the original aim was to create a single Unionist party. When this aim proved unattainable the UUUM relaunched as the United Ulster Unionist Party led by Baird with Empey as Deputy Leader.W.D.

Maguire was challenged by Austin Currie, a local SDLP activist (and later official candidate) who disagreed with the party's decision to give Maguire a clear run, while the new Ulster Unionist candidate, Raymond Ferguson, was challenged by Ernest Baird, leader of the United Ulster Unionist Party, who sought to cement his new party's electoral position.
