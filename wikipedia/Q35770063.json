This support began in the early 1840s and was led by Lord Palmerston, following the occupation of Syria and Palestine by separatist Ottoman governor Muhammad Ali of Egypt. French influence had grown in Palestine and the wider Middle East, and its role as protector of the Catholic communities began to grow, just as Russian influence had grown as protector of the Eastern Orthodox in the same regions. This left Britain without a sphere of influence, and thus a need to find or create their own regional \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\". These political considerations were supported by a sympathetic evangelical Christian sentiment towards the \"restoration of the Jews\" to Palestine among elements of the mid-19th-century British political elite \u2013 most notably Lord Shaftesbury.

Although Britain forced Muhammad Ali to withdraw to Egypt, the Levant was left for a brief time without a government.
