Furthermore, he began aggressively asserting his claims over Lombardy, and in 1159 the Diet of Roncaglia issued a series of decrees claiming extensive lands in north Italy. This caused sufficient concern that the cities of Milan\u2014which Barbarossa had already \"half-destroyed\", says Ullmann\u2014Brescia, Piacenza and Crema (which had also suffered a \"brutal siege\", notes Duggan) approached Adrian for aid. Since the lands concerned were part of the Papal fiefdom, Adrian, in Bologna, rejected Barbarossa's claim and gave him 40 days in which to withdraw them, on pain of excommunication. However, Adrian's intervention in a quarrel between the Emperor and the Lombard towns may, suggests the classicist Peter Partner, \"may have been inevitable, but it was to be one of the most explosive issues of its age\"."]}, {"page": "Pope Zachary", "response": ["Church historian Johann Peter Kirsch said of Zachary: \"In a troubled era Zachary proved himself to be an excellent, capable, vigorous, and charitable successor of Peter.\" Peter Partner called Zachary a skilled diplomat, \"perhaps the most subtle and able of all the Roman pontiffs, in this dark corridor in which the Roman See hovered just inside the doors of the Byzantine world.\"Partner, Peter.

Peter Partner states in his 1987 book The Knights Templar and their Myth: \"In the trial of the Templars one of their main charges was their supposed worship of a heathen idol-head known as a 'Baphomet' ('Baphomet' = Mahomet).\". The description of the object changed from confession to confession. Some Templars denied any knowledge of it. Others, under torture, described it as being either a severed head, a cat, or a head with three faces.. The Templars did possess several silver-gilt heads as reliquaries,. including one marked capud m, another said to be St. Euphemia,. and possibly the actual head of Hugues de Payens.: \"It is possible that the head mentioned was in fact a reliquary of Hugh of Payns, containing his actual head.\" The claims of an idol named Baphomet were unique to the Inquisition of the Templars.. Karen Ralls, author of the Knights Templar Encyclopedia, argues that it is significant that \"no specific evidence [of Baphomet] appears in either the Templar Rule or in other medieval period Templar documents.\".", "Hammer's essay did not pass unchallenged, and F.\u00a0J.\u00a0M. Raynouard published an  in  the following year.In  (Noted by Barber 1994, p. 393, note 13.) An abridged English translation appears in Michaud, \"Raynouard's note on Hammer's 'Mysterium Baphometi Revelatum'\", pp.\u00a0494\u2013500. Charles William King criticized Hammer, saying that he had been deceived by \"the paraphernalia of\u00a0... Rosicrucian or alchemical quacks\", and Peter Partner agreed that the images \"may have been forgeries from the occultist workshops\".. At the very least, there was little evidence to tie them to the Knights Templar\u2014in the 19th century some European museums acquired such pseudo-Egyptian objects, which were cataloged as \"Baphomets\" and credulously thought to have been idols of the Templars.Hans Tietze illustrated one, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, in  p. 1."]}, {"page": "History of the Knights Templar", "response": ["Debate continues as to whether the accusation of religious heresy had merit by the standards of the time. Under torture, some Templars admitted to sodomy and to the worship of heads and an idol known as Baphomet.  Their leaders later denied these admissions, and for that were executed. Some scholars, such as Malcolm Barber, Helen Nicholson and Peter Partner, discount these as forced admissions, typical during the Medieval Inquisition.", "* Peter Partner, The Knights Templar and their Myth, Destiny Books; Reissue edition, 1990.
