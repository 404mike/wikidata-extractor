Conradi's 2001 biography was the fruit of long research and authorised access to journals and other papers.  It is also a labour of love, and of a friendship with Murdoch that extended from a meeting at her Gifford Lectures to her death.  The book was well received. John Updike commented: \"There would be no need to complain of literary biographies [...] if they were all as good\". The text addresses many popular questions about Murdoch, such as how Irish she was, what her politics were, etc.  Though not a trained philosopher, Conradi's interest in Murdoch's achievement as a thinker is evident in the biography, and yet more so in his earlier work of literary criticism The Saint and the Artist: A Study of Iris Murdoch's Works (Macmillan 1986, HarperCollins 2001).  He also recalled his personal encounters with Murdoch in Going Buddhist: Panic and Emptiness, the Buddha and Me. (Short Books, 2005).

Conradi describes A Fairly Honourable Defeat as a \"brilliant and decisive masterpiece\", and the novel with which she entered a \"new artistic maturity\" in which plot and characters are equally balanced. Literary scholars have examined various aspects of the novel, including its attempt to portray, in Tallis, an \"interesting\" good character, and its sympathetic depiction of a loving and stable homosexual relationship only three years after the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 decriminalized private sexual acts between adult men."]}, {"page": "Franz Baermann Steiner", "response": ["His family was exterminated during the Holocaust. His health in the last decade, due to stress and poverty, was always delicate. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1946, and a coronary thrombosis in 1949. He died of a heart attack, while speaking to an acquaintance over the phone, in 1952, just after Iris Murdoch had accepted his proposal of marriage. She attributed his death to the effects of the Holocaust, remarking that \"Franz was certainly one of Hitler's victims\". Peter J. Conradi wrote that Steiner never recovered from the sadness he felt when his parents were murdered in a concentration camp. According to Conradi, Murdoch's portraits of such positive figures in her fiction as Peter Saward (The Flight from the Enchanter, 1956), Willy Jost (The Nice and the Good, 1968) and Tallis Browne (A Fairly Honourable Defeat, 1970) were inspired by her memories of Franz Steiner."]}, {"page": "Yorick Smythies", "response": ["Ray Monk's claim (repeated by Peter J. Conradi and Valerie Purton) that Smythies suffered from (paranoid) schizophrenia is disputed by Volker A. Munz. Neither Monk nor Munz offer any explanation for why Smythies might been thought to suffer from this condition, nor, accordingly, does Munz offer any alternative diagnosis. Conradi however identifies a \"schizophrenic breakdown\" as the cause of Yorick 'hiding behind trees' and \"making strange utterances\" and mentions time spent by him in a mental hospital. An explanation is offered by Yorick's first cousin, the neuropsychiatrist J. R. Smythies who, also disputing Monk's claims of schizophrenia, claimed that, prescribed amphetamines for depression, Yorick Smythies became dependent on them and subsequently developed a \"wholly iatrogenic\" chronic paranoid amphetamine psychosis."]}, {"page": "The Unicorn (novel)", "response": ["The novel's dramatic plot and remote setting are characteristic of Gothic fiction. Murdoch biographer and critic Peter J. Conradi notes the author's effective use of \"the stage props and scenery of the Romantic sublime\", including massive cliffs overlooking a dangerous sea, isolated castles, mysterious megaliths, and a deadly bog containing carnivorous plants."]}, {"page": "The Message to the Planet", "response": ["The Message to the Planet, Iris Murdoch's twenty-fourth novel, continues the exploration of some of the themes familiar from her earlier works. Marcus Vallar is a charismatic and masterful \"enchanter\" figure, a type featured in many of her novels. According to her biographer Peter J. Conradi, Iris Murdoch said that the character of Marcus Vallar was based on Georg Kreisel. Conradi also notes that Murdoch's seven last novels all deal with the death of a \"wise older man\", in this case Vallar. In common with other Murdoch novels, The Message to the Planet also explores the relationship between a master and his disciple, Vallar and Ludens respectively."]}, {"page": "The Sacred and Profane Love Machine", "response": ["The title is a reference to Titian's painting Sacred and Profane Love, which was used as the basis for the first edition's cover. Peter J. Conradi notes that Titian's painting is a \"puzzle painting\" in that a single model is shown both nude and elaborately dressed, so that the boundary between sacred and profane love is unclear. Rather, they are presented as \"cases of a single principle of Eros in two different modes of existence and in two grades of perfection\"."]}, {"page": "The Nice and the Good", "response": ["Later writers have dealt with the ideas discussed in The Nice and the Good, and the way they inform the characters' behaviour, often in relation to other Murdoch novels. Peter J. Conradi notes that The Nice and the Good, an \" 'open' and benignly comic\" novel, contrasts sharply with its \" 'closed' and apocalyptic\" predecessor The Time of the Angels. \"Open\" and \"closed\" refer to Murdoch's own way of classifying novels as either driven by character (open) or by plot (closed). Writers on theology have been particularly interested in how The Nice and the Good, among other Murdoch novels, relates to the question of morality in a post-religious age."]}, {"page": "The Sovereignty of Good", "response": ["Iris Murdoch's main influence in The Sovereignty of Good is Plato, at a time when,  as her biographer Peter J. Conradi notes, to be \"a Platonist in morals seemed as bizarre as declaring oneself a Jacobite in politics\". Simone Weil, whose Notebooks Murdoch had reviewed in 1956, was an important influence on Murdoch's reading of Plato and on her philosophy generally. Weil's concept of \"attention\" to reality, including both other people and a transcendent Good, provided Murdoch with an alternative to the conventional view of an autonomous free agent's actions as the basis of morality."]}, {"page": "Henry and Cato", "response": ["Plato's Allegory of the Cave provides the novel's central metaphor for vision and moral change. According to Peter J. Conradi, Henry wants to renounce the world and live in the sun, while Cato, having lost his faith, is trying to return to the cave.  Cato's sudden conversion is described in Platonic terms, as he feels \"as if he had not only emerged from the cave, but was looking at the Sun and finding that it was easy to look at\". Suguna Ramanathan, in her study of Murdoch's fiction, observes that this description points to a lack of authenticity in his conversion. In Plato's account, the Good, of which the sun is a symbol, is painful to look at unless one has prepared oneself by long and serious effort. \"In this case, either it is not the sun, or Cato is looking at it through the protecting glass of his romantic nature\"."]}, {"page": "An Accidental Man", "response": ["Literary scholars have also viewed An Accidental Man as a comic novel, and in various ways as a departure from Murdoch's earlier work. In his study of Iris Murdoch's fiction, Peter J. Conradi calls An Accidental Man \"marvellous\" for its combination of \"moral passion and idealism\" with \"absence of illusion and moral skepticism\", which results in an dryly ironic tone reminiscent of Henry James's The Awkward Age. Angela Hague describes the novel as a \"brittle comedy of manners\" and says that Murdoch's purpose was to create a \"Dickensian sweep of characters\". Frank Baldanza compares An Accidental Man with Murdoch's previous novel A Fairly Honourable Defeat. Both display \"trenchant irony\" about the ineffectuality of conventionally good and well-meaning characters. In the earlier novel they were frustrated by the schemes of a demonic individual, while An Accidental Man impersonal chance takes on this role. In her study of Murdoch's fiction Hilda Spear includes it in a group of novels that are \"deeply concerned with the problems of Good and Evil\". She sees the structure of the novel, with its loose narration interspersed with letter sections, as both a major departure for Murdoch and evidence of her \"genuine narrative skills\"."]}, {"page": "The Time of the Angels", "response": ["Other important themes are \"the abuse of power and sexual domination\", both embodied in Carel Fisher, who has been described as one of Murdoch's \"most convincingly evil character(s)\". Carel is presented as a demonic Faust-like character who has \"rejected redemption\" by denying the existence of both God and Good. Murdoch biographer and literary critic Peter J. Conradi notes that incest and theft, which are committed by Carel and Leo Peshkov respectively in The Time of the Angels, are used by Murdoch as \"paradigm forms of law-breaking\" in several of her novels."]}, {"page": "Brian H.
