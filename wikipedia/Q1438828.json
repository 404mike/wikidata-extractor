Rudge attempted to sign one of West Ham United's defensive pair Gary Strodder and Paul Hilton, but found their neither were willing to join the club. Unaffected by this rejection, the \"Valiants\" beat third-place Swansea City 2\u20131, though were disappointed to lose Futcher as the striker was sent off for arguing with the linesman. They then disposed of Fulham with a 3\u20130 win, despite having to play without Futcher.
