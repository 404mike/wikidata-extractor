Blomberg 2009  pages 434\u2013435 Blomberg adds that after the removal of these three elements (which are likely interpolations) from the Greek versions the remaining passage fits well with the Arabic version and supports the authenticity of the reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate. Joel B. Green also states that the removal of some elements from the Testimonium produces a passage that is likely to be an authentic reference to the death of Jesus.Joel B.

Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , p. 526. The rejoicing of the shepherd with his friends represents God rejoicing with the angels.

The description of the woman suggests that she is a known prostitute,Carol Ann Newsom and Sharon H. Ringe, Women's Bible Commentary, Westminster John Knox Press, 1998, , p. 374. although this inference is disputed. If she is a prostitute, her presence defiles the Pharisee's ritual purity. Joel B.

Green suggests that the question that opens the parable (\"Which of you who has a friend...?\" also expressible as \"Can you imagine...?\") is intended to be answered as an emphatic \"No!\", since no friend would refuse to help under such circumstances (the opening words in Greek occur elsewhere in Luke, but have no contemporary parallels, and I. Howard Marshall regards them as probably characteristic of Jesus himself). However, Jesus goes on to point out that even if friendship wasn't a big enough motivation, help would still be forthcoming.
