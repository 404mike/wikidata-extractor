The great majority of military historians, including Peter Fleming, Derek Robinson and Stephen Bungay, have expressed the opinion that it had little chance of success and would have most likely resulted in a disaster for the Germans. Fleming states it is doubtful whether history offers any better example of a victor so nearly offering his vanquished foe an opportunity of inflicting on him a resounding defeat. Len Deighton and some other writers have called the German amphibious plans a \"Dunkirk in reverse\".Deighton, Len (1980) Battle of Britain London: Jonathan Cape,  Robinson argues the massive superiority of the Royal Navy over the Kriegsmarine would have made Sea Lion a disaster. Dr Andrew Gordon, in an article for the Royal United Services Institute JournalRUSI Journal,  (retrieved 27 December 2017) agrees with this and is clear in his conclusion the German Navy was never in a position to mount Sealion, regardless of any realistic outcome of the Battle of Britain. In his fictional alternate history Invasion: the German invasion of England, July 1940, Kenneth Macksey proposes that the Germans might have succeeded if they had swiftly and decisively begun preparations even before the Dunkirk evacuations, and the Royal Navy for some reason had held back from large-scale intervention,Macksey 1990, pp. 144\u201346. though in practice the Germans were unprepared for such a speedy commencement of their assault.Macksey 1990, pp. 209\u201310 The German official naval war historian, Vice Admiral Kurt Assmann, wrote in 1958: \"Had the German Air Force defeated the Royal Air Force as decisively as it had defeated the French Air Force a few months earlier, I am sure Hitler would have given the order for the invasion to be launched \u2013 and the invasion would in all probability been smashed\"."]}, {"page": "Battle of Britain", "response": ["Historian Stephen Bungay cited Germany's failure to destroy Britain's air defences to force an armistice (or even an outright surrender) as the first major German defeat in the Second World War and a crucial turning point in the conflict. The Battle of Britain takes its name from the speech given by Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the House of Commons on 18 June: \"What General Weygand called the 'Battle of France' is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin.\"", "The effect of the German attacks on airfields is unclear. According to Stephen Bungay, Dowding, in a letter to Hugh Trenchardthe PRO, AIR 19/60. accompanying Park's report on the period 8 August \u2013 10 September 1940, states that the Luftwaffe \"achieved very little\" in the last week of August and the first week of September. The only Sector Station to be shut down operationally was Biggin Hill, and it was non-operational for just two hours. Dowding admitted 11 Group's efficiency was impaired but, despite serious damage to some airfields, only two out of 13 heavily attacked airfields were down for more than a few hours. The German refocus on London was not critical.", "Overall, by 2 November, the RAF fielded 1,796 pilots, an increase of over 40% from July 1940's count of 1,259 pilots. Based on German sources (from a Luftwaffe intelligence officer Otto Bechtle attached to KG 2 in February 1944) translated by the Air Historical Branch, Stephen Bungay asserts German fighter and bomber \"strength\" declined without recovery, and that from August\u2013December 1940, the German fighter and bomber strength declined by 30 and 25 percent. In contrast, Williamson Murray argues (using translations by the Air Historical Branch) that 1,380 German bombers were on strength on 29 June 1940, 1,420 bombers on 28 September, 1,423 level bombers on 2 November and 1,393 bombers on 30 November 1940. In July\u2013September the number of Luftwaffe pilots available fell by 136, but the number of operational pilots had shrunk by 171 by September. The training organisation of the Luftwaffe was failing to replace losses. German fighter pilots, in contrast to popular perception, were not afforded training or rest rotations, unlike their British counterparts. The first week of September accounted for 25% of Fighter Command's and 24% of the Luftwaffe's overall losses. Between the dates 26 August \u2013 6 September, on only one day (1 September) did the Germans destroy more aircraft than they lost. Losses were 325 German and 248 British.", "There is a consensus among historians that the Luftwaffe was unable to crush the RAF. Stephen Bungay describes Dowding and Park's strategy of choosing when to engage the enemy whilst maintaining a coherent force as vindicated; their leadership, and the subsequent debates about strategy and tactics, had created enmity among RAF senior commanders and both were sacked from their posts in the immediate aftermath of the battle. All things considered, the RAF proved to be a robust and capable organisation that was to use all the modern resources available to it to the maximum advantage. Richard Evans writes:"]}, {"page": "Hans-Joachim Marseille", "response": ["Some serious discrepancies between Allied squadron records and German claims have caused some historians and Allied veterans to question the accuracy of Marseille's official victories, in addition to those of JG\u00a027 as a whole. Attention is often focused on the 26 claims made by JG\u00a027 on 1 September 1942, of which 17 were claimed by Marseille alone. A USAF historian, Major Robert Tate states: \"[f]or years, many British historians and militarists refused to admit that they had lost any aircraft that day in North Africa. Careful review of records however do show that the British [and South Africans] did lose more than 17 aircraft that day, and in the area that Marseille operated.\"Tate, Major Robert (USAF). \"Hans-Joachim Marseille\". Tate also reveals 20 RAF single-engined fighters and one twin engined fighter were destroyed and several others severely damaged, as well as a further USAAF P-40 shot down. However, overall Tate reveals that Marseille's kill total comes close to 65\u201370 percent corroboration, indicating as many as 50 of his claims may not have actually been kills. Tate also compares Marseille\u2019s rate of corroboration with the top six P-40 pilots. While only the Canadian James Francis Edwards' records shows a verification of 100 percent other aces like Clive Caldwell (50% to 60% corroboration), Billy Drake (70% to 80% corroboration), John Lloyd Waddy (70% to 80% corroboration) and Andrew Barr (60% to 70% corroboration) are at the same order of magnitude as Marseille's claims. Christopher Shores and Hans Ring also support Tate's conclusions. British historian Stephen Bungay gives a figure of 20 Allied losses that day."]}, {"page": "Ray Holmes", "response": ["Over the years, several sources began perpetuating the myth that Holmes purposefully crashed into the Dornier and that the German plane was attempting to bomb the palace. However, this account has been challenged by modern scholars, most notably by Alfred Price and Stephen Bungay for its many errors and inaccuracies. In fact, eyewitness accounts have been uncovered which mention that the Dornier was empty when it was rammed. According to sources, Zehbe developed engine trouble and lagged half a mile behind the main bomber stream. His Dornier attracted a swarm of fighters and had already been damaged, Goschenhofer and Hobel had been killed and then he and the remainder bailed out; Armbruster bailed out over Sydenham, and Hammermeister bailed out over Dulwich. As Zehbe bailed out, he set the aircraft on autopilot.Price, Alfred. The Battle of Britain Day, Greenhill Books, London, 1990, pp. 49\u201350 and Stephen Bungay, The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain. Aurum Press, London, 2000, p. 325. His Dornier flew on empty until Holmes rammed it. During its spinning dive, the gravitational force on the Dornier caused its bombs to be released, which hit or landed near to the Palace nearby, damaging the building.Bungay 2000, p. 325. In addition, Holmes' combat report of the day makes no mention of an intended collision with the Dornier. In his combat report, he reported that he had made four attacks on the Dornier. He mentioned seeing a lone crewmember bail out as he made his third attack and, during the last pass, he felt a \"jar\" which caused his aircraft to fall into an uncontrollable spin, and that he first believed the Dornier exploded beneath him, before seeing it crash while he was on his parachute. Over the years, this apparent unintended \"jar\" seems to have been transformed into an intentional collision."]}, {"page": "Bungay (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Stephen Bungay (born 1954), British management consultant, military historian and author"]}, {"page": "Mission command", "response": ["* Stephen Bungay: Moltke \u2013 Master of Modern Management"]}, {"page": "Paterson Clarence Hughes", "response": ["Hughes was promoted to acting flight lieutenant in November 1939 and became a flight commander in the newly formed No.\u00a0234 Squadron, which, like No.\u00a064 Squadron, came under the control of No.\u00a013 Group in the north of England.Alexander, Australia's Few, pp. viii, 90, 127 On establishment the previous month at RAF Leconfield, East Yorkshire, No.\u00a0234 Squadron was equipped with Blenheims, Fairey Battles and Gloster Gauntlets; it began re-arming with Supermarine Spitfires in March 1940 and was operational two months later.
