Wadsworth, so loathed Labour's left-wing champion Aneurin Bevan, who had made a reference to getting rid of \"Tory Vermin\" in a speech \"and the hate-gospellers of his entourage\" that it encouraged readers to vote Conservative in the 1951 general election and remove Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government. The newspaper opposed the creation of the National Health Service as it feared the state provision of healthcare would \"eliminate selective elimination\" and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people.", "In October 1952, the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space.

Manuscripts, commonplace books and scrapbooks (18 volumes) went to Chetham's Library. Other manuscripts came into the hands of A. P. Wadsworth, whose daughter Janet gave them in 1957 to the John Rylands Library. These scrapbooks, mostly consisting of newspaper cuttings, are in some ways comparable with those of the Yorkshire antiquarian and diarist Dorothy Richardson (1748\u20131819). Hay's interests included poetry, trivia and the local volunteer corps. The scrapbooks were maintained in parallel with commonplace books. The scrapbooks and other papers were given by Hay's daughter Mary, after his death, to Francis Robert Raines."]}]}}
