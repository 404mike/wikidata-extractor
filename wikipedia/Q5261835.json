Derek Brewer (1960: 104) then argues that the date of 1382, as opposed to that of 1374, is much more likely for the composition of the poem since, during the same period (1373\u201385), Chaucer wrote many other works including The House of Fame which, in all respects, seems to have been composed earlier than The Parliament of Fowls, thus: \"a very reasonable, if not certain, date for the Parlement is that it was begun in May 1382, and was ready for St. Valentine's Day, 14th February 1383\" (Brewer, 1960: 104). Although much of the criticism on the interpretation of The Parliament of Foules\u2014 which would render clues for its date of composition\u2014is contradictory, and criticism about the importance of line 117 does not agree on whether it can be taken as serious evidence for the dating of the poem, there is nowadays a general agreement among scholars as to 1381\u20131382 being the date of composition for The Parliament of Foules."]}, {"page": "G.

In 1948, she presented a paper at a meeting of Oxford's Socratic Club in which she disputed C.\u00a0S. Lewis's argument that naturalism was self-refuting (found in the third chapter of the original publication of his book Miracles). Some associates of Lewis, primarily George Sayer and Derek Brewer, have remarked that Lewis lost the subsequent debate on her paper and that this loss was so humiliating that he abandoned theological argument and turned entirely to devotional writing and children's literature. This is a claim disputed by Walter Hooper and Anscombe's impression of the effect upon Lewis was somewhat different:"]}, {"page": "Boydell & Brewer", "response": ["The company was co-founded by historians Richard Barber and Derek Brewer in 1978, merging the two companies Boydell Press and D.S.
