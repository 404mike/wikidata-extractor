He gained his MA at Karnatak, his PhD from Gauhati University in 1966 under the guidance of Jyotiprasad Medhi, and DSc from Manchester in 1988. He was a specialist in time series analysis especially non-stationary and non-linear time series analysis, higher order spectral analysis, theory of random fields, time series methods for analysis of environmental variables (detection of climatic changes etc.)  and multivariate nonlinear models. The Subba Rao\u2013Liporace models, and Subba Rao Gabr window for bivariate spectra are named after him.Subba Rao retired, but was given an emeritus chair, in 2009 having worked at UMIST and the University of Manchester for 42 years. He published over 70 papers and supervised 15 PhD students. Even after retirement he remained active.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester", "response": ["With the rapid expansion of higher education and the starting of an undergraduate mathematics degree this changed, and by 1968 the 15-storey Maths and Social Sciences Building (MSS) was completed on UMIST campus to house the growing department. In 1960 Robin Bullough joined the UMIST department initiating four decades of mathematical physics focusing especially on solitons. The statistics group also grew in strength with an emphasis on time series, led by Maurice Priestley and also Tata Subba Rao. In 1986 pure mathematics at UMIST was strengthened by the appointment of Martin J. Taylor FRS, famous for his work on properties and structures of algebraic numbers."]}, {"page": "Subbarao", "response": ["* Tata Subba Rao (born 1942), British statistician"]}, {"page": "Maurice Priestley", "response": ["Maurice Bertram Priestley (15 March 1933\u00a0\u2013 15 June 2013Tata Subba Rao and Granville Tunnicliffe-Wilson, Obituary: Maurice Priestley 1933\u20132013, IMS Bulletin on line 29 August 2013) was a professor of statistics in the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester.

However, in the same year Gauhati University was established and he was invited to work as Professor in Gauhati University. Accepting the invitation, he joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics as a Lecturer. In between his tenure, he had taken MS degree from England and DSc from Paris. Medhi returned to Gauhati University where he became a Professor and was the Head of the department of Statistics till he retired in 1985. Earlier in Gauhati University, both Mathematics and Statistics were in a common department, however, under the able leadership of Prof Medhi, Statistics became a full-fledged individual department. In 1987, two years after retirement, he was entitled the honour of Professor Emeritus at the same university and remained so until his demise in 2017. Under his guidance, several students got Doctoral degrees and Tata Subba Rao is the first among them. From Southern India, Subba Rao had come to Assam to pursue his research under Prof Medhi and later he had joined Manchester University as a Professor. In 1979, he established the 'Population Research Centre' and served as a Director. He played a prominent role in shaping the newly formed Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology, Assam, IASST by serving as Director."]}]}}
