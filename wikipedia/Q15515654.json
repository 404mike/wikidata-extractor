In May 1990, Tu\u0111man said that Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina \"form a geographic and political whole, and in the course of history they were generally in a single united state\", but suggested that its citizens should \"decide their own fate through a referendum\". He doubted that Bosnia and Herzegovina could survive the dissolution of Yugoslavia, but supported its integrity if it remained outside a Yugoslav federation and Serbian influence. In his official statements, Tu\u0111man advocated for an integral Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to Sabrina P. Ramet, it was done in an effort to confuse foreign audiences of his intents and placate the international community. Tu\u0111man supported Croatia's territorial integrity, but held that the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina were open to negotiation. His stance was emboldened by the unclear and confusing policy of the international community regarding the Bosnian war and the Serb held areas in Croatia. British historian Mark Almond wrote that \"almost all respectable international opinion [...] doubted the viability and legitimacy of an integral Bosnia and Herzegovina.\" Interpretations of Tu\u0111man's actions go from statements that he behaved as a rational opportunist, to claims that he had from the outset a collaborationist policy with the Serbs on the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an aim of ethnic cleansing, whereas others call that an assumption with no convincing evidence, arguing that if Croats and Serbs had been jointly waging a war against Bosniaks, there would have been no Bosnia and Herzegovina."]}, {"page": "Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2013Tu\u0111man Kara\u0111or\u0111evo meeting", "response": ["British historian Mark Almond wrote in 2003 that \"this meeting has attained mythical status in the conspiracy theory literature which equates Tu\u0111man and Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as partners in crime in the demonology of the Balkan conflict.
