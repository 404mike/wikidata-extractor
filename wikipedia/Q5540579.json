In November Fred Mitcheson was sold to Plymouth to raise funds for new players. George Heywood was promptly signed from Altrincham for \u00a3250. Heywood made his debut on 23 November, as Vale suffered a 9\u20132 demolition at the City Ground to Nottingham Forest. Forest were only kept from double figures by 'many fine saves' from Potts. On 7 December, a 2\u20130 loss at Belle Vue from Doncaster Rovers sent Vale to the foot of the table. As a result of this, the club put in a large bid for Wigan Athletic's Jack Roberts, and consequently signed the highly promising forward. Meanwhile, injuries and constant rotation of the first eleven worked against the team. A 4\u20130 defeat from West Ham United at Upton Park on 21 December was followed by the club's first away win in sixteen attempts five days later. The win came over a poor Hull City side in ankle deep mud. Two days later and Barnsley beat Vale 4\u20130 at \"The Rec\", which would again have fatal consequences come May.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| George Heywood"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with two defeats, as Vale found it tough to acclimatize to third tier football, their 3\u20131 home defeat to Hull City came despite them doing the double over the \"Tigers\" the previous season. Following this, George Stabb transferred to Bradford Park Avenue, in a deal which saw Tom Nolan return to The Old Recreation Ground. Continuing their poor form, by the end of September they were seventh from bottom. This prompted Cresswell to sign inside-forward Alfred Dickinson from Everton. On 26 September, Nolan scored a hat-trick past Stockport County, but the Vale would have to wait a little longer before getting into their stride. Seven changes were made for the 24 October win over Hartlepools United, and the wait would be worth it, as Vale then went on a thirteen-game unbeaten run. Nevertheless, Cresswell continued to travel the country in the hunt for talented young amateurs. By the end of October the 40,000 Shilling Fund completed its mission. With Ward scoring two hat-tricks during the spell, Michael Curley and George Heywood were judged as surplus to requirements, and moved on to Colwyn Bay and Southport respectively. Fred Obrey also proved to be a revelation in the centre of the pitch.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| George Heywood"]}, {"page": "George Hayward", "response": ["* George Heywood (1907\u20131985), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Heywood, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Heywood"]}]}}
