Its theme tune was written by Gary Kemp and performed by Spandau Ballet. It was produced and directed by Michael Hurll. Initially, the show struggled in the ratings and seemed unlikely to survive beyond its first series. Original co-host Leni Harper was dismissed after the third show and various revamps took place to bolster the ratings. Eventually, the inclusion of some of the biggest names in the music business as special guests helped raise the profile and ratings for the show."]}, {"page": "Gary Wilmot", "response": ["Wilmot started his career in entertainment after a friend informed an agent of his talent, and soon began to perform as part of the variety circuit.
