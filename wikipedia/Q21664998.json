He was also a member of the British Socialist Party (BSP), who put him forward as their proposed candidate for Bradford East at the election which was expected to take place in 1914 or 1915.  However, this was against the wishes of local BSP activists, and he failed to gain the support of the local Independent Labour Party.Long active on the London Trades Council, Stokes replaced his BSP comrade Fred Knee as its secretary in 1914, serving for three years.  Also in 1914, the BSP affiliated to the Labour Party, and Stokes immediately took a leading role in founding the London Labour Party, serving as its first Chairman.Although Stokes strongly opposed conscription during World War I, he did not oppose the war overall.  This placed him on the right-wing of the BSP, and in 1916 he joined several other leading figures in splitting away to form the National Socialist Party (NSP).Stokes remained secretary of his union, while also becoming chair of the National Federation of Glass Workers and Kindred Trade Unions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Stokes", "response": ["John Stokes may refer to:", "*John Stokes (MP for Derby), Member of Parliament (MP) Derby", "*John Stokes (fl.1547), MP for Westbury", "*John Stokes (Conservative politician) (1917\u20132003), British Conservative MP 1970\u20131992", "*John Stokes (North Carolina judge) (1756\u20131790), North Carolina attorney, politician, and judge", "*John Stoke (MP), also known as John Stokes", "*John Stokes (1915\u20131990), principal of Queen's College, Hong Kong, buried in Wolvercote Cemetery", "*John Stokes (born 1940), Irish musician with The Bachelors", "*John Stokes (comics), British comic artist who drew stories including Fishboy, Marney and The Invisibles", "*John Stokes (cinematographer) (born 1961), Australian cinematographer, see Hurricane Smith", "*John Stokes (Medal of Honor) (1871\u20131923), American Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Stokes (Archdeacon of York) (died 1568), president of Queens' College, Cambridge", "*John Stokes (Irish mathematician) (1720\u20131781), Irish mathematician", "*John Stokes (priest) (died 1503), Canon of Windsor and Warden of All Souls College, Oxford", "*John Stokes (trade unionist) (c. 1865\u20131935), leader of the London Labour Party and London Trades Council", "*John Stokes (mountaineer) (1945\u20132016), British Army soldier and mountaineer", "*John Stokes (Archdeacon of Armagh) (1801\u20131885)", "*John Stokes (surveyor) (fl. 1850s), New Zealand cartographer and explorer", "*John Stokes (bishop) (14th - 15th century), see Bishop of Kilmore"]}, {"page": "Bradford East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*British Socialist Party: John Stokes"]}, {"page": "London Trades Council", "response": [":1914: John Stokes", ":1913: John Stokes (Glassblowers)", ":1917: John Stokes (Glassblowers)"]}, {"page": "British Socialist Party", "response": ["| John Stokes"]}, {"page": "London Labour", "response": [":1915: John Stokes"]}, {"page": "National Socialist Party (UK)", "response": ["Other prominent members included Henry W.
