He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1883, Prittie was appointed High Sheriff of Tipperary. He succeeded his father as fourth Baron Dunalley in 1885 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1891 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer, which he remained until his death. Lord Dunalley also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Tipperary from 1905 to 1922. He died in August 1927, aged 76, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Henry.\nHe was the owner of 'Countess' a 15-ton yacht on Lough Derg from 1893 to 1919.\nHe was Commodore of the Lough Derg Yacht Club from 1905 until his death in 1927.\nHe married Mary Frances Farmer (10 August 1857 \u2013 18 May 1929) daughter of Reginald Onslow Farmer (1828\u20131904) on 22 August 1876 at Hatfield Hertfordshire.
