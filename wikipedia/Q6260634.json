However, that result was declared void on 28 February 1853 after an election petition, and on 28 May 1853 Aspinall won the resulting by-election by a margin of 215 votes to 208. The by-election result was immediately denounced by the agent of the Liberal Party candidate, on the grounds that Aspinall was ineligible due to bribery in the previous contest, and bribery had taken place again. A petition was lodged, and after the committee found that bribery had taken place on Aspinall's behalf, his election was voided on 1 August 1853. He did not stand for Parliament again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Aspinall", "response": ["John Aspinall may refer to:", "* John Aspinall (zoo owner) (1926\u20132000), English zoo owner and gambler", "* John Aspinall (engineer) (1851\u20131937), English engineer", "* John Aspinall (politician) (c. 1815\u20131865), English Conservative Party politician, Member of Parliament for Clitheroe 1853", "* John Aspinall (footballer) (born 1959), English footballer", "* John Aspinall (cricketer) (1877\u20131932), Irish cricketer"]}, {"page": "Aspinwall (surname)", "response": ["* John Aspinall (politician) (c. 1815 \u2013 1865), English politician", "* John Aspinall (engineer), (1851\u20131937) English engineer", "* John Aspinall (zoo owner), (1926\u20132000) English zoo owner and gambler", "* John Aspinall (footballer) (born 1959), English footballer"]}, {"page": "John Thomas Walshman Aspinall", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Aspinall (politician)"]}, {"page": "John Aspinall (Conservative politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Aspinall (politician)"]}]}}
