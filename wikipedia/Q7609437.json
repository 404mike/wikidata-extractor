He was also a soldier, MI6 operative, Master of Foxhounds and author.\nThe son of a Southern Rhodesian farmer, Hastings had visited the country only briefly as a young child, but he grew up with tales of the veldt and the farm. A year after he was elected to Parliament, he accepted an invitation from the British South Africa Company to visit the country, and from then on made frequent visits, getting to know the leading white politicians. Over the next 20 years, Hastings devoted his political energies to injecting what he felt was much needed balance into the debate about Rhodesia's future. When Rhodesia's Prime Minister, Ian Smith, unilaterally declared the independence of Rhodesia in 1964, Hastings was a prominent member of the Rhodesia lobby opposing sanctions \u2013 against the official party line.\nFourteen years later, he strongly supported the Internal Settlement between Smith and the moderate nationalist leaders under which Bishop Abel Muzorewa became Prime Minister, though effective power remained in white hands. He saw the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which created an independent Zimbabwe and led to Robert Mugabe's election, as a disaster caused by \"unnecessary deference to the delusion of the Commonwealth, the Afro-Asian lobby and to the Americans by a series of British governments\".\nAlthough Hastings claimed to have been invited to join Edward Heath's administration, his stance on Rhodesia effectively rendered him ineligible for office. Even Margaret Thatcher, whom he counted as an ally, kept him on the backbenches, though she recommended him for a knighthood in 1983. In his latter years at his Cambridgeshire home, Stibbington House, the only person whose photographs were displayed in more than one room (apart from those of his beloved late wife, Elizabeth Anne) were those of Smith.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conservative Monday Club", "response": ["* Stephen Hastings (Mid Bedfordshire)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Stephen Hastings"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Stephen Hastings"]}, {"page": "George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe", "response": ["In October 1939, the young Jellicoe was a cadet in the first wartime intake at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.Windmill, Lorna Almonds.
