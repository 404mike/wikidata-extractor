Revered by high Tories who considered him a saintly martyr, he was condemned by Whig historians, such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner, who thought him duplicitous and delusional.; . In recent decades, most historians have criticised him,; ; . the main exception being Kevin Sharpe who offered a more sympathetic view of Charles that has not been widely adopted.; ; . While Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience, Professor Barry Coward thought Charles \"was the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI\", a view shared by Ronald Hutton, who called him \"the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages\".Quoted in "]}, {"page": "Oliver Cromwell", "response": ["Cromwell is one of the most controversial figures in British and Irish history, considered a regicidal dictator by historians such as David Sharp, a military dictator by Winston Churchill, a bourgeois revolutionary by Leon Trotsky, and a hero of liberty by John Milton, Thomas Carlyle, and Samuel Rawson Gardiner. His tolerance of Protestant sects did not extend to Catholics, and the measures taken by him against Catholics, particularly in Ireland, have been characterised by some as genocidal or near-genocidal,Genocidal or near-genocidal: Brendan O'Leary and John McGarry, \"Regulating nations and ethnic communities\", in Breton Albert (ed.) (1995). Nationalism and Rationality, Cambridge University Press. p. 248. and his record is strongly criticised in Ireland, although the worst atrocities took place after he had returned to England.Lenihan 2000, p. 1022; \"After Cromwell returned to England in 1650, the conflict degenerated into a grindingly slow counter-insurgency campaign punctuated by some quite protracted sieges...the famine of 1651 onwards was a man-made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare. Collective reprisals against the civilian population included forcing them out of designated 'no man's lands' and the systematic destruction of foodstuffs\". He was selected as one of the ten greatest Britons of all time in a 2002 BBC poll.", "During the early 19th century, Cromwell began to be portrayed in a positive light by Romantic artists and poets. Thomas Carlyle continued this reassessment in the 1840s, publishing an annotated collection of his letters and speeches, and describing English Puritanism as \"the last of all our Heroisms\" while taking a negative view of his own era. By the late 19th century, Carlyle's portrayal of Cromwell had become assimilated into Whig and Liberal historiography, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness. Oxford civil war historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner concluded that \"the man\u2014it is ever so with the noblest\u2014was greater than his work\".Gardiner (1901), p. 315. Gardiner stressed Cromwell's dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, while underestimating Cromwell's religious conviction.Worden, pp. 256\u2013260. Cromwell's foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of Victorian imperial expansion, with Gardiner stressing his \"constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea\".Gardiner (1901), p. 318.

To this Parliament, Gardiner wrote, one can \"trace the first dawning of the idea that, in order to preserve the rights of the subject intact, it would be necessary to make some change in the relations between the authority of the Crown and the representatives of the people.\" Gardiner's judgement of the constitutional import of this assembly has met with the sympathy of some later historians. Moir, in his 1958 monograph on the Parliament, held that \"the development had begun which led ultimately to parliamentary control of the executive\" as early as the exclusion of Parry. Maija Jansson, editor of the 1614 Parliamentary proceedings, wrote in 1988: \"[f]ar from being the confused do-nothing assembly of tradition, the English parliament of 1614 addressed thorny constitutional issues and anticipated the concern with procedure and privilege that is evident throughout the sessions of the 1620s.\""]}, {"page": "1829 in literature", "response": ["*March 4 \u2013 Samuel Rawson Gardiner, English historian (died 1902)"]}, {"page": "George Goring, Lord Goring", "response": ["**Samuel Rawson Gardiner, History of the Great Civil War"]}, {"page": "Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar", "response": ["Gondomar's missions to England were largely dealt with in Samuel Rawson Gardiner's History of England (London, 1883-1884) and more recently in Glyn Redworth, The Prince and the Infanta: The Cultural Politics of the Spanish Match (New Haven, 2003)."]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Samuel Rawson Gardiner (1829\u20131902) \u2013 political history of the 17th century"]}, {"page": "William Watson (priest)", "response": ["*Samuel Rawson Gardiner, History of England, vol. i.
