Halme was brought in as an outsider and billed as a professional boxing champion with his matches billed as Mixed martial arts matches. He was instantly pushed as a big deal, scoring wins over the likes of Scott Norton, Vader and most notably Shinya Hashimoto on December 26, 1990. Halme was main eventing shows regularly as he was pushed as the biggest star of a crew that included the likes of Bobby Eaton, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddy Guerrero and Fit Finlay.

They fought over the WCW World Television Championship until Booker lost the title to Fit Finlay. Booker won a \"Best-of-Seven\" series which was held between the two to determine a number one contender. Benoit went up 3 to 1 before Booker caught up, forcing the 7th and final match on Monday Nitro. During the match, Bret Hart interjected himself, interfering on behalf of Benoit in an attempt to get him to join the New World Order. Benoit refused to win that way and told the referee what happened, getting himself disqualified. Booker refused that victory, instead opting for an eighth match at the Great American Bash to see who would fight Finlay later that night. Booker won the final match and went on to beat Finlay for the title. This feud significantly elevated both men's careers as singles competitors, and both remained at the top of the midcard afterward."]}, {"page": "Scott Hall", "response": ["Scott Hall, as Texas Scott, competed for the Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) at the \"Catch Cup '90\" tournament on December 22, 1990 in Bremen, Germany before 6,000 fans.

In the autumn of 2001, Trish Stratus was trained by Fit Finlay, who was the road agent responsible for the women's matches, and drastically improved her in-ring ability. She worked her way up to the top of the division and eventually won the Women's Championship at Survivor Series. Stratus then entered in a prominent feud with Jazz who debuted at Survivor Series.", "Since May 5, 2002, the women\u2019s division saw an expansion including a departure and a return of a former talent when the WWF officially changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as the company first began to hire more female talents than ever before, including female winners of the reality television show Tough Enough, which featured contestants aspiring to be professional wrestlers (Nidia in 2001, Linda Miles and Jackie Gayda in 2002).

The debuting Gail Kim would go on to become the first woman of Asian descent to have held the WWE Women's Championship after winning a battle royal. Numerous Divas competed in contests ranging from \"Pillow Fights\" and \"Bra and Panties\" match-ups to \"Bikini Contests\", which were based more on the sexual appeal of the women involved. Women's trainer Fit Finlay said he was embarrassed to explain the women how to strip during bra and panties match. According to him, \"It was degrading to them\" and tried to teach them how to wrestle, but WWE told him they do not want women to wrestle like men."]}]}}
