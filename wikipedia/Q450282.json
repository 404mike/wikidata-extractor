His playing within the ensemble was understated and swinging'. Similarly when with an Alyn Shipton quintet in Jazz Ascona Switzerland he showcased a 'fine tribute to Fats Waller'. He continued to tour the UK in between overseas visits and achieved notable success in Bing and Bob, A Tribute to the Crosby Brothers at the Purcell Room London. The late jazz critic Jack Masserik writing of Litton's performance in the Evening Standard noted 'how Martin's knowledge of the styles and development of jazz including Dixieland had been showcased in the octet and that behind the four-man front line, rhythm guitarist Neville Skrimshire tripped a feathery four-to-the bar and pianist Martin Litton strode like a latter-day Joe Sullivan. It was during this time that Litton became noted for his entertaining piano talks, explaining the development of jazz and piano styles before demonstrating by his playing of certain pieces. During this period Litton was approached by the Royal Schools of Music. The introduction of jazz into the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music meant that a new type of jazz book was needed and Charles Beale's guides  were published by the Associated Board itself to which Litton and others in the jazz field contributed by writing test pieces for the student examination board. This aspect of his skill gained wider recognition in programmes for BBC Radio 3 with presenter Alyn Shipton including transmissions of Jazz Library. These latter broadcasts were devoted to the recordings of Morton, Waller and Hines whose piano styles were dissected and commented upon. During  and after this period Litton continued working with Pete Long's Bebop Repertory Quintet playing the music of Dizzy Gillespie as well as being the pianist and musical director for a series of CDs featuring Clare Teal. The first of these CDs 'That's The Way It Is' was highly acclaimed and given regular airplay on Michael Parkinson's BBC Radio 2 programme."]}, {"page": "Peter Clayton", "response": ["According to Alyn Shipton in 2012, \"Throughout the 70s and 80s, Peter [Clayton] became synonymous with jazz on BBC Radio.\" In addition to playing jazz records, Clayton organised and presented live jazz recordings with studio audiences, with sets lasting about 30 minutes recorded at BBC's Maida Vale Studios in London during the week.
