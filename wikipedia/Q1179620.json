He left United in 1974 after scoring 27 goals for the club to join Preston North End, who were being managed by Sadler's former teammate Bobby Charlton.\nHe made 121 appearances (including one as substitute) for the Deepdale club and scored four goals before retiring due to injury in 1977, by which time Charlton had resigned as manager.\nSadler was capped four times for England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FA Youth Cup", "response": ["| David Sadler"]}, {"page": "Football pools", "response": ["After the death of Banks in February 2019 and Hunt's retirement from the panel, they were replaced by Ian Callaghan and David Sadler, with Green continuing as a member of the three-man panel."]}, {"page": "Yalding", "response": ["*David Sadler, (b. 1946), football player, was born in Yalding."]}, {"page": "Bill Foulkes", "response": ["By winning the league title in 1966\u201367, United once again qualified for the European Cup for 1967\u201368.

On 16 October 1965, he became Manchester United's first ever substitute in a Football League match, coming on for Denis Law in a 5\u20131 away defeat against Tottenham Hotspur.Dykes (1994), p. 133. He made only sporadic appearances over the next two seasons, exclusively as a wing-half, where his opportunities were limited by the appearances of Stiles and Pat Crerand. The 1967\u201368 season saw him make more regular appearances in a variety of positions, including in the forward line, but it was not until February 1969 that he found his ultimate position as a right-sided full-back, filling in for the injured Shay Brennan. His season came to a slightly premature end, when he was sent off in the first leg of the European Cup semi-final against Milan, following which he had to have a police escort to the changing rooms.McCartney (2013), p. 157.

He spent the following season primarily with the reserve team to develop his skills. Chisnall was given the number 8 shirt at the start of the 1963\u201364 season, displacing Albert Quixall. He went on to form a strike partnership with Ian Moir and David Sadler, both of whom had also been recently promoted. His performance resulted in his being called up to the England under-23 team in November 1963. He made one appearance for the England squad, a 4\u20132 win over Germany at Anfield. Alf Ramsey said at the time that Chisnall was \"probably the best passer of a ball in the country\".

In the second leg, United suffered a \"sad succession of near misses\", according to a correspondent for The Guardian, as they struggled to adapt to the sandy pitch and the match finished as a goalless draw. They were drawn against Sarajevo of Yugoslavia in the second round, who were appearing in the competition for the first time.
