Bowen's musical career spanned more than fifty years during which time he wrote over 160 works.  As well as being a pianist and composer, Bowen was a talented conductor, organist, violist and horn player.  Despite achieving considerable success during his lifetime, many of the composer's works remained unpublished and unperformed until after his death in 1961.  Bowen's compositional style is widely considered as \u2018Romantic\u2019 and his works are often characterized by their rich harmonic language.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Viola", "response": ["The viola often plays the \"inner voices\" in string quartets and symphonic writing, and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts. The viola occasionally plays a major, soloistic role in orchestral music. Examples include the symphonic poem, Don Quixote, by Richard Strauss, and the symphony/concerto, Harold en Italie, by Hector Berlioz. In the earlier part of the 20th century, more composers began to write for the viola, encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as Lionel Tertis and William Primrose. English composers Arthur Bliss, York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, Frank Bridge, Benjamin Britten, Rebecca Clarke and Ralph Vaughan Williams all wrote substantial chamber and concert works. Many of these pieces were commissioned by, or written for Lionel Tertis. William Walton, Bohuslav Martin\u016f, T\u014dru Takemitsu, Tibor Serly, Alfred Schnittke, and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k have written well-known viola concertos. The concerti by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Paul Hindemith, Carl Stamitz, Georg Philipp Telemann, and William Walton are considered major works of the viola repertoire.
