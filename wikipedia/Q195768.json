She served as a Teachta D\u00e1la for the Dublin South constituency from 1921 to 1922 and 1923 to 1927. She was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Dublin St Patrick's from 1918 to 1922.\nA founding member of Fianna \u00c9ireann, Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army, she took part in the Easter Rising in 1916, when Irish republicans attempted to end British rule and establish an Irish Republic. She was sentenced to death, commuted to life imprisonment on the grounds of her sex. On 28 December 1918, she was the first woman elected to the UK House of Commons, though, being in Holloway Prison at the time and in accordance with party policy, she did not take her seat. Instead, she and the other Sinn F\u00e9in MPs (as TDs) formed the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. She was also one of the first women in the world to hold a cabinet position, as Minister for Labour, from 1919 to 1922.Markievicz supported  the anti-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War. She continued as (abstentionist) D\u00e1il member for Sinn F\u00e9in until 1926, when she became a founding member of Fianna F\u00e1il.

The president of the courts-martial was Charles Blackader. Controversially, Maxwell decided that the courts-martial would be held in secret and without a defence, which Crown law officers later ruled to have been illegal. Some of those who conducted the trials had commanded British troops involved in suppressing the Rising, a conflict of interest that the Military Manual prohibited. Only one of those tried by courts-martial was a woman, Constance Markievicz, who was also the only woman to be kept in solitary confinement. Ninety were sentenced to death. Fifteen of those (including all seven signatories of the Proclamation) had their sentences confirmed by Maxwell and fourteen were executed by firing squad at Kilmainham Gaol between 3 and 12 May. Among them was the seriously wounded Connolly, who was shot while tied to a chair because of his shattered ankle. Maxwell stated that only the \"ringleaders\" and those proven to have committed \"coldblooded murder\" would be executed. However, the evidence presented was weak, and some of those executed were not leaders and did not kill anyone: Willie Pearse described himself as \"a personal attach\u00e9 to my brother, Patrick Pearse\"; John MacBride had not even been aware of the Rising until it began, but had fought against the British in the Boer War fifteen years before; Thomas Kent did not come out at all\u2014he was executed for the killing of a police officer during the raid on his house the week after the Rising.
