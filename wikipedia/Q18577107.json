Dr. Thomas Somerville (1741\u20131830) (author of My Own Life and Times). Her childhood home was at Burntisland, Fife, where her mother was from. She was the second of four surviving children (three of her siblings had died in infancy). She was particularly close to her oldest brother Sam. The family lived in genteel poverty because her father's naval pay remained meagre as he rose through the ranks. Her mother supplemented the household's income by growing vegetables, maintaining an orchard and keeping cows for milk. Her mother taught her to read the Bible and Calvinist catechisms, and when not occupied with household chores Mary roamed among the birds and flowers in the garden. In her autobiography Somerville recollects that after returning from sea her father said to her mother \"This kind of life will never do, Mary must at least know how to write and keep accounts\". Thus the 10-year-old was sent for a year of tuition at an expensive boarding school in Musselburgh. Somerville learned the first principles of writing, rudimentary French and English grammar. Upon returning home, she:", "When Mary was 13 her mother sent her to writing school in Edinburgh during the winter months, where she improved her writing skills and studied the common rules of arithmetic. Back in Burntisland she taught herself sufficient Latin to read the books in the home library. While visiting her aunt in Jedburgh she met her uncle Dr. Thomas Somerville and picked up the courage to tell him that she had been trying to learn Latin. Dr. Somerville assured her that in ancient times many women had been very elegant scholars, and proceeded to teach her Latin by reading Virgil with her. While visiting another uncle, William Charters, in Edinburgh, Mary was sent to Strange's dancing school, where she learned manners and how to curtsey. She also accompanied her uncle and aunt on their visits to the Lyell family in Kinnordy; Charles Lyell would go on to become a celebrated geologist and a friend of Mary.", "From her second marriage she had three daughters and one son: Margaret Farquhar Somerville (1813\u20131823; died in childhood), Thomas Somerville (1814\u20131815; died in infancy), Martha Charters Somerville (1815\u20131879) and Mary Charlotte Somerville (1817-1875).
