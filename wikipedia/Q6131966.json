It was published in book form in 1839, before the serialised version was completed, and even outsold early editions of Oliver Twist.Buckley, p.426. Ainsworth's novel was adapted into a successful play by John Buckstone in October 1839 at the Adelphi Theatre starring Mary Anne Keeley. It has been described as the \"exemplary climax\" of \"the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially\".Buckley, p.438, quoting Meisel, p.265. (It seems likely that Cruikshank's illustrations were deliberately created in a form that would be easy to repeat as tableaux on stage.)

This scheme appears to have met with success. Trusler next established a printing and bookselling business upon an extensive and lucrative scale. At one time he resided in Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell, and also at Boyle Street. He afterwards lived at Bath on the profits of his trade, and subsequently on an estate of his own at Englefield Green, Middlesex. In 1806, he published at Bath the first part of his autobiography, entitled The Memoirs of the Life of the Revd. Dr. Trusler, 4to.
