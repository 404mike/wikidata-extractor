Paltrow's choice, which revealed her underwear through sheer black lace panels, led to her being named 4th worst-dressed celebrity of the year by Time. However, it received international attention with one French publication praising its combination of modernity, boldness and minimalism. Spanish language publications commented on how Paltrow successfully combined her \"Laura Ingalls\" sweetness with elements of \"punk\" edginess, in her on-trend corset-and-lingerie-inspired dress, with \u00a1Hola! using it as an illustration of the new fashion. The dress, which Paltrow described as \"one of the absolute favourite dresses I have worn,\" was subsequently selected by Lucy Yeomans of Harper's Bazaar UK to be the 2009 Dress of the Year in the permanent collection of the Fashion Museum, Bath."]}]}}
