He received a BSc from Warwick University in 1975, an MSc from Oxford in 1976, and a PhD from Caltech, all in mathematics. He joined Bell Labs in 1980, and retired from AT&T Labs in 2003 as Vice President for Research and Internet and network systems. He then went to Princeton as a professor of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Applied and Computational Mathematics, before moving to Duke in 2010 to become Dean of Natural Sciences.His contributions to coding and information theory won the IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award in 1995 and 1999.He was elected as a member into the US National Academy of Engineering in 2005 for leadership in communications research, from advances in algebraic coding theory to signal processing for wire-line and wireless modems. He also became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012.Calderbank won the 2013 IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal and the 2015 Claude E. Shannon Award. \nHe was named a SIAM Fellow in the 2021 class of fellows, \"for deep contributions to information theory\".He is married to Ingrid Daubechies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Warwick", "response": ["In academia, people associated with Warwick include: Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1975) winner Sir John Cornforth who was a Professor at Warwick; mathematicians Ian Stewart, David Preiss, David Epstein and Fields Medallist Martin Hairer; computer scientists Mike Cowlishaw and Leslie Valiant; and neurologist Oliver Sacks.

According to the quantum Hamming bound, encoding a single logical qubit and providing for arbitrary error correction in a single qubit requires a minimum of 5 physical qubits.", "* A more general class of codes (encompassing the former) are the stabilizer codes discovered by Daniel Gottesman (), and by Robert Calderbank, Eric Rains, Peter Shor, and N.

Proposed by Vahid Tarokh, Nambi Seshadri and Robert Calderbank, these space\u2013time codes (STCs) achieve significant error rate improvements over single-antenna systems. Their original scheme was based on trellis codes but the simpler block codes were utilised by Siavash Alamouti, and later Vahid Tarokh, Hamid Jafarkhani and Robert Calderbank to develop space\u2013time block-codes (STBCs). STC involves the transmission of multiple redundant copies of data to compensate for fading and thermal noise in the hope that some of them may arrive at the receiver in a better state than others. In the case of STBC in particular, the data stream to be transmitted is encoded in blocks, which are distributed among spaced antennas and across time. While it is necessary to have multiple transmit antennas, it is not necessary to have multiple receive antennas, although to do so improves performance. This process of receiving diverse copies of the data is known as diversity reception and is what was largely studied until Foschini's 1998 paper."]}, {"page": "Claude E.
