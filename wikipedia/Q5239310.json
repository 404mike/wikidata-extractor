It isn't precisely recorded when he left and joined Preston North End, but it was before 1886. He joined Preston in their pre\u2013League days and soon gained a reputation as a strong\u2013tackling defender. He was certainly not a player to cross, as he showed in the match against Blackburn Olympic in 1886: Russell chased an opponent down the pitch and kicked him in the back. He was the club's first\u2013choice centre\u2013half when the first Football League season got underway.Playing at centre\u2013half, made his League debut on 22 September 1888 at Deepdale in a match against Bolton Wanderers. The home team defeated the visitors 3\u20131. He appeared in 18 of the 22 League matches played by Preston North End in season 1888\u201389, and was a member of the defence that kept 12 clean\u2013sheets and restricted the opposition to one goal on three occasions. He also played in all the FA Cup ties, scoring in the semi\u2013final, and achieved a winner's medal in the Final which Preston won 3\u20130 over Wolverhampton Wanderers.Russell played in all but one of the games the following season as Preston retained their title, and then informed the management team that he no longer wished to play for the club. He moved on to Nottingham Forest, where he spent two seasons, then moved North to Ardwick for one season (1892\u201393), making 19 appearances (17 League), scoring three goals.Russell played for Notts County in season 1895\u201396 for one season, playing nine times.
