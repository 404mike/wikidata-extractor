Bennett published it a year later, but still the sheet music did poorly.Charters, The Country Blues, p. 40: \"Discouraged by the lack of sales, he sold the plates and right for fifty dollars and a thousand unsold copies for another fifty dollars. the Memphis music-store owner who bought it managed to talk the famous minstrel man 'Honey Boy' Evans into using the piece in his New York engagement the next spring and engage a professional lyricist, George A. Norton, to write some words for it. It was republished in New York in the spring of 1913 with a picture of Evan's band on the cover and a note saying that the piece had been featured by the Famous Handy Orchestra of Memphis.\" \"As a song, 'Memphis Blues' was more successful than it had been as the old instrumental piece, but it still was not a sensation.

Both 'Memphis Blues' and 'St. Louis Blues' begin with a brief introduction, then contrast a strain in the 12-bar-blues form with another in the more standard 16-bar shape. To put it another way, commercialized blues of the 1910s and early 20s tend to have a 12-bar chorus embedded in a larger, multistrain structure.\""]}, {"page": "Ren Shields", "response": ["Ren Shields was an American folk musician born in 1868 in Chicago, Illinois.
