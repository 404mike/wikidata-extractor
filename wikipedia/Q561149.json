He is best known for leading the 1984\u20131985 miners' strike, a major event in the history of the British labour movement.\nJoining the NUM at the age of nineteen in 1957, Scargill became one of its leading activists in the late 1960s. He led an unofficial strike in 1969, and played a key organising role during the strikes of 1972 and 1974, the latter of which played a part in the downfall of Edward Heath's Conservative government.\nA decade later, Scargill led the NUM through the 1984\u20131985 miners' strike. It turned into a fierce confrontation with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher in which the miners' union was defeated. A former Labour Party member, he is now the party leader of the Socialist Labour Party (SLP), which he founded in 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Euroscepticism", "response": ["Although often associated with being a cause on the right in the twenty-first century with the contemporary Labour Party supporting EU membership, there have been notable Eurosceptic politicians on the left of British politics, such as former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn who held a longstanding opposition to British membership of the EU throughout his career. Other Labour MPs who have supported eurosceptic sentiments and British withdrawal have included Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Graham Stringer, Ian Austin, Tom Harris, Gisela Stuart and Austin Mitchell. Other figures on the left have included George Galloway and socialist politician and trade unionist Arthur Scargill who both endorsed Britain's exit from the European Union."]}, {"page": "January 11", "response": ["*1938 \u2013 Arthur Scargill, English miner, activist, and politician"]}, {"page": "March 3", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 Arthur Scargill declares that the National Union of Mineworkers' national executive voted to end the longest-running industrial dispute in Great Britain without any peace deal over pit closures."]}, {"page": "Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["In March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) proposed to close 20 of the 174\u00a0state-owned mines and cut 20,000\u00a0jobs out of 187,000. Two-thirds of the country's miners, led by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill, downed tools in protest. However, Scargill refused to hold a ballot on the strike, having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983). This led to the strike being declared illegal by the High Court of Justice."]}, {"page": "Neil Kinnock", "response": ["Born and raised in South Wales, Kinnock was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1970 general election. He became the Labour Party\u2019s shadow education minister after the Conservatives won power in the 1979 general election. After the party under Michael Foot suffered a landslide defeat to Margaret Thatcher in the 1983 election, Kinnock was elected Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition. During his tenure as leader, Kinnock proceeded to fight the party's left wing, especially Militant tendency, and he opposed NUM leader Arthur Scargill's methods in the 1984\u201385 miners' strike. He led the party during most of the Thatcher administration, which included its third successive election defeat when Thatcher won the 1987 general election. Although Thatcher had won another landslide, Labour regained sufficient seats for Kinnock to remain Leader of the Opposition following the election.", "All this meant that Kinnock had made plenty of enemies on the left-wing of the party by the time he was elected as leader, though a substantial number of former Bennites gave him strong support. He was almost immediately in serious difficulty as a result of Arthur Scargill's decision to lead his union, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) into a national strike (in opposition to pit closures) without a nationwide ballot. The NUM was widely regarded as the labour movement's praetorian guard and the strike convulsed the Labour movement. Kinnock supported the aim of the strike \u2013 which he dubbed the \"case for coal\" \u2013 but, as an MP from a mining area, was bitterly critical of the tactics employed. When heckled at a Labour Party rally for referring to the killing of David Wilkie as \"an outrage\", Kinnock lost his temper and accused the hecklers of \"living like parasites off the struggle of the miners\" and implied that Scargill had lied to the striking miners. In 1985, he made his criticisms public in a speech to Labour's conference:"]}, {"page": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)", "response": ["Given the union's support from many western governments, relations with trade unions in capitalist countries could be complicated. For example, during the UK miners' strike of 1984\u201385, Wa\u0142\u0119sa said that \"The miners should fight, but with common sense\u2014not with destruction\" and said of Margaret Thatcher \"With such a wise and brave woman, Britain will find a solution to the strike.\" However, David Jastrz\u0119bski, the president of Upper Silesia Solidarity, voiced his support of the striking miners: \"Neither the British government's mounted police charges nor its truncheon blows, any more than the Polish junta's tanks or rifle fire, can break our common will to struggle for a better future for the working class.\" This was despite the fact that Arthur Scargill, president of the British National Union of Mineworkers had been highly critical of Solidarity, condemning it as an \"anti-socialist organization which desires the overthrow of a socialist state\"."]}, {"page": "1980s", "response": ["* Poor industrial relations marked the beginning of the decade; the UK miners' strike (1984\u201385) was a major industrial action affecting the UK coal industry. The strike by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was led by Arthur Scargill, although some NUM members considered it to be unconstitutional and did not observe it. The BBC has referred to the strike as \"the most bitter industrial dispute in British history.\" At its height, the strike involved 142,000 mineworkers, making it the biggest since the 1926 General Strike."]}, {"page": "1981", "response": ["** Arthur Scargill becomes President-elect of the National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)."]}, {"page": "Jennifer Saunders", "response": ["In 1985, Saunders starred in and co-wrote Girls on Top with French, Tracey Ullman, and Ruby Wax, which portrayed four eccentric women sharing a flat in London. Saunders also appeared in Ben Elton's Happy Families where she played various members of the same family, including all four Fuddle sisters in the six-episode BBC situation comedy. Saunders starred in a Comic Strip film called The Supergrass, a little-known parody of slick 1980s police dramas, directed by Peter Richardson. Saunders played Meryl Streep playing Arthur Scargill's wife in Strike, a Comic Strip spoof on the 1984 miners' strike.

However, some miners considered Benn's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a \"regional matter\" in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been. Benn also spoke at a Militant tendency rally held in 1984, saying: \"The labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers, nor do we seek to win public support by arguing that the crisis could be ended by the election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism. We are working for a majority labour government, elected on a socialist programme, as decided by conference.\""]}, {"page": "Walton, Wakefield", "response": ["Before closure, Walton Colliery had been saved several times by industrial action.

The title song was unusually aggressive in its language towards the strikebreakers. This collection was only released on cassette and remaining copies are rare, but some of the less aggressive songs have featured on other compilations.  At MacColl's 70th birthday party, he was presented by Arthur Scargill with a miner's lamp to show appreciation for his support."]}]}}
