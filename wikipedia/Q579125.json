He had spent the pre-season ahead of the 2012\u201313 season training with the club, although the transfer had been held up while the club waited for confirmation from the Football League in accordance with new financial fair play rules. Beardsley made his Preston debut in a 2\u20130 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 14 August 2012, assisting the club's second goal of the match, with his low cross being scored by Nicky Wroe. He scored his first goal for Preston on 4 September 2012 after converting David Amoo's cross in the third-minute of their 1\u20131 away draw with Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, a tie that Preston won 3\u20131 on penalties. Beardsley scored one further goal that month, heading in Jeffrey Monakana's cross on 64 minutes as Preston came from behind to beat Yeovil Town 3\u20132 at home. It proved to be Beardsley's last goal for five months, ending his goal drought in a 3\u20131 away loss to Yeovil on 12 February 2013, in what was Westley's last match in charge of the club. Beardsley made just two appearances under new manager Simon Grayson over the remainder of the season, both as a second-half substitute. Shortly after the season ended, he was told he could leave Preston if a suitable offer was received. He made 22 appearances during the 2012\u201313 season, scoring 3 times, as Preston ranked in 14th place in League One."]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.

On 3 November 2008, Huth played a full 90 minutes of a 2\u20131 home loss against Manchester City in the Premier Reserve League. The result was Liverpool's fourth consecutive loss, which despite not posing any attacking threat they went close when Huth himself played through his team-mate Jordy Brouwer whose shot eventually went straight at the goal keeper. Liverpool concluded the 2008\u201309 Premier Reserve League season in seventh position of the Premier Reserve League North with a total of 22 points. The reserve-team again attracted the highest attendance for the season with a total of 3,955 spectators in a fixture against Manchester United on 12 March 2009. Huth had made 8 league appearances for Liverpool in the Premier Reserve League and had also made 2 appearances in the 2007\u201308 Liverpool Senior Cup.
