Parsons captained the SCB in all five matches, and was also the team's highest aggregate run-scorer, accumulating 125 runs for the team, while Dimond took more wickets for the SCB than any other player, claiming six during his matches for the team. Arul Suppiah, who only played for the team once, scored 70 runs in an innings against Cornwall in 2002, the team's highest score. Another player who only appeared once for the side, Matthew Bulbeck, has the best bowling figures for the team, after taking five wickets against Norfolk in 2001. That performance also gives him the best bowling average amongst SCB players, with 3.60. In all, 31 players have appeared for the SCB, of which ten have also made first-class cricket appearances."]}]}}
