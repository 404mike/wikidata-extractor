Gawain appears as a supporting character in films such as Knights of the Round Table (1953, played by Robert Urquhart) and Excalibur (1981, played by Liam Neeson), all of which draw on elements of his traditional characterizations.Blanch & Wasserman, p. 185. Other films give Gawain a larger role. In the 1954 adaptation of Prince Valiant, he is a somewhat boorish, though noble and good-natured, foil for his squire and friend, Valiant.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 187\u201388. He plays his traditional part in the 1963 film Sword of Lancelot (played by George Baker), seeking revenge when Lancelot kills his unarmed brother Gareth, but ultimately coming to Lancelot's aid when he uncovers Mordred's responsibility.Williams, p. 386. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight has been adapted to film several times, including 1973's Gawain and the Green Knight (played by Murray Head) and 1984's Sword of the Valiant (played by Miles O'Keeffe), both directed by Stephen Weeks; neither film was well reviewed and both deviate substantially from the source material.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 190\u201391 A 1991 television adaptation by Thames Television, Gawain and the Green Knight, was both more faithful and better received.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 191\u201393. Other film portrayals included Robert Gwyn Davin's in First Knight (1995), Anthony Hickox in Prince Valiant (1997), Sebastian Roch\u00e9 in Merlin (1998), Noah Huntley in The Mists of Avalon (2001), and Joel Edgerton in King Arthur (2004). In the 2008 television series Merlin, Gawain appears as Sir Gwaine, played by Eoin Macken. Though of noble origin, he passes himself as a peasant due to his mother's mistreatment by the king his father served; he is finally knighted by Arthur due to his personal value. In the 2011 series Camelot, he is played by Clive Standen. In 2020's Cursed, Gawain played by Matt Stokoe doubles as the Green Knight. In the 2021 film The Green Knight, Gawain is portrayed by Dev Patel."]}, {"page": "1989 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 13 January \u2013 Matt Stokoe, English actor"]}, {"page": "Tokuyoshi Kawashima", "response": ["* Devil's Pass \u2013 Jensen Day (Matt Stokoe)"]}, {"page": "William Brent Bell", "response": ["Bell is currently in post production on Lord of Misrule, an upcoming the folk horror film starring Tuppence Middleton, Ralph Ineson, and Matt Stokoe."]}, {"page": "Stokoe", "response": ["* Matt Stokoe (born 1989), English actor"]}, {"page": "Misfits (TV series)", "response": ["Antonia Thomas, Iwan Rheon, Lauren Socha, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, and Robert Sheehan are introduced as Alisha Daniels, Simon Bellamy, Kelly Bailey, Curtis Donovan, and Nathan Young respectively.
