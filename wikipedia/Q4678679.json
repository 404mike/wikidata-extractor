Adamson only made one appearance for The Bulls and this was on 27 February 2010 in the League Two game against Notts County, where he started the game ahead of Bartlett. This game however would not be a successful game for Adamson as after conceding two goals from Craig Westcarr, he then brought down Westcarr in the penalty box and he was subsequently sent off in the 71st minute of the game. Bartlett, who was the substitute keeper, came on for Leon Constantine conceded the subsequent penalty and two further goals, both scored by Luke Rodgers.

His first appearance of 2010\u201311 came in the opening match, a 1\u20130 home defeat to Hereford on 7 August 2010, in which he missed an early opportunity to score, shooting wide of the goal having been one-on-one with goalkeeper Adam Bartlett. His first goals of the season came after scoring twice in a 7\u20130 home victory over Barnet on 21 August 2010, the first a shot into the bottom left of the goal and the second a close-range header.

Novak won the golden boot award and was bought by League One side Huddersfield Town for a fee that has brought Gateshead a North East non-league record fee of \u00a3150,000. His team retained their Conference National status in 2009\u201310, finishing above the relegation zone on goal difference (though this was later made into a two-point gap after Salisbury City were expelled from the division). On 28 April 2010, Bogie signed a new two-year contract which made him Gateshead's first full-time manager in over half a century. Under his charge the \"Tynesiders\" posted a 14th-place finish in 2010\u201311, reaching the semi-final of the FA Trophy and winning the Durham Challenge Cup. Gateshead pushed on again in 2011\u201312, flirting around the play-off spots all season before finishing in eighth position; they also reached the FA Cup second round and the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy. He signed a one-year extension to his contract in May 2012. He then lost top-scorer Jon Shaw to Luton Town, and attempted to replace him with former Hartlepool United stalwart James Brown. He further signed defender Glenn Wilson, goalkeeper Adam Bartlett, attacker Ryan Donaldson, and defender Chris Bush. However, after opening the 2012\u201313 season with six leagues without defeat, Gateshead struggled with poor form. On 10 December 2012, Bogie and assistant Terry Mitchell were relieved of their duties at the club."]}, {"page": "Trevor Carson", "response": ["He was initially expected to be the club's first choice goalkeeper ahead of new signing, Adam Bartlett but suffered a toe injury while training and was sidelined for months. By October, Carson made a return to the substitute bench for a match against Luton Town. It wasn't until on 17 October 2015 when he made his Hartlepool United debut, starting the whole game and kept a clean sheet, in a 1\u20130 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. Since making his debut for the club, Carson quickly became a first choice goalkeeper, dispatching a place from Bartlett. His performances earned him praise from Manager Ronnie Moore. He then helped Hartlepool United keep four consecutive clean sheets between 15 March 2016 and 28 March 2016. On 16 April 2016, Carson signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2019. He later helped Hartlepool United finish sixteenth place in the league. Despite being sidelined at the start of the season, Carson was awarded Hartlepool United's Player of the Year and Hartlepool Mail Player of the Year. He was also awarded The Northern Echo's North-East Team of the Season. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, Carson went on to make thirty\u2013eight appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "2009 Conference Premier play-off Final", "response": ["|GK ||20||Adam Bartlett"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| 1 ||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Adam Bartlett", "|  Adam Bartlett"]}, {"page": "David Cornell", "response": ["After Swansea's promotion to the Premier League, Cornell's opportunities were further limited.
