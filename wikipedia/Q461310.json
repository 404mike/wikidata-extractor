Her numerous contributions to literature have classified her as one of the non-canonical minor novelist of the Victorian period (1837\u20131901). Although she is mainly known for the novel and tales she wrote, she also published important non-fiction works that explored the theme of female political, moral and philosophical contributions to society. The appeal of her works is represented by the fact that several of her works have been translated into French, German, Italian and Swedish. Her texts also reached North America, where some of her works appeared in Littel's Living Age, an American magazine. Moreover, she was known to celebrated writers of domestic fiction such as Charles Dickens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1877", "response": ["* October 28 \u2013 Julia Kavanagh, Irish novelist (b. 1824)"]}, {"page": "1824", "response": ["* January 7 \u2013 Julia Kavanagh, Irish novelist (d. 1877)"]}, {"page": "Aphra Behn", "response": ["After her death in 1689, Behn's literary work was marginalised and often dismissed outright, notwithstanding the 1700 publication of her Histories, Novels, and Translations which preserved her literary production for future re-discovery.Cox, Michael, ed.

In the 19th century Mary Hays, Matilda Betham, Alexander Dyce, Jane Williams and Julia Kavanagh decided that Behn's writings were unfit to read, because they were corrupt and deplorable.

Julia was, by that time, a successful author in her own right. In a series of letters, between her and Newby, published in the periodical Athenaeum, Julia denied any such involvement and threatened legal action. Newby ultimately printed a new cover page which omitted the reference to Julia.
