Hodes completed a Foundation course at Brighton College of Art (1977\u20131978), studied Fine Art as an undergraduate student (1978\u20131982) and Painting as a postgraduate student (1982\u20131984) at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, University of London. At the Slade School under the Professorship of Lawrence Gowing, she was a student of Paula Rego, Stanley Jones and John Hoyland.\nHodes\u2019 practice is informed by her experience as a painter and is investigated through large scale papercuts which have been both digitally collaged and intricately hand cut, as well as ornately decorated ceramic vessels, tableware and glass. Her iconography is centred on the female figure within a contemporary context depicted as a silhouette juxtaposed with motifs loaded with female associated references such as the vessel and skirt. Her work questions hierarchies of the female figure as represented in art history, as a decorative motif and as being inextricably linked to the domestic. She draws upon the decorative and applied arts, fashion and costume, often using archives and collections as a source for projects.\nHodes is the only contemporary artist to have been invited to work as an artist at the celebrated ceramic factory Spode (1998\u20132003). In 2005 she was appointed the first Associate Artist at The Wallace Collection culminating in her solo exhibition \u2018 Fragmented Images\u2019 at the museum in 2007.
