B. Yeats and Arthur Symons described Nietzsche as the intellectual heir to William Blake. Symons went on to compare the ideas of the two thinkers in The Symbolist Movement in Literature, while Yeats tried to raise awareness of Nietzsche in Ireland. A similar notion was espoused by W. H. Auden who wrote of Nietzsche in his New Year Letter (released in 1941 in The Double Man): \"O masterly debunker of our liberal fallacies ... all your life you stormed, like your English forerunner Blake.\" Nietzsche made an impact on composers during the 1890s. Writer Donald Mitchell noted that Gustav Mahler was \"attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of its writings\". He also quoted Mahler himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche's conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in his Third Symphony using Zarathustra's roundelay. Frederick Delius produced a piece of choral music, A Mass of Life, based on a text of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, while Richard Strauss (who also based his Also sprach Zarathustra on the same book), was only interested in finishing \"another chapter of symphonic autobiography\". Famous writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include Andr\u00e9 Gide, August Strindberg, Robinson Jeffers, P\u00edo Baroja, D.H.

Though his new job took up most of his time, he revised the Dubliners and worked on Stephen Hero. Rome was the birthplace of the idea for \"The Dead\", which would become the final story of Dubliners, and for Ulysses, which was originally conceived as a short story. His stay in the city was one his inspirations for Exiles. While there, he read the socialist historian Guglielmo Ferrero in depth. Ferraro's anti-heroic interpretations of history, arguments against militarism, and conflicted attitudes toward Jews would find their way into Ulysses, particularly in the character of Leopold Bloom. In London, Elkin Mathews published Chamber Music on the recommendation of the British poet Arthur Symons. Nonetheless, Joyce was dissatisfied with his job, had exhausted his finances, and realised he'd need additional support when he learned Nora was pregnant again. He left Rome after only seven months."]}, {"page": "T. S.

Because of his year at Milton Academy, Eliot was allowed to earn his Bachelor of Arts after three years instead of the usual four. Frank Kermode writes that the most important moment of Eliot's undergraduate career was in 1908 when he discovered Arthur Symons's The Symbolist Movement in Literature. This introduced him to Jules Laforgue, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul Verlaine. Without Verlaine, Eliot wrote, he might never have heard of Tristan Corbi\u00e8re and his book Les amours jaunes, a work that affected the course of Eliot's life.
