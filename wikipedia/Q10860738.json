The exact nature of his \"dissipations\" is not clear, but in 1994 Theo Aronson favoured the theory on \"admittedly circumstantial\" evidence that the \"unspecified 'dissipations' were predominantly homosexual\". Aronson's judgement was based on Albert Victor's \"adoration of his elegant and possessive mother; his 'want of manliness'; his 'shrinking from horseplay'; [and] his 'sweet, gentle, quiet and charming' nature\", as well as the Cleveland Street rumours and his opinion that there is \"a certain amount of homosexuality in all men\".Aronson, p. 119.

Its chief fault is the lack of harmony between Humbert's original building and Edis's extensions, \"a contrast between the northern and southern halves of the house (that) has been much criticised ever since\". The architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote in 1982, \"Sandringham, the latest in date of the houses of the British monarchy, is the least distinguished architecturally\". In his biography of Queen Mary, James Pope-Hennessy compared the house unfavourably to \"a golf-hotel at St Andrews or a station-hotel at Strathpeffer\". Simon Jenkins considered Sandringham \"unattractive\", with a \"grim, institutional appearance\". Pevsner described the architectural style as \"frenetic\"; Girouard expressed himself perplexed as to the preference shown by the royal family for A. J. Humbert, a patronage the writer Adrian Tinniswood described as \"the Victorian Royal Family's knack for choosing second-rate architects\". An article on the house in the June 1902 edition of Country Life opined, \"of mere splendour there is not much, but of substantial comfort a good deal\". The writer Clive Aslet suggests that the sporting opportunities offered by the estate were the main attraction for its royal owners, rather than \"the house itself, which even after rebuilding was never beguiling\".", "York Cottage, originally known as Bachelors' Cottage, was built by Edward, Prince of Wales, soon after he acquired Sandringham to provide further accommodation for guests. It was home to George V from 1893 until his mother's death enabled him to move into the main house in 1925. Edward VIII, by then Duke of Windsor, told his father's biographer Harold Nicolson, \"Until you have seen York Cottage you will never understand my father\". The cottage was no more highly regarded architecturally than the main house; James Pope-Hennessy, the official biographer of Queen Mary, called it, \"tremendously vulgar and emphatically, almost defiantly hideous\". Nicolson described it as a \"glum little villa (with) rooms indistinguishable from those of any Surbiton or Upper Norwood home\". He was particularly dismissive of the royal bathing arrangements: \"Oh my God! what a place. The King's and Queen's baths had lids that shut down so that when not in use they could be used as tables\". \"It is almost incredible that the heir to so vast a heritage lived in this horrible little house.\" Nicolson's strictures did not appear in his official biography of the King. York Cottage is currently the estate office for the Sandringham Estate."]}, {"page": "Banagher", "response": ["The travel writer and biographer, James Pope-Hennessy, described the River Shannon at Banagher in September in his biography of Anthony Trollope: \"The month of September in Banagher, and all along the Shannon banks, is visually a glorious one, with golden autumn mornings, the low sun making long shadows of the houses in the street. At dusk the whole river reflects the varied sunsets as the days draw in \u2013 effects of palest pink, for instance, striped by cloudy lines of green, or an horizon aflame with scarlet and orange light.\"", "Cuba Court, also known as Cuba House, was a house dating from the 1730s and may have been constructed by one George Frazer, a former Governor of Cuba and perhaps to a design of Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, who designed the Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin. It is certainly known to have been constructed with money from the sugar plantations in Cuba.Ireland of the Welcomes, Vol. 28 no.6, November \u2013 December 1979. In his biography of Anthony Trollope, James Pope-Hennessy describes Cuba Court as \"a fine example of an Irish country-house of the mid-eighteenth century in the manner of the Dublin architect, Pierce (sic). The building contained...two circular rooms...and an avenue of lime trees led to the front door.\"Pope-Hennessy, p. 74.

In the novel, Samuel Prong, like Obadiah Slope of Barchester Towers, has an ill-favored appearance, pursues marriage for money rather than love, and is \"not a gentleman\". Mrs. Prime is morose and motivated by a love of power; her Dorcas Society lieutenant, Miss Pucker, is a sour gossip-mongering spinster with a disfiguring squint. Rachel's happiness is threatened by the machinations of the Evangelical characters, and the intervention of two of her non-Evangelical neighbours is critical in salvaging it."]}, {"page": "The Vicar of Bullhampton", "response": ["Later critics varied in their opinion of the novel.
