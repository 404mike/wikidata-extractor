Co-produced by Ken Scott, Bowie recorded it with his backing band the Spiders from Mars \u2212 comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. According to Bowie, it was \"a smorgasbord of imagined Americana\", with a protagonist inspired by Iggy Pop, and the title being an allusion to author Jean Genet. One of Bowie's most famous tracks, it was promoted with a film clip featuring Andy Warhol associate Cyrinda Foxe and peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart.", "According to author Nicholas Pegg, \"The Jean Genie\" originated as an impromptu jam, at this point titled \"Bussin'\", on the tour bus between the first two concerts in Cleveland and Memphis, when Mick Ronson began playing the Bo Diddley-inspired guitar riff on his new Les Paul. It subsequently became the first song Bowie composed for Aladdin Sane, in autumn 1972 during his 1972 US tour, completing the song in New York City, where he spent time with the Warhol set's Cyrinda Foxe. Bowie later asserted, \"I wrote it for her amusement in her apartment. Sexy girl.\" Bowie later in the 1990s described the song as \"a smorgasbord of imagined America\" and \"my first New York song.\" ", "Bowie also recorded \"The Jean Genie\" for BBC's Top of the Pops, the performance being broadcast on 4 January 1973. Unusually for the era, the four-piece band performed live, and included an extended guitar solo by Mick Ronson. Tapes of this edition of Top of the Pops were subsequently wiped, but a copy was made by BBC cameraman John Henshall, who had utilised the then new fisheye lens camera techniques for the performance. Henshall was contacted to share his historic material, and was surprised to find he was the only one with a surviving copy. The film has since been preserved and was shown at the British Film Institute in December 2011. The BBC re-broadcast the clip in its Top of the Pops 2 Christmas Special on 21 December 2011, for the first time since the original broadcast in January 1973.", "* Mick Ronson \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Hunky Dory", "response": ["Hunky Dory is the fourth studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 17 December 1971 by RCA Records. Following the release of his 1970 album, The Man Who Sold the World, Bowie took time off from recording and touring. He settled down to write new songs, composing on piano rather than guitar as on earlier tracks. Following a tour of the United States, Bowie assembled a new backing band consisting of guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey, and began to record a new album in mid-1971 at Trident Studios in London.

His contract with music publisher Essex had expired and his new manager Tony Defries was facing prior contractual challenges. Bowie was also without a backing band, as the musicians on The Man Who Sold the World \u2013 including its producer and bassist Tony Visconti, guitarist Mick Ronson and drummer Mick Woodmansey \u2013 departed in August 1970 due to personal conflicts with the artist. After hearing a demo of Bowie's \"Holy Holy\", recorded in autumn 1970, Defries signed the singer to a contract with Chrysalis, but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects. Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace, who loved the demo of \"Holy Holy\" and subsequently booked time at Radio Luxembourg's studios in London for Bowie to record his demos. \"Holy Holy\", recorded in November 1970 and released as a single in January 1971, was a commercial flop.", "*Mick Ronson\u00a0\u2013 guitar, vocals, Mellotron, arrangements"]}, {"page": "Pure Prairie League", "response": ["At that point, Pure Prairie League owed RCA another album and Craig Fuller agreed to record the second record in RCA's Toronto studio with the help of George Ed Powell and Bob Ringe (who had also produced the first album).

Billy Hinds from Cincinnati (drums, percussion) joined the band and Hinds's friend, Michael Connor, played piano on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League line-up for years to come.

A contemporary review of the album by the BBC called the album \"a proper album, with a beginning, a middle and an end.

It's also rather lively and convincing.\" The same review called this and his earlier album Earthling Bowie's \"best album since Scary Monsters.\" Eric Carr of Pitchfork gave the album a positive review, writing: \"What last year's Heathen implied, and what Reality seems to prove, is that...Bowie has finally joined us all in the present, mind-young as ever but old enough not to make a show of it.\" He further complimented its relaxed nature and considered its original songs as far superior to its covers; he criticised his cover of \"Try Some, Buy Some\" and felt \"Pablo Picasso\" was an improvement, but overall subpar compared to the originals. He ultimately called the album \"pretty good\" and believed it cemented his status as a modern artist. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian similarly praised the album, calling it \"touching, intelligent\" and that it \"gels unexpectedly well\". She complimented Bowie's vocal performance and wrote that on the concept of 'reality', \"the lyrics leave you guessing.\" Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone praised the covers and felt the guitar work on \"New Killer Star\" was reminiscent of Mick Ronson's work on Lou Reed's 1972 album Transformer.
