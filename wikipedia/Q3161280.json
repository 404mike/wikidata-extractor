Six years later (268 BC) they further sought to secure its possession by establishing there a Roman colony with Latin rights.Livy Epit. xv.; Velleius Paterculus i. 14. It was at this time that it first assumed the name of Beneventum, having previously been called Maleventum, a name which the Romans regarded as of evil augury, and changed into one of a more fortunate signification.Pliny iii. 11. s. 16; Liv. ix. 27; Fest. s. v. Beneventum, p. 34; Steph. B. s. v.; Procop. B. G. i. 15. It is probable that the Oscan or Samnite name was Maloeis, or Malieis (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 in Ancient Greek), whence the form Maleventum would derive, like Agrigentum from Acragas (now Agrigento), Selinuntium from Selinus (the ruins of which are at now Selinunte), etc.James Millingen, Numnismatique de l'Italie, p. 223."]}, {"page": "Isernia", "response": ["The coins of Aesernia, which are found only in copper, and have the legend \"AISERNINO\", belong to the period of the first Roman colony; the style of their execution attests the influence of the neighboring Campania.James Millingen, Numismatique de l'Italie, p. 218."]}, {"page": "Metapontum", "response": ["Though  Metapontum is mentioned less than of Sybaris, Crotona, and Tarentum, yet all accounts agree in representing it as, in the days of its prosperity, one of the most opulent and flourishing of the cities of Magna Graecia. The fertility of its territory, especially in the growth of corn, vied with the neighbouring district of the Siritis. It is known that the Metapontines sent to the temple at Delphi an offering of a golden harvest,, Strabo vi. p. 264. perhaps referring to a sheaf or bundle of corn wrought in gold. For the same reason an ear of corn became the characteristic symbol on their coins, the number and variety of which in itself sufficiently attests the wealth of the city.James Millingen, Numismatique de l'Italie, p. 22.  They had a treasury of their own at Olympia still existing in the days of Pausanias.Pausanias vi. 19. \u00a7 11; Athen. xi. p. 479. Herodotus tells  that they paid particular honors to Aristeas, who was said to have appeared in their city 340\u00a0years after he had disappeared from Cyzicus. They erected to him a statue in the middle of the forum, with an altar to Apollo surrounded by a grove of laurels.Herod. iv. 15 ; Athen. xiii. p.\u00a0605, c. From their coins they would appear also to have paid heroic honours to Leucippus, as the founder of their city.Millingen, l. c. p. 24. Strabo tells, as a proof of their Pylian origin, that they continued to perform sacrifices to the Neleidae.Strabo vi. p. 264."]}, {"page": "Frentani", "response": ["There exist copper coins with the Oscan legend \"Frentrei\", which may probably be referred to the Frentani rather than to the town of Ferentum in Apulia, to which they have been assigned by some writers. Others are of opinion that they indicate the existence of a city of the name of Frentrum as the capital of the Frentani, which is supposed to be the one referred to by LivyLivy, ix. 16. where he says \"Frentanos vicit urbemque ipsam - in deditionem accepit\", without naming the city.Julius Friedl\u00e4nder, Oskische M\u00fcnzen, p. 42; James Millingen, Numismatique de l'Italie, p. 180."]}, {"page": "Atri, Abruzzo", "response": ["It is now generally admitted that the coins of Adria (with the legend \"HAT.\") belong to the city of Picenum, not that of the Veneto; but great difference of opinion has been entertained as to their age. They belong to the class commonly known as aes grave, and are even among the heaviest specimens known, exceeding in weight the most ancient Roman . On this account they have been assigned to a very remote antiquity, some referring them to the Etruscan, others to the Greek, settlers. But there seems much reason to believe that they are not really so ancient, and belong, in fact, to the Roman colony, which was founded previous to the general reduction of the Italian brass coinage. cites Eckhel, vol. i. p. 98; M\u00fcller, Etrusker, vol. i. p. 308; B\u00f6ckh, Metrologie, p. 379; Mommsen, Das R\u00f6mische M\u00fcnzwesen, p. 231; James Millingen, Numismatique de l'Italie, p. 216."]}, {"page": "Heraclea Lucania", "response": ["Heraclea is generally regarded as the native country of the celebrated painter Zeuxis, though there is much doubt to which of the numerous cities of the name that distinguished artist really owed his birth. But the flourishing state of the arts in the Lucanian Heraclea (in common with most of the neighbouring cities of Magna Graecia) is attested by the beauty and variety of its coins, some of which may deservedly be reckoned among the choicest specimens of Greek art; while their number sufficiently proves the opulence and commercial activity of the city to which they belong.Eckhel, p. 153; James Millingen, p. 111."]}, {"page": "Neapolis (Apulia)", "response": ["Neapolis (Greek: ) meaning \"New City\", was an ancient city of Apulia, Italy, not mentioned by any ancient writer, but the existence of which is attested by its coins.

It has been said that if Byron had lived and had gone on to defeat the Ottomans, he might have been declared King of Greece. However, modern scholars have found such an outcome unlikely. The British historian David Brewer wrote that in one sense, Byron was a failure in Greece as he failed to persuade the rival Greek factions to unite, won no victories and was successful only in the humanitarian sphere, using his great wealth to help the victims of the war, Muslim and Christian, but this did not affect the outcome of the Greek war of independence at all."]}, {"page": "John G.

Mer. 5. When the Athenians passed into the age of manhood, they again let their hair grow. In ancient times at Athens the hair was rolled up into a kind of knot on the crown of the head, and fastened with golden clasps in the shape of grasshoppers. This fashion of wearing the hair, which was called krobylos, had gone out just before the time of Thucydides.Thucydides i. 6. The Athenian females also wore their hair in the same fashion, which was in their case called korymbos.See James Millingen (Peintures Antiques, plate 40).
