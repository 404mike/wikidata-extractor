Keeton scored a century against every other first-class county and his 312 not out made in just under eight hours against Middlesex at the Oval in 1939 is still a record for the Nottinghamshire team.\nHe also played professional association football for Nottingham Forest and Sunderland, for the latter as an inside forward.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Walter Keeton"]}, {"page": "1939 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Learie Constantine, Bill Edrich, Walter Keeton, Brian Sellers, Doug Wright"]}, {"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Between the wars Notts enjoyed the services of the famous bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce.

They lost Bill Voce early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946.Playfair, pp. 102\u2013103.
