He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1940 and played first-class cricket as a right-handed opening batsman between 1926 and 1952 for Nottinghamshire. Keeton scored a century against every other first-class county and his 312 not out made in just under eight hours against Middlesex at the Oval in 1939 is still a record for the Nottinghamshire team.\nHe also played professional association football for Nottingham Forest and Sunderland, for the latter as an inside forward.", "link_mentions": {}}}
