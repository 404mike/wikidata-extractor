In the weeks before the battle, the Spanish garrison made a valiant and successful defense; but it surrendered the day after the battle. Historian Charles Oman stated that the site was converted into a fortress in 1810\u20131811 by General Joaqu\u00edn Blake at the suggestion of British officer Charles William Doyle. At that time, much of the largely intact Roman theater was dismantled to provide stone for restoring the old walls."]}, {"page": "Charles Doyle", "response": ["* Charles William Doyle (1770\u20131842), British Army officer"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Lieutenant-General Sir Charles William Doyle"]}, {"page": "John North (MP)", "response": ["Born John Doyle, he was the son of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles William Doyle."]}, {"page": "Battle of Saguntum", "response": ["As it happened, Blake resigned himself to a passive defense from the beginning. Instead he urged his soldiers to construct a fortified and entrenched line covering Valencia. About twenty miles to the north of Valencia at Sagunto, Blake ordered a powerful fortress to be built. In March 1810, the abandoned site contained only the hilltop ruins of the Roman city of Saguntum which was later occupied by the Moors. On the recommendation of the British officer Charles William Doyle, Spanish workers restored the old walls by filling the gaps with stone blocks from the ancient ruins. The Roman theater, relatively intact up to this time, was dismantled to provide building materials. However, the work was still unfinished when Suchet's army advanced. The fortress was manned by 2,663 soldiers under the command of Colonel Andriani. There were five battalions, including two newly-raised 3rd Battalions. The garrison had 17 cannons of which only three were 12-pounders and the rest lighter pieces. The Spanish also garrisoned Peniscola with 1,000 soldiers and Oropesa del Mar with 500 more."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Major-General Sir Charles William Doyle"]}]}}
