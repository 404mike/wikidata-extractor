In the event even Sam Watson, leader of Bevan's own miners' union, supported Gaitskell. Gaitskell won by 4.3 million votes to 2 million. Bevan gave a speech to the Tribune party at the conference, declaring that the Labour Leader needed to be a \"desiccated calculating machine\". He was widely and probably wrongly thought to be referring to Gaitskell, to whom the label stuck. In fact it may well have been aimed at Attlee who had the previous day warned against \"emotionalism\" whilst privately Bevan thought that Gaitskell was highly emotional and, as he had shown in 1951, \"couldn\u2019t count\".Campbell 2010, p222-3"]}, {"page": "Iain Macleod", "response": ["Macmillan had picked a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions.

Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike.Shepherd 1994, pp. 138\u201339 Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of \"Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower \u2013 Groucho, not Karl\" \"Sir, I never forget a face, but I will make an exception for yours\". He then moved on to a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that \"I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.\" He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as \"high order jugular debating\", accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal."]}, {"page": "Transport and General Workers' Union", "response": [":1945: Arthur Deakin (acting from 1940)", ":1935: Arthur Deakin"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*Arthur Deakin (1890\u20131955)"]}, {"page": "Jock Tiffin", "response": ["In 1955, while elections were underway for his successor, general secretary Arthur Deakin died suddenly and Tiffin took over as acting general secretary.
