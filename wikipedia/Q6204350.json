A former editor of the science journal Nature and opinion editor at New Scientist magazine in London, she has written for The Guardian and The Economist.Marchant writes that \"the idea for Decoding the Heavens came about in November 2006, when I was an editor at the science journal Nature. A research paper was due to be published revealing the workings of a sophisticated ancient device called the Antikythera mechanism. The story grabbed me immediately, and I was desperate to find out more about this mysterious contraption. I travelled to Athens to see the remains of the mechanism, and to meet those who have studied it and hear their stories.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Smithsonian (magazine)", "response": ["* Jo Marchant"]}, {"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["* Cure: A Journey Into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant (Canongate)", "*Decoding the Heavens by Jo Marchant"]}, {"page": "Decoding the Heavens", "response": ["Decoding the Heavens: A 2,000-Year-old Computer and the Century Long Search to Discover Its Secrets by Jo Marchant is an exploration of the history and significance of the Antikythera Mechanism ( ), an ancient mechanical calculator (also described as the first known mechanical computer\"The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project \", The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project.
