After it scored highly in the ratings, work began on the development of the series proper. Ian Kennedy Martin saw the subsequent series as being mainly studio-based, with more dialogue and less action, but producer Ted Childs, inspired in part by Get Carter (1971) and The French Connection (1971), disagreed. Following this battle for creative control, Ian Kennedy Martin parted company with the project. His shoes as series writer were filled by his brother Troy Kennedy Martin, Roger Marshall, Ranald Graham and Trevor Preston.

Smethurst, who had been brought in by Central Television's new head of drama, Ted Childs, ordered changes, aimed at creating a wittier, more upmarket serial, and at improving the production values of the show. Smethurst shifted the narrative centre to the nearby village of King's Oak. Yet more long-running characters, such as Diane Hunter and Benny Hawkins, were dropped; as with earlier changes, this was unpopular with viewers, who telephoned Central in protest. Smethurst gained the nickname \"Butcher Bill\" but was unfazed; he had, after all, reversed the declining fortunes of the BBC radio soap The Archers. Smethurst insisted he only got the flak because his was the name the public knew.Interview with William Smethurst "]}, {"page": "Noele Gordon", "response": ["In 1985, Matheson's successor Ted Childs ordered Crossroads to be revamped; one element in the updating of the show was its renaming as Crossroads Motel. The programme's new look was designed to bring back Gordon on an 'as and when' basis, starting with a three-month stint from April 1985. Gordon's return as Meg was devised by the new producer, Phillip Bowman, who himself ended the involvement with the series of regulars Ronald Allen and Sue Lloyd.

(1977) and Sweeney 2 (1978). Childs saw Quatermass as a big gamble for Euston, out of step with the company's usual fare. Childs later remarked that Verity Lambert \"didn't want to come in and just do the same old routine \u2013 the kick bollock and scramble action adventure stuff that made the early name of the company\".Alvarado & Stewart, Made for Television, p. 86.

The central idea was too ordinary\". Although Kneale was pleased with the high production values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills \"didn't have the authority for Quatermass\".Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 139. He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that \"We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that\". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that \"the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that\".Alvarado & Stewart, Made for Television, p. 87.

It was turned down by ITV because it was \"old-fashioned\" and did not fit in with the network's existing portfolio of dramas. Despite this, Childs and Carlton continued to develop the series and they brought it to the commissioning editors of BBC One, who negotiated with Carlton to broadcast it. By that time, the top levels of the ITV drama department had changed and due to Carlton's links with ITV, the BBC was unable to take the series. A six-episode series was commissioned in July 2002 by Nick Elliott at ITV.", "Writing in The Guardian a fortnight later, ITV head of drama David Liddiment defended the decision, stating that the network had planned to let Making Waves profit from The Bill's (the lead-in) high ratings at a time when BBC One Wednesday night ratings were suffering, but the series just \"wasn't good enough\" to hold an audience. Ted Childs later responded that Making Waves had received little publicity compared to Channel4's ratings smash Supernanny, which aired opposite his series, and that because that programme had ended its run, the ratings for the last three episodes might have improved. He went on to question why ITV had spent \u00a35 million on a series they knew would not be a hit. Making Waves had been another in a line of expensive series which had been cancelled because they performed below ITV's expectations in the ratings, following Sweet Medicine and Family the previous year."]}, {"page": "St Bonaventure's", "response": ["* Ted Childs, film and TV producer"]}, {"page": "British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series", "response": ["| The Sweeney || Ted Childs"]}, {"page": "Richard Maher", "response": ["Richard Maher is a British screenwriter, author and playwright.
