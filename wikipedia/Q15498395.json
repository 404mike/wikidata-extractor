Resuming his stage career in 1919 he appeared mostly in the West End, with one excursion to Broadway and occasional tours of the British provinces, particularly during the Second World War. He was dismissive of his career as a screen actor, but made more than 40 films for the cinema. As a theatre director he was responsible for more than 20 productions, in a minority of which he also starred.\nIn his later years he had heart problems, which forced his temporary withdrawal from the theatre in 1957. He died of a heart attack in the South of France in 1962, at the age of 65. He was unmarried.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rich and Strange", "response": ["A couple, Fred (Henry Kendall) and Emily Hill (Joan Barry), living a mundane middle-class life in London, receive a letter informing them that an uncle will give them, as an advance against their future inheritance, as much money as they need to enjoy themselves in the present.
