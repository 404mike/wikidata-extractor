The ensuing years saw a rapid surge in economic growth, a country-wide expansion of infrastructure as well as a period of regional integration and social development. ", "Direct British rule in the Cape Colony had recently been replaced by responsible government, and the newly elected Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope in Cape Town, under the liberal Molteno-Merriman government, resented the perceived high-handed manner in which Lord Carnarvon presented his proposals from afar without an understanding of local affairs. It also suspected him of manoeuvring to consolidate British control over the region's states, reverse the Cape's independence, and bring on a war with the neighbouring Xhosa Chiefs. Molteno's government raised the additional concern, transmitted to London by Sir Henry Barkly, that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would endanger the rights and franchise of the Cape's black citizens; if there was to be any form of union, the Cape's non-racialism would need to be implemented in the Boer republics, and could not be compromised.N.

In particular, the local Cape government took a non-interventionist approach towards the neighbouring Boer and Black African states of southern Africa. It was also relatively liberal in its domestic politics. Its formal response to Carnarvon's confederation model, conveyed to London via Frere's predecessor Sir Henry Barkly, had originally been that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would endanger the rights and franchise of the Cape's Black citizens, and was therefore unacceptable. It now resolutely opposed British confederation as being an imperialist attempt to override the Cape's constitution and extend British control over the whole of southern Africa. They also saw that confederation would entail a British invasion of the remaining independent states of the region, such as Zululand and Transvaal, and they correctly predicted war and instability. The summary of Molteno's message was that \"the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside.\""]}, {"page": "Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon", "response": ["The Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (by far the largest and most influential state in southern Africa) firmly rejected confederation under Britain, saying that it was not a model that was applicable to the diverse region, and that conflict would result from outside involvement in southern Africa at a time when state relations were particularly sensitive. The liberal Cape government also objected to the plan for ideological concerns; Its formal response, conveyed to London via Sir Henry Barkly, had been that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would compromise the rights and franchise of the Cape's Black citizens, and was therefore unacceptable. Other regional governments refused even to discuss the idea. Overall, the opinion of the governments of the Cape and its neighbours was that \"the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside.\""]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1856", "response": ["* Victoria \u2013 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1857", "response": ["* Victoria \u2013 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1858", "response": ["* Victoria \u2013 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1859", "response": ["* Victoria \u2013 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1860", "response": ["* Victoria \u2013 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1861", "response": ["* Victoria \u2013 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1862", "response": ["* Victoria \u2013 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1863", "response": ["*# Sir Henry Barkly", "*# Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria (1856\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "Griqualand West", "response": ["By December of the same year about 10 000 British settlers made their home in the new republic.
