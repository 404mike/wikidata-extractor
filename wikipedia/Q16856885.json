He is best known from his engravings in Punch magazine of cartoons by Sir John Tenniel.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Hunting of the Snark", "response": ["To illustrate the poem Carroll chose Henry Holiday, whom he had met in 1869 or 1870. At the time Carroll approached him to ask if he could create three illustrations for the poem, Carroll had completed three \u2018fits\u2019, as he called the parts of his poem \u2014 fit can mean either canto or convulsion \u2014 \"The Landing\", \"The Hunting\", and \"The Vanishing\". He intended to title it The Boojum and include it in his fantasy novel Sylvie and Bruno, which was unfinished at the time. However, in late October 1875, Carroll thought about having it published during Christmas; this proved impossible, as the wood engraving for the illustrations needed three months to be complete. By the time Holiday had completed the sketches and sent them to Carroll, Carroll had already created a new fit requiring an illustration. They worked this way until Holiday had created nine illustrations as well as the front cover and the back cover of the book. Thus, among the ten illustrations shown below, one illustration is not by Holiday.The front page of The Hunting of the Snark (1876) states: \u201cwith nine illustrations by Henry Holiday\u201d. The assumption is that the \"Ocean Chart\" (aka \"The Bellman's Map\") has been arranged by Carroll. Source:  The \"Ocean Chart\" is typographic art whereas electrotypes made from Joseph Swain's woodblock engravings were used to print Holiday's illustrations."]}, {"page": "George John Pinwell", "response": ["Cundall states that Pinwell made many small watercolours \"of subjects which he had already produced in black-and-white\". His first exhibited watercolour, An Incident in the Life of Oliver Goldsmith, shown in the Dudley Gallery in 1865, was based on the themes and imagery he had used for Dalziel's Illustrated Goldsmith. In the following example the black-and-white engraving was prepared from the watercolour. Note that the engraving Joseph Swain is reversed from the watercolour, a normal feature of engravings as the final print is a mirror image of the engraving. The engraving was cropped before printing it in Once a Week on 26 June 1869. It also suffers from being marked with a partial impression of the text from the following page. This was the only illustration by Pinwell appearing in that volume of the magazine. The watercolour was one of the three paintings submitted by Pinwell for membership of the Water Colour Society. The Globe stated that the watercolour was \"dramatic in feeling\" and showed \"the most accurate perception of individual character.\" The Graphic described the work as \"a scene of every-day observation ,yet most pathetically rendered. At one end of the bench a street musician and her child are counting their scanty gains, at the other end a soldier flirts with a nurse, while between the two sits such a specimen of shabby gentility as would have assuredly won Thackeray's heart.\""]}, {"page": "Edward Linley Sambourne", "response": ["In 1861 Sambourne was apprenticed to John Penn & Son, marine engineers of Greenwich. Initially he worked under the founder's son, John Penn Jr, but was moved to the drawing office when his employer discovered his aptitude for draft drawing. In his spare time Sambourne continued to draw caricatures and study the great graphic artists such as William Hogarth and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. One version Sambourne recounts about the events leading to his introduction to Punch's editor Mark Lemon is that his friend and fellow employee at Penn's, Alfred German Reed, showed one of his sketches to his father, the theatrical impresario Thomas German Reed. At his son's urging Thomas passed the drawing on to Mark Lemon. Lemon was sufficiently impressed by the sketch that he encouraged Sambourne to take art lessons and consult the engraver Joseph Swain about drawing on wood. Pleased with the results, Lemon published a drawing by Sambourne in the 27 April 1867 issue of Punch. This was an initial letter 'T' showing the politician John Bright striking a quintain."]}, {"page": "Frederick Sandys", "response": ["Some of the first introductions to Pre-Raphaelite teachings emerged in magazines, such as  Once a Week, the Cornhill Magazine, Good Words and Sunday Magazine. Sandys began drawing in the 1860s for Once a Week, the Cornhill Magazine, Good Words and other periodicals, his work influenced by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Ambrosius Holbein, and Alfred Rethel.  Sandys made a total of 26 between 1859 and 1866, but each was a fine representation of this genre, faithfully engraved by professional wood-engravers, including the Dalziel brothers and Joseph Swain, and they are worthy of the collector's portfolio. For the engravers to be successful in carving the intricate illustrations onto wood, they needed to start with a detailed, clear design from the artist. Sandys had an eye and talent for exacting detail, an intention to accurately reflect the subject, revealed in the quality of his works, equally impressive for its technical detail as for its imaginative point of view."]}, {"page": "Ebenezer Landells", "response": ["In 1829 he moved to London, and before long managed to start his own engraving workshop.  After attempting a short-lived fashion journal, Cosmorama, he joined with the journalist Henry Mayhew and the printer William Last to found Punch in 1841. Initial difficulties forced Landells to sell his one-third share to the publishers Bradbury & Evans: after the new owners replaced Landells with Joseph Swain as engraving chief, Landells responded with a pamphlet A Word with Punch (1847)."]}, {"page": "Frederick Walker (painter)", "response": ["In 1859 he joined the Artists' society in Langham Chambers, and from 1860\u201365 achieved great success as a black and white illustrator for popular journals of the day such as Cornhill Magazine, Once a Week, Good Words, Everybody's Journal, and Leisure Hour.Walker's first published illustration was in Everybody's Journal, 14 January 1860, for a story by Edmond About called \"The Round of Wrong\" (Phillips, p. 11). Much of his work during this period was engraved by Joseph Swain. He was introduced to satirist and author William Thackeray, the Cornhill's editor, for whom he provided drawings (e.g. \"Comfort in grief\") for \"The Adventures of Philip\", initially published as a serial but then as a book in 1862. He also illustrated Thackeray's unfinished novel \"Denis Duval\", magazine stories by Thackeray's daughter Ann Ritchie (many of these drawings later reproduced in watercolour), and provided drawings (e.g. \"Summer days\") for the Dalziel brothers which appeared in 2 poetry books, \"A Round of Days\" and \"Wayside Posies\"."]}, {"page": "Joseph Swain (poet)", "response": ["Joseph Swain (1761 \u2013 14 April 1796) was a British Baptist minister, poet and hymnwriter.
