Wilkinson signed professional forms with Manchester United in December 1903 but was allowed to move to Hull City, who at that point were only competing in friendly games. When Hull joined the Second Division, United demanded \u00a3150 for his transfer, a sum the Yorkshire club were unable to afford. With West Ham United competing in the Southern League, outside of the Football League structure and not bound by their rules, they were able to sign Wilkinson for nothing.He made his Hammers debut on 16 September 1905 in a 1\u20132 defeat against Luton Town at Upton Park and made 15 league appearances for the club.He later played for Haslingden, Bury, Oswaldtwistle Rovers, and Rochdale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Wilkinson", "response": ["Harry Wilkinson may refer to:", "*Harry Wilkinson (footballer, born 1883) (1883\u2013?), English footballer", "*Harry Wilkinson (footballer, born 1926), English footballer", "*Harry Wilkinson (rugby) (1864\u20131942), rugby union footballer of the 1880s for England and Halifax", "*Harry Wilkinson (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s", "*Harry Wilkinson (rugby union) (1903\u20131988), rugby union footballer of the 1920s and 1930s for England and Halifax", "*Harry Wilkinson Moore (1850\u20131915), English architect"]}, {"page": "Harry Wilkinson (footballer born 1883)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Wilkinson (footballer, born 1883)"]}, {"page": "Henry Wilkinson (footballer, born 1883)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Wilkinson (footballer, born 1883)"]}]}}
