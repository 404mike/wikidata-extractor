He spent time on loan with North American Soccer League team Team Hawaii for the franchise's single season under the moniker, playing with former Hammer Y\u0131lmaz Orhan. He played his last game for the east London club on 5 March 1977 against Sunderland.Robson moved to Cardiff City in August 1977, having scored 19 goals in 87 games for West Ham.

He went on to play for Norwich City, where he teamed up with ex-West Ham players Alan Taylor, Graham Paddon, Martin Peters and John McDowell. The \u00a325,000 signing scored 13 goals in 65 games for the Carrow Road club before moving to Leicester City.

Just before half-time, Frank Lampard misjudged a back pass, allowing Peter Ressel to collect the ball and pass it to Rob Rensenbrink to score the equaliser. In attempting the backpass, Lampard tore a stomach muscle that ruled him out of much of the remainder of the game. Three minutes into the second-half, Fran\u00e7ois van der Elst scored, assisted by Rensenbrink. Keith Robson later equalised for West Ham from a cross by Trevor Brooking. Anderlecht were awarded a clear penalty in the 73rd minute, after Holland rashly challenged and fouled Rensenbrink who then scored from the penalty.
