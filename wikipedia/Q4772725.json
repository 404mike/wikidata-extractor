He has also published translations of opera and Ancient Greek poetry, as well as several autobiographical books about poker. In 2009, he was elected the first President of the International Federation of Poker (IFP).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cholera", "response": ["* Tchaikovsky's death has traditionally been attributed to cholera, most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier.Brown, Man and Music, 430\u201332; Holden, 371; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 269\u2013270. Tchaikovsky's mother died of cholera,David Brown, Early Years, 46. and his father became sick with cholera at this time but made a full recovery.Holden, 23. Some scholars, however, including English musicologist and Tchaikovsky authority David Brown and biographer Anthony Holden, have theorized that his death was a suicide.Brown, Man and Music, 431\u201335; Holden, 373\u2013400."]}, {"page": "George Bernard Shaw", "response": ["Despite his contempt for Hollywood and its aesthetic values, Shaw was enthusiastic about cinema, and in the middle of the decade wrote screenplays for prospective film versions of Pygmalion and Saint Joan. The latter was never made, but Shaw entrusted the rights to the former to the unknown Gabriel Pascal, who produced it at Pinewood Studios in 1938. Shaw was determined that Hollywood should have nothing to do with the film, but was powerless to prevent it from winning one Academy Award (\"Oscar\"); he described his award for \"best-written screenplay\" as an insult, coming from such a source. He became the first person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. In a 1993 study of the Oscars, Anthony Holden observes that Pygmalion was soon spoken of as having \"lifted movie-making from illiteracy to literacy\"."]}, {"page": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["Diana was widely known for her encounters with sick and dying patients, and the poor and unwanted whom she used to comfort, an action that earned her more popularity. She was mindful of people's thoughts and feelings, and later revealed her wish to become a beloved figure among the people, saying in her 1995 interview, that \"[She would] like to be a queen of people's hearts, in people's hearts.\" Known for her easygoing attitude, she reportedly hated formality in her inner circle, asking \"people not to jump up every time she enters the room\". Diana is often credited with widening the range of charity works carried out by the royal family in a more modern style. Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post wrote in an article that \"Diana imbued her role as royal princess with vitality, activism and, above all, glamour.\" Alicia Carroll of The New York Times described Diana as \"a breath of fresh air\" who was the main reason the royal family was known in the United States. In Anthony Holden's opinion, Diana was \"visibly reborn\" after her separation from Charles, a point in her life that was described by Holden as her \"moment of triumph\", which put her on an independent path to success."]}, {"page": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky", "response": ["Tchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin.Maes, 73; Taruskin, Grove Opera, 664. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged to not just Russia but also the world at large. Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture\u2014the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him to become the first Russian composer to acquaint foreign audiences personally with his own works, Warrack writes, as well as those of other Russian composers.Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 209. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: \"Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into 20th-century music. Between these two very different worlds, Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge\".Holden, xxi."]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier", "response": ["Osborne was already at work on a new play, The Entertainer, an allegory of Britain's post-colonial decline, centred on a seedy variety comedian, Archie Rice. Having read the first act\u2014all that was completed by then\u2014Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called \"Larry Oliver\", and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie's brazen fa\u00e7ade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, in the words of the biographer Anthony Holden, \"from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos\". Tony Richardson's production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the Palace Theatre in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace. The role of Archie's daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was Joan Plowright, with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life. Olivier said that playing Archie \"made me feel like a modern actor again\". In finding an avant-garde play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade. Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne's generation were Alan Bennett's Forty Years On (Gielgud in 1968) and David Storey's Home (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970)."]}, {"page": "Texas hold 'em", "response": ["The English journalist and biographer Anthony Holden spent a year on the professional poker circuit from 1988\u20131989 and wrote about his experiences in Big Deal: A Year as a Professional Poker Player.

Mary Arden was from a Catholic family. A tract, apparently signed by John Shakespeare, in which he pledged to remain a Catholic in his heart, was found in the 18th century in the rafters of a house on Henley Street. It was seen and described by scholar Edmond Malone but apparently was subsequently lost.  Anthony Holden writes that Malone's reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by Charles Borromeo and circulated in England by Edmund Campion, copies of which still exist in Italian and English.Holden, Anthony. William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius  Little, Brown (2000). Other research suggests the Borromeo testament dated from 1638 at the earliest and could never have been in the possession of John Shakespeare.Bearman, R., \"John Shakespeare's Spiritual Testament, a reappraisal\", Shakespeare Survey 56 [2003] pp. 184\u2013204.

She may have been a simpleton, a woman of common ideas and tastes, as she has been described dismissively. Responsibility for the failure of the marriage may actually lie more with Tchaikovsky than with her. \"In truth,\" Tchaikovsky's biographer Anthony Holden suggests, \"Antonina was as much the right woman for Tchaikovsky as any other.

He also inherited Althorp, the family's ancestral seat in Northamptonshire. Since 2009, he has restored Althorp, re-roofing it and restoring its entire exterior for the first time since the 1780s.

Holden states that the chances of both such hands appearing in one deal are \"a laughable\" 332,220,508,619 to 1 (more than 332 billion to 1 against) and goes on: \"If these two played 50 hands of stud an hour, eight hours a day, five days a week, the situation would arise about once every 443 years.\"  Nevertheless, the nature of probability is that even if something is possible, however unlikely, it nevertheless might happen, and therefore is certainly not an impossibility.

Ursula K. Le Guin said, \"I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it to find out what the fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a 'school novel,' good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited.\""]}, {"page": "Heads Up with Richard Herring", "response": ["* Episode 6: Grub Smith, Anthony Holden, Major Charles Ingram & Diana Ingram"]}, {"page": "Antony Holden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anthony Holden"]}, {"page": "That Hamilton Woman", "response": ["Critical sources usually point out that That Hamilton Woman was Winston Churchill's favorite film.Lasky 1978, pp. 133\u2013134.
