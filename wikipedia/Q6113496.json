He played as an outside left.\nKirton was born in Hulme, which was then in Lancashire. He played for Glossop North End and Oldham County of the Combination before joining Football League Second Division club Lincoln City in May 1896. From then on, he changed club at the end of each season. With Small Heath in the Second Division, he created many of Walter Abbott's 19 goals in the 1897\u201398 season. His next move was to Swindon Town of the Southern League, then First Division club Sunderland, where he never achieved a first-team place. A return to Swindon preceded a final move in the 1901 close season, this time to Millwall Athletic, also of the Southern League.He died in Kilburn, London, in 1939 at the age of 67.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1896\u201397 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["The Dart's initial opinion was that the standard of replacement for Hodgetts, who had been reinstated as an amateur, Jones and Farnall\u00a0\u2013 \"two or three players who have done well with local clubs have been signed up, and a smart left-wing forward in Kirton, of Lincoln City, has also been secured\"\u00a0\u2013 but as the directors preferred to spend their money on ground improvements, in the shape of the purchase of Aston Villa's old stands from the Perry Barr ground, rather than on \"stars\", these would be inadequate to return the club to the First Division.\"Sports Gossip\".
