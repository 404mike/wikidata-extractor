Stoy is a British computer scientist. He originally studied physics at Oxford University. Early in his career, in the 1970s, he worked on denotational semantics with Christopher Strachey in the Programming Research Group at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Oxford University Department of Computer Science). He was a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He has also spent time at MIT in the United States. In 2003, he co-founded Bluespec, Inc.\nHis book Denotational Semantics: The Scott-Strachey Approach to Programming Language Semantics (MIT Press, 1977) is now a classic text.Stoy married Gabrielle Stoy, a mathematician and Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BCS-FACS", "response": ["In recent years, a series of evening seminars have been held, mainly at the BCS London office.
