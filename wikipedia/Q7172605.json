From an EE professorship at the University of Edinburgh, he went on to found VLSI Vision Inc., later known as VISION Group plc, an early maker of CMOS image sensors that sold itself to STMicroelectronics. The first academic to grow a Scottish university spin-out company to PLC, he was described by the Royal Society as \"a unique combination of electronics engineer, distinguished academic, inventor, company CEO and multiple entrepreneur.\"\"To say that Denyer 'invented' the mobile phone camera,\" wrote one obituarist, \"would be unfair to the rest of his research team at the University of Edinburgh and to parallel researchers worldwide....But, although the camera phone phenomenon was but a twinkle in Denyer's eye when he started out, he became internationally recognised as a driving force in the technology known as CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) which still features in hundreds of millions of mobile phones around the globe.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*22 April \u2013 Peter B.
