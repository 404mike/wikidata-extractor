Dines was a right-handed batsman who bowled both right-arm off break and right-arm medium pace, though his medium pace bowler was his primary bowling style.  He was born at Colchester, Essex.\nDines made his first-class debut for Essex against Surrey in 1947.  He made nineteen further first-class appearances, the last of which came against Cambridge University in 1949.  In his twenty first-class appearances for Essex, he scored 431 runs at an average of 18.73, with a high score of 69 not out.  This score, which was one of two fifties he made, came against Sussex in 1947.  After tasting instant success in his first County Championship match against Northamptonshire in 1947, in which he took the wickets of Harold Walker and Bill Barron in his second over of the match, Dines later found wickets harder to come by.  In total he took 15, which came at a bowling average of 65.33, with best figures of 3/35.He died at Gidea Park, Essex on 14 June 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Essex matches were noted for high scores as Essex themselves scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most. Their two outstanding players were the cousins Peter and Ray Smith who both completed the double. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect Trevor Bailey was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder Frank Vigar took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain Tom Pearce, Chick Cray, Dickie Dodds and Doug Insole. Wicketkeeper Tom Wade had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped. Essex were also represented by Bill Dines, Bill Morris, Denys Wilcox, Dick Horsfall, Frank Rist, Harry Crabtree, Len Clark and Sonny Avery.Playfair, pp. 100\u2013102."]}, {"page": "Dines", "response": ["* Bill Dines (1916\u20131992), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Harold Walker (cricketer)", "response": ["Walker made his only first-class appearance for Northamptonshire against Essex in 1947.
