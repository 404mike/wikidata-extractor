He is best known for writing The Life of John Maynard Keynes (1951) and for the development of the Harrod\u2013Domar model, which he and Evsey Domar developed independently. He is also known for his International Economics, a former standard textbook, the first edition of which contained some observations and ruminations (wanting in subsequent editions) that would foreshadow theories developed independently by later scholars (such as the Balassa\u2013Samuelson effect).\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
