He is best known for writing The Life of John Maynard Keynes (1951) and for the development of the Harrod\u2013Domar model, which he and Evsey Domar developed independently. He is also known for his International Economics, a former standard textbook, the first edition of which contained some observations and ruminations (wanting in subsequent editions) that would foreshadow theories developed independently by later scholars (such as the Balassa\u2013Samuelson effect).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Classical liberalism", "response": ["The changing economic and social conditions of the 19th century led to a division between neo-classical and social (or welfare) liberals, who while agreeing on the importance of individual liberty differed on the role of the state.  Neo-classical liberals, who called themselves \"true liberals\", saw Locke's Second Treatise as the best guide and emphasised \"limited government\" while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare state. Herbert Spencer in Britain and William Graham Sumner were the leading neo-classical liberal theorists of the 19th century. The evolution from classical to social/welfare liberalism is for example reflected in Britain in the evolution of the thought of John Maynard Keynes.See the studies of Keynes by Roy Harrod, Robert Skidelsky, Donald Moggridge and Donald Markwell."]}, {"page": "Globalization", "response": ["The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic interdependence promotes peace.E.g.  This idea had been very powerful during the globalization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was a central doctrine of classical liberals of that era, such as the young John Maynard Keynes (1883\u20131946).See, for example, Roy Harrod, The Life of John Maynard Keynes, Macmillan, 1951; Donald Markwell, John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace, Oxford University Press, 2006. Keynes had colourfully described the globalization before World War I in The Economic Consequences of the Peace, Macmillan, 1919, chapter 2."]}, {"page": "IS\u2013LM model", "response": ["Keynes created, developed,improved and taught his original IS-LM model to his students from 1933 to 1935. Later the IS\u2013LM model was introduced at a conference of the Econometric Society held in Oxford during September 1936. Roy Harrod, John R. Hicks, and James Meade all presented papers"]}, {"page": "Suez Crisis", "response": [" The economist Roy Harrod wrote at the time that the \"more level-headed British, whom I believe to be in the majority though not the most vocal\" were supporting the \"notable act of courage and statesmanship\" of the government. Eden himself claimed that his mail went from eight to one against the military action immediately after its start, to four to one in support on the day before the ceasefire.Sir Anthony Eden, Full Circle (London: Cassell, 1960), p. 546."]}]}}
