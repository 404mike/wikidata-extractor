He also has two children with Sheila Jackson (Maggie O'Neill), Nigel and Delia, and is the father of Monica's half-sister, whom he fathered with Monica's mother at Monica's birthday party. He has two grandchildren, Lip's daughter, Katie Maguire, and an unnamed child of Fiona's. During one of Frank's drunken rants, it is implied that he got many girls pregnant in school. Although this is never elaborated upon, it is unclear precisely how many children Frank has actually fathered.", "Monica Gallagher (born 24 April 1963) is Frank Gallagher's (David Threlfall) estranged wife, and the mother of Fiona (Anne-Marie Duff), Lip (Jody Latham), Ian (Gerard Kearns), Carl (Elliott Tittensor), Debbie (Rebecca Ryan), Liam (Johnny Bennett) and Stella (Nikita Brownlee). She is bisexual and left Frank for a lorry driver named Norma Starkey (Dystin Johnson). She came home at the end of series 1 but had left by the start of series 2, she then returned for good at the beginning of series 4 and resumed co-habiting with Frank. Although her intentions for this were unknown at first, a visit from her mother in series 5 explained her backstory and a possible reason of why she returned to be with her children. Monica announced at the beginning of series 5 that she was pregnant again, giving birth to Stella at the end of the series. She has two known grandchildren, an unnamed child from Fiona when she left in Series 2, and Lip's daughter, Katie Maguire.

She is Frank (David Threlfall) and Monica Gallagher's (Annabelle Apsion) second eldest daughter. Lip (Jody Latham), Carl (Elliott Tittensor) and Liam (Johnny Bennett) are her brothers. Her sisters are Fiona (Anne-Marie Duff) and Stella (Nikita Brownlee); her half-brothers are Ian (Gerard Kearns) and Nigel; and her half-sister is Delia. Although Debbie is only 16 (at the time of her last appearance on the show in 2009), she is old beyond her years because she grew up without a mother and undertook the majority of the domestic tasks, At the start of the series Debbie tended to use her childlike innocence to get out of any mess she or family get themselves into. Since Fiona went to Amsterdam, Debbie is often tasked with saving the family from ruin. For example, she steps in when Liam denounces God and the school he attends makes a move to expel him. Although the results are disastrous, she shows herself to be a diligent individual upon whom her family can depend. Originally Debbie was presented as a slightly unusual and awkward child, she retains her high intelligence and resourcefulness throughout the show. This allows Debbie to be successful when she becomes head of the household and takes care of the domestic duties such as cooking, ironing, cleaning and taking Liam to school. She also provides her family members with a high level of emotional support. As a consequence, Debbie missed out on socialising and has become mature beyond her years. When Fiona left Chatsworth at the end of series 2, Debbie seemed, at first, to relish the responsibility of running Gallagher household. Debbie appeared in 65 episodes in total.", "Carl Gallagher (born 18 January 1990) is a fictional character from the Channel 4 drama Shameless; he is the fourth oldest Gallagher sibling.

Like before, Stella's siblings, primarily Debbie (Rebecca Ryan), Liam (Johnny Bennett) and Carl (Elliott Tittensor), look after her, while Frank and Monica continue with their previous disastrous parenting. During Series 6, Monica walks out on the family again, leading to Social Services temporarily taking Liam and Stella into care, however neighbours Yvonne Karib (Kelli Hollis) and Stan Waterman (Warren Donnelly) offer to foster them in order to keep them close to the Gallaghers. When Frank's new partner Libby Croker (Pauline McLynn), her mother Patty (Valerie Lilley) and their relative Aidan (Robbie Conway) move in, all of them look after Stella alongside Liam and Carl, while Frank continues to neglect his children.", "Nin Gallagher is Frank Gallagher's (David Threlfall) grandmother who appears in the first episode of series 7 of Shameless. She apparently brought Frank up and rescued him from a life of misery at the hands of her son Neville (John Woodvine), Frank's father. She is somewhat resentful of Frank, calling him a \"selfish little shit\". She is close to all of his children, especially her great-grandson Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett). She is the carer for her husband Jonty, who does nothing but eat. Out of desperation, she shoots Jonty dead in front of Frank and willingly goes to prison for it. She is last seen when she is visited by Liam and Ian Gallagher (Gerard Kearns), and appears to be loving prison life, deliberately causing a prison riot to extend her sentence as she wants to spend the rest of her life in prison.", "While giving a deposit to a sperm bank, Shane learned that he was sterile. Shane was upset at the thought of never having children. His father and brothers tried to help by offering to be sperm donors for Kelly, but she refused. Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett) suggested Kelly and Shane raise Shane's niece Katie, but this plan was dashed when her father Lip Gallagher (Jody Latham) decided to take her. Shane was left to look on Liam as a son.", "Shane was deeply upset when he learned he was sterile. Jamie, Paddy and Micky Maguire (Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths) offered to be Kelly's sperm donors, but she refused, saying she'd already had Paddy in her once and wasn't going to do that ever again. As they would be unable to adopt a child, Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett) convinced them to try to be parents to Shane's niece Katie. This plan was dashed when Katie's father Lip decided to take a more active role in her life. Kelly and Shane decided to give up on their plans and just be honorary parental figures for Liam, whom she has grown quite fond of.", "Elizabeth \"Libby\" Croker (born 1967) is Frank Gallagher's (David Threlfall) third major love interest. She is a librarian who lives with her disabled mother, Patty Croker (Valerie Lilley), for whom she is sole carer, giving up her own independent existence. Libby is narcoleptic. In the most recent episode, she has moved in with Frank, after being released from prison for inciting a riot. Her mother has also moved in with the Gallaghers, living in their front room, and has been set up as a counterpoint to Frank, both of whom consider the other as \"fakers\" regarding their illnesses. Libby's moving into the Gallagher home has not been welcomed by Frank's sons. Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett) in particular has demonstrated a rather cold attitude toward Libby, perhaps because he fears that the relationship is doomed to failure anyway, and doesn't want to get too friendly with Libby. However, Libby has gradually been accepted by most of the family. In episode 13 of Series 8 Libby was found to be exchanging love letters with a colleague. The colleague was later found out to be a figment of her imagination borne out of a desperate need for affection.", "Aidan Croker (born 8 December 1995) arrives to the Chatsworth estate in the eighth series, and fills the void left by Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett). He is introduced to the series when he has been sent to live with his aunt, Patty Croker (Valerie Lilley) and godmother Libby Croker (Pauline McLynn). During his first episode, he was already shown to be a trouble-maker; beating up neighbour Jackson Powell (Emmanuel Ighodaro), and buying internet porn with Libby's credit card.", "The murderer, Jimmy, in turn prevented them from going forward to the police by threatening to kill Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett), and tells them to leave Chatsworth. After spending some time at a Welsh farm with a woman called Hazel, who has her own murky past which Chesney helped her resolve, both he and Carl decided to return to Chatsworth to clear their names. When entering a football competition for gays, Chesney argues with Ian over his homosexual relationship with Kash long ago. Towards the end of the penultimate episode, Chesney has a dream including fellows homosexuals Micky Maguire (Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths) and Ian Gallagher (Gerard Kearns), and it is assumed that he may actually have homosexual feelings himself. These feelings progress in the eighth series when along with Micky, he starts up a gay sex line and begins to enjoy it far too much. Chesney appeared in 85 episodes overall.", "Norma accompanies Monica back to the Gallagher home in series 4, and lives in the Dormobile in the garden. She is infatuated with Monica and continues to express her strong feelings for her lover even when Monica ignores her and endeavours to capture Frank's attention. Having initially been characterised as a strong-willed and capable woman, Norma increasingly portrayed as vulnerable and helpless. In series 4, Norma reveals that before her relationship with Monica, she spent time in prison. Norma expresses dissatisfaction with her living conditions, much to Debbie Gallagher's (Rebecca Ryan) annoyance who tells her to \"put some effort in\" after saying that she mooches off them almost as much as her parents do. This prompts Norma to erect a white picket fence around the Dormobile. She also is a person upon whom other members of the family can depend. For example, when Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett) is granted the opportunity to attend school abroad, she willingly pretends to be Frank's wife. She also proves herself to be a good listener when she gives Carl Gallagher (Elliott Tittensor) advice, even though Carl makes it blatantly obvious that he does not like Norma and wants his mother."]}, {"page": "List of British former child actors", "response": ["*Johnny Bennett (born 1998)"]}, {"page": "Ian Gallagher", "response": ["Ian Gallagher is the third oldest Gallagher sibling and is aged 15 at the beginning of the first series in 2000.
