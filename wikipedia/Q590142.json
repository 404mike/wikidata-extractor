He made his second appearance in the quarter-finals of a Triple Crown tournament at the 2016 UK Championship.\nJones made the 141st official maximum break in the third frame of his last 64 match against Lee Walker at the 2018 Paul Hunter Classic. It was his first professional maximum break.\nIn October 2018, Jones was suspended from the snooker tour pending a match fixing investigation. \nThe match in question was a 2016 International Championship qualifier between former world champion Graeme Dott and Jones\u2019 good friend and compatriot David John.\nIn January 2019, Jones was acquitted of match-fixing following a hearing at which he was represented by sports barrister Craig Harris. However, he admitted to having prior knowledge of an approach to fix the aforementioned match and failed to report it, so was subsequently banned for a year himself.\nWhilst his ban finished in October 2019, due to missing out most of the 2018\u201319 season, he ended the campaign outside of the top 64 and officially dropped off the tour.\nJones officially re-joined the tour two seasons later, coming through the second Q-School event of 2020, defeating Michael Georgiou.
