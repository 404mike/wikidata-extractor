He began his football career with home-town club Atherstone Town, and joined Football League champions Huddersfield Town in November 1924, but moved on to Barnsley a year later without appearing for the first team. After 20 games in 18 months for Barnsley, Johnson, an outside left, returned to the Midlands with Birmingham. He played a run of games in the early part of the 1927\u201328 season, but his performances on the field failed to live up to those on the training ground. He lost his place to Billy Ellis, and moved on to Bristol City at the end of the season. Johnson played 62 games in all competitions for Bristol City before returning nearer home once more to finish off his career at Coventry City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Atherstone", "response": ["* Arthur Johnson (1903\u20131987) an English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Arthur Johnson", "response": ["Arthur Johnson may refer to:", "*Arthur Johnson (boxer) (born 1966), U.S. Olympic boxer", "*Arthur Johnson (rugby league), Widnes and Great Britain 1908/09 - 1922/23", "*Arthur Johnson (footballer, born 1879) (1879\u2013?), Anglo-Irish footballer and manager in the 1910s and 1920s", "*Arthur Johnson (footballer, born 1886), English half back prior to the First World War", "*Arthur Johnson (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131987), English footballer in the 1920s and early 1930s", "*Arthur Johnson (footballer, born 1933), English goalkeeper in the 1950s and 1960s", "*Arthur Johnson (canoeist) (born 1921), Canadian Olympic canoer in the 1950s", "*Arthur Johnson (basketball) (born 1982), American basketball player", "*Arthur Johnson (historian) (1845\u20131927), English historian", "*Arthur Johnson (professor), Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford 1827\u20131829", "*Arthur Johnson (musician), drummer and original member of Boston rock band Come", "*Arthur Johnson, English watchmaker and originator of hybridisation of Hippeastrum ", "*Arthur Johnson (Army general)"]}, {"page": "Wilf Threlfall", "response": ["Threlfall made his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on the opening day of the 1927\u201328 season, and he and Arthur Johnson shared the outside left position for the next couple of months.Matthews, pp. 101, 170.
