He began his football career with home-town club Atherstone Town, and joined Football League champions Huddersfield Town in November 1924, but moved on to Barnsley a year later without appearing for the first team. After 20 games in 18 months for Barnsley, Johnson, an outside left, returned to the Midlands with Birmingham. He played a run of games in the early part of the 1927\u201328 season, but his performances on the field failed to live up to those on the training ground. He lost his place to Billy Ellis, and moved on to Bristol City at the end of the season. Johnson played 62 games in all competitions for Bristol City before returning nearer home once more to finish off his career at Coventry City.", "link_mentions": {}}}
