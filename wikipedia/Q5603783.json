In 1861\u201362 he was one of three astronomers to successfully observe the dark underside of the rings of Saturn, the other two astronomers being William Wray and Otto Struve.In 1871, the engineer James Nasmyth partnered with James Carpenter to produce a book about the Moon titled, The Moon: Considered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite. This work was illustrated by photographs of plaster models representing the lunar surface, with the illumination from various angles. The result was more realistic images of the lunar surface than could be achieved by telescope photography during that period. The authors were proponents for a volcanic origin of the craters, a theory that was later proved incorrect.The crater Carpenter on the Moon is jointly named after him and Edwin Francis Carpenter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| James Carpenter || UK || 1840 || 1899", "*James Carpenter (UK, 1840\u20131899)"]}, {"page": "James Nasmyth", "response": ["Nasmyth retired from business in 1856 when he was 48 years old, as he said \"I have now enough of this world's goods: let younger men have their chance\".  He settled down near Penshurst, Kent, where he renamed his retirement home \"Hammerfield\" and happily pursued his various hobbies including astronomy.  He built his own 20-inch reflecting telescope, in the process inventing the Nasmyth focus, and made detailed observations of the Moon.  He co-wrote The Moon: Considered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite (1874) with James Carpenter (1840\u20131899).  This book contains an interesting series of \"lunar\" photographs: because photography was not yet advanced enough to take pictures at very high magnification directly of the Moon itself, Nasmyth built plaster relief scale models based on his visual observations of the Moon and then photographed the models under electric illumination, replicating the shadows of the topographic contours he observed on the Moon.
