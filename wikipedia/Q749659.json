In the October 2013 Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, he became Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. After Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader in September 2015, Lewis was dismissed from the shadow cabinet.\nLewis was suspended from the Labour Party in November 2017 after sexual misconduct allegations. He subsequently resigned from the Labour Party in December 2018, citing his concerns about antisemitism in the party and the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn..  Lewis sat as an independent MP until the 2019 General Election, when he stood as an independent candidate in Bury South. During the campaign Lewis urged voters to support the Conservatives rather than himself when it became clear his candidature could allow Labour to win and inadvertently boost Corbyn's chances of becoming Prime Minister.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 4", "response": ["*  1967   \u2013 Ivan Lewis, English lawyer and politician, Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Ivan Lewis", "| Ivan Lewis"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ivan Lewis"]}, {"page": "Mark Hendrick", "response": ["In Parliament, Hendrick was a member of the European Scrutiny Select Committee for three years from 2001.
