She appeared in the character of Lady Eleanor Irwin, in Elizabeth Inchbald's comedy Everyone has his Fault after which she delivered a very neat and appropriate address. There was a full house, but we are sorry to say the season has been productive of very few even tolerable houses.\" The recently redecorated theatre was offered for sale by auction at the White Hart Inn in May 1843. The Robertson company continued as a tenant. The Licensing Act 1737 was modified by the Theatres Act 1843 so that spoken drama could be performed in any theatre. In November 1843 the Wisbech Theatre was again put up for auction \"in an excellent condition\". In 1845 Joseph Richardson's Rock Band gave morning and evening concerts with their lithophone. Star appearances at Wisbech and the rest of the Lincoln theatre circuit in spring 1845, for which the theatres charged premium prices, were Charles Kean and his wife Kate Terry; her roles included Miss Halley in The Stranger and a role in The Honey Moon.
