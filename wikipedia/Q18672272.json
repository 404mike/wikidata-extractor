Lady Raglan\u2014following an interpretive framework influenced by James Frazer and Margaret Murray\u2014suggested that it was a survival of a pre-Christian fertility ritual. Although this became the standard interpretation in the mid-twentieth century, it was rejected by folklorists and historians following the 1979 publication of Roy Judge's study on the custom, which outlined its historical development in the eighteenth century.", "Jack in the Green emerged within the context of English May Day processions, with the folklorist Roy Judge noting that these celebrations were not \"a set, immutable pattern, but rather a fluid, moving process, which combined different elements at various times\". Judge thought it unlikely that the Jack in the Green itself existed much before 1770, due to an absence of either the name or the structure itself in any of the written accounts of visual depictions of English May Day processions from before that year.", "This interpretation would be rejected by folklorists after the 1979 publication of a historical study on the Jack in the Green tradition written by the folklorist Roy Judge and published by the Folklore Society. This monograph had been based on Judge's doctoral research, carried out at the University of Leeds' Folklife Studies Institute. Hutton described Judge's book as \"a turning-point in folklore studies which showed how much could be learned from a systematic investigation of historical evidence\". It was, in his view, \"one of the first triumphs\" of a movement within British folkloristics that sought \"to reintroduce a scholarly rigour to their field\". Writing Judge's obituary for The Guardian, Derek Schofield stated that Judge's book \"set new standards of meticulous research in a discipline that has frequently attracted shoddy and fanciful scholarship\"."]}, {"page": "London Pride", "response": ["* London Pride Morris Men, founded in the 1930s, one of the earliest sides of the Morris Men dance revival, whose membership included Roy Judge"]}, {"page": "English Folk Dance and Song Society", "response": ["* 1999  Roy Judge; Ron Smedley"]}, {"page": "The Folklore Society", "response": ["* 1990\u201393 Roy Judge ", "* 2000 Professor John Widdowson and Dr Roy Judge"]}]}}
