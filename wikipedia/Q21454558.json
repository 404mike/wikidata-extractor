The range of his work included a variety of cartoons: sports, topical, and strip cartoons. He also produced animated cartoons, and provided material for children's books and boys' weeklies. Later in life he also became a painter.His father was a conductor of theatre orchestras who encouraged Roland's interest in art. The family moved to Ipswich where Roland attended the Ipswich School of Art. After serving an apprenticeship as a lithographer, Roland started freelancing for such magazines as The Autocar and The Motor Cycle. However, when The Modern Boy was launched in 1928 he received regular work providing illustrations for covers and adventure stories.Davies established the Roland Davies Cartoon Film Company Limited, which was dissolved in 1939.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Beano", "response": ["Overseeing the magazines was the Managing Editor of Children's Publications, R. D. Low, who first joined the company in 1913. Almost a decade into the big five's success, the stories shifted to comedic and included more comic strips, which gave Low an idea of creating a new \"big five\" which focused on the funnies more than drama. The suggestion was approved; editors Bill Blain and (sub-editor) Albert Barnes of The Wizard and The Hotspur, respectively, joined Low's project. The new team placed a newspaper advertisement into The Daily Telegraph asking for artists and/or comic ideas. With the help of the advertisement responses and employed artists at DC Thomson, The Dandy was published in 1937, the New Big Five's first member. For The Beano (initially called \"The Beano Comic\" until issue 412), Low received comic strip suggestions by Reg Carter, an English illustrator in Sussex who had created funnies for several British comics and designed humorous postcards. After an in-person interview, Low and Carter planned the front cover for The Beano first issue, eventually creating the character Big Eggo (originally named Oswald the Ostrich). It would be in colour whilst the inside of the magazine would be black and white, a tactic used for The Dandy first issue (black and white stories inside, colourful Korky the Cat strip on the front). Joining the Big Eggo strip would be many funnies, such as Hugh McNeill's Ping the Elastic Man, James Jewell's Wee Peem, Allan Morley's Big Fat Joe, Eric Roberts' Rip Van Wink, Dudley D. Watkins' Lord Snooty and His Pals, and Roland Davies' Contrary Mary. Despite the aim to make a new comic series full of American-inspired comic strips, The Beano also contained short stories, serial fiction and adventure stories similar to the Big Five's magazines; Morgyn the Mighty was previously in The Rover. Tin-Can Tommy and Brave Captain Kipper were reprints, co-produced by the Italian art agency Torelli Bros."]}, {"page": "Knockout (UK comics)", "response": ["The first series, titled Knockout Comics, was launched by editor Percy Clarke and sub-editor Leonard Matthews in 1939 to compete with The Dandy and The Beano (launched by DC Thomson in 1937 and 1938 respectively).

He was nicknamed \"Karlo\", later shortened to \"Carl\", by friends who decided he looked like Boris Karloff, a lifelong nickname. He was actually registered with that name when he died in 1995. After leaving school at the age of 14 he worked as an office boy for Superads, an advertising agency that commissioned animated films from cartoonists like Brian White and Sid Griffiths' animation company also based in Charing Cross Road, London from 1929. When Superads closed in 1931, he gained experience in other small film companies in the area before being promoted to an animator in 1935, beginning to work for producer Alexander Korda on a colour cartoon film, The Fox Hunt. Giles then went to Ipswich to join Roland Davies, who was setting up a studio to produce animated versions of his popular newspaper strip \"Come On Steve\". Six ten-minute films were produced, beginning with Steve Steps Out (1936), but even though Giles was the head animator, he received no screen credit."]}, {"page": "List of Beano comic strips", "response": ["| Roland Davies", "| Roland Davies", "| Roland Davies"]}, {"page": "Roland Davies", "response": ["Roland Davies may refer to:", "*Roland Davies (actor) in No Commitments", "*Roland Davies (comics), writer for Knockout"]}, {"page": "School Friend", "response": ["Frank Redpath, later to become known as a poet, wrote scripts for the strip Lucky's Living Doll (later known as Lucky and Tina).
