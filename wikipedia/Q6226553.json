He spent thirty years in Argentina (1857\u20131887), during which he was in charge of several public works including Mitre Railway's extension.\nIn 1859 he proposed improvements for the Buenos Aires harbour, taking into account the streams, silting and other characteristics of the R\u00edo de la Plata. In 1869 he carried out hypsometric studies of the core of the city and its drainage capability in relation to flooding.\nHe was also involved in the Argentine railway system, extending the railway lines from Azul to Bah\u00eda Blanca during his term as chairman of the Gran Ferrocarril Sur Company, and from Campana to Rosario as chairman of the Ferrocarril de Buenos Aires a Campana Company.\nHe died in England in 1890. Argentine railway authorities gave his name to one of their railway stations a year after his death. What is now the barrio (neighbourhood) of Coghlan in Buenos Aires developed around the station named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1890 in Ireland", "response": ["*:*John Coghlan, public works engineer in Argentina (born 1824)."]}, {"page": "Coghlan, Buenos Aires", "response": ["The 1887 sale of 30 hectares (75 acres) of land to the Mitre Railway led to the railway's extension under the direction of Irish Argentine engineer John Coghlan, in whose honor the train station was named.

In 1869, the English engineer John F. La Trobe Bateman had presented a project of running water, sewers and drains, which enhanced a previous proposal of the engineer John Coghlan. These were put into practice and in 1874 Batement started construction of the network, which by 1880 provided water to a quarter of the city. In 1873 he started construction of the sewage works.  In 1875, the collection of waste was centralised with the creation of rubbish dumps. Until then, most people had just thrown all their waste into ditches and streams."]}]}}
