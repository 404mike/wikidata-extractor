He played professionally for a number of clubs, but the peak of his career was spent with Birmingham City during their most successful period in the 1950s. Over a professional career of nearly 400 appearances in the Football League, he scored at a rate of very nearly one goal every two games.

Although he suffered from a case of appendicitis during the year, he scored 14 times in 23 matches, including hat-tricks against Doncaster Rovers and Fulham. In October 1953, having been plagued by knee problems, Dudley moved to the First Division for the first time in his career, joining Cardiff City in exchange for Bobby McLaughlin. He made his debut for the Bluebirds on 24 October 1953 during a 3\u20130 defeat to Burnley but made just four further appearances for the club, scoring once during a 5\u20130 victory over Charlton Athletic, as a persistent knee injury and the signing of Welsh international Trevor Ford saw him unable to break into the first-team.

In the fourth round, Leyton Orient, who had beaten Birmingham at the same stage four years earlier, posed more of a potential problem. In reality the win was equally comfortable: Eddy Brown added two goals to his hat-trick at Torquay. A tight local derby game followed on a snow-covered frozen pitch at The Hawthorns. In the first half, goalkeeper Gil Merrick and his defence did well to keep West Bromwich Albion out; Trevor Smith had to clear a Ronnie Allen header from under the crossbar.
