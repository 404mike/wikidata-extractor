The massive walls of Byllis were built before the end of the 4th century, and literary sources report them as an Illyrian rather than Epirote or Macedonian foundation. Later Byllis acquired the trappings of a Hellenistic town, and because the southernmost Illyrian tribes, including the Bylliones, were inclined to become bilingual, it was also a Greek-speaking city. On the other hand, the citizens of Byllis were called Byllideis (). Byllis received sacred ancient Greek Ienvoys, known as theoroi during the early 2nd century BC, which seems to indicate that it was a Ancient Greek city, or that its inhabitants had become Greek-speaking.Peter Allan Hansen.

Stephanie West argues that there was a pre-existing body of poetry which dealt with Nestor's heroic exploits in his youth, and which told of Nestor's cup.  Peter Allan Hansen suggests that the cup may have appeared in the Cypria, perhaps in the episode known from a citation in Athenaeus where Nestor gives Menelaus counsel after the abduction of Helen."]}]}}
