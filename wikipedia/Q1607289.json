In his personal library were two editions of Scapula's 1579 abridgement of Henricus Stephanus' Thesaurus Graecae Linguae, which listed \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\" as the name for \"diagnostics,\"\"Semiotics.\" Oxford English Dictionary (1989).

He notably writes both (a) \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\" and (b) \"\u03a3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\": when term (a) is followed by any kind of punctuation mark, it takes the form (b).  In Chapter XX, titled \"Division of the Sciences,\" which concludes the 1st edition of Locke's Essay (1689/1690), Locke introduces \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\"  in \u00a7\u00a04 as his proposed name synonymous with \"the Doctrine of Signs\" for the development of the future study of the ubiquitous role of signs within human awareness. In the 4th edition of Locke's Essay (1700), a new Chapter XIX, titled \"Of Enthusiasm,\" is inserted into Book IV. As result, Chapter XX of the 1st edition becomes Chapter XXI for all subsequent editions. It is an important fact that Locke's proposal for the development of semiotics, with three passing exceptions as \"asides\" in the writings of Berkeley, Leibniz, and Condillac, \"is met with a resounding silence that lasts as long as modernity itself. Even Locke's devoted late modern editor, Alexander Campbell Fraser, dismisses out of hand 'this crude and superficial scheme of Locke'\" Deely adds \"Locke's modest proposal subversive of the way of ideas, its reception, and its bearing on the resolution of an ancient and a modern controversy in logic.\" In the Oxford University Press critical edition (1975), prepared and introduced by Peter Harold Nidditch, Nidditch tells us, in his \"Foreword,\" that he presents us with \"a complete, critically established, and unmodernized text that aims at being historically faithful to Locke's final intentions\"; that \"the present text is based on the original fourth edition of the Essay; and that \"readings in the other early authorized editions are adopted, in appropriate form, where necessary, and recorded otherwise in the textual notes.\" The term \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\" appears in that 4th edition (1700), the last published (but not the last prepared) within Locke's lifetime, with exactly the spelling and final accent found in the 1st edition. Yet if we turn to (the final) chapter XXI of the Oxford edition (1975, p. 720), we find not \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\" but rather do we find substituted the \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\" spelling (and with final accent reversed).

In A Praefatory Answer to Mr. Henry Stubbe (1671) he defined the \"philosophy of the virtuosi\" cleanly: the \"plain objects of sense\" to be respected, as the locus of as much certainty as was available; the \"suspension of assent\" absent adequate proof; and the claim for the approach as \"equally an adversary to scepticism and credulity\".

Montagu, along with many others, including the freethinking scholar Henry Stubbe, celebrated Islam for what they saw as its rational approach to theology, for its strict monotheism, and for its teaching and practice around religious tolerance. In short, Montagu and other thinkers in this tradition saw Islam as a source of Enlightenment, as evidenced in her calling the Qur'an \"the purest morality delivered in the very best language\" By comparison, Montagu dedicated large portions of the Turkish Embassy Letters to criticizing Catholic religious practices, particularly Catholic beliefs around sainthood, miracles, and religious relics, which she frequently excoriated.
