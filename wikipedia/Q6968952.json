In preparation for the 2016\u201317 campaign, Flitcroft released six players and brought in a number of new signings, including: Antony Kay, Greg Leigh, Leon Barnett, Neil Danns, Paul Rachubka, Chris Brown and James Vaughan. Flitcroft was named as League One Manager of the Month for September 2016 after overseeing five wins from five games that the League Managers Association described as \"guided by Flitcroft\u2019s beliefs in attacking play and some shrewd moves at the end of the transfer window\". On 16 November, Flitcroft was sacked after a run of 11 games without a win that coincided with a series of injuries to first-team players such as Tom Pope, Danny Mayor and Nathan Cameron. Gareth Southgate's promotion to England manager left a vacancy for the head coach role of the under-21 team and Flitcroft applied for the position, making into the final four of the interview process, though the job instead went to Aidy Boothroyd."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["*16 \u2013 Callum Wilson, Nathan Cameron, Michael Quirke and Shaun Jeffers are offered their first professional contracts.", "*21 \u2013 Defender Nathan Cameron signs his first professional contract, a one-year deal running until June 2011.", "| Nathan Cameron", "| Nathan Cameron || Nuneaton Town || 1 April 2010 || 5 May 2010"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["* 7 \u2013 Jordan Clarke and Nathan Cameron are called up to the England Under-20 squad for the first time for the match against France Under-20.", "* 10 \u2013 Jordan Clarke and Nathan Cameron win their first caps for England Under-20 in a friendly against France Under-20.", "| Nathan Cameron"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["*27 \u2013 Defender Nathan Cameron signs a new two-year contract extension running until June 2013.", "| Nathan Cameron"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["| Nathan Cameron", "| 5 ||  || DF || Nathan Cameron || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "| Nathan Cameron ||  Northampton Town || 26 March 2013 || 30 June 2013"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 15 || CB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Nathan Cameron", "| 26 March 2013 || CB ||  || Nathan Cameron || Coventry City || 30 June 2013 || "]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["|  Nathan Cameron ||  Bury || 28 June 2013 || Free"]}, {"page": "2013 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Neither side made any changes to their personnel during half-time.
