The 8th Division plan was to attack with all three brigades against the Ovillers Spur, which dominates the ground north of the Albert\u2013Bapaume road. The centre brigade would benefit from a covered approach until the last  up to the village but the flanking brigades would have to advance up the re-entrants of Mash Valley to the south and Nab Valley to the north, exposed on flat ground without cover to the German garrisons in La Boisselle and the Leipzig salient. Hudson asked for the divisional zero hour to be postponed slightly so that the 34th Division to the south and the 32nd Division to the north would have engaged these positions before the infantry advanced. Rawlinson rejected the request but put a battery of the 32nd Division artillery at the disposal of the 8th Division (Major-General Havelock Hudson) to suppress enfilade fire. The 23rd Brigade (Brigadier-General H. D. Tuson attack would be up Mash Valley, with the right flank to gain the Albert\u2013Bapaume road south of Ovillers. The brigade was then to advance  up the road to Pozi\u00e8res. The 25th Brigade (Brigadier-General J. H. W. Pollard) was to capture Ovillers and the 70th Brigade (Brigadier-General H. Gordon) was to attack the south slope of Nab Valley to the north of Ovillers and then forward to the German second position north of Pozi\u00e8res, left to Mouquet Farm."]}, {"page": "General Hudson", "response": ["*Havelock Hudson (1862\u20131944), British Indian Army general"]}]}}
