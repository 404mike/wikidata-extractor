After maintaining the existing editorial leadership for a couple of years, in 1908 Northcliffe named James Louis Garvin as editor. Garvin quickly turned the paper into an organ of political influence, boosting circulation from 5,000 to 40,000 within a year of his arrival as a result. Yet the revival in the paper's fortunes masked growing political disagreements between Garvin and Northcliffe. These disagreements ultimately led Northcliffe to sell the paper to William Waldorf Astor in 1911, who transferred ownership to his son Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor four years later."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: A", "response": ["* Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor (1910\u20131919)"]}, {"page": "Viscount Astor", "response": ["*Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor (1879\u20131952)"]}, {"page": "Astor family", "response": ["** 15px The Right Hon.
