He served national service in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.Tulloch started as an apprentice baker with his brother-in-law and remained in the trade until 1964, when after meeting George Waterston of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), he was appointed as RSPB warden in Shetland. He was especially associated with the snowy owls that started breeding on the island of Fetlar in 1967. He featured in a number of BBC Natural History Unit programmes, including a personal recounting of his discovery of the snow owls nesting on Fetlar, originally broadcast in 1974 on the BBC Radio 4 programme The Living World and rebroadcast by Lindsey Chapman in 2019.Bobby Tulloch was an artist, boatman, musician, naturalist, photographer, storyteller and writer. In 1994, he was awarded an MBE. He was nicknamed \"Tucker\" by his friends. He has been described as one of Shetland's \"greatest-ever ambassadors\". A book of reminiscences about Bobby Tulloch, Bobby the Birdman, was published in 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Snowy owl", "response": ["Between 1967 and 1975, snowy owls bred on the remote island of Fetlar in the Shetland Isles north of mainland Scotland, discovered by the Shetland RSPB warden, Bobby Tulloch. Females summered as recently as 1993, but their status in the British Isles is now that of a rare winter visitor to Shetland, the Outer Hebrides and the Cairngorms.\"Hope of first owl chicks in years\", BBC News. 13 May 2008. Older records show that the snowy owls may have once semi-regularly bred elsewhere in the Shetlands. They range in northern Greenland (mostly Peary Land) and, rarely in \"isolated parts of the highlands\", Iceland. Thence, they are found breeding at times across northern Eurasia such as in Spitsbergen and western and northern Scandinavia. In Norway, they normally breed in Troms og Finnmark and seldom down as far south as Hardangervidda and in Sweden perhaps down to the Scandinavian Mountains while breeding is very inconsistent in Finland.Saurola, P.
