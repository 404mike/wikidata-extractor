After his education in the village school he worked alongside his father as a wheat farmer. Following his father's death in a farming accident, the family relocated to Wroughton where Elizabeth, assisted by William and his two elder brothers, took up tenancy of Artis Farm.\nIn 1908, Gosling enlisted with the Territorial Force. At the age of 18 he emigrated to Canada, where he worked on grain silos before becoming a fireman on the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, he paid for his passage home and enlisted with the 3rd Wessex Brigade, Royal Field Artillery. He departed for France on 6 May 1915 where his battalion was attached to the 51st Highland Division, stationed near Arras.\nDuring the precursor bombardment to the Battle of Arras, on 5 April 1917 Gosling was a battery sergeant in charge of several heavy trench mortars. A bomb was fired from a Stokes Mortar of Sergeant Gosling's battery. \"Owing to a faulty cartridge the bomb, after discharge, fell 10 yards from the mortar. Sergeant Gosling sprang out, lifted the nose of the bomb which had sunk into the ground, unscrewed the fuse and threw it on the ground, where it immediately exploded. This very gallant and prompt action undoubtedly saved the lives of the whole detachment\".  For this action he was awarded the Victoria Cross and was presented with the award by King George V outside Buckingham Palace on  21 July 1917.\nAfter the war, Gosling returned to his home village of Wroughton to take up the tenancy of Summerhouse Farm. He was vice-president of the Wroughton branch of the Royal British Legion and served as a Parish Councillor for 14 years between 1922 and 1936.  During World War II, the decorated war hero served as a major in the Home Guard.\nGosling managed and worked his dairy farm in Wroughton for the remainder of his life. He died at his home on 12 February 1945, aged 52. He is buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist & St Helen's parish church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "51st (Highland) Division", "response": ["* Sergeant William Gosling, Royal Field Artillery, 3rd Wessex Brigade"]}, {"page": "Wroughton", "response": ["*William Gosling (VC) (1892\u20131945), recipient of the Victoria Cross in 1917, farmer at Wroughton"]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|William Gosling ||  British Army || 1917 || First World War || Arras"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (W)", "response": ["# William Gosling (footballer)", "# William Gosling (VC)"]}, {"page": "Gosling (surname)", "response": ["*William Gosling (1892\u20131945), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*William Gosling (engineer) (born ca. 1930), British electrical engineer", "*William Gosling (footballer) (1869\u20131952), British footballer"]}, {"page": "William Gosling", "response": ["William Gosling may refer to:", "* William Gosling (engineer) (born ca. 1930), British electrical engineer", "* William Gosling (VC) (1892\u20131945), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* William Gosling (footballer) (1869\u20131952), British football player"]}]}}
