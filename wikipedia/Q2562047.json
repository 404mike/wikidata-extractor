He initially took an interest in African mammals and there was little material from India. He persuaded his friends in India to collect specimens and this led to a collaborative mammal survey in 1911. Interest in small mammals was also raised by work on plague particularly due to the work of Captain Glen Liston who delivered a special address to the members of the BNHS. Collectors for the small mammal survey included C. A. Crump (Khandesh, Darjeeling), Sir Ernest Hotson (Baluchistan), R. Shunkara Narayan Pillay (Travancore), J. M. D. Mackenzie (Burma), Captain Philip Gosse (Poona, Nilgiris), S. H. Prater (Satara), Charles McCann and others and the survey went on until 1923. It is believed to be the first collaborative biodiversity study in the world. The project accumulated 50,000 specimens over 12 years, especially of the smaller mammals and the information was published in 47 papers. Wroughton was also helped by his brother-in-law T. B. Fry who continued to work after his death in 1921. Several new species were discovered in the process.\nNumerous species are named after him including\n\nWroughton's Free-tailed Bat (Otomops wroughtoni)\nMany ant species: (Aenictus wroughtonii, Camponotus wroughtonii, Cardiocondyla wroughtonii, Carebara wroughtonii, Chronoxenus wroughtonii, Crematogaster wroughtonii, Hypoponera confinis wroughtonii, Lepisiota rothneyi wroughtonii, Monomorium wroughtoni, Monomorium wroughtonianum, Pheidole wroughtonii, Platythrea wroughtonii, Polyrhachis wroughtonii, Rhoptromyrmex wroughtonii, Tapinoma wroughtonii, Temnothorax wroughtonii)\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Large Indian civet", "response": ["*V. z. picta described by Robert Charles Wroughton in 1915 was based on two skins from the vicinity of Hkamti by the upper Chindwin River in Myanmar; occurs from Assam and northern Myanmar to Indochina."]}, {"page": "R.C.

British zoologist Oldfield Thomas named the Tasmanian long-eared bat (Nyctophilus sherrini) after him. Of Sherrin, Thomas wrote, \"every mammalogist who has visited the Museum is indebted [to him] for assistance . . . [his] admirable preparation of tiny skulls and tinier bacula has so immensely helped in the mammalian work done both by staff and visitors.\" Robert Charles Wroughton named a species of gerbil after him, Tatera sherrini, in 1917, saying that Sherrin \"has given such invaluable assistance in organising the storage of the Survey material.\" However, T. sherrini has since been recognized as a synonym of Tatera indica."]}]}}
