Australia, led by Don Bradman, won by seven wickets. Godfrey Evans said the England team was complacent because no one had ever achieved such a target before in Test cricket. Evans himself was a prime culprit because he missed stumping chances, including one off Laker with Bradman beaten and out of his ground. Bradman later said that it was the key moment of the Australian innings. In the match as a whole, Laker bowled 62 overs and took three wickets for 206 runs. The situation was well summarised by Playfair saying that England needed \"a leg-spinner or a Verity\" (Hedley Verity was a slow left arm orthodox bowler) but they had neither. The implication was that the pitch was not one on which an off-break bowler such as Laker could succeed. Playfair went on to criticise \"tactical errors, missed chances and a sad lethargy in the field\".Playfair 1949, p. 58. ", "The 1958 season was the last of Surrey's seven consecutive County Championships but it was marred by a quarrel between Laker and the team captain Peter May, who had accused Laker of \"not trying\" in a match against Kent at Blackheath in July. Kent won the match by 29 runs. Laker bowled a total of 54 overs in the match and that immediately followed a haul of 63 overs in a match against Glamorgan at Swansea, which Surrey won. It seems that Laker's spinning finger was definitely suffering from \"wear and tear\" at the time and this probably reduced his effectiveness. His colleagues held differing views about the matter. Peter Loader said May was completely out of order while Micky Stewart suggested that May should have been aware that \"Jim was knackered\". Godfrey Evans, who played for Kent in the match, said that Laker was \"ill-supported by May\". Raman Subba Row blamed May for his \"management style\" which was not at all people-oriented, unlike that of Stuart Surridge, May's predecessor as Surrey captain, who was a \"people person\" and \"down to earth\". On the other hand, Arthur McIntyre blamed Laker for his batting in the Kent match because he \"holed out\" and made a more general comment about Laker \"crying wolf\" over injuries to his fingers."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket records", "response": ["|  Godfrey Evans || style=\"text-align:center;\"|91"]}, {"page": "Wicket-keeper", "response": ["A keeper's position depends on the bowler: for fast bowling he will squat some distance from the stumps, in order to have time to react to edges from the batsman, while for slower bowling, he will come much nearer to the stumps (known as \"standing up\"), to pressure the batsman into remaining within the crease or risk being stumped.

Before the team left England, critics queried his appointment, arguing that a professional captain was unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton's authority was also compromised by the MCC, who did not give him the tour manager he requested;Gibson, pp. 185\u201386. instead, they appointed the inexperienced Charles Palmer, the Leicestershire captain, who had already been selected as a player on the tour.Swanton, p. 148. Palmer's dual role as player and manager blurred the lines of command.Howat, pp. 140\u201341. Hutton also found some of the professionals in the team to be difficult to lead, particularly Godfrey Evans,Gibson, p. 186. and Fred Trueman.Howat, p. 140. Off-field events often overshadowed the cricket. Amid growing independence movements in the region, Hutton believed his team was used as a political instrument to support colonial rule.Howat, pp. 125\u201326. The situation was further inflamed as journalists and English residents in the Caribbean placed great emphasis on an English victory, and the perception was that the series would establish the unofficial world champions. The standards of local umpiring were a further source of controversy. The crowds often made noisy protests about on-field events, often related to umpiring. The climax came in the third Test when missiles were thrown onto the outfield when the umpire judged Cliff McWatt was out; Hutton kept his team and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation.Gibson, p. 185.Howat, p. 131. The attitude of some English players inflamed feelings, either through a perceived lack of courtesy,Howat, pp. 129, 137\u201338. or their negative reactions to events on the field. Some critics held Hutton responsible for this,Howat, pp. 129\u201330, 140. but the editor of Wisden later wrote: \"[Hutton] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling\u2014an experience all of them wish to forget.

He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner.Bowes, p. 191. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball.Gibson, pp. 188\u201389. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long.Bowes, pp. 191\u201392.

Wisden said that \"by whatever standard he is judged\", Lindwall must \"be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers\", attributing his success to \"superb control of length and direction, his change of pace and general skill, the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning\". The ferocity of Lindwall's bouncer often prompted opposing batsmen to retreat onto the back foot even before he had released the ball.

In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.pp22-26, pp214-228, Fingletonp402, Colin Frith, Pageant of Cricket, Macmillan Company of Australia, 1987pp9-12, O'Reilly", "England failed to match the Australians' high standards of fielding and were nicknamed Brown's Cows by the Australian barrackers.p10, Freddi They dropped six catches in a match against Victoria and made frequent mistakes in the state matches.
