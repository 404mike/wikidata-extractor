With semifinal ties traditionally played at a neutral venue, the match was held at Meadow Lane, the home ground of Notts County, attracting a relatively low crowd of 20,000. Cardiff made a last minute change when Len Davies was replaced by Nicholson in the starting line-up and it was Nicholson who opened the scoring after just six minutes when he headed in after a goalmouth scramble from a corner. Gill and Beadles added two further goals after mistakes in the Blackburn defence to give their side an unassailable lead. Blackburn scored a late consolation goal through John McKay but were unable to breach the Cardiff defence again despite sustained pressure. By defeating Blackburn, Cardiff became the first Welsh club to reach an FA Cup final and the first non-English team to do so since Scottish side Queens Park in 1885. Despite recovering from injury, Len Davies was left out of the side with Nicholson keeping his place. Around 92,000 spectators attended the final against Sheffield United at Wembley Stadium with the match dubbed \"The Jubilee Final\" as the 50th final in the competition's history. The match was deemed to be low on quality with The Times reporting that more than two-thirds of the final were \"never first-class.\" The decisive moment of the match came on the half hour mark when Cardiff half-back Harry Wake gave possession away cheaply to opposition forward Fred Tunstall who scored the only goal of the game. Fred Keenor later described the build up to the winning goal, commenting \"Wake was in possession of the ball and was facing his own goal when he turned to make a clearance. Tunstall, sizing up the position much quicker than any of our defence, raced in, robbed Wake on the turn, and after advancing about 10 yards shot into the corner of the net.\" Keenor though absolved his teammate of any blame in conceding the goal, adding \"Any blame must be shouldered by the rest of the defence, of which I was one. A warning shout should have been given of Tunstall's first approach.\""]}]}}
