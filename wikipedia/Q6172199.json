She made her motion picture debut in 1931 and went on to perform and star in more than twenty films. Her West End stage appearances included Walter C. Hackett's Road House (1932), Afterwards (1933) and Espionage (1935). In 1945 she appeared in the hit musical Under the Counter alongside Cicely Courtneidge.\nShe was married in 1933 to businessman Bernard Docker but their union lasted only a few months. Docker's disapproving father had her followed by private detectives; on discovering her association with actor David Hutcheson, allegedly involving 'circumstances which left no doubt of their adultery', Docker divorced her.After World War II, she moved to the United States, taking up residence on Long Island. She met Baron Eug\u00e8ne Daniel von Rothschild, a member of the Rothschild family and grandson of Salomon Mayer von Rothschild of the Rothschild banking family of Austria. They married in 1952, after which she gave up her acting career. For a time, she and her husband lived in New York City and Long Island but eventually made their permanent home in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\nBaroness Jeanne de Rothschild died in Monte Carlo in 2003.", "link_mentions": {}}}
