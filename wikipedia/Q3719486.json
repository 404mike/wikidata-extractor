Turges also has a Magnificat extant in the Caius Choirbook, and compositions in the Fayrfax Boke. A Kyrie and Gloria are ascribed to Sturges in the Ritson Manuscript. At least two masses and three Magnificat settings have been lost, as well as eight six-part pieces listed in the 1529 King's College Inventory.It is quite possible that his setting of 'Gaude flore virginali' was written with the choir of New College, Oxford in mind, especially since a man by the name of Sturges served as a chaplain in the choir between 1507-08. Its unorthodox vocal scoring for TrTrATB suggests the choral forces found in the college at the time where the boys (16 in total) outnumbered the men (of whom there were likely to have been no more than four).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["|Edmund Turges possibly the same as Edmund Sturges || 1450 || 1500 || Has a number of works preserved in the Eton Choirbook; at least three Magnificat settings and two masses have been lost."]}, {"page": "Eton Choirbook", "response": ["* 51.  f. 85v-87: Gaude flore virginali - Edmund Turges", "* 64.  f. 103v-105: Gaude flore virginali - Edmund Turges", "* 84.  missing: Magnificat: Et exultavit spiritus meus - Edmund Turges", "* 85.  missing: Magnificat: Et exultavit spiritus meus - Edmund Turges", "* 89.  missing: Magnificat: Et exultavit spiritus meus - Edmund Turges", "The composers represented in the manuscript are: John Browne (10 works), Richard Davy (9), Walter Lambe (8), Robert Wilkinson (7), William Cornysh (5), William Horwood (4), Robert Fayrfax (2), John Fawkyner (2), Nicholas Huchyn (2), Hugh Kellyk (2), Edmund Turges (2), Gilbert Banester, Brygeman (1), Robert Hacomplaynt (1), John Hampton (1), Holynborne (1), Richard Hygons (1), Nesbet (1), Edmund Sturton (1), John Sutton (1), Sygar (1) and William Stratford (1)."]}, {"page": "Caius Choirbook", "response": ["The major contributors to the Caius Choirbook are Robert Fayrfax and Nicholas Ludford; between them they contributed at least eleven of its fifteen pieces.

It is highly likely that two of the three English choirbooks that survive from the early Tudor period originated in Sussex.

The Arundel choirbook contains works by several composers including Walter Lambe, a former lay clerk at Arundel. The Caius choirbook includes work by Edmund Turges.
