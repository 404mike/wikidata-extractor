In the mid-19th century golf was played mainly by well-off gentlemen, as hand-crafted clubs and balls were expensive. Professionals made a living from playing for bets, caddying, ball and club making, and instruction. Allan Robertson was the most famous of these pros, and was regarded as the undisputed best golfer between 1843 and his death in 1859. James Ogilvie Fairlie of Prestwick Golf Club decided to form a competition in 1860, \"to be played for by professional golfers\", and to decide who would succeed Robertson as the \"Champion Golfer\". Blackheath (England), Perth, Bruntsfield (Edinburgh), Musselburgh and St Andrews golf clubs were invited to send up to three of their best players known as a \"respectable caddie\" to represent each of the clubs. The winner received the Challenge Belt, made from red leather with a silver buckle and worth \u00a325, which came about thanks to being donated by the Earl of Eglinton, a man with a keen interest in medieval pageantry (belts were the type of trophy that might have been competed for in archery or jousting)."]}, {"page": "World Golf Hall of Fame", "response": ["*2001  Allan Robertson"]}, {"page": "Timeline of golf history (1851\u20131945)", "response": ["Allan Robertson becomes the first golfer to break 80 at the Old Course, recording a 79.", "Death of Allan Robertson, the first great professional golfer."]}, {"page": "Old Tom Morris", "response": ["Morris was the son of a weaver, and was educated at Madras College in his home town.

Finegan, 2010 The opening of the coastal railway from Dundee to Arbroath in 1838 brought an influx of golfers from as far afield as Edinburgh, anxious to tackle the ancient links. This led to a complete restructuring of the course, extended in 1867 by Old Tom Morris to the 18 holes which had meanwhile become standardized.
