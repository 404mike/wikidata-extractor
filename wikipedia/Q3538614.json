Wishart has contributed to composing with digital audio media, both fixed and interactive. He has also written extensively on the topic of what he terms \"sonic art\", and contributed to the design and implementation of software tools used in the creation of digital music; notably, the Composers Desktop Project.\nWishart was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire. He was educated at the University of Oxford (BA 1968), the University of Nottingham (MA 1969), and the University of York (PhD 1973).  Although mainly a freelance composer, he holds an honorary position at the University of York. He was appointed as composer-in-residence at the University of Durham in 2006, and then at the University of Oxford Faculty of Music in 2010\u201311, supported by the Leverhulme Trust.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ladislav Kupkovi\u010d", "response": ["Kupkovi\u010d has probably become best known for his experiments with the concert form in the 1970s. In Musik f\u00fcr das Ruhrfestspielhaus (1970), he arranged forty performers to play a number of pieces in a concert hall in Recklinghausen over the course of three hours. The pieces were played in various parts of the building, some of them at the same time. Kupkovi\u010d called this kind of concert a Wandelkonzert (meaning \"walking concert\"), and Wandelkonzerte have often invited comparisons to John Cage's Musicircus events. The idea was expanded for Klanginvasion auf Bonn (1971), for which 150 musicians played at various venues in Bonn over the course of twelve hours.
