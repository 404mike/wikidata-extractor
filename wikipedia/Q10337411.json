He was born in Newburn, Newcastle upon Tyne, England.During his playing career he played for sides including Huddersfield Town and Sheffield Wednesday.\nStan Seymour appointed Smith as his assistant at Newcastle United in 1939 and he helped contribute to the club's success in the 1950s. The loyalty he had shown by staying at the club for twenty-two years was rewarded in 1961 when he was appointed the new manager of the club, following Charlie Mitten's sacking. While he only won twelve games out of thirty-five during his period in charge, this was enough to stave off relegation to the Third Division, which had looked a distinct possibility when Mitten was sacked, and he still had the respect of the fans for staying with the club for so long and showing a passion for the club. He stepped down as manager at the end of the season and was succeeded by Joe Harvey, though Smith remained at the club in various other capacities for several more years.\nSmith died suddenly in 1978, while on his way home from Newcastle's stadium St James' Park after watching the team play.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newburn", "response": ["*Norman Smith, professional footballer for Charlton Athletic and Queens Park Rangers", "*Norman Smith, professional footballer for Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Queens Park Rangers.

The \"Magpies\" suffered relegation out of the First Division in 1960\u201361 under Charlie Mitten. However, because of his no nonsense attitude and uncompromising style as a defender, McGrath soon became a real favourite with the \"Toon Army\". A disappointing eleventh-place finish in the Second Division followed in 1961\u201362, and Joe Harvey took over from Norman Smith in the management hotseat. Seventh- and eighth-place finishes followed in 1962\u201363 and 1963\u201364, before United were crowned champions of the Second Division in 1964\u201365, a single point ahead of second placed Northampton Town. They settled into the top-flight with a 15th-place finish in 1965\u201366, though they only avoided relegation by one place and four points in 1966\u201367. They then rallied to a tenth-place finish in 1967\u201368. Overall, McGrath played 179 league and cup games for the Geordies, scoring two goals, before making the long trip to Southampton in February 1968 for \u00a330,000."]}]}}
