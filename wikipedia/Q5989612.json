Brentford's sustained period of success was consolidated by Curtis' man-management abilities and his astuteness in the transfer market, bringing in Scottish internationals Dave McCulloch, Bobby Reid and Duncan McKenzie, Welsh internationals Idris Hopkins and Les Boulter, with Billy Scott and Les Smith going on to represent England."]}, {"page": "Bill Berry (footballer, born 1904)", "response": ["In November 1932, Berry joined Third Division South club Crystal Palace in a part-exchange deal which saw Idris Hopkins move to Brentford. In what remained of the 1932\u201333 season, Berry scored four goals in 17 appearances, but in an unlucky twist, he lost his place to new signing Arthur Crompton, whose signing had cost him his place at Brentford a year earlier. He closed out his Football League career with a short spell at Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, before moving to France to join National club SC Fives in 1934, where he remained until his retirement as a player in 1937."]}, {"page": "Tom Sloan (footballer, born 1900)", "response": ["Sloan returned to management in December 1947 when he was appointed manager of Portadown for the third time. However, this proves to be his shortest spell with the club as he resigned his position three months later in February 1948. He later took up a coaching position at the club in 1950. Idris Hopkins briefly managed Portadown in 1952 before returning to England having failed to settle, resulting in Sloan being appointed manager for a fourth time in his place on a part-time basis. He remained in charge until January 1953, when Willie Ross was appointed on a permanent basis with Sloan reverting to his role as trainer. By the time he retired from football, Sloan had spent 30 years at Portadown in various capacities."]}, {"page": "Wales national football team results (1920\u20131939)", "response": ["|1934\u201335 British Home Championship|| Wilson Jones, Charlie Phillips, Idris Hopkins || 16,000", "|1938\u201339 British Home Championship|| Dai Astley (2), Bryn Jones, Idris Hopkins || 55,000"]}]}}
