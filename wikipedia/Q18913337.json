He received his medical education at St Bartholomew's Hospital, receiving there M.B. and B.Chir. in 1893 and D.P.H. in 1894.\nStephens held in 1895\u20131886 a Sir Trevor Lawrence research studentship in pathology and bacteriology at St Bartholomew's Hospital and in 1897 a John Lucas Walker research studentship in pathology at Cambridge. He became in 1897 an Assistant Bacteriologist to the Government of India. In 1898\u20131902 he was a member of the Royal Society's malaria commission in Africa and India. At Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine he was from 1903 to 1913 the Walter Myers Lecturer in Tropical Medicine and, as the successor to Sir Ronald Ross, from 1913 to 1928 the Alfred Jones Professor of Tropical Medicine. In World War I he was a malaria consultant with rank of  Lieutenant-Colonel, Royal Army Medical Corps. He was a member of the Colonial Medical Research Committee in 1927 and the president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1927\u20131928.\nStephens and H. B. Fantham did pioneering work on sleeping sickness and were the first to distinguish Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (although they called T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense by the names T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense, respectively \u2014 contrary to contemporary taxonomy).\nThere are several species of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans. One such species, namely Plasmodium ovale, was first described in 1914 by Stephens in a blood sample taken from a patient in Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh in the autumn of 1913.He married in 1901 and was the father of two sons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Stephens", "response": ["*John William Watson Stephens (1865\u20131946), British parasitologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|John William Watson Stephens||13/05/1920||2 March 1865 \u2013 17 May 1946"]}, {"page": "Manson Medal", "response": ["| 1935 || John William Watson Stephens, FRS"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1920", "response": ["*John William Watson Stephens"]}, {"page": "List of Indian Medical Service officers", "response": ["|John William Watson Stephens|| ||"]}]}}
