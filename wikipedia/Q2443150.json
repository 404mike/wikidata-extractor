He later received his PhD at the University of Cambridge in England on the subject which became his first major book, The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross. He served as warden of Tyndale House, Cambridge (1960\u201364); principal of Ridley College in Melbourne (1964-1979), Australia (where they have named a library in his honour); and Visiting Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.\nHe published several theological works and commentaries on the Bible, notable among which are The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross, The Atonement: Its Meaning and Significance, New Testament Theology, and The Gospel According to John (part of the New International Commentary on the New Testament series), The Gospel According to Matthew (IVP / Eerdmans, 1992), The Epistle to the Romans (IVP / Eerdmans, 1988), and The Book of Revelation: An Introduction and Commentary (Rev. ed., IVP / Eerdmans, 1987).\nIn 1974, a festschrift was published in his honour.

Indeed we can go further. There is not one example in the New Testament of the use of this verb where the resistance is successful. Always the drawing power is triumphant, as here.\" Such arguments invite the criticism that Calvinists teach salvation by decree of God rather than justification by faith alone, that they \"so zealously sought to guard the free grace of God in salvation that they denied faith any involvement at all in the actual justification of sinners.\" But even if the drawing power is always triumphant, the ability to resist does not depend upon the meaning of the word \"draw\" in John 12:32, but on the question what the \"draw\" is intended to accomplish. Calvinism assumes that persons who Jesus \"draws\" will be regenerated. Arminianism states that all are drawn to Jesus to be given an enabling grace. \"Jesus does not define what 'His drawing' will accomplish in John 12, only that He will do it.\" Even if the semantics of \"draw\" are understood in the manner Calvinist's urge, this should only be taken to indicate the sufficiency of the power to draw (they were \"not able to draw\" as in John 21:6, or they were able to do so as in John 21:11), rather than to define what God does to those He draws. Arminians reject the Calvinist teaching that God draws for the purpose of forced regeneration irrespective of their wishes. Rather Arminians believe God draws all persons to provide all with an ability or enabling to believe, as prevenient grace teaches."]}, {"page": "Chronology of Jesus", "response": ["Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the birth of Jesus: one based on the accounts in the Gospels of his birth with reference to King Herod's reign, and the other by subtracting his stated age of \"about 30\u00a0years\" when he began preaching. Most scholars, on this basis, assume a date of birth between 6 and 4\u00a0BC.John P. Meier (1991).

The debate can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the Last Supper takes place on the first night of Passover, defined in the Torah as occurring at twilight on 14 of Nisan, and the crucifixion is the following day on 15 Nisan. However, in the Gospel of John the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover mealPaul Barnett, Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times, page 21  (InterVarsity Press, 1999).  and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts, although Raymond E. Brown, reviewing these, concluded that they can not be easily reconciled.Death of the Messiah, Volume 2 by Raymond E. Brown 1999  pages 959\u2013960 One involves the suggestion that for Jesus and his disciples, the Passover could have begun at dawn Thursday, while for traditional Jews it would not have begun until dusk that same day. Another is that John followed the Roman practice of calculating the new day beginning at midnight, rather than the Jewish reckoning.Brooke Foss Westcott, The Gospel according to St. John : the authorised version with introduction and notes (1881, page 282). However, this Roman practice was used only for dating contracts and leases.Hunt, Michal. The Passover Feast and Christ's Passion 1991, revised 2007. Agape Bible Study.

Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan/Cambridge, U.K. 1995, pages 138 and 708. D. A. Carson argues that  'preparation of the Passover' could mean any day of the Passover week.D.A. Carson, 'The Gospel According to John', Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, 1991, p604 Some have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available.Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 Harmony of the Gospels  pages 323\u2013323New Testament History by Richard L. Niswonger 1992  pages 173\u2013174 Andreas K\u00f6stenberger argues that in the first century time was often estimated to the closest three-hour mark,  and that the intention of the author of the Mark Gospel was to provide the setting for the three hours of darkness while the Gospel of John seeks to stress the length of the proceedings, starting in the 'early morning'\"The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K\u00f6stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009  page 538 Some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning.Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965), Chronology of The Last Days of Jesus \u2013 A Critical Study [Trans. from German] (pp. 35\u201371 for \u2018The Chronology of \u201cMore Than One Day\u201d) William Barclay has argued that the portrayal of the death of Jesus in the John Gospel is a literary construct, presenting the crucifixion as taking place at the time on the day of Passover when the sacrificial lamb would be killed, and thus portraying Jesus as the Lamb of God. This understanding fits with Old Testament typology, in which Jesus entered Jerusalem to identify himself as the Paschal lamb on Nisan 10 was crucified and died at 3:00 in the afternoon of Nisan 14, at the same time the High Priest would have sacrificed the Paschal lamb, and rose before dawn the morning of Nisan 16, as a type of offering of the First Fruits."]}, {"page": "Lithgow, New South Wales", "response": ["* Leon Morris (1914-2006) - Theologian and New Testament Scholar."]}, {"page": "F.

This points to the idea that 'synagogue' might refer to a grouping of the community, rather than a building used for worship.

Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1992), 253.", "Therefore, it does stand in marked contrast to the beginning of Jesus' commission, telling the twelve not to approach the Samaritans, much less the nations. The plurality of governors and kings suggests the situation of the Church after Peter's vision in Acts. Morris believes that this shows a shift in Jesus' meaning, from talking earlier about the immediate mission he was sending His twelve out for in Galilee, to now and following talking about their later missions to the Gentiles. This is because their restricted mission to the people of Israel would not have brought them into contact with the governors and kings of whom he spoke.Leon Morris, 254.", "The 'deliver[ing] up' and being put to death point to execution by authorities.R.T. France, 393-4. This is in continuity with the echo of verses 17 and 19, which dealt with being accused before the sanhedrins.

France, 395-6 Hagner rejects the early defining moments of Christianity as being too early for the persecution of the preceding verses to have developed. Working from the background of 'Son of man' in Daniel 7, where the figure approaches God, Morris does look to either the Resurrection or Ascension as the meaning of the mysterious phrase. He notes that at the time there was still work to be done in Israel.Leon Morris, 257. This is less natural than Hagner's interpretation, because it was not until after Pentecost that the twelve were persecuted as described in verses 17\u201322. Morris seems to have forgotten that he made this same point\u2014just a few verses earlier, Jesus had shifted into speaking about the situation of the Church after he was to leave.
