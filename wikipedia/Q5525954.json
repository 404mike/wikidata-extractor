After a brief spell with Colchester United, Smith joined non-league side Enfield in 1989. His most successful spell during his playing days was at Wycombe Wanderers, spending two seasons with the club. After a season with Welling United, Smith returned to the Football League in 1993, when he signed for Barnet. Following a spell at Aylesbury United, Smith retired as a professional player, with his career blighted through numerous injuries.\nHe turned to the coaching side of the game in an attempt to forge a career for himself following his premature retirement. After a spell coaching at Wimbledon, Smith was appointed youth team coach at Wycombe Wanderers in 2004. He joined Watford ahead of the 2005\u201306 campaign, combining the roles of reserve team manager with his U18 managerial duties. Smith then worked as a scout for Arsenal in 2007. His first managerial post was at MLS side Colorado Rapids, when he was appointed as manager in November 2008, following a successful spell as interim head coach. He spent three seasons at Colorado, with the club winning the 2010 MLS Cup, the first major trophy in the club's history. Despite his success, Colorado opted against renewing Smith's contract in November 2011. In January 2012, Smith was appointed as manager of League One side Stevenage. He guided the club to the League One play-offs that season, where they were defeated over two legs in the semi-final. In March 2013, he was sacked by the club after a poor run of form during the second half of the 2012\u201313 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Major League Soccer", "response": ["| Gary Smith"]}, {"page": "Colorado Rapids", "response": ["Heading into the 2008 season, Rapids GM Charlie Wright added depth to the midfield and defense. Major signings included Christian G\u00f3mez and Jose Burciaga Jr. The 2008 season saw a resurgent Rapids side, which started off the season with a complete thrashing of David Beckham and the LA Galaxy by a 4\u20130 score on Opening Day to launch the season. However, an inconsistent mid-season stretch where, for 13 games,  the Rapids could not win two games in a row or lose 2 in a row, saw Clavijo resign from the head coach position for personal reasons, and saw Gary Smith, an assistant coach who came from the Arsenal F.C. system, take over on an interim basis with 11 games left in the season. Under Smith's direction, the Rapids surged into the playoff race, with two key away wins, but fall short of the playoffs in the last game of the season, against Real Salt Lake. Salt Lake tied the Rapids 1\u20131 in the 90th minute of that game to eliminate the Rapids from playoff contention. Because of the signs of improvement shown in the last 11 games, Smith was hired as the head coach.", "The 2009 campaign featured head coach Gary Smith in his first full season. Smith took over the reins from Fernando Clavijo as interim manager after Clavijo resigned. Smith's first appointment was ex-England international Steve Guppy as his assistant; Guppy had spent the previous season at USL-1 team Rochester Rhinos as their player assistant coach. Shortly after, Rapids veteran midfielder Pablo Mastroeni re-signed with the club for four years after mulling potential offers from Europe. The Rapids also signed new four-year contracts with midfielders Colin Clark and Nick LaBrocca and defenders Jordan Harvey and Kosuke Kimura. The Colorado Rapids acquired former QPR and Chicago Fire goalkeeper Matt Pickens to replace Senegalese goalkeeper Bouna Coundoul. The other major roster move included the arrival of Ivan Guerrero from D.C. United in exchange for midfielder Christian Gomez and backup goalkeeper Mike Graczyk. The media criticized the Rapids for not making more roster changes for the 2009 season. However, the core of the team remained intact.", "The 2012 season began with several changes to the club. Oscar Pareja was appointed head coach following the departure of Gary Smith.  The team traded Sanna Nyassi to the Montreal Impact, and Macoumba Kandji to Houston Dynamo. Acquiring Hunter Freeman, Jaime Castrill\u00f3n, Luis Zapata, and young Kamani Hill and the loan of young talent Mart\u00edn Rivero the Rapids looked to begin on a positive note. After defeating the Columbus Crew 2\u20130 on opening day, things seemed promising. However, as the season ticked by, things started to turn for the worst. Looking for a turnaround, H\u00e1rrison Henao was loaned and Brazilian Edu was signed. In July, Kosuke Kimura was traded to the Portland Timbers. Shortly after, defender Tyson Wahl was brought in via trade from the Montreal Impact. After a poor season, the Rapids looked for a late-season turnaround when they signed Hendry Thomas from Wigan Athletic. The Rapids were eliminated from playoff contention in late September ending hopes for another MLS cup.", "| Gary Smith"]}, {"page": "Stevenage F.C.", "response": ["Despite the rise through the leagues in such a short period, Stevenage started their first season in League One well, securing notable victories against a number of the promotion-chasing clubs.

In January 2012, Westley opted to leave Stevenage in order to take up the vacant managerial position at Preston North End. Former Colorado Rapids manager Gary Smith replaced Westley. A run of four wins in their last five games meant that Stevenage finished in sixth, thus taking the final play-off place, although they went on to lose by a 1\u20130 aggregate scoreline to Sheffield United in the semi-final.
