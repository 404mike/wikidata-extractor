He is the founder of online trading company CMC Markets. In the 2007 Sunday Times Rich List, he was named the richest man in the City of London, with an estimated fortune of \u00a3860 million. As of March 2012, Forbes estimated his wealth at $1.3 billion.Cruddas was appointed Conservative Party co-treasurer in June 2011. In March 2012 it was alleged by The Sunday Times that he had offered access to the Prime Minister David Cameron and the Chancellor George Osborne, in exchange for cash donations of between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3250,000. Cruddas resigned the same day.In June 2013, Cruddas successfully sued The Sunday Times for libel over its coverage of him, which the High Court found had been defamatory. However, in March 2015, an appeal court reduced the libel damages and made Cruddas repay \u00a3130,000 of the original \u00a3180,000 in damages, ruling that the Sunday Times's central allegation around \"cash for access\" had been borne out by the facts, while also ruling that a series of subsidiary allegations made in the same Sunday Times article were still false and defamatory.In December 2020, it was announced he would be conferred a Life Peerage after a nomination by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, despite the contrary advice of the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which unanimously recommended that the Prime Minister rescind his nomination. It was later revealed that he donated \u00a3500,000 to the Conservative Party days after being elevated to the House of Lords.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas"]}, {"page": "2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum", "response": ["The 'No' campaign released a list of donors on 9 April 2011, which included several major donors to the Conservative Party, including Lord (John) Sainsbury, Michael Farmer, Lord Harris, Lord FinkAV: Tories come out in support of no campaign to the tune of \u00a31.8m, by Nicolas Watt, The Guardian, 9 April 2011 and Lord Edmiston.Inside the Yes and No AV referendum campaigns, by James Silver, 7 April 2011, BBC News In total, the 'No' campaign had raised by that date \u00a31.8m in donations of over the declarable limit of \u00a37,500 from 41 donors, with the largest being from billionaire Peter Cruddas, founder of the CMC spread betting firm, who gave \u00a3400,000."]}, {"page": "2012 United Kingdom cash for access scandal", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas"]}, {"page": "2012 United Kingdom Cash for Access scandal", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas "]}, {"page": "Dinnergate", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas"]}, {"page": "Peter Cruddas Foundation", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas#Philanthropy"]}, {"page": "Cruddas, Peter", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas"]}, {"page": "Peter Cruddas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas"]}, {"page": "Baron Cruddas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas"]}, {"page": "Lord Cruddas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Cruddas, Baron Cruddas"]}]}}
