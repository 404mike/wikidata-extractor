Vale were in the relegation zone of the Second Division, and after a FA Cup first-round defeat to Ryman Leaguers Canvey Island, the team seemed to be heading towards another relegation, with fans once again protesting against chairman Bill Bell. However, there was change in fortunes after the turn of the year, as Brian Horton's team transformed their league form to pull up to a top-half finish while also gaining silverware by beating Brentford in the final of the Football League Trophy. This included a post\u2013war record of sixteen matches unbeaten in all competitions, with Vale eventually finishing eleventh. After the League Trophy-winning season, the Valiants lost the services of veterans Tony Naylor and Allen Tankard, but young prospects Steve Brooker, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and new signings Stephen McPhee and Ian Armstrong were waiting in the wings. However, Vale suffered from inconsistency, and finished the 2001\u201302 campaign in fourteenth place. With further discontent at the running of the club, a supporters' trust under the banner \"Valiant 2001\" started moves towards attaining ownership of the club, including several offers that were rejected by chairman Bell. The next season, 2002\u201303, was to see Vale's financial problems come to a head. With first-round exits in both cup competitions and another mediocre season in the league on the cards, Bill Bell eventually called in the administrators with the club around \u00a31.5 million in debt."]}, {"page": "2001 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["The first round saw Port Vale breeze past a second-string Notts County team 3\u20130 at Vale Park, ending a 300 minute goal drought in the process.
