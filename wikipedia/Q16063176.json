It has a two-storey porch, battlemented like the tower. Inside, the north and south aisles are separated from the nave by arcades of five bays, constructed of octagonal granite piers. All the windows are of standard Perpendicular design, and according to Pevsner there is \"a singular absence of fitments of interest\", due to the heavy restorations the church was subjected to in 1856 and in 1904\u20135. All the ledger stones were removed with the floor flagstones in the first restoration, but above the south door a wall memorial to Rev Francis Whiddon, MA (died 1656) who \"was 32 years minister of this parish\" survives.
