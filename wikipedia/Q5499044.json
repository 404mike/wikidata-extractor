He signed for Small Heath in April 1891, and played in a few friendly matches at the end of that season. With Harry Morris struggling for fitness towards the end of his career, Wilkes was one of six players tried at centre forward during the 1891\u201392 Football Alliance season. He scored a hat-trick in the Fourth Qualifying Round of the FA Cup against Brierley Hill Alliance. At the end of the season he moved into non-league football with Brownhills.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wilkes (surname)", "response": ["*Frederick Wilkes (1869\u2013after 1892), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Players leaving included Will Devey, top scorer in the previous two seasons, who joined Football League club Wolverhampton Wanderers. New players included the former Warwick County players George Hollis (goalkeeper), Billy Ollis (centre half) and Frederick Wilkes (centre forward). In a friendly match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the end of the previous season, Hollis appeared to lack confidence, Ollis \"would have been more useful if he had looked after the ball a little more instead of his opponents\", and Wilkes' passing was wild but did \"some smart work\" and contributed to a goal with \"exceedingly plucky play\".Notes on Sport.

Arthur Carter, a forward who had also joined Small Heath from Warwick County, was obliged to retire on medical advice after a serious leg injury.Northern Notes.

The Post kept up its encouragement:", "George Hollis's goalkeeping came in for praise as Small Heath began their season in a howling gale, despite Aston Villa beating their visitors 5\u20131 in a friendly match. The committee experimented with their team selection for the first Alliance match of the season, at home to Burton Swifts, Fred Speller moving up from full back to partner Jack Hallam on the right side of the forward line. Small Heath took an early lead through a combination of Frederick Wilkes and Hallam, but Burton, showing more skill than the home forwards, equalised in the first half. After the interval, Hallam scored after Wilkes' shot was parried, then Wilkes himself made the final score 3\u20131.The Alliance. Small Heath v. Burton. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 7 September 1891. Despite playing into the sun, Birmingham St George's took a first-half lead, increased early in the second half. Small Heath's shooting was poor throughout, but Walter Brown eventually scored with a header from Tommy Hands' cross, and on the stroke of time, Hands himself secured a \"lucky draw\".Notes on Sport and The Alliance. Small Heath v. St. George's. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 5. 14 September 1891. A \"sturdy, bustling game\" got the better of West Bromwich Albion in a friendly by four goals to nil, Hallam contributing three and Billy Walton the fourth. Billy Ollis had to leave the field with a damaged eye after colliding with fellow half back Caesar Jenkyns."]}]}}
