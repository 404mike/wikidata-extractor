Jardine himself had to face bodyline bowling in a Test match. The West Indian cricket team toured England in 1933, and, in the second Test at Old Trafford, Jackie Grant, their captain, decided to try bodyline. He had a couple of fast bowlers, Manny Martindale and Learie Constantine. Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4, with Wally Hammond being hit on the chin, though he recovered to continue his innings. Then Jardine himself faced Martindale and Constantine. Jardine never flinched. With Les Ames finding himself in difficulties, Jardine said, \"You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense.\"Douglas, p.166. He played right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and played them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. While the Old Trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard Australian wickets, Martindale did take 5 for 73, but Constantine only took 1 for 55. Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century. In the West Indian second innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64. The match in the end was drawn but played a large part in turning English opinion against bodyline. The Times used the word bodyline, without using inverted commas or using the qualification so-called, for the first time.Douglas, p.168. Wisden also said that \"most of those watching it for the first time must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice.\"See Cricinfo for the scorecard of the second Test between England and West Indies in 1933.", "The English players and management were consistent in referring to their tactic as fast leg theory considering it to be a variant of the established and unobjectionable leg theory tactic. The inflammatory term \"bodyline\" was coined and perpetuated by the Australian press (see below). English writers used the term fast leg theory. The terminology reflected differences in understanding, as neither the English public nor the Board of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)\u2014the governing body of English cricket\u2014could understand why the Australians were complaining about what they perceived as a commonly used tactic. Some concluded that the Australian cricket authorities and public were sore losers.Frith, pp. 142, 222, 231\u2013238.Pollard, p. 258. Of the four fast bowlers in the tour party, Gubby Allen was a voice of dissent in the English camp, refusing to bowl short on the leg side, and writing several letters home to England critical of Jardine, although he did not express this in public in Australia. A number of other players, while maintaining a united front in public, also deplored bodyline in private. The amateurs Bob Wyatt (the vice-captain), Freddie Brown and the Nawab of Pataudi opposed it, as did Wally Hammond and Les Ames among the professionals.E. W. Swanton.

After this England won three Tests by an innings to take the series 3\u20130, with Cowdrey making back to back centuries with his 152 in the Second Test at Lords after coming in at 34/3, 55 in the Third at Trent Bridge and 68 in the Fourth at Headingley. He finished with 435 runs (72.50), the first time he had averaged over 36 in a Test series. This was the year that he took over from Doug Wright as the captain of Kent with Les Ames as the manager, although it would be ten years before the county reaped the rewards. ", "Dexter was back in charge in the rain-soaked 1964 Ashes series. Cowdrey played in the First and Second Tests, making 32, 33 and 10, but was injured and England lost the Third Test and with it the series 1\u20130. Cowdrey returned for the Fifth Test to make 20 and 93 not out, finishing with 188 runs (47.00). More importantly he took the catches for Fred Trueman's 299th and 300th Test wickets. In the County Championship Cowdrey's captaincy and his long-term plans with Les Ames were starting to pay off as Kent moved up to 7th place. ", "Cowdrey made 107 when the MCC beat Jamaica by 174 runs and they went into the Second Test at Kingston with more confidence. He won the toss again and made 101 in England's 376 and forced the West Indies to follow on again when Snow's 7/49 dismissed them for 143. The West Indies were 204/5 on the day four and when Basil Butcher was caught behind off Basil D'Oliveira the crowd rioted and threw bottles onto the outfield. Cowdrey tried to calm the crowd without success and play was abandoned as the police used tear gas to restore order. Cowdrey and the manager Les Ames reluctantly agreed to resume play to help placate the crowd and an extra 75 minutes was added on the sixth day to make up for lost time.Cowdrey, pp. 179\u201381 Sobers thought it wouldn't be needed as they had battled so badly, but the riot had unsettled the England team. The West Indian captain made 113 not out and was able to declare at 391/9, leaving England 190 to win on the extra day. Boycott and Cowdrey made ducks and English crashed to 43/4 at the end of day five and barely survived with 68/8 after the extra time on day six. Sobers took 3/33 and Lance Gibbs 3/11, which would have grave repercussions in the Fourth Test. ", "With the South African tour cancelled a new one was arranged to Ceylon and Pakistan, which was in political turmoil that resulted in the fall of President Ayub Khan and imposition of martial law by his successor General Yahya Khan. After a few easy-going matches in Ceylon the tour match against the West Pakistan Governor's XI saw play abandoned after 25 overs, there were no other tour matches and all the Tests were affected by political demonstrations against the military regime. In the First Test at Lahore Cowdrey won the toss and made exactly 100, his 22nd Test century to match Wally Hammond's England record. England made 309, dismissed Pakistan for 209 and Cowdrey declared the second innings at 225/9 to give them 326 to win, but Pakistan made 203/5 for a draw. Saeed Ahmed won the toss in the Second Test at Dacca in East Pakistan, soon to be Bangladesh, where there was rioting and gunfire around the team hotel.Snow, pp. 66\u201368 Pakistan made 246, which was matched by England's 274, thanks to D'Oliveira's 114 not out. Pakistan took 101 overs to make 196/5 and a token declaration left England to make 33/0. Cowdrey won the toss again in the Third Test at Karachi, but there were riots on the first two days by fans who wanted Hanif Mohammad as captain instead of Saeed. England piled up 502/7, with Colin Milburn making 139 and Tom Graveney 105, but the match was abandoned after demonstrators wrecked the stadium on the morning of the third day, leaving Alan Knott stranded on 96 not out. Cowdrey was not there to see it as he left on the second day after his father-in-law died,Cowdrey, p. 78 leaving Graveney in charge. The team followed on the third day, with manager Les Ames abandoning the Test and the rest of the tour to save the team.Snow, p. 73"]}, {"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["Although Laker took 166 wickets in 1950, his highest-ever season tally, the selectors continued to ignore him when they chose their squad to tour Australia in 1950\u201351 and so he accepted an invitation to tour India and Ceylon with a Commonwealth XI, playing in ten matches and taking 36 wickets. The Commonwealth squad was a multi-talented group considered stronger than the England one touring Australia. It was nominally captained by Les Ames but, because of injuries, he handed over to Frank Worrell. The Commonwealth XI were undefeated in 29 matches played between 1 October and 6 March, including four unofficial \"tests\" against India and one against Ceylon. Laker had to return home in early December because of sinusitis but he enjoyed the tour. He later recalled one incident when a huge rat ran across the field and onto the pitch just as he was about to bowl. Laker stopped and was then astonished to see a kite hawk swoop down, seize the rat in its talons and fly away with it. Laker was used to pigeons on the field at The Oval and he was so surprised by this that, when he did bowl the next ball, it bounced twice and was struck to the boundary."]}, {"page": "Len Hutton", "response": ["Commentators mainly praised Hutton's concentration and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly when compared to Bradman's innings of 334, was excused on the grounds that the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible.Howat, pp. 39\u201340. Among views expressed by Test cricketers, Les Ames believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain Bob Wyatt described the innings as one of the greatest feats of concentration and endurance in the history of the game.Hill, pp. 177\u201378. Some critics expressed distaste at England's approach, but this opinion was not widely shared.Birley, pp. 257\u201358. In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous, in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of the worst things that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted.Howat, pp. 40\u201342. When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45."]}, {"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["The Bodyline controversy continued into the 1933 season. Bodyline tactics were used in several matches, including by the West Indian tourists in the second Test.Frith, pp. 355, 361\u201364. In all first-class cricket, Hammond, no longer vice-captain of Gloucestershire, scored 3,323 runs, passing 3,000 in a season for the first time. With an average of 67.81, he topped the first-class tables for what would be the first of eight successive seasons. He also took 38 wickets. However, his highest score in three Test innings was 34. In the second Test, unsettled by Bodyline, Hammond was cut on the chin by a short ball, causing him to retire hurt. He again commented that he would quit rather than face such bowling; soon after his return, he was out. Les Ames, who played in the three-match series, won by England 2\u20130, believed that the West Indian pacemen worried Hammond, who showed a weakness against short, fast bowling.Foot, p. 129.", "However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he had fewer effective leg-side shots.Swanton, p. 112.Foot, p. 127. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His teammate Charlie Barnett said that he did not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.Murphy, p. 103."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Les Ames"]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["Some bowlers had experimented with Bodyline in the season, and the West Indian team, 1\u20130 down in the series and frustrated by the lack of pace in the pitches, decided to experiment with the tactic.Douglas, p. 165. Facing a good West Indies total, England suffered a batting collapse, at one point falling to 134 for four. With Les Ames in difficulty against the short-pitched bowling, Jardine said, \"You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense.\"Douglas, p. 166. He went right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and stopped them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. Wisden described how he never flinched despite facing the greatest amount of Bodyline. It also believed that he played it \"probably better than any other man in the world was capable of doing.\" He batted for nearly five hours, scoring 127, his only Test century.Douglas, p. 167. England then retaliated by bowling Bodyline in the West Indies' second innings, but the slow pitch meant that the match was drawn.

The second Test saw the Windies win by 217 runs, and a drawn third Test saw the series go to a decider at Sabina Park in Jamaica.

At Lord's, in the second match, England scored 440 in their first innings but after the second day's play, Australia were well positioned, having reached 192 for two wickets. Verity was the only bowler to trouble the batsmen and caught and bowled Bradman, who had scored a quick 36\u00a0runs.Cardus (1934), pp. 181\u201383. After rain fell overnight, the pitch changed to become helpful to spin; Wisden reported that: \"although the wicket certainly helped [Verity] considerably it could scarcely be described as genuinely sticky except for one period after lunch.\" On the third day, Australia lost their last eight wickets while scoring 92\u00a0runs. Verity took six of the wickets to achieve bowling figures of seven for 61. The tourists just failed to score enough runs to make England bat again and were forced to follow on: Cardus wrote: \"Verity settled the issue like a great bowler\".Cardus (1934), p. 193. England wicket-keeper Les Ames believed this was crucial to an England victory, or the home team would have batted in very difficult conditions. When Australia batted again, Verity took eight for 43, dismissing Bradman a second time, to give him match figures of 15 for 104; 14 of the wickets came on the third day. Cardus believed the Australian batsmen played very badly against Verity's spin,Cardus (1934), p. 196. while the Wisden correspondent wrote: \"This amazing achievement would probably have been only possible to a man possessed of such length and finger-spin as Verity\u00a0... Verity's length was impeccable and he made the ball come back and lift so abruptly that most of the Australians were helpless. The majority of them had had no experience in England of such a pitch, and they showed no ability or skill in dealing with bowling like that of Verity under these conditions; their efforts at playing back were, to say the least, immature.\" Afterwards, this game became known in cricket circles as \"Verity's match\"; it was the only occasion in the 20th century when England beat Australia at Lord's, and their last such win for 75\u00a0years.", "Verity is often cited as one of the greatest slow left-arm spinners to play the game. Robertson-Glasgow wrote: \"We can only say that, in his own short time, he was the best of his kind.\" The writer considered Verity may not quite have achieved the heights of some other great bowlers of his type, but \"as a workman-artist, he will take some beating.\" Douglas Jardine rated him higher than any previous Yorkshire spinners,Hill, p. 167. and Les Ames considered him the best left-arm spinner he had played against.Hill, p. 168. Bradman wrote: \"Undoubtedly he was one of the greatest slow left-handed spinners of all time. His record testifies to that.

Wyatt said that: \"Herbert never hesitated in his views about our bowling strategy. He did not see anything wrong about pursuing the tactics\". Les Ames agreed with Wyatt's view and said that, though the majority of the England players were morally opposed to Jardine's tactics, Sutcliffe took the pragmatic view that \"the ball is there, it's short, so hook it\".  Sutcliffe himself was an outstanding player of the hook shot but Ames was unsure about how he would have coped with Larwood's accuracy if he had been playing against him.  According to Bill O'Reilly, Sutcliffe was the strongest advocate of bodyline and he sometimes acted like an \"unofficial captain\", even initiating the tactics on his own responsibility. However, a close friend of Sutcliffe insisted that Sutcliffe \"was always behind authority\" and was absolutely loyal to his captain, but his private views about bodyline were another matter.", "England wicket-keeper Les Ames, himself a top-class batsman, commented on their running together between the wickets by emphasising the placement of the stroke, which was so correct that they could \"just play and run\".

What followed was what the series had been crying out for earlier: a spirited Bangladeshi performance with proper cricketing shots.

The second Test of the MCC 1929\u201330 tour of the West Indies saw England under Les Ames defeat the West Indies under Errol Hunte thanks largely to a century by the England captain and a double-century by Patsy Hendren. The ground also hosted the Second Test of the 1935 tour, which started on 24 January. This time the West Indies recorded its first Test match victory at the ground, defeating Bob Wyatt's England by 217 runs. Between the Tests, the ground had also hosted several of the first-class matches of the tour, as well as continuing to host matches of the Inter-Colonial Tournament, including the 1935 and 1937 finals."]}, {"page": "Eddie Paynter", "response": ["Paynter was then out of the England side for a time, but in 1937 his county form \u2013 2,904 runs and a five-hour triple century against Sussex brought him a recall against New Zealand, as well as Wisden Cricketer of the Year recognition in the next year's Almanack. In 1938 Paynter had another outstanding series against Australia, averaging 101.75 and hitting 216 not out at Nottingham, at the time an England record for Ashes Tests in England. He also filled in very competently as wicket-keeper when Les Ames was injured at Lord's.

Hutton held the record for the highest individual Test innings at the time with the 364 that he scored against Australia in 1938, and Hammond boasted 7,249 Test runs at an average of 58.45 over his career, despite being over 40 by the time the Victory Tests were played."]}, {"page": "Godfrey Evans", "response": ["England toured South Africa in 1956/57. Evans played in all five Tests of a series that was drawn 2\u20132. In the second Test Evans scored 62 during England's first innings, he shared in a 93-run sixth wicket stand with Colin Cowdrey, it was the largest partnership of the match. Evans innings was his first Test score of more than fifty runs since 1952. When on four he reached a career total of 2,000 Test runs, only the second wicket-keeper after Les Ames to achieve the milestone. England led the series 2\u20131 but lost the final Test at Port Elizabeth in controversial circumstances. The match was played on a pitch that had been re-laid only three months previous, the wicket was slow and the ball kept 'exceptionally low' according to Wisden. The match produced a scoring rate of 1.40, the lowest ever in a Test match. Evans scored 21 in England's second innings but the tourists fell 58 runs short of their target. He also took six catches and in the difficult conditions conceded just one bye. Wisden commented that it was: \"an extraordinary performance by an extraordinary man\". Evans took a total of 20 dismissals in the series, a record for his career."]}, {"page": "Fred Price (cricketer)", "response": ["Price was unfortunate to be around in the same era as Les Ames, which limited Price's opportunities for an international career.

He played his first game for the county in 1923 and his last in 1938 and went on to become a member of the Lancashire committee. 1928 was his best season, with him taking 77 catches and 30 stumpings, and this earned him the accolade of being one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1929. He played 24 Test matches for England, but as a wicket-keeper he was in direct competition in his later years with Les Ames, who was a much better batsman. He was awarded a benefit in 1934, which raised \u00a31,257. He was reputed to have the loudest shout of appeal of any cricketer of his time."]}]}}
