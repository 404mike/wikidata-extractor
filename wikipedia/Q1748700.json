He won the 1972\u201373 DFB-Pokal, 1974\u201375 UEFA Cup, and two Bundesliga championships in his four years at the club.

He played three successful years at Real Madrid, winning the 1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379 La Liga championships. While in Madrid, he scored the 300th goal in the European competition for the club. He moved to the Netherlands in 1979, to play for defending Dutch Eredivisie champions Ajax Amsterdam of the coaches Cor Brom and Leo Beenhakker. He met in Amsterdam other Danish players like Frank Arnesen and S\u00f8ren Lerby (and two years later also for a very short period Jesper Olsen). The routined player had to work hard for his position in the team for the first time at the age of 30 years. The midfielder had much rivalry from Frank Arnesen, Dick Schoenaker and S\u00f8ren Lerby, which trio formed one of the strongest (attacking) midfields of Europe those years. Jensen started as centre forward, when central attacker Ray Clarke was sold. Thereafter he played at the wings, as wing attacker for a period. When Frank Arnesen had been injured a part of the 1979\u201380 season Jensen moved to the midfield, there playing his best matches for Ajax Amsterdam. In the season 1979\u201380 he won with Ajax the Dutch Eredivisie league championship and also the semi-finals of the European Cup tournament for champions were reached that season."]}]}}
