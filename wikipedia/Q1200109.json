Although Redmond was disqualified and listed as \"Did Not Finish\" due to the outside assistance finishing the race, the incident has become a well-remembered moment in Olympic history, having been the subject of one of the International Olympic Committee's \"Celebrate Humanity\" videos and been used in advertisements by Visa as an illustration of the Olympic spirit and featured in Nike's \"Courage\" commercials in 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linford Christie", "response": ["In the successful British bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, Christie was absent from the team, even though he has stated that he attempted to get involved.

One notable variant in 2001 saw the regulars feeling an animal, having been shown a clip of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson on Italian television trying to identify animals by touch alone. David Gower and Jonathan Ross correctly guessed their animal (a zebra) but Gary Lineker and Rory McGrath failed to get theirs (an alligator \u2013 they failed to even touch it), with McGrath and Lineker removing their blindfolds and running off the set in panic. Occasionally, the guests get to play in lieu of one of the regulars; a notable example was Sharron Davies, when the sportsman was her then husband Derek Redmond, whom she recognised."]}]}}
