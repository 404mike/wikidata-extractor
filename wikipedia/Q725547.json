He was the 2009 British Road Race Champion. He has raced in Europe and Australia. He rode for Great Britain in UCI World Cup track events. In 2006, he rode for the Recycling.co.uk team and in 2007 he signed for Navigators Insurance.\nKristian House was born in Britain but moved to the United States as a child, growing up initially in New Jersey and then Austin, Texas, where he began racing as a junior. At 17 he began racing in Belgium, where he stayed for two-and-a-half years. He was selected for the Great Britain Under-23 squad at the UCI Road World Championships in 2000 and 2001, although he did not compete in 2000 after crashing out of Paris-Tours at the same corner as Jan Ullrich. After considering retiring from the sport at the age of 23 due to not securing a professional contract, he joined the Team GB track endurance squad after being introduced to team coach Simon Jones by John Herety, the manager of the British road team.After representing Britain in road and track world championships, he concentrated on road-racing in 2006 after joining the Recycling.co.uk team, now managed by Herety, and won ten races in Europe and Tasmania. They included Ireland's FBD Insurance R\u00e1s, where he overhauled Danny Pate. After one year with the American UCI Professional Continental team Navigators, House returned to the UK to link up with Herety again at Rapha Condor\u2013Recycling.co.uk.In 2009 House became national road race champion in Abergavenny, having finished in the top five six times previously: initially joining the breakaway to provide anticipated support to his planned team leaders for the race, Chris Newton and Tom Southam, House was part of a trio alongside Dan Lloyd and Peter Kennaugh that caught race leader Chris Froome with 800 metres to go, before House won the sprint for the line. He remained with the Rapha Condor team until 2016, when he joined ONE Pro Cycling. In April 2017 he announced that he would retire from competition at the end of the season. In December of that year, JLT-Condor announced that House would be rejoining the team for the following year, taking up a role as the team's performance manager.House was granted the Freedom of the City of London in 2014.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Kristian House"]}, {"page": "2005 Tour de Langkawi", "response": ["|style=\"background:salmon;\" rowspan=2|Kristian House", "|style=\"background:salmon;\" rowspan=3|Kristian House", "*  Kristian House"]}, {"page": "2006 Tour de Langkawi", "response": ["*  Kristian House"]}, {"page": "R\u00e1s Tailteann", "response": ["|54|| 2006 || Kristian House ||  || Recycling.co.uk || Morten Hegreberg  || Ciar\u00e1n Power   ||"]}, {"page": "2006 British National Road Race Championships", "response": ["|align=center| 6 || Kristian House||align=right|+ 0.08"]}, {"page": "McCallum High School", "response": ["*Kristian House, professional cyclist"]}, {"page": "British National Road Race Championships", "response": ["| 2009 || Kristian House || Daniel Lloyd || Peter Kennaugh"]}, {"page": "Premier Calendar", "response": ["| align=left|Kristian House"]}, {"page": "British National Madison Championships", "response": ["| 2003 || Russell Downing & Dean Downing || Kieran Page & Huw Pritchard || Russell Anderson & Kristian House"]}]}}
