The Spanish vessel had already been damaged in the action and after a fierce fight lasting less than an hour surrendered to the British.  Defence suffered only 34 casualties in return.  San Ildefonso was successfully sailed to Gibraltar by the British, surviving the storm that followed the battle.  She was taken into British service as HMS Ildefonso. Ildefonso was laid up at Portsmouth until 3 April 1806 when she was placed under the command of newly promoted Captain John Quilliam, a veteran of Trafalgar.  The ship was paid off in Portsmouth on 19 June but recommissioned on 22 July 1808 under Captain Edward Harvey.
