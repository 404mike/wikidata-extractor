I used to write them whenever I'd seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl\u00a0... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying\".Thwaite, p. 70 Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin's early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clich\u00e9s. They are an early demonstration of Larkin's talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of \"The School in August\": \"And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey\".
