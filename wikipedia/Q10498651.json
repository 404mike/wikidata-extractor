The two sides have twice previously met in the competition, firstly in 1949 when the U's were defeated 1\u20130 away, and more recently in 1983 when they won 4\u20130 at Layer Road. Colchester's game on 7 November proved as fruitful as their previous encounter, recording a 6\u20132 victory at the Freebets.co.uk stadium. Macauley Bonne opened the scoring following a goalless first 26 minutes, but the U's were pegged back by their sixth tier opponents five minutes later when Jefferson Louis converted a penalty after Joe Edwards had fouled in the area. Colchester fell behind on 38 minutes when Bradley Hudson-Odoi scored from close range to make it 2\u20131 to the home side, but Bonne levelled the score with his second on 44 minutes, heading in Callum Harriott's cross. Bonne sealed his hat-trick two-minutes after half-time to reinstate Colchester's lead, before scoring his fourth goal on 68 minutes. George Moncur scored Colchester's fifth goal in the 82nd minute, before Marvin Sordell rounded off the match with a 90th-minute effort. Bonne was brought off in the final minute of stoppage time, making way for debutant midfielder Jack Curtis to experience his first brief taste of professional football. Bonne's goal haul was the first time a Colchester United player had scored a hat-trick since Jamie Cureton against Southend United on 6 April 2007, and equalled Colchester's record for the most goals in a competitive game by a single player. He joined the likes of Arthur Pritchard, Arthur Turner, Vic Keeble, Neil Langman, Bobby Hunt, Martyn King, Bobby Svarc, Roy McDonough, and Chris Iwelumo, the last of whom scored the most recent quadruple against Hull City at Layer Road on 28 November 2006."]}]}}
