He is widely known for hats worn by the Queen \u2013 from whom he held a Royal Warrant \u2013 and Diana, Princess of Wales. He also created headgear worn by two James Bond villainesses.\nHis obituary in The Sunday Times said of his influence on Princess Diana's fashion sense: \"he helped to mould her style \u2013 and with it the country's taste in hats\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* Philip Somerville"]}, {"page": "Kings' School, Winchester", "response": ["*Philip Somerville, milliner (at St Thomas's School)."]}, {"page": "Graham Smith (milliner)", "response": ["While British millinery was in decline from the 1960s on, Smith (alongside Philip Somerville and Frederick Fox) is credited with keeping the craft alive during the 1970s, thanks in part to the tradition of hat-wearing events such as Royal Ascot and the custom of the British Royal Family."]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Philip Somerville, 84, milliner."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2014", "response": ["*Philip Somerville, 84, English milliner.Philip Somerville \u2013 obituary"]}, {"page": "Otto Lucas", "response": ["Lucas was responsible for training many future milliners \u2013 notably leading hatmakers to the Queen, Frederick Fox and Philip Somerville, both of whom completed apprenticeships at his studio.

She learned the trade for three years, as one of a workroom of 14 women in his studio near Oxford Street, then working for another royal hat designer Philip Somerville between 1988 and 1990. Trevor-Morgan has said of her training with two of London's most celebrated milliners that Graham Smith taught her how to get the hat right and Philip Somerville taught her about \"people relations\".
