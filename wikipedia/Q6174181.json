He is known throughout South Wales as an outspoken local politician. He retired from politics in 2004 before the Labour administration - which had held power since 1996 -  was defeated by a coalition in the June 2004 council elections.In March 2006 Jones was cleared of claims he had breached the council's code of conduct, after a grievance had been brought against him by a council employee about comments made on a television programme in 2003. Jones' comments were described by the local government ombudsman as \"somewhat hostile\" but not \"abusive\".Jones has subsequently set himself up as a local government consultant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification", "response": ["Jane Davidson, Welsh Government Minister for Education, Lifelong Learning & Skills from 2000 to 2007, responded to the pair's criticism by stating that the Welsh Baccalaureate is \"a significant innovation which will broaden students' programmes and bring coherence to them. The programme will be distinctive, modern and proudly Welsh.\" She explained that \"The contract to design and deliver the Welsh baccalaureate was awarded following a tender process... In the event we received no tenders based on the IWA model.\"Welsh bac is several steps forwards TES, 11 May 2008 Jeff Jones, chair of the WJEC when it bid for and developed the WBQ, stated in 2011 that he thought at the time that the WBQ \"looked like nonsense\" but that the WJEC \"needed the money and in any case we had to bid because we were the Welsh exam board\". Jones added that the WBQ was \"really an A level with a load of nonsense added on\" and added: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a proper Bac where students at 18 would still be required to study maths, English, a science and a language, not meaningless Mickey Mouse additions. What the heck is the use of \u2018Wales and the World\u2019 for a start? No wonder Russell Group universities who can get students from England with four A stars are not that interested. If I were a student I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.\" The University of Leeds, which is ranked 2nd in the United Kingdom in the Russell Group, does not accept Welsh Baccalaureate. Most Welsh secondary schools mandate their 6th form students study the Welsh Baccalaureate alongside their A Level studies insisting it's a compulsory subject that \"compliments\" a students learning experience.Row as ex-exam chief says Welsh Bac is nonsense Wales On-line, 17 May 2011 However, Mr Jones' comments were challenged by David Evans, Wales Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, who said: \u201cI am surprised Jeff Jones has come out and made these statements several years after the event. If that\u2019s what he thought at the time, he should hang his head in shame for putting in a bid from the WJEC to run the Welsh Bac. Making these comments now smacks of scaremongering.\u201d "]}, {"page": "Bridgend County Borough Council", "response": ["| style=\"text-align: left;\" scope=\"row\" | Jeff Jones"]}, {"page": "Jeff Jones", "response": ["*Jeff Jones (musician) (born 1953), Canadian musician", "*Jeff Jones (hip hop musician), American musician", "*Jeff Jones (activist) (born 1947), American environmental activist", "*Jeff Jones (Welsh politician) (fl. 1996\u20132004)", "*Jeff Jones (cricketer, born 1941), Welsh cricketer who played for England", "*Jeff Jones (pitcher) (born 1956), American baseball player, also coach ", "*Jeff Jones (outfielder) (born 1957), American baseball player", "*Jeff Jones (Guyanese cricketer) (born 1958)", "*Jeff Jones (basketball) (born 1960), American basketball coach", "*Jeff Jones (American football) (born 1972), American football player with the 1995 Detroit Lions", "*Jeff Jones (music industry executive) (born c. 1950), American businessman", "*Jeff Jones (executive) (born 1968), American business executive, marketer and advertiser"]}, {"page": "2004 Bridgend County Borough Council election", "response": ["Labour had a strong majority on the council prior to the election, though council leader Jeff Jones had recently stood down from his position.
