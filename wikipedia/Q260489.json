Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.\" Some sentences were expected to run consecutively, and Harris was expected to serve half of his sentence in prison. He was told he must pay prosecution costs, though not compensation to the victims. The sentence was referred to the Attorney General Dominic Grieve after complaints that it was too lenient. On 30 July 2014, the new Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, announced that he would not be referring the sentence to the Court of Appeal for review \"as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it.
