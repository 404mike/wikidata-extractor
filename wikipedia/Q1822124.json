During World War II, Geoffrey Pyke proposed it as a candidate material for a supersized aircraft carrier for the British Royal Navy. Pykrete features unusual properties, including a relatively slow melting rate due to its low thermal conductivity, as well as a vastly improved strength and toughness compared to ordinary ice. These physical properties can make the material comparable to concrete, as long as the material is kept frozen.", "Geoffrey Pyke managed to convince Lord Mountbatten of the potential of his proposal (actually prior to the invention of pykrete) sometime around 1942, and trials were made at two locations in Alberta, Canada.  The idea for a ship made of ice impressed the United States and Canada enough that a -long, 1,000-ton ship was built in one month on Patricia Lake in the Canadian Rockies. However, it was constructed using plain ice (from the lake), before pykrete was proposed. It took slightly more than an entire summer to melt, but plain ice proved to be too weak. Pyke learned from a report by Herman Mark and his assistant that ice made from water mixed with wood fibres formed a strong solid mass\u2014much stronger than pure water ice. Max Perutz later recalled:", "A September 1943 proposal for making smaller pykrete vessels included the following table of characteristics:The National Archives, ADM 1/15677 \u2013 Proposals and inventions of Mr Geoffrey Pyke; gravity propelled ball bomb, pykrete and power driven rivers."]}, {"page": "Project Habakkuk", "response": ["Project Habakkuk or Habbakuk (spelling varies) was a plan by the British during the Second World War to construct an aircraft carrier out of pykrete (a mixture of wood pulp and ice) for use against German U-boats in the mid-Atlantic, which were beyond the flight range of land-based planes at that time. The idea came from Geoffrey Pyke, who worked for Combined Operations Headquarters.  After promising scale tests and the creation of a prototype on Patricia Lake, Jasper National Park, in Alberta, Canada, the project was shelved due to rising costs, added requirements, and the availability of longer-range aircraft and escort carriers which closed the Mid-Atlantic gap that the project was intended to address.", "Geoffrey Pyke was an old friend of J. D. Bernal and had been recommended to Lord Mountbatten, Chief of Combined Operations, by the cabinet minister Leopold Amery.

Bernal was able to argue on both sides of Project Habbakuk, Geoffrey Pyke's proposal to build huge aircraft landing platforms in the North Atlantic made of ice. He rescued Max Perutz from internment, getting him to perform experiments on ice related to Habbakuk in a meat store freezer below Smithfield Meat Market. This project indirectly marked his divergence from Zuckerman, when he was recalled from a joint tour of the Middle East investigating the co-operation of army and air force, but the tour established Zuckerman's reputation as a military scientist."]}, {"page": "Tim McInnerny", "response": ["|Geoffrey Pyke"]}, {"page": "Magnus Pyke", "response": ["* Geoffrey Pyke (first cousin)"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Nathaniel Pyke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey Pyke"]}, {"page": "Lionel Edward Pyke", "response": ["Lionel Edward Pyke (1854\u20131899) an English-Jewish barrister, born at Chatham, Kent, England on 21 April 1854 and died in Brighton, Sussex, England on 26 March 1899.

Pyke envisaged that the vehicles would be used by a small force of highly mobile soldiers. The damage and casualties that a small force could inflict might be slight, but they would oblige the enemy to keep many men stationed in Norway in order to guard against every possible point of attack. Pyke's ideas were initially rejected, but in October 1941, Louis Mountbatten became Chief of Combined Operations and Pyke's ideas received a more sympathetic hearing. Mountbatten became convinced that Pyke's plan was worthwhile and adopted it.
