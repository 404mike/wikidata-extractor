They supposedly formed in 1986 when Amelia Fletcher and Elizabeth Price, both wearing Pastels badges, met at a club in Oxford. Their original line-up comprised Amelia Fletcher (vocals, guitar, principal songwriter), her younger brother Mathew Fletcher (drums), Peter Momtchiloff (lead guitar), Rob Pursey (bass) and Elizabeth Price (vocals). Pursey left early on, to be replaced by Chris Scott.", "For their third single, the group returned to a song they had first recorded in session for Janice Long's show on Radio 1 in August 1986, \"Talulah Gosh\". Elizabeth Price left toward the end of the year to form The Carousel with Razorcuts frontman Gregory Webster, and so the single, released on 30 May 1987, was the first to feature replacement Eithne Farry (vocals, tambourine). The single was less shambolic than their earlier offerings, and a video was made for it which was played on The Chart Show (then shown on Channel 4), giving the band some mainstream exposure. The single was produced (some critics suggested it was over-produced) by John Rivers, as was the follow-up \"Bringing Up Baby\", a sophisticated pop song that reduced the band's \"shambling\" element to the point where mainstream success seemed a possibility. Indeed, The Primitives would later take precisely this route to success \u2013 but Talulah Gosh never made the national chart. The ironically-titled debut (compilation) album Rock Legends: Volume 69 was released in October 1987, collecting tracks from the earlier singles and radio sessions.", "January 1988 saw not only the release of \"Bringing Up Baby\" but also the broadcast of a second Radio 1 session, this time for DJ John Peel. What was to be Talulah Gosh's last single, a punk thrash titled \"Testcard Girl\" (very loosely based on an old Heinz advertising jingle), was released in May. The group split later that year.  A posthumous collection of BBC radio sessions was issued by Sarah Records in 1991, and a more comprehensive retrospective was released on K Records in 1996. A limited edition EP of demos, recorded in 1986, was issued for Record Store Day in 2011, at which point a new retrospective album was also announced, at that time to be called Grrrr. On 22 July 2013, Amelia Fletcher announced on her Facebook page that the album, now called Was It Just a Dream?, would be released in October 2013. It was launched along with a DJ set by Amelia Fletcher, Eithne Farry and Elizabeth Price at the London club Scared To Dance."]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Elizabeth Price (born 1966) \u2013 2012 Turner Prize winner"]}, {"page": "Paul Noble", "response": ["Paul Noble (born 1963) is a British visual artist.
