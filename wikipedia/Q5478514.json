It tells the story of Rhodes' life through a series of flashbacks of conversations between him and Princess Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and also between her and people who knew him. It also shows the story of how she stalked and eventually ruined him. In the serial, Cecil Rhodes is played by Martin Shaw, the younger Cecil Rhodes is played by his son Joe Shaw, and Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 is played by Frances Barber. In the serial Rhodes is portrayed as ruthless and greedy. The serial also suggests that he was homosexual. Countering the implication of Rhodes' homosexuality, historian and journalist Paul Johnson wrote that Rhodes had been falsely smeared by the programme, commenting: \"In nine tendentious hours, Rhodes is to be presented as a corrupt and greedy money-grabber, a racist and paedophile, whose disgusting passion was to get his hands on young boys ... the BBC has spent \u00a310m of our money putting together a farrago of exaggerations and smears about this great man.\" Peter Godwin said of the film that \"it feels like a work overwhelmingly informed by malice, consistently seizing on the very worst interpretation of the man without really attempting to get under his skin. Rhodes was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn't so much a freak as a man of his time.\""]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Still Crazy || Columbia Pictures || Brian Gibson (director); Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais (screenplay); Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Bill Nighy, Juliet Aubrey, Helena Bergstr\u00f6m, Bruce Robinson, Hans Matheson, Lee Williams, Rachael Stirling, Alphonsia Emmanuel, Phil Daniels, Zoe Ball, Frances Barber, Rupert Penry-Jones || Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1999 in film", "response": ["| Still Crazy || Columbia Pictures || Brian Gibson (director); Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais (screenplay); Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Bill Nighy, Juliet Aubrey, Helena Bergstrom, Bruce Robinson, Hans Matheson, Lee Williams, Rachael Stirling, Alphonsia Emmanuel, Phil Daniels, Zoe Ball, Frances Barber, Rupert Penry-Jones || Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "Agatha Christie's Poirot", "response": ["!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Frances Barber"]}, {"page": "1988 in film", "response": ["*We Think the World of You, directed by Colin Gregg, starring Gary Oldman, Alan Bates, Max Hall, Liz Smith, and Frances Barber"]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| A Zed & Two Noughts || Artificial Eye / Channel Four Films || Peter Greenaway (director/screenplay); Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol, Brian Deacon, Eric Deacon, Frances Barber, Joss Ackland || Comedy, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Trevor Nunn", "response": ["In 2007, he directed the RSC productions of King Lear and The Seagull, which played at Stratford before embarking on a world tour (including the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and then playing at the New London Theatre from November 2007.
