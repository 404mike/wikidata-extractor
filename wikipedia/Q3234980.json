He is the older brother of fellow professional footballer Richard Eckersley.\nHe started his career with Manchester United in 2004, but failed to break into the first team in his four years there and was loaned out to Royal Antwerp, Br\u00f8ndby, Barnsley and Port Vale, before joining Port Vale permanently in 2008. Later that year, he transferred to Danish club AC Horsens. In 2010, he moved on to AGF Aarhus.

He returned to Scotland 12 months later to play for St Mirren, helping the club to the Scottish Championship title at the end of the 2017\u201318 season.

On 5 November, Farsley Celtic manager Lee Sinnott was appointed as the new Vale boss. This decision caused Dean Glover to consider his position at the club, though he eventually chose to remain as Sinnott's assistant. Sinnott warned of big changes at the club. Young defender Charlie O'Loughlin was then loaned out to Nantwich Town, and Shane Tudor was sent out on loan to Shrewsbury Town. Arriving at the club were midfielders Mark Salmon (Wolverhampton Wanderers) and Marc Laird (Manchester City) on short loan deals.", "In January, goalkeeper Mark Goodlad was forced to retire due to injury, and young Joe Anyon faced criticism from the fans for his performances. Adam Eckersley then returned to the club after his release from Manchester United, as Sinnott's first non-loan signing. Sinnott then signed Dave Mulligan from Scunthorpe United on a short-term contract. Midfielder David Howland also arrived on loan from Birmingham City, and would join the club permanently at the end of the season. Fellow Birmingham player Krystian Pearce also signed on loan, though would impress enough to win a longer stay with Birmingham. Sinnott then raided another Birmingham club, this time Aston Villa, to bring Australian teenager Chris Herd on a one-month loan, as well as Swedish youngster Tobias Mikaelsson. He also allowed Rocastle to join Gillingham on a two-week loan. Sinnott also completed the signings of Chasetown pair Chris Slater and Kyle Perry, who left their jobs to become full-time professional footballers. In February, O'Loughlin was loaned out to Hinckley United. After the club lost a 2\u20130 lead at Victoria Park to lose 3\u20132 against Hartlepool United, club legend Jon McCarthy questioned the team's mental strength. In April, Craig Rocastle's contract was terminated by mutual consent, and he moved to play for Greek club Thrasyvoulos.

Sinnott claimed this cull was necessary to turn the club around. Danny Whitaker rejected Vale's contract offer, and their revised offer, to move off to Oldham Athletic.
