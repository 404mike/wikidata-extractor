Prior to 2015, Beckford, from Enfield, London, competed for England and Great Britain.\nIn October 2010 he was part of the team which won the silver medal for England in the gymnastics in the men's artistic all-around team event at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. He also won the silver medal in the men's individual all-around event and a silver medal in the men's floor event at the same games.Born in England with a Jamaican father, Beckford announced his decision to switch allegiance to Jamaica, a move considered likely to increase his chances of qualification for the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016.Beckford competed at the 2015 World Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow. He and his two teammates were the first Jamaican men to do this. He did not qualify to any finals but placed high enough to qualify a Jamaican man to the Rio Test Event in April 2016 to try to qualify to the Olympic Games. However Beckford was unable to take this place at the qualifying event himself because the rules state a gymnast must not have competed for another country in the past three years. Beckford last represented Great Britain in 2014. This meant he missed out on the Rio Olympic Games but could still be the first Jamaican male gymnast to compete at an Olympics if he qualifies to Tokyo 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1992 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 17 February \u2013 Reiss Beckford, gymnast"]}, {"page": "England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|  || EnglandReiss BeckfordTariq DowersSteve JehuDanny LawrenceMax Whitlock || Gymnastics || Men's artistic team all-around || 4 October"]}, {"page": "2010 European Men's Artistic Gymnastics Championships", "response": ["| Oldest|| Reiss Beckford ||  United Kingdom || 17/02/92 || 18 years"]}, {"page": "Gymnastics at the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Max WhitlockLuke FolwellDanny LawrenceReiss BeckfordSteve Jehu"]}, {"page": "October 2010 in sports", "response": ["****Floor exercise:  Thomas Pichler  14.675 points  Reiss Beckford  14.625  Ashish Kumar  14.475", "***Men's individual all-around:  Luke Folwell  85.550 points  Reiss Beckford  85.450  Joshua Jefferis  84.750"]}, {"page": "England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games (medalists)", "response": ["|  || EnglandReiss Beckford, Tariq Dowers, Steve Jehu, Danny Lawrence & Max Whitlock || Gymnastics || Men's artistic team all-around || 4 October"]}, {"page": "England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games (B\u2013R)", "response": ["| Reiss Beckford", "| Reiss Beckford", "| Reiss Beckford", "| Reiss Beckford", "| Reiss Beckford", "| Reiss Beckford", "| Reiss Beckford"]}, {"page": "2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships \u2013 Men's qualification", "response": ["|80||align=left| Reiss Beckford||||6.000 14.066 (77)||5.300 13.333 (113)||6.000 14.200 (62)||5.600 13.733 (166)||5.400 13.566 (152)||6.400 12.900 (156)||81.798"]}, {"page": "2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Reiss Beckford"]}, {"page": "Scott Hann", "response": ["Scott Denny Hann, MBE (born 26 June 1980) is an English gymnastics coach, currently serving as the Director of Coaching for the South Essex Gymnastics Club in Basildon, Essex.
