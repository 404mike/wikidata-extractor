She conducted research in India in the late 1920s and early 1930s on macrocytic anaemia of pregnancy, a disease which is characterized by enlarged red blood cells and is life-threatening.Pregnant women in the tropics with inadequate diets are particularly susceptible. Wills discovered a nutritional factor in yeast that both prevents and cures this disorder. This component, the so-called 'Wills Factor', was subsequently shown to be folate, the naturally occurring form of folic acid.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marmite", "response": ["During the 1930s, Marmite was used by the English scientist Lucy Wills to successfully treat a form of anaemia in mill workers in Bombay. She later identified folic acid as the active ingredient. Marmite was used to treat malnutrition by Suriya-Mal workers during the 1934\u20135 malaria epidemic in Sri Lanka. Housewives were encouraged to spread Marmite thinly and to \"use it sparingly just now\" because of limited rations of the product."]}, {"page": "Folate", "response": ["In the 1920s, scientists believed folate deficiency and anemia were the same condition. In 1931, researcher Lucy Wills made a key observation that led to the identification of folate as the nutrient required to prevent anemia during pregnancy. Wills demonstrated that anemia could be reversed with brewer's yeast. In the late 1930s, folate was identified as the corrective substance in brewer's yeast. It was first isolated via extraction from spinach leaves by Herschel K. Mitchell, Esmond E. Snell, and Roger J. Williams in 1941. The term \"folic\" is from the Latin word  (which means leaf) because it was found in dark-green leafy vegetables. Historic names included L.casei, factor vitamin Bc after research done in chicks and vitamin M after research done in monkeys."]}, {"page": "B vitamins", "response": ["| Folic acid || Lucy Wills||1933||"]}, {"page": "Yellapragada Subbarow", "response": ["At Lederle, he developed a method to synthesize folic acid, Vitamin B9, based on work by Lucy Wills to isolate folic acid as a protective agent against anemia. After his work on folic acid and with considerable input from Dr. Sidney Farber, he developed the important anti-cancer drug methotrexate \u2013 one of the first cancer chemotherapy agents and still in widespread clinical use.Farber et al.'s article, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1946, noted Dr Subbarao's work as a foundation for this landmark paper. The paper remains one of the earliest top-cited research articles and is a classic in the field of medicine. Subbarao also discovered the basis for the anthelmintic diethylcarbamazine (Hetrazan), which was used by the World health Organization against filariasis.World Health Organization. (2002).

Geneva"]}, {"page": "History of cancer chemotherapy", "response": ["Shortly after World War II, a second approach to drug therapy of cancer began. Sidney Farber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School, studied the effects of folic acid on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a vitamin crucial for DNA metabolism  (the significance of DNA was not known at that time), had been discovered by Lucy Wills, when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), Farber used folate analogues synthesized by Harriett Kiltie and Yellapragada Subbarow of Lederle Laboratories. These analogues \u2014 first aminopterin and then amethopterin (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear \u2014 antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. Farber met resistance to conducting his studies at a time when the commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the children should be allowed to die in peace. Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the New England Journal of Medicine was met with incredulity and ridicule."]}, {"page": "Cheltenham Ladies' College", "response": ["*Lucy Wills, haematologist"]}, {"page": "London School of Medicine for Women", "response": ["* Lucy Wills, discovered nutritional factor in yeast (folate), which prevented macrocytic anaemia in pregnancy."]}, {"page": "Wills", "response": ["* Lucy Wills (1888\u20131964), English haematologist"]}, {"page": "1931 in science", "response": ["* Lucy Wills, working in India, demonstrates that anemia in pregnancy can be reversed using brewer's yeast."]}, {"page": "Leonard Johnston Wills", "response": ["Thus his Cambridge career lasted from his going up to King\u2019s in 1903 until the end of his Fellowship in 1915.  During this period there were several family connections with Cambridge.  The younger of his two sisters, Lucy Wills, a pioneer in the field of haematology, went up to Newnham College in 1907; she later discovered the role of folate, one of the B vitamins, in preventing anemia in pregnancy. Their younger brother Alfred Gordon went up (also to King\u2019s) in 1910.
