She conducted research in India in the late 1920s and early 1930s on macrocytic anaemia of pregnancy, a disease which is characterized by enlarged red blood cells and is life-threatening.Pregnant women in the tropics with inadequate diets are particularly susceptible. Wills discovered a nutritional factor in yeast that both prevents and cures this disorder. This component, the so-called 'Wills Factor', was subsequently shown to be folate, the naturally occurring form of folic acid.", "link_mentions": {}}}
