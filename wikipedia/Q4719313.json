The king wears a long beard, a short waist-cloth or dhoti, a waistband or kammarband, and a shoulder garment or uparna whose ends hang down the back. Besides the earrings he is adorned with bracelets armlets and anklets and a large ornament hangs across the chest from the left shoulder to the right hip. The right hand is held near the chest in the act of granting protection; and the left hand holds something which cannot be made out. By his side is the umbrella-bearer and five other attendants. The statue closely resembles the lifesize figure of a king of the Chaulukya period lying in the yard of a temple at Maliya about twenty-four miles north of Somnath. At Somnath are similar but less rich contemporary figures of local officers of the Chaulukyas. Another similar figure of which only the torso remains is the statue of Anr\u00e1ja the father of Vastupala in a niche in Vastup\u00e1la\u2019s temple at Girn\u00e1r.
