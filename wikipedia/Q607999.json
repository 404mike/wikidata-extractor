Despite the numerous production problems encountered during this period, the second album, Fugazi, built upon the success of the first album with a more streamlined hard rock sound.

Clay proposed a Camel reunion tour; Ward supported the scheme but Peter Bardens was the only other former member to show interest. Clay then enlisted some former members of Caravan and attempted to promote the band as a legitimate new lineup of Camel, but a copyright challenge from Latimer forced a name change. Under the name Mirage, this group conducted a short tour in late 1994 and released a live album. The members of Mirage were never compensated, and Clay's fraudulent practices were addressed in a 1995 song by Caravan. Also under Clay's management, Bardens led another band under the name Mirage that released a live album in 1996. Clay also sold counterfeit Camel merchandise, and several years later was convicted of fraud and forgery.
