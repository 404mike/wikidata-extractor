By the early 1850s, John 'Tiny' Wells, George Fordham, John Charlton, Henry Custance and brothers James and Luke Snowden were coming to the fore, all able to ride at 7 stone 7\u00a0lbs (47.6\u00a0kg).  During his prime, Flatman had ridden at 7 stone 8\u00a0lbs (48.1\u00a0kg) but he could no longer compete at this weight.  John Wells was the first to overhaul Flatman in the jockeys championship in 1853. By 1854, both Wells and Charlton had headed him, and from then on Flatman gradually fell out of favour until in his final year of riding in 1859, he won only fifteen races."]}, {"page": "City and Suburban Handicap", "response": ["|Henry Custance"]}, {"page": "Custance", "response": ["*Henry Custance, British jockey."]}, {"page": "Harry Custance", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Custance"]}, {"page": "Ralph Bullock (jockey)", "response": ["The highlight of his short career was the 1861 Derby, which he won on Kettledrum for owner Charles Townley. The Epsom course itself had been badly neglected and was strewn with rubbish on the day of the race. In the event, Kettledrum was a luck winner. The favourite, Dundee, ridden by Henry Custance looked like he would win easily at Tattenham Corner, but eighty yards from the winning post, the horse broke down badly on both forelegs and Kettledrum won by a neck. Bullock would also finish second in the Oaks on Lady Ripon. Riding Kettledrum in the Doncaster Cup later that year, he scored a memorable dead heat with the filly that had won the Oaks, Brown Duchess."]}, {"page": "John Daley (jockey)", "response": ["He was booked to ride Hermit in the 1867 Derby after the horse had broken a blood vessel in a training gallop and the intended jockey Henry Custance was released to ride The Rake. Daley was paid \u00a3100, with the promise of another \u00a3100 if he could get the horse placed, \u00a33,000 if he won. Daley brought Hermit for a late run, on the orders of trainer Captain Machell, and won by a neck from Marksman in the final strides. Two days later he added the Oaks on Hippia for Rothschild."]}]}}
