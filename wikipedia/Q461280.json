She has represented Great Britain at six Olympics from 1992 to 2012, winning team silver in 2004 and 2012, and team bronze in 2008. At the World Equestrian Games, she won team gold in 1994 and 2010, and team silver in 2006. She has also won four team golds and one team bronze medal at the European Eventing Championships.\nKing's individual honours include European bronze in 1995 and European Silver in 2007. She is a four-time British Open Champion (1990, 1991, 1996 and 2007). She won the CCI four star Badminton Horse Trials in 1992 and 2000, the CCI four star Burghley Horse Trials in 1996, and the CCI four star Rolex Kentucky with her homebred mare King's Temptress in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eventing", "response": ["In the early years, the dressage phase was fairly inconsequential in determining the final standings. It was quite possible for a horse to have a terrible dressage test, then run a clean cross-country and show jumping, and still finish near the top of the standings. Since then, correct dressage training has become increasingly important should a horse and rider wish to be placed (complete all sections and finish in the top 12). This can be traced back to Sheila Willcox, who took a particular interest in dressage, becoming abundantly clear when she won Badminton three years running in the 1950s. She had a strong influence on Mary King and Lucinda Green amongst others."]}, {"page": "Newark-on-Trent", "response": ["*Mary King (born Thomson, 1961) \u2013 Olympic equestrian sportswoman"]}, {"page": "Equestrian at the 2004 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|Jeanette Brakewell  on Over To You Mary King  on King Solomon IIILeslie Law  on Shear L'EauPippa Funnell  on Primmore's PrideWilliam Fox-Pitt  on Tamarillo"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Mary King", "|align=left|Jeanette BrakewellWilliam Fox-PittPippa FunnellMary KingLeslie Law"]}, {"page": "Mary King", "response": ["Mary King may refer to:", "*Mary King (political scientist), professor at the University of Peace, author and non-violence activist (a.k.a.
