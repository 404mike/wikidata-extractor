Hilda found out first but Eddie, was unsure how to tell Marion the truth, had copied the keys and started meeting Marion there regularly. Mike found out when he found post and phone messages for Eddie, but he let Eddie meet Marion there one last time to tell her the truth. To Eddie's relief, the truth made Marion even more attracted to him, as she had been having doubts that they were right for each other due to his supposed wealth. When he realised he was in love with her, Eddie told Marion about his time in prison and when she accepted it, he proposed to her. They got engaged but Marion did not want to marry immediately. After a few months, Marion's ex-boyfriend, Phil Moss (Ken Kitson), turned up to try to win her back. Thinking he might not be good enough and feeling jealous, Eddie ended their engagement and Marion left but returned to tell Eddie that she wanted him.
