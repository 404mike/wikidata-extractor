James had to balance his European responses carefully, because England's key ally, the Duke of Burgundy was also in possession of the Low Countries, a major trading partner of Scotland's at the time, and therefore James's support for France was muted.Grant, Independence and Nationhood, p.49 The truce with England expired in May 1436 but James's perception of the Anglo-French conflict changed following a realignment of the combatants. The breakdown of the talks between England and France in 1435 precipitated an alliance between Burgundy and France and a request from France for Scottish involvement in the war and for the fulfillment of the promised marriage of Princess Margaret to the Dauphin.Brown,James I, p.162 In the spring of 1436 Princess Margaret sailed to France and in August Scotland entered the war with James leading a large army to lay siege to the English enclave of Roxburgh Castle. The campaign was to prove pivotal, the Book of Pluscarden describes ' a detestable split and most unworthy difference arising from jealosy ' within the Scottish camp and the historian Michael Brown explains that a contemporary source has James appointing his young and inexperienced cousin Robert Stewart of Atholl as the constable of the host ahead of the experienced march wardens, the earls of Douglas and Angus. Brown explains that both earls possessed considerable local interests and that the effects of such a large army living off the land may have created considerable resentment and hostility in the area. When the militant prelates of York and Durham together with the Earl of Northumberland took their forces into the marches to relieve the fortress, the Scots swiftly retreated\u2014a chronicle written a year later said that the Scots 'had fled wretchedly and ignominiously'\u2014but what is certain is that the effects and the manner of the defeat and the loss of their expensive artillery was a major reversal for James both in terms of foreign policy and internal authority.Brown, James I, pp.164\u20135Grant,Independence and Nationhood, p.50", "Michael Brown describes James as an 'able, aggressive and opportunistic politician' whose chief aim was to establish a monarchy that had stature and was free from the confrontations that had beset his father's reign. He characterises James as 'capable of highly effective short-term interventions' yet had failed to achieve a position of unqualified authority. Brown writes that James had come to power after 'fifty years when kings looked like magnates and magnates acted like kings' and succeeded in completely changing the outlook and objectives of the monarchy. His policy of reducing the power and influence of the magnates, continued by his son James II, led to a more subordinate nobility.Brown, James I, pp.\u00a0207\u20138 Alexander Grant repudiates James's reputation as the 'law giver' and explains that nearly all of the king's legislation were reconstructions of laws laid down by previous monarchs and concludes that 'the idea of James's return in 1424 marks a turning point in the development of Scots law is an exaggeration'.Grant, Independence and Nationhood, pp.\u00a0189\u2013190 At James's death only the Douglases of the predominant magnate houses was left and, according to Grant, this reduction was the most far-reaching change to the nobility and was 'by far the most important consequence of James I's reign'.Grant, Independence and Nationhood, p.\u00a0191"]}, {"page": "University of St Andrews", "response": ["*Michael Brown"]}, {"page": "Michael Brown", "response": ["* Michael Brown (physicist) (born 1946), Vice-Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University", "* Michael Brown (historian) (born 1965), Scottish historian", "* Michael Brown (writer), (1920\u20132014), American composer, lyricist, writer, director, producer, and performer", "* Michael Brown (rock musician) (1949\u20132015), American keyboardist and songwriter", "* Michael Ealy (Michael Brown, born 1973), American actor", "* Michael Brown (film director) (born 1978), American documentary filmmaker", "* Michael Brown (pianist) (born 1987), American classical pianist and composer", "* G.

In a lost MacDowall charter, witnessed by Robert Keith and datable to 1412, he was said to have been in his seventh year of consecration.Dowden, Bishops, p. 367; Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 274; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. Nothing more is known about Elisaeus's career as Bishop of Galloway; the time of his death is not known either, but he died sometime before 14 June 1415, when there occurs the earliest evidence that a successor for Galloway was needed.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131."]}]}}
