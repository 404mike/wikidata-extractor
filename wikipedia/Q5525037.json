As an amateur, he won the Brabazon Trophy in 1990 and 1991 (shared both times), and represented Great Britain & Ireland in the 1991 Walker Cup. He turned professional later that year.\nEvans earned membership of the European Tour on his first visit to the qualifying school. He was a consistent performer on the European Tour throughout his career, finishing inside the top 100 on the Order Of Merit every season he played from 1992 through 2004 (he missed the 1995 season with a wrist injury), with a best of 21st place in 2002. Back and shoulder problems which eventually required surgery brought a premature end to his 2005 season, and he retired at the end of 2006 having never won a tournament on the European Tour.The highlight of Evans' career came at the 2002 Open Championship at Muirfield where he was in contention on the final day and finished in a tie for fifth place, just one stroke outside the four man play-off, eventually won by Ernie Els.Two years later, at the 2004 Open, Evans became only the seventh golfer in the long history of the competition to record an albatross (double eagle), on the fourth hole at Royal Troon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vijay Singh", "response": ["| Gary Evans"]}, {"page": "Turespa\u00f1a Masters", "response": ["| 1992 ||  Vijay Singh || align=center|277 || align=center|\u221211 || 2 strokes ||  Gary Evans"]}, {"page": "Olivier Edmond", "response": ["Edmond was born in Paris.
