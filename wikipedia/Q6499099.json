In the initial 2017 judgment, the High Court ordered that the words \"or belief\" be \"read in\" to references to religion in marriage law to allow humanists to conduct legally binding humanist marriages; a similar decision was taken by the Scottish Registrar General in 2005. In 2018, the Court of Appeal said that refusing humanists legal marriage rights was unlawful discrimination, but quashed the order compelling a read-in, saying the state can avoid incompatibility by registering humanists to provide legal weddings as civil celebrants. Humanists UK celebrants in Northern Ireland became authorised to conduct legal marriages shortly after.
