The latter win led to a very emotional post-race interview with her brother. Her uncle Toby Balding trained winners in the Grand National, Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle. Furthermore, her maternal grandfather was the trainer Peter Hastings-Bass and her maternal uncle the 17th Earl of Huntingdon was once trainer to Queen Elizabeth II.

The Jockey Club refused to issue training licences to women until Florence Nagle won a court case in 1966, and so the licence was held by a series of male assistants.  While she continued to train the horses, the licence was officially held by Colonel Dick Poole, then Charles Jerdein, then her cousin Peter Walwyn, before her son Fulke Johnson Houghton took over in 1961. Her achievements were belatedly recognised by the Jockey Club in December 1977, when she was one of the first three women to be elected as a member, alongside Priscilla Hastings and Ruth Wood (n\u00e9e Primrose), Countess of Halifax."]}]}}
