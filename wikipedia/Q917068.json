He is also famous for early important works in quantum dimer models and resonating valence bond theory (with Daniel Rokhsar and others), for the first (bosonic) Chern-Simons field theory description of fractional quantum Hall effect and quantum Hall dualities (with Shoucheng Zhang, Hans Hansson, Dung-Hai Lee and others), and other important problems in fractional quantum Hall physics (with Jainendra K. Jain, Shivaji Sondhi and others). He has also made important contributions to the physics of polymers (with John Schrieffer, Alan J. Heeger and others), fullerenes (with Sudip Chakravarty and others), glasses and supercooled liquids (with Daniel Kivelson, Sudip Chakravarty, Zohar Nussinov and others), and, more recently, to in iron-based high-temperature superconductivity and problems involving nematicity, charge orders and superconductivity in general."]}, {"page": "Victor John Emery", "response": ["#REDIRECTVictor Emery"]}, {"page": "Emery, Victor", "response": ["#redirectVictor Emery"]}, {"page": "Eduardo Fradkin", "response": ["In his doctoral work at Stanford, he made major contributions to lattice gauge theories, where his results (separately with Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind) have, among other things, had far-reaching applications and implications to two-dimensional quantum spin liquids and other topologically ordered phases in two-dimensional lattices. He has done many important works in the area of fractional quantum Hall physics, in which he gave the first fermionic Chern-Simons field theory for the effect, described various field theories for non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states (with Chetan Nayak and others), quantum Hall edge physics and, more recently, theories for describing nematicity and geometry in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of his most influential works has been the introduction and elucidation of the powerful new paradigm in quantum many-body physics of electronic liquid crystalline phases in various strongly correlated systems (with Steven Kivelson and Victor Emery), in particular in quantum Hall systems and high-temperature superconductors, and, more recently in this area, elucidation of the notion and significance of \"intertwined orders\" in the context of cuprate high-temperature superconductors and more generally in strongly correlated systems (with Steven Kivelson and John Tranquada). He has also made important contributions to the physics of quantum dimer models (partly with Shivaji Sondhi and others), models for unconventional quantum phase transitions involving topologically ordered phases (with Paul Fendley and others), and quantum entanglement properties of these and related problems. He also gave one of the earliest approaches to higher dimensional bosonization of fermionic field theories (with Fidel Schaposnik) as well as two-dimensional Fermi surfaces (with his then student Antonio Castro-Neto) and has later applied them to important problems in condensed matter.
