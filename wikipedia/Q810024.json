According to historian Daniel Richter, Pontiac's Rebellion saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of \"the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other\".Richter, Facing East from Indian Country, p.\u00a0208 Basil Davidson states in his documentary, Africa: Different but Equal, that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas."]}, {"page": "Special Operations Executive", "response": ["Two missions subsequently dropped \"blind\" i.e. without prior arrangement for a reception party, failed.

Although he was never officially a member of the Communist Party, many of Strand's collaborators were either Party members (James Aldridge; Cesare Zavattini) or prominent socialist writers and activists (Basil Davidson). Many of his friends were also Communists or suspected of being so (Member of Parliament D. N. Pritt; film director Joseph Losey; Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid; actor Alex McCrindle). Strand was also closely involved with Frontier Films, one of more than 20 organizations that were identified as \"subversive\" and \"un-American\" by the US Attorney General.
