She returned to England in 1924 and resumed work at Guy's Hospital, while studying for her midwifery certification, which she attained in 1926. She was appointed as assistant matron at Guy's in 1931 and three years later, became the matron at Bethnal Green Hospital, which was overseen by the London County Council (LCC). In 1934, Dreyer became a naturalized British citizen. The following year, she was promoted to principal matron at Bethnal Green, become responsible for nursing administration. In 1940, after the previous Principal matron-in-charge, Dorothy Bannon died, Dreyer took over the post with the approval of the LCC. As this was at the beginning of World War II, there was a xenophobic movement to dismiss her, which the LCC rejected, reconfirming the appointment. During the war, she visited hospitals which had been bombed during The Blitz and assessed which should be evacuated. If she determined that a facility must be abandoned, she organized the removal and eventual return of patients, nurses and equipment.
