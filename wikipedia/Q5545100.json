He made a single appearance for Hampshire during the 1935 County Championship, scoring 0 and 21 in a home match against Lancashire. In the 1939 season with no other amateur available for more than a few matches, Taylor captained Hampshire, though he did not appear in the final few matches of the season when Giles Baring was available to play and was worth a place in the team on merit. The move to appoint Taylor as captain was not a success, and the team won only two out of 23 matches under his captaincy. In his obituary in the 1987 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, it was noted that he \"would never have claimed to be more than a club player\". He ended his career with 306 runs from 37 innings at an average of 9.27 and with a highest score of just 41, made in the match against Lancashire.A solicitor, Taylor died in Romsey, Hampshire in 1986 at the age of 76.", "link_mentions": {}}}
