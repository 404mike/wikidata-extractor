He made a single appearance for Hampshire during the 1935 County Championship, scoring 0 and 21 in a home match against Lancashire. In the 1939 season with no other amateur available for more than a few matches, Taylor captained Hampshire, though he did not appear in the final few matches of the season when Giles Baring was available to play and was worth a place in the team on merit. The move to appoint Taylor as captain was not a success, and the team won only two out of 23 matches under his captaincy. In his obituary in the 1987 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, it was noted that he \"would never have claimed to be more than a club player\". He ended his career with 306 runs from 37 innings at an average of 9.27 and with a highest score of just 41, made in the match against Lancashire.A solicitor, Taylor died in Romsey, Hampshire in 1986 at the age of 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Taylor", "response": ["George Taylor may refer to:", "*George Taylor (Alamo defender) (c. 1816\u20131836), soldier in Texas army, died in the Battle of the Alamo", "*George Taylor (British Army officer) (1905\u20131994), served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Mau Mau campaign", "*George Taylor (Medal of Honor) (1830\u20131893), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*George Taylor (Canadian politician) (1840\u20131919), Canadian House of Commons member", "*George Taylor (Pennsylvania politician) (c. 1716\u20131781), signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence", "*George Taylor (New York Representative) (1820\u20131894), American Congressman from New York", "*George Taylor (Connecticut politician) (1802\u20131881), politician and physician", "*George Taylor (Australian politician) (1861\u20131935), Australian labour leader and member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia", "*George Taylor (Australian rules footballer) (1876\u20131953), Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne", "*George Taylor (manager) (1853\u20131911), American baseball manager", "*George Taylor (cricketer) (1909\u20131986), English cricket player", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131982), played in the Football League for Brentford and Millwall", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u2013?), English football outside right, who played for Coventry City F.C. in the 1930s", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u2013?), English football left half", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20131982), Scottish footballer, played for Aberdeen and Plymouth Argyle", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1920) (1920\u20131983), English football goalkeeper, played for West Ham United", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1948), Scottish footballer, played for Grimsby Town", "*George Taylor (Negro leagues) (1869\u2013?), Negro leagues first baseman", "*George Taylor (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s, 1910s and 1920s", "*George Taylor (DC Comics), fictional character in the DC Comics universe, chief editor of the Daily Star", "*George Taylor (artist) (1914\u20131996), English commercial artist", "*Sir George Taylor (botanist) (1904\u20131993), British botanist, from 1956 to 1971 director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew", "*George Taylor (gardener) (1803\u20131891), introduced celery to the United States", "*George Taylor (priest) (died 1811), Anglican priest", "*Taylor (Planet of the Apes), Colonel George Taylor, fictional hero of the first two films of the original Planet of the Apes series played by Charlton Heston"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire cricket captains", "response": ["*  George Taylor 1939"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*George Taylor, cricketer, was born in Havant"]}]}}
