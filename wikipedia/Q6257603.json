He managed to get past the enemy's steamboats at the entrance of Careening Bay, but was prevented from getting further by a long string of boats carrying enemy troops. He made a second attempt on 16 August but although both these actions were unsuccessful, they were boldly conceived and carried out in the face of great danger.John Sheppard was only the fourth person to be awarded the Victoria Cross, and the first from Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. He later achieved the rank of Boatswain First Class.\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boatswain", "response": ["A number of boatswains and naval boatswains mates have achieved fame.
