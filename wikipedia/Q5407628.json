Bennett was a pupil of Marling School from 1905 to 1908 having gained a scholarship from Uplands School, Stroud.\nBennett was 24 years old, and a Temporary Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The Worcestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when on 5 November 1916 near Le Transloy France the deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.\nThe award citation published in the London Gazette reads:\n\nTemporary Lieutenant Bennett, of the Worcestershire Regiment, when in command of the second wave of the attack, found that the first wave had suffered heavy casualties. Its commander had been killed and the second line was wavering. Lieutenant Bennett advanced at the head of the second wave and by his personal example of valour and resolution reached his objective with but sixty men. Isolated with his small party, he at once took steps to consolidate his position, under heavy rifle and machine gun fire from both flanks, and although wounded, he remained in command, directing and controlling. He set an example of cheerfulness and resolution beyond all praise, and there is little doubt that, but for his personal example of courage, the attack would have been checked at the outset.\nBennett first served in the ranks of the Artists' Rifles and later achieved the rank of captain.  After World War I he became a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1923, then serving as Prosecuting Counsel from 1931 to 1935 and a Metropolitan Magistrate from 1935 to his retirement in 1961. During World War II he served as an officer in the Air Training Corps of the RAF. He retired to Vicenza, in northern Italy, where he died at the age of 77. \nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Worcestershire Regiment collection in the Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum in Worcester, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Artists Rifles", "response": ["*Lt Eugene Paul Bennett, 2nd Battalion, The Worcestershire Regiment"]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| Eugene Paul Bennett || British Army || 1916 || First World War || Le Transloy"]}, {"page": "Eugene Bennett", "response": ["* Eugene Paul Bennett (1892\u20131970), British soldier and Victoria Cross recipient"]}, {"page": "Royal Artillery Memorial", "response": ["Jagger at that time was preoccupied with the Anglo-Belgian Memorial in Brussels and did not begin work on the Royal Artillery memorial until October, at which point he made several changes to the proposed design, which he submitted to the RAWCF early the following year. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger rotated the howitzer by 90 degrees, bringing it into line with the main axis of the base, pointing towards the Wellington Arch. After much discussion\u2014including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield representing the Royal Fine Arts Commission\u2014Jagger agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. The change also resolved an objection raised by the King about the \"gloomy\" figure on the front of the memorial staring down Constitution Hill towards Buckingham Palace. A year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay.Curl, p.94.Bowdler and Brindle, p.31. Jagger made another change in early 1924, adding an effigy of a dead soldier to the fourth side of the memorial, in keeping with the soldiers on the other three sides. The proposal proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier at eye level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials\u2014architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification.King, p.135. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan, and practical problems on the site itself.Curl, pp.94\u201395. The names of his models for three of the statues are known\u2014William Fosten for the driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the ammunition carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger, for the commander.Bowdler and Brindle, p.33.Black (2004b), p.161Windrow, p.11."]}, {"page": "Marling School", "response": ["* Eugene Paul Bennett, VC - Soldier"]}]}}
