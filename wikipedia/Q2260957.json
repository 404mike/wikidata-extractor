Some actors' salaries were leaked in 2006, revealing that Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Fowler) was paid \u00a3150,000, Cliff Parisi (Minty Peterson) received \u00a3220,000, Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) and Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) each received \u00a3360,000 and Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler) had a salary of \u00a3370,000.
