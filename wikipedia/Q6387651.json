He was selected to play for the Third Division North representative side in 1954\u201355.\nIn 1964, as Workington's player-manager, he led them into the Third Division and left to become player-manager at Watford where he remained for several years, winning promotion to the Second Division for the first time in the club's history in 1969, and reaching the FA Cup semi-final a year later. He moved to Blackburn Rovers as manager in 1971 for two seasons before being announced as the new manager of Sheffield United on 9 December 1973.\nDespite financial difficulties due to the building of the new South Stand, he led United to sixth place in the First Division; a 0\u20130 draw away to Birmingham City on the last day of the 1974\u201375 season left them just one point short of a UEFA Cup place. However, the following season started disastrously with just one win from 11 games and his contract was terminated on 6 October 1975. Furphy left for America to manage the New York Cosmos (1975\u201376) in the NASL. He also coached the Miami Toros (1976\u201377), the Detroit Express (1977\u201380) and the Washington Diplomats (1981). He has also managed the national team of Bermuda and the Cleveland Force.\nDuring the 2000\u201301 season he was appointed as Technical Director of Exeter City, to help then manager Noel Blake as the club battled against relegation; this tenure was short-lived, and he left the club after just six days in the job.\nHe also worked for BBC Radio Devon's sports department, commentating on local football matches.\nHe coached his son, former NASL and MISL player Keith Furphy, while both were in Detroit.\nFurphy died on 17 January 2015 in a care home in Dawlish, where he had dementia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 17", "response": ["*2015 \u2013 Ken Furphy, English footballer and manager (b. 1931)"]}, {"page": "Watford F.C.", "response": ["McGarry joined Ipswich in 1964, and was replaced by player-manager Ken Furphy, from Workington Furphy rebuilt the team around players such as Keith Eddy and Dennis Bond, but after holding Liverpool to a draw in the FA Cup and narrowly failing to win promotion in 1966\u201367, Bond was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a330,000, Watford's record transfer receipt at the time.Jones 1996, p. 43.

After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watford's following three managers presided over improved teams. Ron Burgess led Watford to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1959\u201360. Bill McGarry was only in charge for one full season (1963\u201364), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the Third Division, the club's highest Football League finish until that point. His successor Ken Furphy matched that achievement in 1966\u201367, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, before taking the club to its first FA Cup semi-final in 1970.

He initially did well but the team was ageing and there was little money to replace players.  After a good finish in his first season a disastrous string of results the following year led to Furphy being sacked in October 1975. Jimmy Sirrel was recruited from Notts County but he proved unpopular with both the players and fans and could not halt the decline, overseeing relegation and then being sacked in September 1977 with United at the bottom of Division Two. The ambitious and colourful Harry Haslam was handed the reigns and although many of his ideas were ahead of their time he built an ageing side based on 'star' players at the end of their career. Now in the Third Division performances deteriorated still further and Haslam stepped down due to illness in January 1981. World Cup winner and then United player Martin Peters was promoted to the position of manager but United were relegated to Division Four at the end of the season and Peters resigned."]}, {"page": "New York Cosmos (1970\u20131985)", "response": ["Although New York finished third at season end, it was still too low a placing to reach the post-season. Bradley was replaced for the 1976 season by another Englishman, Ken Furphy, who paired Pel\u00e9 up front with Italian international forward Giorgio Chinaglia, a new arrival from S.S. Lazio. He had been so popular at Lazio that when his move to New York was announced, supporters \"threatened to throw themselves beneath the wheels of the plane\". By contrast to most of the overseas stars bought by NASL teams, Chinaglia was signed in his prime. He played for the Cosmos for the rest of their history, scoring a record number of goals and points not only for the Cosmos, but for the entire league. He shared an unusual personal bond with the club's ultimate controller, Ross, and was therefore treated differently from the other players, including Pel\u00e9.", "The New York Cosmos' first head coach was the English-American professional Gordon Bradley, who had played in the English Football League's lower divisions during the 1950s before moving to America in 1963. Bradley came out of retirement to become player-coach, a role he retained until his departure in 1975. Bradley's team won the league championship in 1972, but after it failed to reach the playoffs in both 1974 and 1975, he was dismissed. His replacement was another Englishman, Ken Furphy. His Cosmos succeeded in reaching the post-season, but lost the divisional championship game to Vancouver, prompting Furphy's own departure in favor of a return for Bradley, whose second spell lasted only half a season before he was promoted to an advisory role. Eddie Firmani, the South African-born former Italy forward, took over midway through the 1977 season. His star-studded team won two consecutive Soccer Bowls\u20141977 and 1978\u2014but lost the National Conference championship game in 1979. Firmani lost his job after falling out with Giorgio Chinaglia, a favorite of the Cosmos hierarchy.
