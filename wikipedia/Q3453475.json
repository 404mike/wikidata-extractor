Hitzlsperger left Aston Villa as a fan favourite, and stated that he might return to the club when the opportunity comes.

The departure of manager Gary Megson, Hoult returning to West Brom and further injury to Paul Gerrard presented Pedersen with another chance. Pedersen performed well in the eyes of many Forest fans and contributed to a resurgence in form which saw Forest climb to within two points of a play-off berth by the end of the season. The appointment of Colin Calderwood as the new manager of Nottingham Forest in June 2006 and the arrival of Southampton goalkeeper Paul Smith limited Rune to just a handful of appearances during the 2006-07 season.
