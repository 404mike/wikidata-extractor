There was a point in time in the early 20th century that the firm had two 'Tai-pans' at the same time, one in Hong Kong and one in Shanghai, to effectively manage the firm's extensive affairs in both locations. Both tai-pans were responsible only to the senior partner or proprietor in London who was normally a retired former tai-pan and an elder member of the Jardine family.", "Today, the Jardine Matheson Group is still very much active in Hong Kong, being one of the largest conglomerates in Hong Kong and its largest employer, second only to the government. Several landmarks in present-day Hong Kong are named after the firm and the founders Jardine and Matheson like Jardine's Bazaar, Jardine's Crescent, Jardine's Bridge, Jardine's Lookout, Yee Wo Street, Matheson Street, Jardine House and the Noon Day Gun.  In 1947, a secret Trust was formed by members of the family to retain effective control over the company.  Jardine, Matheson and Co. offered its shares to the public in 1961 under the tenure of Hugh Barton and was oversubscribed 56 times. The Keswick family, in consortium with several London-based banks and financial institutions, bought out the controlling shares of the Buchanan-Jardine family in 1959, but subsequently sold most of the shares during the 1961 public offering, retaining only about 10% of the company.

In 1980, Jardine was outbid by shipping magnate Sir Yue-Kong Pao for the Hongkong & Kowloon Wharf & Godown Company in which the two groups had previously shared control when the latter decided to diversify from ships into property. The Hongkong Land, a development company established in 1889 by William Keswick's brother James Johnstone Keswick, faced consistent threat from Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings and nearly went bust in the early 1980s. When he discovered a secret buyer had begun acquiring shares of Jardine Matheson stock in late 1980, many observers suspected that either Li or Pao (or worse, both) were attempting to purchase a large enough share in Jardine Matheson to win control over Hongkong Land. Newbigging announced in early November that Jardine Matheson and Hongkong Land had agreed to increase their interests in each other, so as to make it impossible for any party to gain control of either company. The cross-ownership scheme, however, placed both companies deeply into debt. The defensive actions required during 1980 forced Jardine Matheson to sell its interest in Reunion Properties to raise cash. Newbigging was criticised for being too conservative and placing too much emphasis on local and regional operations. Keswick family also saw it as a chance to remove Newbigging from office. Newbigging finally stepped down as senior managing director in June 1983, but retained the titular position of chairman. He was replaced as taipan by 40-year-old Simon Keswick, brother of Henry Keswick."]}, {"page": "Simon Lindley Keswick", "response": ["#REDIRECT Simon Keswick"]}]}}
