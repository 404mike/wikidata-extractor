Subsequently, Common Purpose and the Government Equalities Office set up The About Time Public Leaders Courses, designed to support the government's aim to increase the diversity of public-body board members and the pool of talented individuals ready to take up public appointments. The schemes were formally launched in January 2010. In January 2010, Common Purpose Chief Executive, Julia Middleton, published interviews with 12 leaders from the private, public and voluntary sectors, including Sir David Bell and Dame Suzi Leather about the qualities needed for good leadership in challenging times.", "A number of UK national newspapers ran stories implying that Common Purpose had exerted improper influence over the Leveson Inquiry, in the days preceding publication of its report. These stories centred on the role of Inquiry member Sir David Bell, who was both a trustee of Common Purpose, and had set up the Media Standards Trust (a lobbying group which presented evidence to the Inquiry) together with Julia Middleton. Moreover, the Media Standards Trust set up and provided funding for the lobbying group Hacked Off, which also presented evidence to the Inquiry. Bell resigned from the Media Standards Trust when he was appointed a member of the Inquiry. On 25 November, The Daily Telegraph too published a comment piece on CPUK, noting that the Rotherham Director of Children's Services, Joyce Thacker, heavily criticised in the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, was a member of CPUK, and noting that Common Purpose had been described as \"[a] secretive Fabian organisation [\u2026 that] has been described as a Left-wing version of the Freemasons.\"", "Writing in The Guardian, Roy Greenslade described the Mail coverage of Common Purpose in general, and the central focus on Sir David Bell in particular, as \"a classic example of conspiracist innuendo\" and went on that \"through a series of leaps of logic and phoney 'revelations' of Bell's publicly acknowledged positions, the articles persistently insinuate that he has been up to no good.\" This opinion was shared in an article in the New Statesman by Peter Wilby. Also in The Guardian, Michael White acknowledged that, \"anti-establishment bodies should be as much fair game for accountability as those of the old establishment\", but said: \"I couldn't help thinking as I read it that the analysis itself is a bit of a conspiracy. Delete 'Common Purpose' throughout and insert 'Jew', 'Etonian' or 'Freemason' and you'd rightly feel uneasy.\""]}, {"page": "Media Standards Trust", "response": ["In light of the June 2011 allegations of the News of the World journalists phone hacking into the mobile phone voice mail of murder victim Milly Dowler, on 5 July 2011 in partnership with Brian Cathcart and other concerned individuals, MST formed the \"Hacked Off\" campaign, registering the site hackinginquiry.org, and campaigning for a public inquiry into phone hacking.
