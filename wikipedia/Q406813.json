This species is thought to have arisen from a hybrid between the rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and either the grey whitebeam (S. rupicola) or grey whitebeam (S. porrigentiformis). It is part of a group of closely related species within the genus Sorbus which have leaves with deep lobes and small fruits, this group includes English whitebeam (S. anglica), least whitebeam (S. minima) and the Arran whitebeam (S. arranensis)."]}]}}
