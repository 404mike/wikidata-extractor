Social simulation uses computers to create an artificial laboratory for the study of complex social systems; data-mining uses machine intelligence to search for non-trivial patterns of relations in large, complex, real-world databases. The emerging methods of socionics are a variant of computational sociology.Gilbert, Nigel and Klaus G. Troitzsch (2005). Simulation for Social Scientists, 2nd Edition.

This has been used primarily for modeling or building explanations of social processes and are depending on the emergence of complex behavior from simple activities.Salgado, Mauricio, and Nigel Gilbert. \"Emergence and communication in computational sociology.\" Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 43.1 (2013): 87-110.  The idea behind emergence is that properties of any bigger system do not always have to be properties of the components that the system is made of.Macy, Michael W., and Robert Willer. \"From factors to actors: computational sociology and agent-based modeling.\" Annual review of sociology 28.1 (2002): 143-166.  Alexander, Morgan, and Broad, classical emergentists, introduced the idea of emergence in the early 20th century. The aim of this method was to find a good enough accommodation between two different and extreme ontologies, which were reductionist materialism and dualism. ", "This cellular automata paradigm gave rise to a third wave of social simulation emphasizing agent-based modeling. Like micro-simulations, these models emphasized bottom-up designs but adopted four key assumptions that diverged from microsimulation: autonomy, interdependency, simple rules, and adaptive behavior. Agent-based models are less concerned with predictive accuracy and instead emphasize theoretical development. In 1981, mathematician and political scientist Robert Axelrod and evolutionary biologist W.D. Hamilton published a major paper in Science titled \"The Evolution of Cooperation\" which used an agent-based modeling approach to demonstrate how social cooperation based upon reciprocity can be established and stabilized in a prisoner's dilemma game when agents followed simple rules of self-interest. Axelrod and Hamilton demonstrated that individual agents following a simple rule set of (1) cooperate on the first turn and (2) thereafter replicate the partner's previous action were able to develop \"norms\" of cooperation and sanctioning in the absence of canonical sociological constructs such as demographics, values, religion, and culture as preconditions or mediators of cooperation. Throughout the 1990s, scholars like William Sims Bainbridge, Kathleen Carley, Michael Macy,  and John Skvoretz developed multi-agent-based models of generalized reciprocity, prejudice, social influence, and organizational information processing.
