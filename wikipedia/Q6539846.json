He suffered a concussion that kept him out of the game against Zebre on 1 November, but returned to the starting line-up for the Scarlets' two Anglo-Welsh Cup matches that month, before dropping to the bench for the Pro12 game against Glasgow on 21 November, and only after Regan King had been injured in the pre-match warm-up. He was on the bench again for the first two games of 2015, and was forced into an extended cameo in the second match against Glasgow after Liam Williams suffered a shoulder injury early in the second half, and started in place of Williams in the next match away to Leicester Tigers in the Champions Cup the following week. Full-back duties were assigned to Steven Shingler, Josh Lewis and Kristian Phillips for the next three games, but Williams started the next five during the 2015 Six Nations Championship, scoring a try in the first of those in a 32\u201314 home win over Connacht on 15 February after making an interception on his own goal line, and another in a 23\u201313 win at home to Leinster on 7 March. A shoulder injury that required surgery brought an early end to Williams' season. During the season, Williams also played three times for Carmarthen Quins in the British and Irish Cup, scoring one try against Jersey Reds."]}]}}
