While not the fastest European U20 women's result, officially it was also European junior record, breaking 1988 Birte Bruhns' mark of 1:59.17. At the end of June, she defended her British title at the national championships which doubled up as the Olympic trial event, sealing a place on the Great Britain's Olympic team. She clocked 1:59.61 outsprinting experienced Scottish runners duo Jemma Reekie and Laura Muir in the final 100 metres with a second lap in 57.5s. A week later on 4 July, Hodgkinson further lowered her PB by almost 1.4 seconds to 1m 57.51s, finishing fourth at the Diamond League meet in Stockholm. She became the second-fastest European U20 woman and the third-fastest UK woman of all time at the event, setting the British U23 record."]}]}}
