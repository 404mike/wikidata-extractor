In November 2012, midway through recording the follow-up in Los Angeles with The Hooves of Destiny, the crisis broke out. \"When I listened back to what we\u2019d recorded, I didn't see any of myself in it\u2026 None of it was angry, none of it was sad. I wasn't being true to myself,\" the singer said, speaking to The Observer. She broke up the band and ditched her name, opting for a different sound, described as \"spiky, propulsive\" and \"exhilarating.\" This drastic move had been preceded by a breakdown she had in the summer of 2012 in a Zurich hotel room, during a European tour. \"I felt my head go. It was the scariest thing. It felt like my brain was melting,\" Houghton remembered.  After several months of dieting and meditating she completely recovered.", "\"This is a new sound, a new project. Du Blonde is a new incarnation and one step closer to assuming my ultimate form. Having freed myself from the rusty and bloody shackles of Beth Jeans Houghton \u2013 both musically and spiritually \u2013 I felt it only right to step forth under a new name and let the rituals commence,\" Houghton stated, explaining the moniker conversion. Asked what has prevented her from playing louder on Yours Truly, Cellophane Nose, Du Blonde said: \"I think a lot of it had to do with the way I learnt how to write and play guitar. I taught myself, and therefore had no concept of time signatures and keys, so often my songs would turn out pretty experimental because, well, they were experiments\u2026 Due to the complex or odd nature of the songs I was writing, putting distortion on things just didn\u2019t work. To make the best of a raw, overdriven sound, I needed to keep it simple, which is only something I learned once I had a better grasp on chord progressions and rhythms.\"", "\"While she possesses a silvery voice that would sound right at home on album after album of Yours Truly's ethereal folk-pop, her transformation from Beth Jeans Houghton's soap bubble iridescence to Du Blonde's biker jacket toughness is surprisingly effective,\" writes Allmusic. \"While something suggests Houghton isn't done surprising her listeners, Welcome Back to Milk is so intriguing that they'll be impatient to hear whatever she has to offer,\" reviewer Heather Phares suggested."]}, {"page": "Yours Truly, Cellophane Nose", "response": ["Yours Truly, Cellophane Nose is the debut studio album by Beth Jeans Houghton recorded with the Hooves of Destiny and released in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2012 (on 28 February 2012 in the United States), by Mute Records.
