In the meeting, King allegedly urged Mountbatten to become the leader of a government of national salvation.

This much had already been confirmed by former cabinet secretary Lord Hunt, who concluded in a secret inquiry conducted in 1996 that \"there is absolutely no doubt at all that a few, a very few, malcontents in MI5\u00a0... a lot of them like Peter Wright who were right-wing, malicious and had serious personal grudges \u2013 gave vent to these and spread damaging malicious stories about that Labour government.\""]}, {"page": "Industrial espionage", "response": ["Some of these activities were directed via the East German Stasi (Ministry for State Security).
