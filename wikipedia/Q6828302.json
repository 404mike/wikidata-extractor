The series was very similar to the Double Deckers, and essentially acted as a blueprint for the latter. Like the Double Deckers, Six and a Half centred on the adventures of seven children, who had similar personalities to the characters in Double Deckers. Many of the crew members from the Six and a Half series also worked on the Double Deckers, including producer Roy Simpson, director and writer Harry Booth, writer Glyn Jones, and choreographer Arnold Taraborrelli (who designed the title cards for Six and a Half). In addition, future Double Deckers cast members Brinsley Forde and Michael Audreson were among the stars of Six and a Half, and Melvyn Hayes appeared in a few episodes. Six and a Half also featured several gags and plotlines that would later be reused in Double Deckers."]}, {"page": "List of British former child actors", "response": ["*Michael Audreson (born 1956)"]}, {"page": "List of The Tomorrow People serials", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" | Guest Cast: Olu Jacobs (General Papa Minn), Michael Audreson (Flynn), Jackie Cowper (Sula), Eric Roberts (Major Marcos), David Graham (The Puppet Voices)"]}, {"page": "The Magnificent Six and 1/2", "response": ["The first series of The Magnificent Six and 1/2 starred Len Jones as the group's leader, Steve, Brinsley Forde as prankster Toby, Suzanne Togni as tomboy Liz, Ian Ellis as rather large Dumbo, Michael Audreson as the clever Whizz, Lionel Hawkes as the always hungry Stodger, and Kim Tallmadge as tag-a-long Peewee (the \"1/2\" in the serial's title).
