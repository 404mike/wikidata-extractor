George Allen came with the idea of Zool as he was criticized on his previous game Switchblade II for having a lack of enemies. In development, Zool could cast spells to get him out of trouble by collecting potions. For example, Zool could escape from pits with high jump spells and cast a shadow spell to make a clone of him that follows his actions (thus doubling the fire power). In the final version, the spells were replaced with collectible power-ups. The very early name for the project was Pootz. The soundtrack by Patrick Phelan overlaps with the Lotus 3 soundtrack and inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. The game was heavily hyped upon its initial release, including being bundled with the then-newly launched Amiga 1200, although not the AGA version with enhanced graphics which followed later. In 2000, the Amiga version of Zool was re-released as part of The Best of Gremlin compilation.", "Category:Video games scored by Patrick Phelan"]}, {"page": "Zool 2", "response": ["Zool 2 was created by a new development team at The Warp Factory, whose programming staff involved personnel that previously worked on Harlequin for Gremlin Graphics, with only composer Patrick Phelan returning from the original Zool crew as George Allan, Adrian Carless and Tony Dawson did not return to work on the sequel.
