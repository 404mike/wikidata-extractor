Dykes migrated to the Anglo-Catholic, ritualist, wing of the Church of England during his Cambridge years. Although never a member of the Cambridge Camden Society, his later life showed him to be clearly in sympathy with its central tenets, as he was with those of the Oxford Movement.Cory, infra He was a member of the Society of the Holy Cross. At this time, antagonism between the evangelical and Anglo-Catholic wings of the Church of England was heated and sometimes violent.Cory, infra The seminal case concerned the Brighton-based Rev. John Purchas (1823\u201372) who, as a consequence of a Privy Council judgment which bore his name, was compelled to desist from such practices as facing east during the celebration of Holy Communion, using wafer bread, and wearing vestments other than cassock and surplice. Another clergyman, the London-based Alexander Mackonochie (whose worship style Lord Shaftesbury had characterised as being \"in outward form and ritual\u2026the worship of Jupiter or Juno\")W.A.J. Archbold, Mackonochie, \"Alexander Heriot\" in Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Vol. 35. was pursued through the courts until the pressure proved too much and he resigned his living in 1882.Cory, p. 81 Although Dykes's treatment at the hands of the evangelical party, which included his own Bishop, Charles Baring, was largely played out locally, Baring's refusal to license a curate to help the overworked Dykes in his ever-expanding parish, led the latter to seek from the Court of Queen's Bench a writ of mandamus, requiring the Bishop to do so. Against the expectations of many senior legal figures, including the Attorney-General, Dr. A. J. Stephens, Q.C., whose services Dykes had retained, the Court, led by puisne judge Sir Colin Blackburn, Q.C., refused to interfere in what they saw to be a matter of the Bishop's sole discretion.Cory, pp. 131 et. seq. Dykes's defeat was followed by a gradual deterioration in his physical and mental health, necessitating absence (which was to prove permanent) from St. Oswald's from March 1875. Rest and the bracing Swiss air proving unavailing, Dykes eventually went to recover on the south coast of England where, on 22 January 1876, he died aged 52.Fowler, p. 222. However, Fowler's assertionFowler, p. 212. that he died at St. Leonard's on Sea is false: he died in the asylum at Ticehurst, some 18 miles distant.Cory, p. 144. More significantly, his assertion that Dykes's ill-health was a consequence of overwork, exacerbated by his clash with Bishop Baring, has recently been questioned; one scholar suggests that the medical evidence points to his having succumbed to tertiary syphilis, and speculates that Dykes may have contracted the disease during his undergraduate years.Cory, pp.144-146 He is buried in the \u2018overflow\u2019 churchyard of St. Oswald's, a piece of land for whose acquisition and consecration he had been responsible a few years earlier.St. Oswald's Parish Church Minute Book, entry for 24 October 1872 Touchingly, he shares a grave with his youngest daughter, Mabel, who died, aged 10, of scarlet fever in 1870.

It encompassed disaffected groups such as the Chartists and Free Traders as well as militant Nonconformists. It was a temporary recourse even for some members of the Established Church, notably the High Church cleric Alexander Mackonochie, who wanted less interference from the state so that he could practice proscribed rituals. Some people, such as Richard Masheder, a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, noted that the movement had the potential to effect change well beyond religious affairs because of the symbiotic relationship between the Established Church and the upper levels of society, whereby each buttressed the position of the other. Disestablishment might remove the prop that legitimised the role of the aristocracy and indeed the monarchy itself. There was indeed a wave of support for a more democratic society at that time and Miall repeatedly attacked the mutuality of the relationship between church and the social elite, believing it to be a force for snobbery and a barrier to progress.

It was built with funds from John Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington,Bernard Palmer, Reverend Rebels: Five Victorian Clerics and their Fight Against Authority, (London, Darton, Longman & Todd, 1993), p.78 and designed by William Butterfield in 1859. Construction occurred between 1861 and 1862 in yellow and red stock bricks with stone dressings and tiled roofs. In 1862 Alexander Mackonochie became its first perpetual curate. He introduced a daily Eucharist, which featured Gregorian chant and significant ritual elements (e.g. the lighting of altar candles and the cleansing of eucharistic vessels at the altar). St Alban's was the first Anglican church to hold the three-hour devotion on Good Friday (in 1864) and one of the first to celebrate a Harvest Festival. Mackonochie also openly heard confessions. Mackonochie's pastoral ministry was typical of the 19th-century ritualist \"slum priest\". With his two curates, Arthur Stanton (who remained at the church until his death in 1913) and Edward Russell, and lay assistants he founded schools, soup kitchens, a working men's club, mothers' meetings, clothing funds and more. Though he remained until 1882 and remained as an assistant priest thereafter, he became known as \"the martyr of St Alban's\" from those making \"regular\" Low Church requests and moves to temper his ritualism.Michael Reynolds, Martyr of Ritualism: Father Mackonochie of St. Alban\u2019s, Holborn (London: Faber and Faber, 1965)"]}, {"page": "A.
