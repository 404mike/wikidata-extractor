She was the first female Thoroughbred horse trainer to win the Australian cups double, the Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup, with her mare Ethereal in 2001. Her efforts were recognised when she took out the Fred Hoysted Award for the Australian season's outstanding training performance.\nLaxon was born in Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales. Her early childhood was spent on a small farm run by her mother. Her father was away from home much of the time working as a ship's pilot. It was on the farm that Laxon developed a passion for horses through pony clubs, gymkhanas and showjumping.\nBefore emigrating to New Zealand around 1980, she spent time working with English trainer John L. Dunlop at his stables in Arundel, Sussex.\nIn New Zealand in 1983 she married trainer Laurie Laxon who had a large stable with many successful horses. She rode many of them in trackwork,  including Empire Rose who won the 1988 Melbourne Cup.
