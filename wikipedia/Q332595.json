Smith, in \"Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity\", suggested Lincoln's view of the government as expressed in the Gettysburg Address was influenced by the noted speech of Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster, the \"Second Reply to Hayne\", in which Webster famously thundered \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!\" Specifically, in this speech on January 26, 1830, before the United States Senate, Webster described the federal government as: \"made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people\", foreshadowing Lincoln's \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\". Webster himself may have been relying on earlier use of similar language. For example, John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton had employed similar phraseology in 1819: \"I am a man chosen for the people, by the people; and, if elected, I will do no other business than that of the people.\" See Broughton, John and Burdett, Francis. An Authentic Narrative of the Events of the Westminster Election, which Commenced on Saturday, February 13th, and Closed on Wednesday, March 3d, 1819  p. 105 (Published by R. Stodart, 1819). Webster also noted, \"This government, Sir, is the independent offspring of the popular will. It is not the creature of State legislatures; nay, more, if the whole truth must be told, the people brought it into existence, established it, and have hitherto supported it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties.\""]}, {"page": "William IV", "response": ["William IV had a short but eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the ascendancy of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated a reduction in the political influence of the Crown and of the King's influence over the electorate. During the reign of George\u00a0III, the King could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the electorate to vote in favour of the new administration. Such was the result of a dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the Fox-North Coalition, and in 1807, after the dismissal of Lord Grenville. But when William dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Sir Robert Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch's ability to influence the opinion of the electorate, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, \"I have my view of things, and I tell them to my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have done my duty.\"Recollections of John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton, quoted in Ziegler, p. 276."]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Westminster School", "response": ["*John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton (1786\u20131869), companion and ally of Byron"]}, {"page": "John Galt (novelist)", "response": ["During a subsequent trip to Europe, Galt met and befriended Lord Byron in Gibraltar.

He then embarked to London to pursue business plans, but these did not come to fruition and he took to writing. Galt wrote an account of his travels, which met with moderate success. Decades later, he would also publish the first full biography of Lord Byron. He also published the first biography of the painter Benjamin West, The Life and Studies of Benjamin West (1816, expanded 1820)."]}, {"page": "John Cam Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton"]}, {"page": "Hobhouse", "response": ["*John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton (1786\u20131869), British politician and memoirist"]}, {"page": "Sir John Cam Hobhouse", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton"]}, {"page": "John Cam Hobhouse", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton"]}]}}
