A committed socialist, he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP).\nBuchanan was vice-chairman of Glasgow Trades Council and sat on the City Council from 1919 to 1923. At the 1922 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Gorbals.\nBuchanan supported Home Rule for Scotland and he was associated with the Scottish Home Rule Association. In 1924 he introduced a Scottish Home Rule Bill but despite support from Scottish MPs it was talked out by the Opposition.In 1932, Buchanan became Chairman of the United Patternmakers Association of Great Britain, which he held for 16 years. He initially agreed with James Maxton's moving the ILP out of the mainstream Labour Party but decided to leave it to rejoin Labour in 1939.\nAt the 1945 general election, Buchanan retained the seat of Glasgow Gorbals and attained the largest increase in percentage of voters in recorded UK history. After the election, the new prime minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Buchanan as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. Buchanan also later served as Minister of Pensions.\nBuchanan resigned from Parliament in 1948 to take up the position of Chairman of the National Assistance Board and was succeeded by Alice Cullen, who had already succeeded him as the candidate for Glasgow Gorbals.\nHe died in 1955, at 64.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Buchanan (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Buchanan (1506\u20131582) was a Scottish humanist.", "George Buchanan may also refer to:", "*Sir George Buchanan (soldier) (died 1651), Scottish soldier during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms", "*Sir George Buchanan (physician) (1831\u20131895), Chief Medical Officer", "*Sir George Buchanan (diplomat) (1854\u20131924), British diplomat", "*George Buchanan (engineer, born 1790) (1790\u20131852), Scottish civil engineer and land surveyor", "*Sir George Buchanan (engineer, born 1865) (1865\u20131940), British civil engineer", "*George Buchanan (politician) (1890\u20131955), Scottish politician"]}, {"page": "David Kirkwood", "response": ["He served on the Glasgow Trade Council and was a member of the Clyde Workers' Committee (CWC), an organisation chaired by William Gallacher. The CWC grew out of the Clyde engineers' pay dispute of 1915. Until its effective suppression in early-1916, it organised shop floor opposition to the policies of the Ministry of Munitions with regard to Leaving Certificates and Dilution of Labour. Kirkwood was the convenor of shop stewards at Parkhead Forge of William Beardmore and Company, where, in January 1916; he helped to secure a dilution agreement. In March 1916, as a result of a strike related to the implementation of the dilution agreement, Kirkwood was arrested and deported from Glasgow to Edinburgh, an event which greatly increased his profile. He returned to Glasgow in 1917, and was employed as foreman at the Mile-End Shell Factory. In January 1919, Kirkwood was prominently associated with the 40 hours' Strike. Batoned and arrested at a riot in George Square, Glasgow, he was tried for incitement to riot and acquitted. At the 1922 general election, Kirkwood was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) Dumbarton Burghs. He had previously served for four years on Glasgow Town Council. On 9 May 1924 the Speaker of the House of Commons adjourned the debate when Kirkwood and James Maxton caused an uproar after the Opposition talked out George Buchanan's Scottish Home Rule Bill.Robert Keith Middlemas, The Clydesiders: A Left Wing Struggle for Parliamentary Power (London: Hutchinson, 1965), p. 165."]}, {"page": "Red Clydeside", "response": ["The aura of Red Clydeside grew as delegations of organised labour replaced the Liberal Party as the political formation most popular among the working class.
