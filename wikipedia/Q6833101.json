There appears to be a strong scientific consensus that industrialized civilization has emitted enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect causing global warming, yet debate rages primarily over the economic effects of limiting development. Michael Northcott, professor of ethics, says both issues will have to be dealt with: the reorientation of modern society toward recognizing the biological limits of the planet will not occur without a related quest for justice and the common good. Wogaman argues that the \"doctrine of creation creates a presumption in favor of environmental conservation\". Francis Schaeffer, evangelical theologian, said: \"We are called to treat nature personally.\" Northcott says the incarnation shows God loves material reality, not just spirit. Recent studies indicate American Christians have become polarized over these issues. \"For liberal Christians, the call to be a better steward is urgent, unequivocal, of the highest priority, and not to be subject to negotiation or compromise. For conservative Christians, however, the commitment to stewardship has become increasingly hemmed in with certain reservations and qualifications... Today, the official position of Southern Baptists, and of other conservative Christians, is indistinguishable from that of secular conservatives in the climate denial movement\"."]}, {"page": "Northcott", "response": ["*Michael Northcott (born 1955), British theologian and professor of Ethics"]}, {"page": "2010 UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships \u2013 Men's cross-country", "response": ["| 65 || 62 ||align=left| Michael Northcott ||align=left|  || 15.02.1981 || 30 || -2LAP"]}, {"page": "Northcott, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Northcott"]}]}}
