The year before, in 1961, she had married Antony Edmund Paton Walsh; they settled in Richmond, south-west London, and had one son and two daughters. In the early 1970s, Jill met John Rowe Townsend and they began an affair. She left her first husband only in 1986, when their youngest daughter turned 18. Antony did not want a divorce because of his Roman Catholic faith. Jill and Townsend were married only in 2004, after Antony's death on December 30, 2003. Townsend died in 2014. In February 2020, she met Nicholas Herbert, 3rd Baron Hemingford, and they married in September of that year.  She died a month later, in October, of kidney and heart failure in the hospital of Huntingdon, Cambridge.  She is survived by her third husband, as well as her brother Christopher Bliss, her children Edmund Paton Walsh, Margaret Paton Walsh, and Clare Murphy, and her three grandchildren."]}]}}
