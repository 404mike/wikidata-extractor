Two such cases exposed Acorah. Before the filming, Acorah had been fed misinformation twice about the non-existent ghosts of Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles by the show parapsychologist Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe under instruction from Karl Beattie. During the investigations, later broadcast, Acorah presented the information as fact and even behaved as though being possessed by the fictional ghosts. O'Keeffe later revealed in the Daily Mirror that Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles were anagrams of 'Derek Faker' and 'Derek Lies'. Even though O'Keeffe exposed Acorah, the paper also claimed that O'Keeffe had exposed the rest of the Most Haunted team. O'Keeffe later reported that he had been grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the article, and produced a response outlining his version of the show based on his observations and findings, saying he had exposed Derek Acorah and not the entirety of Most Haunted. The show's presenter, Yvette Fielding, said in an interview that she believes it was a fake possession.Metro UK, \"60 SECONDS: Yvette Fielding\" by James Ellis, The UK Metro, 30 October 2006, retrieved 2 November 2006.", "The show was reported in 2005 to Ofcom relating to Derek Acorah. Ofcom described the show as one \"where techniques are used which mean the audience is not necessarily in full possession of the facts\".
