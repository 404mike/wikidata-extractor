Frederica von Stade, he conceded, \"does sing uncommonly well, with some delicious veiled tone to convey Penelope's anguish\". But some of her music had had to be transposed into the wrong key, and she was too young to play Penelope plausibly. \"Penelope need not be portrayed as an old woman, but at least her face has been lined by the troubles of her life; Miss von Stade is far too attractive for us not to suspect that the suitors are after her body as well as the throne\". Ewerhart's Maureen Lehane was much more au fait with Monteverdi's phrasing and accentuation than von Stade, and more successful too at expressing Penelope's \"pathos and dignity\". Penelope's husband was also better sung on Ewerhart's LPs than on Leppard's. Ewerhart's Gerald English had a much better grasp of Monteverdi's idiom than Leppard's Richard Stilwell, and presented a Ulisse who was convincing in sounding as though his return to his homeland had refreshed his weary soul. Orchestrally, Leppard's London Philharmonic sounded heavy-handed after one had heard Ewerhart's smaller Santini Chamber band. The score that Leppard used on his album was the edition that he had assembled himself, and it had both good points and bad. He had addressed the lacunae in the opera's Vienna urtext with great skill, composing a missing ballet, for instance, that could easily be mistaken for one of Monteverdi's Scherzi Musicali. But he had written an aria for Penelope that sounded incongruous, and he had been unwise to recompose the scene in which Penelope's suitors take turns to try to bend Ulisse's bow. His use of a large orchestra was justifiable in principle - the earliest extant score of the opera had been found in Vienna, and Viennese court productions if the early 1600s were believed to have deployed a wide assortment of instruments. However, the way in which he used his resources was ill-judged. Much music for which Monteverdi had wanted only a simple bass continuo had been augmented with strings and brass. The result was that \"the expressive movement between recitative, arioso and aria is obscured ... and the music becomes monotonous\". Moreover, the richness of Leppard's orchestration diverted listeners' attention away from his singers and their words. Leppard's album was exciting, and would be welcomed by devotees of Glyndebourne, but Ewerhart's was definitely preferable.Arnold, Dennis: Gramophone, December 1980, p. 878"]}]}}
