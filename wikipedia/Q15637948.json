He was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. He was born at Selly Oak, Birmingham.\nOn paper, Bridge's first-class cricket career appears to have been a fairly long one; in practice, after his return from National Service he had three full seasons with mixed success from 1959 to 1961 and then a struggle with injury, illness and form that lasted for several further seasons until his last game in 1968.\nBridge made his debut at the age of 17 in a single match in 1955 and played in a few more first-team matches in 1956 before disappearing from first-class cricket for two years on National Service. He returned to Warwickshire in 1959 and after being omitted from the first team in the opening games was brought into the side before the end of May and then played regularly across the rest of the season. In June, bowling in tandem with his rival for the spinning role in the team, Geoffrey Hill, he took eight-second-innings Cambridge University wickets for 56 runs (11 for 109 in the match), and these remained the best bowling figures of his career. In the season as a whole, he took 85 wickets at an average of 22.60.  Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted \"the increased usefulness of Bridge... whose ability to keep a length when under heavy fire rendered him a great asset on easy pitches\".A year later, it was a much less happy tale for Bridge in 1960 that the 1961 edition of Wisden reported: \"The poor form of Bridge came as a great blow,\" it said. \"The county have not enjoyed the services of a reliable off-spinner since the War and it had been hoped that Bridge would fill the gap in the spinning strength left vacant since the reitrement [sic] of Hollies, but he fell so far below expectations that he could not keep his place in the side.\" In the 1960 season, Bridge's tally of wickets fell to 34 and their cost rose to 40.47 runs per wicket.Bridge returned to form in the 1961 season and had his best year in first-class cricket. He took 123 wickets at an average of 22.99. He was, Wisden recorded, \"the first spinner in the country to take a hundred wickets\". Against Glamorgan at the St Helen's cricket ground in Swansea, he took five for 48 and seven for 49 to finish with the best match figures of his career, 12 for 97, and was awarded his county cap after the game.That, however, was almost as far as Bridge's first-class cricket career went. He was ill in 1962 and could play in no more than six matches, and though there were occasional appearances in games over the next three seasons and a final one in 1968, he bowled fewer than 400 overs after the end of the 1961 season and took only 33 further wickets.Bridge's lower-order batting was occasionally useful in a team that was usually burdened with some genuine tail-enders: Roly Thompson, Ossie Wheatley and Albert Wright, for example. He passed 50 on three occasions in his career, with a highest score of 56 not out in the match against the 1959 Indian team, when he shared a seventh wicket partnership of 78 with Jackie Fox, whose 52 was the only half-century of his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Basil Bridge (1955\u20131968) : W.

The move was quite successful as all three took more 100 wickets each and Warwickshire rose nine places to third in the County Championship, though Wisden Cricketers' Almanack took the view that lack of variety in the attack was the reason the county had not won the title. Wright, with 116 wickets at an average of 21.31, was the leading wicket-taker of the three and, said Wisden, \"appeared the most dangerous and should improve\". Virtually all of Wright's career-best bowling was done in this 1962 season. Against Gloucestershire at Edgbaston, he took five for 100 and six for 91 to achieve a match analysis of 11 for 191. He bettered this later in the season with five for 87 and six for 58 \u2013 match figures of 11 for 145 \u2013 in the game against Surrey, also at Edgbaston, and these were the best match and innings figures of his career."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Hill (cricketer, born 1934)", "response": ["Hill was unable to maintain this early success. He was in the Warwickshire side for many of the early matches of the 1959 season, but wickets were fewer in number and also more expensive, and the off-spin of Basil Bridge was increasingly preferred as the spin option as the season wore on. His 30 wickets in 1959 cost 41.20 runs apiece, and there was no greater success in 1960 even though Bridge was out of form; at the end of the 1960 season, Hill left first-class cricket. Throughout his three years in first-class cricket, his batting was negligible, and he reached 20 in an innings only twice, with a top score of 23."]}, {"page": "Ronnie Miller", "response": ["The Warwickshire side that Miller played in was heavily dependent for bowling on the relentless reliability of the medium-paced Tom Cartwright and a succession of fast-medium seam bowlers of whom David Brown was the most illustrious. In 1961, Miller played alongside Basil Bridge's off-breaks, but Bridge's career stumbled through illness and injury, and from 1962 Warwickshire spin bowling was usually Miller, sometimes paired with a succession of part-time bowlers or transitory players. Between 1962 and 1965 he took around 50 wickets each season and contributed occasional useful runs towards the end of the batting order: his fielding was a strong suit and in 1963 he took 45 catches to finish second in the national figures for non-wicketkeeping fieldsmen. His best bowling figures also came in 1963: he took six Lancashire second-innings wickets in the game at Old Trafford, though he had not bowled at all in the first innings. His batting developed more slowly, but in 1965 he scored 502 first-class runs and averaged more than 15 runs an innings for the only time in his career. His career best score was 72, one of only three innings he made of 50 or more, and it came in the match against Worcestershire in 1965. He was never picked for a one-day match, where Warwickshire preferred to field an all-seam attack. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1997 states that \"his application never quite matched his natural gifts\" and also that he was barred from acting as nightwatchman by Warwickshire after being out hooking at fast bowler Fred Trueman."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Basil Bridge (1961) : W.
