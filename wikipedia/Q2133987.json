Textbooks of the time generally maintained the principle that the numerical value of a physical quantity is not meaningful or does not exist until it is measured. Prominent physicists associated with Copenhagen-type interpretations have included Lev Landau, Wolfgang Pauli, Rudolf Peierls, Asher Peres, L\u00e9on Rosenfeld, and Ray Streater."]}, {"page": "Wick rotation", "response": ["* Euclidean Gravity \u2014 a short note by Ray Streater on the \"Euclidean Gravity\" programme."]}, {"page": "Stephen B.
