At introduction into service its cruise Mach Number was 0.88/ 380 kn IAS. Designed for high speed, with a critical Mach number of 0.93, the wing produced relatively limited lift at lower speeds. This, and the aircraft's low thrust-to-weight ratio, called for prolonged takeoff runs. Nevertheless, the Trident fulfilled BEA's  field length criterion and its relatively staid airfield performance was deemed adequate before the arrival into service of the Boeing 727 and later jet airliners built to  field length criteria.\"Talking to Mr. Beall: Boeing's Senior Vice-President in London.\" Flight International, 14 October 1960, p. 603.
