They focused on the speech of \"educated speakers of northern France\".;  This book was written for English learners of French as well; it provided the first comprehensive description of French intonation. French intonation was also analyzed in terms of tunes; it was a configuration-based approach, where intonation consists of a sequence of discrete pitch contours. French intonation essentially consists of three contours in their analysis, namely: rise-falling, falling, and rising. Armstrong and Coustenoble made use of a prosodic unit known as a Sense Group, which they defined as \"each of the smallest groups of grammatically related words into which many sentences may be divided\"., quoted in . The book also provides discussion of English intonation in order to demonstrate how French intonation differs. One contemporary review noted that \"it seems to have received a favourable reception\" in England. The book contained numerous exercises, which led to another reviewer calling it \"an excellent teaching manual\" as well. Oxford linguist Alfred Ewert called the book \"very useful\" in 1936, Austrian philologist Elise Richter called it \"an admirable achievement\" in 1938, and American linguist Robert A. Hall, Jr. called the book \"excellent\" in 1946. It has been later described as \"highly idealized\" for being based on conventions of reading French prose out loud. It is considered to be a \"classic work on French intonation\"."]}, {"page": "Rebecca Posner", "response": ["In 1949, Posner won an open exhibition to study modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford.
