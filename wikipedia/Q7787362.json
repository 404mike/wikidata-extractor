Salford Hundred, one of the four traditional divisions of Lancashire, was centered on Manchester.

Their attitude differed from other, more credulous magistrates.Alan Booth, The United Englishmen and Radical Politics in the Industrial North-West of England, 1795\u20131803, International Review of Social History Vol. 31, No. 3 (1986), pp. 271\u2013297, at p. 272.
