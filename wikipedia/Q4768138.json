It is most commonly associated with host Bob Monkhouse, but three other presenters also fronted the show. Hostess Anne Aston was on hand to read out the scores achieved by the contestants, and each month a \"Maid of the Month\", usually a glamour model of the era, would demonstrate the prizes and announce the contestants. When Bob Monkhouse returned to present the show in 1974, he was joined by co-hostess (to Anne Aston) Wei Wei Wong, recently seen in The Man with the Golden Gun and an ex-member of the Young Generation and Second Generation dance troupes. This was one of the earliest regular appearances by an East Asian woman on British TV.", "The next host was comedian and entertainer Norman Vaughan, who was assisted by regular hostess Anne Aston and for several months \"Maid of the Month\" Cherri Gilham. In theory, Norman Vaughan was an ideal host for the show but the pressure of the live show seemed to overwhelm him and he was never as confident a host as Monkhouse. Audience figures began to drop and in late 1973, he was replaced by comedian (and former footballer) Charlie Williams along with hostess Wendy King. Williams, of Barbadian ancestry on his father's side and Yorkshire on his mother's side, was rather a novelty on British TV at the time, being a black man with a broad Yorkshire accent. Despite his cheerfulness and amiability he proved unsuited to handling the pressure of a live TV show where things frequently went wrong. After six months, Williams was also replaced."]}, {"page": "There's a Girl in My Soup (play)", "response": ["The show was directed by Bob Chetwyn and the first cast featured Donald Sinden, Barbara Ferris, Jon Pertwee and Clive Francis. The producer was Michael Codron. The record-breaking success of the show put Codron on the map as a producer. In June 1967 the role of Robert Danvers was taken over by Gerald Flood, who played the role until December 1968, when Peter Byrne took over the role until 1970, when Charles 'Bud' Tingwell played the part until the show closed. The role of Andrew Hunter was played by William Franklyn, who was succeeded in June 1968 by Richard Coleman. The role of Marion was played by Belinda Carroll. In 1969 the play transferred to the Comedy Theatre, starring Peter Byrne, Karen Kessey and Richard Coleman. Karen Kessey played Marion for two years, never missing a performance.  Later the production starred Charles Tingwell, Gay Singleton and Richard Coleman. Richard Coleman understudied the role of Robert Danvers and played the part occasionally, when required to do so.  The play was taken out on a tour of the UK in 1973, with Danvers reprised by Gerald Flood, who ultimately played the role for over 650 performances. During the tour Andrew was played by Laurence Payne and John Hart Dyke and Marion was portrayed by Katy Manning and Anne Aston."]}, {"page": "Sue Longhurst", "response": ["Longhurst's first film of 1974 was The Over-Amorous Artist, but she also had supporting roles in comedy sketch shows with Dick Emery and Charlie Drake as well as small parts in sitcoms like Please Sir. For a brief time she was also a hostess on ITV gameshow The Golden Shot where she appeared with celebrity guests Barbara Windsor and Sid James, replacing \"dizzy\" Anne Aston. She also features briefly in the Hylda Baker sitcom Not On Your Nellie (1974), in an episode entitled \"The Apartment\" in which Baker's character has to stay in the Chelsea flat of a famous model (Longhurst).  While Longhurst's character never actually appears in the episode, photos of her (specially taken for the episode) are used as props, and feature heavily in the apartment set."]}, {"page": "Ann Lloyd", "response": ["*Anne Aston, n\u00e9e Lloyd, British actress"]}, {"page": "Going a Bundle", "response": ["Going A Bundle was a Southern TV children's television series hosted by Harry Fowler and Kenny Lynch shown between 1974 and 1976 .
