The family then purchased some land near Chongjin and built up an estate called Novina (after their clan name but also meaning new place). Yuri (now increasingly better known as George) managed this as farm and as a resort which became very successful, attracting many Russian exiles in Korea and their friends. The family later also ran a second resort called Lukomorie closer to the coast. The brothers continued to breed Sika and reindeer, hunt, and grow ginseng. Yuri became a famous tiger hunter and wrote several books. All the children learned to ride horses and hunt. When the Japanese took over Korea, the family earned a living by supplying fresh meat from the forests and from their farm. When the Soviets invaded northern Korea in 1945, Yuri was arrested by the NKVD and the lands taken away. Yuri was sent to the Gulags where he died in 1956. A biography of George Yankovsky was published as The tiger's claw (1956) by Mary Linley Taylor.
