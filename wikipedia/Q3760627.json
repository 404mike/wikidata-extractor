These seeds were distributed to a number of gardens, and by 1835 three gardens had successfully raised plants to flowering: the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the garden of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, and that of Henry Berens of Sidcup. In that year, the second of these was painted by Sarah Drake, and included as Plate 1728 in Edwards's Botanical Register. In the accompanying text, John Lindley identified the plant as B.\u00a0speciosa (Showy Banksia), but commented \"We found neither the whiteness of the under side of the leaves, nor the faintness of the veins, which are supposed to be characteristic of the species\". Doubts were raised about the identity of the species in 1857, when Walter Hood Fitch painted B.\u00a0victoriae based on a cut flower provided by David Moore of Glasnevin Botanical Garden. Fitch's painting appeared as Plate 4906 in Volume 82 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and was accompanied by the text: \"There can, I think, be no doubt of its being the same with the B.\u00a0speciosa above quoted in the Bot. Reg., but not the B.\u00a0speciosa of Br. and Hook., Bot. Mag. t. 3052; and equally certain does it appear to be the B.\u00a0Victori\u00e6 of Meisner.\" Thus it was implied that 1835 plate was in fact B.\u00a0victoriae, a suggestion that was supported by George Bentham in his treatment of the species in his 1870 Flora Australiensis."]}, {"page": "Algernon Percy, 1st Earl of Beverley", "response": ["*George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland (1778\u20131867)"]}, {"page": "Edward Littleton, 2nd Baron Hatherton", "response": ["Lord Hatherton married Lady Margaret Percy, second daughter of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, in 1841.
