Kendall wrote the screenplay for Atlantic the first sound portrayal of the Titanic Disaster. Kendall worked for several British studios and production companies but spent most of his screenwriting career with the large British International Pictures organisation where he wrote scripts for several of the companies leading directors such as Ewald Andr\u00e9 Dupont and Thomas Bentley. According to IMDb, this was the same person who proceeded to an acting career in the United States, commencing as one of the not-specifically named (and distinctly mature-looking) \"Students\" in the 1939 Laurel and Hardy film A Chump at Oxford. Other films through to 1943 in which an actor of this name appeared are listed in the same source. Against this background, it might be noted that there are no England and Wales birth records for any Victor Kendall in 1903, no sign of emigration to the United States in the 1930s, and no evidence of a person with such a name and approximate date of birth in the 1940 US Census. In that context, the lack of information on the death of this film-industry worker looks unsurprising.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Chump at Oxford", "response": ["* Victor Kendall as Student"]}, {"page": "My Son, My Son!", "response": ["* Victor Kendall as Pogson"]}, {"page": "Law of the Jungle (film)", "response": ["*Victor Kendall as Grozman"]}, {"page": "Kendall, Victor", "response": ["#redirectVictor Kendall"]}]}}
