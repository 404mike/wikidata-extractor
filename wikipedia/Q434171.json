In a career spanning more than 40 years, he composed at least 29 operas, almost 250 songs, several cantatas and other works.

The singer Victor Maurel sent him a French libretto based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Verdi liked it, but replied that \"to deal with it properly you need a Rossini or a Donizetti\". Following the success of Otello in 1887 he commented, \"After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little.\" He confided his ambition to the librettist of Otello, Arrigo Boito. Boito said nothing at the time, but he secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, parts 1 and 2.
