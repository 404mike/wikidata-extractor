S. Smythe (6 July 1900  \u2013 27 June 1949), was an English mountaineer, author, photographer and botanist. He is best remembered for his mountaineering in the Alps as well as in the Himalayas, where he identified a region that he named the \"Valley of Flowers\", now a protected park. His ascents include two new routes on the Brenva Face of Mont Blanc, Kamet, and attempts on Kangchenjunga and Mount Everest in the 1930s. It was said that he had a tendency for irascibility, something some of his mountaineering contemporaries said \"decreased with altitude\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 27", "response": ["*1949 \u2013 Frank Smythe, English botanist and mountaineer (b. 1900)"]}, {"page": "Kangchenjunga", "response": ["* In 1930, G\u00fcnter Dyhrenfurth led an international expedition comprising the German Uli Wieland, Austrian Erwin Schneider, and Englishman Frank Smythe who attempted to climb Kangchenjunga.

Frank Smythe, when on the 1936 expedition, believed he spotted a body below the place where Irvine's ice axe had been found three years earlier, \"I was scanning the face from base camp through a high-powered telescope...when I saw something queer in a gully below the scree shelf. Of course, it was a long way away and very small, but I've a six/six eyesight and do not believe it was a rock. This object was at precisely the point where Mallory and Irvine would have fallen had they rolled on over the scree slopes,\" Smythe wrote in a letter to Edward Felix Norton.

Meade gives the pronunciation as , and claims that it is known to Tibetans as Kangmen, signifying \"huge grandmother of a sacred snow chain\". However, Frank Smythe writes in his book Kamet Conquered that the genesis of the name is from the Tibetan word Kangmed (\"the lower snows\", from kang, \"snow\", and med, \"little\"), as distinct from the \"higher snows\" of the Kailash range, 110 miles east of Kamet. (This range is slightly lower than Kamet, its highest peak being Gurla Mandhata, 7,728 m/25,355\u00a0ft; however it stands more fully on the high Tibetan Plateau). At dawn and dusk, \"the copper colored rock of Mount Kamet reflecting the oblique rays of the sun on its hanging glaciers appears to set these glaciers aglow with crackling flames and bathes the mountain in a red burning glow\".

After delays caused by poor weather and illness of team members, a much higher assault camp was placed than in 1924. On the first summit attempt, Lawrence Wager and Percy Wyn-Harris intended to follow the Northeastern ridge, but were unable to regain it, having bypassed (rather than climb over) the First Step, which they reached at 7:00am. The direct access to the Second Step from the First involves a treacherous traverse. Instead of taking it, they dropped down to follow the lower, easier traverse pioneered by Norton in 1924. Observing the Second Step from  below it, Wyn-Harris declared it \"unclimbable.\" Shortly after crossing the Great Couloir, they turned back for poor snow conditions and the lateness of the hour.
