He is best known as the frontman of the British rock band InMe.

The members of the band at that time were Dave McPherson as guitarist / vocalist, Joe Morgan as bassist / backing vocalist and Simon Taylor as drummer. They played several local venues, getting their first interviews and airplay on Brentwood-based radio station, Phoenix FM. They recorded many unreleased tracks such as \"acid drop\" and \"apricot\"  The band scored their break when a scout from MFN caught the end of one of their sets, whilst attending a gig to see another band. They signed with MFN in 2001, and changed their name to InMe to avoid confusion with Drowned, an American Christian rock band of the same name.", "As was frequently confirmed by Dave McPherson on social networking site Facebook as well as on the microblogging site Twitter, InMe planned to spend the early part of 2011 working on their fifth album, which was planned for release in February 2012. The album is to be supported by a PledgeMusic campaign launching on 25 November 2011. The album exhibits  a completely different sound to its predecessor Herald Moth and has been described was \"euphoric, uplifting and very positive\" both by Dave McPherson and lead guitarist Gazz Marlow in the buildup to the album's release. In November 2011 'A Great Man' was released as a free download single via Pledge Music."]}, {"page": "Lynmouth", "response": ["The British technical modern rock band InMe make recurring references to the Lynton/Lynmouth area in their lyrical material.
