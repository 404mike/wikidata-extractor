The chorus master, Charles Swinnerton Heap had died suddenly four months before the concert was due, and with ten works in hand and only one copy of the score, rehearsal started only a few days before the performance date. It was not sung well but was strongly applauded and well reviewed as a composition. He returned in 1903 with The Apostles, and 1906 with The Kingdom. His commission for 1912 created The Music Makers, incorporating themes from the Enigma Variations, Gerontius, his violin concerto, and The Apostles.

Elgar and August Jaeger, his editor at the publisher Novello, exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters,Moore, pp. 302\u2013316 which show how Jaeger helped in shaping the work, and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment.Moore, p. 322 By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar's complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master Charles Swinnerton Heap and his replacement by William Stockley, an elderly musician who found the music beyond him.Moore, p. 325 The conductor of the premiere, Hans Richter, received a copy of the full score only on the eve of the first orchestral rehearsal. The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were Marie Brema, Edward Lloyd and Harry Plunket Greene.Moore, p. 331 The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice.Reed, p. 60 Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, \"I have allowed my heart to open once \u2013 it is now shut against every religious feeling & every soft, gentle impulse for ever.\" However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in BritainMoore, p. 357 once it had had its first London performance in 1903, at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral.Kennedy, Michael, \"Elgar, Sir Edward William, baronet (1857\u20131934)\".

By coincidence the second competition for the Mendelssohn Scholarship was due to be held that gave its winner three years of tuition at the Leipzig Conservatorium. Cowen attended the examination and won the prize, but his parents intervened, as they were not prepared to give up control of him, as stipulated by the terms of the prize. Instead, they agreed to send him to the same institution, but as an independent student. Charles Swinnerton Heap was awarded the prize in his place. At Leipzig, overseen by Ernst Friedrich Eduard Richter, Cowen studied under Moritz Hauptmann (harmony and counterpoint), Ignaz Moscheles (piano), Carl Reinecke (composition) and Ferdinand David (ensemble work).Winston James Baltzell, Complete History of Music.
