The first two were ridden and trained by John Maunsell Richardson at Limba Magna who rode as an amateur (gentleman rider).  Richardson, who had previously won the 1871 Scottish Grand National for Machell, became unhappy with Machell\u2019s attempts to influence the betting market and parted company with him.   Machell moved his jumpers to Joe Cannon at Kentford.  Cannon would ride Regal to victory in the 1876 National.  A further National win was secured for owner John Manners-Sutton, 3rd Baron Manners who had wagered that he could buy and ride the winner of the 1882 Grand National with just a few months preparation.  The horse he chose was Seaman, purchased in Ireland and trained on by Machell and Jimmy Jewitt.  The race - run in a snow storm - was won by Seaman even though he sustained an injury at the final fence.", "Machell was renowned for making large and often successful wagers and for manipulating the betting market in his favour. John Maunsell Richardson had been so \"disgusted with the sordid nature\" of Machell's manipulation that he withdrew from public riding after his 1874 Grand National win on Reugny.  His experience was not unique, in Turf Memories of Sixty Years, Alexander Scott provides other examples of how Machell would use questionable tactics, and Lillie Langtry in her memoirs relates stories told to her by Machell about money making schemes connected with selling plate races."]}, {"page": "1894 Brigg by-election", "response": ["The Brigg by-election of 1894 was held on 7 December 1894.
