Entering the fight as the underdog against the former British Champion, McCarthy dominated the opening stanzas proceeding to knock Wilson down in the third round and was looking to finish the fight with Wilson pinned on the ropes. The fight was stopped when Wilson's 62-year-old mother climbed into the ring and started attacking McCarthy with her shoe, and Wilson's corner man also entered the ring. McCarthy believed he had won and left the ring, but bizarrely referee Adrian Morgan insisted that the fight should continue. McCarthy refused (the injury caused by Wilson's mother required four stitches) and Wilson was declared the winner by technical knockout.\"British Boxer's Mom Takes Bout Into Her Own Hands\", Jet, 16 October 1989, pp. 52-53.
