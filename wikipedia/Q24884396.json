He is currently a Professor at the University of Warwick and is a Distinguished Emeritus Professor and former Chair of the Economics department at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has also held positions at the University of Pennsylvania, the European University Institute and the University of Toronto. He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society, Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and Research Fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, and the former Research Director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). In 2013, he was the Senior Houblon-Norman Fellow at the Bank of England. He is internationally recognized for his work on self-fulfilling prophecies. Farmer has published several scholarly articles in leading academic journals. He is also a co-founder of the Indeterminacy School in Macroeconomics. His body of work has advanced the view that beliefs are a new fundamental in economics that have the same methodological status as preferences, technology, and endowments. In his 1993 book, Macroeconomics of Self-fulfilling Prophecies, he argues that beliefs should be modeled with the introduction of a Belief Function, which explains how people form ideas about the future based on things they have seen in the past. In his 2010 book, Expectations, Employment and Prices, he suggests an alternative paradigm to New Keynesian economics which reintroduces a central idea from John Maynard Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money; that high involuntary unemployment can persist as a permanent equilibrium outcome. He provided an accessible introduction to these ideas in his 2010 book How the Economy Works, and more recently, in his 2016 book Prosperity for All, both of which were written for a general audience. The Farmer Monetary Model has different and high policy implications and relevance. Farmer's policy proposal to achieve full employment by controlling and stabilizing asset prices shows promise as a way to help prevent stock market crashes and deep recessions. His son is the economist Leland Edward Farmer, who joined the faculty at the University of Virginia in July 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barbados", "response": ["Several players in the National Football League (NFL) are from Barbados, including Robert Bailey, Roger Farmer, Elvis Joseph, and Sam Seale.Grasso, John (2013).

As such, it is included in most undergraduate macroeconomics textbooks, but omitted from most graduate texts due to the current dominance of real business cycle and new Keynesian theories. For a contemporary and alternative reinvention of the IS-LM approach that uses Keynesian Search Theory, see Roger Farmer's work on the IS-LM-NAC model, part of his broader research agenda which studies how beliefs independently influence macroeconomic outcomes.", "In the IS-LM-NAC model, the long-run effect of monetary policy depends on the way people form beliefs. Roger Farmer and Konstantin Platanov study a case they call 'persistent adaptive beliefs' in which people believe, correctly, that shocks to asset values are permanent. The important innovation in this work is a model of the labor market in which there can be a continuum of long-run steady state equilibria."]}, {"page": "Natural rate of unemployment", "response": ["According to Roger Farmer of UCLA, the assumption that, after a shock, the unemployment rate returns to its so called \u201cnatural rate' does not hold in the data."]}, {"page": "Sunspots (economics)", "response": ["Sunspot equilibria are important because they introduce the possibility that extraneous uncertainty may cause business cycles. The first paper to exploit this idea is due to Azariadis who introduced the term  \"self-fulfilling prophecy,\" a term he borrowed from Robert K. Merton, to refer to a complete dynamic model in which economic fluctuations arise simply because people believe that they will occur. The idea was extended by Roger Farmer and Michael Woodford to a class of autoregressive models and forms the basis for the Indeterminacy School in Macroeconomics."]}, {"page": "Helicopter money", "response": ["Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter is also known to be a prominent advocate of the concept.
