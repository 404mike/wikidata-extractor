Strong was interested in fields that applied physics to larger problems, eventually deciding to focus on atmospheric physics for graduate studies. Supervised by Fred Taylor at the University of Oxford, she performed near-infrared spectroscopy in the lab, mimicking conditions in the atmosphere of Jupiter, in preparation for the Galileo spacecraft's arrival at Jupiter in 1995. She received a D.Phil. in 1992 from the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics Group at the University of Oxford. During her time at Oxford, she was a student at the first International Space University Summer Session Program in 1988 and then returned as a staff member in 1990."]}]}}
