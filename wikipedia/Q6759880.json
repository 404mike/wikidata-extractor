Their search ended at the Sydney Opera House library, where, as she recounts in her play Shakespeare for My Father (page 48), they came up with Redgrave's obituary, learning that he had died on 25 May 1922, and was buried at South Head Cemetery. There they learned that he had been put in an unmarked grave by somebody called Minnie, who paid 15 shillings. (The idea that it may have been the religious Minnie Tittell Brune feeling sorry for him is enticing. More probably it was Minnie Hider, Esther's friend and confidante, who brought Victor up). They found the spot, and arranged for a headstone, asked his son Michael what it should say, and he said to put, simply, \"Roy Redgrave, Actor\". It was later discovered that Redgrave married Irish widow Mary Leresche in 1916. His marriage certificate makes reference to his previous marriage to Ellen (Judith) but not to any subsequent marriage to Daisy (Margaret Scudamore).
