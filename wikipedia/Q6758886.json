Mr Weir designed the car on the back of a serviette as he came up with the idea of reshaping the back of  an Aston Martin Rapide to turn it into a shooting brake vehicle. The rear of the car took three and a half months to design and the final design was frozen because Aston Martin's chief designer Marek Reichman urged the designers at Bertone to use the updated grille design of the Rapide for the front of the car."]}, {"page": "Lagonda Taraf", "response": ["Project Comet was undertaken by Aston Martin's Q division which specialises in commissioning bespoke cars and  customising existing models to customer specifications.

Only 10 units were hand-built in-house by the company's design and engineering teams in Gaydon. Eight of those 10 cars were featured in the movie, and two more were built for promotional purposes. Aston Martin stated that \"the DB10 gives a glimpse to the future design direction for the next generation of Aston Martins.\" It was later revealed that the DB10 was based on the newly introduced V8 Vantage that made its debut in 2017 and had a modified design so that the design of the new Vantage didn't come to public notice while the car was in development."]}, {"page": "Aston Martin Vulcan", "response": ["The Vulcan was designed by Aston Martin's creative officer Marek Reichman, taking inspiration from the then Aston Martin current models, such as the Vantage, the DB9 and the One-77.

The DBX features swan-hinged doors, while the front grille is the largest ever fitted on an Aston Martin."]}, {"page": "2015 Silverstone 24 Hours", "response": ["|  Andrew Palmer Marek Reichman Alice Powell Andrew Frankel"]}]}}
