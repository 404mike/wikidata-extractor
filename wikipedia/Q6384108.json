A league and cup double was denied though when Winsford beat the Millers 1\u20130 a few weeks later. During the 2011 pre-season to mark the club's 125th anniversary Alex Ferguson sent a Manchester United XI to Church Lane. United won 7\u20130, with their team including future England internationals Michael Keane and Jesse Lingard.  In the 2011\u201312 season Pickering led the Millers to a 9th place after a poor winter saw the team slip out of the play-off places. New Mills were placed in the Southern League but after one season were switched to the Northern Premier League. Pickering remained in charge until October 2012, when he and the club parted company by mutual consent.  Former FC United of Manchester coach Roy Soule became caretaker manager on Pickering's departure and almost led the team to another promotion \u2013 they lost 2\u20130 to Trafford in the play-offs. Soule resigned at the end of the 2014\u201315 season after a disappointing season, the club finishing 2nd from bottom and in the relegation places, and further significant budget cuts. The club accepted a reprieve from the FA to stay in the EvoStik league and Soule was replaced by former Stalybridge Celtic manager Keith Briggs. Briggs resigned just 23 days later after accepting a full time coaching role at Sheffield United and was succeeded by his assistant Andy Fearn, who appointed former Manchester City striker Shaun Goater as his assistant. Fearn and Goater resigned after nine matches, all of which were lost, and former Wythenshawe Town staffer Garry Brown took over, supported by ex-Stockport County winger Paul Williams. The club attracted national attention with their unenviable season record of 26 defeats from the opening 26 league and cup games (the team featured in a TV advert voiced by Harry Redknapp, and the chairman stated defiantly in a two-page article in the Daily Telegraph that \"we're not scared of anyone\"); they were relegated in April 2016 with only 3 points, from 3 draws, a Northern Premier League record low."]}, {"page": "Keith Briggs", "response": ["Keith Briggs may refer to:", "*Keith Briggs (mathematician), English mathematician ", "*Keith Briggs (footballer) (born 1981), English football player"]}, {"page": "Michael Malcolm", "response": ["On failing to make the grade joined Stockport County in July 2005.

He started his career in the youth system at Norwich City, even though his signature was sought by many London clubs. He scored Norwich's first goal in the 2-1 FA Youth Cup victory over the previous season's champions Aston Villa in December 2002. He accompanied the first team during the 2003 pre-season tour to the Netherlands and prior to the signing of Marc Edworthy, was acting as second choice right back behind Keith Briggs. In January 2004, it was announced that he would not be offered a new professional deal by the Canaries after 8 years at the club.  In September 2004, he signed for Barnet, making his debut in a 3\u20131 win over Stevenage Borough in the Football League Trophy. Barnet won the Conference title in his first season with the club, gaining promotion to Football League Two. In May 2005, he signed a new one-year contract with the club after making nineteen appearances in the previous campaign, scoring once in the 7\u20131 rout against Farnborough Town.
