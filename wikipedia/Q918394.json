He spent three seasons at number 2 in the world rankings (1989\u201390, 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394), and he is one of several players to have achieved more than 200 competitive centuries during his career, with 221.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1991 in sports", "response": ["* World Snooker Championship \u2013 John Parrott beats Jimmy White 18\u201311"]}, {"page": "1989 in sports", "response": ["* World Snooker Championship \u2013 Steve Davis beats John Parrott 18\u20133"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* John Parrott \u2013 BBC Sport 2001\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Alex Higgins", "response": ["On 8 April 2010, Higgins was part of the debut Snooker Legends Tour event in Sheffield, at the Crucible.
