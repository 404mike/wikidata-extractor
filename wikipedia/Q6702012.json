A right-handed lower order batsman, he scored 1,244 runs at 11.96, with a best of 83 against Surrey.\nA right arm fast round arm bowler, he took 113 wickets at 18.28, with a best of 8 for 35 against Cambridgeshire.  He also took 6 for 43 against Surrey in the County Championship.\nGreenwood turned to umpiring even before his playing career was finished.  He umpired forty six first-class matches between 1862 and 1886.  With Bob Thoms, he officiated in one Test match, at The Oval between England and Australia in August 1882.  It was after Australia won this match by seven runs that The Sporting Times wrote an obituary for English cricket, and bails were burned and put in an urn to create 'The Ashes'.  He was no stranger to the Australian side, umpiring thirty two first-class matches involving Australian teams on their tours of 1880, 1882, 1884 and 1886.\nHis nephew, Andrew Greenwood, played for Yorkshire and appeared in two Test Matches in 1876/77.  His son-in-law, William Shotton, appeared in two matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club.\nGreenwood died in November 1909, in Morley, Leeds, Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luke (given name)", "response": ["*Luke Greenwood (1834\u20131909), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Despite containing a side with effective players, Yorkshire did not perform as well as expected over the next seasons. The bowling attack was strong, the team contained some experienced players and critics believed Ephraim Lockwood to be the best professional batsman in the country. In 1873, Yorkshire won seven games and lost five and for the following season, Luke Greenwood replaced Rowbotham as captain. The team had an improved record, but although second only to Gloucestershire, Yorkshire lost heavily in both encounters between the teams. Greenwood retired, Rowbotham resumed the captaincy for 1875, and Lockwood took over in 1876. The team did not perform particularly well in either season, but their worst performance came in 1877, winning two games \u2013 but none of the last ten \u2013 and losing seven. This placed them eighth out of nine counties.", "The team faded again in 1882 and Hawke, who had refused the captaincy earlier, was appointed team captain at the end of the season, the first amateur to hold this position. Previous captains had all been professionals: Roger Iddison (1863\u201372), Joseph Rowbotham (1873 and 1875), Luke Greenwood (1874), Ephraim Lockwood (1876\u201377) and Tom Emmett (1878\u201382). Hawke remained in charge for 28 seasons until 1910, during which time the team won eight County Championships."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Luke Greenwood||||1||1882||1882"]}, {"page": "1867 English cricket season", "response": ["|Luke Greenwood || Yorkshire || 1211 || 368 || 34 || 10.82 || 8/35 || 4 || 1"]}, {"page": "Robert Smith (Derbyshire cricketer)", "response": ["Smith took part in the very first fixture played by Derbyshire as a county team in the 1871 season, against a Lancashire side who posted the lowest total against Derbyshire in the history of first-class cricket. He played in both matches between Derbyshire and Lancashire in the 1872 and 1873 seasons. In the 1874 season, with Kent taking on Derbyshire Smith played in all four matches none of which was lost. Also in 1874, he appeared for the United North of England team in a first-class match against the South. His team included early leading lights of cricket such as Tom Emmett, former Yorkshire captain Ephraim Lockwood, and uncle-and-nephew pairing Andrew (a two-time Test player) and Yorkshire captain Luke Greenwood. The South of England had at their disposal early soon-to-become Test greats such as James Lillywhite jnr., Harry Jupp, and Dr. William Gilbert Grace, a combination of early Test cricketers who served to overpower their less experienced opponents. A return match saw a three-day draw, though it came complete with a nine-wicket haul for Grace."]}, {"page": "John Thewlis senior", "response": ["Thewlis came late into the game and was the second man to emerge from Lascelles Hall, Huddersfield, and play for his home county.  The first, Luke Greenwood, became county captain. George Parr, successor to William Clarke in the management of the All-England Eleven, approached him for advice: \"Greenwood, we are going to Southampton to play 22 there. Do you know a good batter?\"Quoted in Pullin 1900, p. 80.  Greenwood replied that, in Thewlis, he did, and so, on nothing more than that brief paean, Parr included him as opening batsman. He was bowled first ball and, as he left the wicket, turned and vowed to the bowler that it would not happen again; nor did it, as Thewlis worked his way to 41 not out in the second innings."]}, {"page": "William Shotton", "response": ["Shotton died in May 1909 in Kirkheaton, Yorkshire.
