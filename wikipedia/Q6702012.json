He umpired forty six first-class matches between 1862 and 1886.  With Bob Thoms, he officiated in one Test match, at The Oval between England and Australia in August 1882.  It was after Australia won this match by seven runs that The Sporting Times wrote an obituary for English cricket, and bails were burned and put in an urn to create 'The Ashes'.  He was no stranger to the Australian side, umpiring thirty two first-class matches involving Australian teams on their tours of 1880, 1882, 1884 and 1886.\nHis nephew, Andrew Greenwood, played for Yorkshire and appeared in two Test Matches in 1876/77.
