West Ham played six games in the Europa League before the 2015\u201316 Premier League began. They were knocked out in the third qualifying round by Romanian side Astra Giurgiu.

Just days after their exit from the Europa League, West Ham played their first game of the Premier League season, winning 2\u20130 away against Arsenal. Premier League debutant Reece Oxford was named man of the match. Despite losing their next two league games, at home to Leicester City and Bournemouth, their fourth game resulted in a 3\u20130 away win against Liverpool at Anfield, their first win there since 1963.

During a period of 30 games between 2017 and 2018, Cooper was sent off three times and received another six game ban for a stamp on Reading defender Reece Oxford. His propensity to be a liability in games earned him the disparaging nickname 'League One Liam' among Leeds fans at the time, but Cooper remained a highly respected captain amongst his team mates.
