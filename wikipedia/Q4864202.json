His impact at Watford was dramatic; he scored 15 goals in Watford's 20 remaining fixtures of the 1967\u201368 season, including 13 goals in his first 13 starts. Despite having played fewer than half of Watford's league games, he finished the season as their top scorer. However, the sale of winger Tony Currie to Sheffield United in July 1968 impacted on the number of chances the team created the following season. Additionally, the purchase of fellow striker Barry Endean prompted manager Ken Furphy to use Dyson in a deeper role. Consequently, he could only manage 4 goals from his 20 appearances in 1968\u201369. With the agreement of Furphy, Dyson was allowed to transfer to Orient in December 1968, for \u00a31,000 less than Watford initially paid for him."]}]}}
