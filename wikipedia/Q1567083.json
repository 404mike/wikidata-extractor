Since it was not customary to acknowledge illustrators alongside authors in the titles of publications, his name was forgotten.  But in 1978, his great ability and the extent of his contribution to Gould's work came to light, in the work of the researcher Christine E. Jackson.", "link_mentions": {}}}
