Since it was not customary to acknowledge illustrators alongside authors in the titles of publications, his name was forgotten.  But in 1978, his great ability and the extent of his contribution to Gould's work came to light, in the work of the researcher Christine E. Jackson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Gould", "response": ["John Gould FRS (; 14 September 1804\u00a0\u2013 3 February 1881) was an English ornithologist. He published a number of monographs on birds, illustrated by plates produced by his wife, Elizabeth Gould, and several other artists, including Edward Lear, Henry Constantine Richter, Joseph Wolf and William Matthew Hart. He has been considered the father of bird study in Australia and the Gould League in Australia is named after him. His identification of the birds now nicknamed \"Darwin's finches\" played a role in the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Gould's work is referenced in Charles Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species.", "Elizabeth died in 1841 after the birth of their eighth child, Sarah, and Gould's books subsequently used illustrations by a number of artists, including Henry Constantine Richter, William Matthew Hart and Joseph Wolf."]}, {"page": "Joseph Smit", "response": ["Smit contributed illustrations to John Gould's books on birds of different parts of the world, along with leading Victorian era wildlife artists including Wolf, Edward Lear, William Hart, Henry Constantine Richter and J.G.

Gould's description was issued in the fifth volume (1841) of Birds of Australia, and was accompanied by a lithograph produced by Elizabeth Gould, rendered shortly before her early death. The specimen obtained from Burges, mentioned in Gilbert's report of September 1839, was later revealed to be an immature bird when another specimen was shot by Gilbert in 1842. This bird, found 60 kilometres north of Moore River, was larger and paler than the first Gilbert had supplied, and although he thought it may be an older bird he hopefully noted it as a possible new species. The explorer Charles Sturt also collected two specimens, and these were forwarded to Gould in England. Gould wrote an emended description and commissioned Henry Constantine Richter to produce a new plate, this was issued in the 1848 volume of the same work."]}, {"page": "Black-billed mountain toucan", "response": ["* John Gould and Henry Constantine Richter: A Monograph of the Ramphastidae, or Family of Toucans, London 1854"]}, {"page": "Curl-crested aracari", "response": ["* John Gould and Henry Constantine Richter: A Monograph of the Ramphaastidae, or Family of Toucans, London 1854"]}, {"page": "Guianan toucanet", "response": ["* John Gould)/Henry Constantine Richter: A Monograph of the Ramphastidae, or Family of Toucans, London 1854"]}]}}
