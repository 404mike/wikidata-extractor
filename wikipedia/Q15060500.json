In particular, he is widely seen as a pre-eminent historian of British India. He is known both for stylistic flair and meticulous research into archival primary sources, including centuries-old unpublished sources.The author of some twenty-five books, he also writes regularly for a number of prominent publications in Britain and Asia.  He began his career with The Economist. He has received several major honours including the Sir Percy Sykes Memorial Medal. In 2019, he received an honorary doctorate, presented by Princess Anne, from the University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland.The Economist has called him \"a gifted non-academic historian\", the Yorkshire Post has called him \"one of our most outstanding historians\", The Independent has called his writing \"exquisite\" and The Guardian has described his historical analysis as \"forensic\" and his writing as \"restrained yet powerful\". He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Keay lives in both Edinburgh and in Argyll in the West Highlands of Scotland and travels widely.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mahabharata", "response": ["B. B. Lal used the same approach with a more conservative assumption of the average reign to estimate a date of 836 BCE, and correlated this with archaeological evidence from Painted Grey Ware (PGW) sites, the association being strong between PGW artifacts and places mentioned in the epic.B. B. Lal, Mahabharata and Archaeology in Gupta and Ramachandran (1976), p.57-58 John Keay confirms this and also gives 950 BCE for the Bharata battle."]}, {"page": "Rajasthan", "response": ["Rajasthan literally means \"The Land of Kings\". The oldest reference to Rajasthan is found in a stone inscription dated back to 625 CE. The first printed mention of the name Rajasthan appears in the 1829 publication Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India, while the earliest known record of Rajputana as a name for the region is in George Thomas's 1800 memoir Military Memories. John Keay, in his book India: A History, stated that Rajputana was coined by the British in 1829, John Briggs, translating Ferishta's history of early Islamic India, used the phrase \"Rajpoot (Rajput) princes\" rather than \"Indian princes\"."]}, {"page": "Shiva", "response": ["Sir John Marshall and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined.Flood (1996), pp. 28\u201329. Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns. Scholars such as Gavin Flood, John Keay and Doris Meth Srinivasan have expressed doubts about this suggestion.", "Gavin Flood states that it is not clear from the seal that the figure has three faces, is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure. He characterizes these views as \"speculative\", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva iconographic themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a bull.Flood (2003), pp. 204\u2013205. John Keay writes that \"he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati\", but a couple of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra. Writing in 1997, Srinivasan interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man."]}, {"page": "Kama Sutra", "response": ["The original composition date or century for the Kamasutra is unknown. Historians have variously placed it between 400 BCE and 300 CE. According to John Keay, the Kama Sutra is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE. In contrast, the Indologist Wendy Doniger, who has co-translated the Kama Sutra and published many papers on related Hindu texts, the surviving version of the Kama Sutra must have been revised or composed after 225 CE because it mentions the Abhiras and the Andhras dynasties that did not co-rule major regions of ancient India before that year. The text makes no mention of the Gupta Empire which ruled over major urban areas of ancient India, reshaping ancient Indian arts, Hindu culture and economy from the 4th century through the 6th century. For these reasons, she dates the Kama Sutra to the second half of the 3rd century CE."]}, {"page": "The Man Who Would Be King", "response": ["* Alexander Gardner (1785\u20131877), American adventurer captured in Afghanistan in 1823.

John Keay states in A History of China, shaman is the single loan-word from Manchurian into the English language. After the conquest of China in the 17th century, although Manchus officially adopted Buddhism and widely adopted Chinese folk religion, Shamanic traditions can still be found in the aspects of soul worship, totem worship, belief in nightmares and apotheosis of philanthropists. Apart from the Shamanic shrines in the Qing palace, no temples erected for worship of Manchu gods could be found in Beijing. Thus, the story of competition between Shamanists and Lamaists was oft heard in Manchuria but the Manchu emperors helped Lamaists or Tibetan Buddhists officially."]}, {"page": "Francis Garnier", "response": ["* John Keay, Mad About The Mekong  "]}, {"page": "Barnstaple", "response": ["*John Keay (born 1941), historian and radio presenter born in Barnstaple"]}]}}
