A lifetime of correspondence has proven to be a valuable source of information on both Harriet and the period in which she lived. According to the writer Charlotte Furness, Harriet's many letters \"give us a remarkable insight into life in the nineteenth-century aristocracy, and life as the wife of a travelling diplomat\". The historian Virginia Surtees adds that Harriet's letters \"provide an entertaining peepshow into the manners, habits and morals of that much inter-married section of aristocratic nineteenth-century society which also embraced the dandies, wits, and beaux\".", "Since Harriet's death, four edited books containing her letters have been printed. In 1894, her son Frederick published a two-volume edition of letters written during his parents' marriage, condensing and cutting some of her correspondence in order to produce a shorter work. Harriet's granddaughter Susan Oldfield published another series of letters in 1901, this time drawing from Harriet's later life as a widow. In 1947 Iris Leveson-Gower, another descendant, published a volume of letters written in the years before Harriet's marriage. In 1990, Virginia Surtees produced another edited collection that focuses on Harriet's time as a social hostess as well as her close relationship with Georgiana."]}]}}
