A member of a substantial naval dynasty, he eventually rose to the rank of vice admiral, but is chiefly remembered for his engagement with the American frigate USS Constitution which saw the loss of his ship, HMS Guerriere.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isaac Hull", "response": ["On August 19, 1812, USS Constitution encountered the British frigate  at sea. As Constitutions crew went to quarters, Hull cautioned his gunners: \"No firing at random. Let every man look well to his aim.\"Maloney, pp. 187\u2013189. Captain James Richard Dacres of Guerriere at first tried to cripple Constitution at long range, but quickly found this tactic of no avail. He then approached Constitution at close range. All the while Captain Hull kept his crew calm telling them \"I'll tell you when to fire, so stand steady and see that not a shot is thrown away.\"  At 6:05 the two ships were alongside and Constitutions starboard guns, at Hull's orders, poured in a broadside of \"double-shotted\" (two round shots loaded in one gun and fired at the same time). Writing on August 28, 1812 to Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton, Hull recalled,  'when we were within less than a pistol shot, we commenced a very heavy fire from all our guns, loaded with round and grape, which done great Execution, so much that within fifteen minutes from the time we got alongside, his Mizzen Mast went by the board, and his Main Yard in the Slings and the Hull and Sails very much injured, which made it difficult for them to manage her.\" Hull continued: the enemy put his helm to port, \"at the time we did, but his Mizzen Mast being over the Quarter prevented her coming too, which brought us across his Bow, when his Bowsprit over our Stern. At this moment I determined to board him, but the instant the Boarders were called, for that purpose, his Foremast and Main Mast went by the board and took with them the Gib boom and every spar except the Bowsprit ... we stood off for about half an hour to repair our braces and other riggings that had been shot away and wore around to return to the enemy, it being now dark we could not see whether she had any colors flying or not.\" Moses Smith, a seaman, would later recall \"Several shot now entered our hull. One of the largest the enemy could command struck us, but the plank was so hard it fell out and sank in the waters. This was afterwards noticed and the cry arose: 'Huzza! Her sides are made of iron! See where the shot fell-out!' From that circumstance the name of the Constitution was garnished with the familiar title.\"The War of 1812 Writings from America's Second War of Independence editor Donald R.
