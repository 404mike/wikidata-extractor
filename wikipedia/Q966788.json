He was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, and educated at Uppingham School. He is nicknamed \"Aggers\", and, less commonly, \"Spiro\" \u2013 the latter, according to Debrett's Cricketers' Who's Who, after former US Vice-President Spiro Agnew.Agnew had a successful first-class career as a fast bowler for Leicestershire from 1979 to 1990, returning briefly in 1992. In first-class cricket he took 666 wickets at an average of 29.25.  Agnew won three Test caps for England, as well as playing three One Day Internationals in the mid-1980s, although his entire international career lasted just under a year. In county cricket, Agnew's most successful seasons came toward the end of his career, after his last international match, when he had learned to swing the ball. He was second- and third-leading wicket-taker in 1987 and 1988 respectively, including the achievement of 100 wickets in a season in 1987. He was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1988.\nWhile still a player, Agnew began a career in cricket journalism and commentary. Since his retirement as a player, he has become a leading voice of cricket on radio, as the BBC Radio cricket correspondent and as a commentator on Test Match Special.  He has also contributed as a member of Australian broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Grandstand team.\nAgnew's on-air \"leg over\" comment on Test Match Special, made to fellow commentator Brian Johnston in 1991, provoked giggling fits during a live broadcast and reaction from across the UK. The incident has been voted \"the greatest sporting commentary ever\" in a BBC poll; Michael Henderson, one of Agnew's peers and rivals, has described him as \"a master broadcaster ... the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "East Midlands", "response": ["The region has a good sporting tradition, with some of the most well-known sports personalities \u2013- David Gower (Leicestershire C.C.C.), Gary Lineker, Rory Underwood (Leicester Tigers) and Jonathan Agnew."]}, {"page": "Valerie Amos, Baroness Amos", "response": ["Amos is an enthusiast of cricket and talked about her love of the game with Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special during the lunch break of the first day of the England v.

In 1970 Johnston was dropped from the TV commentary team and he retired from the BBC two years later on his sixtieth birthday.
