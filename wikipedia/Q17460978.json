Oxford's Matthew Pinsent was the heaviest rower while Cambridge's Sinclair Gore was the youngest, aged 19. Cambridge's crew featured three returning Blues in Dirk Bangert, David Gillard and James Behrens, while Oxford saw five former Boat Race rowers return. Overall, half of the rowers were non-British (six nationalities representing Oxford, three representing Cambridge) and the same number were postgraduates.  The Cambridge boat club president Behrens claimed: \"All our boat are at Cambridge on academic merit.  They came for a particular course\u00a0... and they also row.\"  In contrast, an editorial in The Times claimed: \"The performers are no longer ingenuous native undergraduates but supercharged, international, professional rowing machines.\"  Oxford's Bruce Robertson (men's eight) and Pinsent (coxless pair) were both gold medallists at the Barcelona Olympics.", "The journalist David Miller, writing for  The Times, described Cambridge's victory as \"crushingly conclusive\".  Cambridge's Malcolm Baker said: \"We knew we could do it after about 25 strokes.\"  Behrens explained \"Our strength was that we were more uniform than Oxford.  We have proved that you do not have to be an Olympic champion to win the Boat Race.\" The Oxford Boat Club president Pinsent conceded: \"They put right a lot of mistakes they have made in the past, and they rowed outstandingly well.\"  Spracklen agreed: \"Cambridge got too far away.  They were a better boat in that race.  All credit to them.\"  Cambridge's number two, David Gillard, said \"there was a lot of revenge out there\"."]}, {"page": "List of Old Bedford Modernians", "response": ["* David Gillard (born 1971), rowed for Great Britain and also for Cambridge in the 1991, 1992 and 1993 Boat Races"]}, {"page": "Gillard, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Gillard"]}]}}
