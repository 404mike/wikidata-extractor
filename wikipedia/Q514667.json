She wrote before the term was coined, and was discussed for a century as a writer of Gothic fiction, fantasy or horror. She also created the first popular gardening manuals, as opposed to specialist horticultural works, reframing the art of gardening as fit for young women. She was married to the well-known horticulturalist John Claudius Loudon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jane Loudon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jane Wells Webb Loudon"]}, {"page": "Jane Webb Loudon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jane Wells Webb Loudon"]}, {"page": "Jane C.
