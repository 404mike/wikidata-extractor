They moved to the United States due to the influence of Benjamin Pitman's brother, Isaac, who wanted to establish and spread phonographic shorthand before it was popularized. Soon after the move, while transitioning in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jane gave birth to her second son, Ellis. Both Ellis and Arnold died during their brief stay in Pennsylvania. By 1855, the Pitman's settled in Cincinnati, Ohio where her husband established the Cincinnati Phonographic Institute."]}, {"page": "Ben Pitman", "response": ["#redirectBenjamin Pitman"]}, {"page": "Pitman, Benjamin", "response": ["#redirectBenjamin Pitman"]}]}}
