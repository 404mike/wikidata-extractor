Where the mantle of Chun's specimen (Velodona togata togata) was significantly wider than it is long, the mantles of Robson's specimens had a much smaller difference between width and length, with one specimen having a mantle with identical width and length. The length of the membrane that links the octopus's arms \u2014 the umbrella \u2014 was shorter in Robson's specimens than in Chun's, and there were additional warts with papillates on his specimens that were not described in Chun's specimen. Robson also noted a significant difference in the hectocotylus in Chun's specimen and those in his specimens. He noted that while two of his specimens appeared to be fully sexually developed, their hectocotyli looked comparatively underdeveloped. Owing to the difference in overall size between Chun's and Robson's specimens, however, Robson conjectured that the difference in hectocotyli may be due to the specimens' ages. Robson described the coloring of the specimens as \"a rather deep reddish brown (verging in a distinctly purple shade in one)\" for the males, with a \"darker brown\" for the female."]}, {"page": "Colossal squid", "response": ["The species was first discovered in the form of two arm crowns found in the stomach of a sperm whale in the winter of 1924\u20131925.
