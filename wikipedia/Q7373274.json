Low adopted an attacking policy, but still relied on men like Sproson to hold the fort at the back. They took the Fourth Division title in 1958\u201359, though Sproson spent the first half of the season on the sidelines with an ankle injury. Terry Miles took his No. 6 jersey, though both Alan Martin and Roy Pritchard failed to hold on to the No. 3 jersey, which Sproson claimed in February 1959.
