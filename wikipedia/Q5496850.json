Forwards Harry Morris and Harry Anstiss scored the majority of the team's goals and player-manager Mitchell had dropped himself from the team in favour of Cyril Hunter in December 1921. On 11 February 1922, Freddy Capper became the first Brentford player to be sent off in a Football League match. He received his marching orders from referee Harry Curtis, who would later be appointed as Brentford's manager in 1926. Five defeats in seven matches during February and March, coupled with poor away form throughout the season, ruled out the possibility of automatic promotion, but the team finished strongly and won five of the final eight matches to finish 9th. Brentford won just one away league match during the season, which is the joint-fewest in club history.", "A rare event occurred on the final day of the season at Swansea Town's Vetch Field, when Brentford were able to field just 9 men at the kick off.
