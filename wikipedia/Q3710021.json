He became a Fellow, saw active service at the Battle of Jutland in World War I and, after decades of ill health, died in London.\nHe proved Mercer's theorem, which states that positive-definite kernels can be expressed as a dot product in a high-dimensional space. This theorem is the basis of the kernel trick (applied by Aizerman), which allows linear algorithms to be easily converted into non-linear algorithms.", "link_mentions": {}}}
