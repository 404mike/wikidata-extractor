He became a Fellow, saw active service at the Battle of Jutland in World War I and, after decades of ill health, died in London.\nHe proved Mercer's theorem, which states that positive-definite kernels can be expressed as a dot product in a high-dimensional space. This theorem is the basis of the kernel trick (applied by Aizerman), which allows linear algorithms to be easily converted into non-linear algorithms.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Edensor Littlewood", "response": ["In 1903, Littlewood entered the University of Cambridge, studying in Trinity College. He spent his first two years preparing for the Tripos examinations which qualify undergraduates for a bachelor's degree where he emerged in 1905 as Senior Wrangler bracketed with James Mercer (Mercer had already graduated at Manchester university before attending Cambridge). In 1906, after completing the second part of the Tripos, he started his research under Ernest Barnes.: \"He began his research later that year on asymptotic formulas for integral functions of order zero, under his tutor and director of studies E. W. Barnes.\" One of the problems that Barnes suggested to Littlewood was to prove the Riemann hypothesis, an assignment at which he did not succeed.: \"Barnes proposed to Littlewood the task of proving the Riemann hypothesis ... he did not succeed in that strenuous assignment ...\" He was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1908. From October 1907 to June 1910 he worked as a Richardson Lecturer in the University of Manchester and returned to Cambridge in October 1910, where he remained for the rest of his career.  He was appointed Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics in 1928, retiring in 1950.  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1916, awarded the Royal Medal in 1929, the Sylvester Medal in 1943 and the Copley Medal in 1958.
