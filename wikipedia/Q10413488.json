Merson's main job is on Sky Sports, where he is a match reporter and regular pundit for Gillette Soccer Saturday. Merson is often the target of good-humoured jabs from Jeff Stelling and other members of the Soccer Saturday panel; for example, in his attempts to pronounce the names of foreign players. However, Stelling himself, in September 2016, attempted to have Merson agree with him that Ireland international Harry Arter (who had made his debut against England) should get an England call-up in the week Gareth Southgate took over in an emergency capacity following Sam Allardyce's dismissal."]}, {"page": "Scott Parker", "response": ["Parker is the brother-in-law of footballer Harry Arter, who played under Scott Parker for Fulham.

The promotion formed part of an incredible rise up the Football League with the club having been close to liquidation only ten years prior when they were in League Two, and as recently as 2008 had gone into administration and nearly lost their Football League status. The club have since surprised many by consolidating themselves in the Premier League, finishing 16th in their first season in the top flight and then an impressive 9th in their second season, in spite of having limited spending power in relation to modern day Premier League figures. Key to Bournemouth's success was keeping a core of home-grown players together that had risen through the leagues with the club, Harry Arter and Marc Pugh establishing themselves at the highest level, having been lower league players beforehand. They stayed in the Premier League for five seasons before getting relegated in 2019\u201320 on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "Dan Gosling", "response": ["On 16 May 2014, Gosling agreed a four-year contract with Championship club AFC Bournemouth. Due to the prominent midfield partnership of Harry Arter and Andrew Surman, Gosling struggled to cement his position in the starting XI in the league. Gosling commented that \"On my first day here, I saw the quality and it took me by surprise a little. I didn\u2019t play a lot because the team was performing so well and it was the same for Adam Smith and Junior Stanislas. I made one start in the Championship season which, out of 46 games, was quite incredible really\". Gosling did however go on an impressive scoring run in the League Cup, scoring 5 goals in 5 appearances. Gosling finished his debut season with the club having made 24 total appearances, as the Cherries were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history.
