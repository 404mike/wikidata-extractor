Her sister was the feminist dystopian author Katharine Burdekin and her partner lived with them from the 1920s. In 1929, a local village group of players had staged Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in a nearby meadow at Crean, repeating the production the next year. They decided that their next production would be The Tempest and Miss Cade offered the garden of her house as a suitable location, as it was beside the sea. Miss Cade and her gardener, Billy Rawlings, made a terrace and rough seating, hauling materials down from the house or up via the winding path from the beach below. In 1932, The Tempest was performed with the sea as a dramatic backdrop, to great success. Miss Cade resolved to improve the theatre, working over the course of the winter months each year throughout her life (with the help of Billy Rawlings and Charles Angove) so that others might perform each summer."]}, {"page": "Spondon", "response": ["* Katharine Burdekin (born Cade), feminist author was born here."]}, {"page": "List of dystopian literature", "response": ["* Swastika Night (1937) by Katharine Burdekin\" a feminist novelist called Katherine Burdekin published under a male pseudonym, Murray Constantine, an anti-fascist dystopia with the title Swastika Night..\"Alkeline van Lenning, Marrie Bekker, Ine Vanwesenbeeck, (p.88)  Feminist Utopias in a Post Modern Era.
