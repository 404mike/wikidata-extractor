Most early lawyers were not noted for their eloquence, with Thomas Elyot writing that \"[they] lacked elocution and pronunciation, two of the principal parts of rhetorike\", and Roger Ascham saying that \"they do best when they cry loudest\", describing a court case where an advocate was \"roaring like a bull\". In court, Coke was insulting to the parties, disrespectful to the judges and \"rough, blustering, overbearing\"; a rival once wrote to him saying \"in your pleadings you were wont to insult over misery and to inveigh bitterly at the persons, which bred you many enemies\". Coke was pedantic and technical, something which saw him win many cases as a barrister, but when he became Attorney General \"he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form\u00a0...

He had an elder brother, Richard. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in November 1546, aged 17, but took no degree, and was admitted to the Middle Temple on 11 August 1556.", "There is no direct evidence beyond Bolton's ascription to identify the author with George or Richard Puttenham, the sons of Robert Puttenham and his wife Margaret, the sister of Sir Thomas Elyot, who dedicated his treatise on the Education or Bringing up of Children to her for the benefit of her sons.  Furthermore, since Bolton's ascription occurs 15 years after George's death and four after Richard's neither man would have been able to either accept or reject the attribution.  Both made unhappy marriages, were constantly engaged in litigation, and were frequently in disgrace. One fact that points towards George's authorship is that Richard was in prison when the book was licensed to be printed, and when he made his will in 1597 he was in the Queen's Bench Prison. He was buried, according to John Payne Collier, at St. Clement Danes, London, on 2 July 1601.  Richard Puttenham is known to have spent much of his time abroad, whereas George is only known to have left England a single time, to get the deed for Sherfield House from his brother. This agrees better with the writer's account of himself; but if the statement that he addressed Elpine to Edward VI when he was 18 years of age be taken to imply that the production of this work fell within that king's reign, the date of the author's birth cannot be placed anterior to 1529. At the date (1546) of his inheritance of his uncle, Sir Thomas Elyot's estates, Richard Puttenham was proved in an inquisition held at Newmarket to have been twenty-six years old.  The history of the Puttenhams is discussed in H. H. S. Croft's edition of Elyot's Boke called the Cover nour. A careful investigation brought him to the conclusion that the evidence was in favour of Richard. There are other modern editions of the book, notably one in Joseph Haslewood's Ancient Critical Essays (1811\u20131815).
