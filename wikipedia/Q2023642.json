Later in the month, he finished second in the Spalding Tournament and in May he was tied for second in the Swallow-Penfold Tournament. He was third in the Yorkshire Evening News Tournament in June and tied for 12th in the 1957 Open Championship.

Alliss finished second in the Order of Merit with a stroke average of 71.21, behind Eric Brown on 70.99.
