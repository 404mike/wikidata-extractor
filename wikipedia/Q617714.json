Trouble followed however, as a 5\u20131 defeat at Queen's Park Rangers was followed by Gould's resignation, the manager claiming that Richardson was forcing him into selling star striker Peter Ndlovu. Phil Neal took over and was initially allowed to strengthen the team rather than sell. The club played some positive football and possessed two top-class players in Ndlovu and Phil Babb, but remained unable to play consistently through a whole season and finished 11th. A strong end to the season meant that 1994\u201395 began with optimism, enhanced by Neal's purchase of Dion Dublin and American winger Cobi Jones. December injuries to Dublin and David Busst led to a poor run of results, culminating in FA Cup defeat to Norwich and supporters quickly turned against Phil Neal. Neal's reputation had also fallen with the release of \"The Impossible Job\", a documentary about former England manager Graham Taylor and Neal, his assistant, which portrayed the latter as a \"yes man\" with no independent opinions. He was sacked and replaced by Ron Atkinson, with Gordon Strachan named assistant manager."]}, {"page": "Dave Busst", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Busst"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["Once again, Coventry City defied the odds after a season of struggle.

Tragedy struck the club as promising defender David Busst suffered a harrowing broken-leg injury during a clash with Denis Irwin and Brian McClair from a corner in the 1-0 defeat at Manchester United, often considered one of the worst football injuries in history, which ultimately ended his career.
