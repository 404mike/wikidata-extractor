His award of the Victoria Cross was unique in that it is the only award given to a soldier in a naval action. It was also unusual, though not unique, in having been suggested by a German officer. (For similar cases see Lt Cdr Gerard Roope VC RN, recommended by letter from Kapitan zur See Hellmuth Heye, commanding the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, and Flying Officer Lloyd Trigg VC RNZAF, recommended by Oberleutnant Klemens Schamong, captain U-468.)\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
