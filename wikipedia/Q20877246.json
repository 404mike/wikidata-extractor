Despite 18 goals from Geordie Reid, Brentford finished bottom of the First Division in 1908\u201309, but were spared relegation. Winning the Southern Professional Charity Cup proved to be a scant consolation for secretary-manager Fred Halliday in his first season in charge. In April 1909, hopes about the possibility of the club being elected into the Football League were quashed, when the league's clubs voted down Queens Park Rangers' proposal that the Southern League First Division be merged with the Football League, to create a Third Division. Also in 1909, Brentford's colours were changed to gold shirts with blue sleeves. Manager Fred Halliday lasted in the job until November 1912, when he reverted to his secretarial duties and captain Dusty Rhodes was installed as player-manager.

The Bees had a good first half of the Southern League First Division season, losing just five of the opening 20 matches, with Geordie Reid (Southern League XI) and Steve Buxton and John Christie (both London XI) winning representative honours.
