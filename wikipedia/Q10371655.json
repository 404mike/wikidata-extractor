However, before his death, director Simon Hartog formed an agreement with Brazilian organizations so that the domestic rights to the documentary would not fall into the hands of the network so that it would be possible for it to be widely disseminated by political and cultural organizations. The network lost interest in buying the film after their lawyers discovered the clause, but to this day a court order prohibits the showing of Beyond Citizen Kane in Brazil. According to the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, in the 1990s, Rede Record had tried to purchase the broadcasting rights to the documentary, but \"realized that there would be a legal dispute with the Rede Globo about the many video clips taken from their programming. Therefore it decided not to buy it\". In August 2009, at the height of an exchange of accusations between the networks caused by money laundering charges of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Rede Record bought the broadcast rights for the documentary for approximately $20\u00a0million US dollars and awaits the authorization from the courts to show it on TV."]}, {"page": "Vera Neubauer", "response": ["In the UK Neubauer became one of founding members of the film collective 'Spectre' that included Stephen Dwoskin, Phil Mulloy, Simon Hartog, Anna Ambrose, Michael Whyte, John Ellis, Keith Griffiths, and Thaddeus O'Sullivan."]}]}}
