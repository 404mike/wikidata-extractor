This decision had a change in style brought about by Robinson's style of presenting, including her approach to interviews with notable figures from within the companies featured in investigations on the programme. For her first series, she was teamed up with Simon Walton and Alice Beer, the latter having been an assistant producer until she was brought on as a co-presenter, assigned with being a link between the consumers (on the phone in earlier years, and e-mail in later years) and the main presenter. Walton left after the first series, while Beer remained until 1999, whereupon she was replaced by Charlotte Hudson, who remained until 2001. Because of her workload requiring her to be present with hosting the British and American versions of The Weakest Link, Robinson also left the programme that same year. Following Robinson's departure, the BBC replaced her with Nicky Campbell as the programme's main presenter, with Paul Heiney joining a year later as a regular co-presenter of his team; additional co-presenters in the team were changed during Campbell's tenure, and included Ashley Blake, Saima Mohsin, Nick Lawrence, and Dan Penteado. Between 2001 and 2004, Campbell was joined by Kate Gerbeau as the other main presenter of the programme, while between 2005 and 2009, he was joined by Julia Bradbury, who was temporarily replaced during her last series in 2009 by Anita Rani between 6 February and 20 April;\"Asian journalist Anita Rani replaces Julia Bradbury as Watchdog host\" Thaindian News, 3 March 2009 Rani was retained as a reporter following this, taking the place of Mohsin.", "| 2004\u201305 || Paul Heiney and Saima Mohsin"]}, {"page": "BBC Points West", "response": ["*Saima Mohsin"]}, {"page": "The Sarah-Jane Mee Show", "response": ["| Saima Mohsin || Relief Presenter"]}]}}
