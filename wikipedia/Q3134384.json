During his career he sang leading roles with most of Great Britain's major opera institutions, including the Edinburgh Festival, the Glyndebourne Festival, the Royal Opera House, the Sadler's Wells Opera, and the Welsh National Opera. He is best known for creating the role of Mr. Redburn in the world premiere of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd at the Royal Opera House, London, on 1 December 1951. Music critic Elizabeth Forbes wrote that his voice was \"dark toned, resonant\", and \"especially effective as Zaccaria in Nabucco.After retiring from opera performance in 1963, Alan continued to appear as a concert singer up until his death. He also taught on the voice faculty at the Royal College of Music and worked as a lay vicar at Westminster Abbey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Henderson (baritone)", "response": ["Henderson became a Professor at the Royal Academy of Music in 1940.
