These include authority, tradition, hypocrisy, landscape, art, sexuality, and most of all, its mystical, ancient pagan past. All of this comes together in the growing pains of the adolescent Stephen, a vicar's son, whose encounters include angels, Edward Elgar and King Penda himself. The final scene of the play, where the protagonist has an apparitional experience of King Penda and the \"mother and father of England\", is set on the Malvern Hills.David Rudkin: Sacred Disobedience: An Expository Study of His Drama 1959-96 by David Ian Rabey, Oxford, Routledge, 1998 Rolinson, D.
