In one episode, the crew happen upon an alternative dimension where Kochanski survived the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident. She joins Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapses. By the first episode of the Red Dwarf: Back to Earth specials, Lister believes her to be dead, but it is later revealed that Kryten (the sole witness to her \"death\") had lied to Lister. Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her.

After years of research and work, Turner was able to develop a working time machine. Turner used the machine to carry out experiments on time and the laws and rules by which it abides, such as 'you can't change the past' and 'time won't allow paradoxes'. The only other person Turner ever told about the machine was his daughter Holly. When Turner failed to return to the machine in time on his last trip and was trapped in a loop of infinity, Holly took over work on the machine and continued to maintain and perfect it to continue his experiments. To do so, Holly needed money but she didn't dare apply for a grant for fear of someone discovering the machine. So, she went to work for the CID as a science officer and it was there that she met detective Jeff Slade. The two were friendly from the start but when Holly used the machine to help Slade out after a case had gone badly wrong and got Slade in trouble, Slade found out about the machine. This resulted in their relationship becoming closer and they began spending time together outside work. Holly is clearly attracted to Slade as he is to her but like him, she chooses not to reveal this to him, probably because she thinks that if the machine were not around then Slade wouldn't give her a second glance. Like Slade, Holly tends to keep herself to herself, possibly more so than he does because she is so terrified that someone may find out about the machine. Whilst she feels that Slade relies too much on the machine to solve his cases, she does seem to like having someone to talk to about the machine and she no longer has to keep all the financial worries that its upkeep brings completely to herself.", "* Chlo\u00eb Annett as Holly Turner \u2014 Forensic scientist whose father invented the time machine, which she keeps and adjusts in her apartment."]}, {"page": "Chloe", "response": ["* Chlo\u00eb Annett (born 1971), British actress"]}, {"page": "University Challenge", "response": ["|Red Dwarf Cast: (Robert Llewellyn, Danny John-Jules, Chris Barrie, Chlo\u00eb Annett, Craig Charles)", "The show has seen numerous specials, including those for specific professions and celebrity editions, such as Universe Challenge, presented by former host and Red Dwarf fan, Bamber Gascoigne, where the cast of Red Dwarf challenged a team of their \"ultimate fans\" to celebrate Red Dwarf's 10th anniversary on the air.
