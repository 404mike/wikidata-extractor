A defender, he primarily played as a centre-back, but also played as a full-back, central midfielder and striker.\nHe began his career with Luton Town where he made his professional debut. After a brief loan spell with non-League side Aylesbury United, he established himself in the first team at Luton and made 70 appearances in all competitions before signing for West Bromwich Albion in 2007 for an initial fee of \u00a32.5 million. In his first season with Albion, he helped the club win promotion to the Premier League by winning the 2007\u201308 Championship. He later lost his place in the side due to injury and loss of form, spending the majority of the 2009\u201310 season on loan with Coventry City.\nHe joined Norwich City on loan in 2010 before completing a permanent transfer in January 2011. His first season with the club led to a second career promotion from the Championship after finishing as runners-up. He appeared sporadically over the following two seasons and was loaned to Cardiff City in the final months of the 2012\u201313 season before being sold to Wigan Athletic at the end of the campaign. He made nearly 100 appearances for the club, winning League One during the 2015\u201316 season. He finished his career with spells at Bury and Northampton Town after being forced to retire at the age of 32 due to a heart condition. He subsequently launched his own football academy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tony Mowbray", "response": ["High-profile players such as Jason Koumas, Diomansy Kamara and Curtis Davies were sold to Premier League clubs for large fees, in addition to the departures of Paul McShane, Nathan Ellington, Darren Carter and Steve Watson. Mowbray replaced them by signing a total of 14 permanent and loan players in the summer transfer window, making an overall profit in the process. His most expensive signings were Chris Brunt from Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a33 million, Leon Barnett from Luton Town for \u00a32.5 million, and James Morrison from Middlesbrough for \u00a31.5 million."]}, {"page": "Zak Whitbread", "response": ["He made his long-awaited return from injury in a 4\u20132 win over Sheffield United on December 28, 2010, coming on as an 85th-minute substitute for Anthony McNamee. He made his first start of the season in a 1\u20130 victory over league leaders Queens Park Rangers, helping Norwich to a first clean sheet in 10 games. Due to Leon Barnett's hamstring injury, Whitbread developed a centre back partnership with Elliott Ward. He scored his first goal for Norwich in a 1\u20131 draw against Hull City at the KC Stadium on March 19, 2011.", "He made a return to the Norwich squad on December 3 against Manchester City, featuring as an unused substitute. In the next fixture against Newcastle United, Whitbread was given a start in a 4\u20132 win for Norwich, playing well apart from giving the ball away for Demba Ba's second goal. Whitbread kept his place for the following matches, performing admirably with Russell Martin in defence. He was partnered with Daniel Ayala from the New Year's Eve fixture against Fulham, and this partnership has seen Norwich win two consecutive away matches and three wins out of three in 2012. Whitbread was withdrawn early in the 2\u20130 victory over Bolton Wanderers, along with Daniel Ayala after complaining of a tight hamstring, 20\u00a0minutes after Ayala was subbed due to a suspect hamstring tear. He immediately regained his place upon his return to fitness, again at the expense of Leon Barnett in the narrow 2\u20131 defeat to Manchester United. He suffered a minor calf injury, before the 2\u20132 draw against Everton, causing manager Paul Lambert to withdraw him from the squad. He was eventually released by the club at the conclusion of the season."]}, {"page": "Kevin Blackwell", "response": ["On 27 March 2007, Blackwell was announced as the new manager of Luton Town and began his tenure with a draw against Burnley. Luton were already in the bottom 3 when Blackwell took over and were 9 points from safety with 3 games to go. Blackwell set about rebuilding the side, his priority to get in some experience. To achieve this he sold centre back Leon Barnett to West Bromwich Albion, and defender Kevin Foley to Wolves, as well as releasing centre-back Russ Perrett and \u00a3500,000 signing Adam Boyd, who went on to score 14 goals that season for Leyton Orient. He also lost Markus Heikkinen on a free transfer. In replacement he brought in high-profile players such as Paul Peschisolido, Chris Perry, Don Hutchison, Paul McVeigh and Paul Furlong. He also signed some younger players in Alan Goodall, Richard Jackson and Dave Edwards."]}, {"page": "Michael Nelson (footballer)", "response": ["In June 2009, Nelson agreed to join Norwich City, who had just been relegated to League One, on a two-year deal once his contract at Hartlepool expired at the end of the month. He made his debut in the 7\u20131 opening-day thrashing at the hands of Colchester, and did not play for the first team again until the game against his former club Hartlepool later in August, in which he scored a magnificent overhead kick. It was his first goal for Norwich and put the Canaries on course for a 2\u20130 win at Victoria Park. Nelson established himself as a regular starter following an injury to teammate Jens Berthel Askou in December. He subsequently formed a strong central defensive partnership with Gary Doherty as Norwich surged up the League One table, overhauling runaway leaders Leeds United in the process. On 17 April 2010, he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory at Charlton Athletic which secured Norwich's return to the Championship at the first attempt. Nelson's scored his third goal for Norwich in a 2\u20130 win over Gillingham. In his second season, Nelson scored his fourth goal against Watford in a 3\u20132 loss in Norwich City's first match of the season. Nelson scored his fifth and last goal for Norwich against Sheffield United in a 4\u20132 win. Nelson remained in the first team for Norwich City until he suffered a foot injury. Following his return from injury, Nelson was targeting the first team but was deemed surplus to requirements by Canaries boss Paul Lambert as Lambert favoured Elliott Ward and Leon Barnett as their first choice centre back. Nelson is held in very high esteem by Norwich City fans for his performances during the successful League One campaign. He received a standing ovation from Carrow Road on his return with new club Scunthorpe United."]}, {"page": "Barnett", "response": ["* Leon Barnett (born 1985), English football player"]}, {"page": "Martin Cranie", "response": ["Two days after signing with the club, Cranie made his Coventry City debut, coming off in the 72nd minute, in a 2\u20130 win over Barnsley. Thirty days later, Cranie scored his first career goal in Coventry's 3\u20132 home win against Sheffield United on 15 September 2009. The goal was a flicked header at the near post from a corner and turned out to be the match winner as it gave Coventry a 3\u20131 lead. In mid-November Cranie found himself in an unfamiliar role as a right-back and on the bench, slipping down to the pecking order following the arrival of Leon Barnett and Richard Wood. Cranie then provided an assist for Jon Stead, which turned out to be the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over Peterborough United on 6 March 2010. Ahead of a match against Middlesbrough on 24 April 2010, Cranie suffered a knee injury in training, but eventually recovered and was in the squad, which played to a 1\u20131 draw.

In preparation for the 2016\u201317 campaign, Flitcroft released six players and brought in a number of new signings, including: Antony Kay, Greg Leigh, Leon Barnett, Neil Danns, Paul Rachubka, Chris Brown and James Vaughan. Flitcroft was named as League One Manager of the Month for September 2016 after overseeing five wins from five games that the League Managers Association described as \"guided by Flitcroft\u2019s beliefs in attacking play and some shrewd moves at the end of the transfer window\". On 16 November, Flitcroft was sacked after a run of 11 games without a win that coincided with a series of injuries to first-team players such as Tom Pope, Danny Mayor and Nathan Cameron. Gareth Southgate's promotion to England manager left a vacancy for the head coach role of the under-21 team and Flitcroft applied for the position, making into the final four of the interview process, though the job instead went to Aidy Boothroyd."]}, {"page": "Ryan McGivern", "response": ["On 3 November 2017, McGivern signed a two-month contract with League One side Northampton Town.
