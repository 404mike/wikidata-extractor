The band consisted mostly of ex-students of the Glasgow School of Art, Initial band members were Will Bradley (drums), Chris Evans (bass) and Robert Johnston (guitar). Painter Sue Tompkins (vocals) joined later in 1999. The band split writing duties, with Johnston, Bradley and Evans writing the music while Tompkins wrote the vocals. Tompkins' \"talk-sung\" vocal styling eventually became the band's most famous attribute.

While John Mulvey of NME compared Tompkins' voice to \"the scrape of fingernails on a blackboard,\" opining that \"only mad people and immediate family could warm to Tompkins,\" other critics were more receptive. Jenn Sikes of Splendid praised Tompkins' vocals, stating, \"The chewed word-bits are like little metronomes, counting beats between her  words, which are spoken/sung in a cheery Scottish accent that's childlike but fierce.\" Kellman commented that \"[h]er repet-pet-petitive repetitive style might be at odds with the ears of some listeners, but it's just as unique as the exuberant vocals\" employed by Tompkins' influences. Connor McEleney of Structured Harmony praised bassist Chris Evans by describing him as \"the stronghold underneath which Tompkins makes her unique sound palatable.\"", "*Sue Tompkins \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Electra (arts organisation)", "response": ["Electra has worked with a wide range of artistic practitioners including Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Holly Antrum, Vicki Bennett, Steve Beresford, The Bohman Brothers, Sonia Boyce, Angus Carlyle, Maria Chavez, Beatrice Dillon, Kenneth Goldsmith, Goodiepal, Kim Gordon, Carl Michael von Hausswolff, Emma Hedditch, Will Holder, Karl Holmqvist, Claire Hooper, Holly Ingleton, Jakob Kirkegaard, Jutta Koether, Christina Kubisch, Cathy Lane, Isla Leaver-Yap, Annea Lockwood , Pauline Boudry / Renate Lorenz, Lydia Lunch, Christian Marclay, Daria Martin, Kaffe Matthews, Eline McGeorge, Claudia Molitor, Carlos Motta, Hayley Newman, Pil and Galia Kollectiv, Pauline Oliveros, Olivia Plender, Charlotte Prodger, Lucy Reynolds, James Richards, Marina Rosenfeld, Dawn Scarfe, Richard Thomas, Cara Tolmie, Mareike Bernien/ Kerstin Schroedinger, Matthias Sperling, Verity Susman, Sue Tompkins, Salom\u00e9 Voegelin, YKON."]}, {"page": "GENERATION: 25 Years of Contemporary Art in Scotland", "response": ["* Sue Tompkins"]}, {"page": "Midway Contemporary Art", "response": ["*Its chiming in Normaltown, Sue Tompkins, September 7-October 20, 2012"]}, {"page": "Hayley Tompkins", "response": ["Hayley Tompkins (born 1971) is a British artist based in Glasgow.
