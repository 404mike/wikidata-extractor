Some scholarly editions divide the Tales into ten \"Fragments\". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order). Victorians frequently used the nine \"Groups\", which was the order used by Walter William Skeat whose edition Chaucer: Complete Works was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now seldom followed."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Chaucer", "response": ["Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as John Dryden, admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.\"From The Preface to Fables Ancient and Modern\".

It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of Walter William Skeat's work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, The Canterbury Tales was selected by William Caxton to be one of the first books to be printed in England.", "Scholars such as Frederick James Furnivall, who founded the Chaucer Society in 1868, pioneered the establishment of diplomatic editions of Chaucer's major texts, along with careful accounts of Chaucer's language and prosody. Walter William Skeat, who like Furnivall was closely associated with the Oxford English Dictionary, established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies."]}, {"page": "Haggis", "response": ["Clarissa Dickson Wright says that it \"came to Scotland in a longship [i.e., from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation\".

Like earlier medieval writers, Chaucer identifies Pluto's realm with Hell as a place of condemnation and torment,In Troilus and Criseyde (lines 590\u2013503), as noted by Rosalyn Rossignol, Critical Companion to Chaucer: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work (Facts on File, 2006), p. 540. and describes it as \"derk and lowe\" (\"dark and low\").Chaucer, \"The Knight's Tale\" 2082 and 2299. But Pluto's major appearance in the works of Chaucer comes as a character in \"The Merchant's Tale,\" where Pluto is identified as the \"Kyng of Fayerye\" (Fairy King).Rossignol, Critical Companion pp. 432, 540. As in the anonymous romance Sir Orfeo (ca. 1300), Pluto and Proserpina rule over a fantastical world that melds classical myth and fairyland.John M. Fyler, \"Pagan Survivals,\" in A Companion to Chaucer (Blackwell, 2000, 2002), p. 351. Chaucer has the couple engage in a comic battle of the sexes that undermines the Christian imagery in the tale, which is Chaucer's most sexually explicit.Seth Lerer, \"The Canterbury Tales,\" in The Yale Companion to Chaucer (Yale University Press, 2006), p. 270. Pluto and Proserpina in The Merchant's Tale have been seen as Shakespeare's model for Titania and Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream, a view at least as old as Chaucer's editor Thomas Tyrwhitt (see 1798 edition) and reiterated by Walter William Skeat in his edition of The Canterbury Tales ( 1894 edition). The Scottish poet William Dunbar ca. 1503 also described Pluto as a folkloric supernatural being, \"the elrich incubus / in cloke of grene\" (\"the eldritch incubus in cloak of green\"), who appears among the courtiers of Cupid.William Dunbar, The Goldyn Targe (1503), lines 126\u20137, as cited by Ian Simpson Ross, William Dunbar (Brill, 1981), p. 252.

According to one interpretation, the name derives from the white garments worn by catechumens, those expecting to be baptised on that Sunday. Moreover, in England white vestments, rather than the more usual red, were traditional for the day and its octave. A different tradition is that of the young women of the parish all coming to church or chapel in new white dresses on that day.

The origin of the town's name has two possible sources. The first is that it is a derivative of the Anglo-Saxon Alfreinscoma - by which name it was noted in the Liber Exoniensis of 1086. The translation of this name (from Walter William Skeat of the department of Anglo Saxon at Cambridge University) means the \"Valley of the sons of Alfred\". The second origin is that the name Ilfracombe was derived from Norse illf (bad), Anglo-Saxon yfel (evil ford) and Anglo-Saxon cumb (valley) perhaps from a Celtic source (compare Welsh cwm), thus 'The valley with the bad ford'."]}, {"page": "Parlement of Foules", "response": ["*Parlement of foules.

In the 19th century, Walter William Skeat speculated that the name was originally \"Trivagante\", meaning \"thrice wandering\", a reference to the moon, because of the Islamic use of crescent moon imagery. An Old English origin has also been suggested, from tiw mihtig (\"very mighty\"), referring to the Germanic god Tiw. Another possibility is that it derives from a confusion between Muslims and the Zoroastrian Magi of ancient Iran: thus tyr-magian, or \"Magian god\". Joseph T. Shipley argues that it evolved from the Italian \"Trivigante\" and became confused with \"\", meaning boaster, derived from Hermes Trismegistus. Leo Spitzer argues that Tervagant, like several other names ending in -ant from the Matter of France (e.g. Baligant and Morgant), is an \"occitanization\" of a vulgar Latin present participle created by Old French poets for exotic effect. He proposes as its etymon terrificans (terrifying), appropriate for a god.Leo Spitzer, \"Tervagant\", Romania 70.279 (1948): 39\u2013408."]}]}}
