More serious than this, however, was the substantial drop in the numbers of those attending the cathedral \u2013 a drop that proved to be ongoing.

Accordingly, he petitioned the Holy See for permission to transfer the cathedral to St Margaret's, Ayr, the mother church in the area. The decision taken in Rome, in view of the fact that Bishop Taylor was due to retire, was that any decision concerning the future of the cathedral should be left to his successor. Bishop John Cunningham came to the same conclusion as Bishop Taylor concerning the future of the cathedral.
