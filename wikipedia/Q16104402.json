He was born in Preston, Lancashire in 1936.\nBurns was educated at grammar school, worked in mills, and joined the army in 1954. While stationed in Germany, Burns developed a love of jazz and of American writers, accessible through American Forces Network radio and through bookshops stocking new literature for American service personnel. After leaving the army in 1957, he returned to Preston and sought out new writers filtering through to Britain, travelling to Manchester and London to explore those experimental bookshops which stocked the more difficult-to-find ones.\nBurns had his first poems published in New Voice magazine in 1962, and soon began writing for and about small poetry magazines in a range of publications including The Guardian, Tribune and Ambit. Several books of his poetry have been published, including two volumes of his selected works.In 1964, Burns launched Move, a poetry magazine featuring British and North American writers (including Chris Torrance, Larry Eigner, Lee Harwood, Bill Deemer, Michael Horovitz, Earle Birney, Dave Cunliffe and Tina Morris) which ran for eight issues (it folded in 1968): it was part of the British poetry revival, lauded beyond the traditional audience of middle class intellectuals in London, Oxford and Cambridge. Burns contributed poetry to many other magazines, and literary reviews and articles to The Guardian, Tribune and New Society. Perhaps his most important contributions were bringing the world of small poetry magazines to a wider audience through regular reviews and columns, and in particular spreading his knowledge of those lesser known North American writers who he felt deserved greater attention.\nWhen the editor of Palantir poetry magazine (published through Preston Polytechnic) stepped down, Burns took over from issue number 3 in May 1976; this gave him the opportunity to direct attention to writers he felt deserved more support. Working on Palantir through to the final (23rd) issue in 1983, he included work from many leading poets (for example, Gael Turnbull, Wes Magee and Edwin Brock), and wrote about the lesser known beat poets.\nAs of 2014, Burns continues to write on jazz, literature and politics, and has published several essay collections including Beats, Bohemians & Intellectuals (Trent Books, 2000), Radicals, Beats & Beboppers (Penniless Press, 2011) and Artists, Beats & Cool Cats (Penniless Press, 2014).\nBibliography\nPoetry\nA Way of Looking at Things\t\t\tMove Publications\t\t1964\nTwo for Our Time\t\t\t\t\tScreeches\t\t\t    1964\nSome Poems\t\t\t\t\t        Crank Books (NY)\t\t1965\nSome More Poems\t\t\t\t\t    R Books\t\t\t        1966\nThe Summer Season\t\t\t\t    Target Publications\t\t1966\nMy Sad Story & Other Poems\t\t\tNew Voice\t\t\t    1967\nCells: Prose Pieces\t\t\t\t\tGrosseteste Press\t\t1967\nSaloon Bar: Three Jim Burns Stories\t\tFerry Press\t\t\t1967\t\nThe Store of Things\t\t\t\t\tPhoenix Pamphlets\t\t1969\nTypes: Prose Pieces and Poems\t\tSecond Aeon\t\t        1970\nA Single Flower\t\t\t\t\t    Andium Press\t\t    1972\nLeben in Preston\t\t\t\t\tPalmenpresse\t\t    1973\nEaster in Stockport\t\t\t\t\tRivelin Press\t\t\t1975\nFred Engels in Woolworths\t\t\tOasis Books\t\t\t    1975\nPlaying it Cool\t\t\t\t\t    Galloping Dog Press\t    1976\nThe Goldfish Speaks from Beyond the Grave\tSalamander\t\t1976\nFred Engels bei Woolworth\t\t\tRotbuch Verlag\t\t    1977\nCatullus in Preston\t\t\t\t\tCameo Club Alley Press\t1979\nAristotle\u2019s Grill\t\t\t\t\tPlatform Poets\t\t    1979\nNotes from a Greasy Spoon\t\t\tUni College Cardiff\t\t1980\nInternal Memorandum\t\t\t\t    Rivelin Press\t\t\t1982\nNotizen Von Einem Schmierigen Loffel\tPalmenpresse\t\t1982\nGestures (cassette)\t\t\t\t\tBlack Sheep Recording Co1982\nThe Real World\t\t\t\t\t    Purple Heather Press\t1986\nOut of the Past: Selected Poems 1961-1986 Rivelin Grapheme\t1987\nPoems for Tribune\t\t\t\t\tWide Skirt Press\t\t1988\nThe Gift\t\t\t\t\t\t    Redbeck Press\t\t    1989\nConfessions of an Old believer\t\tRedbeck Press\t\t    1996\nBeware of Men in Suits\t\t\t\tIncline Press\t\t\t1996\nAs Good A Reason As Any\t\t\t    Redbeck Press\t\t    1999\nThe Five Senses\t\t\t\t\t    Incline Press\t\t\t1999\nTake it Easy\t\t\t\t\t\tRedbeck Press\t\t    2003\nBopper\t\t\t\t\t\t        Ragged Edge\t\t        2004\nGermany and all that Jazz\t\t\tRagged Edge\t\t        2005\nShort Statements\t\t\t\t\tRedbeck Press\t\t    2006\nLaying Something Down\t\t\t\tShoestring Press\t\t2007\nCool Kerouac\t\t\t\t\t    Beat Scene Press\t\t2008\nWhat I Said\t\t\t\t\t\t    Eyelet Books\t\t\t2008\nStreetsinger\t\t\t\t\t\tShoestring Press\t\t2010\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maurice Scully", "response": ["Contributors included Roy Fisher, Knute Skinner, William Oxley, Randolph Healy, Brian Coffey, David Wright, Paul Durcan, John Freeman, John Jordan, Anthony Cronin, Gavin Ewart, Eoghan \u00d3 Tuairisc, George Barker, Dermot Bolger and Jim Burns."]}, {"page": "British Poetry Revival", "response": ["These poets included Roy Fisher, Gael Turnbull, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Bob Cobbing, Jeff Nuttall, Tom Raworth, Michael Horovitz, Eric Mottram, Peter Finch, Edwin Morgan, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, Lee Harwood, and Christopher Logue. Many of these poets joined Allen Ginsberg and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall International Poetry Incarnation on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British happening. Earlier British happenings included John Latham's event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; Gustav Metzger's 1964 auto-destructive art; Adrian Henri's 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's The Cavern Club; and Jeff Nuttall's events in Better Books. They had their roots in Dada events at the Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich) at the start of the century.Jeff Nuttall, Bomb Culture", "Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, Geraldine Monk is very much a poet of the North of England. Like Maggie O'Sullivan, she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including Jim Burns, Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed, CUSP, mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.Geraldine Monk, CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).", "The Cambridge poets were a group centred around J. H. Prynne and included Andrew Crozier, John James, Douglas Oliver, Veronica Forrest-Thomson, Peter Riley, Tim Longville and John Riley. Prynne was influenced by Charles Olson and Crozier was partly responsible for Carl Rakosi's return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The Grosseteste Review, which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of The English Intelligencer, a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by Peter Riley. Contributors and recipients included Peter Armstrong, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, John Hall, John James, Tim Longville, Barry MacSweeney, J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Temple, Chris Torrance and Nick Wayte'Neil Pattison, Reitha Pattison, Luke Roberts (eds.), Certain Prose of 'The English Intelligencer (Cambridge: Mountain Press, 2012)"]}, {"page": "The English Intelligencer", "response": ["The Intelligencer was circulated to a mailing list of British poets; the number of correspondents varied between 25 and 65, with a constant core of about a dozen.
