The programme is set in Royston Vasey, a fictional town in northern England, originally based on Alston, Cumbria, and follows the lives of bizarre characters, most of whom are played by three of the show's four writers \u2013 Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, and Reece Shearsmith \u2013 who, along with Jeremy Dyson, formed the League of Gentlemen comedy troupe in 1995. The series originally aired for three series from 1999 until 2002 followed by a film in 2005.", "Three of the four members of the League of Gentlemen (Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith) met at Bretton Hall Theatre School. They met their final member \u2013 Jeremy Dyson \u2013 later in their comedy career. He does not act as such in the franchise but does have a few small/ cameo roles throughout the series. The stage show began in late 1994, and it was not long before the team took as their name the title of a 1960 Jack Hawkins film, The League of Gentlemen. In 1997, they were awarded the Perrier award for comedy at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and their radio series On the Town with The League of Gentlemen, debuted on BBC Radio 4. On the Town was set in the fictional town of Spent. They won a Sony Award for this six-episode run. In 1999 the show moved to television and quickly acquired a cult following; three series were produced, the first airing in 1999, the second in 2000 and the third in 2002. A Christmas special was broadcast in December 2000, after the airing of the second series. For television, Spent was renamed Royston Vasey \u2013 the given name of comedian Roy Chubby Brown, who appears in the series, notably as the Mayor of Royston Vasey in series 2. Along with The Fast Show, the series is credited with the revival of the sketch show format in BBC comedy. Its influence can be seen on later series, particularly Little Britain (the first series of which was directed by Steve Bendelack and script-edited by Gatiss).", "It is widely believed that a lot of the characters and indeed the town are based on Pemberton's home town of Chorley, with Royston Vasey based on Adlington, a village within Chorley Borough. A second source of inspiration is the town of Alston in Cumbria. The character of Herr Lipp is believed to be based on a hospital chaplain Steve Pemberton encountered after suffering a heart attack in Germany and Pauline is primarily based on a restart officer of Reece Shearsmith's. Similarly, Ollie Plimsolls is based on a community theatre actor that Shearsmith had worked with. Gatiss has said in interview that the local shop was inspired by a shop in the village of Rottingdean and that he was influenced growing up around the former Winterton Hospital asylum near Sedgefield.", "The majority of the inhabitants of the village \u2013 male and female \u2013 are played by Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton, and Mark Gatiss, and the script was written by these three, along with Jeremy Dyson. Dyson, not an actor like the others, appears only in cameo roles. As there are usually only three actors on screen at any one time, the different characters mostly play out their own stories in several serialised sketches, rarely crossing into each other's storylines. Only rarely do actors \"meet themselves\". Exceptions include Papa Lazarou facing the Reverend Bernice in the Christmas Special (both Reece Shearsmith), Les McQueen buying a magazine from Pop's son (both Mark Gatiss), and Alvin Steele buying food from Iris at a supermarket checkout in Series 2 (again, both Mark Gatiss). The idea is taken further in The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse, when the characters meet the actors (especially when Herr Lipp meets his creator, Steve Pemberton). In the live shows, when Pam Doove was auditioning for a part in the Christmas Nativity Play, directed by Ollie Plimsolls, Pam had to audition in front of Ollie's Legz Akimbo colleague Dave (Pemberton), who said that Ollie couldn't make it \"for obvious reasons\" (Shearsmith plays both Pam and Ollie in the television series).", "Royston Vasey draws on the upbringing of all the League of Gentlemen's members \u2013 Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson \u2013 all of whom were raised in the north of England. Royston Vasey is the real name of British stand-up comedian Roy Chubby Brown. Brown played the part of the town's mayor in a cameo appearance. Brown is a controversial stand-up whose profanity-laden material has resulted in his never appearing on the BBC other than this brief appearance.", "In the film The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse, the town is on the verge of destruction when the League of Gentlemen \u2013 Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, and Reece Shearsmith \u2013 agree to stop writing for Royston Vasey. This causes meteorites to rain from the sky until the entire town is razed to the ground. The destruction of Royston Vasey can only be prevented when all four of the writers are killed, but it transpires that the entire ordeal was conceived by Dyson while unconscious in a hospital."]}, {"page": "2002 in film", "response": ["| Birthday Girl || Miramax Films || Jez Butterworth (director/screenplay); Tom Butterworth (screenplay); Nicole Kidman, Ben Chaplin, Vincent Cassel, Mathieu Kassovitz, Kate Evans, Stephen Mangan, Xander Armstrong, Sally Phillips, Ben Miller, Jonathan Aris, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss || Comedy, Thriller || Live Action"]}, {"page": "Royal National Theatre", "response": ["The third season of broadcasts launched on 15 September 2011 with One Man, Two Guvnors with James Corden.
