He built the company up from nothing to one of the major record labels of the world.\nA financier by profession, Lewis was professionally engaged by the fledgling Decca company. Having failed to persuade its directors to diversify from making record-players to making records, he raised the capital to take the company over, and ran it until his death.  Among the ground-breaking achievements of Decca under Lewis were the \"Decca Navigation System\" (the leading maritime and aviation navigation system prior to GPS), the Decca \"ffrr\" recording technology, and the first release on record of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
