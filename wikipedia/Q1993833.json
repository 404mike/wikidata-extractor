This increased the size of the league to five teams in the West and four in the East. As for Glass, his entire team had returned for another year. In addition, Jim Lefkos had rejoined the Varsity Blues after missing the previous two seasons, as well as rookies Ron Muir, John Gero and Jim Laverty. Glass said, during try-outs, said that \"many good players are going to be cut this year...[as an] indication of how strong we are\". In preseason exhibition, the Varsity Blues defeated a team of ex-Toronto City players 8-3\u2014 a team which included Bobby Nicol and Alan Harvey. Blues goalkeeper, Edwin Stach compared this Blues team to his former University of Western Ontario squad: \"there is no comparison [ to his old team Western ]. At Western, we practiced only two nights per week while [in Toronto] we are out almost every day. Also, I'm sure if the coach at Western had the players that Blues cut this season, he would be mighty happy.\" Glass described his team as \"at least top 20 in Ontario\" and many of the more experience Varsity Blues players felt the team would finish at least mid-table in the Ontario National League \u2014 the semi-pro league."]}]}}
