The ship was located at sea by a Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Condor, and shortly after arriving in Iceland, Avenger was subjected to a bombing attack by another Condor. Both of the bombs it dropped missed the ship, but two houses ashore were demolished.

Her mission was to attack the convoys, but she had been ordered to avoid battle with heavy Allied units.

Scharnhorst disengaged again and headed south for the safety of her Altafjord base. The cruisers & destroyers took up a shadowing role. Burnett was aware that a heavier Royal Navy force commanded by Admiral Bruce Fraser aboard the battleship  was steaming from the west to intercept her. Admiral Erich Bey aboard Scharnhorst was not aware. About 5.15pm the black of the winter Arctic night was lit up as bright as day by starshells, & the battle began in earnest. Outnumbered, outgunned, surrounded, her retreat cut off, there could be only one end.
