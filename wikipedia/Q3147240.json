After 42 senior appearances for the club he left in 1969\u201370 for Doncaster Rovers. He made over 150 League appearances for Rovers, and after moving to Lincoln City in 1973\u201374, he went on to make over 150 league appearances for the Imps as well.Branfoot was manager of Reading from 31 January 1984 to 23 October 1989,. He must rank as one of Reading's most successful managers, leading Reading to promotion from Division 4 to Division 3 in 1984 based on the good work of Maurice Evans, and then promotion from Division 3 to Division 2 as champions in 1986. This last achievement included a record breaking start to the season of 13 straight wins. The club maintained a 13th position the next season but were relegated in 1988. However, in the same season that they won the Full Members Cup beating Luton Town 4\u20131 at Wembley.He became manager of Southampton in June 1991, remaining in this position until January 1994. He then managed Fulham between 1994 and 1996. Branfoot later had a spell at Sunderland as academy director and at Leeds United as a scout. He also coached at Winchester College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["In 1992, the foundation of the Premier League, and the resignation of 22 clubs from The Football League, restored Fulham to that league's Second Division.

Although Branfoot accepted that a sale was inevitable, he claimed that \"whatever happens, we are in the driving seat\".Quoted in  In July 1992, Shearer was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of \u00a33.6 million, with David Speedie reluctantly moving to The Dell as part of the deal. Despite Branfoot's claim to be \"in the driving seat\", Saints failed to include a \"sell-on clause\" in the contract.

He was replaced by Ian Branfoot, who until the end of the 1990\u201391 season had been assistant manager to Steve Coppell at Crystal Palace. By this stage, a key player in the Southampton line-up was Guernsey-born attacking midfielder/striker Matthew Le Tissier, who broke into the first team in the 1986\u201387 season. He was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 1990 and later made eight appearances for the England team\u00a0\u2013 he finally retired in 2002 at the age of 33. Another exciting young player to break into the Southampton team just after Le Tissier was Alan Shearer, who at the age of 17 scored a hat-trick against Arsenal in a league match in April 1988. Shearer was a first team regular by 1990, and stayed with Southampton until July 1992, when he was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a national record of more than \u00a33\u00a0million. He then became the most expensive footballer in the world when Blackburn sold him to Newcastle for \u00a315\u00a0million in 1996.

The side's moment of cup glory came in 1988 when they won the Simod Cup, beating a number of top-flight sides en route to their Wembley win over Luton Town. Reading were promoted to the Second Division as champions in 1986 under the management of Ian Branfoot, but were relegated back to the Third Division in 1988."]}, {"page": "Peter Reid", "response": ["Following his dismissal by Manchester City, in October 1993 Reid was persuaded by Ian Branfoot to resume his playing career with Southampton who were then in the middle of a crisis: the Saints fans were calling for Branfoot to be sacked with the club having lost eight of their first nine games. Reid brought a touch of guile and stability to the Saints side; despite playing only eight games he made a major contribution to the team's fortunes as Saints' season started to come together. He led them to some important victories, most specially over Newcastle United on 24 October 1993, a game in which Matthew Le Tissier scored two goals. His final game for Saints was a 3\u20131 victory over Chelsea on 28 December 1993."]}, {"page": "Gateshead", "response": ["*Ian Branfoot \u2013 footballer and manager (Sheffield Wednesday and Southampton)"]}, {"page": "Peter Shilton", "response": ["In 1994, he started to concentrate solely on management and Plymouth reached the Division Two play-offs, but lost in the semi finals to Burnley.

At the time of his appointment, Southampton seemed doomed to relegation, having spent virtually the whole season to that point in the drop zone. Ball's first task as manager was to re-establish Matthew Le Tissier's role in the team and to ensure that the other players recognised that he was the club's greatest asset. Le Tissier responded by scoring 6 goals in Ball's first 4 games in charge, including a hat-trick on 14 February 1994 in a 4\u20132 victory over Liverpool.
