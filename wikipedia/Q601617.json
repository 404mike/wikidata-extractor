They are consisted of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey.", "Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London (UCL) in September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at the University of Oxford, to be the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. The band's line-up was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience). Initially, the band rehearsed in Jonny Buckland's bedroom in a flat, with neighbours who were able to tolerate the noise.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  The band finally settled on the name \"Coldplay\", which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group.", "Bassist Guy Berryman once explained that the band often have a title and concept in mind before the music arrives, which serves to provide a \"framework into which we can work thematically\". During an interview for YouTube in 2019, Chris Martin described their way of making songs as \"a series of doors\" where he usually brings initial ideas to guitarist Jonny Buckland, who either disapprove them or give his input. The same happens from Buckland to Berryman and then drummer Will Champion, allowing all band members to express themselves artistically. This process, however, is known to not always be linear, given how tracks like \"Magic\" and \"Adventure of a Lifetime\" started through the bass and guitar riffs from Berryman and Buckland respectively.", "Coldplay have explored many music styles throughout their career, with their sound being considered alternative rock, alternative pop, pop rock, post-Britpop, soft rock, and pop. After winning a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2009, lead vocalist and pianist Chris Martin jokingly stated in his acceptance speech that they were \"limestone rock\", in comparison to \"hard rock\". In the late 1990s, the EPs released by the band had characteristics of dream pop, setting them apart from their future releases. Their first studio album, Parachutes (2000), was described as \"melodic pop\" with \"distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion\", being \"exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive\" as well. Bassist Guy Berryman called it \"a quiet, polite record\", and drummer Will Champion compared the lyrics to Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day\", saying that they are \"beautiful and happy\", but the music is \"really, really sad\", adding that it is the \"kind of thing where you can create differing moods through the sound and lyrics\".", "*  He said during an interview in the next year that his favorite song of all time is \"Teardrop\" by Massive Attack as well. Meanwhile, bassist Guy Berryman is known to be inspired by acts like James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Kool & the Gang and The Funk Brothers, which were among his reasons for playing bass.", "The band performed a slightly modified version of \"A Message\", entitled \"A Message 2010\", at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon special, raising money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
