He played local football before joining Birmingham during the First World War. When the Football League resumed, Evans made his debut in the Second Division on 27 September 1919, standing in for Joe Roulson at right half in a home game against Huddersfield Town which Birmingham won 4\u20132. He played five more games during the 1919\u201320 season, in each case taking Roulson's place at right half either in his absence or while he switched to the left to replace Percy Barton. Unable to establish himself as a first-team player, Evans spent the 1921\u201322 season in the Third Division South with Brighton & Hove Albion, but played only five matches when regular right half Jack Woodhouse was unavailable through injury. He then returned to the Black Country where he played for several years in the Birmingham & District League for Cradley Heath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Evans", "response": ["Thomas Evans or Tom Evans may refer to:", "*Tom Evans (baseball) (born 1974), major league baseball player", "*Tom Evans (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u2013after 1926), English-born football wing half for Birmingham and Brighton & Hove Albion", "*Tom Evans (footballer, born 1903), Welsh international footballer", "*Tom Evans (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u20131993), Welsh footballer for Tottenham Hotspur", "*Tom Evans (footballer, born 1976) (born 1976), English-born Northern Ireland footballer for Scunthorpe United and York City", "*Tom Evans (rugby union) (1882\u20131955), Welsh international rugby player", "*Tom Evans (runner) (born 1992), British long-distance runner", "*Tom Evans (Victorian politician) (1917\u20132009), member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "*Tom Evans (Western Australian politician) (1929\u20131995), member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly", "*Tom Evans (musician) (1947\u20131983), member of the band Badfinger"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["**Tom Evans (rugby player) (1882\u20131955), Welsh international rugby player", "**Tom Evans (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u2013after 1926), English-born football wing half", "**Tom Evans (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u20131993), Welsh footballer for Tottenham Hotspur", "**Tom Evans (Australian politician) (1917\u20132009), member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "**Tom Evans (musician) (1947\u20131983), English musician and songwriter, member of the band Badfinger", "**Tom Evans (baseball) (born 1974), major league baseball player", "**Tom Evans (footballer, born 1976) (born 1976), English-born Northern Ireland footballer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Eli Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Evans (footballer, born 1896)"]}, {"page": "Tom Evans (footballer born 1896)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Evans (footballer, born 1896)"]}]}}
