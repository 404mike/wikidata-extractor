He also saw service in India.  Although his war records were destroyed during the London Blitz of 1940, it is likely that he left the Army in 1907, when he worked as a collier at the Bedlinog Colliery. \nHe enlisted in the newly formed Welsh Horse Yeomanry in 1915 and the regiment was sent to Gallipoli (it had been converted to an infantry regiment) and carried out mining and sapping duties in the area around Hill 60. They were evacuated to Egypt as part of the last British troops to leave the peninsula.  The Welsh Horse provided part of the garrison in the Libyan desert until January 1917, when they were merged with the 1/1 Montgomeryshire Yeomanry and then formed the 25th Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army. During the last week of October, the 25 RWF were positioned on the right of the 74 Division, in the centre of the line where, along with 24 RWF they were to be the brigade's two attacking battalions. At this time, Collins was 37 years old, and an acting corporal when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.On 31 October 1917, during the Battle of Beersheba at Wadi Saba, Beersheba, Palestine, when, after deployment, prior to an attack, his battalion was forced to lie out in the open under heavy shell and machine-gun fire which caused many casualties. Corporal Collins repeatedly went out under heavy fire and brought back many wounded to cover, thus saving many lives.  In subsequent operations throughout the day, he was conspicuous in rallying and leading his command. He led the final assault with the utmost skill in spite of heavy fire at close range and uncut wire. He bayoneted 15 of the enemy and with a Lewis gun section, pressed on beyond the objective and covered the reorganization and consolidation most effectively although isolated and under fire from snipers and guns.He later achieved the rank of sergeant.\nHe was decorated with the Victoria Cross by HM King George V at Buckingham Palace on 1 June 1918.  His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum, Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales, where there is a plaque in the entrance to his memory.  A painting of Collins by G Ethridge is on display at Cyfarthfa Castle Museum & Art Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Welch Fusiliers", "response": ["* Corporal John Collins, First World War (31 October 1917)"]}, {"page": "John Collins", "response": ["John Collins may refer to:", "* John Collins (poet) (1742\u20131808), English orator, singer, and poet", "* John Collins (jazz guitarist) (1913\u20132001), American jazz guitarist", "* John Collins (cartoonist) (1917\u20132007), Canadian cartoonist", "* John Collins (theatre director) (born 1969), American experimental theater director", "* John Collins (Australian musician) (born 1971), bass guitarist for Powderfinger", "* John Collins (musician/researcher), musician in the West African music scene", "* John Collins (Canadian musician), musician with the New Pornographers and the Smugglers", "* John Collins (Bengal Army officer) (died 1807), British colonel in the Bengal Native Infantry", "* John Collins (VC) (1880\u20131951), English sergeant who was awarded a Victoria Cross", "* John Collins (Continental Congress) (1717\u20131795), Rhode Island delegate to Continental Congress", "* John Collins (governor) (1776\u20131822), American manufacturer and Governor of Delaware", "* John Collins (Seattle politician) (1835\u20131903), American politician and businessman", "* John Collins (Andover MP) (1624\u20131711), English academic and politician", "* John Collins (Surveyor General) (died 1795), Surveyor General of Provincial Canada", "* John Collins (Canadian politician) (1922\u20132016), physician and politician in Newfoundland, Canada", "* John Collins (Independent minister) (c. 1632\u20131687), English Independent minister", "* John Collins (priest) (1905\u20131982), radical Anglican canon at St Paul's Cathedral", "* John Collins (nuncio) (1889\u20131961), Irish bishop and diplomat in Liberia", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1942), English professional footballer", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1945), English professional footballer and manager", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1949) (1949\u20132020), Welsh professional footballer", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1968), Scottish international footballer and manager", "* John Collins (New Zealand cricketer) (1868\u20131943), New Zealand cricketer", "* John Collins (Fijian cricketer) (fl. 1895), Fijian cricketer", "* John Collins (sports executive) (born 1961), COO of the National Hockey League", "* John Collins (rower) (born 1989), British rower", "* John Collins (basketball) (born 1997), American basketball player in the NBA", "* John Collins (mathematician) (1625\u20131683), English mathematician", "* John Collins (merchant) (died 1795), merchant in Quebec", "* John Collins Covell (1823\u20131887), American educator and school administrator", "* John Collins (British businessman) (born 1941), former head of National Power", "* John Collins (cocktail), an alcoholic beverage", "* John Collins-Muhammad (born 1991), American politician"]}, {"page": "Battle of Beersheba (1917)", "response": ["The 2/15th Battalion, London Regiment on the right of the 179th Brigade, suffered severely from machine-gun fire; however, when the machine-gun positions were captured all resistance ceased.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 50 The 24th and 25th Battalions of the Royal Welch Fusiliers of the 231st Brigade (74th Division) \"met with stout resistance\" at one location, where the Ottoman soldiers fought to the last man.
