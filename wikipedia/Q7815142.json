His 1938 trip to Mexico to see the effects of the government's campaign of forced anti-Catholic secularisation was paid for by the publishing company Longman, thanks to his friendship with Tom Burns.Graham Greene, Uneasy Catholic Times Literary Supplement, 22 August 2006. That voyage produced two books, the factual The Lawless Roads (published as Another Mexico in the U.S.) and the novel The Power and the Glory. In 1953, the Holy Office informed Greene that The Power and the Glory was damaging to the reputation of the priesthood; but later, in a private audience with Greene, Pope Paul VI told him that, although parts of his novels would offend some Catholics, he should ignore the criticism."]}, {"page": "The Tablet", "response": ["From 1936 to 1967, the review was edited by Douglas Woodruff, formerly of The Times, a historian and reputed wit whose hero was Hilaire Belloc. His wide range of contacts and his knowledge of international affairs made the paper, it was said, essential reading in embassies around the world. He restored the fortunes of The Tablet, which had declined steeply. For many years (1938\u20131961) he was assisted by Michael Derrick, who after the Second World War was often acting editor. Woodruff was followed as editor by the publisher and, like Woodruff, part-owner Tom Burns, who served from 1967 to 1982. Burns, a conservative in his political views, was a progressive on church matters, firmly in favour of the Vatican II church reforms. A watershed came in 1968, when The Tablet took an editorial stance at odds with Pope Paul VI's encyclical Humanae vitae, which restated the traditional teaching against artificial contraception. Burns was followed by the BBC producer John Wilkins, who had been Burns's assistant from 1967 to 1971. Under his editorship the journal's political stance was seen as centre-left. The paper continued to have a distinctive voice, consistently advocating further changes in the church's post-Vatican II life and doctrine. Circulation climbed steadily throughout Wilkins's 21-year tenure. He retired at the end of 2003. Catherine Pepinster, formerly executive editor of The Independent on Sunday, became the first female editor of The Tablet in 2004.The Independent, March 20, 2006.  She said that \"the journal will continue to provide a forum for 'progressive, but responsible Catholic thinking, a place where orthodoxy is at home but ideas are welcome'.\" In 2012 ITV journalist Julie Etchingham became the review's first guest editor, leading a special issue on the CAFOD charity. On succeeding Catherine Pepinster as editor on 12 July 2017, Brendan Walsh said: 'I will do all I can to cherish and protect its values and the quality of its journalism.'"]}, {"page": "Thomas Burns", "response": ["Thomas Burns, Tommy Burns or Tom Burns may refer to:", "* Tom Burns (Australian politician) (1931\u20132007), former leader of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland", "* Tom Burns (footballer) (1916\u20131993), Australian rules footballer", "* Tom Burns (baseball) (1857\u20131902), Major League Baseball player", "* Tom Burns (taekwondo)", "* Tom Burns (bishop) (born 1944), Catholic bishop", "* Tom Burns (sociologist) (1913\u20132001), sociologist, author and founder of the Sociology department at the University of Edinburgh", "* Tom Burns (publisher) (1906\u20131995), British publisher"]}, {"page": "Walter Starkie", "response": ["On any one evening one could count on finding in the Institute at Calle Almagro 5, a great novelist such as P\u00edo Baroja, a rising star like Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela (Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 1989), the essayist Azor\u00edn, composers like Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo and painters such as Ignacio Zuloaga.Tom Burns, The Use of Memory: Publishing and Further Pursuits (1993), pp. 102\u2013103.
