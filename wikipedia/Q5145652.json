He made his league debut for Forest on 29 November 1980 as a substitute in a 1\u20131 draw at Coventry City aged 18. Walsh was picked for the Scottish national team but never played for the full side. Six years after making his debut Walsh moved to Charlton Athletic. Despite playing in the First Division, the club was forced to play home games at Selhurst Park as The Valley had been closed.\nHe helped Charlton stay in the First Division until 1990 when they were relegated. Nevertheless, he remained with the club and etched his name into Addicks history in 1992. Charlton were playing their first game back at The Valley against Portsmouth on 5 December 1992 and Walsh scored the only goal to give Charlton a 1\u20130 win. This historical goal is memorized in a banner in The Valley's north stand carrying Walsh's name and the time of the goal. A very popular player with supporters, Walsh remained with the club until 1996 to complete a decade of service to Charlton before retiring.\nHis brother Derek played for Hamilton Academical and Sligo Rovers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)", "response": ["The European Cup was retained in 1980, this time against Kevin Keegan's Hamburger SV at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. Clough and Taylor then began the process of breaking up the championship winning team, selling off Martin O'Neill, Ian Bowyer, Garry Birtles, and Larry Lloyd; as a new team was built based around youngsters such as Gary Mills, Stuart Gray, Colin Walsh, and Bryn Gunn. New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte. Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league, with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte proving to be unsuccessful. Clough would stay at Forest for another 11 seasons, but without Taylor would only add two League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club's trophy cabinet, and would struggle against alcoholism."]}, {"page": "Darron Gee", "response": ["Gee started his managerial career with Dunkirk, leading them to second place in the Central Midlands League Premier Division in the 1995\u201396 season, thus winning promotion to the Central Midlands League Supreme Division.
