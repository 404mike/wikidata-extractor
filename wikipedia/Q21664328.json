She was an active member of the revolutionary group Inghinidhe na h\u00c9ireann (Daughters of Ireland) and wrote articles for its newspaper, Bean na h-\u00c9ireann, and for Arthur Griffith's newspaper Sinn F\u00e9in.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carlo Tresca", "response": ["In August 1920, Tresca became involved tangentially in the Irish War of Independence. As Sidney Czira, secretary of Cumann na mBan in New York, and sister of Grace Gifford, later recalled, \"Picketing of the British Embassy in Washington had been going on from 1916 onwards and I remember a very successful picketing that was undertaken as a protest in New York against the British arrest of Dr. Mannix in August 1920. This latter picketing was largely the work of an Italian called Carlo Tresca, a personal friend of the well-known Irish-American family of Flynn, who were great friends of James Connolly. Tresca had great influence among the sea-faring fraternity and suggested that we should call out the seamen from the British ships as a protest against the arrest of Dr. Mannix. This was done by pickets walking on the docks with placards, calling on the men to leave the ships. So far as I was concerned, this was rather an amusing incident, because I had a placard which read something like this, \"Hear the call of the blood and refuse to work on British ships\". I realised that the call of the blood was addressed to Greeks, Italians, Lascars, etc., and when they saw a young woman with a placard they came up to enquire what the strike was about. My efforts to translate \"Hear the call of the blood\" into Italian were funny, but I found one word which they all seemed to know was \"tyranny - Irlanda\", and smiling and nodding, they would all walk away. The picketing was extremely effective because when we were holding our meetings it was a thrilling sight when, from time to time, we would hear the march of feet and the crew of some ship would come marching into the room. We found out subsequently that Tresca, who had organised them, was generally supposed to be an anarchist! Of course, there were extremely severe penalties under American law for behaviour of this kind.\"Page 48 of Witness Statement 909 to the Irish BUREAU OF MILITARY HISTORY, 1913-21"]}, {"page": "Operation Shamrock", "response": ["The Save the German Children Society (SGCS) was founded on 16 October 1945 at a meeting in Shelbourne Hall, Dublin, to find foster homes for German children in Ireland. The president was Kathleen Farrell (n\u00e9e Murphy), a paediatrician at whose house Charlie Kerins had been arrested in 1944.  Dan Breen was treasurer. A Garda Special Branch attendee reported some speakers favoured assisting Germany from anti-British sentiment. Hermann G\u00f6rtz, a convicted German spy, became secretary of the SGCS on his release from prison. The SGCS proposed to house Catholic and Protestant children with families of the same denomination, and not to take Jewish children, who it feared would not integrate.  Harry Bodkin became vice president of SGCS in 1948 but was dissatisfied with its preference for Catholic children. Sidney Czira and Eamon Kelly were also members."]}, {"page": "John Brennan", "response": ["* Sidney Czira (1889\u20131974), Irish journalist and revolutionary known by her pen name \"John Brennan\""]}, {"page": "Louie Bennett", "response": ["The Irish women's suffrage movement was largely parallel to the independence movement; as the fighter for both suffrage and freedom John Brennan (Sidney Czira) put it in an interview with RT\u00c9 Television, they pursued different aims, the suffragists wanting to get into the British parliament, and the independence movement wanting to get out of it!"]}, {"page": "List of Irish women writers", "response": ["*Sidney Czira (1889\u20131974), journalist, broadcaster, writer and revolutionary"]}, {"page": "Sydney Criza (n\u00e9e Gifford)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "Sydney Criza", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "Sidney Czira (John Brennan)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "John Brennan (writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "Sydney Czira", "response": ["#Redirect Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "Sidney Gifford", "response": ["#Redirect Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "Sydney Gifford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "Gifford sisters", "response": ["** WS 909 Sidney Czira"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (A\u2013L)", "response": ["*Sidney Czira (1889\u20131974, Ireland/United States), wr. & broadcaster"]}]}}
