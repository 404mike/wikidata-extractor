He had been talent spotted by the Blue Peter team when they filmed an item on the set of Return to Oz; Sundin was playing the part of Tik-Tok. After 77 appearances as a Blue Peter presenter his contract was not renewed. It has since been explained by Biddy Baxter that he attracted complaints from viewers. She stated in her autobiography that homophobia was not the reason for his departure: \"he came across as a whinger.... and an effeminate whinger to boot... it was nothing to do with his sexual proclivities\". Sundin successfully continued his performing career but died from an AIDS-related illness in 1989.", "However, before Bacon, four previous presenters had left the programme when their contracts were not renewed, each for different reasons: these were Leila Williams in 1962, Christopher Wenner in 1980, Michael Sundin in 1985 and Romana D'Annunzio in 1998."]}, {"page": "Janet Ellis", "response": ["Her big break came in 1979, when she landed the job of regular presenter of the Clive Doig-produced Jigsaw.

During her four-year stint, she co-presented with Simon Groom, Sarah Greene, Peter Duncan, Michael Sundin, Mark Curry and Caron Keating. During the run, she became the first civilian woman in Europe to free fall from  - but not before breaking her leg during training. Her last show was on 29 June 1987. It is sometimes claimed that Ellis was sacked from the programme for being unmarried and pregnant with son Jackson, but in recent years Ellis has stated that she was fully supported by the Blue Peter production team and the decision to leave the programme was her own."]}, {"page": "Tik-Tok (Oz)", "response": ["Tik-Tok was a main character in Disney's Return to Oz, adapted from The Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. His legs are very stout and he speaks with his mustache rather than his teeth. In the movie, he is the entire Royal Army of Oz, which is ironic considering his general haplessness, partly from the character's in-book inability to wind up his clockworks for himself. In an interview for the Elstree project, director Walter Murch explained that Tik-Tok's physical performance was created by acrobat Michael Sundin: \"he would put his legs down into Tik-Tok's legs, and then he would bend over looking through his legs, through his thighs, and then he would cross his arms [across his chest] to operate Tik-Tok's arms.\" He used an LCD feed inside the costume to monitor his movements. Due to the heat and physical exertion of being upside-down, according to Murch, Sundin's \"limit was two and half minutes from the moment the lid went on.\" Sean Barrett provided his voice, while Tim Rose remotely-operated the head."]}, {"page": "Simon Groom", "response": ["Groom worked briefly as an English teacher before becoming a disc jockey and joining Blue Peter in 1978.
