After demobilization in 1952 he studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge with a State Scholarship, graduating with a first class degree in Botany, Zoology, Organic Chemistry and Biology in 1955. after graduate work at the Cambridge Department of Chemical Microbiology he completed his PhD in 1958 in biochemistry. Until 1960 he worked as a visiting researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology, at which point he became a researcher at the Glasgow Institute of Virology. In 1968 he became head of the Department of Virology at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, a position he held until 1988 when he returned to the University of Cambridge to join the Pathology Department as a researcher. The same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was awarded the Gabor Medal of the Royal Society in 2005 \"in recognition for his work on the small DNA tumour viruses, specifically the papova virus group, papilloma, polyoma and SV40\". In 1979, he published the first description of the p53 protein and in the following years made essential contributions that showed the significance of this protein to tumorogenesis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "P53", "response": ["p53 was identified in 1979 by Lionel Crawford, David P. Lane, Arnold Levine, and Lloyd Old, working at Imperial Cancer Research Fund (UK) Princeton University/UMDNJ (Cancer Institute of New Jersey), and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, respectively. It had been hypothesized to exist before as the target of the SV40 virus, a strain that induced development of tumors. The TP53 gene from the mouse was first cloned by Peter Chumakov of The Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1982, and independently in 1983 by Moshe Oren in collaboration with David Givol (Weizmann Institute of Science). The human TP53 gene was cloned in 1984 and the full length clone in 1985."]}, {"page": "1979 in science", "response": ["* Tumor protein p53 is identified by Lionel Crawford, David Lane, Arnold J.

The p53 protein was discovered 10 years earlier by several groups, including that of David Lane and Lionel Crawford, Arnold Levine, and Lloyd Old. But there was no evidence that p53 played a major role in human cancers, and the gene encoding p53 (TP53) was thought to be an oncogene rather than a tumor suppressor gene. In 1989, Vogelstein and his students discovered that TP53 not only played a role in human tumorigenesis, but that it was a common denominator of human tumors, mutated in the majority of them. He then discovered the mechanism through which TP53 suppresses tumorigenesis. Prior to these studies, the only biochemical function attributed to p53 was its binding to heat shock proteins. Vogelstein and his colleagues demonstrated that p53 had a much more specific activity: it bound DNA in a sequence-specific manner. They precisely defined its consensus recognition sequence and showed that virtually all p53 mutations found in tumors resulted in loss of the sequence-specific transcriptional activation properties of p53. They subsequently discovered genes that are directly activated by p53 to control cell birth and cell death. His group's more recent studies examining the entire compendium of human genes have shown that the TP53 gene is more frequently mutated in cancers than any other gene ."]}, {"page": "David Lane (oncologist)", "response": ["Lane carried out postdoctoral research first at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) in London with Lionel Crawford and then at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York with Joseph Sambrook.
