He was re-elected five times, holding the seat at the 1904 elections.\nAt the 1906 general election he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bermondsey, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Henry Cust. He then resigned from the LCC. Whilst an MP he voted in favour of the 1908 Women's Enfranchisement Bill.He died in 1909, aged 65. According to his son, he was killed by overwork relating to the People's Budget. He was buried in Charlton Cemetery on 12 October, where the funeral service was so heavily attended that the chapel could accommodate only half of those present.At the resulting by-election for his seat, Alfred Salter, who had succeeded Cooper on the LCC, stood as an Independent Labour Party candidate. The local Liberal organisation in the constituency had been heavily dependent on Cooper and his son, who had run the 1906 campaign. Weakened by his absence, and with the non-Conservative vote split, the Conservative candidate won the seat. However, the Liberals regained it within months, at the general election in January 1910.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|George Cooper"]}, {"page": "Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|1906 || George Cooper || Liberal", "thumb|120px|George Cooper"]}, {"page": "George Cooper", "response": ["George Cooper may refer to:", "* George Cooper (Poole MP) (1626\u20131689), English politician", "* George Cooper (Canadian politician) (born 1941), Canadian Member of Parliament for Halifax, 1979\u20131980", "* George Cooper (Bermondsey MP) (1844\u20131909), Member of Parliament for Bermondsey, 1906\u20131909", "* George Cooper (public servant) (1793\u20131867), first Colonial Treasurer of New Zealand", "* George Cooper (American football) (born 1984), American football player", "* George Cooper (cricketer) (1907\u20132000), Australian cricketer", "* George Cooper (umpire) (1907\u20131980), Australian cricket Test match umpire", "* George Cooper (footballer, born 1932) (1932\u20131994), English footballer for Crystal Palace and Rochdale", "* George Cooper (footballer, born 1996) (born 1996), English footballer for Plymouth Argyle", "* Sir George Cooper (British Army officer) (1925\u20132020), Adjutant-General to the Forces in the United Kingdom", "*George Cooper, Sr., character in Young Sheldon, Sheldon's father", "*George Cooper, Jr., character in Young Sheldon, Sheldon's brother", "* George Cooper (actor) (1892\u20131943), American actor of the silent era", "* George Cooper (organist) (1820\u20131876), English organist", "* George Cooper (poet) (1840\u20131927), American poet", "* Buster Cooper (George Cooper, 1929\u20132016), American jazz trombonist", "* Felix Morrow (1906\u20131988), American political activist and publisher, who used \"George Cooper\" as a pseudonym in the early 1930s", "* George Cooper (Tortallan character), fictional character from Tamora Pierce's Tortall novels"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["| George Cooper", "| George Cooper", "| George Cooper"]}, {"page": "George Joseph Cooper", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Cooper (Bermondsey MP) "]}, {"page": "1909 Bermondsey by-election", "response": ["The by-election was called following the death of George Cooper who had gained the seat as part of the Liberal Party victory in the 1906 general election."]}, {"page": "George Cooper (London politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Cooper (Bermondsey MP)"]}, {"page": "Bermondsey (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=2| George Cooper"]}]}}
