C. Gillies, review of Carmina Gadelica, Highland News, 8 Dec 1901. Although little public criticism was voiced during Carmichael's lifetime, it is clear that other Gaelic folklore collectors and scholars such as Father Allan McDonald, the Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, and Alexander Macbain were uneasy with his earlier treatment of material he had collected.Sti\u00f9bhart, \"Alexander Carmichael and Carmina Gadelica\", p. 30. Eventually, Carmichael's editing methods were roundly challenged in 1976 with the publication of Hamish Robertson's article in Scottish Gaelic Studies, \"Studies in Carmichael's Carmina Gadelica\". Having searched for manuscript copies of charms appearing in the third and fourth volumes, Robertson accused Carmichael of meddling with, altering, and polishing original texts: 'hardly one had not been touched up in some way, sometimes quite drastically'.Robertson, Hamish. \"Studies in Carmichael's Carmina Gadelica\", Scottish Gaelic Studies, xii(2) (1976), p. 231. Robertson's article drew a vigorous rebuff from the Gaelic scholar John Lorne Campbell in the following issue of the journal, although Campbell conceded that '[m]uch of the first three volumes of the Carmina must be taken as a literary and not as a literal presentation of Gaelic folklore'.Campbell, John Lorne. \"Notes on Hamish Robertson's Studies in Carmichael's Carmina Gadelica\", Scottish Gaelic Studies, xiii(1) (1978), p. 13.

This traditional masculine Gaelic name has been Anglicised in various forms of the Biblical name Zechariah.Mackenzie 1903: p. 60. This Gaelic name is peculiar to the Macaulays of Lewis, and to this day it, and its Anglicised forms, are still used by the clan. The Hebridean genealogist Bill Lawson stated that as far as he was aware, the Bernera branch of the Lewis Macaulays was the only branch to still use the name Sg\u00e0ire.Lawson 2008: p. 147. There is, however, little known about this Gaelic name; it is thought to be of Norse origin, however there is no known Norse personal-name that would correspond to Sg\u00e0ire. One possible origin of the name is the Old Norse sk\u00e1ri, meaning \"sea mew\",Hanks; Hodges 2006: p. 409. \"young sea mew\" (from this Old Norse word comes the Scottish Gaelic sg\u00e0ireag, which has a similar meaning).Macbain; Watson 1922: p. 111\u2013112. Alexander Macbain and William J. Watson stated that the Norse word was also used as a byname; later Matheson speculated that the Gaelic personal name Sg\u00e0ire could have begun as a nickname for an individual. This Gaelic name appears in that of an old (possibly pre-Reformation) chapel\u2014Cill Sgaire\u2014in Bragar.

According to early 20th century Gaelic scholar Alexander Macbain, the Tyre in Paul's name does not mean \"Paul, son of Tyre\", but rather \"Paul the Wolf\". Macbain stated that the Gaelic name Mac'ic-tire was a common one during Paul's era, and that the stories of his harrying of Caithness may have contributed to his bearing such a name.Skene 1902: p. 417. Black gave the name's derivation from the Irish mac tire, meaning \"son of the soil (wolf)\".Black 1946: p. 567. Later, William Matheson also considered Mactire to be a byname; although, Sellar stated that it was unclear whether it was a byname or a patronymic name."]}]}}
