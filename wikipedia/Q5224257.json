Thomson was one of a group of young players, including Scott Brown, Derek Riordan and Steven Whittaker, who were given a chance in the Hibs first team at that time.Thomson left Hibs in the 2003 close season, however, for the security of a two-year contract offer from First Division club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
