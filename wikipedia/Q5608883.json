His research focused on the study and treatment of alcohol and other drug dependence and related aspects of addictions. He was a major international figure influencing the development of the discipline of alcohol and drug studies, and promoted rigorous scientific and clinical standards in approaching the broader aspects of these problems.He was director of the Medical Research Council-funded Addiction Research Unit from 1968 until his retirement from King's College London. He also established the UK National Addiction Centre in London and was its first Chair and Director. His 25 years of service as Editor-in-Chief of the journal Addiction transformed it from a small British journal to the most widely-read and cited substance use-related journal in the world. In 1971 he delivered the Edwin Stevens Lecture. Among the many prizes he received in his career was the E.M. Jellinek Memorial Award in 1979 for his research on alcohol use disorders, and, being made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1987 for his services to social science and medicine.Edwards wrote extensively on policy aspects of alcohol and other drug problems and promoted a balanced public health population-based approached to the tackling of alcohol and other drug problems. He wrote the original description of alcohol dependence and the terminology of dependence has become the global term adopted in international disease classification systems including the DSM and ICD classifications.\nEdwards published a wide range of original scientific studies on alcohol and other drugs and also wrote several popular science books including Alcohol, The Worlds Favourite Drug, Matters of Substance: Drugs, and Why Everyone is a User.  He also sole-authored in 1982 the first edition of the influential book The Treatment of Drinking Problems and contributed as an author, co-author, and ultimately advisor to its subsequent editions over the ensuing decades. After his death, the authors of the sixth edition, Keith Humphreys and Anne Lingford-Hughes, renamed the book in his honour as Edwards' Treatment of Drinking Problems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["* Matters Of Substance: Drugs - And Why Everyone's A User by Griffith Edwards"]}, {"page": "Confessions of an English Opium-Eater", "response": ["Yet from the time of its publication, De Quincey's Confessions was criticized for presenting a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers.

The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers\u2014Francis Thompson, James Thomson, William Blair, and perhaps Branwell Bront\u00eb\u2014were led to opium use and addiction by De Quincey's literary example.Berridge and Edwards, p. 53; Lyon, p. 178. Charles Baudelaire's 1860 translation and adaptation, Les paradis artificiels, spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, The Man with the Twisted Lip (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the Confessions. De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.Lyon, pp. 93\u201395."]}, {"page": "Stanton Peele", "response": ["In a review of The Meaning of Addiction, addiction researcher Dr Griffith Edwards stated the following about Peele's work:"]}, {"page": "E.
