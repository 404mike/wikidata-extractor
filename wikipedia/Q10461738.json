He played three times for the Irish Football League representative side.Purves was born in Belfast and played for Glentoran before coming to England to join Small Heath in March 1894. He played in the last three matches of the 1893\u201394 Football League regular season and in the test match that confirmed their ascent to the First Division. He played every game of the club's first top-flight season, but lost his place to Frank Lester in 1895\u201396 and returned to Glentoran. From 1900 he acted as Glentoran's trainer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Purves", "response": ["* Bill Purves (born 1870), Irish professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-one different players represented the club in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and there were nine different goalscorers.

Despite the misgivings of the Daily Post that \"it cannot be expected that eleven or twelve men will stand the strain of a season's work amongst the first division clubs\", no member of the first-choice team missed more than four League matches. Bill Purves and Billy Ollis were ever-present, Ollis for the third season running, and Fred Wheldon missed a match for the first time in five years. Ten other men appeared at least once.
