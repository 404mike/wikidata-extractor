The final three books \"showcase richer roles and more powerful females\": for instance, the series' \"most matriarchal character\", Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of Deathly Hallows, while other women are shown as leaders. Hermione Granger, in particular, develops into an active and independent character essential to the protagonists battle against evil. Yet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and Minerva McGonagall are ultimately placed in supporting roles, and Hermione's status as a feminist model is a matter of debate.
