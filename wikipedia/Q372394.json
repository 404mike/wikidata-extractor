On Broadway, this has happened with Mamet's Race (2009) and Martin McDonagh's A Behanding in Spokane (2010),  although these shows were packaged with stars (Christopher Walken in the latter) and with playwrights who are well established in the profession."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Picture", "response": ["| Graham Broadbent, Pete Czernin, and Martin McDonagh"]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film", "response": ["| Martin McDonagh"]}, {"page": "List of Irish people", "response": ["* Martin McDonagh \u2013 playwright"]}, {"page": "Camberwell", "response": ["Muriel Spark, the author of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and The Ballad of Peckham Rye lived, between 1955 and 1965, in a bedsit at 13 Baldwin Crescent, Camberwell.
