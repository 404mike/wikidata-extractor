He made 24 appearances and scored seven goals for Ireland in a 12-year international career, interrupted by a two-year gap while he played in England (England-based players were not selected for the Ireland national team until 1899).Born in Belfast, Peden began his career with Linfield as a 21-year-old in 1886. He signed for Newton Heath in February 1893, but did not make his debut for the Manchester side until the opening game of the 1893\u201394 season against Burnley on 2 September 1893. Peden left the Heathens at the end of the season to join Sheffield United, but he could not hold down a first-team place with the Yorkshire side, and returned to Ireland to play for Distillery. He finally returned to Linfield in 1898 before retiring at the end of the 1898\u201399 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)", "response": ["|align=left| Jack Peden", "|align=left| Jack Peden"]}, {"page": "Tommy Morrison (footballer, born 1874)", "response": ["Morrison returned to Burnley in February 1897.
