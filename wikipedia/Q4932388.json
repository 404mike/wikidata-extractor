His father joined up with the Devonshire Regiment at the beginning of the second World War and then entered banking once the war was ended. His career meant a number of moves for the Evens family, including a period in Exeter, where Robert attended Hele's School, and a later move to Ilfracombe. He became an Associate of the Institute of Bankers (ACIB) and gained a Diploma in Theology (DipTh).\nEvens followed his father into banking, working at National Westminster in Barnstaple and later in Bristol and Bath, before training for ordination to the priesthood. He was ordained deacon in 1977 and priest in 1978. Evens was previously Archdeacon of Bath in the Diocese of Bath and Wells from 1996 until his consecration to the episcopacy. Bob was consecrated bishop at Westminster Abbey on 30 November 2004 and installed as Bishop of Crediton on 5 December 2004 at Exeter Cathedral; he retired on 31 October 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trinity College, Bristol", "response": ["*Bob Evens - Former bishop of Crediton."]}, {"page": "Maidstone Grammar School", "response": ["* Rt Rev Bob Evens, Bishop of Crediton 2004-2012 "]}, {"page": "Diocese of Gloucester", "response": ["*2013\u2013present: Bob Evens, retired former Bishop suffragan of Crediton, lives in Charlton Kings."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Crediton", "response": ["|align=\"center\"| 2004 ||align=\"center\"| October 2012|| Bob EvensBBC: New Bishop for Crediton || Retired on 31 October 2012.Diocese of Exeter: Bishop of Crediton to retire "]}, {"page": "Archdeacon of Bath", "response": ["*1996\u20132004: Bob Evens (afterwards Bishop suffragan of Crediton)"]}, {"page": "Robert Evens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Evens"]}, {"page": "Evens (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bob Evens (born 1947), English Anglican churchman"]}]}}
