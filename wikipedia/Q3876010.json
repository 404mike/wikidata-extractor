While Zender had not been involved in the album's songwriting, the group chose to scrap his recorded tracks to avoid lawsuits, and Nick Fyffe was recruited for new sessions. This resulted in what was thought to be both a \"tighter, more angry collection of songs\" for Synkronized, and a change of musical direction from \"creating propulsive collections of [long] tunes, [and] speaking out against injustice\". Some of the album's tracks, including \"Canned Heat\", display a hi-NRG and house style, while slower tempos on others were said to \"ease the pressure for [Kay's] more romantic musings\". The album reached number 1 in the UK albums chart and number 28 in the US Billboard 200.
