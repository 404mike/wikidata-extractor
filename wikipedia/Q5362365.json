It was released in 1979.", "Alan Blyth reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in July 1979. The only negative thing that he could find to say about Frederica von Stade's performance of the opera's title role was that she was a mezzo singing music conceived for a soprano. She was \"utterly delightful in her portrayal of vulnerability, in her attention to Massenet's many musical injunctions and her whole-hearted involvement in the part\". She was entirely at home in Massenet's \"enchanting, light-fingered\" style, and expressed every chapter of Cendrillon's story, both sorrowful and joyous, with equal eloquence. Ruth Welting was no less impressive as Cinderella's Fairy Godmother. She sang her glitteringly high music with \"not a note misplaced and every one struck truly and accurately\". She had been an accomplished Philine in CBS's recording of Ambroise Thomas's Mignon \u2013 see Mignon (Antonio de Almeida recording) \u2013 but her F\u00e9e was even better. The album's other three women were all good too, with Teresa Cahill and Elizabeth Bainbridge \"sprightly\" as Cendrillon's stepsisters and Jane Berbi\u00e9 bringing out all the comical villainy of their mother. The set's male principals were less successful. As Cendrillon's father, Jules Bastin was \"sympathetic and idiomatic\" but occasionally unreliable in pitch. Nicolai Gedda's reading of Prince Charming was uncomfortably \"strenuous\", but was defective more fundamentally simply because of his being a man. His musicianship and command of French could not make up for the fact that Massenet had scored the Prince for a mezzo, not a tenor. The Philharmonia Orchestra played as well as they knew how, and Julius Rudel conducted the score \"lovingly, appreciative of both its many delicacies and its romantic heart\". The album was the finest in his entire discography. Its audio quality was mostly satisfactory \u2013 \"a little too recessed\" but also \"spacious and atmospheric\", with neither voices nor instruments allowed undue prominence. The opera itself was \"imbued with warmth, ingenuity and charming colours\", a score offering craftsmanship, magic, gossamer, erotic passion and Massenet \"at his most bewitching\".", "George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in September 1979. Frederica von Stade, he wrote, \"was evidently born to play ... Cinderella. She has a very special kind of voice: a soprano with a luscious downward extension and all of a seamless piece\". Her singing was like \"an unbroken stream of whipped cream\". Ruth Welting was \"scintillating\" as the Fairy Godmother, sounding like a kindly, mirror-universe version of the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberfl\u00f6te. Jane Berbi\u00e9 was \"capital\" as Mme de la Halti\u00e8re, and Teresa Cahill and Elizabeth Bainbridge \"harmonize prettily\" as her daughters, none of them being obliged to perpetrate any Despina-like grotesquery in the interest of comic effect. Jules Bastin's Pandolfe was likeable and well drawn but sung in a voice that was rather dry. Vocal limitations were also an issue with the distinctly mature Nicolai Gedda. He could not sing with the glow, flexibility and ring that had been his fifteen years earlier, but his chivalrous Prince Charming was still an asset to the set. The orchestra presented Massenet's ball, march and pantomime music with \"charm, dash and emphasis\", and Julius Rudel's conducting achieved a laudable precision of ensemble. The album's engineering was exquisite. A star-bright recording of a \"colourful, inventive, sparkling\" score, the album had recovered a forgotten work that eminently deserved its revival.George Jellinek, Stereo Review, September 1979, pp. 89\u201390", "* Elizabeth Bainbridge (mezzo-soprano), Doroth\u00e9e, stepsister of Lucette"]}, {"page": "A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table", "response": ["The original version has been recorded by Heather Harper and Paul Hamburger (L'Oiseau-Lyre); Sarah Walker (Hyperion); and Felicity Lott and Graham Johnson (Naxos).
