Mayer Alter Horowitz and R. Naftali Yehuda Horowitz and his nephew R. Chaim Avrohom Horowitz (1933\u20132016) and his nephew's son R. Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz.  Another descendant of R. Zevi Joshua is R. Elijah Horowitz-Winogradow (1842\u20131878) who served as the Hasidic rabbi of Lida and had several descendants and family members who became prominent members of the Haskalah such as his grandson, the Polish artist Aleksander \u017byw. R. Elijah's sister, Leah is an ancestor of the Beloff family which include Max Beloff, Baron Beloff (1913\u20131999), Renee Beloff (1916\u20131998), Leah Nora Beloff (1919\u20131997), John Beloff (1920\u20132006) and Anne Ethel Beloff-Chain, Lady Chain (1921\u20131991).

Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz of Lublin (1745\u20131815) who is a progenitor of the Chentshin Hasidic dynasty and R. Aaron Horowitz who founded the Strashelye Hasidic dynasty. For this reason, the founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, considered the Horowitz family to be one of the three families of pure lineage in the Jewish nation holding the position of Levites, the other two being the Rappaport family, who are Kohanim, and the Spira family, who are Israelites."]}, {"page": "Anne Beloff-Chain", "response": ["Anne Ethel Beloff was born in 1921 in Hampstead to Semion (Simon) Beloff (born Semion Rubinowicz) and Maria (Marie) Katzin.
