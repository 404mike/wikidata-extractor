Williams made his first-team debut for Millwall during the club's 2005\u201306 season, signing his first professional contract in January 2006. He joined Torquay United on loan in March 2007 in an attempt to play regular first-team football, before returning to his parent club a month later. Williams played over 50 times for Millwall during his two years at the club. Ahead of the 2007\u201308 season, he signed for Yeovil Town for an undisclosed fee, and spent a season with the Somerset club.\nHe joined Brentford in June 2008 on a one-year contract, and helped the club achieve promotion to League One. Williams then joined Torquay United, this time on a permanent basis, but only made four appearances for the club, and was released in December 2009. A spell at Swedish Third Division club \u00d6stersund followed in April 2010, playing seven times before leaving the team in June that year. In October 2010, Williams briefly joined League Two club Stevenage on non-contract terms, but was released two weeks later.\nWilliams signed for Hemel Hempstead Town in early 2011, but soon returned to full-time football with Conference South club Salisbury City. In May 2012, he joined Eastleigh. Williams was released from his contract at Eastleigh just two months into the 2012\u201313 season and subsequently signed for fellow Conference South team Sutton United in October 2012. Williams was loaned out to Tonbridge Angels during the 2014\u201315 season.
