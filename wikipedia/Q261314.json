The film's soundtrack is credited for starting the career of pop singer Christina Aguilera, whose first song to be released in the U.S. was her rendition of \"Reflection\", the first single from the Mulan soundtrack. The song, and Aguilera's vocals, were so well received that it landed her a recording contract with RCA Records. In 1999, she would go on to release her self-titled debut album, on which \"Reflection\" was also included. The pop version of \"Reflection\" has a Polish version (\"Lustro\" performed by Edyta G\u00f3rniak) and two Spanish versions, for Spain (performed by Mal\u00fa) and Latin America (performed by Lucero).
