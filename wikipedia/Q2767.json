Jacksonville was established by European Americans on a 160-acre tract of land in the center of Morgan County in 1825, two years after the county was founded.  The founders of Jacksonville, Illinois consisted entirely of settlers from New England.  These people were \"Yankee\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s.  They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s.  Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal and the end of the Black Hawk War.  The Yankee migration to Illinois was a result of several factors, one of which was the overpopulation of New England. The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household. Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead. As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the Midwestern United States.  When they arrived in what is now Jacksonville there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie, the \"Yankee\" New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.  They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism.  They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian.  Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism and Presbyterianism while some others became Baptist, before moving to what is now Jacksonville.  Jacksonville, like some other parts of Illinois, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart Hall Holbrook University of Washington Press, 1968American Zion: The Old Testament as a Political Text from the Revolution to ...
