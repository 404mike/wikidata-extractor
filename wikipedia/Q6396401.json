Against Oxford University in June, he claimed a second-innings 7/41, comfortably his best first-class innings return.\nHe played just one first-team game in 1970, being almost entirely confined to the Second XI.\nIn 1971, he played a substantial part in Worcestershire's season, appearing in 24 first-class games while scoring 575 runs at just under 20 and taking 32 wickets at a little over 37. He also played 14 List A matches. It was in 1971 that Griffith had his best match for Worcestershire, versus Yorkshire in early June: he made 42 and 59 (his only half-century) and took four second-innings wickets as Worcestershire ran out comfortable winners.In 1972 Griffith played several games early on, including the tour match against the Australians,\nbut was increasingly relegated to the Second XI. Indeed, his last two first-team games \u2014 both in the John Player League \u2014 were 11 weeks apart.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Indian cricket team in England in 1971", "response": ["Wadekar and Gavaskar started the match with tour aggregates of 909 and 811 runs. Just before tea on the first day, Wadekar completed his 1000. At the break he was 98 not out. After Jayantilal fell for two, Wadekar and Gavaskar added 327 for the second wicket. It was a record for the English season, improving on 301 by Phil Sharpe and Doug Padgett for Yorkshire against Glamorgan. Wadekar hit 16 fours, two sixes off Kevin Griffith in his 150 in 321 minutes. His hundred took 234 minutes. India ended the first day on 363 for 2, Gavaskar 188 not out."]}]}}
