In 2014, he signed for Wigan Athletic, where by his own admission, he struggled. He spent the second half of his only Wigan season on loan at Bristol City, playing more consistently as they won League One.\nTavernier signed for then-Scottish Championship side Rangers in 2015, winning a double in his first season. He scored the goal that won Rangers the Championship, and was man of the match as they won the Scottish Challenge Cup scoring a long-range volley in the cup final. At the beginning of the 2018\u201319 season, Tavernier was named as the club captain.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rangers F.C.", "response": ["| James Tavernier || 2018\u2013"]}, {"page": "Milton Keynes Dons F.C.", "response": ["Notable players loaned from other clubs were strikers Patrick Bamford, who scored 18 goals in 37 games, Benik Afobe, who became the league's top scorer in just six months, and \u00c1ngelo Balanta, whose loan spell lasted three years.

Replacements such as James Tavernier and Christian Ribeiro filled the Right-Back position in Simek's absence but upon his recovery he instantly earned his place in the Carlisle team yet again.

New manager Steven Gerrard said that he hoped the dispute would be resolved, and that Wallace would fully recover from his long-term injury. At the outset of the campaign, he was replaced as club captain by James Tavernier. In early September, he was not included in the Rangers squad for the 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League group stage; two days later, it was announced that he and Kenny Miller had won an appeal at a SPFL tribunal against the disciplinary action taken against them five months earlier, with the expectation they would make a financial claim against the club for the fines imposed. He would go on to make three substitute appearances in the 2018\u201319 season, getting a great reception from the Rangers supporters."]}, {"page": "List of Rangers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|James Tavernier"]}, {"page": "List of Rangers F.C. players", "response": ["Since the club's formation in 1872, over thirty players have permanently held the position of club captain for Rangers.
