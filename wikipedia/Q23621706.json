He was born in Berlin and studied at Karlsruhe, Munich and Paris. He was instrumental both in the promotion and utilisation of x-rays as an art historical tool. and was progressive in his efforts to clean old master paintings in a faithful manner that did not impede on original brushstrokes or outlines. He contributed to the progression of both art history and conservation through his making available his detailed notes and photographs. One of his most celebrated restorations is that of Rogier van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, a task he undertook with extreme caution, as it pitted him against Max J. Friedlander, whom he faced down in his approach but who, in the end, was complimentary towards him.He left Germany for England in 1933, following a depreciating political climate. He worked as Art Restorer for the National Gallery, London from 1934, and spent part of the war in Wales and at the Tate Gallery from 1939. Ruhemann is especially noted for the copious notes, detailed letters exchanged with other art historians and the many photographs he kept of his restorative undertakings, all of which greatly broaden our understanding of art historical thinking in the early to mid 20th. century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "International Institute for Conservation", "response": ["When the IIC was founded in 1950, the Founder Fellows were George L.

The earliest recorded restoration was in 1893, the year it was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, but there are no surviving records of the treatment. In the early 1930s, the museum's curator of paintings, Philip Henry, described the painting as an original van der Weyden, but gave the opinion that its poor condition was hindering wider acceptance of the attribution. On this basis, it was sent to Germany in 1932 to undergo conservation. The effort was led by the restorer Helmut Ruhemann, who described the panel as \"structurally sound\", and removed layers of discoloured varnish and \"crude overpainting\", while filling in some areas of paint loss. Ruhemann believed he had found evidence of at least two major 19th-century restorations, one of which was probably that carried out in Boston in 1893. Ruhemann's cleaning and restoration was widely praised, and contributed to the acceptance of the panel as the original by van der Weyden.MacBeth; Spronk (1997), 105\u20136"]}]}}
