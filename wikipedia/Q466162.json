She founded a number of animal advocacy groups, including the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) in 1875 and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) in 1898, and was a member of the executive council of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage.\nShe was the author of a large number of books and essays, including An Essay on Intuitive Morals (1855), The Pursuits of Women (1863),  Cities of the Past (1864), Essays New and Old on Ethical and Social Subjects (1865), Darwinism in Morals, and other Essays (1872), The Hopes of the Human Race (1874), The Duties of Women (1881), The Peak in Darien, with some other Inquiries touching concerns of the Soul and the Body (1882), The Scientific Spirit of the Age (1888) and The Modern Rack: Papers on Vivisection (1889). She also published dozens of essays in most of the leading heavy-weight periodicals of the time, as well as an autobiography and a substantial amount of more popular journalism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 5", "response": ["*  1904   \u2013 Frances Power Cobbe, Irish writer (b. 1822)"]}, {"page": "James Martineau", "response": ["Many portraits of Martineau, including one painted by George Frederick Watts, are held at London's National Portrait Gallery. In 2014, the gallery revealed that its patron, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was related to Martineau. The Duchess' great-great-grandfather, Francis Martineau Lupton, was Martineau's grandnephew. The gallery also holds written correspondence between Martineau and Poet Laureate, Alfred, Lord Tennyson - who records that he \"regarded Martineau as the mastermind of all the remarkable company with whom he engaged\". William Ewart Gladstone said to Frances Power Cobbe \"Dr Martineau is beyond question the greatest of living thinkers\"."]}, {"page": "Philip Wicksteed", "response": ["Wicksteed was a staunch opponent of vivisection. He became an associate of Frances Power Cobbe and supported the anti-vivisection movement.Herford, Charles Harold. (1931). Philip Henry Wicksteed: His Life and Work. J. M. Dent. p. 148."]}, {"page": "Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals", "response": ["The RSPCA lobbied Parliament throughout the nineteenth century, resulting in a number of new laws. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 amended Martin's Act and outlawed baiting. There was a public groundswell of opinions that were divided into opposing factions concerning vivisection, where Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) campaigned on behalf of scientists to conduct experiments on animals while others, such as Frances Power Cobbe (1822\u20131904) formed an anti-vivisection lobby.See Rod Preece, \"Darwinism, Christianity, and the Great Vivisection Debate,\" Journal of the History of Ideas 64/3 (2003): 399\u2013419. Boddice, A History of Attitudes and Behaviours Toward Animals in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain, pp 304-339. The stance adopted by the RSPCA was one of qualified support for legislation.Moss, Valiant Crusade, 154\u2013172. This qualified support for experiments on animals was at odds with the stance taken by Society's founder Broome who had in 1825 sought medical opinions about vivisection and he published their anti-vivisection sentiments.\"Cruelty to Animals\" Morning Post, 10 November 1825, p 1 It was also a departure from the 1837 essay-competition (discussed above) where the essayists were obliged to expose \"the specious defence of vivisection on the ground of its being for the interests of science.\" In 1876 the Cruelty to Animals Act was passed to control animal experimentation. In 1911 Parliament passed Sir George Greenwood's Animal Protection Act. Since that time the RSPCA has continued to play an active role, both in the creation of animal welfare legislation and in its enforcement. An important recent new law has been the Animal Welfare Act 2006."]}]}}
