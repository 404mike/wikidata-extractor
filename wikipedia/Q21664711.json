Maiden was the professional at the Atlanta Athletic Club's East Lake Golf Club, who also trained Alexa Stirling, the three-time winner of the U.S. Women's Amateur, who was five years older than Jones but also a prodigy at East Lake. Jones also received golf lessons from Willie Ogg when he was in his teenage years. Jones played frequently with his father, a skilled player himself. The younger Jones sometimes battled his own temper on the course, but later controlled his emotions as he became more experienced. Jones toured the U.S. during World War I from 1917 to 1918, playing exhibition matches before large crowds, often with Alexa Stirling and Perry Adair, to generate income for war relief. Playing in front of such crowds in these matches helped him, as he moved into national competition a bit later on."]}, {"page": "Alexa Stirling", "response": ["She was coached in golf from a young age at the Atlanta Athletic Club's East Lake Golf Club course by Stewart Maiden, the club's professional, who had learned his golf at Carnoustie, Scotland.

The more young Bobby watches, the more he emulates the better players he sees, such as Stewart Maiden, a club professional originally from Scotland. By the time he is 14, Jones wins the 1916 Georgia State Amateur Championship and makes the quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur that same year. Notable sportswriters of the era such as O.B.

He remained at St. Louis through 1921 as head professional before returning to East Lake. At the 1921 U.S. Amateur, a 19-year-old Bobby Jones was a participant, though he lost in the quarterfinals to Englishman Willie Hunter, the recent winner of the British Amateur. The Jones-Hunter match was well played during the early holes. However, on the 8th hole - the club's Cape Hole, Jones attempted to drive over the trees, which guarded the right side of the fairway. When his ball clipped a tree, it fell into the creek running down the right side, losing the hole. He never recovered and Hunter went on to win the match 2 and 1. In the other quarterfinal matches, Charles 'Chick' Evans downed Jess Sweetser 1up, while Robert A. Gardner defeated Rudy Knepper 4 and 3, and Jess Guilford bettered Harrison Johnston 1 up. With Guilford winning 5 and 4 over Evans in the semifinals, and Gardner defeating Hunter 6 and 5, the Finals pairing was set.

Collett would go on to win a total of six U.S. Women's Amateur Championships, with the last coming in 1935. Stirling, a 3-time U.S. Women's Amateur Champion, was another of the East Lake \"whiz kids\" taught by Stewart Maiden. Collett was a member of the first Curtis Cup team in 1932 and served as Captain on four occasions.

His brother, Stewart Maiden (1886\u20131948), was also a golf professional whose base was at East Lake Golf Club at the Atlanta Athletic Club. Both of the Maiden brothers are credited with helping teach the golf swing to Bobby Jones. It was Stewart Maiden's smooth, silky swing that initially caught Jones' eye, and he said he tried to emulate Stewart's swing."]}, {"page": "Willie Ogg", "response": ["On April 26, 1919, Ogg was paired with the young Bobby Jones \u2013 who had taken lessons from Ogg \u2013 in an alternate shot match held at Druid Hills Golf Club against James Douglas Edgar and Perry Adair. At the time, Ogg was posted as head professional at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta where he succeeded Stewart Maiden who accepted a position at St. Louis Country Club. Jones and Ogg, who had played golf together before, knew each other's game well whereas the pairing of Edgar and Adair did not. Ogg and Jones, who used their previous golf playing partnership to their advantage, were able to prevail in the match by the score of 1 up when Jones holed a putt on the final hole. In June 1919, Ogg partnered with Edgar in a best ball match and beat 17-year-old Jones who on that occasion was paired with Adair."]}]}}
