His best known books are The Environmental Memory \u2013 Man and Architecture in the Landscape of Ideas (1986) and Finnish Architecture and the Modernist Tradition (1998). He was a specialist in the history of the modern architecture of Finland. He was the first person to write critical monographs in any language on three individual Finnish modernist architects, Alvar Aalto \u2013 Alvar Aalto: A Critical Study (1983) \u2013 Reima Pietil\u00e4 \u2013 Reima Pietil\u00e4: Architecture, Context, Modernism (1985) \u2013 and Juha Leivisk\u00e4 \u2013 Juha Leiviska and the Continuity of Finnish Modern Architecture (2001). Already during his lifetime, he acquired a reputation for thorough and innovative scholarship in architecture, bringing a questioning attitude to well-known figures and canonical architectural history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Quantrill", "response": ["*Malcolm Quantrill (1931\u20132009), British architect"]}, {"page": "Reima and Raili Pietil\u00e4", "response": ["The life and career of Reima Pietil\u00e4 has been well charted in the writings of British architectural historian-critics Roger Connah and Malcolm Quantrill, and to some extent also by the Norwegian architect, theorist and historian Christian Norberg-Schulz. Their basic question is to what extent Pietil\u00e4 goes against the grain of a Finnish modernist architecture concerned with rationalism and economy. The whole question is problematic, however, because Finland's most famous architect, Alvar Aalto, was also seen as someone who broke the mold of pure modernism, someone who indeed talked about extending the notion of rationalism. Pietil\u00e4 saw his work as organic architecture, but also very much as modern. Pietil\u00e4 intellectualised his position, and was well-read in philosophy and modern literature. He was very much concerned with the issue of a phenomenology of place, epitomised by the Student Union building Dipoli (1961\u20131966) on the Otaniemi campus of Helsinki University of Technology. This concern for place also extended to his concerns about national identity and Finnishness, even exploring the Finnish language to generate architectural form. The same then applied also for his works abroad, in Kuwait and Delhi. Many of Reima Pietil\u00e4's theoretical writings were published in the journal Le Carr\u00e9 Bleu, a journal he jointly founded in Helsinki in 1958, together with fellow Finnish architects Aulis Blomstedt and Keijo Pet\u00e4j\u00e4, Finnish architecture historian Ky\u00f6sti \u00c5lander, and French architect Andr\u00e9 Schimmerling, whom together formed the CIAM Helsinki group, the Finnish group associated with CIAM (Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne)."]}, {"page": "City of Norwich School", "response": ["* Malcolm Quantrill, Distinguished Professor of Architecture from 1986 to 2007 at Texas A&M University"]}, {"page": "X (magazine)", "response": ["Dannie Abse, Craigie Aitchison, Michael Andrews, Frank Auerbach, Francis Bacon, George Barker, Samuel Beckett, David Bomberg, Yves Bonnefoy, Anthony Cronin, Ren\u00e9 Daumal, Lucian Freud, David Gascoyne, Ghika, Alberto Giacometti, Robert Graves, John Heath-Stubbs, Aidan Higgins, Geoffrey Hill, Philippe Jaccottet, Patrick Kavanagh, Oskar Kokoschka, Malcolm Lowry, Hugh MacDiarmid, Charles Marowitz,Phillip Martin artist, Andr\u00e9 Masson, John McGahern, O.
