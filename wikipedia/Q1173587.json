The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document\u2014an indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists.John Phillip Reid, \"The Irrelevance of the Declaration\", in Hendrik Hartog, ed., Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law (New York University Press, 1981), 46\u201389. As such, it follows the process of the 1550 Magdeburg Confession, which legitimized resistance against Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in a multi-step legal formula now known as the doctrine of the lesser magistrate.Whitford, David, Tyranny and Resistance: The Magdeburg Confession and the Lutheran Tradition, 2001, 144 pages and Kelly OConnell  of Canada Free Press, August 4, 2014, parts II. Magdeburg Confession and III. Doctrine of Lesser Magistrates Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's The Law of Nations, the dominant international law treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was \"continually in the hands of the members of our Congress\".Benjamin Franklin to Charles F.W. Dumas, December 19, 1775, in The Writings of Benjamin Franklin, ed. Albert Henry Smyth (New York: 1970), 6:432. Armitage writes, \"Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood\"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was \"to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States\". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain. The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.Gulf, C. & SFR Co. v. Ellis, 165 US 150 (1897): \"While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty ... it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence.\"Wills, Gary. Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence , p. 25 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002): \"the Declaration is not a legal instrument, like the Constitution\".Cuomo, Mario.

Armitage argues that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of declarations of independence which announced the creation of new states. Other French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (1811), the Liberian Declaration of Independence (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860\u201361), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945). These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original."]}, {"page": "Independence", "response": ["* 1945 to circa 1979, when seventy newly independent states emerged from the European colonial empires and the collapse of the Nazi German Reich and the Empire of Japan;David Armitage, The Declaration of Independence in World Context, Organization of American Historians,  Magazine of History, Volume 18, Issue 3, Pp. 61\u201366 (2004)"]}, {"page": "Richard Hakluyt", "response": ["Hakluyt prepared an English translation of Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius' Mare Liberum (1609), a treatise that sought to demonstrate that the Dutch had the right to trade freely in the East Indies, contrary to Spanish and Portuguese claims of sovereignty over the seas, in the early 17th century.The exact date of the translation is unknown; all that can be said is that it must have been prepared between the publication of Grotius' book in 1609 and Hakluyt's death in 1616: see David Armitage, \"Introduction\", in  Helen Thornton has suggested that the translation was commissioned by Thomas Smythe who became treasurer of the Virginia Company in 1609 and was also Governor of the East India Company. In that year, Hakluyt was a consultant to the Company when it was renewing its charter. Grotius' arguments supported England's right to trade in the Indies.Armitage, \"Introduction\", The Free Sea: see Thornton, \"The Free Sea [book review]\". The translation may also have been part of the propaganda encouraging English people to settle in Virginia. In Mare Liberum, Grotius denied that the 1493 donation by Pope Alexander VI that had divided the oceans between Spain and Portugal entitled Spain to make territorial claims to North America. Instead, he stressed the importance of occupation, which was favourable to the English as they and not the Spanish had occupied Virginia. Grotius also argued that the seas should be freely navigable by all, which was useful since the England to Virginia route crossed seas which the Portuguese claimed. However, it is not clear why Hakluyt's translation was not published in his lifetime. George Bruner Parks has theorized that publication at that time would have been inconvenient to England because after England had successfully helped Holland and Spain to negotiate the Twelve Years' Truce during the Eighty Years' War, the work would have supported English claims for free seas against Spain, but not its claims for closed seas against Holland. Hakluyt's handwritten manuscript, MS Petyt 529, in Inner Temple Library in London was eventually published as The Free Sea for the first time in 2004."]}, {"page": "St Catharine's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|David Armitage"]}, {"page": "National Maritime Museum", "response": ["* 2006: David Armitage Caird Lecture, 2006, by David Armitage: \"The Elephant and the Whale: Empires of Land and Sea\" "]}, {"page": "Harkness Fellowship", "response": ["*Professor David Armitage, transnational historian"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*David Armitage (St Catharine's)"]}, {"page": "Robert Roswell Palmer", "response": ["* The Age of the Democratic Revolution: a political history of Europe and America, 1760\u20131800 (Princeton, vol. 1, 1959; vol. 2, 1964); one-volume edition, with new introduction by David Armitage, 2014; online edition vols. 1\u20132; online free"]}, {"page": "Stockport Grammar School", "response": ["*David Armitage (1965-), Professor of History at Harvard University."]}, {"page": "Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina", "response": ["Because the Fundamental Constitutions were drafted during John Locke's service to one of Province of Carolina proprietors, Anthony Ashley Cooper, it is widely alleged that Locke had a major role in the making of the Constitutions.

However the document was a legal document written for and signed and sealed by the eight Lord proprietors to whom Charles II had granted the colony; because of this, historian Holly Brewer argues that Locke was only a paid secretary and wrote the Fundamental Constitutions much as a lawyer writes a will."]}, {"page": "James A.

Using a close reading of English, Scottish and Irish authors from Sir Thomas Smith (1513\u201377) to David Hume (1711\u20131776), Armitage argues that the imperial ideology was both a critical agent in the formation of a British state from three kingdoms and an essential bond between the state and the transatlantic colonies. Armitage thus links the concerns of the \"New British History\" with that of the Atlantic history. Before 1700, Armitage finds that contested English and Scottish versions of state and empire delayed the emergence of a unitary imperial ideology. However political economists Nicholas Barbon and Charles Davenant in the late 17th century emphasized the significance of commerce, especially mercantilism or commerce that was closed to outsiders, to the success of the state. They argued that \"trade depended on liberty, and that liberty could therefore be the foundation of empire\".Armitage (2000) p. 143 To overcome competing versions of \"empires of the seas\" within Britain, Parliament undertook the regulation of the Irish economy, the Acts of Union 1707 and the formation of a unitary and organic \"British\" empire of the sea. Walpole's opponents in the 1730s in the \"country party\" and in the American colonies developed an alternative vision of empire that would be \"Protestant, commercial, maritime and free\".Armitage (2000) p. 173 Walpole did not ensure the promised \"liberty\" to the colonies because he was intent on subordinating all colonial economic activity to the mercantilist advantages of the metropolis. Anti-imperial critiques emerged from Francis Hutcheson and David Hume, presaging the republicanism that swept the American colonies in the 1770s and led to the creation of a rival power."]}, {"page": "Mare Liberum", "response": ["Mare Liberum was published by Elzevier in the spring of 1609.
