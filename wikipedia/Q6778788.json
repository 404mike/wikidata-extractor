The Art Deco murals created by Eric Ravilious and Mary Adshead in 1934, from inside the pavilion, have all been successfully removed and are currently awaiting restoration. Construction began in 2019 for phase 1 of the pier's construction, representing an area exactly covering the former site of the Golden Goose amusements building: a length of approximately 45 metres. The original cast iron balustrades have been restored and will be reinstated, and replicas have been made of the Pier's original lamp standards, absent from the pier for the last forty years. As of November 2020, the majority of the pier's substructure has been completed, and the pier is expected to open in 2021. Following the completion of this stage, in partnership with Conwy Council, the Victoria Pier Trust will apply for grants to rebuild phase 2, which will be to rebuild the remaining part of the Pier, restored from storage.
