He spent three years at the club without making a first-team appearance, and instead enjoyed loan spells at Bradford Park Avenue, Frickley Athletic, Gainsborough Trinity, Gateshead and Alfreton Town. He was named as Frickley Athletic's Player of the Season for 2012\u201313. He signed with Lincoln City in July 2015, and had loan spells at Southport and Eastleigh, before helping Lincoln to win the National League title in 2016\u201317. He was sold on to Port Vale in January 2018, before moving on to Harrogate Town four months later. He was sold on to Solihull Moors for an undisclosed fee in July 2019 and was named on the 2019\u201320 National League Team of the Year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eastleigh F.C.", "response": ["* Callum Howe"]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["In the January transfer window Aspin allowed two departures, plus Gavin Gunning left the club after rejecting a contract offer and centre-back Tom Anderson was recalled from his loan; incoming were non-league players Dior Angus, Luke Hannant and Callum Howe, as well as loanees Donovan Wilson, Zak Jules, Charlie Raglan and Kyle Howkins. Aspin remarked that the four centre-backs brought in did not cost the club much financially, and that he would have liked to have strengthened in other areas \"but for one reason or another it just hasn't happened\". However he managed to convert Cristian Monta\u00f1o from a winger to a left-back and Antony Kay from a centre-half to a central midfielder, and guided the club to safety with two games to spare. Vale ended the campaign in 20th-place \u2013 the joint-lowest finish in the club's history \u2013 with just one point above the relegation zone, having been out of the relegation zone on goal difference upon Aspin's arrival at the club."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|20||Callum Howe||CB||||Doncaster||||0||0||Academy||1 July 2012||Trainee||2015"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale opened the New Year with a 1\u20130 defeat at second-placed Notts County, and though Aspin was pleased with his players he was highly critical of the referee for his award of a late penalty, calling it \"a really bad decision\". Earlier in the day he made his second signing as manager, bringing in striker Dior Angus from non-league Redditch United. Meanwhile, Gavin Gunning left the club on the expiry of his contract, whilst Jack Stobbs, Rekeil Pyke and Tyler Denton returned to their parent clubs. In contrast, Whitfield's loan was extended until the end of the season. Gunning made his debut for Forest Green on 6 January, and kept a clean sheet as Rovers beat the Vale 1\u20130 with a goal from fellow d\u00e9butante Reuben Reid; Aspin apologized to supporters after the match for the team's performance. Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016. He also boosted the defensive numbers by bringing in centre-back Zak Jules on loan from Shrewsbury Town. Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall. A surprise departure was then announced, as Anderson was recalled early from his loan spell by Burnley. Aspin responded quickly by signing former youth-team centre-back Charlie Raglan on loan from Oxford United, 21-year old defender Kyle Howkins on loan from West Bromwich Albion and 23-year old defender Callum Howe for an undisclosed fee from Lincoln City.", "Vale ended their league campaign with a 5\u20130 defeat at Cambridge United, leaving them in 20th-place \u2013 the joint-lowest finish in the club's history (the other being the 1979\u201380 season). At the end of the season Aspin released ten players \u2013 Chris Regis, Ryan Boot, Luke Dennis, Anton Forrester, Graham Kelly, Kjell Knops, Harry Middleton, Billy Reeves, Joe Slinn and Charlie Walford \u2013 and transfer-listed Tyrone Barnett, Joe Davis, Callum Howe and Rob Lainton, as he attempted to build his own squad for the 2018\u201319 season.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||2||align=\"left\"| Callum Howe", "| 31 January 2018 || CB ||  || Callum Howe || Lincoln City || Undisclosed || ", "| 7 June 2018 || CB ||  || Callum Howe || Harrogate Town || 'small fee' || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Lincoln City F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 January 2018 || CB ||  || Callum Howe || Port Vale || Undisclosed || ", "| 15 August 2017 || CB ||  || Callum Howe || Eastleigh || 15 January 2018 || "]}]}}
