Beresford and Charles Newdegate were the Conservative whips in the House of Commons after the party split over the Corn Laws. His relations with Benjamin Disraeli were strained, with Beresford often taking his cue from Lord Stanley in the Lords instead of the nominal leader in the commons. As Chief Whip he managed the 1852 general election, widely noted for its venality (even by the standards of the day), and was censured by the house for \"reckless indifference to systematic bribery\". Disraeli took the opportunity to remove Beresford, who was briefly succeeded as whip by William Forbes Mackenzie. Mackenzie, however, lost his seat for much the same reason, and was in turn succeeded by Sir William Joliffe. The management of elections Disraeli transferred to his solicitor, Philip Rose.Blake, 322; 352. Beresford was appointed Secretary at War in 1852, and on this occasion was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor."]}, {"page": "Peeblesshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|1837 ||William Forbes Mackenzie||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Second Peel ministry", "response": ["| William Forbes Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Forbes Mackenzie||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Forbes Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "William Forbes", "response": ["*William Forbes Mackenzie (1807\u20131862), Scottish Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*William Forbes Mackenzie; MP for Peeblesshire (1837\u20131852) and Liverpool (1852\u20131853)"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**William Forbes Mackenzie", "**William Forbes Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "Charles Turner (MP)", "response": ["Politically, Turner was a Conservative, and in July 1852 was elected one of Liverpool's two members of parliament, along with William Forbes Mackenzie.

The station was situated on the west side of an unnamed minor road. James Hay Mackenzie, son of the Peebles Railway director William Forbes Mackenzie, wrote to the PR board on behalf of a friend, George Dundas, who was planning to move his family into a house in Earlyvale Gate. He requested that trains should stop at the level crossing for the Dundas family to use them. He asked the PR to either build a station or provide morning and evening trains to stop at the crossing. In return, Dundas promised to bring goods traffic on the line with his family and friends bringing in the revenue from the line. The PR board refused to build a station for one family but they agreed to stop the trains at the level crossing in the morning and evening, but only if William bought a season ticket from  to Edinburgh. Arrangements were made to stop the trains on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (the market days). Any passengers had to inform the gatekeeper at Earlyvale so they could hoist the red stop signal and returning passengers had to notify the guard at Leadburn.
