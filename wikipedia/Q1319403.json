The football associations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales sent a joint letter to FIFA stating that they would not participate, but that they would not object to England participating alone. This agreement was challenged by the BOA, who wanted to select players from all four countries and claimed it would be potentially discriminatory to only select English players. Jim Boyce stated that there is no legal restriction on players being selected by the BOA and the SFA admitted that it would have no legal grounds to prevent Scottish players from participating. It was then confirmed that the FA intended to select players from outside England. Eligible non-English players such as Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey expressed their desire to play in the squad, having posed for a photo-shoot wearing the replica shirts of the team.", "In 2015, the England under-21 coach (Gareth Southgate) and the FA Director of Elite Development (Dan Ashworth) established as FA policy that the Olympic tournament is a valuable experience for underage players. The FA subsequently advised the other home nations that they intended to enter teams in 2016, if either or both of the England teams met the qualification standard. This suggestion was opposed by the Scottish, Welsh and (Northern) Irish associations. Jim Boyce of Northern Ireland, then a vice-president of FIFA, said that he had an assurance that any future Great Britain teams would require the consent of all home nations. The FA then advised the other home nations that they would not enter teams, with the Scottish FA saying that the FA had \"underestimated\" opposition to the plan."]}, {"page": "Kenny Shiels", "response": ["At the start of the 2012\u201313 season, Shiels was given two-match touchline ban by the SFA in June, having served one suspension on the last game of the season and miss one match at the opening game of the season. His touchline ban was given over commenting made about a referee's decisions made in a match between Celtic and St Johnstone. Following a controversial penalty in a 2\u20130 defeat against Hibernian on 16 September 2012, Shiels expressed support of needing TV evidence to be shown and branded Hibernian's player Paul Cairney as a \"diver\". On 28 October 2012, Shiels led Kilmarnock to a historic win at Celtic Park against Celtic. The victory was Kilmarnock's first win in the East End of Glasgow for 57 years and led to prominent Killie fans claiming Shiels is the best thing to ever happen to Kilmarnock. After the match, Shiels praised Kelly, whose father died of a heart attack in March, for performance, making him [Shiels] pleased and also praised two of his youngster's for his performance. A week after a memorable win over Celtic, Shiels would report referee Euan Norris of making inappropriate comments, following a 2-1 default against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, which Norris would send-off Cammy Bell. His support even attracted FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, suggesting that SFA should hire Shiels. His remark also led to Shiels given a five-match touchline ban after disciplinary hearing with the SFA. Following this, Shiels then appealed against his decision, but will serve his touchline ban."]}, {"page": "2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship", "response": ["The draw for the group stage was held on 14 June 2013 in Kaunas, at the Town Hall, and was conducted by the UEFA Youth and Amateur Football Committee chairman, Jim Boyce, who was assisted by final tournament ambassadors Vaida \u010cesnauskien\u0117 and Marius Stankevi\u010dius.
