Hugues Dufourt is commonly credited for introducing the term musique spectrale (spectral music) in an article published in 1979. Murail has described spectral music as an aesthetic rather than a style, not so much a set of techniques as an attitude; as Joshua Fineberg puts it, a recognition that \"music is ultimately sound evolving in time\". Julian Anderson indicates that a number of major composers associated with spectralism consider the term inappropriate, misleading, and reductive. The Istanbul Spectral Music Conference of 2003 suggested a redefinition of the term \"spectral music\" to encompass any music that foregrounds timbre as an important element of structure or language.", "Julian Anderson considers Danish composer Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd's Voyage into the Golden Screen for chamber orchestra (1968) to be the first \"properly instrumental piece of spectral composition\". Spectralism as a recognizable and unified movement, however, arose during the early 1970s, in part as a reaction against and alternative to the primarily pitch focused aesthetics of the serialism and post-serialism which was ascendant at the time. Early spectral composers were centered in the cities of Paris and Cologne and associated with the composers of the Ensemble l'Itin\u00e9raire and the Feedback group, respectively. In Paris, G\u00e9rard Grisey and Tristan Murail were the most prominent pioneers of spectral techniques; Grisey's Espaces Acoustiques and Murail's Gondwana were two influential works of this period. Their early work emphasized the use of the overtone series, techniques of spectral analysis and ring and frequency modulation, and slowly unfolding processes to create music which gave a new attention to timbre and texture.", "Towards the end of the twentieth century, techniques associated with spectralist composers began to be adopted more widely and the original pioneers of spectralism began to integrate their techniques more fully with those of other traditions. For example, in their works from the later 1980s and into the 1990s, both Grisey and Murail began to shift their emphasis away from the more gradual and regular process which characterized their early work to include more sudden dramatic contrasts as more well linear and contrapuntal writing. Likewise, spectral techniques were adopted by composers from a wider variety of traditions and counties, including the UK (with composers like Julian Anderson and Jonathan Harvey), Finland (composers like Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho), and the United States. A further development is the emergence of \"hyper-spectralism\" in the works of Iancu Dumitrescu and Ana-Maria Avram.", "The spectralist movement inspired more recent composers such as Julian Anderson, Ana-Maria Avram, Joshua Fineberg, Georg Friedrich Haas, Jonathan Harvey, Fabien L\u00e9vy, Magnus Lindberg, and Kaija Saariaho."]}, {"page": "Birmingham Contemporary Music Group", "response": ["2005: Julian Anderson: Book of Hours"]}, {"page": "Bayan Northcott", "response": ["Born in Harrow on the Hill (London), Northcott read English at Oxford University and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Oxford in 1962.
