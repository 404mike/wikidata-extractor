He wrote most of the content expressly for the book, though some stories and poems had been published years earlier in the Liverpool music publication Mersey Beat. Lennon's writing style is informed by his interest in English writer Lewis Carroll, while humorists Spike Milligan and \"Professor\" Stanley Unwin inspired his sense of humour. His illustrations imitate the style of cartoonist James Thurber. Many of the book's pieces consist of private meanings and in-jokes, while also referencing Lennon's interest in physical abnormalities and expressing his anti-authority sentiments.", "In 1963, Tom Maschler, the literary director of Jonathan Cape, commissioned American journalist Michael Braun to write a book about the Beatles. Braun began following the band during their Autumn 1963 UK Tour in preparation for his 1964 book Love Me Do: The Beatles' Progress.: Began following during autumn tour; : Love Me Do: The Beatles' Progress.

When he told me John Lennon, I was immensely excited.\" At Braun's insistence, Maschler joined him and the band at Wimbledon Palais in London on 14 December 1963. Lennon showed Maschler more of his drawings, mainly doodles made on scrap pieces of paper that had mostly been done in July 1963 while the Beatles played a residency in Margate.: \"An awful lot of the material was written while we were on tour, most of it when we were in Margate\"; : Margate residency from 8 to 13 July 1963.

He argues that the band's invitation into the British establishment \u2013 such as their interactions with photographer Robert Freeman, director Dick Lester and publisher Tom Maschler, among others \u2013 was unique for pop musicians of the time and threatened to erode elements of the British class system. Prince Philip of the British royal family read the book and said he enjoyed it thoroughly, while Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau described Lennon in 1969 as \"a pretty good poet\"., quoted in . The book resulted in numerous businesses and charities requesting that Lennon produce illustrations. In 2014, the broker Sotheby's auctioned over one hundred of Lennon's manuscripts for In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works from Maschler's collection.
