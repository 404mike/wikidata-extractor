In opposition the Labour party continued to fractionalise: Goodwin resigned suddenly in 1980 and in the following leadership contest the little-regarded left-winger Ken Livingstone was only just beaten in an intensely tactical campaign by the moderate Andrew McIntosh. However the Labour left were strong at constituency level and as the 1981 election approached they worked to ensure that their members were selected to stand and that their democratic socialist anti-austerity convictions shaped the manifesto.", "| Sir Horace Cutler(1912\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "Stoke Newington", "response": ["* Sir Horace Cutler (1912\u20131997), politician\u2014born in the district."]}, {"page": "Conservative Monday Club", "response": ["*Sir Horace Cutler \u2013 Leader of Greater London Council from 1977\u20131981"]}, {"page": "Kelvin MacKenzie", "response": ["MacKenzie was born in Thanet, Kent, to Ian and Mary MacKenzie, both journalists working for The South London Observer.

Cutler was close to Margaret Thatcher (MP for Finchley), who made the right to buy council housing a Conservative Party policy nationally. The policy was largely in place for the 1974 Conservative manifesto but did not prove an asset in the two general elections that year because of high interest and mortgage repayment rates as well as the growth of negative equity as house prices fell."]}, {"page": "Members of the Greater London Council", "response": ["* Horace Cutler (C): Harrow 1964\u20131973; Harrow West 1973 \u2013 31 March 1986"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Monday Club publications", "response": ["* Rents - Chaos or Commonsense?, by Horace Cutler 1970.
