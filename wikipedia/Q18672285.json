Saturday 11 February 1792 saw the first of Samuel Harrison and Charles Knyvett's Vocal Concerts, a series that would continue until 1821. Between 1845 and 1858, John Ella's Musical Union gave eight concerts a year of chamber music in the rooms. Hector Berlioz was on the podium at the rooms on 7 April 1848 when he conducted his \"Hungarian March\" from La damnation de Faust at a concert of the Amateur Musical Society. And the Quartet Association (which included the 'cellist Alfredo Piatti and the pianist/conductors Charles Hall\u00e9 and Sterndale Bennett) gave concerts at the Rooms between 1852 and 1855 in an attempt to popularise chamber music."]}, {"page": "Charles Incledon", "response": ["The faultless sweetness and perfection of Samuel Harrison (who sang mostly in oratorio and ballad concertsP.

Michael Kelly, despite his 'Hibernian elasticity', and his association with very distinguished European musicians, owed his later popular favour as much to his useful endeavours in theatrical management, but as a singer in the English mould was less substantial."]}, {"page": "Oh Dear!

In 1791, again in partnership with Harrison, and with the additional assistance of his brother William, he established at Willis's Rooms the Vocal Concerts, which were successfully carried on for three years. He was appointed in 1796 organist of the Chapel Royal. In 1801, with the co-operation of his brother William, his son Charles, Thomas Greatorex and James Bartleman, he revived the Vocal Concerts at the Hanover Square Rooms, but in the following year he withdrew from the management.

He sang at the Three Choirs Festivals from 1805 to 1836, and took part in the British premi\u00e8re of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in 1825.
