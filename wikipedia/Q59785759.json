Thurtle stated that the primary cause of abortion was a \"high degree of fertility\", a \"stark reality\" facing all fertile women, and argued that because many married women would face pregnancy every one or two years until their menopause, withholding access to fertility advice and birth control was \"a form of class discrimination and penalisation\", particularly as maternal death rates rose rapidly after the fifth child. Thurtle's report asserted that abortion was not riskier than childbirth or amateur operations, a view the British Medical Association agreed with \u2013 evidence from 95 practitioners provided to the committee by Arthur Leyland Robinson concluded that \"setting aside all sentimental and ethical objections, legalised abortion ... would not produce any ... disadvantages and dangers inseparable from operations for the interruption of pregnancy\". Based on this, the minority report proposed the creation of local authority birth control clinics and the legalisation of abortion in various circumstances where the woman's life was not in immediate danger: for women who had already had four pregnancies, on eugenical grounds, and in cases of sexual crime, such as rape."]}]}}
