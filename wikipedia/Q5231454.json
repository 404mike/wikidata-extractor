Due to his hasty departure, he accidentally kept a key to a storage locker believed to contain the binoculars intended for use by the crow's nest lookout. The absence of any binoculars within the crow's nest is believed to be one of the main contributory factors in the Titanic\u2019s ultimate demise.", "link_mentions": {}}}
