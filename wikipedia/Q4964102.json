A mathematician by training, his research has focused on understanding atmospheric motion from the scale of fronts to that of the Earth, using a range of theoretical and numerical models. He is perhaps best known for his work on the mathematical theory of extratropical cyclones and frontogenesis, particularly through the use of potential vorticity. He has also produced research across many areas of meteorology, including the Indian monsoon and global warming, recently contributing to the Stern review and the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of meteorologists", "response": ["*Brian Hoskins"]}, {"page": "University of Reading", "response": ["* Sir Brian Hoskins \u2013 Professor of Meteorology, University of Reading and Director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London"]}, {"page": "Hoskins", "response": ["* Brian Hoskins (born 1945), British meteorologist and climatologist", "* Brian Hoskins (born 1943), British Red Arrows Captain"]}, {"page": "Royal College of Science Union", "response": ["The RCSU Science Challenge is a scientific writing competition created in 2006 by the presidents of the newly-reformed RCSU, Kilian Frensch and Mariko Tavernier.
