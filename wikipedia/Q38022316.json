The floating child-stone-head is a visitor in Sophia\u2019s body \u2013 though there\u2019s no knowing which part: is it a floater in her eye as well as a hallucination?. All this is the bounty of Sophia\u2019s imagination, which complicates her role as the commercial, conventional antagonist to her sister Iris, the wild child who left home to be an activist and chained herself to the fence at Greenham Common. And there is no answer to the quarrel between the sisters, which is based on ideas of the individual\u2019s role in the world. \u201cI hate you,\u201d they tell each other, and Sophia rests her head on Iris\u2019s chest. Little is resolved at the end, but the novel works through correspondences that jump across bounds and make accord between unlike things.
