National Flying Services had already suggested the site as a municipal airport to the local council in 1930, but they declined. Gandar Dower had the idea of opening a flying school there and in 1933 he had started work levelling the land, installing an electricity supply and building a hangar. He established four companies: Aberdeen Flying School, which would also run the airfield, Aberdeen Flying Club, Aberdeen Aerodrome Fuel Supplies for ground support operations, and an airline, Aberdeen Airways. He was in quite a hurry to get going because Highland Airways had been established at Inverness in 1933 and Ted Fresson, its founder, was looking at also setting up in Aberdeen.", "thumb|Rapide G-AIDL was used post-war by Eric Gandar Dower, and is still active in 2020", "|Delivered new to Eric Gandar Dower but also used by the airline, it was seized by High Sheriff of Oxfordshire and auctioned.

Gandar Dower had recently established Aberdeen Dyce airport but had denied Fresson the use of it, forcing Highland Airways to make other arrangements to serve the city. There had been a gentleman's agreement that Highland Airways would operate to the north of Aberdeen and Aberdeen Airways would operate to the south, but with the railways dominating routes to Glasgow, Edinburgh, and onwards to London, the southern routes were unprofitable, so Gandar Dower turned his attention to the Northern Isles and their competition continued until their later merger into British Airways. Fresson moved from Seaton to a new airfield at Kintore, where he had built a new hangar, moving in on 22 May 1935."]}, {"page": "Scottish Airways", "response": ["The coverage of Scotland was not complete, however, largely because of the intransigence of Eric Gandar Dower, the founder of what was now Allied Airways (Gandar Dower), based at the airport he founded and owned; Dyce at Aberdeen. He was operating routes to the Northern Isles in competition with Fresson. He refused to allow competing airlines access to his airport, and rejected any thoughts of co-operation with or investment by anyone else, a situation that endured until all private airlines were nationalised after World War II.", "In 1938 the Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) had been established by the government to license scheduled airline services and civil airports, as part of the effort to improve the British aviation industry spurred by the Maybury Committee report of 1936. Other areas of activity were to improve navigation, air traffic control and radio aids, weather reporting, pilot training and certification, and airport facilities. In order to rationalise airline routes to provide good service without needless, wasteful and often damaging competition, many small airlines closed or merged, and larger, better financed operations thrived. Scottish Airways was performing valuable services for the Highlands and Islands, and its routes were largely unaffected, but one decision the ATLA took, in February 1939, was to stop their competition on routes to Aberdeen, leaving that city's routes to Eric Gandar Dower's Allied Airways.  As a condition of licence approval, airlines had to commit to providing their aircraft for government use in the event of national emergency."]}, {"page": "Midland & Scottish Air Ferries", "response": ["Most of the routes were stopped on 14 July 1934, with no obvious attempt to sell the airline as a going concern, the aircraft being disposed of individually over the following months.

Gandar Dower was possibly evaluating the route with a view to taking it over, but nothing came of it. The only remaining route, to Islay, was shut down on 30 September."]}]}}
