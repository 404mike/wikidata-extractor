Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal and agnostic theologies and to writers such as David Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach, who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical texts.

Its first aim was \"to furnish working men with gardens, as healthy occupations, and to help them to counteract in part the ill-effects of confinement at the loom.\" It leased land on four sites, sufficient for 400 gardens, and had about 1,000 members, each of whom paid a penny a week towards the expenses of the Society, which enabled it to make loans to members, trade in coal, rent a flour mill, open a shop and pay interest to members on their shares. The Society was \"wrecked\" by its readiness to grant credit to its members. When Coventry's ribbon industry went into a steep decline in 1859 many of the Society's members were unable to pay their debts and about 1862 it collapsed.
