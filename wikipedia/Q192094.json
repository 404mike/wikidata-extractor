Two electronic games have been released with Iron Maiden soundtracks, and the band's music is featured in a number of other video games.", "Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which reminded him of the iron maiden torture device. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland, Stratford. A few decades later the pub in Maryland was officially named \"The Birthplace of Iron Maiden\" and turned into a music pub with many mementos of the band's early years as part of London's rock music history.", "thumb|left|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.", "Harris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris stated, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\" At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.\"", "To promote the album, the band hosted an evening of television, radio and press interviews at Castle Schnellenberg in Attendorn, Germany prior to the record's release, before holding a small number of \"secret\" club shows, under the name \"Charlotte and the Harlots\", at Empire, Cologne and L'Amour, New York. In May, the group set out on a supporting tour which saw them performing 103 shows to well over two million people worldwide over seven months. To recreate the album's keyboards onstage, the group recruited Michael Kenney, Steve Harris' bass technician, to play the keys throughout the tour, during which he would perform the song \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" on a forklift truck under the alias of \"The Count\" (for which he would wear a black cape and mask). Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's Brave New World. Stage set and equipment which has been taken by band was transported in dozens of trucks and was the most elaborate to date and one of the biggest in the world including over 200,000 watts of PA and over 1,500 spot lamps. Iron Maiden was included in the Guinness Book of World Records Museum for its performance at the Monsters of Rock festival in 1988.Guinness Book of Records 1990 ed. p. 155.", "Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards. Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years. The album, No Prayer for the Dying, was released in October 1990. It contained hit singles as \"Holy Smoke\" and \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", the band's first (and to date, only) UK Singles Chart No.\u00a01, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown. In 1990 Bruce Dickinson received the Golden Raspberry Awards in category The Worst Original Song for the band's most successful single in Great Britain. The album debuted at No.\u00a02 in the UK albums chart and No.\u00a017 on the Billboard 200. No Prayer for the Dying signalled the return of Iron Maiden to the roots of theirs musical style, in particular in its simplicity of composition and raw sound.", "In 1993, Bruce Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package). The first, A Real Live One, featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, A Real Dead One, featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone. Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", and that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour. On May 1, 1993 the band performed at the \"Primo Maggio Free Festival\" in Rome, Piazza San Giovanni. According to different sources the crowd was estimated between 500,000 and one million people. The band toured an extensive Italian leg and visited Russia for the very first time, playing three consecutive nights at Moscow's Olympic Stadium. Bruce Dickinson played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on August 28, 1993. The show was filmed, broadcast by the BBC, and released on video under the name Raising Hell.", "After a three-year hiatus from studio releases \u2013 a record for the band at the time - Iron Maiden returned in 1995. Releasing their next studio album, The X Factor, the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No.\u00a08),. The album would go on to win Album of the Year awards in France, Spain and Germany. After more than ten years of the Iron Maiden's constant domination in the readers' polls of Kerrang! magazine, band's founder Steve Harris received the prestigious Kerrang Kreativity Award. The record included the 11-minute epic \"Sign of the Cross\", the band's longest song since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", as well as the singles \"Man on the Edge\" (based on the film Falling Down), and \"Lord of the Flies\", based on the novel of the same name. The release is notable for its \"dark\" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce. The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania in Europe and ending in the Americas. The biggest show of the whole tour was a headline appearance for 60,000 people at the Monsters of Rock festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.", "In 1998 Iron Maiden released Virtual XI, whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history. The album peaked at No.\u00a016 in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record. At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including Live at Donington (which was given a mainstream release for the first time). Virtual XI features the singles \"The Angel and the Gambler\" and \"Futureal\", as well as epic opus entitled \"Clansman\" and the power ballad \"Como Estais Amigos\" dedicated to all people who died in Falklands War.", "While the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band. Although Harris admitted that he \"wasn't really into it\" at first, he then thought, \"'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce and we know what he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.' I mean, we got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so\u00a0... after I thought about it, I didn't really have a problem with it.\"", "Following announcements that the band had begun composition of new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing, The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March and featured three singles \"The Final Frontier\", \"El Dorado\" and \"Coming Home\", as well as epic, progressive opuses such as \"Isle of Avalon\", \"The Talisman\" and \"When The Wild Wind Blows\". The album, the band's fifteenth, was released on 16 August, garnering critical acclaim and the band's greatest commercial success in their current history, reaching No.\u00a01 in twenty-eight countries worldwide. The Final Frontier debuted at No. 4 on Billboard 200 reaching the highest American album charts position to date. Although Steve Harris had been quoted in the past as claiming that the band would only produce fifteen studio releases, band members have since confirmed that there will be at least one further record. The album was band's next commercial success, achieving Gold or Platinum status in 24 countries around the world. Iron Maiden were awarded with the special sales recognition plaque for selling over 750,000 of their albums in Finland.", "On 15 February 2012, the band announced their third retrospective Maiden England World Tour 2012\u201314, which was based around the video of the same name. The tour commenced in North America in the summer of 2012 and was followed by further dates in 2013 and 2014, which included the band's record-breaking fifth headline performance at Donington Park with 100,000 fans in attendance, their first show at the newly built national stadium in Stockholm, a return to the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, and their debut appearance in Paraguay. In August 2012, Steve Harris stated that the Maiden England video would be re-issued in 2013, with a release date later set for 25 March 2013 in DVD, CD, and LP formats under the title Maiden England '88.", "Iron Maiden frequently use the slogan \"Up the Irons\" in their disc liner notes, and the phrase can also be seen on several T-shirts officially licensed by the band. It is a paraphrase of \"Up the Hammers\", the phrase which refers to the London football club, West Ham United, of which founder Steve Harris is a fan. Collection called \"Die With Your Boots On\" was published in 2020 as the result of a unique collaboration between Iron Maiden and West Ham United. Band's mascot is the official symbol of For\u00e7a Jovem youth soccer club Vasco.", "Iron Maiden's distinct logo has adorned all of the band's releases since their debut, 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP. The typeface originates with Vic Fair's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris claims that he designed it himself, using his abilities as an architectural draughtsman. Metal Lord / Iron Maiden, a characteristic font known from the group's classic logo, disseminated around the world by graphic works related to the band's activities, has found its way into pop culture for good, becoming a motif commonly used to create various logos and inscriptions. The band's characteristic graphic motifs have appeared on huge stadium banners many times during football games in many countries around the world. The song \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" (from Monty Python's Life of Brian) is a staple at their concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.", "M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold stated that Iron Maiden \"are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless\", while Trivium singer Matt Heafy comments that \"without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist\". Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor said that \"Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do. And Bruce Dickinson? Dude! To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer. He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman. Everything made me a fan. And there wasn't a dude that I hung out with that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks\", while their music also helped Jesper Str\u00f6mblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds. Viking metallers of Swedish band Amon Amarth stated Iron Maiden is one of their biggest influence also participated in Iron Maiden's Legacy of the Beast RPG game project. Chris Impellitteri stated Iron Maiden have influenced \"virtually every heavy metal band in existence with their music, brand, and of course talent!\"", "Steve Harris is considered one of the most influential musicians and composers in heavy rock history. He is also the author of the lion's share of the Iron Maiden's repertoire and the creator of the archetypal composition pattern in modern metal. In addition to writing riffs, vocal melodies and lyrics for most songs, he was also involved in audio-visual production and editing. The riffs created by him are among the most unforgettable in history, as evidenced by compositions such as \"The Trooper\", \"The Number of the Beast\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", \"Run to the Hills\", \"Fear of the Dark\" or \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". The creator of Iron Maiden has been repeatedly named the best and most influential metal bassist of all time. He is also the originator of extremely expressive, galloping bass lines. His compositional style is based on triplets consisting of sixteenths and eighth notes, creating intense rhythmic background for a double (then triple) guitar attack. Steve Harris is one of the few bass players who can play extremely fast and dense \u2013 only with his fingers! This ability has become a sensation in the context of the entire heavy metal scene. According to the Ultimate Classic Rock editors \"technically it was incredibly impressive to achieve so much speed and dynamics in the sound without using a standard pick\". The founder of Iron Maiden inspired masses of future musicians, including such thrash metal bassists as Frankie Bello of Anthrax, and former and current Metallica bassists Cliff Burton, Jason Newsted, and Robert Trujillo.", "Contrary to the accusations, the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, \"It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.\" Harris has also stated that \"The Number of the Beast\" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching Damien: Omen II, and also influenced by Robert Burns' \"Tam o' Shanter\". Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.", "Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, has stated that his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Queen, Heart and Wishbone Ash. In 2010 Harris stated, \"I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\" In 2004, Harris explained that the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\" On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar,\" cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills.\"", "Throughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's Somewhere in Time, keyboards on 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and an attempt to return to the \"stripped down\" production of their earlier material on  No Prayer for the Dying. In recent years, however, the band have begun using more progressive elements in their songs, which Steve Harris describes as not progressive \"in the modern sense, but like Dream Theater, more in a 70s way\". According to Harris, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the band's first album which was \"more progressive\", while they would only return to this style from 1995's The X Factor, which he states is \"like an extension of Seventh Son..., in the sense of the progressive element to it\". The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material, which AllMusic states was \"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock\", although Harris firmly denies this.", "* Steve Harris \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1975\u2013present), keyboards (1988, 1998\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "The Number of the Beast (album)", "response": ["The Number of the Beast is Iron Maiden's only album to include songwriting credits for Clive Burr, and was the band's first album to feature writing by guitarist Adrian Smith. In addition, the release saw Steve Harris adopt a different approach to writing, which would cater more for new vocalist Bruce Dickinson. The album's producer Martin Birch remarked, \"I simply didn't think [former vocalist Paul Di'Anno] was capable of handling lead vocals on some of the quite complicated directions I knew Steve wanted to explore\u00a0... When Bruce joined, it opened up the possibilities for the new album tremendously.\"", "As they had written too much material, they had to choose between \"Total Eclipse\" and \"Gangland\" for the \"Run to the Hills\" B-side, with the understanding that the other song would appear on the album. Several band-members have since expressed regret over the decision, with Steve Harris commenting, \"We just chose the wrong track as the B-side. I think if 'Total Eclipse' had been on the album instead of 'Gangland' it would have been far better.\" On top of this, Harris has stated that the record's opening track, \"Invaders\", was not good enough, commenting that it \"could have been replaced with something a bit better, only we didn't have anything else to replace it with at the time. We had just enough time to do what we did, and that was it.\"", "While the title track was considered by many religious groups in the United States as evidence that Iron Maiden were a Satanic band, the song was in fact inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the film Damien: Omen II late at night. In addition, Harris has stated that the lyrics were also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. The track opens with a spoken introduction from the Book of Revelation, read by actor Barry Clayton. According to Dickinson, the band originally approached Vincent Price to record the passage, but were unwilling to pay Price's fee of \u00a325,000. Although the liner notes state that the passage is from Revelations 13:18, the first line comes from 12:12.", "\"22 Acacia Avenue\" is the second song in the \"Charlotte the Harlot\" saga, which was originally written by Adrian Smith several years earlier, while playing in his old band, Urchin.

Murphy also praised the additional material featured on the release, finding that the new content was \"where a great album gets even better\".
