With Charles Rolls (1877 \u2013 1910) and Claude Johnson (1864 \u2013 1926), he founded Rolls-Royce.\nRolls-Royce initially focused on large 40-50 horsepower motor cars, the Silver Ghost and its successors. Royce produced his first aero engine shortly after the outbreak of the First World War and aircraft engines became Rolls-Royce's principal product.\nRoyce's health broke down in 1911 and he was persuaded to leave his factory in the Midlands at Derby and, taking a team of designers, move to the south of England spending winters in the south of France. He died at his home in Sussex in the spring of 1933.", "link_mentions": {}}}
