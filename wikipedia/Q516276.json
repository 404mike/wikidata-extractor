With Charles Rolls (1877 \u2013 1910) and Claude Johnson (1864 \u2013 1926), he founded Rolls-Royce.\nRolls-Royce initially focused on large 40-50 horsepower motor cars, the Silver Ghost and its successors. Royce produced his first aero engine shortly after the outbreak of the First World War and aircraft engines became Rolls-Royce's principal product.\nRoyce's health broke down in 1911 and he was persuaded to leave his factory in the Midlands at Derby and, taking a team of designers, move to the south of England spending winters in the south of France. He died at his home in Sussex in the spring of 1933.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 22", "response": ["*1933 \u2013 Henry Royce, English engineer and businessman, co-founded Rolls-Royce Limited (b. 1863)"]}, {"page": "March 27", "response": ["*1863 \u2013 Henry Royce, English engineer and businessman, founded Rolls-Royce Limited (d. 1933)"]}, {"page": "Peterborough", "response": ["Peterborough is the birthplace of many notable people, the astronomer George Alcock, one of the most successful visual discoverers of novas and comets;Obituary of George Eric Deacon Alcock  Journal of the British Astronomical Association, vol.111 no.2 (pp.64\u201366) February 2001.

It included residential development that is now Surrey Square and the Paragon, which were designed by Michael Searles in 1788. The main road route gave rise to ribbon development because of the increasing urbanisation of the expanding metropolitan area. In the early-20th century, social housing was built on land previously held by the family who gave away their interests for public benefit including the library at Wells Way in Burgess Park, the girls grammar school at Bricklayers Arms (St Saviour's and St Olave's School) and the Peabody Estate (Dover Flats and Waleran Flats). The last significant remnant of their involvement is the detached White House between the Peabody Estate buildings, built by Searles in the 1790s. The original railings and ironwork survive in the current development at No.\u00a0155.  The house was later occupied by Searles and became the management office of the Rolls family trust estates.

In 1905, Lanchester produced a 20\u00a0hp four-cylinder engine, and in 1906 he produced a 28\u00a0hp six-cylinder engine. Although Sir Henry Royce had already tackled the problem of crankshaft torsional oscillation and consequent vibration in straight-6 engines, Lanchester analysed the problem scientifically and invented the torsional crankshaft vibration damper as a solution to the problem of engine balance. His design, patented in 1907, used a secondary flywheel coupled to the end of the crankshaft with a viscous clutch. At around the same time Lanchester also patented a harmonic balancer to cancel out the unbalanced secondary forces in a four-cylinder engine, using two balance weights rotating at twice crankshaft speed in opposite directions."]}, {"page": "Rolls-Royce Holdings", "response": ["Rolls-Royce grew from the engineering business of Henry Royce which was established in 1884 and ten years later began to manufacture dynamos and electric cranes.
