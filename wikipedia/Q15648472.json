Coote made his final appearance in December 1963 and retired in April 1964, having made 559 appearances for Brentford. Coote's career virtually ran in parallel with goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread and both players were named on the team sheet together 357 times. He remains the club's record appearance-maker and (rarely for a defender) was never booked in his career. Coote was offered opportunities to continue his career in non-League football, but chose to remain in retirement. He was awarded a second testimonial versus West Ham United, managed by Ron Greenwood, in September 1965, from which he earned more than \u00a31,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ).

Though he managed five further appearances during the second half of the season, the injury ended Brodie's professional career.

A new youth team, named Brentford Town Juniors, was launched in 1948 and won the Hounslow Minor Shield in its inaugural season. Products of the team included Alan Bassham, George Bristow, Roy Hart and George Lowden. The youth team reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup in 1952\u201353, succumbing 8\u20131 on aggregate to the eventual winners Manchester United. Under the stewardship of Alf Bew and because of the financial constraints imposed on the first team, the youth team of the early 1950s was particularly productive, yielding Vernon Avis, Johnny Pearson, Gerry Cakebread, Dennis Heath, Jim Towers and George Francis. Following financial problems in 1967, the youth team was disbanded, but was revived again in 1972 with money raised by supporters. The youth team won a youth tournament in Frankfurt the following year, beating Frem in the final, with Richard Poole top-scoring. Along with Poole, Kevin Harding and Roy Cotton progressed to play league football with the first team, while Gary Huxley won England Youth international honours. The youth team ceased playing competitive fixtures at the end of the 1973\u201374 season.", "* Gerry Cakebread", "|Gerry Cakebread"]}, {"page": "Gordon Phillips (footballer)", "response": ["Phillips joined Third Division club Brentford during the 1963 off-season. He had a difficult start to life at Griffin Park, conceding 13 goals in his first two youth and reserve matches. An injury to Gerry Cakebread and poor performances by his deputy Fred Ryecraft saw manager Frank Blunstone hand Phillips his first team debut in an FA Cup first round match versus Margate at Griffin Park on 16 November 1963. Phillips conceded two goals in the 2\u20132 draw and it was his only appearance of the 1963\u201364 season.
