The first natural tropolone derivatives were studied and purified in the mid-1930s and early-1940s. Thuja plicata, Thujopsis dolabrata, Chamaecyparis obtusa, Chamaecyparis taiwanensis and Juniperus thurifera were in the list of trees from which the first tropolones were identified. The first synthetic tropolones were thujaplicins derived by Ralph Raphael."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Ralph Raphael"]}, {"page": "David Rubio", "response": ["David Rubio was born on 17 September 1934 in London, England. He acquired his new surname in his twenties while professionally playing flamenco guitar, which he had learned studying in Seville with, among others, the  guitarist Pepe Mart\u00ednez.  In the early 1960s he traveled from Spain to New York as accompanist for the Rafael de Cordoba flamenco dance company.  While in New York, Rubio abandoned playing in favor of the construction of guitars and established his first workshop on Carmine Street in New York's Greenwich Village. Eventually he returned to England and set up a workshop in Duns Tew near Oxford, later relocating it to Cambridge. Over time he expanded his repertoire to include the various other instruments mentioned above. Rubio investigated many aspects of the technology of instrument-making, in his attempt to re-create the classical sound and appearance of the old Cremonese instruments. Some of this work was published in Nature, following a collaboration with Professor Ralph Raphael and other Cambridge University scientists: they identified components used in the surface treatment of the wood of instruments made by Stradivarius and showed that a version of these substances could be used to improve the tone of modern instruments."]}, {"page": "Ralph Alexander Raphael", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ralph Raphael"]}, {"page": "Ralph A.

Don, commonly called as Western red cedar tree. These compounds were also identified in the constituents of Chamaecyparis obtusa, another species from the Cupressaceae family. C. obtusa is native to East Asian countries including Japan and Taiwan, and is also known as Taiwan hinoki, from which the \u03b2-thujaplicin was first isolated in 1936 and received its name, hinokitiol. Thujaplicins were the first natural tropolones to be made synthetically, by Ralph Raphael and colleagues, and the \u03b2-thujaplicin was the first non-benzenoid aromatic compound identified, by Tetsuo Nozoe and colleagues. The resistance of the heartwood of the tree to decay was the main reason prompting to investigate its content and identify the compounds responsible for antimicrobial properties. \u03b2-thujaplicin gained more scientific interest beginning in the 2000s. Later, iron-binding activity of \u03b2-thujaplicin was discovered and the molecule has been ironically nicknamed as \u201cIron Man molecule\u201d, because the first name of Tetsuo Nozoe can be translated into English as \u201cIron Man\u201d."]}, {"page": "Hinokitiol", "response": ["Hinokitiol was discovered by a Japanese chemist Tetsuo Nozoe in 1936. It was isolated from the essential oil component of the heartwood of Taiwanese hinoki, from which the compound ultimately adopted its name. Hinokitiol is the first non-benzenoid aromatic compound identified. The compound has a heptagonal molecular structure and was first synthesyzed by Ralph Raphael in 1951. Due to its iron-chelating activity, hinokitiol has been called an \"Iron Man molecule\" in the scientific media, which is ironic because Tetsuo is translated into English as \"Iron Man\". Taiwanese hinoki is native to East Asian countries, particularly to Japan and Taiwan. Hinokitiol has also been found in other trees of the Cupressaceae family, including Thuja plicata Donn ex D.
