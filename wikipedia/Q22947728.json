(Which is now The Wallace High School) After leaving secondary education, Martin went up to Queen's University Belfast. Playing his club cricket for Lisburn, as one of \"Awty's Boys\", a group of young cricketers coached by the Staffordshire minor counties cricketer Joe Awty. His move to Belfast saw him play his club cricket for Queen's University. A tall man, standing over six feet tall, Martin used his height to his advantage as a fast-medium bowler, able to extract good bounce and move the ball both ways. His debut for Ireland came in a minor match against Sir J Cahn's XI at Belfast in 1930. His next appearance for Ireland came in July 1934, again in a minor match, this time against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Strabane. Later in August 1934, Martin made his only appearance in first-class cricket for Ireland against the MCC at Dublin. As a bowler, he bowled 18 wicket-less overs in the match, which conceded 49 runs. Batting from the tail, Martin ended Ireland's first-innings unbeaten without scoring, while in their second innings he was dismissed without scoring by Reginald Butterworth. Outside of cricket, Martin was a schoolteacher. However, he was afflicted with tuberculosis and fought a long battle against the illness, succumbing to it in December 1937. His brother, Herbie, was also a first-class cricketer, in addition to playing rugby union."]}]}}
