In Hilary of Poitiers: a Study in Theological Method (1978), Newlands argues for concepts of love as the key to exegesis in theology. In Theology of the Love of God (1980), Newlands takes concepts of the love of God to be the basic structuring element of Christian theology. Newlands engages interpretations of love in the Christian tradition and contemporary uses of concepts of faith, hope, and history, and proposes that the nature of God as love shapes every aspect of theology. In God in Christian Perspective (1994), Newlands's argument is developed further. An understanding of God as a multi-faceted model draws on Christology and Trinity, and faith and practice in community. God is personal, self-differentiated being, transcendent, yet also immanent in the created order as hidden divine presence. The core elements of theology (faith and revelation, divine action and Christology) are reappraised in the light of current theological proposals. Doctrines, Newlands argues, interact in a web of connection to shape Christian practice. A Christian understanding, however, must retain a basic core of unconditional love, Christologically characterised. A contemporary concept of God draws upon these core elements, and upon a retrieval of the historical traditions from which they arise. It can be articulated in language intelligible to contemporary citizens, and its consequences spelled out within the complexity of contemporary cultures. Generosity and the Christian Future (1997) carries this thesis to a further stage through engagement with emancipatory theologies, postmodernity, and political theory. John and Donald Baillie: Transatlantic Theology (2002),  built on first access to the Baillie Papers, lies at the heart of Newlands's constructive proposal. Newlands takes the work of John Baillie and Donald Ballie as seminal to the understanding, justification and revisioning of a progressive Christian theology. This tradition is a trajectory against the stream of contemporary theology. In  The Transformative Imagination: Rethinking Intercultural Theology (2004), Newlands offers a comparative study of connections between theology and culture, through the arts, the sciences, political and human rights issues, and shapes reflection on the mystery of God in a postfoundational frame."]}, {"page": "List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland", "response": ["*1943 John Baillie (Professor of Divinity, University of Edinburgh)"]}, {"page": "Ecclesiastical Household", "response": ["*John Baillie, 3 June 1947 - 1952 (in place of Archibald Main, deceased)", "*John Baillie 1 Aug 1952 - 1960"]}, {"page": "Donald Macpherson Baillie", "response": ["He was the brother of Scottish theologian John Baillie (1889-1960)."]}, {"page": "The Grange, Edinburgh", "response": ["* Very Rev John Baillie, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, 1943/44"]}, {"page": "List of children of clergy", "response": ["* John Baillie, and brother Donald Macpherson Baillie \u2013 prominent Scottish theologians, a third brother Peter Baillie, was a missionary in India.
