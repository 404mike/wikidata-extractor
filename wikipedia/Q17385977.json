Globe described \"an avalanche of prejudicial comment\", and the BBC retrospectively described how he effectively \"ordered media outlets to remove every comment about the trial from any news article and social media post\", remove outbound hyperlinks from their websites, and \"refrain from issuing or forwarding tweets relating to the trial\". It was their opinion that this \"effectively meant [they] had to remove all reports of the trial [...] or disable every hyperlink\" on the BBC website. Citing public interest, these reporting restrictions were challenged by Associated Newspapers, the BBC, Express Newspapers, Sky News, The Guardian, The Independent, The Mirror Group, The Telegraph, and The Times, although the restrictions were upheld. The case was taken to the Court of Appeal before Lord Justice Leveson, Lady Justice Hallett and Lady Justice Sharp. On 11 February 2016, Leveson granted the appeal but with imposed restrictions: the media may report the retrial but without the use of social media or allowing comments on articles; and they may not report on the legal challenge until the verdicts of the trial had been given."]}, {"page": "Recorder of Liverpool", "response": ["* Sir Henry Globe (2003\u20132011)"]}]}}
