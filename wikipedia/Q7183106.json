In 1978, he was invited to join the new avant-garde electronic band The Human League which composed of Oakey, Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh. Then a non-musician, Wright was appointed as 'Director of Visuals' whose job was to provide lighting and slideshows to accompany the Human League's live concerts.\nWhen the Human League split in October 1980, Wright sided with Oakey, while Ware and Marsh left to form Heaven 17. Necessity forced him to become a musician and he quickly learned keyboards. He and Oakey co-wrote some of the new Human League's songs including the number one hit \"Don't You Want Me\", plus tracks such as \"Darkness\", \"I Am the Law\" and \"The Things That Dreams Are Made Of\" for the album Dare. Wright is also credited with the iconic album sleeve design for Dare.\nHe remained a key member of the Human League during the early 1980s both as a composer and keyboard player. He left the band in 1986 after becoming disillusioned with the musical direction Oakey was taking and feeling marginalized by their new producers during the recording of the album Crash in Minneapolis.After The Human League, he worked in film before moving into design.\nIn 1999, he participated in the BBC documentary on The Human League, part of the Young Guns Go For It series.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Human League", "response": ["With their reliance on technology and tape machines, the band had been nervous about playing live. After the Psalter Lane performance, they worried that they had appeared static and uninspiring. A friend of Oakey's who had been in the audience, Philip Adrian Wright, who also had an art and photography background, was invited to become the band's Director of Visuals, with a remit to \"liven up\" the stage performance with slides, film clips and lighting.", "In May 1980, the band toured the UK. Philip Adrian Wright was now playing incidental keyboards in addition to his visuals role. It was the last time all four members performed together live. Also in May, the band released their second studio album Travelogue. More commercial-sounding than Reproduction, it peaked at No.\u00a016 in the UK, giving the band their first real success. As a result, \"Empire State Human\" was re-released and the band made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, even though it only reached No.\u00a062 in the singles chart.", "* Philip Adrian Wright \u2013 visuals (1978\u20131980), keyboards (1980\u20131986)", " bar:Wright text:\"Philip Adrian Wright\""]}, {"page": "Travelogue (The Human League album)", "response": ["*Philip Adrian Wright \u2013 film technician"]}, {"page": "Crash (The Human League album)", "response": ["Keyboard players Philip Adrian Wright and Ian Burden also had been sidelined by Jam and Lewis.

After the acrimonious split of the original band in October 1980 and the subsequent recruitment of Sulley and Catherall, the new band had only just survived a European tour by bringing in session keyboardist Ian Burden to temporarily assist. The band were deeply in debt and only barely commercially viable. Under pressure to produce results from Virgin Records, original members Oakey and Wright returned to Monumental Studios in Sheffield to start recording demo tracks. They recorded the track \"Boys and Girls\" from the 1980 tour, which Virgin then quickly released as a single. The style of \"Boys and Girls\" was more reminiscent of the band's earlier work. Sulley and Catherall, who were busy with school, appeared on the cover of the single but did not perform on the track itself. The synthesiser work was basic as Oakey and Wright admitted they lacked the skill of former members Marsh and Ware.  When \"Boys and Girls\" peaked at number 47 on the UK Singles Chart, Oakey realised that he would need to bring in experienced personnel to take the band in the more pop and commercial sounding direction he wanted.", "The cover art and other album artwork is based on a concept that Oakey wanted, that the album should look like an edition of Vogue. The final design is a joint effort between Philip Adrian Wright (also the band's director of visuals) and graphic designer Ken Ansell. Its typography closely resembles the cover of Vogue's April 1979 issue, which inspired the album's title.

Though the song had been conceived and recorded in the studio as a male solo, Oakey was inspired by the film A Star Is Born and decided to turn the song into a conflicting duet with one of the band's two teenage female vocalists. Susan Ann Sulley was then asked to take on the role. Until then, she and the other female vocalist, Joanne Catherall, had only been assigned backing vocals; Sulley says she was chosen only through \"luck of the draw\".Interview \u2013 Smash Hits Magazine \u2013 December 1981 Musicians Jo Callis and Philip Adrian Wright created a synthesizer score to accompany the lyrics that was much harsher than the version that was actually released.  Initial versions of the song were recorded but Virgin Records-appointed producer Martin Rushent was unhappy with them. He and Callis remixed the track, giving it a softer, and in Oakey's opinion, \"poppy\" sound. Oakey hated the new version and thought it would be the weakest track on Dare, resulting in one of his infamous rows with Rushent.Martin Rushent speaking on UK Channel 4 Documentary \"Top 10 Electro Pioneers\" BBC \u2013 27 November 2001 Oakey disliked it so much that it was relegated to the last track on side two of the album.", "Category:Songs written by Philip Adrian Wright"]}, {"page": "Hysteria (The Human League album)", "response": ["* Philip Adrian Wright \u2013 occasional keyboards"]}, {"page": "Reproduction (album)", "response": ["*Philip Adrian Wright \u2013 film technician"]}, {"page": "Sing, Memory", "response": ["# \"The Black Hit of Space\" (Ian Craig Marsh, Martyn Ware, Philip Adrian Wright, Philip Oakley)"]}, {"page": "The Lebanon (song)", "response": ["The lyrics were an attempt to make a statement on the Lebanese civil war which had been exacerbated by the Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1982.
