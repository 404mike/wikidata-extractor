Butland established himself as first choice keeper at St Andrew's in 2012\u201313 and was transferred to Premier League club Stoke City in January 2013 for a fee of \u00a33.3 million. He was loaned back to Birmingham and went on to play in every league match in 2012\u201313. Butland then spent time out on loan at Barnsley before making his Premier League debut in January 2014. He had loan spells with Leeds United and Derby County in 2014 before he became Stoke's number one in 2015\u201316. Butland spent seven seasons at Stoke, winning their player of the year award twice. He joined Crystal Palace in October 2020. \nAt international level, he represented England at all age-group levels, playing for the under-17 team that won the 2010 European championships and for the under-20s at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Following the departure of manager Tony Pulis, S\u00f8rensen planned to talk with new manager Mark Hughes about his future at the Britannia Stadium. S\u00f8rensen played his first Premier League game for over 20 months on 26 December 2013 at Newcastle United after Begovi\u0107 suffered an injury. However, despite him saving a penalty from Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, Stoke had two men sent-off and went on to lose 5\u20131. S\u00f8rensen started the next two matches before he himself was injured against Everton enabling third-choice Butland to fill in for Begovi\u0107. Once Begovi\u0107 returned from his injury Butland was loaned out to Leeds United, leaving S\u00f8rensen to resume his place as back-up for the remainder of the 2013\u201314 season and was offered a one-year contract extension, which he signed in May 2014.

S\u00f8rensen received a special recognition award at the end of the season for his contribution to Stoke, in total he spent seven seasons at the Britannia Stadium making 129 appearances.

The club endured a tough final week of January as they lost 3\u20130 to both Leicester and Manchester United and were knocked out of the League Cup by Liverpool after losing on penalties, and were also ousted from the FA Cup by Crystal Palace. In the January transfer window, Hughes let Steve Sidwell leave as well as cutting short Marco van Ginkel's loan, while he broke the club's transfer record he had set in the summer after signing French midfielder Giannelli Imbula from Porto for a fee of \u00a318.3\u00a0million. Stoke's form improved in February and March as they defeated Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Watford and earned a first Premier League draw at Chelsea. Following a season-ending injury to goalkeeper Jack Butland while on international duty, however, Stoke lost their defensive organisation: They let a 2\u20130 lead slip against Swansea to draw 2\u20132 and then went and conceded four goals in three successive matches, against Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City. Hughes' team were able to end the season on a positive as they beat West Ham 2\u20131 on the final day of the season, enough to secure a third-straight ninth-place finish."]}, {"page": "Lee Clark (footballer)", "response": ["Clark endured a difficult start to his managerial reign, with a draw and two losses in a row for his first three games in the Championship. His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5\u20130 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March. Despite receiving criticism from fans for alleged poor management skills regarding public fallouts with Nikola Zigic, Clark has been praised for introducing academy players into the first team squad, players including Jack Butland, Will Packwood, Mitch Hancox, Callum Reilly, Koby Arthur and Reece Hales. Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4\u20130 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1\u20130 wins against Bristol City and Leeds. After finishing the season in 12th place, 7 points off the play-offs, Clark made his first signings for the 2013\u201314 Championship season with Darren Randolph, Andrew Shinnie and Lee Novak all signing on free transfers, whilst Olly Lee's loan was made permanent. The 2013\u201314 season started poorly again for Clark, with Birmingham winning a single game in the league against Yeovil Town as the Blues made their worst start to a league season for 25 years. Despite poor results in the league (including an 18 home match run without a league win) and the removal from the coaching staff of Clark's right hand men Derek Fazackerley and Terry McDermott, Clark managed to keep Birmingham City in the Championship with an injury time equaliser from Paul Caddis in the final game of the 2013\u201314 season against Bolton, the 2\u20132 result being enough to keep the team up on goal difference."]}, {"page": "Tony Pulis", "response": ["Stoke, however, made a poor start to 2013 picking up just a point in January and a frustrating transfer window saw just two new arrivals American winger Brek Shea and England goalkeeper Jack Butland.

Victories against Queens Park Rangers and Norwich City saw Stoke avoid the threat of relegation and they finished the 2012\u201313 Premier League season in 13th position. It was a season of little progress at Stoke, and Pulis left the club on 21 May 2013 after a meeting with club chairman Peter Coates.

On 25 April, Kenny's agents brought out a statement confirming that Kenny was fit and available for selection despite his absence from the matchday squads. On 30 June 2014, Kenny was left out of Leeds' two week pre-season training camp to Santa Cristina in Italy. On 3 July, the Professional Footballers' Association investigated alleged media reports that Kenny had been dropped due to his birthdate falling on the 17th of a month, with owner Massimo Cellino having a deep superstition of the number 17. However, Kenny's agent Paul Masterton, laughed off the claims that Kenny had been dropped due to his birthdate falling on the 17th of a month.

Ruddy was called up for the friendly against Italy in Bern, Switzerland, on 10 August 2012, along with Butland and Joe Hart.

In the FA Cup, Doyle saved two penalties from Juan Mata in the FA Cup; one in the initial fifth-round match, which finished 1\u20131, and one in the replay, which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat. His performance in the initial match against Chelsea resulted in him being named as the man of the match.
