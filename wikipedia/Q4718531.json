In his personal library were two editions of Scapula's 1579 abridgement of Henricus Stephanus' Thesaurus Graecae Linguae, which listed \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\" as the name for \"diagnostics,\"\"Semiotics.\" Oxford English Dictionary (1989). [\"The branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of symptoms.\"] the branch of medicine concerned with interpreting symptoms of disease (\"symptomatology\"). Indeed, physician and scholar Henry Stubbe (1670) had transliterated this term of specialized science into English precisely as \"semeiotics,\" marking the first use of the term in English:Stubbes, Henry. 1670. The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus. London. p. 75.\"\u2026nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal phisiology (founded on observation, not principles), semeiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines.\u2026\"Locke would use the term sem(e)iotike in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (book IV, chap. 21),Encyclopedia Britannica. 2020 [1998]. \"Semiotics: Study of Signs.\" Encyclopedia Britannica.

He notably writes both (a) \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\" and (b) \"\u03a3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\": when term (a) is followed by any kind of punctuation mark, it takes the form (b).  In Chapter XX, titled \"Division of the Sciences,\" which concludes the 1st edition of Locke's Essay (1689/1690), Locke introduces \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\"  in \u00a74 as his proposed name synonymous with \"the Doctrine of Signs\" for the development of the future study of the ubiquitous role of signs within human awareness. In the 4th edition of Locke's Essay (1700), a new Chapter XIX, titled \"Of Enthusiasm,\" is inserted into Book IV. As result, Chapter XX of the 1st edition becomes Chapter XXI for all subsequent editions. It is an important fact that Locke's proposal for the development of semiotics, with three passing exceptions as \"asides\" in the writings of Berkeley, Leibniz, and Condillac, \"is met with a resounding silence that lasts as long as modernity itself. Even Locke's devoted late modern editor, Alexander Campbell Fraser, dismisses out of hand 'this crude and superficial scheme of Locke'\" Deely adds \"Locke's modest proposal subversive of the way of ideas, its reception, and its bearing on the resolution of an ancient and a modern controversy in logic.\" In the Oxford University Press critical edition (1975), prepared and introduced by Peter Harold Nidditch, Nidditch tells us, in his \"Foreword,\" that he presents us with \"a complete, critically established, and unmodernized text that aims at being historically faithful to Locke's final intentions\"; that \"the present text is based on the original fourth edition of the Essay; and that \"readings in the other early authorized editions are adopted, in appropriate form, where necessary, and recorded otherwise in the textual notes.\" The term \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\" appears in that 4th edition (1700), the last published (but not the last prepared) within Locke's lifetime, with exactly the spelling and final accent found in the 1st edition. Yet if we turn to (the final) chapter XXI of the Oxford edition (1975, p. 720), we find not \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\" but rather do we find substituted the \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\" spelling (and with final accent reversed).
