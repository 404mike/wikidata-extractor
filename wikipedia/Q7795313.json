Worsnop was born in Wortley, Yorkshire, England and died in North Adelaide, South Australia.Thomas Worsnop died on 24 January 1898 at his home in Barnard Street, North Adelaide.\nWorsnop arrived in South Australia on 12 November 1852. He first settled at Port Elliot with his family and worked as a storeman, for seven years, for Elder, Stirling and Company. In 1859 he was appointed a sergeant in the South Australian Volunteers. For a time he worked on the land but not with great success. Then he tried work as a publican and in 1863 he was lessee of the Globe Inn in Rundle Street, but he was declared bankrupt in 1864. Next, Worsnop took up the drudgery of work as a teamster in the north. Finally, in September 1866 he became a clerk in the Town Clerk's department in Adelaide and on 11 January 1869 was appointed acting town clerk taking over permanently later that year.\nSomewhat surprisingly, given his previous failures, Worsnop proved to be a good administrator and he was able to reduce the debt of the City Council. He was also most concerned with protecting the parklands and fascinated by the history of city and colony. In 1878 he wrote the detailed History of the City of Adelaide and later had published several papers on Aboriginal artefacts and weapons.\nHe is commemorated with the naming in his honour of Mount Worsnop in the Gibson Desert of Western Australia by Sir John Forrest on 15 July 1874.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Australian megafauna", "response": ["The association was made at least as early as 1845, with colonists writing that Aboriginal people identified Diprotodon bones as belonging to bunyips, and Thomas Worsnop concluding that the fear of bunyip attacks at watering holes remembered a time when Diprotodon lived in marshes."]}, {"page": "North Road Cemetery", "response": ["* Thomas Worsnop, City Treasurer and Town Clerk of the City of Adelaide, historian, fellow of the Royal Historical Society, London."]}, {"page": "Baijini", "response": ["Fitzgerald's allusion was a figurine which had been dug up 4\u00a0feet down among the roots of a banyan tree by Chinese natives, under the direction of a Public Works superintendent, Mr. Strawbridge, who was overseeing the clearance of dense jungle for the construction of a road at a site called Doctor's Gully in Palmerston just outside of the town of Darwin in 1879. The gully leads down to a sandy cove, and is one of the two sites where fresh water can be found in Darwin. The figurine was mounted on an animal, identified as either a gazelle or antelope. It came into the possession of Thomas Worsnop who reproduced a drawing of it in his 1897 work on Aboriginal arts and manufactures. Worsnop described it as fashioned from a type of jade, though later scholars have stated it is made of soapstone, and stated that all inquiries he had made to determine what it represented had failed to clarify its origin. Eventually, In a paper read before the Royal Society of South Australia on 8 March 1928, Norman Tindale identified it as a Chinese deity from the Tang dynasty, a high backdating which elicited Fitzgerald's skepticism. The deity in question, associated with Canopus, is the Old Man of the South Pole,Sh\u00f2u l\u01ceo,(\u58fd\u8001), the Chinese god of longevity who was one of the S\u0101nx\u012bng, or three stellar deities in Chinese religion."]}, {"page": "Royal Geographical Society of Australasia", "response": ["* Thomas Worsnop"]}, {"page": "W. A. Hughes", "response": ["At the end of 1868 the Council declared all positions vacant. Hughes did not apply for his old job, and the newly appointed City Treasurer Thomas Worsnop was deputised to take on his duties pro tem. Worsnop acted as Town Clerk from 11 January to 27 July 1869, when the appointment was formalised This voluntary resignation came as a surprise to many, but then the truth came to light, largely due to the conscientiousness of mayor Fuller, that Hughes had been in 1866 and 1867 embezzling Council funds by clever manipulation of the cheque account, which could only be detected by careful comparison of the amount withdrawn and that written on the chequebook stubs. The truth came to light through Hughes's method of repaying the defalcations; by destroying cheques and paying creditors cash out of his own pocket. Hughes was tried, convicted and sentenced to eight years' jail with hard labour."]}, {"page": "Worsnop", "response": ["*Thomas Worsnop (1821\u20131898), Australian soldier, historian and government official"]}]}}
