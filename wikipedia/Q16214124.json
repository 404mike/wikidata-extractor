After the deposition of the last Sultan, Mehmed VI, in 1922, and the subsequent abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924, members of the Imperial family were forced into exile. Their descendants now live in many different countries throughout Europe, as well as in the United States, the Middle East, and since they have now been permitted to return to their homeland, many now also live in Turkey. When in exile, the family adopted the surname of Osmano\u011flu, meaning \"son of Osman\", after the founder of the House of Osman and direct ancestor of all current family members.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
