After a month's journey through wastes so harsh that even some of the camels died, on 2 February 1932 Philby arrived at a patch of ground about a half a square kilometre in size, littered with chunks of white sandstone, black glass, and chunks of iron meteorite. Philby identified two large circular depressions partially filled with sand, and three other features that he identified as possible \"submerged craters\".  He also mapped the area where the large iron block was reputed to have been found.  Philby thought that the area was a volcano, and it was only after bringing back samples to the UK that the site was identified as that of a meteorite impact by Leonard James Spencer of the British Museum.Philby (1933), pp 1-26"]}, {"page": "List of mineralogists", "response": ["*Leonard James Spencer (1870\u20131959)"]}, {"page": "Roebling Medal", "response": ["*1940 \u2013 Leonard James Spencer"]}, {"page": "Beckfoot Oakbank", "response": ["* Leonard James Spencer CBE, geologist and President 1936\u201339 of the Mineralogical Society"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Spencer", "response": ["* Leonard James Spencer (1870\u20131959), British geologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|Leonard James Spencer||07/05/1925||7 July 1870 \u2013 14 April 1959"]}, {"page": "Keeper of Mineralogy, Natural History Museum", "response": ["*Leonard James Spencer (1927\u20131935)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1925", "response": ["*Leonard James Spencer"]}, {"page": "Penelope Spencer", "response": ["Born in the London district of Battersea, she was the daughter of geologist Leonard James Spencer and of Edith Mary Close, a schoolteacher.
