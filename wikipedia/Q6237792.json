In the final, played at Kennington Oval on 25 March 1882, the Old Boys met Blackburn Rovers, who were the first team from outside London and the Home counties to appear in an FA Cup Final. Blackburn included England internationals, Fred Hargreaves, John Hargreaves and Jimmy Brown as well as Fergus Suter, who had been signed from Darwen. The Old Boys dominated the early stages of the match but Rovers defended well until, according to the match report in Gibbons' \"Association Football in Victorian England\", \"following an expert through ball by Dunn, Macaulay steered the ball between the Blackburn goalposts to secure a well-deserved half-time lead\". The Old Etonians were able to prevent Blackburn from scoring in the second half, thus claiming the cup for the second time in three years."]}]}}
