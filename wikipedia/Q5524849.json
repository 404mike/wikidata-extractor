Other former members of the band have played in Simple Minds, Deacon Blue and Swiss Family Orbison.", "Gary Clark and Ged Grimes grew up together in Dundee, Scotland and played together in school bands. Influenced by soul and pop artists such as Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder and Bacharach and David, they eventually moved to London, where they played in the bands Perfect Strangers and Dream Kitchen during the early 1980s. Neither band met with success: circa 1984, while still in London, Clark and Grimes noticed that talent scouts and journalists were beginning to follow the soul and pop scenes in Scottish cities. Returning to Dundee, they teamed up with Gary Clark's younger brother Kit Clark to form a new band called Spencer Tracy (after the film star of the same name).", "Initially spotted by music journalist Bob Flynn, during a very sparsely attended gig in Edinburgh and after a glowing review piece by Flynn in Melody Maker which attracted much attention from record labels, Spencer Tracy signed to Virgin Records in 1986. After objections from the estate of the actor Spencer Tracy, the band was obliged to change its name. Gary Clark recalls this as \"a real last-minute crazy, fearful moment... The album was done, the artwork was done... We were just told, 'If you try and use this, you will be sued.' And so the label just went 'Nope. Change it. Now.'\" For their new name, the band chose Danny Wilson, taken from a 1952 Frank Sinatra film called Meet Danny Wilson (itself a favourite film of the Clark brothers' father).", "The band's debut album Meet Danny Wilson, written entirely by Gary Clark, was released in 1987. An acclaimed mix of sophisti-pop with elements of soul, jazz and bossa nova, it included an appearance by Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy among others.", "The band released its second album, Bebop Moptop the following year. Gary Clark was no longer the band's only songwriter, as Ged Grimes and Kit Clark co-wrote \"I Can't Wait\" and Kit also contributed \"N.Y.C Shanty\", both of which Kit sang on the record. The first single released from the album was \"Never Gonna Be the Same\", but this was overshadowed by its successor, the hit single \"The Second Summer of Love\", which reached number 23 in the British charts. As initially written it was barely more than a minute long, so when Virgin Records picked the song for single release the band extended it via a long harmonica solo.", "Three more singles were released from Bebop Moptop \u2013 \"If Everything You Said Was True\", the slow ballad \"If You Really Love Me (Let Me Go)\", and \"I Can't Wait\", but in spite of Virgin Records' promotional efforts, none of them were hits. Gary Clark has subsequently suggested that this was simply down to airplay problems: \"Virgin were really great at that time, and, y'know, we didn't really fit what was on the radio at any time. We kind of got lucky with \"Mary's Prayer\", in the sense that it just happened to fit, whereas the records were pretty eclectic. And Virgin, even though they loved the band and loved the stuff, they obviously had trouble at radio. It didn't fit with what was going on.\"", "By the time the band began to demo the third Danny Wilson album in 1991, all three members had written more songs than would fit onto the album, leading to arguments and frustration. Kit Clark attempted to solve the situation by persuading Virgin Records to let him record a solo album, but was rebuffed; following this, he decided to leave the band. Deciding that Danny Wilson would be too much reduced without Kit's contribution (\"he was kind of a really good force just in terms of ideas and the flavour of things\"), Gary Clark opted to break up the band, maintaining its creative integrity and the friendships between all members before both were spoiled.", "Following the relative commercial failure of Ten Short Songs About Love, Gary Clark abandoned solo work to form first the rock band King L (with American bass player Eric Pressly and former Bible guitarist Neill Maccoll) and then the pop band Transister (with Pressly and lead singer Keeley Hawkes). Clark then stepped down from performing to turn his attention to writing and producing for other artists. In 2001, he worked on Natalie Imbruglia's second album, White Lilies Island, and co-wrote most of the album's songs with her, including the single \"Wrong Impression\".
