Charles Richard Fairey was seconded there for a short time, before setting up his own company, Fairey Aviation, which relocated in 1918 to a large new factory across the railway in North Hyde Road. Over 4,500 aircraft were subsequently produced here, but Fairey needed an airfield to test these aircraft and in 1928 secured a site in nearby Heathrow. This became the Great West Aerodrome, which was requisitioned by the Air Ministry in 1944. It was initially developed as a heavy-bomber base intended for Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, but when the Second World War ended in 1945, it was taken over by the Ministry of Aviation and became Heathrow Airport."]}, {"page": "List of aerospace engineers", "response": ["* Charles Richard Fairey (1857\u20131956) \u2013 founder of the Fairey Aviation Company"]}, {"page": "Iver", "response": ["* Charles Richard Fairey Founder of Fairey aviation, the Fairey factory based in West London creators of the Swordfish.

On seeing the Curtiss CR, powered by a Curtiss D-12 V-12 liquid-cooled engine of low frontal area and in a low drag installation, win the 1923 Schneider Trophy race, Fairey realised that this engine would be well suited to a new bomber and acquired an example of the engine and a licence for production.Mason 1994, p.167.Jarrett 1993, pp. 27\u201328."]}, {"page": "Fairey Marine", "response": ["Fairey Marine Ltd, latterly known as FBM Marine, was a boat building company based on the River Hamble, Southampton, England.
