In the 1850s and 1860s, he was engineer for the world's first underground railway, London's Metropolitan Railway, built by the \"cut-and-cover\" method under city streets. In the 1880s, he was chief engineer for the Forth Bridge, which opened in 1890. Fowler's was a long and eminent career, spanning most of the 19th century's railway expansion, and he was engineer, adviser or consultant to many British and foreign railway companies and governments. He was the youngest president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, between 1865 and 1867, and his major works represent a lasting legacy of Victorian engineering.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 15", "response": ["*1817 \u2013 Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet, English engineer, designed the Forth Bridge (d. 1898)"]}, {"page": "November 20", "response": ["*1898 \u2013 Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet, English engineer (b. 1817)"]}, {"page": "East Midlands", "response": ["Torksey railway viaduct, built across the Trent in 1849, is considered to be the first box girder bridge, designed by Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet.
