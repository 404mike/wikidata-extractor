After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man's operation, arrive and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car, but Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, he first recounts how he and Adelaide found their house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with it and its surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man.

I couldn't even think about technique, I just had to keep looking at the [novel] and then somehow radiate the feelings\". Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see \"what a difference [her character's] sense of unhappiness can create\", as by the end of the film Anne is \"happier and looks better\". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen \"understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes\". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a \"competent leader of men in his profession\", he was \"socially inept\" in Anne's presence.
