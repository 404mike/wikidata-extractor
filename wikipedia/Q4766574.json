The individual competition was held over two rounds. The course of the first round consisted of 14 obstacles and 17 jumping efforts over a 760-meter track, with several difficult individual fences. This included a 5-meter water, which produced 33 faults in the first round, and several massive oxers (four at 2 meters wide and a fifth at 2.10 meters) which all combined produced another 20 faults. Only 3 riders were able to produce a clear round, and 8 finished with only a knockdown. The second round was a 660-meter track with 10 obstacles and 13 jumping efforts. One rider who went clear in the first round was not in contention after the second. The two other clear rounds from the first course\u2014Graziano Mancinelli and Ann Moore\u2014had 2 rails apiece in the second for 8 faults. Neal Shapiro, one of the eight 4-faulters in round 1, finished the second round with only one rail so also finished both rounds with 8 faults. Therefore, a jump-off between the 3 riders decided who was to take home gold, silver, and bronze. Mancinelli managed a clear for the gold, followed by Moore who had three faults for silver, and then Shapiro who had two knock downs.Equestrianism at the 1972 M\u00fcnchen Summer Games: Mixed Jumping, Individual. sports-reference.com"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Moore", "response": ["*Ann Moore (equestrian) (born 1950), 1972 Olympic silver medalist in show jumping", "*Ann Moore (impostor) (1761\u20131813), notorious as the fasting-woman of Tutbury", "*Ann Moore (inventor) (born 1940), inventor of the Snugli"]}, {"page": "Ann Moore", "response": ["* Ann Moore (equestrian) (born 1950), 1972 Olympic silver medalist in show jumping", "* Ann Moore (impostor) (1761\u20131813), notorious as the fasting-woman of Tutbury", "* Ann Moore (inventor) (born 1934), inventor of the Snugli"]}, {"page": "Equestrian at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual jumping", "response": ["The individual show jumping in equestrian at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich was held at Olympic Stadium on 3 September.
