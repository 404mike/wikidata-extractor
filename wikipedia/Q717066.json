If two drums are used, that is often to give a more impressive appearance on large stages, but sometimes, the second drum is being pitched differently to provide some variety in the notes, thus creating a more nuanced sound. The first person to use and popularize the double bass drum setup was jazz drummer Louie Bellson,Mattingly, Rick (2006). All About Drums: A Fun and Simple Guide to Playing Drums, unpaginated. Hal Leonard. . who came up with the idea when he was still in high school. Double bass drums were popularized in the 1960s by rock drummers Ginger Baker of Cream, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Keith Moon of The Who and Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. After 1970, Billy Cobham and Narada Michael Walden used double kick drum with the jazz fusion project Mahavishnu Orchestra, Chester Thompson with Frank Zappa and Weather Report, Barriemore Barlow with Jethro Tull, and Terry Bozzio with Frank Zappa. For these genres the focus was 'odd-meter grooves and mind blowing solos'.Nyman, John (2009). \"Double Bass Legends: A Short History \", DrumMagazine.com. Retrieved 29.01.2012 Double bass drumming later became an integral part of heavy metal, as pioneered by the likes of Les Binks, Carmine Appice, Ian Paice, Cozy Powell, Phil Taylor and Tommy Aldridge. American thrash metal band Slayer's former drummer Dave Lombardo was named \"the godfather of double bass\" by the magazine Drummerworld. Later metal genres including death metal use double kick drumming extensively often with blast beat techniques, whilst focusing on precision, 'endurance', 'speed' and 'rapid footwork'."]}, {"page": "2015", "response": ["* November 11 \u2013 Phil Taylor, English rock drummer (b. 1954)"]}, {"page": "Thrash metal", "response": ["Among the earliest songs credited with influencing future thrash musicians was Queen's \"Stone Cold Crazy\", recorded and released in 1974. The song was described as being thrash metal \"before the term had been invented\". Black Sabbath's \"Symptom of the Universe\", released in 1975, is often referred to as a compelling early influence on thrash, and was a direct inspiration for Diamond Head's pioneering song \"Am I Evil?\". The NWOBHM bands emerging from Britain in the late 1970s further influenced the development of early thrash. The early work of artists such as Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Mot\u00f6rhead, Tygers of Pan Tang, Raven, and Angel Witch, among others, introduced the fast-pace and intricate musicianship that became core aspects of thrash. Phil Taylor's double-bass drumming featured in Mot\u00f6rhead's 1979 song \"Overkill\" has been acknowledged by many thrash drummers, most notably Lars Ulrich, as a primary influence on their playing. Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel played a key role in bringing the emerging genre to a larger audience, as he was responsible for discovering both Metallica and Slayer and producing their earliest studio recordings."]}, {"page": "1954 in music", "response": ["*September 21 \u2013 Phil Taylor, English heavy metal drummer (Mot\u00f6rhead) (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "Avedis Zildjian Company", "response": ["* Phil Taylor of Motorhead"]}, {"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Phil Taylor (Mot\u00f6rhead)"]}, {"page": "Ace of Spades (album)", "response": ["On 28 March 2005, the documentary about the album (a part of the Classic Albums series) was released on DVD by Eagle Vision.
