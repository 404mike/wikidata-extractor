After recovering from a near-fatal car accident \u2013 which took place on 20 January 1927, on the way to the HMV studios at Hayes, Middlesex \u2013 he made the first in a string of \"continental tours\" that lasted until 1930. The orchestra's line-up also included some of the most skilled musicians of the time. \"Regular\" players included saxophonists Billy Ternent (who was also the band's main arranger and co-leader), Edward Owen (E.O.) \"Poggy\" Pogson and Noel \"Chappie\" d'Amato, trumpeter/cornetist Jack Jackson, trombonist Lew Davis, violinists Hugo Rignold and Harry Berly, pianist/arranger Peter Yorke, and (from 1928) singer Sam Browne. The orchestra was often augmented with members of other Hylton-controlled bands, especially for 12-inch \"concert arrangements\".

Lynn married Harry Lewis, a clarinettist in the band, in 1939. Other singers with the Ambrose band included Sam Browne, Elsie Carlisle, Denny Dennis, who recorded a number of duets with Vera Lynn, Max Bacon (also the band's drummer), Evelyn Dall and Anne Shelton, with whom \"When That Man is Dead and Gone\", a jibe at Adolf Hitler, written by Irving Berlin, was recorded in 1941.

On her earliest sessions, she was accompanied by Carroll Gibbons on piano, and began recording vocals for dance bands in 1929; she sang with several of the biggest dance bands of the era, including the famous Ambrose orchestra. Carlisle was also backed by Ambrose when she performed solo, and made duets with Sam Browne, being hailed as one of the band's best singers. Her performance of \"Home, James, and Don't Spare the Horses\" with the orchestra might have helped to popularise this phrase. Her other most well-known song may be \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\". However, her greatest claim to fame is that Cole Porter personally requested her to introduce his composition \"What is This Thing Called Love?\", which became a jazz standard.

Some of the arrangements on Durium were by Stan Bowsher. In October 1932, when Roy Fox's contract at the Monseigneur ended, Stone was offered the post of bandleader and this story filled the pages of the music press. An article from Rhythm magazine describes how this happened. The Tuesday night broadcasts from the Monseigneur established Stone's band as a favourite with the listening public, who recognised the sheer quality of the music, and the royal clientele attracted an unsurpassed reputation. Rave reviews were common in the music press, for example Melody Maker. The popularity of vocalist Al Bowlly increased; he was a regular on broadcasts, his name was credited on many of the Decca records and he toured with the band including an appearance before of royalty at the London Palladium.", "In November 1933, Stone transferred his band to the Cafe Anglais and in February 1934 started a successful tour for the Mecca Agency. The band returned to the Monseigneur in March 1934 until the summer when the Monseigneur was sold to become a cinema. In September 1934, Al Bowlly and Bill Harty left to join Ray Noble in U.S. For about a year from November 1934, Stone moved to the Regal Zonophone record label, continued with theatre tours, and the band was resident for a time at the Hollywood Restaurant. Alan Kane became the main vocalist while there were also vocal contributions from band members Nat Gonella, Joe Ferrie, Tiny Winters, Joe Crossman, and American composer Al Hoffman. When Gonella left to concentrate on his own Georgians band in March 1935, trumpeter Tommy McQuater joined Stone's band. On 12 October, Stone featured Sam Browne as vocalist for the first time with \"Cheek To Cheek\" and \"Isn't This A Lovely Day?\". In November, Stone and his band returned to the Decca record label. In 1936, Stone stopped touring and formed a smaller band which opened on 30 March at the Cafe de Paris. The band also began to broadcast regularly for commercial radio stations Radio Normandy and Radio Luxembourg. In October, Stone became musical director for the show On Your Toes (opened February 1937). The band continued at the Cafe de Paris until 31 July 1937. In September, Stone became musical director of the show Hide and Seek at the London Hippodrome, starring Cicely Courtneidge and Bobby Howes."]}, {"page": "British dance band", "response": ["* Sam Browne"]}, {"page": "Broken Wings (1953 song)", "response": ["Valentine's version was, in fact, the first to be released in the UK by some months, in July 1952.
