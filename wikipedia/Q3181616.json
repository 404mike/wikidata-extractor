Written by Terry Nation and directed by John Gorrie, the serial takes on a \"mini-adventures\" format, in which the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell), and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) search for four keys to restore the Conscience of Marinus, a computer which maintains law and order. The group travel to two cities, a jungle, and an icy wasteland in search of the keys.", "The Keys of Marinus was written to replace a different script, Dr Who and the Hidden Planet by Malcolm Hulke, which was deemed problematic and required rewrites. The production team approached Terry Nation, writer of the second serial The Daleks, to write the serial. Nation had been due to write Doctor Whos eighth serial, The Red Fort, but had focused on other projects in the interim. Due to the quick turnaround required for the script, Nation and script editor David Whitaker decided to base the serial around a series of \"mini-adventures\", each with a different setting and cast; Nation was intrigued by the idea of the TARDIS crew searching for parts of a puzzle. As the first two episodes were written with mostly interior sets, Nation wanted to tell a story more \"out in the open\", setting the third episode in a jungle to allow the designer an opportunity for different settings. Whitaker suggested a cold snow-scape setting for the fourth episode to contrast with the hot jungle. Nation used many existing words for location and character names in the story: Marinus originated from the Latin word marinus, meaning \"of the sea\"; Morphoton is based on Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams; Millennius came from the term millennium, for a thousand years; and Arbitan is based on the Latin word Arbiter, meaning a judge. Producer Verity Lambert selected John Gorrie as the serial's director; even though Gorrie was unhappy with the quality of the scripts, he agreed to direct the serial to advance his career."]}, {"page": "David Dixon", "response": ["Dixon's most notable role was in the 1981 BBC TV series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in which he starred as Ford Prefect.
