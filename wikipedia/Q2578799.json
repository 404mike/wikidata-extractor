On 12 Oct. 1787, Musgrave was appointed colonel of the new 76th Regiment of Foot or 'Hindustan' regiment, which was raised for service in India, by the East India Company. The rendezvous was at Chatham, and the recruits were chiefly from the Musgrave family estates in the north of England. Musgrave went out to India with it, and served on the staff at Madras for several years. He became a major-general, 28 April 1790. His hopes of a command against Tipu Sultan were disappointed by Lord Cornwallis, who appears to have thought that Musgrave did not work harmoniously with the civil government of Madras. Musgrave's plan of operations is published in 'Cornwallis's Correspondence.Cokayne page 436 On his return Musgrave received many marks of attention from royalty. He was appointed governor of Chelsea Hospital, but exchanged with William Fawcett for that of Governor of Gravesend and Tilbury, which did not require residence.
