He did not pretend to know how to run a record label and evidently did not trust Cassini\u2019s business acumen either, so by March 1958 he was employing Barrington-Coupe as his executive producer. At this time, orchestral recording in Britain was subject to strict union rules that made it prohibitively expensive for independent labels. In Hamburg, they found a custom recording service who provided session players drawn from local ensembles. Saga sent the pianists Sergio Fiorentino and Barrington-Coupe's newly-wed wife, Joyce Hatto, and sent its own engineer, James Lock, to the sessions. They also recorded in Copenhagen with  pianist Eileen Joyce (1908-91) and the violinist Alan Loveday. Cassini persuaded Lazar Berman to make an LP while on a concert visit to London. Some Russian tapes were procured, so the public was offered quite a substantial selection of LPs, EPs and tapes when the first catalogue was published in September 1958. in 1959 a licensing deal for distribution in the USA was struck with Roulette, which had no classical titles of its own and created the Forum label specially for its acquisitions.
