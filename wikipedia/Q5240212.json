Ellerman Lines made a significant investment in the ground, transforming it into their social club. The original cricket club moved to a different ground, but the cricket oval itself was retained. Cheshire first played minor counties cricket at the ground in the 1957 Minor Counties Championship against Northumberland. With the exception of 1958, Cheshire played one Minor Counties Championship match annually there, with their final match in 1968 coming against the Yorkshire Second XI. A single List A match was played there in the first round of the 1964 Gillette Cup between Cheshire and Surrey, in what was Cheshire's first appearance in List A cricket. Surrey won the toss and elected to bat first, making 171/8 in their innings, with John Edrich top-scoring with 70, while Norman Halsall was the most effective Cheshire bowler with figures of 2/37 from thirteen overs. Cheshire were dismissed for 109 in their chase, with Roy Collins top-scoring with 58. David Sydenham took figures of 4/6 from nine overs, including 4 wickets in 5 balls, which included a hat-trick.
