One of those, certainly known to Allen, was the Unitarian William Pitt Scargill, associated also with Richard Phillips of The Monthly Magazine. In 1816, Allen became a founding member of the Peace Society, at another meeting in his home.

The Clays, who had been users of Cheltenham's natural waters, rented a cottage in Hockley and dug a water well in its garden. Letitia, a chronic asthmatic, found relief in drinking the water and declared it to be medicinal; they renamed their cottage Hockley Spa Lodge. In order to capitalise on their discovery, and to emulate the kind of success that spas in Bath and Royal Tunbridge Wells had achieved, they sought advice from a local businessman, William Summersall, who later became the manager of the spa, on how to build a pumping room to access larger amounts of water for the wider public.Hembry, pp. 95\u201396. The Clay's claimed that the water could heal asthma, indigestion, and infections of the liver, kidneys and bladder. On Summersall's advice, they invited Dr. A. B Granville, an author who become notable for his many books on the medicinal properties of the world's natural spas, to test the water.\"Hockley Spa Pump Room open\", The Bury and Norwich Post, 14 Jun 1843, p. 2. Granville was impressed and sent the samples to Sir Richard Phillips, a leading authority on natural consumables.
