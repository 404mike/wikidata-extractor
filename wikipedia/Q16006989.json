He was a right-arm medium-pace off-break bowler who batted in the lower order and played over 300 first-class matches in his career. After his cricketing career he coached cricket and was a scorer. His son, Colin Fairservice, played for Kent and Middlesex from 1929 to 1936.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Blythe", "response": ["A drier summer in 1904 resulted in fewer pitches which favoured Blythe's bowling, and his 138 wickets came at the higher average of 19.60. He showed again that he could perform on harder pitches and slow the run-scoring of batsmen when necessary, bowling for an hour against Sussex at Tunbridge Wells in a high-scoring match without conceding a run.Scoble, p. 56. His wickets generally came steadily, although against Hampshire he took thirteen wickets for 91 in JuneScoble, p. 57. and then fifteen for 76 in a single day's play on a wet pitch at Canterbury in August, including nine for 30 in the first innings.Scoble, pp. 58\u201359. He also began to show more potential as a batsman: against Nottinghamshire, he scored 82 not out, sharing a partnership of 106 for the ninth wicket with Bill Fairservice; batting at number four against Yorkshire he scored 42 not out; and against Somerset he scored 70 in an hour out of a last-wicket partnership of 98 with Fairservice. In total, he scored 400 first-class runs, improving by nearly 150 runs on his previous best, and his batting average reached 15.38, the only time he averaged more than 15 in an English season.Scoble, pp. 57\u201358. More than one critic claimed that Blythe could have become a good batsman had he so wished, but he never batted as consistently again, and preferred hard-hitting in the lower order to serious batting. At the end of the season he was the subject of one of the prestigious front-page profiles in Cricket magazine,Scoble, p. 58.Bettesworth WA (1904) A chat about C. Blythe, Cricket, no. 673, vol. XXIII, pp. 369\u2013370. (Available online at The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians.

(The Times Digital Archive, . Retrieved 26 August 2021.)", "In the 1907 County Championship match at the County Cricket Ground, Northampton, Kent defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 155 runs. Kent had batted first, having won the toss, and had then dismissed Northants for 60 and 39. The story of the match is that it was dominated by, first, the weather and then by Blythe. The first day was Thursday, 28 May, Blythe's 28th birthday. Play could not commence until mid-afternoon and then three hours were possible before more rain intervened. Kent won the toss, batted first and reached 212 for 4. On the Friday, no play was possible because of persistent rain. The weather relented on Saturday morning and Kent were able to continue their innings. Their tactics were simply to score as many as possible as quickly as possible and they added 42 in forty minutes to reach an all out 254 with more than an hour to go before lunch. On a wet but drying wicket, Blythe was in his element. He opened the bowling from the pavilion end and, in sixteen overs, shattered Northants with a career-best return of 10 for 30. Northants had to follow-on but, with Blythe taking seven for 18, their second innings lasted only thirty overs, so Blythe had taken 17 wickets in a single day's play.Scoble, pp. 81\u201383.Altham, p. 260. Frank Woolley was playing and he recalled in his memoir that Blythe was unlucky not to take all twenty wickets in the match (this has never been done in first-class cricket). He says Blythe was affected by dropping an absolute \"sitter\" off his own bowling but that was in the first innings, not the second. The first wicket in the second innings was taken by Bill Fairservice so the all-twenty goal was never on once that wicket fell.Woolley, p. 65."]}, {"page": "Wally Hardinge", "response": ["In his early career Hardinge was considered a more promising bowler than batsman. He bowled slow left arm spinners well enough to take 371 career wickets in a Kent side which featured great spin bowlers such as Colin Blythe and Tich Freeman as well as Woolley and Bill Fairservice. He took six wickets for nine runs on a turning pitch at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells in 1929 and had a career best return of 7/64 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1932. He was described by Wisden as one of the \"finest outfields in the world\"."]}, {"page": "Richard Turner (Worcestershire cricketer)", "response": ["Of his four first-class wickets, three came in the same innings in July 1911, when he accounted for Kent's Jack Hubble, Bill Fairservice and Charlie Blythe to finish with 3-7."]}, {"page": "Colin Fairservice", "response": ["Fairservice was born in Hadlow in Kent in 1909, the son of Bill Fairservice who made over 300 first-class appearances for Kent between 1902 and 1921.Colin Fairservice, CricInfo.
