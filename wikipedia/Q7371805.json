It was created by first editor Jamie Maclean, who ceded control to Rowan Pelling in 1997. Pelling staged a management buyout from the Erotic Print Society in 2001, after a successful tenure that saw circulation figures rise to 30,000. As the magazine's parent company had been experiencing financial difficulties, Pelling was able to purchase Erotic Review for only \u00a31 plus liabilities. In mid-2003 Pelling sold Erotic Review to media mogul Felix Dennis, whose company Dennis Publishing controlled titles including Maxim. In late 2004 Erotic Review was sold again, this time to a top-shelf magazine publisher.
