His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008\u201309 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1\u20131 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying \"I do not see it as a big deal. It's not like the club has said to me we are putting you on the transfer list because we do not want you anymore\", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to \"pay a bit of money\". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3\u20132 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; \"moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is not what I want to do\". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3\u20130 home defeat."]}, {"page": "1995 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["In the 80th minute, Iain Dunn was then brought on for Gary Crosby while Bristol Rovers made their first change at the same time with Marcus Browning replacing Taylor.
