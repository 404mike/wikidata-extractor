Whilst with Leeds he was part of the team who won the First Division in 1992. He also appeared in the Football League for Bolton Wanderers.\nFollowing retirement, he worked for Grimsby Town as a scout before largely working away from the sport, before working as a coach and an agent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich City F.C.", "response": ["|1995|| Jon Newsome"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Jon Newsome"]}, {"page": "Dean Ashton", "response": ["Ashton joined Norwich City from Crewe Alexandra for a fee of \u00a33\u00a0million in January 2005, breaking the club's transfer record previously held by the \u00a31\u00a0million deal that brought Jon Newsome to Norwich City from Leeds United in 1994, although this record was later broken by the \u00a33.5m transfer of Robert Earnshaw to Carrow Road from West Bromwich Albion.

Bolton's loss at Chelsea coupled with Everton's draw against Coventry City meant that Gu\u00f0ni and Bolton were back in Division One. That season, Gu\u00f0ni scored one of the goals of the season; on 26 December 1997, Bolton played a home match against fellow strugglers Barnsley with both needing vital league points to climb away from trouble. Gu\u00f0ni equalised for the Trotters shortly before half time with a 35-yard shot from right-back which sailed into the top corner past the goalkeeper David Watson. The next season saw Gu\u00f0ni suffer a series of niggling injury problems and was one of his most frustrating seasons at Bolton. Players such as Mark Fish, Andy Todd, Jon Newsome and Paul Warhurst had all played in the heart of the defence in his absence, rumours even circulated that he may leave but this was soon dispelled."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Jon Newsome, footballer"]}]}}
