He was known for his versatility and longevity, being the only horse ever to be top rated over 2 miles, 2.5 miles and 3 miles in the same season. He is also the first horse ever to win a grade 1 race in 6 consecutive seasons - he then added 2 more the following season to make it 7. His Racing Post rating of 192 is the highest ever awarded to a National Hunt horse. He won the Cheltenham Gold Cup twice, in 2007 and 2009, becoming the first horse to regain the cup, beating Denman by thirteen lengths in 2009, after losing it in 2008 by seven lengths behind Denman. He tried for three more years to win the race again, but the best placing he could achieve was in 2011, coming  third behind Long Run. He also won the King George VI Chase a record five times. He was one of the most successful steeplechasers of modern era finishing his racing career with a National Hunt record of \u00a33,775,883 in earnings, which consisted of \u00a32,375,883 in race prize money, \u00a31,000,000 bonus for the completion of the 2006/2007 Stayers Chase Triple Crown and also a \u00a3400,000 reward for heading the BHA Table of Merit in the same 2006/2007 season.", "Kauto Star first came to the attention of Paul Nicholls when he saw a video of him in action at Auteuil. Nicholls then sought to arrange a purchase through his bloodstock agent in France, Anthony Bromley. Nicholls arranged an owner in the shape of Clive Smith, who was looking to purchase a horse and had recently had a 500,000 guineas offer for another horse (Garde Champetre) outbid by J. P. McManus. He used 400,000 euro to purchase Kauto Star from his French owners.", "Kauto Star had an additional challenge to face during the 2007/08 as another of Paul Nicholls' horses, Denman, had easily won the Royal & SunAlliance Chase, the top race for novice 3 mile chasers, at the previous season's Cheltenham Festival when also ridden by Ruby Walsh.  Nicholls stated his intention to keep the pair apart for the majority of the season, with the two horses not scheduled to race against each other until the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March.", "Kauto Star again began the season in the Old Roan Chase at Aintree, where he faced three rivals: Melling Chase winner Monet's Garden, Gold Cup runner up Exotic Dancer and Ashley Brook. Before the race, Paul Nicholls warned that Kauto Star, who started the 10/11 favourite, needed the run. During the closing stages of the race, he chased leader Monet's Garden but could not catch him. Monet's Garden won by 1\u00bd lengths from Kauto Star, who was giving him a stone in weight, with Exotic Dancer a further 20 lengths back in third. Kauto Star continued to follow the same path as last season and next started in the Betfair Chase, where he was ridden by Sam Thomas due to regular jockey Ruby Walsh being out injured with a dislocated shoulder. Despite his previous defeat, he again started as the odds-on favourite. During the race, he was pushed all the way to the finish by Exotic Dancer, but held on to win by \u00bd length. The two were well clear of the rest of the seven-runner field.", "Kauto Star then headed to Kempton Park, for the King George VI Chase. With Walsh back in the saddle, he won by 11 lengths from Ascot Chase winner Our Vic, with Exotic Dancer in third place. The horse's final preparation for the Cheltenham Gold Cup was in the Ascot Chase over 2 miles 5 furlongs. By this time, Walsh had announced his intention to ride Kauto Star in the Gold Cup, with Sam Thomas booked to ride Denman. Kauto eased to victory, winning by eight lengths from Monet's Garden. However, it was reported that Kauto Star was understood to be slightly lame after the race. Paul Nicholls revealed that his vet had examined Kauto Star that morning and that the horse appeared to have an infection in one of his hind feet.", "Kauto Star began his season in the JNwine.com Champion Chase at Down Royal. After tracking the leaders, he went on to win by four lengths from Arkle Challenge Trophy winner Sizing Europe. His next race was an attempt to win a record-breaking fifth consecutive King George VI Chase in a meeting which was rearranged to mid-January after the original Boxing Day fixture was postponed due to snow. He was once more sent off the odds-on favourite. Ruby Walsh was injured, and multiple champion jockey Tony McCoy came in for the ride for the first time.  Kauto Star looked beaten when blundering at the second last. Long Run won the race by 12 lengths from Riverside Theatre, who was a further 7 lengths clear of Kauto Star. It was the first time since coming to the UK that Kauto Star finished outside the first two in a completed race. In the aftermath of the race, there were calls for Kauto Star to be retired as there was a school of thought that age had caught up with the horse.  It was discovered he was suffering from a low-grade infection and had bled during the race for the first time. Paul Nicholls announced that Kauto Star would be trained for the Gold Cup as originally planned.", "At the end of February 2012, Paul Nicholls announced that Kauto Star had suffered an \"awful fall\" during a routine schooling session at his training yard, putting his participation in the Gold Cup in doubt. Intensive physiotherapy and walking exercise brought about a rapid improvement and a week before the Gold Cup, Kauto Star took part in a racecourse gallop at Wincanton Racecourse which pleased connections and put him back on track for the Cheltenham showpiece event. However, in the race he was pulled up with more than a lap remaining. The race was won by Synchronised. While Kauto Star suffered no major injuries, owner Clive Smith stated that he would most likely be retired. At the end of the season, he was the highest rated steeplechaser for a fourth time.", "His trainer, Paul Nicholls, and his owner, Clive Smith, subsequently disagreed over how he should spend his post-racing career. As a result, the horse left Nicholls' yard at Ditcheat on 11 December 2012 and was sent to Laura Collett who, together with Yogi Breisner, the coach of the Great Britain dressage team, assessed the horse to determine if he was suitable for the sport.  Clive Smith said of Nicholls: \"He is trying emotional blackmail, saying that Kauto Star would be better off staying at Ditcheat to be Clifford Baker's hack. I always want to do the best for Kauto Star.
