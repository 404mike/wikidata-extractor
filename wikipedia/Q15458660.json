He was introduced to Reynolds, who advised him to study nature, rather than the Old Masters. Lawrence set up a studio at 41 Jermyn Street and installed his parents in a house in Greek Street. He exhibited several works in the 1787 Royal Academy exhibition at Somerset House, and enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy but did not stay long, abandoning the drawing of classical statues to concentrate on his portraiture. In the Royal Academy exhibition of 1788 Lawrence was represented by five portraits in pastels and one in oils, a medium he quickly mastered. Between 1787 and his death in 1830 he would miss only two of the annual exhibitions: once, in 1809, in protest about the way his paintings had been displayed and once, in 1819, because he was abroad. In 1789 he exhibited 13 portraits, mostly in oil, including one of William Linley and one of Lady Cremorne, his first attempt at a full-length portrait.Levey 2005: 77\u201379 The paintings received favourable comments in the press with one critic referring to him as \"the Sir Joshua of futurity not far off\" and, aged just twenty, Lawrence received his first royal commission, a summons arriving from Windsor Palace to paint the portraits of Queen Charlotte and Princess Amelia.Levey 2005: 76\u201377 The queen found Lawrence presumptuous (although he made a good impression on the princesses and ladies-in-waiting) and she did not like the finished portrait, which remained in Lawrence's studio until his death. When it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1790, however, it received critical acclaim.Levey 2005: 85\u201390 Also shown that year was another of Lawrence's most famous portraits, that of the actress Elizabeth Farren, soon to be the Countess of Derby, \"completely Elizabeth Farren: arch, spirited, elegant and engaging\", according to one newspaper.Levey 2005: 92"]}, {"page": "1800 in literature", "response": ["*William Linley \u2013 Forbidden Apartments"]}, {"page": "Dulwich Picture Gallery", "response": ["The gallery attracted donors from its earliest days.

According to Michael Kelly, when young, Mrs Linley was \"reckoned beautiful\". The couple had 12 children over an 18-year period from 1753 until 1771, but only eight lived beyond infancy or childhood. Seven went on to musical or theatrical careers: Elizabeth Ann Linley (1754\u20131792), his eldest daughter, wife of Richard Brinsley Sheridan; his eldest son Thomas Linley the younger (1756\u20131778), composer and noted violinist; Mary Linley (1758\u201387), who gave up her career as a singer after she married playwright Richard Tickell in 1780; Samuel Linley (1760\u20131778), second son, singer and oboe player; Maria Linley (1763\u201384), singer; Ozias Thurston Linley (1765\u20131831), minor canon at Norwich and organist at Dulwich; and William Linley, (1771\u20131835), composer of glees, songs and writer.
