Fitzgerald said that Abi is \"just so happy\" to be having a baby so she can receive \"unconditional love\", which Abi longs for as she \"keeps losing that\" within her family and with the death of Steven.\" Although Lauren is \"fuming\" in the aftermath of learning about Abi's baby, Fitzgerald states that Abi regards it as a \"relief [...] she's got this massive weight off her chest.\" The hatred between Abi and Lauren comes out in an \"explosive\" manner, with the anger coming from Abi's betrayal and not Steven's and the fact the baby \"will be too much as it means Steven will be around forever.\"", "| A woman who works at Weyland & Co, and interviews Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), alongside her colleague Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre).
