Innes Ireland, who had broken his leg at Monaco, was back in action for Team Lotus, which had new Lotus 21s for Ireland and Jim Clark. Ferrari had a fourth car painted up in Belgian racing yellow for Olivier Gendebien, which was being run by Ecurie Nationale Belge, which also had a pair of Emeryson chassis for Lucien Bianchi and Willy Mairesse. These were both damaged in practice and so Bianchi and Mairesse took over the non-qualified Lotus 18's with Tony Marsh and Wolfgang Seidel. British Racing Partnership was also in trouble with only one Lotus 18 to be shared by Cliff Allison and Henry Taylor.

Stirling Moss was out of action. Tony Brooks had switched from the BRP Cooper team to try the new Vanwall VW11, while Team Lotus had hired Ron Flockhart to replace Alan Stacey. BRP had two new drivers in Henry Taylor and Bruce Halford. In practice both Scarabs blew their engines so neither Lance Reventlow nor Chuck Daigh was able to race. Jack Brabham was on pole position by 1.4 seconds with Phil Hill's Ferrari and Graham Hill's BRM sharing the front row. Behind them were Innes Ireland's factory Lotus 18 and the Ferrari of Willy Mairesse. At the start, Graham Hill was caught unprepared and as he tried to get the BRM off the line he was hit from behind by the Scuderia Centro Sud Cooper of Maurice Trintignant. There was also a collision between Brooks and Lucien Bianchi's outdated Cooper. The battle for the lead involved Brabham and Phil Hill and the pair switched places lap after lap until Hill began to fade with transmission trouble. A similar problem took out third-placed Ferrari driver Wolfgang Von Trips and so Brabham was left out in front all by himself. Mairesse too retired with a similar problem and Ireland had to stop with a broken front suspension. Also retiring were the two surviving BRMS of Dan Gurney and Jo Bonnier disappeared with engine trouble. This left Gendebien in the BRP Cooper to take second with Bruce McLaren third in the second factory Cooper and with Taylor finishing fourth in his BRP Cooper the company could boast 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 finish. The Lotuses of Jim Clark and Flockhart finished fifth and sixth.", "Although there was only a fortnight between the French and British GPs there were several changes when the F1 circus arrived at Silverstone. The Vanwall VW11 did not re-appear: Tony Brooks going back to his BRP Cooper and with both Scarabs having blown up at Reims they were not present although Chuck Daigh and Lance Reventlow shared a third factory Cooper, Daigh being faster and thus getting to race. Aston Martin showed up with DBR5s for Roy Salvadori and Maurice Trintignant while motorcycle ace John Surtees re-appeared in a works Lotus and there was the usual crop of British privateers including Keith Greene in the Gilby Engineering Cooper-Maserati and Brian Naylor in his JBW-Maserati. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Jack Brabham, a second faster than Graham Hill's BRM with Bruce McLaren's Cooper and Jo Bonnier's BRM making it a balanced front row. The start saw three cars stall: Graham Hill (his second race running) and the two BRP Coopers of Brooks and Henry Taylor. McLaren was second on the first lap but soon dropped behind Bonnier and the factory Lotus of Innes Ireland. Ireland then passed Bonnier to take second place. Graham Hill drove a storming race from the back of the field and worked his way back, passing Ireland for second after 37 laps and setting off after Brabham. To the delight of the crowd, he caught him and on lap 55 took the lead. Further back Surtees displaced Ireland in third place. Hill had been suffering brake problems for some time and on lap 72, he spun at Copse Corner and was out. Brabham took the lead and five laps later took the chequered flag with Surtees and Ireland second and third for Team Lotus.", "With the German Grand Prix being cancelled after safety concerns and complaints about the general quality of the AVUS track in Berlin, there was a month between the British and Portuguese GPs and at the challenging and dangerous Boavista street circuit in Porto Stirling Moss made his F1 comeback after being out of action since the disastrous Belgian GP in June. The only other change of note was that local hero Mario Cabral was found a drive in the second Scuderia Centro Sud Cooper-Maserati. In practice, Henry Taylor crashed his BRP Cooper heavily and injured his arm while Jim Clark smashed up his Lotus in a rare crash. Despite the accident, pole position went to Team Lotus driver John Surtees, who edged out Dan Gurney's BRM by a few hundredths of a second. Jack Brabham was third quickest in his normally-dominant works Cooper. Moss put his Walker Lotus on the second row alongside Graham Hill's BRM. Brabham took the lead at the start but Gurney quickly found a way ahead and then Brabham went wide at one corner and dropped to sixth place. Moss emerged second with Surtees and Phil Hill in his Ferrari fighting with him. After 10 laps, Gurney dropped back with an oil leak and so Surtees took the lead with Moss in pursuit but he had to stop because of spark plug problems and dropped to the back of the field. He was later disqualified for driving against the direction of the race while trying to get going after a spin. Brabham had a lively fight with Phil Hill until the American crashed and this became the lead on lap 36 when Surtees went off because oil had leaked onto his pedals. Bruce McLaren came through to finish second to give Cooper another 1\u20132 result with Clark finishing third in his cobbled-together Lotus. Brabham's victory meant that he clinched the World Championship with two races remaining. But this was to be the last Portuguese Grand Prix for 24 years \u2013 the race would not return until 1984.", "|align=\"left\"|  Henry Taylor"]}, {"page": "1959 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Henry Taylor", "|align=\"left\"|  Henry Taylor"]}, {"page": "Graham Whitehead", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Henry Taylor"]}, {"page": "British Racing Partnership", "response": ["| align=\"left\"|  Henry Taylor", "|align=\"left\"|  Henry Taylor", "| align=\"left\"|  Henry Taylor", "| align=\"left\"|  Henry Taylor"]}, {"page": "Formula Ford", "response": ["At an informal meeting at the December 1966 racing car show day at Olympia, Webb and Clarke were discussing the possibility of building a fleet of identical open wheel race cars based on the success of combining the Ford power plant and road wheels, radial tires, and Formula Junior style chassis.

["The Cooper T52 was the first series of Formula Junior racing cars produced by the Cooper Car Company, built for the 1960 racing season. Its chassis frame comprised four longitudinal tubes with hoops at the cowl and behind the driver. Unequal length A arms supported the car with coil springs at the front and a transverse leaf spring at the rear. BMC provided the power-plant with the 'A' series engine married to a Citro\u00ebn box. John Surtees debuted on four wheels in a Cooper T52 at Goodwood in March 1960 when he came second to Jim Clark. The T52 was often outpaced by the Lotus 18 but Henry Taylor managed to win the prestigious Monaco Cup and the Albi Grand Prix driving a MKI Formula Junior T52."]}, {"page": "1960 International Gold Cup", "response": ["|  Henry Taylor"]}]}}
