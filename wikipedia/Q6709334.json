The trio were likened to the Greek chorus, and the three witches in William Shakespeare's Macbeth, as they would sit in the snug bar of The Rovers Return Inn, passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.Tinker. p. 31. Headstrong Ena often clashed with the much younger Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix), whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which most of the time had little basis in reality."]}, {"page": "Ena Sharples", "response": ["Ena was the widowed caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall and spent much of her time criticising the activities and loose morals of the street's other residents. One of the main characters during the 1960s, she was featured less regularly in the 1970s due to the declining health of actress Violet Carson, and was written out in 1980. Almost always wearing a double-breasted overcoat and hairnet, she spent much of her free time in the serials' early years with her two cronies, Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol) and Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), in the snug bar of local pub The Rovers Return Inn, drinking milk stout. Ena particularly criticised Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix), who she believed had loose morals. In turn, Elsie strongly disliked Ena for her seemingly incessant gossip and desire to know about the private lives of others; and the two confronted each other frequently.", "Ena Schofield was born in Weatherfield on 24 November 1899. She had two elder siblings, Alice Raynold (n\u00e9e Schofield) (1885\u20131965) and Tom Schofield (d. 1973). During her school days Ena met Martha Hartley (Lynne Carol) and Minnie Carlton (Margot Bryant), establishing lifelong friendships. An attentive student with a strong Christian upbringing, Ena became devoted to her religion and developed a firm belief in the importance of rules, regulations and morals. She also quickly learned to be self-sufficient, taking on factory work when she was only 11.", "In 1960, Ena was in conflict with the Mission's new lay preacher Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), who objected to her frequenting the Rovers. Ena collapsed due to the stress, but walked out of hospital to return to her post so that Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol), who had taken on her responsibilities while she recovered, could not steal her job. In 1961, Ena was sacked for spreading a rumour that Coronation Street was being demolished, which turned out to be untrue. Swindley was forced to re-hire her when a suitable replacement could not be found (Ena had bribed the other candidates to turn the job down). Still unhappy with the working conditions, however, Ena walked out of the job later in the year and moved in with Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), with Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth) briefly taking on the caretaker position. She was eventually offered her job back."]}, {"page": "Margot Bryant", "response": ["Bryant's most notable television role came later in life, playing elderly timid Minnie Caldwell on the soap opera Coronation Street, a role she occupied from 1960 to 1976 over the course of 986 episodes. The character's life tended to revolve around her ginger tom-cat, Bobby. Minnie Caldwell was a diminutive figure, with a distracted manner and often appeared drinking milk stout in the snug of the soap's public house the Rovers Return Inn. The character, consequently, was a put-upon companion of her two friends busybody Martha Longhurst (played by Lynne Carol) and the elderly battleaxe Ena Sharples (played by Violet Carson). Bryant suffered severe memory loss (amnesia) in March 1976, and was unable to continue in the role; her penultimate episode involved her reading her lines off prompts and on props such as her handbag and her final episode was broadcast in April 1976. Her on-screen absence was explained by mentioning that her character had moved to live with an old friend, Handel Gartside (played by Harry Markham) in Derbyshire."]}, {"page": "Rovers Return Inn", "response": ["* 13 May 1964: Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol) dies after suffering a heart attack in the snug of The Rovers.", "In 1964, the producership of Coronation Street was handed to young, enthusiastic Tim Aspinall. He immediately began to ring changes. Since it had been fully networked across the various ITV regions in 1961, Coronation Street had never been out of the top ten ratings of the week (that continues to this day, 50 years on).  However, competition came from the BBC (there were only two channels in those days, BBC Television and ITV \u2013 BBC 2 was to follow later that year).  The BBC placed their most popular comedy series such as Steptoe and Son opposite the programme.  In those pre-video recorder days, viewers were forced to choose what to watch, and, as a consequence, Coronation Street began to lose the ratings war. It was decided, by Aspinall, that several \"blockbuster\" storylines would have to be staged, the most radical being the death of Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol)."]}, {"page": "The Killing of Sister George", "response": ["The story is usually regarded as a parody of the killing of Grace Archer in The Archers (an episode much better known at the time the play was written than it would be in the 21st century).

Though Martha was said to be the second-oldest character in the programme, 46-year-old Carol was given the part of the 64-year-old Martha. Her relative youth compared with her co-stars was obscured by the character's wardrobe, with Martha normally wearing a hairnet, beret, spectacles, and an old mackintosh, all of which were provided by Carol who bought them second-hand in a jumble sale."]}, {"page": "Terry Duckworth", "response": ["Pivaro joined the cast as Terry in 1983.
