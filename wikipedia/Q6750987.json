The players at Leeds received the news well, but were concerned that Stein had never shown any previous interest in managing in England. Early results were mixed, although the Leeds chairman Manny Cussins detected some improvement from the previous few seasons, when Leeds had slipped from their dominant position in English football. Attendances at Elland Road were low and Stein apparently missed the pressure of big games against foreign opposition.", "The day after MacLeod's departure journalist Jim Reynolds had written in The Glasgow Herald in relation to Scotland's search for a new manager that \"The ideal choice would, of course, have been Jock Stein, but the SFA  are five weeks too late\" adding that it was \"most unlikely\" that he could be tempted to take the Scotland job \"until he has given it a real go and Elland Road.\" However the next day Reynolds wrote in the same newspaper that Stein was a front runner for the job and reported that former Scotland boss Willie Ormond considered him to be \"the obvious choice\" if he would be prepared to take the job. Stein was quoted as saying \"There is little I can say about the situation. If Scotland want me they must approach the club first.\" However the report ended by quoting Manny Cussins as stating he was \"certain Jock Stein is happy at Leeds and will not leave to take the Scottish job\". He also indicated that if players could be \"worth \u00a3400,000, Jock Stein must be worth four million pounds.\""]}, {"page": "The Damned United", "response": ["*Henry Goodman as Manny Cussins"]}, {"page": "Bob Lord (football chairman)", "response": ["Lord was a guest of honour at a dinner given by the Variety Club of Great Britain in March 1974, but his speech led to a walkout by participants. Lord said: \"We have to stand up against a move to get soccer on the cheap by the Jews who run TV.\" Manny Cussins, who was Jewish and chairman of Leeds United, said he would walk out of the Elland Road boardroom if Lord visited when Burnley was playing there. Lord told his own board to stay away from the game."]}]}}
