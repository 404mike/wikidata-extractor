Thereafter he worked for design studios in London, embarking upon a career as a freelance illustrator in 1972.Sibbick's artwork has toured group shows like \"Dinosaurs: a Global View\", and he has had many one man shows in the United Kingdom, including at the Natural History Museum, London, the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh and Sea Dragons Gallery in Bristol, and abroad, such as at the Gamagori Museum, Japan. Sibbick designed the dragons for Animal Planet's The Last Dragon, whilst the pterosaur Ludodactylus sibbicki was named after John Sibbick in 2003. A set of postage stamps featuring Dinosaurs designed by Sibbick was issued by Royal Mail in 2013.In addition to his natural history work, Sibbick is also known for his work in the fantasy genre, having produced fantasy illustrations for Time Life Books, and numerous covers and interior illustrations for Puffin's Fighting Fantasy line. During the late 1980s, Sibbick became associated with Games Workshop when he provided the cover painting for the first edition of the company's Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay rules. He went on to produce covers for the third edition of Warhammer Fantasy Battle and the first edition of Warhammer 40,000, an image later used by death metal band Bolt Thrower for the cover of their album Realm of Chaos, as well as a cover for the Warhammer supplement Realm of Chaos: Slaves of Darkness. A number of these pieces graced the covers of various issues of White Dwarf, and he provided an original illustration of the titular White Dwarf himself for the cover of issue 90. Sibbick and his work were featured in an Illuminations expos\u00e8 in White Dwarf 83.Sibbick's colour work is executed in gouache on artist's board, and often benefits from the production of detailed preparatory sketches and even 3D models for reference.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science fiction and fantasy artists", "response": ["*John Sibbick"]}, {"page": "List of Fighting Fantasy gamebooks", "response": ["| 23 || Masks of Mayhem || Robin Waterfield || John Sibbick || Russ Nicholson || 400 || 1986 || ", "| 26 || Crypt of the Sorcerer || Ian Livingstone || Les Edwards || John Sibbick || 400 || 1987 || ", "| 29 || Midnight Rogue || Graeme Davis || John Sibbick || John Sibbick || 400 || 1987 || ", "| Shadowmaster || Ian Livingstone & Marc Gascoigne || John Sibbick || Russ Nicholson || 1992 || ", "| Dungeoneer || Marc Gascoigne & Pete Tamlyn || John Sibbick || John Sibbick || 1989 || ", "| Blacksand! || Marc Gascoigne & Pete Tamlyn || John Sibbick || Russ Nicholson || 1990 || ", "| Allansia || Marc Gascoigne & Pete Tamlyn || John Sibbick || Russ Nicholson || 1994 || ", "| 6 || Crypt of the Sorcerer || Ian Livingstone || Les Edwards || John Sibbick || 400 || 2002 || "]}, {"page": "Bolt Thrower", "response": ["They were not satisfied with the deal with Vinyl Solution as it was a pure hardcore label at that time. The label did little promotion for Bolt Thrower and their blend of death metal and hardcore punk, so after one album Bolt Thrower decided to leave Vinyl Solution and were signed by Earache Records. Earache Records had also signed many other death metal bands including Carcass and Napalm Death. The artwork for their second album was created by John Sibbick under contract for Games Workshop for the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook released in 1987. After Games Workshop heard the recording of the songs for Bolt Thrower's second Peel session, which was recorded on 6 November 1988, they offered to supply the artwork for Bolt Thrower's album, an offer the band quickly accepted. The record was released in 1989, titled Realm of Chaos: Slaves to Darkness, after the 1988 book of the same name published by Games Workshop. Most of the lyrics to the songs were also influenced by the game, but not merely because of the deal with Games Workshop. Karl, Andy and Gavin were very much into the games Games Workshop produced and they wrote a couple of songs about these games, including \"Plague Bearer\" and \"World Eater\". After the recording of Realm of Chaos, they went on the 'Grindcrusher Tour' with labelmates Napalm Death, Carcass and Morbid Angel. On the Cenotaph EP one song (\"Realm of Chaos\") appears that is recorded during this tour. This EP also features the two CD-bonus tracks from War Master and Realm of Chaos plus the song \"Cenotaph\".", "Since releasing Those Once Loyal, Earache has released a remastered edition of the 1989 album Realm of Chaos featuring alternate artwork by John Sibbick, the artist responsible for the original artwork of both the Warhammer 40,000 Rogue Trader cover and Realm of Chaos - Slaves to Darkness. The band encouraged people not to buy it as, like Who Dares Wins, it was released without their consultation let alone consent.
