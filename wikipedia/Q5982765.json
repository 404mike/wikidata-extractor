He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Retford, and Downing College, Cambridge (he earned firsts in both parts of the English Tripos) where he was a pupil of F. R. Leavis.  Robinson served as lecturer and senior lecturer in the English Department at University College of Swansea from 1961 to 1997 Best known for his 1973 book The Survival of English, Robinson has been a champion of traditional English literature and a critic of what he alleges to be the degeneration of the English language in modern life. With David Sims, he co-founded The Brynmill Press Ltd, in 1970, a company devoted to serious criticism which began with the quarterly review The Human World (1970\u20134) and went on to publish works of literary criticism, philosophy (including Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s Remarks on Frazer\u2019s \u201cGolden Bough\u201d), fiction, and poetry.\nRobinson's book The New Grammarians' Funeral was a critique of Noam Chomsky's generative grammar. It was well received by few linguists.Robinson was a critic of the Matthew Arnold, T. S. Eliot, and F. R. Leavis tradition, as discussed in his book The English Prophets. Along with works of pure literary criticism on Chaucer, he has published much in a category he calls \u201ccriticism of language\u201d, beginning with The Survival of English, which includes comments on the language of the media, of religion, of politics. He thinks that judgement is always a refinement of a sense held in common, and in 2008 published Holding the Centre, trying to demonstrate that a number of the Arts subjects have become incoherent by losing their place in the common language. He differed from his mentor Leavis by holding the view that judgement in literature cannot do without Christianity, and he has been a trustee of the Prayer Book Society.He died on 30 October 2020, at the age of 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas of Woodstock (play)", "response": ["In 2006 Michael Egan offered a case for Shakespeare's authorship of the play in a four volume (2100-page) variorum edition, which includes a book-length authorship analysis.

Egan claimed that Ian Robinson supported the attribution of the play to Shakespeare in a 1988 publication, Richard II and Woodstock.Robinson, Ian, Richard II and Woodstock, Brynmill Press, 1988 Retrieved 29 November 2013. but he cited no other adherents to this view.  Ward Elliott reported that he had performed stylometric analysis on the manuscript's text which he claimed discounts Egan's attribution.SHAKSPER 2005: Wager In a review of Egan's treatise for the Times Literary Supplement, Bart Van Es also challenged Egan's attribution, arguing that the verbal links he had found were often tenuous. Egan wagered \u00a31,000 that he could prove \"by clear, convincing and irrefutable evidence\" that Shakespeare wrote the play. In 2011, a panel of three independent Shakespeare scholars concluded that he had not done so, and that the play was not Shakespearean.http://shaksper.net/archive/2011/304-august/28082-thomas-of-woodstock; see, also, \"Poor Richards,\" SHK 25.080  Sunday, 16 February 2014 Eric Sams, in an appendix on Woodstock planned for the second volume of his The Real Shakespeare (2008), also presented linguistic and circumstantial arguments for Shakespeare's authorship of \"this powerful drama\".Sams, Eric, The Real Shakespeare: Retrieving the Later Years, 1594\u20131616,  p.342 (unfinished at the time of Sams' death, an edited text being published as an e-book by the Centro Studi \"Eric Sams\", 2008 ) "]}, {"page": "Second Aeon", "response": ["Robert Bly, Charles Bukowski, Emyr Humphreys, John James, George Macbeth, Yukio Mishima, Penelope Shuttle, David Tipton, Tristan Tzara, Herbert Williams, Jennifer Pike, Ian Robinson, and others"]}, {"page": "Retford Oaks Academy", "response": ["* Ian Robinson, literary critic and English lecturer"]}, {"page": "Ian Robinson", "response": ["Ian Robinson may refer to:", "*Ian Robinson (Australian football umpire) (born 1946), Australian Football League umpire active in the 1970s and 1980s", "*Ian Robinson (Australian politician) (1925\u20132017), Australian MP", "*Ian Robinson (author) (1937\u20132020), British literary critic", "*Ian Robinson (cricket umpire) (1947\u20132016), Zimbabwean cricket umpire active from 1992 to 2004", "*Ian Robinson (publisher) (1934\u20132004), writer, artist and editor of Oasis Books", "*Ian Robinson (rationalist) (born 1940), president of the Rationalist Society of Australia", "*Ian Robinson (squash player) (born 1952), former English professional squash player", "*Ian Robinson (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1970s, and 1980s", "*Ian Robinson, member of Black Lace"]}]}}
