The minority \"Wakefieldites\" (followers of Edward Gibbon Wakefield) opposed the move and tried to leave so that there would not be two-thirds of members present. This led to a violent turn when Sewell was reported to have pounced on the member for Nelson James Mackay and seized him by the throat. Suspension was moved an hour later when some members of the absent majority returned. Mackay was later found guilty of gross and premeditated contempt. There were moves to find the member from Dunedin James Macandrew guilty of contempt for entering the house with his hat on, but this was withdrawn."]}, {"page": "Alfred Christopher Picard", "response": ["On 31 July 1855, an additional member was to be elected for the Nelson Provincial Council.

He was one of eight children born to James Mackay senior and Ann (n\u00e9e Charles) between 1829 and 1848. Two cousins were also raised with the family, the oldest of which, Alexander Mackay, was two years younger than James Mackay junior and described by him as being like a brother. He also had two half sisters from James Mackay senior's second marriage after the death of Ann in 1860.", "In 1845 the family emigrated from London to Nelson Province in New Zealand on the Slains Castle. They established themselves just north of Nelson Town in an area called Wakapuaka on a farm they named Drumduan. Their land bordered on Maori reserve, and as James Mackay junior embraced colonial life, working twelve hour days on the farm as well as keeping up with his studies, he also became fluent in Maori.", "In 1852, when James Mackay turned 21, with the help of his father he established a cattle run below Farewell Spit in Golden Bay. At that time Golden Bay was completely isolated from the rest of province, with a population consisting almost entirely of Maori living in several villages along the coast. In 1855 the first three families of agricultural settlers arrived, and at about the same time a sawmill was established at Motupipi. There was soon conflict between the sawyers and local Maori, and concerned about the way it was dealt with, Mackay appealed to the Native Secretary Donald McLean to appoint him into a position to mediate between Maori and Pakeha (Europeans).", "thumb|Cartoon of commissioner James Mackay addressing gold miners at Thames entitled, \"The Thames Autocrat.\""]}, {"page": "1804 in Scotland", "response": ["* James Mackay, politician in New Zealand (died 1875 in New Zealand)"]}]}}
