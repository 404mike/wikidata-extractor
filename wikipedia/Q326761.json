Only days after signing for the club, Moloto scored the game-winning goal of a 2\u20130 victory over the Western Illinois Leathernecks of Western Illinois University in the Riverhounds' first preseason match of 2015. Moloto made his league debut for the Riverhounds on 28 March 2015 in the club's opening match of the 2015 season, a 5\u20132 victory over the Harrisburg City Islanders.

On May 30, 2015, the Riverhounds played what one columnist called the \"club\u2019s greatest ever game\" as the team scored three goals in stoppage time for a 6\u20135 victory over the Harrisburg City Islanders. In the match, Moloto became the first player to tally three assists in a single match in league history. The match's eleven total goals set a league regular season record for combined goals in a match.  Moloto finished the season with 6 goals and 7 assists in 24 league appearances, ranked third on the team in goals and second in assists and included a goal in each of the final two matches of the season which saw Pittsburgh qualify for the playoffs.

Although several warm-up matches and other non-soccer events were held at Highmark Stadium previously, the first official Riverhounds league match took place on April 13, 2013, against the Harrisburg City Islanders, several months after the anticipated completion date. The Riverhounds went on to lose the opening day match 1\u20132 in front of a sellout crowd of over 4,000 fans. Newly signed Riverhounds striker Jos\u00e9 Angulo opened the scoring in the match, thus scoring the first goal in the new stadium's history.  In summer 2013, the Riverhounds introduced the Frank B. Fuhrer International Friendly Series, an annual international friendly match pitting the Riverhounds against top clubs from around the world. The series was named after investor and local businessman Frank B. Fuhrer who was also former owner of the Pittsburgh Spirit indoor soccer team. The first edition of the series was held on July 19, 2013, as the Riverhounds fell 1\u20134 against reigning FA Cup holders Wigan Athletic with Jos\u00e9 Angulo again scoring the Riverhounds' only goal of the match. On the final matchday of the 2013 regular season, Angulo scored Pittsburgh's only goal in a 1\u20131 draw with the regular season champion Richmond Kickers. With the goal, Angulo tied Dom Dwyer's goal tally of 15 for the season but was crowned scoring champion on total points, with a total of 34 to 31, after he tallied four assists and Dwyer tallied only one. Angulo's 15 goals tied Dwyer for the all-time single season USL Pro scoring record, which was then broken by Kevin Molino of Orlando City SC the following season. At the end of the season, Angulo was also named USL Pro league MVP. Another single-season league record was set by a Pittsburgh player in 2013 as Matthew Dallman tallied twelve assists for the Riverhounds throughout the season.  This was the first time in league history that Riverhounds players led the league in both categories. On June 27, 2013, it was announced that Terry \"Tuffy\" Shallenberger of Connellsville, Pennsylvania became an investor in the club, a move that would have major significance to the club in the near future. Shallenberger also established a Riverhounds academy in his hometown at that time.  After a slow start to the season in which the Riverhounds recorded only two victories in its first ten matches, the club finished the regular season seventh in the league with a 10-8-8 record, qualifying for the playoffs. However, the Riverhounds did not make it out of the first round after suffering a heavy 0\u20135 defeat to Orlando City on August 24, 2013.", "On November 7, 2014, it was announced that the Riverhounds had emerged from voluntary bankruptcy. The club's plan moving forward called for seeking additional sponsorship opportunities so that the club and Highmark Stadium would be profitable within three years. It was also announced at that time that Jason Kutney would be kept on as the club's CEO and that Nikola Katic would be retained as an assistant coach after having finished the 2014 season as the club's interim head coach. The club began its search for a new head coach and an experienced club president. On December 17, 2014, the Riverhounds met both objectives by hiring championship-winning, longtime Charlotte Eagles head coach Mark Steffens as head coach and Englishman Richard Nightingale, a former executive at Nike, Inc., as president of both the Riverhounds and Highmark Stadium. Allegheny Health Network was then unveiled as the club's new jersey sponsor, replacing #1 Cochran Automotive. Some of Steffen's first changes included signing several former Charlotte Eagles players such as Drew Russell and Fejiro Okiomah, in addition to naming Josh Rife, another of Steffens' former players, as a second assistant coach and head coach of Pittsburgh Riverhounds U23. International players such as South African Lebogang Moloto, Brazilian Vini Dantas, Haitian Max Touloute, Jamaican Ryan Thompson, and Canadian Tyler Pasher were signed to the heavily revamped roster while Colombian Jos\u00e9 Angulo, 2013 league MVP, former record-holding goalscorer, and the Riverhounds' top scorer the previous two seasons, left the club and signed with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League. Another of Nightingale's first orders of business was dissolving the affiliation with the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer which was entered into the previous season, stating that the club preferred to remain without an MLS affiliate to have more autonomy and freedom with their own roster. However, former Dynamo loanee Anthony Arena returned to the club by signing outright with Pittsburgh after being released by the Dynamo at the end of the 2014 MLS season. The Riverhounds finished the 2015 preseason undefeated, getting results of four wins and one draw in five matches. The club continued its impressive performances into the regular season, earning a 5\u20132 opening day victory over the Harrisburg City Islanders on March 28, 2015. In the match Rob Vincent and Kevin Kerr lead the Pittsburgh offense with a brace and a hat-trick, respectively. The match marked the first time that the team had ever scored five goals in a single match at Highmark Stadium. Over the next five matches, the club went 1-2-2 and were winless on the road despite being the highest scoring team in the Eastern Conference and Rob Vincent leading the league in both goals and points at that point of the season. The club's performances were inconsistent to that point, alternating between low-scoring draws or losses and offensive outbursts. The midfield pairing of Rob Vincent and Kevin Kerr, who had tallied four goals and three assists himself, was described by one analyst as, \"the most entertaining pair of UK midfielders this side of the pond.\" The Riverhounds began their 2015 U.S. Open Cup campaign on May 20 with a 3\u20130 victory over the West Virginia Chaos with Vincent opening the scoring against his former team, Moloto scoring his first competitive goal for the club, and Kerr getting the final tally. The victory set up a third round encounter with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League at Highmark Stadium. The match would mark the first time that the Hounds had ever hosted a higher division club or a non-USL professional club for a competitive match at Highmark Stadium. With Vincent scoring the game-winner again, this time in stoppage time, the Riverhounds defeated the Rowdies 1\u20130, setting up an encounter with D.C. United of Major League Soccer at Highmark Stadium in the fourth round, the first match of any kind between the Riverhounds and a MLS side at Highmark Stadium. Three days later on May 30, 2015, the Riverhounds played what one columnist called the \"club's greatest ever game\" as the team scored three goals in stoppage time for a 6\u20135 victory over the Harrisburg City Islanders. Vincent and Danny Earls tallied braces for the club while Kerr scored the game-winner. Amara Soumah also scored his first league goal in the match while Ryan Hulings earned his first league appearance and victory. In the match, Lebo Moloto also became the first player to tally three assists in a single match in league history. The match's eleven total goals set a league regular season record for combined goals in a match. The Riverhounds 2015 U.S. Open Cup run came to an end on June 17 as D.C. United defeated the Hounds 3\u20131. The match was tied 1\u20131 after regulation time, with Vincent converting a penalty for Pittsburgh goal. D.C. United scored two goals in the two added 15-minute periods to earn the victory in front of a near-record crowd at Highmark Stadium. Entering the final two games of the regular season, Pittsburgh needed to earn four points to qualify for the playoffs. The Riverhounds drew 1\u20131 with the regular season champion Rochester Rhinos on September 16, setting up a decisive match away at rivals Harrisburg on the final matchday of the season. The Riverhounds went on to earn a 2\u20131 victory in the match, clinching a playoff spot and fifth place in the eastern conference, in addition to securing the inaugural Keystone Derby Cup between the two Pennsylvania clubs. The team's season came to an end with a 2\u20134 extra time defeat to the New York Red Bulls II in the first round of the playoffs. The club finished the regular season with 55 goals scored, the most scored by any team in the league.", "Only days after being eliminated from the 2015 playoffs, club president Richard Nightingale announced that Kevin Kerr and Rob Vincent would be returning for the 2016 season, while the club continued to identify new talent to add to the roster. However, in early October 2015, it was revealed that Vincent was on trial with D.C. United of Major League Soccer. On February 17, 2016, it was officially announced that Vincent had impressed D.C. United during their preseason and that he had been purchased by the club for an undisclosed amount. On November 2, 2015, it was announced that Richard Nightingale was no longer with the team and that Shallenberger had taken over as acting president. One source indicated the reason for the dismissal was a rift between the former general manager and the ownership, staff, and players created by Nightingale trying to impose his own decisions that Shallenberger preferred to leave to Steffens. However, multiple sources stated that Nightingale left the team on his own accord to pursue another opportunity and to return to his family in Oregon who did not travel with him to Pittsburgh. The same day, the Riverhounds officially moved into their new training facility, the Allegheny Health Network Sports Complex. The new facility allowed for year-round training and for all levels of the organization, from academy to first team, to practice at the same location. In November 2015 it was announced that Jamaican international goalkeeper Ryan Thompson and the Riverhounds agreed to mutually part ways in the offseason so that he could pursue a contract in Europe or Major League Soccer following his performances as Jamaica's starter at the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup. After one season without an MLS affiliate, it was announced that the club had formed an affiliate partnership with the reigning Eastern Conference playoff champion and MLS Cup runner-up Columbus Crew SC for the 2016 season. The partnership would make the Riverhounds the primary destination for loaned players throughout the USL season. The two clubs had worked together previously as Matt Lampson was loaned to the Riverhounds from the Crew during the previous season. The Riverhounds received Marshall Hollingsworth and Ben Swanson in March 2016 as the first players loaned through the affiliation. Prior to the opening game of the 2016 season, the Riverhounds unveiled a signature beer available at Highmark Stadium, Golden Hound Ale brewed by Pittsburgh-based Penn Brewery. Although three Major League Soccer clubs previously created signature beers, the Riverhounds became the first USL club to do so. Following the sixth match of the season on May 7, 2016, the contract of Romeo Parkes, the team's top goal scorer, was terminated after he kicked New York Red Bulls II defender Karl Ouimette from behind in an incident that sent the player to the hospital. The following week, the Riverhounds were part of a 0\u20131 defeat to FC Cincinnati which set the USL league attendance record for a single match with over 23,000 fans in attendance at Cincinnati's Nippert Stadium. After not recording a win in the club's first seven games of the season and being eliminated from the 2016 U.S. Open Cup after losing its first match to amateur side Landsdowne Bhoys FC 0\u20132, head coach Mark Steffens was relieved of his duties on May 21, 2016. The following morning Dave Brandt, head coach of the Navy Midshipmen, was named the club's new manager. The Hounds finished the season with a 6-17-7 record and missed the playoffs for the ninth time in the club's seventeen-season existence. Club owner Tuffy Shallenberger said during a September 2016 interview that he would be focusing on improving marketing for the club, including a possible total rebranding. The club's top scorer for the season was Corey Hertzog who scored 13 goals in 30 matches and finishing the league golden boot race in sixth place. He also led the club in games played, minutes, assists, points, shots and shots on goal. He was named to the USL League Second Team following the season.", "Notable offseason signings included former United States international Gale Agbossoumonde, Saint Kitts and Nevis international Devaughn Elliott, and Barbados international Keasel Broome. The Riverhounds opened the 2017 season at home against defending champions New York Red Bulls II on March 25, 2017. The match ended in a 3\u20133 draw, with two of the team's goals coming from Corey Hertzog and another from captain Kevin Kerr. The team was eliminated from the 2017 U.S. Open Cup with a 1 to 3 defeat to amateur side Chicago FC United in the second round. The team failed to make the playoffs. Corey Hertzog was the team's top scorer as he moved into third place on its all-time top scorers list. Following the 2017 season, it was announced that the affiliation between Columbus Crew SC and the Riverhounds that had been in place since 2015 had comes to an end. Reasons for the discontinuation included the potential move of the Crew franchise to Austin, Texas and the roster inconsistency that the affiliation caused."]}, {"page": "Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC records and results", "response": ["|2||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kevin Kerr||2013\u20132019||SC Wiedenbr\u00fcck||179||3||10||192", "|2||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kevin Kerr||2013\u20132019||SC Wiedenbr\u00fcck||29||0||3||32"]}, {"page": "2019 Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC season", "response": ["| 10 || Kevin Kerr ||  || MF ||  || 2013 ||  SC Wiedenbr\u00fcck || 191 || 32", "|align=left| Kevin Kerr", "|  Kevin Kerr", "|  Kevin Kerr"]}]}}
