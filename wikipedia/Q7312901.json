He left Peterborough permanently in July 2011 when he switched to Torquay United, and he established himself in the side over the next two years. Having made 89 appearances for Torquay, Howe joined Burton Albion in July 2013 but left by mutual consent in January 2014. He subsequently joined Newport County managed by his former Rushden & Diamonds manager Justin Edinburgh.\nAfter stints with Kettering (for a second time), and a short spell with Southern Football League side Hendon in the summer of 2018, Howe moved to fellow Southern League side Kings Langley in August 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walton Casuals F.C.", "response": ["*  Rene Howe"]}, {"page": "Taiwo Atieno", "response": ["Ahead of the 2011\u201312 season, Atieno went on a two-week trial with League Two side Torquay United.

A largely solid start to the season ensued with 27 points amassed from the first 16 matches. Then, in the FA Cup 4th Qualifying Round, Diamonds were drawn away to their fierce local rivals Kettering Town. Early goals from Lewwis Spence and Rene Howe (penalty) put the away side in firm control. They were reduced to ten men before the hour mark and although Paul Furlong pulled one back for the Poppies just afterwards, Rushden held on to secure a place in the next round and the local bragging rights. In the First Round Proper, however, a controversial 1\u20130 defeat against Yeovil Town ended any further progress in the competition. On 1 December Chairman Keith Cousins stepped down from his role and was replaced by Liam Beasant and Gary Calder. But much worse news was to follow in the coming weeks.

McDonald's subsequent suspension gave Davis the opportunity to start against Hereford United three days later, Adams saying \"he'll either sink or swim\". He was voted man of the match after he produced \"a disciplined defensive display beyond his tender years\". However, he was sent off 69 minutes into the next match for a professional foul on Torquay United's Rene Howe; the penalty kick was converted to cost Vale a 2\u20131 away defeat. With Clayton McDonald facing legal issues, Davis was given an extended run in the team towards the end of the 2011\u201312 season, thus securing the 18-year-old apprentice his first professional contract.

Olejnik came with a fine pedigree having played for Falkirk in the Scottish Premier League while Saah had previously played under Ling at Leyton Orient and Cambridge United.  With Chris Zebroski making the decision to follow former manager Paul Buckle to Bristol Rovers, Ling needed to improve his attacking options which led to the signings of strikers Rene Howe and Taiwo Atieno and midfielder Ian Morris. Finally, as back-up to Bobby Olejnik, former Gulls keeper Martin Rice returned to Plainmoor after two seasons with Truro City.", "The optimism of the new season was swiftly dashed when striker Justin Richards scored twice early in the second half to put Burton Albion 2\u20130 ahead in the opening day fixture at Plainmoor.  However, Torquay were able to show enough character to respond to this setback with Rene Howe and captain Lee Mansell both scoring to salvage a 2\u20132 draw. Next up was a trip to St Mary's for a Carling Cup First Round fixture with Southampton.  Despite a spirited performance, the Gulls were unable to overcome a strong Saints side and had to accept a 4\u20131 defeat as well as the fact that Torquay had now gone ten years without reaching the Second Round of the League Cup.  However, the Gulls did not have to wait much longer for their first victory of the season and it was to be a particularly enjoyable one for the Torquay fans as it came at the home of Paul Buckle's new side Bristol Rovers.  Goals from Taiwo Atieno and Rene Howe in the first fifteen minutes was enough to secure all three points at the Memorial Stadium, despite Byron Anthony snatching one back for Rovers in the second half.  Back to back away victories were then achieved with a hard-fought 1\u20130 win at Aldershot, pushing the Gulls up to 4th in the League Two table.  However, Torquay were soon brought back down to earth when newly promoted Crawley Town came to Plainmoor and easily outplayed the home side in a 3\u20131 defeat of the Gulls.  The consolation goal was Lee Mansell's fourth of the campaign and left the midfielder in the unlikely position as the club's top scorer for the season so far.", "With Rene Howe suffering from a hamstring injury and Billy Bodin on international duty with the Wales under-21 squad, Martin Ling was presented with a mini striker crisis before the visit of Macclesfield Town for the first fixture of the month. Despite this, Torquay managed to register their biggest win of the campaign so far with a 3\u20130 defeat of the Silkmen thanks to first goals of the season from Brian Saah, Chris McPhee and Eunan O'Kane.  Howe was fit enough to be restored to the starting line-up alongside Bodin for the next match which, ironically, resulted in a lacklustre 0\u20130 draw with Northampton Town at the Sixfields Stadium.  This was then followed up by two further draws against Cheltenham Town and Rotherham United, both at Plainmoor.  Although these were far more entertaining matches than the Northampton stalemate, it was concerning that Torquay had fallen behind within the first five minutes of both games.  However, the Gulls did at least show the desire to fight back in both games, gaining a 2\u20132 result against Cheltenham and finishing the epic Rotherham encounter with a 3\u20133 scoreline.  Nevertheless, Martin Ling was now growing concerned at the prospect of Torquay becoming the League's 'draw specialists'.", "Morale was boosted before the trip to Shrewsbury Town with the news that Eunan O'Kane had signed a new contract keeping the midfielder at Plainmoor until 2014. However, it was not such good news on the pitch with the Shrews gaining revenge for last season's play-off defeat, beating the Gulls 2\u20130 in a match which also saw Rene Howe dismissed for a second bookable offence.  It was a disappointing end to a month which left the Gulls in 13th position in the League Two table having started it in 12th. It was now becoming clear that if Torquay were to avoid a season of mid-table mediocrity (or worse), they would need to start converting some of their draws into wins.", "Torquay could hardly have asked for a much tougher FA Cup Second Round fixture than a trip to League One high-flyers Sheffield United.  However, it would take just three minutes before Rene Howe stunned the Bramall Lane crowd by firing the Gulls into an early 1\u20130 lead.  United managed to defend stoutly against the Blades up until the 68th minute when a cruel Mark Ellis own goal levelled it for the home side before striker Ched Evans made it 2\u20131 within a minute of the restart.  Evans then went on to score a second goal to put the tie beyond the reach of Torquay before Danny Stevens scored a late consolation goal in injury time.  It was an impressive Torquay performance but the defeat meant that the Gulls would now only have the League Two campaign to concentrate on for the rest of the season.", "Despite the cup exit, spirits were raised among the Torquay fans when it was announced that loyal servants Lee Mansell and Kevin Nicholson had both signed new contracts keeping them at Plainmoor until the summer of 2014. Nicholson celebrated his new deal by scoring deep into injury time to secure a 1\u20130 home win over Barnet.  However, this was then followed up by a poor performance against Accrington Stanley at the Crown Ground which saw Rene Howe sent off for the second time in the season.  Despite Accrington also later having a man sent off, the game resulted in a 3\u20131 defeat for Torquay and a four-match ban for Howe. Howe's suspension meant an opportunity for striker Taiwo Atieno to make his mark in the team having failed to find a regular place in the starting line up.  Atieno duly took his chance by scoring the only goal in the 1\u20130 defeat of Swindon in the Boxing Day fixture at Plainmoor, thus ending the Robins' 15-game unbeaten run.", "The march towards League One continued unabated with the Gulls' Good Friday encounter with Accrington resulting in the side's tenth 1\u20130 win of the season.  However, despite an early Rene Howe goal in the Easter Monday fixture with Oxford United, Torquay were perhaps fortunate to leave the Kassam Stadium with a point after Ian Morris was sent off in the 79th minute.  Only a late Taiwo Atieno strike salvaged a 2\u20132 draw for the Gulls after Oxford had already fought back to a 2\u20131 lead before the sending off.  However, the point did at least secure Torquay a place in the play-offs, although their sights were now firmly set on a much bigger prize.  The month's next fixture saw the visit of promotion-chasing rivals Southend to Plainmoor.  The two sides cancelled each other out in a 0\u20130 draw which did at least establish a new club record of 20 clean sheets in one season. The draw just managed to keep the Gulls in the automatic promotion spots although with both Shrewsbury and Crawley both winning their games in hand shortly afterwards, Torquay had dropped down to fourth spot before their trip to AFC Wimbledon.  A disappointing 2\u20130 defeat at Kingsmeadow did nothing to help the team's promotion prospects and appeared to suggest that Torquay's small squad may finally be running out of steam at the crucial moment.  However, the following week the Gulls seemed to have all three points in the bag back at home when they were 1\u20130 up against play-off hopefuls Crewe Alexandra before a 94th equaliser from Nick Powell robbed Torquay of two vital points.  Other results on the penultimate day of the season ensured Swindon were crowned champions of League Two while Shrewsbury became the second team to win automatic promotion.  However, a shock home defeat for Crawley at the hands of relegation threatened Hereford meant that only goal difference separated Torquay and Crawley for the vital third automatic promotion spot.  Meanwhile, just a point behind them both were Southend who could grab the coveted third spot if they won and Torquay and Crawley both failed to do so.  What would make the final day even more intriguing was the fact that Torquay had to travel to Crawley's victors Hereford who themselves would have to win their final match of the season to guarantee their League Two survival.", "|1 || FW ||  || 9 || Rene Howe || 12 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 14", "|9 ||  || FW || Rene Howe || 9 || 2 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 10 || 2", "|Rene Howe"]}]}}
