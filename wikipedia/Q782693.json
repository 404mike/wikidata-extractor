Then only one point was gained in the next six matches. To bolster the side in came Stoke City's veteran defender Eric Skeels, who was also returning from a spell in the USA. Mick Cullerton then severed a cartilage, which meant five months out of action for the star striker. To replace him Sproson signed Blackburn Rovers' Ken Beamish (\u00a312,000) and Wigan Athletic's John Rogers ('a small fee'). The club also made other clubs aware that they would listen to any offers for players, but there was little in the way of interest. In October, former England and Wolves defender Bobby Thomson was another player returning from the States. Signing with the Vale, he impressed so much that he was made club captain in his first week at Vale Park. A club record run of 42 away games without a clean sheet began on 18 December, and would last until 30 September 1978. The first of this run was a 1\u20131 draw with Rotherham United at Millmoor, after this match \"Millers\" boss Jimmy McGuigan stated that Vale showed 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Even though the defence struggled away from home, Beamish did not, as he scored his first ten goals for the club away from Burslem. In a 4\u20132 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on 3 January, Beamish scored a hat-trick.
