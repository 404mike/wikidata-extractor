In the great mixed invasion of 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. The crossing is described in Wallace Breem's historical novel Eagle in the Snow. The Chronicle of Fredegar gives the account. At Alba Augusta (Alba-la-Romaine) the devastation was so complete, that the Christian bishop retired to Viviers, but in Gregory's account at Mende in Loz\u00e8re, also deep in the heart of Gaul, bishop Privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated.  It is thought this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence."]}, {"page": "1970 in literature", "response": ["*Wallace Breem \u2013 Eagle in the Snow"]}, {"page": "List of historical novels", "response": ["*Eagle in the Snow by Wallace Breem (Magnus Maximus, 4th century)"]}, {"page": "List of librarians", "response": ["*Wallace Breem \u2013 novelist and law librarian"]}, {"page": "Legio XX Valeria Victrix", "response": ["Legio XX Valeria Victrix was the legion featured in the novel Eagle in the Snow; author Wallace Breem postulates that they were annihilated by the Germanic invasion of 406."]}, {"page": "Fiction set in ancient Rome", "response": ["* Eagle in the Snow (1970) by Wallace Breem; set in Britannia and Germania in the late 4th and early 5th century; features a Mithraic Roman general."]}, {"page": "Eagle in the Snow", "response": ["Eagle in the Snow () is a 1970 historical fiction novel, written by Wallace Breem, which revolves around the Roman general Paulinus Gaius Maximus, a Mithraic in an age of Christianization, in Britannia and Germania, between the late 4th century and the early 5th century."]}, {"page": "Great Conspiracy", "response": ["Fictional accounts of the Great Conspiracy were featured in Wallace Breem's historical novel Eagle in the Snow, Peter Vansittart's historical novel Three Six Seven: Memoirs of a Very Important Man, Stephen R.

The 2nd Harrogate Workshop in April concluded with a meeting which set up an Association of Law Librarians. This was the inaugural meeting and those who were present are BIALL\u2019s founder members. The first AGM was held in a basement room of the old IALS building in Russell Square on Monday 22 September. It was chaired by Willi Steiner, several hours were spent debating the minutiae of the draft Constitution. One of the decisions was to form a separate organisation, not affiliated to, or part of, the Library Association, resulting from strong arguments that organisations (especially law firms) who had no professional librarians, would be excluded from membership if the Association were part of the LA. The principle of welcoming professionally qualified and non-qualified law librarians into BIALL has prevailed ever since.", "The first officers were Don Daintree (Chairman), Wallace Breem (Secretary and Treasurer) and Betty Moys (Editor). An Executive Committee was subsequently elected and in November it set up a Sub-Committee of Betty Moys, Allan Appleby of Sweet and Maxwell, and Wallace Breem to produce a journal.", "BIALL administers and presents several awards at its annual conference dinner including the BIALL Supplier of the Year Award, the LexisLibrary Awards (formerly the Halsbury's Awards), the biannual Wallace Breem Award, the Betty Moys Award, the Legal Journals Award, and the Wildy Law Librarian of the Year Award."]}]}}
