On 16 February, the team travelled to Anfield to play Liverpool in the 5th round of the FA Cup and pulled off a surprise 2\u20131 victory, with a strong defensive display and a 'Man of the Match', 'Player of the Round' performance from loaned keeper Luke Steele (who was brought in at the last minute for cup-tied Tony Warner). After conceding a goal in the first half, it was Stephen Foster who equalised in the second and captain Brian Howard who scored the last-gasp winner which allowed them to progress to the quarter finals for the first time since 1999, where they would face Chelsea at Oakwell. Here, the Tykes put in a 'sensational' performance against the FA Cup holders and 'Player of the Round' Kayode Odejayi's second-half header (only his second goal of the season) was enough to put the Yorkshire side into the semi-final for the first time since they won the cup in 1912.

With Portsmouth the only Premiership side remaining in the competition, what had begun as a shock result at Anfield had now developed into a genuine chance to reclaim their FA Cup glory, and when they were drawn against Cardiff City in the semi-finals a repeat of the historic final versus West Bromwich Albion was well on the cards.

They went a goal down after half an hour after a goal from David Fox, and goalkeeper Heinz Muller had to be substituted at half-time due to injury, with reserve keeper Kyle Letheren coming on. With 15 minutes remaining, defender Stephen Foster scored his first goal for Barnsley with a crafty back-heel from a corner and four minutes later 19 year old striker Michael Coulson put his team ahead.", "A goal from Jon Macken, who had just signed a permanent deal to return to Oakwell after his loan spell, sealed Barnsley's first league win since early December to re-affirm the team's strong home record. The result was even better given the fact that keeper Heinz Muller played nearly the whole game on just one leg. Stephen Foster was forced to take his goal-kicks for him.", "Barnsley pulled off a huge shock in the fifth round of the FA Cup, beating Liverpool at Anfield to progress to the quarter finals for the first time since 1999. Dirk Kuyt opened the scoring in the first half, but Stephen Foster headed in the equaliser in the second while loaned goalkeeper Luke Steele made several saves to keep Barnsley in the game. It was captain Brian Howard with the last-gasp winner, a shot struck firmly into the bottom corner, after being denied a stonewall penalty", "Manager Simon Davey kept faith in controversial striker Kayode Odejayi by giving him another starting place in this match, and was rewarded with two goals from him; his second and third league goals of the season. Stephen Foster's headed goal from a Diego Le\u00f3n corner made this a surprisingly big win for Barnsley against the Premiership contenders, and only their second away win all season.", "Barnsley continued to claw themselves away from the relegation spots with an away win at Preston; their second of the week and fourth of the season.
