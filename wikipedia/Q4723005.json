The Corps itself lost 743 officers and 6130 soldiers in the war. However, far more of them, and thousands more of the sick and wounded they treated, would have died if it had not been for the civilian doctors working in South Africa as volunteers\u2014such as Sir Frederick Treves, Sir George Makins, Sir Howard Henry Tooth and Professor Alexander Ogston\u2014who, having seen how unprepared to deal with epidemics the RAMC and the Army itself were, decided that a radical reform was needed. Chief among them was Alfred Fripp, who had been chosen by the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital Committee to order all the necessary materials and medical personnel, and oversee the setting-up of a private hospital at Deelfontein to cater, initially, for 520 'sick and wounded.' The contrast between the smooth working of the IYH at Deelfontein with the chaos of the RAMC hospitals, where an enteric epidemic had overwhelmed the staff, led to questions in Parliament, mainly by William Burdett-Coutts. In July 1901 the first meeting of the Committee of Reform took place, with all the aforementioned civilian experts, plus Sir Edwin Cooper Perry, making up half the number; the rest were Army men, and included Alfred Keogh, whom the new Secretary of State for War, St John Brodrick, later Earl of Midleton, appointed Chairman of this Committee and the subsequent Advisory Committee. Neither would have met so soon\u2014if at all\u2014but for Fripp's concern to limit unnecessary suffering, and for his ten years' friendship with the new King, Edward VII. Fripp showed him his plans for reform and the King made sure that they were not shelved by his government. Part of his plan was to move the Netley Hospital and Medical School to a Thames-side site at Millbank, London. Cooper Perry, Fripp's colleague from Guy's Hospital, was instrumental in making this happen, as well as using his formidable talents as an organizer in other services for the Reform Committee. Fripp and Cooper Perry were knighted for their services to the RAMC Committee of Reform in 1903.", "During the First World War, the corps reached its apogee both in size and experience. The two people in charge of the RAMC in the Great War were Arthur Sloggett, the senior RAMC officer seconded to the IYH in Deelfontein who acquiesced in all Fripp's surprising innovations, and Alfred Keogh, whom Fripp recommended to Brodrick as an RAMC man well-regarded when Registrar of No.3 General Hospital in Cape Town. Its main base was for long the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital at Millbank, London (now closed). It set up a network of military general hospitals around the United Kingdom and established clinics and hospitals in countries where there were British troops. Major-General Sir William Macpherson of the RAMC wrote the official Medical History of the War (HMSO 1922)."]}, {"page": "List of NUI Galway people", "response": ["* Alfred Keogh - Director General Army Medical Services (1905-1910 and 1914-1918)"]}, {"page": "President of Imperial College London", "response": ["* 1910 Alfred Keogh"]}, {"page": "Arthur Hacker", "response": ["Hacker was the son of Edward Hacker (1812\u20131905), a line engraver specialising in animal and sporting prints (who was also for many years the registrar of Births and Deaths for the Kentish Town sub-district of Pancras Registration District, Middlesex).

They received neither pay nor special training during peacetime, though matrons underwent seven days of training in a military hospital bi-annually. By March 1909, enough nurses for 15 hospitals in England and Scotland had volunteered. Opposition from the Army Nursing Board, Sydney Holland (Chairman of the London Hospital) and senior London nurses delayed the establishment of the TFNS in the capital until the middle of March. On the 15th, 400 nurses were recruited as a result of a public meeting attended by many well-known speakers, including Elizabeth Haldane (vice-chairwoman of the Territorial Nursing Council and sister of Richard), Isla Stewart (Matron at St Bartholomew's Hospital) and Sir Alfred Keogh (Director General Army Medical Services). This was enough to establish two hospitals: No.1 (City of London) General Hospital, to be staffed exclusively by nurses from St Bartholomew's Hospital; and No.2 (City of London) General Hospital, to be staffed by nurses from the London Hospital and Guy's Hospital. Also in 1909, the TFNS was augmented by the affiliation of the Red Cross-organised Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADs). By January 1911, some 3,000 nurses had enrolled in the TFNS, and the next year the VADs numbered some 26,000 members.Beckett 2011 p. 221 In 1913, TFNS nurses were given permission to volunteer for overseas service."]}, {"page": "Keogh", "response": ["* Sir Alfred Keogh, British Army medical doctor "]}, {"page": "List of honorary graduates of the University of Leeds", "response": ["* Sir Alfred Keogh (DSc)"]}, {"page": "Almeric Paget Massage Corps", "response": ["In 1916 the work of the Corps was favourably inspected by Alfred Keogh, the Director General of the Army Medical Service.

It was decided, therefore, that Sloggett should remain the Director-General on active service abroad and Sir Alfred Keogh rejoined the services from retirement to become Director-General on the duties at home.
