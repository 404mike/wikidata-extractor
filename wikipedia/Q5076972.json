He came from a musical family, his father and brother, having been cellists and clarinettists, respectively.  In 1888, he studied with Henry Lazarus, and he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music where he continued as a student of Lazarus until the latter's retirement.  He also studied for a year under Julian Egerton.  He premiered Stanford's Clarinet Concerto in 1903 with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra.  Stanford's Clarinet Sonata was also dedicated to Draper.  Draper was also a notable teacher, teaching at the Royal College of Music, Trinity College of Music, and Guildhall School of Music & Drama, and counting Frederick Thurston among his students.  His son, Paul Beaumont Draper, was also an accomplished bassoonist.

The players did not like the music: the clarinettist, Charles Draper asked the composer, \"Mr Walton, has a clarinet player ever done you an injury?\"Kennedy, p. 33 Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton's music was used for the popular Fa\u00e7ade ballet, choreographed by Frederick Ashton.Kennedy, p. 62"]}, {"page": "Jack Brymer", "response": ["Although he had no formal tuition as a clarinettist, Brymer maintained that nobody was entirely self-taught: \"I learnt from everyone I heard play.

The ability to play the clarinet is the ability to overcome the imperfections of the instrument.
