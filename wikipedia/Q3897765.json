Miller", "response": ["At this time Stephen began what would become his lifelong focus on play and toys, and the effects of toys on the development of children and what kind of adults they become. He had recently established his unique toy store, 1 \u2022 2 \u2022 Kangaroo, located at the triangle corner of Greenwich Avenue and Seventh Avenue. This store sold unusual toys, both antique and modern. Stephen had negotiated for the exclusive American rights to import certain European toys by such distinguished designers as Lis and Kurt Naef of Naefspiele, Peer Clahsen, Fredun Shapur, Patrick Rylands, and many others. Stephen lived in an apartment at the rear of the store. During this time he was photographed in the nude by Diane Arbus. The store was patronized by artists Joseph Cornell, whose boxes contain some items he bought there, and the painter Marcel Duchamp who visited the store frequently. Stephen Miller and all three of his Greenwich Village ventures, The Hip Bagel, 1\u20222\u2022Kangaroo, and Avec were mentioned in the November 26, 1964 edition of the Village Voice."]}]}}
