Low announced a new youth policy at Vale Park, and promptly released Cyril Done (Winsford United); Ray King (sold to Boston United for \u00a32,500); Reg Potts and Stan Turner (Worcester City); Tommy Cheadle, Stan Smith, and Derek Mountford (Crewe Alexandra); Len Stephenson and Billy Spurdle (Oldham Athletic); and Harry Anders (Accrington Stanley)."]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Derek Mountford"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Derek Mountford"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season began with just one loss in the opening eleven games, including victories at Upton Park and Craven Cottage, and a 1\u20130 home win over rivals Stoke City in front of a crowd of 37,261. Nevertheless, injuries began to affect the first eleven, leaving room for reserves like Derek Mountford, Stan Smith, and Tom Conway to make an impression. The 'Steele Curtain' defence was still in operation, picking up five clean sheets in these eleven games. Journalist Bernard Jones compared 'the Vale Plan' to the Brazilian method of defence, defending the penalty area at all costs as that was from where 95% of all goals were scored. However manager Freddie Steele responded by claiming there was no such plan, and that the main objective was simply 'to beat the opposition'. On 22 October, Sheffield Wednesday went away from Vale Park with a 1\u20130 win, this was followed with a 4\u20131 defeat at Filbert Street. Steele began to initiate a modern pre-match ritual of having the players warm up in their tracksuits fifteen minutes before kick-off, though on 12 November this did them no favours at Ewood Park, as Blackburn Rovers romped to a 7\u20131 victory. Steele made eight changes following the defeat, which made little difference as Vale extended their run without a win to nine games. This left them in fifteenth place by mid-December, with a host of players out with injuries.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Derek Mountford"]}, {"page": "1956\u201357 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On the financial side, 105,000 spectators had been lost from the previous season to an average of only 14,046, leaving an income from gate receipts of \u00a340,717.

The club's debts were worrying however, causing the club's directors to funnel \u00a32,500 of their own resources towards repaying this debt.
