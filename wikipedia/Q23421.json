Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a championship winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton had to work with some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Alan Foggon||||FW||1967\u20131971||61||14||"]}, {"page": "Tyne\u2013Wear derby", "response": ["*Alan Foggon"]}, {"page": "Phil Dwyer", "response": ["On his 18th birthday, Dwyer was offered his first professional contract with the club by manager Jimmy Scoular, earning \u00a320 per week. With Cardiff struggling in the Second Division during the 1972\u201373 season, Dwyer became increasingly involved in the first team as Scoular attempted to improve the side's fortunes. On 7 October 1972, Scoular dropped David Carver from the side and handed Dwyer his professional debut against Leyton Orient. Playing as a right-back, he helped the side record a goalless draw, having been reduced to ten men when Alan Foggon had been sent off after 30 minutes. Dwyer remained in the first team for the remainder of the season and was ever present for the side in all competitions following his debut. He made 40 appearances during the season, helping the side narrowly avoid relegation with a 1\u20131 draw against Sunderland in the final match of the campaign.
