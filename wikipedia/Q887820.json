However, like the previous season, Dordrecht started the competition poorly and were in last place in mid-November. As a result, head coach G\u00e9rard de Nooijer was fired. After assistant Scott Calderwood took over as caretaker until the winter break, and subsequently left the club, Cl\u00e1udio Braga was appointed the new head coach. Dordrecht also entered into partnerships with Feyenoord and English club Norwich City. In the winter break, the squad received a quality boost with the arrival of Jo\u00ebl Zwarts, Crysencio Summerville and Jari Schuurman, among others. The latter even signed a three-year permanent contract with the Schapekoppen. Under the new coach and with a squad strengthened by new loanees, Dordrecht performed better in the second half of the season, among others beating eventual champions FC Twente. Dordrecht finished the competition in seventeenth place and started the following season with a number of new loanees on the books."]}, {"page": "Rutger Worm", "response": ["In the 2019\u201320 season, Worm was assistant to head coach Arno Arts at DFS.
