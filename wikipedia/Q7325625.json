However, after the Challenger accident this space flight was cancelled, and he left the space program without having flown into orbit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Canceled Space Shuttle missions", "response": ["*Richard Farrimond"]}, {"page": "British space programme", "response": ["Army Lieutenants-Colonel Anthony Boyle (born in Kidderminster) and Richard Farrimond (born in Birkenhead, Cheshire), MoD employee Christopher Holmes (born in London), Royal Navy Commander Peter Longhurst (born in Staines, Middlesex) and RAF Squadron Leader Nigel Wood (born in York) were selected in February 1984 as payload specialists for the Skynet 4 programme, intended for launch using the Space Shuttle.
