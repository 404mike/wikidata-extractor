It was widely regarded as one of the strongest teams to depart English shores, comparable with the great teams of Johnny Douglas in 1911-12 and Percy Chapman in 1928-29.p96, Willis and Murphy It had no obvious weaknesses, and yet it was beaten \u2013 and beaten badly. By the First Test the top batsmen had made runs, the Surrey trio of Loader, Laker and Lock had taken wickets, as had Lancashire's Brian Statham. South Australia, Victoria and an Australian XI had all been beaten \u2013 the last by the crushing margin of 345 runs \u2013 and all seemed rosy for Peter May's touring team. But in the Brisbane Test they lost by 8 wickets and the rest of the series failed to offer any hope of reversing their fortunes. The reasons for their failure were manifold; the captain was too defensive; injuries affected their best players; others were too young and inexperienced such as Arthur Milton, Raman Subba Row, Ted Dexter, Roy Swetman and John Mortimore, or at the end of their career; Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey, Jim Laker, Willie Watson and Frank Tyson. Their morale was further bruised when faced with bowlers of dubious legality and unsympathetic umpires. Peter May was criticised for seeing his fianc\u00e9e Virginia Gilligan, who was travelling with her uncle the Test Match commentator Arthur Gilligan.p86, Miller The press blamed the poor performance on the team's heavy drinking, bad behaviour and lack of pride \u2013 a foretaste the treatment losing teams would receive in the 1980s. It was not a happy tour by any means and it would take 12 years to recover The Ashes. As E.W. Swanton noted", "The great England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans was on his fourth tour of Australia, having visited before in 1946\u201347, 1950\u201351 and 1954\u201355. He was chosen in part for his batting, having made centuries against the West Indies and India, but his loud and enthusiastic wicketkeeping was a joy to watch and considered by far the best in the world.p173-174, Swanton, 1986 When he returned to England in 1959 he missed three stumpings in fifteen minutes against India and retired from Test cricket as he no longer met his own exacting standards, but his record number of dismissals in Test cricket remained unbeaten for eighteen years. The Marylebone Cricket Club preferred to rotate their reserve wicket-keepers and in 1958\u201359 it was the turn of the reserve Surrey keeper Roy Swetman. He was by far the shortest man in the team and looked only 17, but was in fact 25. Although a good man behind the stumps and a decent lower order batsman he was not Evans and lost his England place in 1960. In 1956 England had out-fielded and out-caught Australia and they were still a strong fielding team. Colin Cowdrey would be the first slip fielder to take 100 Test catches, Peter May and Tom Graveney were good slips and Ted Dexter an athletic cover. Fred Trueman was a good close field and Tony Lock was considered the greatest backward short leg in the world and one of the safest pair of hands in cricket.p204-205, Swanton, 1986 Peter Richardson, Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey were good all round fielders, though the latter two were slowing down at the end of their careers.", "*Godfrey Evans broke his middle finger and missed the Third Test, leading to Roy Swetman's unfortunate debut. When he returned for the Fourth Test it had not full healed and broke it again, but he continued to keep wicket on the second day. He was replaced on the third day by Tom Graveney, a part-time keeper for Gloucestershire, batted in both innings, but missed the Fifth Test."]}, {"page": "History of cricket in Zimbabwe to 1992", "response": ["A Commonwealth XI cricket team toured Rhodesia in the 1962\u201363 season, playing two first-class matches against teams representative of Rhodesia, in Kitwe and Salisbury (Harare).

Later Indian batsmen did better, but no one reached 30 on a bland wicket. England's new opening pair of Gilbert Parkhouse and Geoff Pullar put on 146 for the first wicket, and then Cowdrey and Barrington put on 193 for the fourth wicket, Cowdrey going on to make 160.

Taller than many wicket-keepers of the period, he seemed well-equipped to handle Worcestershire's battery of fast-medium bowlers in the late 1950s, led by Jack Flavell and Len Coldwell. But the emergence from 1960 of a more balanced bowling attack, with the arrival of first Doug Slade and then Norman Gifford, both slow left-arm, not only gave Worcestershire a Championship-winning edge but also showed Booth to be among the best all-round wicket-keepers in the country at the time. Despite his record, he appears never to have been close to Test selection, as the long-standing Godfrey Evans was succeeded as England wicketkeeper by a series of players (Roy Swetman, John Murray, Geoff Millman, Jim Parks) a few years younger than Booth."]}, {"page": "History of cricket in India from 1960\u201361 to 1970", "response": ["The International Cavaliers toured Africa and India in 1962\u201363 to promote cricket.

The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests\u2014307 at (21.57)\u2014had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace.p239, Swanton, 1986 He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket.pp289\u201399, Arnold Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller.pp76\u201377, Miller Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.p134, Miller", "Peter May won the toss for the third time in a row and again decided to bat regardless of the ill-omens as the wicket looked easy going and was expected to take spin. Stonewaller Trevor Bailey who had been promoted in the batting order from 6 to 3, then 2 and was now asked to go in first with Arthur Milton. They were both out for 8 to Ian Meckiff and Alan Davidson and England were 23/2. Once again the England opening partnership had failed and Bailey, a considerable stumbling block for the bowlers down the order had been sacrificed at the top of the order. Tom Graveney (33) and Peter May (42) restored the innings as the fast bowlers found little swing, but Benaud kept them on for over an hour and May edged a ball past Neil Harvey at slip. With the shine taken off the new ball the pacemen were taken off and the spinners brought on, Richie Benaud getting turn almost at once and appealed for leg before wicket against May, but it was turned down. Keith Slater's first Test wicket was May after he had been hit for 4 and 2 and the captain looked in fine form, Slater getting the ball to hang back and it was hit where Benaud had placed Ken Mackay in the covers a few balls before, where he took a fine catch. Graveney edged Benaud just past Harvey which he managed to take for another stunning catch and Dexter was l.b.w. offering no stroke to Slater (2/40) and England were 98/5. The debutant Roy Swetman joined Colin Cowdrey to a great ovation from the 50,000 in the stands and survived a difficult catch to Harvey and another to Colin McDonald who had replaced \"The Claw\" at leg-slip, both chances off Benaud. The young wicket-keeper used his feet to go down the wicket, so when he padded up he could not given l.b.w., and began to make some runs with Cowdrey stroking the ball through the covers. After tea the vice-captain (34) gave Harvey another catch off Benaud, but Swetman and Tony Lock saw England safely to stumps with 190/6. The next day's start was delayed to past tea because of rain, made worse by the inadequate covering of the infield. When they finally resumed Benaud was spinning the ball more than ever and declined to take the new ball. Lock was out l.b.w. to Mackay, who ended Swetman's fine innings of 41 with another great catch off Benaud. Harvey also accounted for Jim Laker when he knocked the ball up into the air on the first attempt and ran five yards to catch it. Seeing the end was near Fred Trueman scattered the close fielders with a few powerful strokes and heaved the ball into the stands, but he was caught by Burke off Benaud to give the Australian captain 5/83 and England were out for 219. The first day was watched by John Mills and Trevor Howard, who were acting in Australia at the time. Howard compared the England collapse to the final act of the play he was in, saying \"Hamlet was never like this\".p124, Millerpp117\u201322, Bedserpp122\u201326, Miller", "There was time for three overs before the end of the day, but Roy Swetman dropped Colin McDonald in the first overp7, Freddi and Fred Trueman was not best pleased, \"getting a wicket in my first over is always a great motivator, and seeing a decent chance put down annoyed me\".p221, Trueman He bowled again on the Monday morning after a long dry Sunday and Jim Burke edged another chance off Trueman which a diving Swetman just reached, but he was unable to hold onto it. The Yorkshire fast bowler also got edges off Burke in the untenanted lep-slip area and McDonald just wide of the wicket-keeper. With the wicket made for spin and the pacemen getting nowhere May brought on Jim Laker (5/107) and Tony Lock (4/130). McDonald and Burke started walking down the pitch, sometimes even before Laker delivered the ball, but Burke edged a catch to Lock at short fine-leg to end their opening partnership on 26. Laker and Lock varied their bowling with flight and changes of pace and Lock moved from bowling round to over the wicket as when he saw that he could make the ball turn. Neil Harvey was worried by Laker using the rough and was with him stranded on a front foot stroke when a ball pitched middle-and-leg took out his off stump. McDonald was still moving down the wicket when he missed only for Swetamn to fumble the stumping. Norm O'Neill decided to drive firmly and one powerful stroke went past Tom Graveney just 10 yards away who got hand to the ball, but failed to take a difficult catch. None of these chances were easy, but Australia had been able to make then stick in the England innings and it would cost the tourists as O'Neill settled down to make 77. May switched the bowlers' ends using Statham, who O'Neill edged twice through vacant second slip to the boundary, but the change produced a wicket when Graveney dived forward to take McDonald off Lock. This brought the opener Les Favell to the crease at 87/3 and after surviving several loud l.b.w. appeals began to cut the spinners to the boundary and reached 50 before stumps in an unbeaten stand of 99. Laker's arthritic bowling finger hurt so much that he couldn't sleep, but after they brought up their century stand Australia was Lakered and Locked on the Tuesday morning, Cowdrey taking a catch off Lock for Favell and Swetman off Laker for O'Neill, Benaud was bowled by Laker trying to hit him out of the ground and they were 208/6. This brought \"Slasher\" Mackay and Alan Davidson together and England needed their wickets quickly to even the first innings score. Davdison repeatedly edged the ball just off his stumps and was lucky to survive, but May kept the spinners working for an hour after the new ball was due, but with no wickets forthcoming Trueman and Statham came back into the attack. There was little life in the pitch, Swetman taking the ball about his knees, and no or little swing. The heat in Sydney reached 100\u00a0\u00b0F/38\u00a0\u00b0C and Fred Trueman was sweltering in the outfield when a man on the Hill shouted \"Fred, you look in need of a beer, mate\" and gave him a can of Fosters to the delight of the crowd. When he returned after his next over he found twenty beer cans waiting in a line in front of the boundary fence.p223, Trueman Davidson was playing a restrained innings instead of hitting the ball around the ground and Mackay foreswore his stonewalling to hit boundaries, so they ended up keeping pace with each other. May brought back his spinners and as the score passed 300/6 used Bailey for the first time, though like the others he found little swing. The seventh wicket finally came when Trueman (1/46) was back for a short spell when there were clouds about and bowled Mackay (57) with a swinging yorker on 323/7\u2014a stand of 115. Davidson was in trouble for ten minutes, but finally went leg before to Lock for 71. With the last recognised batsman dismissed on 353/8 the innings was wrapped up for 357, a lead of 139.pp122\u201331, Bedserpp126\u201330, Miller", "The Australians dropped Keith Slater and replaced him with the veteran fast bowler Ray Lindwall after an absence of 18 months. Although now 37 he had been training hard and had bowled well, having taken 7/73 against MCC. With 212 Test wickets Lindwall was the second greatest Australian wicket taker after Clarrie Grimmett (216) and he was determined to beat the record. Ian Meckiff had bruised his Achilles tendon at Sydney and was unfit to play, but any joy the England camp may have felt was reduced when they debuted the  \"Blonde Giant\" Gordon Rorke after he had taken 6/58 against Queensland and 4/57 in the recent tour match. Incidentally, Rorke was the only Australian tailender as the other ten players were First Class cricket centurions. For England, Peter Richardson returned to open the batting with Trevor Bailey because Arthur Milton had re-fractured his broken finger and Raman Subba Row still had a damaged wrist. The alternative opener was Willie Watson\u2014who replaced Ted Dexter\u2014but he had made 141 batting at number 6 against Victoria and May wanted to keep him in the lower-middle order. Peter Loader had a groin strain that had kept him out of the New South Wales game, but the great shock was that the off-spinner Jim Laker, England's best bowler, could not play because his arthritic spinning finger was immobile. As a result, Frank Tyson was recalled after two years out of the team, having had taken 3/40 and 4/55 in the last two matches. Godfrey Evans replaced Roy Swetman as wicket-keeper even though his broken middle finger had not fully mended as the young Surrey keeper had proved fallible behind the stumps. As a result, May had four fast bowlers and only one spinner on a pitch that was traditionally a good batting surface with low bounce, though the South Australia game at Christmas had seen a green, pacey wicket. This was the only Test in which the three great England fast bowlers of the 1950s Tyson, Trueman and Statham all played together. Mel McInnes was umpire again, much to the annoyance of the England team as he had made mistakes in all his matches leading up to the Fourth Test. The 1956 Australians successfully asked for the great English umpire Frank Chester to be removed when an illness made his decisions erratic.pp149\u201351, Bedserpp134\u201335, Miller", "In the 1950\u201351 Ashes series the MCC tour manager Freddie Brown arrived at Melbourne for the Fifth and final Test having lost the series 4\u20130, but won the match and won a great ovation from the Australian crowd who admired his fighting spirit throughout the series.pp78\u201380, Swanton, 1977 He now arrived with Peter May's team hoping to do the same and the players were keen to salvage something from the tour.p177, Bedser Arthur Milton was sent home with his broken finger, Brian Statham and Peter Loader had been injured in a car accident when their tyre blew, Godfrey Evans was still recovering from his broken finger and Willie Watson suffered a groin strain bowling in the nets. This reduced the touring team to 13 fit players, but Jim Laker was ready to play and returned to the team with Ted Dexter and Roy Swetman. Tony Lock's 5 wickets had cost 75.20 and was dropped in favour of debutant off-spinner John Mortimore. This was a surprise for the Australians, but even more so to Lock, who heard the news on the radio. The home team dropped batsman Les Favell in favour of the fast bowler Ian Meckiff whose bruised foot had healed. Mel McInnes was replaced as umpire by Les Townsend in his only Test as umpire.pp177\u201378, Bedserp150, Miller", "For the first time in the series Richie Benaud won the toss and took the unusual step of putting England into bat, but he had four fast bowlers in his team and wanted to use them in the humid, swinging conditions. In the second over Ray Lindwall's first ball swung away and Trevor Bailey was caught first ball by Alan Davidson in third slip to give him his 216th Test wicket and equal Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record. Just before the Test Bailey had given a talk to the inmates of HMP Pentridge and had been asked if he had ever been out first ball in a Test match. He said he had not, but retained his sense of humour as he ordered roast duck for dinner after his dismissal. Peter May fell to Meckiff and England were 13/2, but Peter Richardson made a dogged 68 by forgoing his favourate deflections through the slips which had cost his wicket so many times. He added 48 with Colin Cowdrey (22) and 48 again with Tom Graveney (19), taking the score to 109/3. Tom Graveney was dismissed by Benaud; \"I remember him getting me out in the 1958\u201359 Melbourne Test by attacking my leg stump. He bowled me two half-volleys, the first of which I drove hard to Colin McDonald at mid-on. The second was just a fraction slower, and I was committed to the stroke before I spotted it. McDonald held the catch and the critics put it down to another casual shot from Graveney. They did not seem to notice the crafty part that Benaud had played in my dismissal\".pp68\u201369, Graveney Ted Dexter was out first ball to Meckiff (2/57), Roy Swetman for 1 off Davidson and Richardson was caught and bowled by Benaud to leave England 128/7. Debutant John Mortimore showed his all round skills with an unbeaten 44, adding 63 with Fred Trueman (21) before Benaud (4/43) and Davidson (3/38) finished off the innings for 205 early on the second day.pp178\u201382, Bedserp151, Miller", "The pitch still had some life when Fred Trueman and Frank Tyson opened the bowling, and Trueman was able to swing the ball. When Colin McDonald was on 12 he found one of his bails had fallen off his stumps, but an appeal for hit wicket was disallowed, though McDonald later thought that he must have hit the stumps when starting for a run. He also gave a catch to John Mortimore at short-leg, but the fieldman slipped on the wet ground and missed it. Jim Burke showed a marked dislike to the short-pitched bowling and both bowlers exploited this until he lobbed a catch to Trueman off a Tyson bouncer. Jim Laker had a temperature and sore throat, but came on to bowl with Mortimore, but neither off-spinner could get the ball to turn like Benaud's wrist spin, which usually had an advantage in Australia. McDonald was now comfortable and was using his favourite cut stroke to make runs, but Neil Harvey was not comfortable against the faster bowling and Trueman had him caught by Roy Swetman off a beautiful out-swinger. Norm O'Neill came in to bat and on \"a good day for batting and with an appreciative crowd in attendance I felt like a million\", but was caught by Colin Cowdrey in the gully off Fred Trueman for a first ball duck. Four years later in the Second Test on the same ground he was dismissed in exactly the same manner for another first ball duck.p95, Freddi This left Australia 83/3, but McDonald (133) added 71 with Ken Mackay (23) and 53 with Alan Davidson (17), who was bowled for Mortimore's first Test wicket. McDonald fell to Laker (4/92) at 209/6 and England were still in the game. \"Slasher\" Mackay batted for two hours to reach 22 and was given a slow hand clap by the impatient crowd of 50,000. Richie Benaud (64) and Wally Grout (74, his highest Test score) hastened the scoring rate, made 115 and for the only time in the series a hundred runs was made in a session as they hooked away at the bowlers feeding them short balls. Laker got them both out in the end and Trueman was given the new ball as Ray Lindwall came to the crease. In 1953 Lindwall had hit Trueman with a wicked bouncer that \"hit me so hard in the shoulder blade that I thought someone had stuck a carving knife in it\".p141, Trueman Trueman had sworn revenge, but had had to wait for five years. He got Lindwall out with a ball that ricocheted off his bat handle onto his forehead into the hands of Colin Cowdrey at slip.p99, Freddi The Yorkshireman caught and bowled Meckiff and Swetman caught Benaud off Laker to finish the innings on 351, 146 runs ahead.p182, Bedserpp154\u201355, Miller"]}, {"page": "MCC tour of Australia in 1958\u201359", "response": ["Until the 1970s it was the practice to strengthen state sides with Test cricketers so that the Australian selectors could see them play and to provide more games for the tourists. Colin McDonald of Victoria, Norm O'Neill of New South Wales, Ken Mackay of Queensland were flown over and such was O'Neill's popularity that a record 17,921 people came to watch him bat on the second day, the biggest crowd at the WACA since 1932. Keith Miller wrote \"Not since the days of Bradman had one player so absorbed the limelight\".p77, Miller Willie Watson was having knee surgery, Frank Tyson had lumbago and Roy Swetman, Tom Graveney and Tony Lock were dropped so that the other 11 players could have a game. The MCC won the toss and chose to bat on a wicket that had been dried out by a week's sunshine since their last game. Peter Richardson and Arthur Milton were out playing strokes, unused to the pace and bounce of Australian wickets, Raman Subba Row was unlucky and the tourists were soon 33/3. As many times before it was up to captain Peter May and vice-captain Colin Cowdrey to set things right after a shaky start and they had added 134 runs when May pulled a knee ligament and retired hurt on 68. Cowdrey played carefully for 78 and when Trevor Bailey was yorked by Raymond Strauss (5/99) May returned, using Bailey as a runner. He added 92 with Evans (55) and made 113 when they both got themselves out to allow the tail wag its way to 349. With May and Bailey unwell Cowdrey brought Jim Laker (2/55) in to float the ball into a strong wind once Brian Statham (2/35) finished his opening spell. O'Neill came in after the first wicket and batted wonderfully, hitting Milton for 23 off an over and making 104 on the Monday morning despite Ken Mackay making him wait for an hour by taking a single off the last ball of six overs in succession. Only 110 runs were made in the day as Laker bowled very tightly and removed O'Neill. Peter Loader (4/56) ran through the lower order as the Combined XI fell from 187/3 to 227/8 and 260 all out. Richardson failed again and the wicketless Fred Trueman went in as nightwatchman to hit 53 before Bailey (71 not out) and Cowdrey (100 not out) batted out the day to draw the game on 257/4.p22-29, Bedser", "The next stop was in Sydney to play the champions New South Wales. Ian Craig was captain of Australia as well as New South Wales, which had won the Sheffield Shield 8 times since the war, the last 4 in succession, and would go on to win another 5. On a wicket known to take spin Jim Laker was unfit to play, as was Peter Loader, Willie Watson, still recovering from his knee surgery, Fred Trueman had a cold, but volunteered to play and Peter May had recovered sufficiently to captain the team. Craig won the toss and batted on a sunny day on a good wicket. After Sid Carroll was bowled by a Trueman outswinger in the first over Jim Burke made a ponderous 104 and Neil Harvey a somewhat quicker 149 to finish the day on 243/1. Taking the new ball the next day Trueman (2/62) had Harvey caught off a skyer, which brought in Norm O'Neill, who stroked his way to 84 not out. The other batsman went for runs and Lock (4/121) picked up the wickets of Burke, Craig (who looked very unwell) and Brian Booth for ducks and Alan Davidson for 8. Richie Benaud was caught and bowled off a Trevor Bailey long-hop and Craig declared on 391/7 before O'Neill could complete his century. The MCC openers were soon out; Arthur Milton (10) bowled by the huge Gordon Rorke (1/15) and Peter Richardson (21), caught by Harvey off Peter Philpott. Peter May (29) and Tom Graveney (36) saw out the second day, but the next highest scorer was last man Brian Statham with 27 as the New South Wales leg-spinners Richie Benaud (5/48) and Philpott (4/87) worked their way through the order, leaving \"Barnacle Bailey\" on 14 not out in a total of 177. The improvement of Benaud's bowling since his great tour of South Africa was evident just two weeks before the first Test. Craig enforced the follow on, but the MCC recovered as Richardson (87) and Milton (81) put on 170 for the first wicket, easily their best effort of the tour. Philpott took 5 catches in the match and removed both openers, one off Davidson (2/37) and the other off Benaud (2/84) and the MCC slumped to 217/4. Tom Graveney (59), Roy Swetman (52) and Colin Cowdrey (42 not out) played out the last day and the tourists ended on a comfortable 356/4. Strangely Swetman, using his feet more than the other batsman, played the spinners better than the other batsmen, who were struggling. After the match the MCC announced that John Mortimore would be sent out to reinforce the team as it appeared that the pitches would take spin. He was also an all-rounder who could strengthen the lower order batting and his arrival would allow the team to rest Laker and Lock in the state games.p45-50, Bedser", "Travelling north to Brisbane the tourists found a storm brewing and the weather cool, but heavy. Peter May won the toss and chose to bat on a green wicket, but only three overs were played before the rain came. When they resumed the opener Willie Watson was caught by Wally Grout off the Queensland captain Ray Lindwall, who swung the ball at his pleasure in the heavy atmosphere, taking 5/57 as England collapsed to 39/4. Raman Subba Row (51) and Trevor Bailey (33) rescued the innings, but the leg-spinner Wal Walmsley (2/34) bowled Subba Row and Ken Mackay (3/4) removed Roy Swetman and Frank Tyson and the MCC were out for 151. Queensland were 30/1 overnight and batted poorly the next day, making only 105 runs in a full day's play as John Mortimore took 21-8-26-0 in the day, Jim Laker 12-3-19-1 and Trevor Bailey 21-8-28-1. No wonder crowds flocked to see Norm O'Neill's attacking strokeplay. On the last day Queensland made an effort to make more runs, but still took 501 minutes to make 210 with Statham taking 3/43 and Laker 4/27, but Mortimore was hit for 38 runs off his last 8 overs without a wicket and Ron Archer top scored with 83. The ball broke Raman Subba Row's wrist when fielding, another injury that removed him from contention just after he had made three fifties in three games. The MCC collapsed again to 41/4 as Lindwall (2/16) removed both openers and Walmsley (2/25) the out of form Colin Cowdrey and Trevor Bailey. Peter May and Roy Swetman added 30 unbeaten runs when the rain returned to finish the game.57-60, Bedser", "The MCC returned to Adelaide to play South Australia and were put in on Christmas Eve by Les Favell on a lively wicket freshened up by the rain that delayed the start. The old Australian fast bowler Tim Wall could hardly believe his eyes as the ball leapt up at the batsmen where normally it rarely rose above the stumps. Richardson, Watson, Cowdrey (the captain for this match) and Dexter were out for 34/4 to the long drag of Peter Trethewey (1/33) and Alan Hitchcox (3/48). Arthur Milton stuck in for 37, was hit repeatedly by the ball, broke his finger and Tom Graveney made 54. Tony Lock added 43 before he was out to a juggled caught and bowled by Leon Hill (2/55), which the umpire thought he had under control. Christmas Day was a rest day, but the MCC resumed on 180/7 on Boxing Day, and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman impressed with 41, having made several useful innings on the tour. Fred Trueman belted 39 and John Mortimore 17 of the last 20 runs when they were out for 276. With the wicket drying and better for batting Ted Dexter (2/45) had removed the openers Les Favell and Gavin Stevens after Frank Tyson left the field because of stomach trouble. They started the third day on 110/3, but John Lill (86) was the only man to pass 30 as \"Fiery Fred\" Trueman took 5/46 and they were out for 223. Wickets continue to tumble with the 19-year-old Brian Hurn taking 5/62 with Willie Watson holding the fort with 40, but the tourists were 110/7 at the end of the Saturday. With Sunday providing a second rest day Swetman (76) returned before a crowd of 12,000 to raise the total to 195/9 batting as if in a charity match. Cowdrey declared when he was out to leave South Australia 249 runs to win in 195 minutes. The started well with Les Favell (52) and David Harris (30) taking the score to 78/1 after Tyson and Swetman ran out Stevens for a duck, but collapsed to Trueman (4/33), who reduced them to 102/6, and the spinners Lock, Mortimore and Graveney ran through the overs to leave South Australia 138/9 at stumps.p91-95, Bedser", "Peter May rejoined the team when they came back to Sydney to replay New South Wales, by far the strongest state side and the match was almost played at Test level. New South Wales were sent in to bat by May on a humid day with the ball swinging and patches on the wicket thanks to poor covering against the recent rain. Frank Tyson (4/55) and Brian Statham (4/36), the new ball partnership of 1954\u201355, showed that they could still be very dangerous. Roy Swetman dropped Watson in the first over from Tyson, but caught him off Statham for a duck. Norm O'Neill was hit on the elbow by a rising Tyson delivery and retired hurt on 37/2. Neil Harvey made another 92 and fought back with fellow left-hander Neil Marks (42) as they took the score past 150 without further loss, but Tyson came off a short run at fast-medium pace and removed Harvey, Marks, Grahame Thomas and Richie Benaud as they crashed to 171/6 before stumps. O'Neill returned at the start of the new day, but was l.b.w. to Trevor Bailey (2/40) and Statham removed the tail and New South Wales were out for 215. Gordon Rorke (4/57) removed Peter Richardson l.b.w. first ball and Tom Graveney for 14 and generated great pace off his short run, but his long drag left him only 19 yards from the batsman when he bowled and he was very difficult to play. Trevor Bailey was hit repeatedly by Rorke, but stuck in for 54 and Peter May made a powerful 136 as they added 179 for the third wicket. The captain saw off Rorke and attacked the spinners, hitting the New South Wales captain Richie Benaud for six over mid-on and cracking drives through the covers with such ferocity that four fielders could not stop him hitting the boundary. May was 99 not out on the Saturday evening and returned on the Monday, but without the same certainty. Bailey went down the pitch to Jim Burke (1/30), missed and was stumped miles out of his ground, but the crowd shouted that Burke ought to be given a coconut because he shied the ball. Rorke caught May (136) with a beautiful ball that swung from leg to hit off stump and had Willie Watson leg before, then Benaud (5/83) spun through the tail to give him 50 wickets in the season and the MCC were out for 303. There was just time for New South Wales to reach 44/0 when the rain washed out the third and fourth days.p144-148, Bedser"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Roy Swetman (1972\u20131974) : R.
