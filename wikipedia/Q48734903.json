He became known for his independent reporting during British rule in India, and in particular for his decision to publish graphic photographs, in August 1943, of the Bengal famine of 1943, which claimed between 1.5 and 3 million lives. The publication of the images, along with Stephens' editorials, helped to bring the famine to an end by persuading the British government to supply adequate relief to the victims.When Stephens died, Amartya Sen wrote in a letter to The Times: \"In the subcontinent in which Ian Stephens spent a substantial part of his life, he is remembered not only as a great editor (with amiable, if somewhat eccentric, manners), but also as someone whose hard-fought campaign possibly saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Statesman (India)", "response": ["The Statesman is characterized by its terse reporting style. It holds an Centre-Right position. It opposed the shifting of India's capital from Calcutta to New Delhi in 1911, stating that \"[t]he British have gone to the city of graveyards to be buried there\".  It also strenuously opposed Indira Gandhi's Emergency in 1975\u201377. Under the editor Ian Stephens (who was editor from 1942 to 1951), the newspaper published highly disturbing images, on 22 and 29 August 1943, of the effects of the Bengal famine of 1943, despite the British colonial government's attempts at censorship. The images played a major role in changing world opinion on imperialism."]}, {"page": "Bengal famine of 1943", "response": ["Beginning in mid-July 1943 and more so in August, however, these two newspapers began publishing detailed and increasingly critical accounts of the depth and scope of the famine, its impact on society, and the nature of British, Hindu, and Muslim political responses. A turning point in news coverage came in late August 1943, when the editor of The Statesman, Ian Stephens, solicited and published a series of graphic photos of the victims. These made world headlines and marked the beginning of domestic and international consciousness of the famine. The next morning, \"in Delhi second-hand copies of the paper were selling at several times the news-stand price,\" and soon \"in Washington the State Department circulated them among policy makers\". In Britain, The Guardian called the situation \"horrible beyond description\". The images had a profound effect and marked \"for many, the beginning of the end of colonial rule\". Stephens' decision to publish them and to adopt a defiant editorial stance won accolades from many (including the Famine Inquiry Commission), and has been described as \"a singular act of journalistic courage without which many more lives would have surely been lost\". The publication of the images, along with Stephens' editorials, not only helped to bring the famine to an end by driving the British government to supply adequate relief to the victims, but also inspired Amartya Sen's influential contention that the presence of a free press prevents famines in democratic countries. The photographs also spurred Amrita Bazar Patrika and the Indian Communist Party's organ, People's War, to publish similar images; the latter would make photographer Sunil Janah famous. Women journalists who covered the famine included Freda Bedi reporting for Lahore's The Tribune, and Vasudha Chakravarti and Kalyani Bhattacharjee, who wrote from a nationalist perspective."]}, {"page": "Ravindra Kumar (editor)", "response": ["*Ian Stephens (editor)"]}, {"page": "Ian Stephens", "response": ["Ian Stephens or Ian Stevens may refer to:", "* Ian Stephens (artist) (active since 1971), Australian artist", "* Ian Stephens (editor) (1903\u20131984), editor of The Statesman, Kolkata, India", "* Ian Stephens (poet) (1955\u20131996), Canadian poet, journalist and musician", "* Ian Stephens (rugby union) (born 1952), former Wales international rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Ian Melville Stephens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Stephens (editor)"]}, {"page": "Media coverage of the 1943 Bengal famine", "response": ["A turning point in news coverage came in late August 1943, when the editor of The Statesman,  Ian Stephens, had a series of graphic photographs of the victims taken, some of which he published on 22 and 29 August.
