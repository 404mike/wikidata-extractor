This circuit became the basis of electronic memory in computers.\nFrank Wilfred Jordan was born on 6 October 1881 in Canterbury, Kent, England, the son of Edward James Jordan and Eliza Edith King. He married Fanny Bentley Wood, a florist, in Canterbury, when based in Newhaven as a soldier on 7 December 1916. He died on 12 January 1941 in Coltham, Gretton Road, Winchcomb, Gloucestershire, England, aged 59.\nInformation including date and place of birth, marriage and death are confirmed in Certificates from the General Register Office.  Jordan received his secondary education at the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury, Kent, England.  From 1899 to 1904, he was a student at the Royal College of Science, from which he graduated with an Associateship in physics and a master of science degree. In 1912 he was a \"lecturer in physics\",  presumably at the Royal College of Science.  In 1918 he was an \"electrician\" at City and Guilds Technical College. There is little else known about him.\nThis flip-flop circuit became perhaps the most important circuits in computer technology, allowing binary data to be stored.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeline of computing hardware before 1950", "response": ["|| William Henry Eccles and F.
