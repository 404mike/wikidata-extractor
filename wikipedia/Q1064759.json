Thompson, writing in The New Bible Commentary, first published in 1953, state that \"The idea is not that of conciliation of an angry God by sinful humanity, but of expiation of sin by a merciful God through the atoning death of His Son. It does not necessarily exclude, however, the reality of righteous wrath because of sin.\"Davidson, F. and G. T. Thompson (1953,1954). \"Romans\", The New Bible Commentary.

This conclusion was reaffirmed in the early twentieth century by the work of scholars like C. H. Dodd.In his ; see .

For this argument, they prefer translations that render the verse as \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God,\" and they interpret this to mean that the whole Bible must therefore be inerrant. However, critics of this doctrine think that the Bible makes no direct claim to be inerrant or infallible. C. H.

H. Dodd, some scholars have maintained that the epistle and the gospel were written by different authors. There are at least two principal arguments for this view. The first is that the epistle often uses a demonstrative pronoun at the beginning of a sentence, then a particle or conjunction, followed by an explanation or definition of the demonstrative at the end of the sentence, a stylistic technique which is not used in the gospel.Wilder 1957, p. 211 The second is that the author of the epistle, \"uses the conditional sentence in a variety of rhetorical figures which are unknown to the gospel.\"C.
