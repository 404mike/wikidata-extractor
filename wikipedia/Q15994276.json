The organising committee (Brian Ansell, Tim Hawthorne, George Lunt, and Herman S. Bachelard) were all members of the Neurochemical Group of the British Biochemical Society. The working party had requested that the meeting should have a clinical theme, so the general area of \"Basic Aspects of Neurochemistry Related to the Epilepsies\" was chosen.
