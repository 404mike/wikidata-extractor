His first two seasons at Chester saw him make 20 appearances; during the 2002\u201303 season he went on loan to non-league side Vauxhall Motors. Following his return to Chester, Collins became a regular in the side and produced some fine performances which attracted the attention of Sunderland who bought him for \u00a3140,000. Collins spent five years in the North East making over 150 appearances and earning two promotions to the Premier League during that time. In August 2009 Collins joined Stoke City for \u00a32.75 million and played at left back for the \"Potters\". After losing his place in the squad he joined Ipswich Town on loan in September 2011 and then West Ham United in March 2012. He signed for Nottingham Forest in July 2012 before having a short stint with Rotherham United from 2015 to 2016.

Ferdinand made a promising start to his Sunderland career in a partnership formed with Danny Collins but Sunderland's poor results at the start of the 2008\u201309 season saw Keane experiment with several different back four line-ups resulting in Ferdinand being in and out of the side. Following captain Dean Whitehead's departure to Stoke City in July 2009, Nyron Nosworthy took Whitehead's vacated number 6 jersey and Ferdinand switched from number 26 to number 5. Ferdinand fell out of favour with new manager Steve Bruce and first team opportunities became limited and he was not initially given a squad number for the 2010\u201311 Premier League season as loan-signing John Mensah was given Ferdinand's number 5 shirt, but was later given number 29."]}, {"page": "Matthew Etherington", "response": ["On 8 January 2009, Etherington completed a transfer, thought to be for \u00a32\u00a0million, from West Ham United to Stoke City, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract.Etherington completes Stoke move He made his debut for Stoke two days after his transfer, against Liverpool in the Premier League, in a match which finished goalless.
