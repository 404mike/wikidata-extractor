In Germany, Austria and France, the work of the \"free law\" theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, Hermann Kantorowicz, Eugen Ehrlich and Francois Geny) encouraged the use of sociological insights in the development of legal and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy for a \"sociological jurisprudence\" occurred in the United States, where, throughout the first half of the twentieth century, Roscoe Pound, for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy. In the United States, many later writers followed Pound's lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, Julius Stone strongly defended and developed Pound's ideas.  In the 1930s, a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century, sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy; but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of legal philosophy in English-speaking countries in the present century, it has attracted renewed interest. Increasingly, its contemporary focus is on providing theoretical resources for jurists to aid their understanding of new types of regulation (for example, the diverse kinds of developing transnational law) and the increasingly important interrelations of law and culture, especially in multicultural Western societies.For full discussion see Cotterrell 2018"]}, {"page": "West Bank", "response": ["The international consensus is that all Israeli settlements on the West Bank beyond the Green Line are illegal under international law.'Plia Albeck, legal adviser to the Israeli Government was born in 1937.

Significant portions of the Israeli public similarly oppose the continuing presence of Jewish Israelis in the West Bank and have supported the 2005 settlement relocation. The majority of legal scholars also hold the settlements to violate international law, however individuals including Julius Stone, and Eugene Rostow have argued that they are legal under international law. Immediately after the 1967 war Theodor Meron, legal counsel of Israel's Foreign Ministry advised Israeli ministers in a \"top secret\" memo that any policy of building settlements across occupied territories violated international law and would \"contravene the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention\".Gorenberg, Gershom. \"The Accidental Empire\".

Its methods include descriptive investigations of particular legal orders. Peter Curzon wrote that this approach \"utilizes in its investigations the inductive method\" which proceeds \"from observation of particular facts to generalizations concerning all such facts.\" These investigations eschew assessments of ethics, social welfare, and morality. As Julius Stone wrote, legal positivist investigation is concerned primarily with \"an analysis of legal terms, and an inquiry into the logical interrelations of legal propositions.\" Further, law and its authority are framed as source-based: the validity of a legal norm depends not on its moral value, but on the sources determined by a social community's rules and conventions. This source-based conception aligns with the logical positivism of Rudolf Carnap, who rejected metaphysical conjecture about the nature of reality beyond observable events."]}, {"page": "Isaac Isaacs", "response": ["Isaacs was 81 when his term ended in 1936, but his public life was far from over.
