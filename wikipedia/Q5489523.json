He played as an inside forward.\nSharp was born in Tintwistle, which was then part of Cheshire. He worked in a steelworks and played football part-time for Barton BSC and for Mossley before turning professional with Birmingham in 1922. He made his debut in the First Division on 6 September 1922, deputising for Jackie Whitehouse in an away game against Newcastle United which finished goalless. He kept his place until Whitehouse regained fitness, but did not play again; a creative player, he was uncomfortable with a more attacking role. He moved on to Chesterfield of the Third Division North in 1923, for whom he scored seven goals in 22 league appearances. He then returned to non-league football with Stourbridge, Stalybridge Celtic, and a second spell with Mossley; over his Mossley career he scored 28 goals in 60 appearances.", "link_mentions": {}}}
