Westley also gave first team opportunities to players who had progressed through the club's youth system, which included George Boyd. The new squad lost five games of the opening eight games of the club's league season. Following a 4\u20131 home defeat to  part-time Canvey Island, with Stevenage supporters calling for Westley to leave the club, he walked across the pitch to  the East Terrace and told supporters he \"would turn it around\". The team responded with four consecutive victories, and stayed close to the play-offs places. Stevenage went into the final day of the season needing to beat already-relegated Leigh RMI, and had to rely on Tamworth to hold Morecambe, who were currently occupying the final play-off spot. Stevenage beat Leigh 2\u20130, while Tamworth held Morecambe to a goalless draw, ultimately meaning Westley's team had reached the play-offs on the final day of the season.

In December 2004, Lincoln City signed Hanlon on a one-month loan deal, after being transfer listed by Stevenage manager, Graham Westley. His move was made permanent days later.
