(1922\u20131980)", "response": ["By late February 1960, York were 12th in the Third Division. After one season, in which the team won only 2 of their last 14 matches, they were relegated from the Third Division in 21st place. Bartram was released from his contract in July 1960 and was replaced by Lockie. His team started 1960\u201361 well, and were fourth by mid November 1960. York endured five successive defeats before a winning run in the New Year revived their promotion hopes. They finished the season in fifth place, having won only one of their last seven matches. Throughout 1961\u201362, York were in or around the top four places, but missed out on promotion after losing 1\u20130 to Aldershot in the last match, finishing in sixth place. That season, York enjoyed their best run in the newly instituted League Cup. In this competition, they beat First Division team Leicester City, but were eliminated after a 2\u20131 defeat to divisional rivals Rochdale at Spotland Stadium in the fifth round. York made a poor start to 1962\u201363 and were second from bottom by late December 1962. Their form improved from March 1963 and they finished the season 14th. Club historian David Batters described the 1963\u201364 season as \"one of the worst in the club's history\". York spent most of the season in the bottom four before finishing 22nd, having to apply for re-election for the second time. This application was successful, as the club polled the maximum 48 votes. During this season, a match-fixing scandal exposed by the newspaper Sunday People accused York player Jack Fountain of fixing match results. His contract was terminated and he was found guilty of fixing two matches York lost."]}]}}
