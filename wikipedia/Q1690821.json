Joanna Richardson found it \"solid and imaginative\", Maurice Larkin described it as \"stimulating and unpretentious\" and John Horne praised its \"admirable subtlety\". For G. M. Hamburg the book had captured Vichy France in all of its complexity: \"Kedward\u2019s study of French idealism and opportunism gives a more complicated, but a more accurate picture of the motivations behind the resistance than is available in other histories\". Critics particularly enjoyed Kedward's linking of the history of the distant and recent past. M. R. D. Foot underlined that: \"Mr Kedward\u2019s great advantage when he writes about politics is that he understands history. One of his book\u2019s main virtues is that he shows how much people of southern France in those years of defeat and despair were conscious of, and sustained by, the knowledge of previous national catastrophes and of the traditional remedies for them.\" "]}, {"page": "Joanne Richardson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joanna Richardson"]}]}}
