He was chief editor of Burke's Peerage/Burke's Landed Gentry from 1971 to 1983.\nSometimes called the father of the modern obituary, Massingberd was most revered for his work as obituaries editor for The Daily Telegraph of London from 1986 to 1994, during which time he drastically altered the style of the modern British obituary from a dry recital of biographical data to an often sly, witty, yet deadpan narrative on the deceased person's life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Niven", "response": ["Literary editor and biographer, Graham Lord, wrote in Niv: The Authorised Biography of David Niven, that Comyn-Platt and Niven's mother may have been in an affair well before her husband's death in 1915 and that Comyn-Platt was actually Niven's biological father, a supposition that had some support among Niven's siblings. In a review of Lord's book, Hugh Massingberd from The Spectator stated photographic evidence did show a strong physical resemblance between Niven and Comyn-Platt that \"would appear to confirm these theories, though photographs can often be misleading.\" Niven is said to have revealed that he knew Comyn-Platt was his real father a year before his own death in 1983."]}, {"page": "Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon", "response": ["His obituary by Hugh Massingberd described him as a \"most uncompromisingly direct ladies' man\".\"My Mentor: Andrew McKie On Hugh Massingberd \", The Independent, 23 January 2006"]}, {"page": "Burke's Peerage", "response": ["More recent editions have been more scrupulously checked and rewritten for accuracy, notably under the chief editorship, from 1949 to 1959, of L.

They had no children. In October 1926, his wife inherited Massingberd family estates, and he changed his name by Royal Licence to add her name to his own. Thus, references to him as \"Montgomery-Massingberd\" during the First World War are anachronistic.

Pininski's 2002 book suggested that Jules-Hercule, Prince de Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9 and Duke of Montbazon, elder brother of Ferdinand de Rohan (and aide-de-camp to Henry Stuart in 1745) recognised Charlotte's offspring as his own \u2013 thus giving her status in that tight family, and claimed that in 1793, at the outbreak of the French revolution, Victoire Adelaide de Rohan went to relatives in Poland and there met and married Paul Anthony Louis Bertrand de Nikorowicz, a Polish nobleman and son of a banker. They had a son, Antime, who was the father of Charles and a daughter, Julia-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, who married Count Leonard Pininski and became Peter Pininski's great-great-grandmother. Pininski's evidence for his thesis has been described as \"often indirect, if not elliptical\"; the Rohans were a large family, and it is easy to confuse its many members. A former chairman of the Royal Stuart Society, however, stated that Pininski's evidence seemed \"genuine\", and peerage editor Hugh Massingberd described it as \"painstakingly researched\u00a0... proof to surely the most sceptical pedant's satisfaction\"."]}]}}
