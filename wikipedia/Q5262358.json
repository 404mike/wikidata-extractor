In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes to be imposed by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing \u00a380\u00a0million. In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received a high level of support, action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal. Negotiations failed to stop strike action in March, BA withdrew perks for strike participants. Allegations were made by The Guardian newspaper that BA had consulted outside firms methods to undermine the unions: the story was later withdrawn. A strike was announced for May 2010, British Airways again sought an injunction. Members of the Socialist Workers Party disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action. Further disruption struck when Derek Simpson, a Unite co-leader, was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter. Industrial action re-emerged in 2017, this time by BA's Mixed Fleet flight attendants, whom were employed on much less favorable pay and terms and conditions compared to previous cabin staff who joined prior to 2010. A ballot for industrial action was distributed to Mixed Fleet crew in November 2016 and resulted in an overwhelming yes majority for industrial action. Unite described Mixed Fleet crew as on \"poverty pay\", with many Mixed Fleet flight attendants sleeping in their cars in between shifts because they cannot afford the fuel to drive home, or operating while sick as they cannot afford to call in sick and lose their pay for the shift. Unite also blasted BA of removing staff travel concessions, bonus payments and other benefits to all cabin crew who undertook industrial action, as well as strike-breaking tactics such as wet-leasing aircraft from other airlines and offering financial incentives for cabin crew not to strike. The first dates of strikes during Christmas 2016 were cancelled due to pay negotiations. Industrial action by Mixed Fleet commenced in January 2017 after rejecting a pay offer. Strike action continued throughout 2017 in numerous discontinuous periods, resulting in one of the longest running disputes in aviation history. On 31 October 2017, after 85 days of discontinuous industrial action, Mixed Fleet accepted a new pay deal from BA which ended the dispute."]}, {"page": "Derek Simpson", "response": ["Derek Simpson may refer to:", "*Derek Simpson (cellist) (1928\u20132007), English cellist", "*Derek Simpson (trade unionist) (born 1944), British trade union leader"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Derek Simpson, trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Marx Memorial Library", "response": ["The Library now also houses \"The Printers Collection\" consisting of the archives of the printing and papermaking unions of the UK and Ireland.

Amicus's other Joint General Secretary was Derek Simpson, who was responsible for the AEEU section. Lyons planned to remain as JGS of the MSF section until 2007, which would result in his being a General Secretary for seven years without re-election, as opposed to the normal legally mandated limit of five years. He and his supporters maintained that the requirement for an election was waived because he was within 5 years of retirement, but a legal challenge resulted in a ruling in May 2004 that he should \"cease forthwith to hold office as Joint General Secretary of Amicus\". Lyons was therefore forced to leave over two years earlier than he had originally intended.
