He was England's youngest player ever to gain an international chess rating (2020 at the age of nine).\nHaving just passed his tenth birthday, he played against the then world champion Garry Kasparov in a simultaneous exhibition. Impressed by the strategic understanding of the youngster, Kasparov singled out the game as the best of that day.Murugan continued to improve rapidly, reaching 2269 Elo on FIDE's published rating list before age twelve. Thereafter, he played only infrequently and by 2003 was no longer participating in FIDE rated events.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess players", "response": ["* Murugan Thiruchelvam (England, born 1988)"]}, {"page": "List of Tamil people", "response": ["* Murugan Thiruchelvam, chess player from United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "List of Sri Lankan Tamils", "response": ["* Murugan Thiruchelvam - British child prodigy chess player"]}, {"page": "1989 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Murugan Thiruchelvam, chess player"]}, {"page": "List of British Sri Lankans", "response": ["* Murugan Thiruchelvam"]}]}}
