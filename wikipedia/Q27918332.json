Ryan was often criticized by her fellow Methodists because of her three 'marriages'. Despite her tarnished reputation, Ryan was very active in the Methodist Church. Notably, Ryan co-founded a Methodist orphanage/school named The Cedars with Mary Bosanquet Fletcher. Ryan's work at The Cedars was highly praised by John Wesley, the co-founder of Methodism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sarah Ryan", "response": ["As of May 2009 Sarah Ryan started working for the YMCA of Sydney at Mount Annan Leisure Centre as a Learn-to-swim teacher and swim coach."]}, {"page": "Mary Bosanquet Fletcher", "response": ["In 1757, Bosanquet met Sarah Crosby, who at the time was a Methodist class leader. Meeting Crosby was the final impetus behind Bosanquet's conversion to Methodism. She then dedicated her life to the Church and charity, rejecting her wealth and becoming active in the Foundery Society. She began to visit Sarah Crosby and Sarah Ryan in the Moorfields to learn more about the religion.", "By 1760, tensions between Bosanquet and her family had become pronounced. Bosanquet rejected a marriage proposal from a rich young man, which angered her parents. Instead, she told them, she wanted to devote her life to serving God. This, along with her rejection of wealth and her parents' fear that she would convert her brothers to Methodism, led her family to ask her to leave. She moved into unfurnished accommodation in Hoxton Square, where she soon settled in company with Sarah Ryan.", "Bosanquet had something of a change of heart over her wealth in 1763; she decided to accept it, but use it for charitable purposes. On 24 March 1763, Bosanquet and Sarah Ryan moved to one of the Bosanquet family's properties, nicknamed The Cedars, in Leytonstone. She and Ryan felt they were called upon by God to help others. They hoped to establish an orphanage/school modelled on John Wesley's Kingswood School. Ryan had worked at Kingswood, and so provided the expertise Bosanquet needed in order to set up a similar school. They hired a maid, and took in Ryan's orphaned niece, Sarah \"Sally\" Lawrence. As they took in more residents and Ryan's health declined, they hired Ann Tripp as a governess. Over time, other Methodist women joined Bosanquet and Ryan in their efforts, including Sarah Crosby and Mary Clark.", "===Friendship with Sarah Ryan===", "While working together at The Cedars, Bosanquet and Sarah Ryan became quite close, Ryan being like a mother to her. John Wesley acknowledged their bond, calling them, \"twin souls\". After Ryan's death in 1768, Bosanquet fell into a depression, her only consolation being dreams she had of Ryan's survival. Bosanquet's bond with Ryan was so strong that John Fletcher acknowledged Ryan as a part of their partnership during his marriage with Bosanquet."]}, {"page": "Sarah Crosby", "response": ["Crosby met Mary Bosanquet in May 1757, and the two became lifelong friends. During the summer of 1758 Crosby moved to the Moorfields, to live with Bosanquet, Sarah Ryan, and Mary Clark, all of whom would become prominent female figures in Methodism. They worked together to assist the poor and disabled.", "In 1763, she began working and living with Mary Bosanquet and Sarah Ryan at their orphanage, The Cedars, in Leytonstone. The Cedars was modelled after the Kingswood School, an institution founded by John Wesley.", "On 24 October 1804, at the age of 75, Sarah Crosby died in Leeds. She was buried in a shared grave at Leeds Parish Churchyard with her colleagues Sarah Ryan, and later, Ann Tripp.", "* Sarah Ryan (Methodist)"]}]}}
