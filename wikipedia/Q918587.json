Taylor (1893) and Stefan Drzewiecki to determine the behavior of propellers. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces on each of these small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one rotor revolution in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the induced velocity on the rotor disk. Because of this the blade element theory is often combined with momentum theory to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the induced velocity on the rotor disk, producing blade element momentum theory. At the most basic level of approximation a uniform induced velocity on the disk is assumed:", "400x400px|Fig 2. Aerodynamic forces on a blade element.|thumbWhile the momentum theory is useful for determining ideal efficiency, it gives a very incomplete account of the action of screw propellers, neglecting among other things the torque. In order to investigate propeller action in greater detail, the blades are considered as made up of a number of small elements, and the air forces on each element are calculated. Thus, while the momentum theory deals with the flow of the air, the blade-element theory deals primarily with the forces on the propeller blades. The idea of analyzing the forces on elementary strips of propeller blades was first published by William Froude in 1878. It was also worked out independently by Drzewiecki and given in a book on mechanical flight published in Russia seven years later, in 1885.This fact, which is not generally known in English-speaking countries, was called to the author\u2019s attention by Prof. F. W. Pawlowski of the University of Michigan. Drzewiecki\u2019s first French paper on his theory was published in 1892.

Again, in 1907, Lanchester published a somewhat more advanced form of the blade-element theory without knowledge of previous work on the subject. The simple blade-element theory is usually referred to, however, as the Drzewiecki theory, for it was Drzewiecki who put it into practical form and brought it into general use. Also, he was the first to sum up the forces on the blade elements to obtain the thrust and torque for a whole propeller and the first to introduce the idea of using airfoil data to find the forces on the blade elements."]}, {"page": "Scientific phenomena named after people", "response": ["* Froude number \u2013 William Froude"]}, {"page": "List of irregularly spelled English names", "response": ["|William Froude"]}, {"page": "Ship model basin", "response": ["thumb|right|US Experimental Model Basin, circa 1900The eminent English engineer, William Froude published a series of influential papers on ship designs for maximising stability in the 1860s.
