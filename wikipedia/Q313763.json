Approximately half of his total appearances were for Arsenal, and he was part of the side that won the Football League Championship and FA Cup \"double\" in 1971. Graham also made 17 appearances for California Surf in the NASL in 1978.\nHe then moved to the coaching staff at Crystal Palace, before joining former Palace manager Terry Venables as a coach at Queens Park Rangers. As a manager, he won numerous honours with Arsenal between 1987 and 1995, including two league titles (in 1989 and 1991), the 1993 FA Cup, two Football League Cups (in 1987 and 1993), as well as the 1994 European Cup-Winners'-Cup and also managed Millwall, Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur.\nHe was one of the most successful managers in Arsenal's history, remaining in charge for almost a decade until he was sacked by the club's board after being found guilty by the Football Association of taking money from transfers; Graham was banned despite paying back the money, which he always claimed was an \"unsolicited gift\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arsenal F.C.", "response": ["Arsenal tentatively appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee as acting manager in 1966.
