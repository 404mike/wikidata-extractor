He represented Ireland internationally, winning 29 caps, and toured with the 2001 British & Irish Lions, winning three caps.\nEducated at the Tiffin School, Kingston upon Thames, Henderson's natural athletic ability and aggression were effectively harnessed by rugby coach Dave Morris.Henderson played for London Irish, Wasps, Leinster and joined Munster in late 2001. Whilst at Wasps he helped them win the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 1999 and 2000; he was a replacement in the 1999 final but started in 2000.Henderson's career highlights at Munster include his tackle on Austin Healey in April 2003, which contributed to the try which was scored a mere two minutes later.  An injured Austin was unable to defend his line after being \"Hendoed\" and Ronan O'Gara got over the line.\nHenderson joined the French side Toulon, then of Pro D2, in 2006 and played for three years there, including their promotion to the Top 14 in 2008, before returning to the UK to sign for Esher RFC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wasps RFC", "response": ["* 2001: Rob Henderson, Phil Greening, Lawrence Dallaglio"]}, {"page": "Ireland national rugby union team", "response": ["* Rob Henderson: 2001"]}, {"page": "Munster Rugby", "response": ["|Rob HendersonRonan O'GaraDavid WallaceKeith Wood (2)"]}, {"page": "Tiffin School", "response": ["* Rob Henderson, rugby union player for Ireland and the British and Irish Lions \"Lion Rob glad to ring the changes\",  Chris Jones, Evening Standard, 27 February 2001"]}, {"page": "2001 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia", "response": ["|Rob Henderson||Centre || London Wasps |||| "]}, {"page": "RC Toulonnais", "response": ["* Rob Henderson"]}, {"page": "Robert Henderson (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rob Henderson"]}, {"page": "Garryowen Football Club", "response": ["* Rob Henderson 32 Caps, 1996 (Samoa) to 2003 (Italy)", "* Rob Henderson, 2001, played in 3 tests."]}, {"page": "Young Munster", "response": ["* Rob Henderson"]}]}}
