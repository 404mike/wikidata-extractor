Just when Charlie spots Eggsy in the lair, he is knocked out after being shocked with Eggsy's electric signet ring. It is revealed in Kingsman: The Golden Circle that the electric shock dislodged the explosive implant on Charlie's neck, causing him to only lose his arm and vocal chords upon its detonation. He is recruited into the Golden Circle by Poppy Adams and is given a cybernetic arm and voice box before exacting revenge against Eggsy and Kingsman. The arm is lost during a car chase and fight with Eggsy, but Poppy replaces it with an upgraded model she calls \"Arm-ageddon\" as a reward for helping her destroy all of Kingsman's establishments in Britain. (Eggsy and Merlin are the only survivors of the attack, Eggsy because he was away from home at the time and Merlin because his address was not listed in the Kingsman database.) While fighting Eggsy hand-to-hand at Poppy Land, Charlie is forced to disconnect the arm after Eggsy hacks into its programming.
