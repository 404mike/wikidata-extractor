He composed two books of sacred music in a 19th-century classical style published between 1817 and 1822, Sacred Music and A 2d Collection of Sacred Music. Both books were published in York by Samuel Knapton (the father of the organist and composer Philip Knapton). They comprise 17 settings of metrical psalm and hymn texts (8 in the first book and 9 in the second), with orchestral and keyboard accompaniments, and are dedicated to Richard Lumley-Saunderson, 6th Earl of Scarbrough. There are copies of both books in the Sheffield Local Studies Library.\nFoster is now best known as the composer of a tune known as Old Foster, to which the words While shepherds watched their flocks by night are sung in the South Yorkshire pub carolling tradition (for example, at the Fountain Inn at Ingbirchworth). A version of the tune is also sung at Castleton, Derbyshire, where it is known as Prince of Orange and used with the words Hark, the glad sound! the Saviour comes, by Philip Doddridge. The tune was originally published in A 2d Collection of Sacred Music as a setting of Psalm 47 in the metrical version by John Hopkins, Ye people all with one accord: the pub carol tradition is thought to originate from the ejection of 'west gallery' choirs and bands from parish churches in the mid-nineteenth century.Foster is credited by Alfred Gatty, vicar of Ecclesfield from 1839 to 1903, with the suppression of dog- and cock-fighting in the local area.Commercial recordings of two of Foster's works, with full orchestral accompaniments, have been made by the group 'Psalmody' conducted by Peter Holman. Their first CD While shepherds watched includes While shepherds watched their flocks by night sung to the 'Old Foster' or Ps. 47 tune, while their CD Haydn and his English Friends includes The God of Gods, the Lord, also taken from A 2d Collection of Sacred Music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Foster", "response": ["John Foster may refer to:", "*John Foster (MP for Bristol), 15th-century MP for Bristol", "*John Foster (died 1576), Member of Parliament for Winchester, Plympton Erle and Hindon", "*John Foster (by 1508-47/51), MP for Much Wenlock", "*John Foster (died 1558), MP for Shaftesbury and Hertfordshire", "*John Foster of Dunleer (died 1747), MP for Dunleer, grandfather of 1st Baron Oriel", "*John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel (1740\u20131828), speaker of the Irish House of Commons", "*John Foster (Dunleer MP) (1770\u20131792), MP for Dunleer 1790\u20131792, son of 1st Baron Oriel", "*John Foster (Australian politician) (1818\u20131900), politician in colonial New South Wales and Victoria", "*John Foster (British politician) (1904\u20131982), British Conservative Party politician", "*John Foster (Lord Mayor of York) on List of Lord Mayors of York", "*John Foster (Manitoba politician) in 1927 Manitoba general election", "*John Foster (Tasmanian politician) (1792\u20131875) member for Electoral division of Huon", "*John Foster (Virginia politician) on List of mayors of Richmond, Virginia", "*John Foster (essayist) (1770\u20131843), English essayist", "*John Foster (philosopher) (1941\u20132009), British philosopher", "*John Foster (canon) (died 1773), headmaster of Eton College", "*John Foster (paleontologist) (born 1966), American paleontologist", "*John Foster (British singer) (born 1960), British singer", "*John Foster (Italian singer) (born 1939), Italian singer", "*John Foster (cartoonist) (1886\u20131959), also director", "*John Foster (printer) (1648\u20131681), American printer and engraver", "*John Foster, a character in the television series Skins", "*John Foster (cinematographer), see Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography", "*John Foster (composer) (1752\u20131822), English composer", "*John Foster Jr. (sailor) (born 1963), American sport-sailor", "*John Foster Sr. (sailor) (born 1938), American sport-sailor & sled racer", "*John Foster (footballer) (born 1973), English footballer", "*John Foster (baseball) (born 1978), American baseball player", "*John Foster (cricketer) (born 1955), former English cricketer", "*John Foster (sport shooter) (born 1936), American sports shooter", "*John Foster (water polo), played Water polo at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team squads", "*John Foster (Canadian journalist), see This Land", "*John Foster (BBC journalist) on Agenda", "*John Foster (journalist), see Eyre Evans Crowe", "*John Foster (priest) (1921\u20132000), Anglican dean of Guernsey", "*Rev.
