Schleicher criticized the current Hitler cabinet while some of Schleicher's followers such as General Ferdinand von Bredow and Werner von Alvensleben started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become Vice-Chancellor, R\u00f6hm Minister of Defence, Heinrich Br\u00fcning Foreign Minister and Gregor Strasser Minister of National Economy. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a \"lack of discretion\" that was \"terrifying\" as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested.

The three men were charged with membership in the Nazi Party although membership in political parties was forbidden for members of the Reichswehr. The three officers admitted their membership and used as their defence the claim that the Nazi Party membership should not be forbidden to Reichswehr personnel. When the three officers were arrested after being caught red-handed distributing Nazi literature at their base, Beck, the commanding officer of the 5th Artillery Regiment based in Ulm, to which the three Nazi officers belonged, was furious and argued that since the Nazi Party was a force for good, Reichswehr personnel should not be banned from joining the party. At the preliminary hearing, Beck spoke on behalf of the three officers. At the Leipzig trial of Ludin and Scheringer, Beck testified to the good character of the accused, described the Nazi Party as a positive force in German life and proclaimed his belief that the Reichswehr ban on Nazi Party membership should be rescinded. When Lieutenant Scheringer spoke of a future war in which the Nazi Party and the Reichswehr would fight hand in hand as brothers in a \"war of liberation\" to abrogate the Treaty of Versailles, Beck supported Scheringer by testifying, \"The Reichswehr is told daily that it is an army of leaders. What is a young officer to understand by that?\" Historians such as Sir John Wheeler-Bennett have noted that Beck was deliberately distorting the principle of Hans von Seeckt's F\u00fchrerarmee (\"Army of Leaders\"), which trained soldiers to be leaders for when the army would be expanded beyond the limits permitted by the Treaty of Versailles, by seeking to apply it to politics."]}, {"page": "Garsington Manor", "response": ["The Morrells restored the house in the 1920s, working with the architect Philip Tilden, and creating landscaped Italian-style gardens.

This was designed by Charles Edward Mallows; beyond, is a wild garden, with lime-tree avenues, shrubs, a stream and pond. Financial difficulties forced the Morrells to sell Garsington in 1928.

Many of the DNVP's supporters made it clear by 1924 that they were unhappy about supporting a party whose role was purely negative in opposing everything that the government did while refusing to take part in any of the coalition governments. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett wrote \"At no time during the Weimar Republic did they make a single constructive contribution to the government of the country\".

The Chinese historian Liang Hsi-Huey wrote there was a certain dichotomy in Trott's thinking between his dislike of the Nazis vs. his support for Germany's great power ambitions, which made for an ambivalent attitude towards Nazi foreign policy. Liang, whose father Liang Lone was the Chinese minister in Prague between 1933\u201339, wrote that people like Trott, conservative nationalists opposed to Hitler and who sympathised with China in its struggle against Japan, had much difficulty with accepting the thesis that nations like Czechoslovakia had the right to exist.

The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew most of the men involved in the plots against Hitler between 1938-44 personally, wrote these men were all nationalists whose views towards Czechoslovakia and Poland were essentially the same as Hitler's-namely that Eastern Europe was Germany's rightful sphere of influence and the Reich had the right to take whatever it wanted in the region.

In October 1937, during a visit to the United States, Goerdeler stayed with the British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett at the latter's estate in Virginia and informed him of his desire to restore the monarchy in Germany. During the same trip, Goerdeler drafted his \"Political Testament\", attacking Nazi economic policies and criticized the regime for its anti-Christian policies, widespread corruption and lawlessness. Goerdeler met several times with Winston Churchill and Vansittart.", "In the tense atmosphere of September 1938, with the crisis in Central Europe looking likely to explode into war at any moment, Goerdeler was waiting anxiously for the putsch to overthrow the Nazi regime, and his taking over the reins of the German state as the new Chancellor. During his planning for the coup, Goerdeler was in contact with Chinese intelligence, using General Alexander von Falkenhausen as intermediary. Like most German conservatives, Goerdeler favoured Germany's traditional informal alliance with China, and was strongly opposed to the volte-face in Germany's Far Eastern policies effected in early 1938 by the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, who abandoned the alliance with China for an alignment with Japan. In a September 1938 meeting with Young, the latter reported that \"X\" (as Goerdeler was code-named by the British) had stated about the domestic situation in Germany: \"the working classes are nervous, distrustful of the Leader.
