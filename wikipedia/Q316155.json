He is a pioneer of the early music movement.Holloway was born in Neath, Wales, and studied in London at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. After initial engagements, including at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and at the English Chamber Orchestra, he became manager and concertmaster of the Kent Opera Orchestra in the 1970s. After an encounter with Sigiswald Kuijken in 1972, he started playing the Baroque violin and gained a reputation as violinist, teacher and conductor in the field of historically informed performance.\nIn 1970 he became the concertmaster of Sir Roger Norrington's London Classical Players, and later Andrew Parrott's Taverner Consort and Players.  Besides playing in numerous Baroque orchestras, he is a noted musicologist and lecturer.\nHolloway has taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, the Schola Cantorum in Basel, and the Early Music Institute of Indiana University in Bloomington. He has given classes and led workshops in most European countries, as well as in Korea, New Zealand and the USA. In 2004, he was Regents\u2019 Lecturer at UC Berkeley.  In 1999, he began to teach at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik \"Carl Maria von Weber\" in Dresden.\nBetween 2003 and 2005 Holloway served as musical director of the Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra, and in 2005 and 2006  concertmaster and music director of the period instrument ensemble and orchestra known as New Trinity Baroque.\nIn 2005 he founded jointly with Belgian conductor and harpsichordist Florian Heyerick and a music agent the Mannheimer Hofkapelle, which in the summer of 2007 could be heard for the first time in 300 years with its original complement of 40 musicians.

The entire set has been recorded by numerous violinists such as John Holloway, Andrew Manze, and many others. Sonata 15 is famous for one of its themes, which matches the theme of Paganini's Caprice No. 24 almost exactly; it is possible that Paganini was inspired by Biber, just as Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and Sergei Rachmaninoff were later inspired by Paganini's Caprice.Hyperion Records | Heinrich Biber, hyperion-records.co.uk"]}, {"page": "ECM Records", "response": ["Over the years, many other works by contemporary composers such as Valentyn Sylvestrov, Tigran Mansurian, Erkki-Sven T\u00fc\u00fcr, Heinz Holliger, Giya Kancheli, Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g, or Heiner Goebbels as well as the soundtracks of several works by the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard have been issued on the ECM New Series label.
