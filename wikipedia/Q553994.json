New arrivals at the club were Glynn Snodin (\u00a3150,000 from Sheffield Wednesday), winger Gary Williams (\u00a3230,000 from Aston Villa) and Bobby Davison (\u00a3350,000 from Derby County), as well as Jim Melrose and Ken DeMange. A more significant new face was David Batty, a key player of the future who was given his debut from the youth team. United started the season inconsistently, but five straight wins in December won Bremner the Second Division Manager of the Month award. The inconsistent results returned however, and Leeds finished the 1987\u201388 season in seventh place, eight points outside the play-offs. Bremner did not enjoy a good relationship with the club's board, who felt him to be uncommunicative with them, and after a poor start to the 1988\u201389 season he was sacked in September 1988. His successor, Howard Wilkinson, was given money to spend by the board and Leeds went on to win promotion in 1990."]}, {"page": "Colin Gibson (footballer, born 1960)", "response": ["Born in Bridport, Dorset, Gibson started his career as a youth team scholar at Aston Villa in July 1976, and turned professional after he played in the 1978 FA Youth Cup defeat to Crystal Palace. After making his debut against Bristol City on 18 November 1978, he broke into the first team in a Ron Saunders side narrowly missing out on European qualification in 1978\u201379 and 1979\u201380. He faced competition from Gary Williams, Mike Pejic, and Eamonn Deacy for the left-back spot. He went on to make 21 appearances in the 1980\u201381 season, as the \"Villans\" were crowned First Division champions. He then played at Wembley in the 1981 FA Charity Shield, as Villa shared the trophy after a 2\u20132 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. In the 1981\u201382 campaign, he featured in both legs of the European Cup wins over Icelanders Valur and German side Berliner FC Dynamo, but remained on the bench for the 1982 European Cup Final victory over Bayern Munich at De Kuip. He took the trophy out on a night of drinking with Gordon Cowans and lost it, before it was returned to him the following day by police officers. He featured in both legs of Villa's 1982 European Super Cup victory over Barcelona, as Villa overturned a 1\u20130 defeat at the Camp Nou to claim an extra-time victory at Villa Park. Tony Barton's side went on to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup in 1982\u201383, where they were knocked out by a Juventus side fronted by Michel Platini.
