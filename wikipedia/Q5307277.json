After four years with the Methil club, he signed for St Johnstone which was where he remained for most of his playing days.\nPlaying in the centre of defence for St Johnstone over a span of nine seasons, he set a record for most appearances. This record stood until 2009, when it was surpassed by goalkeeper Alan Main. Rutherford was also club captain and a popular player with the club's supporters. His time at Perth began in February 1977 and he made a total of 342 appearances (plus five as a substitute) before leaving the club in May 1985. Despite being a defender, he managed 18 goals for St Johnstone.\nAfter leaving St Johnstone he had a short spell with another Fife club, Cowdenbeath, before retiring from the game.\nRutherford was held in such high regard by St Johnstone fans that, despite twenty years having passed since his time at the club, a benefit night was organised to raise funds after hearing of his illness. Although Rutherford himself was too ill to attend, his family was represented along with many of his former teammates.\nRutherford died in 2005 from cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Main", "response": ["Despite turning 41 in 2008, Main was still the number-one keeper for St Johnstone going into 2009.
