The Kenpeitai established the comfort women program to control the problem. The Kenpeitai forced and coerced many interned women to serve as prostitutes, including several hundred European women. A few of these chose to live in the homes of Japanese officers to serve one man as a sex slave rather than many men in a brothel. One such European woman, K'tut Tantri, wrote a book describing her ordeal. A Dutch government study described the methods used by the Japanese military to seize the women by force. It concluded that among the 200 to 300 European women found in the Japanese military brothels, \"some sixty five were most certainly forced into prostitution\". Others, faced with starvation in the refugee camps, agreed to offers of food and payment for work, the nature of which was not completely revealed to them.Poelgeest.

Prior to the fighting, she and a group of Indonesian rebels associated with Bung Tomo had established a secret radio station in the city which broadcast pro-Indonesian Republic messages that were directed at the British soldiers in the city. She noted that several British soldiers were unhappy with the Dutch for misleading them about the Indonesian Republicans being Japanese puppets and extremists. Following the British bombardment of the city, Tantri contacted several foreign diplomats and commercial attaches from Denmark, Switzerland, the Soviet Union, and Sweden. These countries had representatives in Surabaya. They agreed to inform their respective governments about the fighting in Surabaya and to take part in a joint broadcast protesting continuation of the fighting and calling for a ceasefire."]}, {"page": "Voice of Indonesia", "response": ["The Indonesian broadcasting across the world was named Voice of Free Indonesia On 11 September  1945, the radio station became Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI), the head organization of Voice of Indonesia. During the Indonesian National Revolution, a Scottish American woman named K'tut Tantri, who was sympathetic to the Indonesian republicans, made several English language-broadcasts on the Voice of Free Indonesia. Her broadcasts were targeted at Western listeners and she gained the nickname \"Surabaya Sue\" due to her support for the Indonesian nationalists. During the early days of Indonesian independence, radio broadcasting played an important role in sending the new nation's message to overseas audiences, which helped other nations recognize the sovereignty of Indonesia. In addition, the Voice of Free Indonesia was also the name of an Indonesian Republican magazine that was marketed at Western correspondents. In 1950, Voice of Free Indonesia was renamed the Voice of Indonesia.Voice of Indonesia - Background"]}, {"page": "1997 in the United States", "response": ["* July 27 \u2013 K'tut Tantri, American broadcaster and hotelier, (b. 1899)"]}, {"page": "Muriel Stuart Walker", "response": ["#REDIRECT K'tut Tantri"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 1997", "response": ["*K'tut Tantri, 99, Scottish American hotelier and broadcaster known as \"Surabaya Sue\"."]}]}}
