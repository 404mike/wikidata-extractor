He played club level rugby union (RU) for Newport RFC, as a hooker, i.e. number 2, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain (non-Test matches), and Wales, and at club level for Swinton, as a hooker, i.e. number 9, during the era of contested scrums.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swinton Lions", "response": ["Throughout the late 1940s, and the 1950s the Lions strove unsuccessfully to repeat former glories and often flattered to deceive, but the appointment of Welshman Cliff Evans as coach signalled a renaissance. Concentrating on a youth policy and training methods beyond his era, Evans began to model an exciting, young Swinton team. This new era saw some notable Welshmen in the Lions' ranks such as Rees Thomas, Ralph Morgan, Frank Osmond, Dai Moses, Ron Morgan and Graham Rees. Also in the 'swinging 1960s' years the Lions fielded real top class performers such as GB internationals Ken Gowers at full-back, Alan Buckley at left-centre plus his wing partner, John Stopford. During this same decade, local talent came to the fore with the likes of Graham Williams (scrum-half), Derek Whitehead (full-back/utility), Barry Simpson (2nd-row) and classy GB loose-forward Dave Robinson. During the second half of the decade other prominent players turned out for the Lions. Of these, perhaps the most worthy were stand-off Billy 'Daz' Davies, scrum-half Peter Kenny and 2nd-rowers Rod Smith (ex-Workington Town) and the highly respected Bill Holliday (ex-Whitehaven, Hull Kingston Rovers, Cumberland and GB). In fact it was the Lions 1960s quartet of Gowers, Buckley, Stopford and Robinson who were selected to play for the GB tourists on the 1966 tour to Australasia. Gowers was even given the honour of being awarded the position of tour vice-captain. However, some critics saw this as an apology for overlooking him when the previous tourists were chosen in 1962, when many believe he was easily the most outstanding player to wear a full-back's jersey in the British game.", "* Frank Osmond represented Great Britain while at Swinton in non-Test matches on the 1950 tour of Australasia, and won caps for Wales while at Swinton 1948\u20131951 14-caps"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain national rugby league team players", "response": ["*Frank Osmond"]}, {"page": "Osmond (surname)", "response": ["*Frank Osmond, Welsh rugby union and rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "1950 Great Britain Lions tour", "response": ["| align=left |  Frank Osmond ||  || 30 || 13 st. 7 lb.
