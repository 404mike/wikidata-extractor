For his education Elwes first attended two Catholic schools, Ladycross School in Seaford, and the Oratory School in Edgbaston. In 1918, at the age of sixteen, he was taken out of the Oratory and installed in the Slade School of Fine Art where Henry Tonks and Philip Wilson Steer taught. After the Slade Elwes spent eight years in Paris, first at the Acad\u00e9mie Del\u00e9cluse and then at the Academie des Beaux Arts. While there he met a Belgian refugee, Mme. La Forge, who aroused his latent interest in painting. Mme. La Forge gave him the run of her studio and encouraged him to start again where he had left off. In 1920, Elwes began studying in earnest at Andre Lhote's Academy in Montparnasse, Paris. Fellow students included Henri Cartier-Bresson, Conrad O'Brien-ffrench and Elena Mumm Thornton Wilson.  While in Paris Elwes did a black and white drawing of the Irish tenor and recording artist, John McCormack. McCormack would say to his wife of Elwes: \"This lad has remarkable talent and will do big things, mark my words.\" From France Elwes visited art galleries in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. In 1922, Elwes sailed to New York, having borrowed the fare. He repaid the loan by doing charcoal drawings at $5 to $20 apiece. During this visit he managed to draw President Harding from life. In 1926, he returned to England and on 25 November married the Hon.
