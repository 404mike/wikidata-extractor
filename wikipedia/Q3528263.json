His all-round usefulness is shown by the fact that he made 1,000 runs in a season six times and took 100 wickets five times. He did the all-rounder's double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season three times, in 1921, 1927 and 1929. He was captain of Middlesex for six seasons from 1929, sharing the job in the last two years with H. J. Enthoven.\nHaig's Test match career was undistinguished. He was brought into the England team, like so many others, for just one match and then discarded in the 1921 series against the all-conquering Australians under Warwick Armstrong. Eight years later, in 1929-30, he was a member of Freddie Calthorpe's team that played the first four Tests in the West Indies.\nHaig was a nephew of Lord Harris and an all-round sportsman, good at ice hockey, real tennis, lawn tennis, rackets, soccer, rugby union and golf. During the First World War, while serving with the Royal Field Artillery, Haig was awarded the Military Cross in the 1917 Birthday Honours.Ian Peebles, who played under Haig at Middlesex, said of him: \"He had a witty and active mind, with interests ranging from bird watching to music and poetry. He was a wonderful companion and guide to us youngsters, and he had a hot Scots temper which kept us, very properly, in some awe of him.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Nigel Haig \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Harry Lee (cricketer)", "response": ["Despite the injury he sustained during the war, when county cricket resumed in 1919, Lee took his leave of the Maharaja and returned to England to resume his career with Middlesex. County Championship matches were played over two days, an experiment which was unpopular with Lee, who described it as a \"nightmare season\".Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 52. Even with these shorter matches, Lee passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the first time in his career, and won himself a regular place in the Middlesex side. Originally from  He scored four centuries during the season, including one in each innings of a charity match played against Surrey at The Oval. During the first innings, he reached 163, sharing a second wicket partnership of 226 with Jack Hearne, and in the second he scored 126. His batting average for the season was 40.76; the first of only three times that it would exceed 40 during his career. The championship reverted to three-day matches for 1920, and Lee enjoyed his greatest successes as a batsman during the season. He scored centuries in successive matches in mid-May, reaching 102 against Warwickshire at Lord's, and then 119 against Sussex at the same venue. Against Sussex, each of Middlesex's top four batsmen scored centuries; in addition to Lee's 119 runs, Pelham Warner scored 139, Nigel Haig 131, and Hearne remained 116 not out when the side declared. This was the first time the feat had been achieved in first-class cricket.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 54\u201355. Lee also took eleven wickets in the match, taking five in the first innings and six in the second to complete his maiden ten-wicket haul. In doing so, he became one of only eight Middlesex cricketers to have taken ten wickets in the same match as scoring a century. Playing against Hampshire at Southampton the following month, Lee scored his first double century, being 221 not out when Middlesex declared. He was also not out in the second innings, meaning that he was on the pitch for the full duration of the match. In total, Lee scored 1,518 runs at an average of 43.37 in first-class matches in 1920. He ranked third amongst Middlesex batsmen\u2014by both runs scored and batting average\u2014in the County Championship, which the county won narrowly, completing victory in the final session of their final match.Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 386. In A History of Cricket, H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton praise Lee's \"all-round excellence\" during the season: in addition to his runs, he claimed 40 wickets in the Championship at an average of 22.40."]}, {"page": "Mervyn Grell", "response": ["A hard-hitting lower-order batsman and a medium-pace bowler, Mervyn Grell played only a handful of first-class matches between 1930 and 1937.  The first two were for Trinidad against the visiting MCC in 1929-30. On his debut, played at Port-of-Spain in January 1930, he scored 40 and 54 batting at number 9 and 8 respectively; he top-scored in Trinidad's first innings and was their second-highest scorer in the second. He also took the wickets of Nigel Haig and Les Townsend in the visitors' second innings, both players caught by wicketkeeper Errol Hunte. In his second match a few days later, also against MCC in Port-of-Spain, Grell was asked to captain Trinidad, and followed a duck in the first innings with the top score of the match in the second, 34 not out, when he led a rearguard action that almost brought victory.
