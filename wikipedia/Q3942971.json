She was the oldest active athlete.  She is the current holder of the masters world record in numerous events including the W85 Triple Jump, W100 Shot Put, Discus, Hammer Throw, Weight Throw and Javelin Throw and was the oldest competitor to complete a Throws Pentathlon and thus holds the record in that event.  In younger age divisions, she held many more records that have been surpassed.\nHer famous quote for longevity:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat vegetables, because I never eat vegetables. I know people that like diets that will scream at me, (but) don\u2019t eat vegetables. I never have.\u201d\nShe was the mother of Australian Olympic jumper and pentathlete Helen Frith, who under her married name of Searle is also a multiple masters world record holder.", "link_mentions": {}}}
