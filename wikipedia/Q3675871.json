His most important contributions, however, are on the life and works of Machaut, as well as medieval music theory. Beginning with his 1952 dissertation, Reaney published a variety of scholarship on the Machaut. This included studies on Machaut's formes fixes, lais, performance, and numerous articles in encyclopedias such as Encyclop\u00e9die de la musique and Encyclopaedia Britannica. By way of an interdisciplinary approach of both music and literature, he developed new theories on the performance of how medieval musicians performed Machaut's music, influencing the practices of early music groups such as Gothic Voices led by Christopher Page.
