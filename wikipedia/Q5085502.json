Shaw, playing as a winger, made his West Bromwich Albion and League debut on 29 September 1888 at Stoney Lane, the then home of West Bromwich Albion. The visitors were Burnley who were defeated by the home team 4\u20133. In the same match Charlie Shaw scored his club, League debut goal and only League goal of his career. When the score was 3\u20133 Shaw scored what proved to be the winning goal in controversial circumstances. In the last minute the referee, Mr Jope, agreed with Albion's claims that a shot from Charlie Shaw, in his only League game for the Baggies, had gone under the bar before being fisted away by Robert Kay, a decision 'hotly contested by the visitors'. Albion had won 4\u20133, but both sides had provided great entertainment for the crowd.An eager\u2013beaver left\u2013winger, Charlie Shaw came to Albion on a month's trial, playing just one senior game and scoring a goal against Burnley (home) in Division One in September 1888, (won 4\u20133). He spent most of his career playing for the Swifts (Walsall) and represented the Staffordshire FA XI and the Birmingham FA XI in 1888\u201389.
