Challen's batting and bowling styles are unknown.  He was born at Kirdford, Sussex.\nChallen made his first-class debut for Sussex against Kent in 1848.  He made eighteen further first-class appearances for the county, the last of which came against Kent in 1857.  In his nineteen first-class appearances for Sussex, he took 23 wickets at an average of 14.75, with the most wickets he took in a single innings standing at 4.  Due to incomplete records, his exact best figures are unknown.  Challen played as a bowler, as such he had little success with the bat.  He scored a total of 323 runs for Sussex, which came at a batting average of 9.22, with a high score of 37.  Challen also made a single first-class appearance each for the Players against the Gentlemen in 1854, and for England against the Marylebone Cricket Club in the same year.He died somewhere in Sussex in 1900.
