Moreover, an article by Amit Chaudhuri, in The Guardian, suggested the criticism was \"unsurprising and overdue\". However, Oriel College opted to keep the Rhodes statue, despite the protests. Oriel College claimed in 2016 they would lose about \u00a3100 million worth of gifts if they removed the statue.
