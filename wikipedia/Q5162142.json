The Royal University of Ireland formerly known as the Catholic University of Ireland and the Queen's University of Ireland, the Royal University of Ireland was dissolved on 31 October 1909. The National University of Ireland and the Queen's University of Belfast took over its functions under the Irish Universities Act 1908. A high number of graduates at the University at this time were females (first nine in 1884) because Trinity College Dublin didn't accept female students until 1904. Dr. Fleury became a successful psychiatrist, as well as the first woman member of the Medico-Psychological Association (MPA), now known as the Royal College of Psychiatrists. In 1893, she was proposed by Dr. Conolly Norman, a president of the MPA and one-time editor of the Journal of Mental Science. This was denied for a year, due to the reasoning that the association rules had to be changed to allow her admission. In 1894 she was elected by 23 votes to 7. This made her the first female psychiatrist in Ireland and Great Britain. She had been a student at the Richmond Hospital, in Dublin and the London School of Medicine for Women for a three-month course of clinical instruction in mental diseases. In April 1890 she passed the final examination at RUI and was first in order of merit. Following qualification, she worked at the Homerton Fever Hospital in London for a year before returning to Ireland to work at the Richmond Asylum (later called Grangegorman) for 27 years.
