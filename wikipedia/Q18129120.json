Splits were recorded at 400 metres, 800 metres, and 1200 metres.  Michel Bernard led after the first lap, Josef Odlo\u017eil and John Davies were in front after two.  Wary of being boxed in as he was in the 1960 Olympic 800, at the bell his countryman Davies held the lead while Snell was boxed in by Dyrol Burleson.  He slowed then decisively moved to the outside to be in a position to run.  Others were also scrambling for position, Witold Baran made his move and had the lead at the end of the third lap but Davies again assumed the lead down the backstretch.  With about 220 metres to go, Snell accelerated, blowing past Baran and Davies, the others would now be racing for second place.  Snell extended his lead to almost 10 metres, crossing the finish line 1.5 seconds ahead of anyone else.  Through the turn, Alan Simpson got around Davies and Baran, behind them Burleson was moving to the outside.  Even further back, Odlo\u017eil began his final sprint around the outside of Burleson.  Davies was able to get barely ahead of Simpson, holding him off at the finish line but that would only be for bronze as Odlo\u017eil came roaring down the home stretch, catching both before the finish to grab silver.", "| 4 ||align=left| Alan Simpson ||align=left|  || 0:58.9 || 2:01.0 || 3:00.0 || 3:39.7"]}, {"page": "Thrybergh", "response": ["*Alan Simpson (Olympian) who attended St Gerard's Catholic Primary School"]}, {"page": "John Whetton", "response": ["Whetton ran amateur athletics for local club Sutton-in-Ashfield Harriers.
