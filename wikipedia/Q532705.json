On April 1, 2006, a teaser site was launched with details revealing the October 13 release date. Many forum sites such as IMDb were swamped with claims that Sony was playing an April Fool's joke. A few days later, the site's authenticity was proven and claims that it was a hoax were dismissed. On September 10, 2006, Sony released a missing persons file on its official blog stating a student filmmaker known as \"Jason C\" (Jason Cutler) disappeared a few weeks after visiting the set of the film. The blog originally broadcast interviews with the film's stars including Tamblyn, Gellar and Jenna Dewan but had been taken over by his roommate who filed the report. On September 19, 2006, Yahoo! Movies was the first site to release three short films titled Tales from the Grudge with an introduction from one of the producers of The Grudge, Sam Raimi. The series of shorts expands on the story of the Saeki curse. The shorts also appear on the film's official site Sony Pictures Entertainment; fans who volunteered their mobile phone number received surprise calls from Kayako or Toshio. The films also became available on other film and horror-related websites as part of a wide-reaching and unique digital marketing strategy. The shorts were directed by Toby Wilkins (director of The Grudge 3) and written by Ben Ketai."]}, {"page": "The Grudge 3", "response": ["The Grudge 3 is a 2009 American supernatural horror film and the third and final installment in The Grudge original trilogy.

Phonographic Memory was released November 10, 2006, on Emerald Wood Records, and was an instant critical success. KUT's David Brown said of the record, \"...It's easy to understand how special this Austin-based band is: Every song on its debut sounds both strangely familiar and utterly new.\" A track from the record, \"West\", was named as NPR's \"Song of the Day\" on November 27, 2006, and was later featured in the soundtrack of the award-winning indie horror film \"Splinter\" by director Toby Wilkins, released in October 2008. Another track from the album, \"Stop\", was featured on Latchkey Record's Indy Route: Austin compilation, representing the state of Texas. After touring the United States in support of the album for most of 2007 and releasing a single, \"Body Offering\", guitarist Colin Slagle left the band. In March 2008, Austin Monthly named The Alice Rose one of \"8 Artists to Watch in 2008\". The quartet began work on their second album that same month, working with producer and engineer Andy Sharp at Music Lane Studio in Austin. During the middle of the sessions, lead guitarist Gregg White joined the group in July. White's first appearance with band was on the Halloween single \"Bloody Mary\", engineered by JoDee at Emerald Wood Studio, and released October 31, 2008. White also contributed lead guitar on two songs on the album, \"Waste Away\", and \"There's No One In There\", both of which were recorded towards the end of the sessions that October in order to include his presence on the album. All Haunt's Sound was released on February 21, 2009 to mixed reviews. Some criticized the production as too radio friendly,http://www.austinsound.net/2009/05/07/the-alice-rose-all-haunts-sound-sr/ while others, like the Austin Chronicle's Austin Powell, said of the record, \"Not since Robert Harrison's Cotton Mather has an Austin band so successfully churned out power pop nuggets like the Alice Rose.\" The band followed up the album with a four track 7\" vinyl EP, In a Daze, also recorded by JoDee, and released as a rare limited edition pressing of 100 copies on July 16, 2009, although digital downloads were made available to the group's fanclub. The band's next plan was to release a live album. An acoustic performance at Flipnotics and an electric set at Antone's were both recorded but were scrapped due to technical problems."]}, {"page": "List of horror films of 2008", "response": ["| Toby Wilkins || Paulo Costanzo, Jill Wagner, Rachel Kerbs || United States || "]}, {"page": "List of horror films of 2009", "response": ["| Toby Wilkins || Johanna Braddy || United States || "]}, {"page": "Ghost House Pictures", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Toby Wilkins"]}, {"page": "Phonographic Memory", "response": ["Shortly after the record's release, the song \"West\" was named NPR's \"Song of the Day\" on November 27, 2006.
