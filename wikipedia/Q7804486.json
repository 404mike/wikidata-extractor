The ancient writer Apollodorus of Athens writing during the 2nd century BC, thought Thales was born about the year 625 BC. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, described Thales as \"a Phoenician by remote descent\". However, the probability is that he was as Greek as most Milesians since his ancestors were Cadmeians from Boeotia and not Semites. Tim Whitmarsh wrote that Thales regarded water as the primal matter, and because thal is the Phoenician word for moisture, his name may have derived from this circumstance.

Given monotheism at the time was a minority view, atheism generally attacked polytheistic beliefs and associated practices in references found. The word \"atheos\" (godless) also was used for religious dissent generally (including the monotheists) which complicates study further. Despite these difficulties, Whitmarsh believes that otherwise atheism then was much the same. While atheists (or people perceived as such) were occasionally persecuted, this was rare (perhaps due to being a small group, plus a relative tolerance toward different religious views). Other scholars believe it arose later in the modern era. Lucien Febvre has referred to the \"unthinkability\" of atheism in its strongest sense before the sixteenth century, because of the \"deep religiosity\" of that era. Karen Armstrong has concurred, writing \"from birth and baptism to death and burial in the churchyard, religion dominated the life of every single man and woman. Every activity of the day, which was punctuated by church bells summoning the faithful to prayer, was saturated with religious beliefs and institutions: they dominated professional and public life\u2014even the guilds and the universities were religious organizations. ... Even if an exceptional man could have achieved the objectivity necessary to question the nature of religion and the existence of God, he would have found no support in either the philosophy or the science of his time.\" As governmental authority rested on the notion of divine right, it was threatened by those who denied the existence of the local god. Those labeled as atheist, including early Christians and Muslims, were as a result targeted for legal persecution."]}, {"page": "Emily Wilson (classicist)", "response": ["*Tim Whitmarsh, \"Nero to Zero\", Literary Review, March 2015."]}, {"page": "A.

Tim Whitmarsh, a professor of Greek culture at the University of Cambridge, defended the production, arguing that historical Greeks were \"unlikely to be uniformly pale-skinned\", that \"dark-skinned North Africans existed\" in ancient Greece, citing Memnon of Ethiopia as an example. Whitemarsh also stated the question of whether \u2018black people\u2019 lived in Ancient Greece is itself flawed as the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of \"race\". He added that \"Our best estimate is that the Greeks would be a spectrum of hair colours and skin types in antiquity.
