Her debut album, Ellie, was released in 2001. The album proved to be unsuccessful, it failed to chart in the UK, though it charted at #192 in Australia.A cover of Dee Dee Warwick's \"You're No Good\" was due to be the fourth single in the UK, but after the album flopped, plans were shelved despite a music video being shot and played many times on The Box. However, the single did get a release in the United States, but it failed to chart.\nIn Australia, \"Don't Want You Back\" was released as her debut single. It reached #44 in 2001, and was in the charts for five weeks. \"You're No Good\" was released later that year, but failed to chart.
