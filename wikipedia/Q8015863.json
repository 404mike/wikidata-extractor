Most likely born in Northumberland, he played the majority of his career in local-league football but also had spells in The Football League. Morton played for Bedlington P.M. and Newbiggin West End before joining Third Division North side Durham City in 1927. However, he was unable to break into the first-team and did not make a senior appearance for the club. He left Durham the following year and returned to non-League football with Craghead United. In January 1929, Morton was signed by Third Division North outfit Nelson, initially as an amateur. He scored twice on his debut in the 4\u20131 win against Stockport County on 22 January and was awarded a professional contract the following month. He went on to score three goals in eight League appearances for Nelson, but he was unable to displace Bernard Radford as the club's first-choice centre forward, and was not retained at the end of the 1928\u201329 season.\nFor the 1929\u201330 campaign, Morton returned to the North East with Craghead United, and later had spells with Bedlington United and Blyth Spartans. In November 1930, he transferred to Third Division South club Queens Park Rangers but he did not play any League matches for the London-based outfit. His stay at QPR was brief, and he re-joined Craghead United for a third time in January 1931. Morton then spent the 1932\u201333 season with former League club Ashington before moving in June 1933 to Stakeford Albion, where he ended his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Morton", "response": ["William Morton may refer to:", "*William Morton (fl.1388), Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester", "*William Morton (MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed), MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed", "*William Morton (judge) (1605\u20131672), English judge and MP", "*William Morton (American politician), mayor of Lancaster, Pennsylvania", "*William Morton (Manitoba politician) (1884\u20131958), Canadian politician", "*William Morton (boxer), American boxer, see Boxing at the 1955 Pan American Games", "*William Morton (cricketer) (1961\u20132019), Scottish cricketer", "*William Morton (cyclist) (1880\u20131952), Canadian cyclist", "*William Morton (footballer), English footballer", "*William Morton (tenor) (1912-1995), Canadian opera singer", "*William Morton (priest) (born 1956), Dean of Derry", "*William Morton (theatre manager) (1839\u20131939), amusement caterer and theatre and cinema manager in England"]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|William Morton"]}]}}
