A fortnight later against Hampshire he claimed a career-best 7-51, but he was never to achieve anything like that success again, taking more than one wicket in only two more games. He did, however, manage his modest best score with the bat (28) against Lancashire in July.\nHarrison played in two of Worcestershire's early-season games in May 1935, but took no wickets: indeed, he came in for some fearful punishment in the opener against Sussex, recording an unattractive first-innings analysis of 17-2-101-0 in a game Worcestershire were to lose by an innings. His final first-class match was against Lancashire later that month, where he bowled just seven overs without reward.\nHarrison was born in Droitwich, Worcestershire; he died in the same town at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": {}}}
