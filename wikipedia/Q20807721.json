Brentford started the Southern League First Division season poorly and with the club entering a period of financial instability, the relationship between the committee and the players began to deteriorate.

Manager Halliday was forced to play natural centre forward Adam Bowman at inside forward, which conflicted with centre forward Geordie Reid's role and necessitated the transfer swap of Bowman for Portsmouth inside forward Bill McCafferty in October 1909. After exiting the FA Cup in the second round at the hands of Accrington Stanley, Brentford emerged from a poor Christmas and January to win 10 and draw four of the final 17 matches of the season. The Bees finished comfortably in 14th position."]}]}}
