Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism. The two were never so close as Barbauld and her father.Rodgers, p. 30. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter, \"I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall.\"Quoted in Anna Letitia Le Breton, pp. 23\u201324.", "Barbauld's adopted son Charles married a daughter of Gilbert Wakefield.McCarthy, \"Posthumous Reception,\" p. 444.
