He married in 1902, and their six children attended Solomontown school.He was a dedicated unionist, and a member of the Amalgamated Mining Union organised by Tom Mann. The union went on strike in 1909 after management at the smelters reduced their pay from 8/3d per day to 7/3d, and was not called off until six months later, when Mr. Justice Higgins ordered a return to work at 8/3d. Dale had kept his family fed and clothed by trapping rabbits.", "link_mentions": {}}}
