Although he played for five of the next six matches, he then lost his place to Jimmy McGowan. Described as a \"constructive inside-right\", his personal best season for the \"Saints\" came in 1952\u201353, when he made 21 appearances, although Southampton ended second from bottom and were relegated to the Third Division. Although Purves played in the opening two matches of the 1953\u201354 season, he was then dropped in favour of Roy Williams; his final Southampton appearance came on 6 March 1954. At the end of the season he was released, having made a total of 36 appearances with four goals for Southampton."]}]}}
