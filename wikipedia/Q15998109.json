The shock of this news had a palpable effect. On 12 September, orders were received from the Admiralty confirming the pay cuts. On the evening of 13 September, by which time sailors had already started agitating, Rear-Admiral Wilfred Tomkinson, in temporary command of the fleet while Admiral Sir Michael Hodges was in hospital, received a letter from the Admiralty dated 10 September giving the reasons for the reduction in pay and the principles on which it had been based. The following morning, Tomkinson ordered the commanders of all ships present to read sections of the letter to their officers and crew. However, several ships had not received copies of the letter and some were unable to pass the information on to their companies until the next day. By that time, the mood for a mutiny had taken hold in many crews."]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Sir Michael Hodges, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Michael Hodges, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Michael Hodges, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Michael Hodges, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Michael Hodges, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Michael Hodges, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Michael Hodges, Second Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)", "response": ["|6 ||Vice-Admiral || 25px ||Sir Michael Hodges ||27 May 1930 \u2013 6 October 1931"]}, {"page": "1st Battle Squadron", "response": ["* Vice-Admiral Sir Michael Hodges (1926\u201327)"]}, {"page": "3rd Battle Squadron", "response": ["* Vice-Admiral Sir Michael Hodges April (1925\u201326)"]}, {"page": "Naval Secretary", "response": ["* 1923 \u2013 1925 Vice-Admiral Michael Hodges"]}, {"page": "Michael Hodges", "response": ["Michael Hodges may refer to:", "* Michael Hodges (Royal Navy officer) (1874\u20131951)", "* Michael Hodges (writer) (born 1976), American speculative fiction writer", "* Michael Hodges (producer), American singer-songwriter, record producer and music executive", "* Michael Hodges (American football) (born 1986), American football coach"]}]}}
