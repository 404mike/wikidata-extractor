Bensusan", "response": ["In 1906, Bensusan cemented his connection with the county by acquiring a 50 acre farm near Great Easton, not far from Easton Lodge the home of Lord and Lady Warwick. Near neighbours also included H. G. Wells, Thomas Hardy and R. D. Blumenfeld (editor of the Daily Express) and Gustav Holst who lived for a time at Thaxted and developed an interest in folksong there. Bensusan was in contact, not only with these luminaries, but many others as is evident in letters to people such as Rudyard Kipling, Adrian Bell, Sidney Olivier and others who had an interest in land use, agriculture and country issues. In 1909 he married Marian Lallah Prichard. Being close to the Essex home of the Countess of Warwick, the Bensusans were part of the social scene associated with that lady including the theatrical, agrarian and horticultural interests she also had in common with Bensusan. Bensusan was said to be the ghost writer of some of the Countess's books. He was to write at least 25 books on agricultural matters and was briefly employed in the press department of the Board of Agriculture between 1919 and 1921. Bensusan developed an interest in recording the local East Anglian dialects and incorporated such diction in some of the plays and novels he wrote, for example, Joan Winter (1933), Right Forward Folk (1949) and Marshland Voices (1955)."]}, {"page": "Frederick Morton Eden (cricketer)", "response": ["After graduating from Oxford, Eden was commissioned into the Oxfordshire Militia as a lieutenant in February 1853.
