He impressed manager Rob Page, who praised his organisation skills and fitness levels. His consistency meant that he went on to establish himself as the established centre-back alongside one of Inniss, Streete and McGivern.

He was nominated for the League One Manager of the Month award in November following a sequence of three wins out of four which moved Vale to the fringes of the promotion race.

He retained his position however, and was named as Football League manager of the week after his side overcame a 2\u20130 half-time deficit to beat Peterborough United 3\u20132 on 12 March.

Brown emphasized that Bikey was still recovering fitness from a quadriceps injury and that there was no timescale on how soon he would be able to play for the first team.

In search of a first clean sheet of the season, Page signed 19-year-old centre-back Remie Streete on loan from Newcastle United. Vale came out of the relegation zone on 11 October with a convincing 4\u20131 win over struggling Yeovil Town. A 2\u20130 defeat followed at Deepdale, with Zubar receiving a straight red card for lashing out at Preston North End's Joe Garner. After the game Page condemned Garner for play-acting throughout the match to try and get Vale player's sent off. The loan signings continued, as Leicester City's Saint Kitts and Nevis international striker Harry Panayiotou arrived on a one-month loan. The club were also in talks with former Premier League midfielder Isaiah Osbourne, who instead joined fellow relegation battlers Scunthorpe United. Ironically a few days later Scunthorpe then came to Burslem, as did the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo, and the game ended 2\u20132 despite the Vale leading 2\u20131 and facing ten men after former player Jennison Myrie-Williams was sent off. The fifth signing of Page's reign then arrived in the form of French striker Dany N'Guessan, who signed a two-month deal. The signing came in good time as Tom Pope was later ruled out of action for a few weeks with a knee injury. Vale then beat Leyton Orient 3\u20130, keeping their first clean sheet of the season; Orient were reduced to ten men early in the first half after Darius Henderson was sent-off for elbowing Richard Duffy.

Page further strengthened the defence and midfield by signing Walsall right-back Ben Purkiss and Crewe Alexandra defensive midfielder Anthony Grant. Page needed to find a cost-effective forward with the club both short on strikers following the departure of Tom Pope and Ben Williamson and with little funds available due to a large cut to the wage bill, and so brought in young Watford striker Uche Ikpeazu on loan, having been impressed by Ikpeazu's performances for Crewe last season. Another former Crewe favourite, A-Jay Leitch-Smith, was also signed after impressing Page during pre-season. The eighth and final summer signing was Ryan Inniss, who was confirmed as joining on a season long loan from Crystal Palace after being linked with a return to Vale Park for many weeks.
