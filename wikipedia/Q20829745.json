He played in Norwich's opening six league games, getting his second goal for the club in a 4\u20133 defeat against West Bromwich Albion; however, he was then injured in training. During his absence, Klose and Zimmermann established themselves at centre-back, with Ben Godfrey also becoming a regular choice, and Hanley was restricted to a few appearances as substitute on his return. When he finally started a game, an FA Cup tie against Portsmouth, he was sent off in the first fifteen minutes for a professional foul on Ronan Curtis and Norwich went on to lose 1\u20130. Despite his lack of game time, Hanley remained club captain as Norwich gained promotion to the Premier League.
