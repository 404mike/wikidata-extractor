His honours at United include four Premier League titles, three FA Cup's, the League Cup, the European Cup Winners Cup, the European Super Cup and five Charity Shields. He is perhaps best known for his partnership at centre half with Steve Bruce. He also had several spells with Middlesbrough that yielded over 200 appearances combined over both periods, as well as briefly playing on loan with Darlington in 1985. He was capped 22 times by England  between 1988 and 1996, as well as nine caps for the England B team.\nFollowing his retirement, Pallister has worked in the media and has appeared as a television pundit for both BBC Sport and ITV Sport, with notable appearances on Football Focus and Final Score.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 30", "response": ["*  1965   \u2013 Gary Pallister, English footballer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Alex Ferguson", "response": ["For the 1989\u201390 season, Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders Neil Webb, Mike Phelan, and Paul Ince, as well as defender Gary Pallister and winger Danny Wallace. The season began well with a 4\u20131 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5\u20131 away defeat against fierce rivals Manchester City. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, \"Three years of excuses and it's still crap\u00a0... ta-ra Fergie.\" was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked. Ferguson later described December 1989 as \"the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game\", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["Over the next two seasons, Middlesbrough gained successive promotions into Division Two and then into Division One. The next season, however, they came straight back down to Division Two, and with it came the then British transfer record move of Gary Pallister to Manchester United for \u00a32.3\u00a0million.

The team only finished in mid-table in the following season, prompting manager Alex Ferguson to bring in several new players, including Gary Pallister, who joined the club in August 1989 from Middlesbrough.Ponting (2000), p. 193. His partnership with Bruce in the centre of defence was described in 2006 by the then-United captain, Gary Neville, as the best in the club's history. \"Dolly and Daisy\", as the pair were affectionately known, are described as \"arguably the best\" on the official Manchester United website.

Taylor made wholesale changes of personnel and tactics, which again drew criticism, his actions considered risky in what was now a crucial game. Lee Sharpe and Lee Dixon came on as wing-backs, while Carlton Palmer and Platt occupied midfield berths. Gascoigne supported Teddy Sheringham and Les Ferdinand up-front.
