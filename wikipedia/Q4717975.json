Their recording contract was signed in the spring of 1964 with Ridgepride, which then leased their recordings to Decca. They released a single, \"Steal Your Heart Away\", that year which failed to chart. They also appeared on the cult TV programme Ready Steady Go! singing the uptempo 'B' side \"Lose Your Money (But Don't Lose your Mind)\". But it was their second single, \"Go Now\" (released later that year), that launched their career, being promoted on TV with one of the first purpose-made promotional films in the pop era, produced and directed by Alex Wharton. The single became a hit in Britain (where it remains their only No. 1 single) and in the United States, where it reached No. 10. The band encountered management problems after the chart-topping hit and subsequently signed to Decca Records in the UK (London Records in the US) directly as recording artists. A four-track extended play release titled \"The Moody Blues\" featuring both sides of their first two Decca singles was issued in a colour picture sleeve in early 1965.", "Alex Wharton left the management firm, and the group released a series of relatively unsuccessful singles. They enjoyed a minor British hit with a cover of \"I Don't Want To Go on Without You\" (No. 33) in February 1965, while the Pinder-Laine original \"From the Bottom of My Heart (I Love You)\" produced by Denny Cordell (with a vocal choral sound towards the conclusion that anticipated their sound on \"Nights in White Satin\") was issued as a UK single in May 1965 and did a little better (No. 22). But then \"Everyday\", another Pinder-Laine song, stalled at No. 44 in October 1965 and no further British singles were released for about a year. The group was still in demand for live gigs, though, and they had chart success in the US and in Europe during those months when \"Bye Bye Bird\" (Decca AT 15048) was lifted from their album in December 1965 as an overseas single in France (No. 3)."]}, {"page": "Ken Dodd", "response": ["Dodd had many hit records, charting on 18 occasions in the UK Top 40, including his first single \"Love Is Like a Violin\" (1960), produced on Decca Records by Alex Wharton, which charted at number 8 (UK).
