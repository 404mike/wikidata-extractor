Sir Henry Wade, who had served as a military surgeon in both the Boer War and the First World War, had been appointed surgical director of the Emergency Medical Service in Scotland and in that capacity was in charge of recruiting staff. When the anticipated war casualties did not materialise, the beds were used for civilian patients on the surgical waiting lists of Edinburgh hospitals. Patients with tuberculosis (TB) were transferred from elsewhere in south-east Scotland under the care of Professor Charles Cameron, and a ward block was designated for patients with bone and joint TB under the care of Mr (later Sir) Walter Mercer, who paid weekly visits to the hospital. A neurosurgical unit was set up in Bangour Military Hospital with a convalescent unit in the annexe. It was headed by Professor Norman Dott, who continued to operate there until the neurosurgical service transferred to a custom-built unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. A maxillo-facial unit and a plastic surgery and burns unit were established in T block. The lead surgeon in plastic surgery and burns was Mr A B Wallace, who had trained under Sir Harold Gillies, and Gillies as consultant plastic surgeon to the army was a regular visitor to the unit. Wallace spent his working life at Bangour and there devised the Wallace rule of nines, which he published in 1951. It is a method used to estimate the surface area involved in a burned patient and guide the volume of fluid replacement required. This work and work on the management of burns by exposure gained an international reputation for the unit.", "*Professor Walter Mercer, Orthopaedic surgeon"]}, {"page": "1956 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Walter Mercer, , Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Edinburgh.
