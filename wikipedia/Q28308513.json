Retrieved November 7, 2018. One section in that directory is devoted specifically to \"Scenario Editors and Writers\". Although male employees and contracted writers comprise the great majority of entries in that section, 30 of Ainsworth's female colleagues are profiled in the reference as screenwriters for various studios. Her colleagues cited in the directory include Hettie Grey Baker, Emma Bell, Nell B. Bronson, Elsie M. Callaghan, Francis Worcester Doughty, Marion Fairfax, Mary Edith Grant, Grace T.
