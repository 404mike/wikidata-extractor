The house was re-orientated to move the front entrance to the north side of the house.  The architecture of the north front had previously been \"simple and dignified\", but it was enhanced to make its appearance more impressive.  The alterations included adding rustication to the bottom storey and around the central window, and quoins to the three projecting central bays.  The arms of the 2nd\u00a0baron were added to the previously blank pediment, and in 1915 a small porch was built over the new entrance.  The south portico had become redundant, other than serving as an entrance to the garden.  The new entrance led by way of a small lobby to a new staircase up to a new entrance hall on the first floor.  A new dining room was created in the northeast corner."]}, {"page": "Seymour Bathurst, 7th Earl Bathurst", "response": ["Bathurst was the son of Allen Bathurst, 6th Earl Bathurst and Meriel Leicester Warren.

In the 19th\u00a0century, when under the care of George Warren, 2nd Baron de Tabley (1811\u201387), its structural condition was maintained, and it continued to be furnished with old furniture.  Retired employees of the family lived in the house, and kept an eye on the family's children who used it as a playhouse.  Following the weddings of two of Lord de\u00a0Tabley's daughters in the 1860s, celebratory balls were held in the hall.  When the Cheshire Yeomanry met on the estate, the officers dined in the new house, while the other ranks used the old hall.  The old hall was also used to host tours demonstrating the history of the family.  From the 1870s, Lord de\u00a0Tabley kept his collection of historical objects and curiosities in the great hall, creating it into a museum.  He also used the old hall as a lending library for local residents.  His heir, John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley (1835\u201395), lived for most of the time in London rather than at Tabley, and visited only occasionally.  His employees continued to live in the old hall, and he dined there each year at the time of the annual audit.  He allowed the general public to walk through the grounds if they attended services at the chapel, and also gave permission for groups and organisations to use the hall for meetings and events.  When Lord de\u00a0Tabley's sister, Eleanor, Lady Leighton Warren (1841\u20131914) inherited the estate, she did not continue this custom.  Wishing for more privacy, she closed the park to public access, and greatly reduced the number of visitors to the old hall."]}, {"page": "John Leicester, 1st Baron de Tabley", "response": ["Leicester married, on 9 November 1810, she aged 16, Georgiana Maria, youngest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Josiah Cottin, and a noted beauty.
