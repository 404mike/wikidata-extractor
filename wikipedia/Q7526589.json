He soon began work on a new and more impressive seat for the family: Teddesley Hall, north-west of Penkridge, on Teddesley Hay.VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5: 23: s.2: The Hay This was built on the site of Teddesley Lodge, a smaller house that had earlier accommodated junior members of the Littleton family. It was said that the finance came from large hoards of coins discovered behind panels at Pillaton Hall, which raised the vast sum of \u00a315,000 on sale. The new house was large but austere, a three-storied, square, brick structure, with seven windows on the upper storeys on all four faces. The main building was linked by curved screen walls to flanking ranges, one housing stables, the other kitchens, stores and servants' rooms."]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Littleton, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["*Fisher Littleton \u2013 father of Sir Edward Littleton, 4th Baronet"]}, {"page": "Lyttelton family", "response": ["*Sir Edward Littleton, 4th Baronet (1727\u20131812)"]}]}}
