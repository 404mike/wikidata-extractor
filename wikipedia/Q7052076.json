He was awarded the Organ Scholarship at Merton College, Oxford, but never completed his degree after being sent down, on his own admission, for not doing enough work. He was appointed Assistant Organist at Manchester Cathedral in 1920, becoming Organist there in 1943, and later held appointments in various churches and cinemas in the city.\nCocker was also an amateur magician.\nNorman Cocker is today remembered mainly for his 'Tuba Tune' (1922).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cocker", "response": ["*Norman Cocker (1889\u20131953), English organist and composer for the organ"]}, {"page": "Plaza Cinema, Stockport", "response": ["The Compton organ is a three manual instrument with a unique 150 stop tab layout which was designed for the Plaza and her sister cinema by Norman Cocker the resident organist from Manchester Cathedral and Arthur Ward one of the original Directors of the Stockport Plaza. It has in addition 42 toe and thumb pistons. There are 11 ranks of pipes situated in 2 chambers, one over the other to the right of the stage. These are concealed behind the decorative grill in the wall. There is no electric amplification, as the sound is produced acoustically straight from the organ pipes. The console is on a lift so that it can rise out of the floor, adding to the theatrical effect. As there is no amplification the organist controls the volume using swell pedals that operate shutters in the grill. It was played before shows, and during silent movies, variety acts and musical interludes between films. The organ can supply a large  range of effects from sleigh bells to aircraft and sea sounds."]}, {"page": "List of musicians at English cathedrals", "response": ["*1943 Norman Cocker", "*1920\u20131922 Norman Cocker (also 1923\u20131943, afterwards organist here)"]}]}}
