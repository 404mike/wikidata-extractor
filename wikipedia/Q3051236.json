The earliest theatrical reference to Knepp is from 1664, as being intended by Thomas Killigrew to play the part of Lusetta in his play Thomaso. This means that she was probably in his troupe, the King's Company, by that  time. From 1666 onwards she is recorded as playing many parts, both tragic and comic, including Lady Fidget in William Wycherley's The Country Wife. In 1664, she became the first woman to perform the title role in Jonson's Epicoene. She also occasionally spoke prologues and epilogues, and often danced and sang in or between acts.\nKnepp's husband was reputedly \"ill-natured\" and treated her badly. Samuel Pepys was fascinated by Knepp, and his diary for 1666\u201468 is full of references to her, including mentions of amorous encounters, and descriptions of how much he enjoyed her flirtatiousness and especially her singing. In the late 1670s she became mistress to the actor Joseph Haines, and died in 1681 giving birth to his stillborn child.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Country Wife", "response": ["John Harold Wilson argues that the famously virile stage presence of Hart as Horner must be taken into account when interpreting the play. As personified by Hart, Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as \"the old-fashioned way\", by being \"dangerously attractive\", and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless.Wilson. Harcourt/Kynaston, although by 1675 a well-regarded and skilful actor of male roles, would clearly have been overshadowed by Horner/Hart. The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true-love plot. Horner's primary mistress Lady Fidget, spokeswoman for \"the virtuous gang\" of secretly sex-hungry town wives, was played by the dynamic Elizabeth Knepp, who Samuel Pepys declared \"the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest I've ever heard\", talents that the famous drinking scene in Horner's lodging seems designed to do justice to. By contrast, the choice of the bit-part actress Elizabeth James as Alithea would have de-emphasised the Harcourt-Alithea plot. Such historical considerations have made modern critics sceptical of Norman Holland's classic 1959 \"right way/wrong way\" interpretation of the play, which positions the true-love plot as the most important one."]}, {"page": "Barbara Allen (song)", "response": ["From this, Steve Roud and Julia Bishop have inferred the song was popular at that time, suggesting that it may have been written for stage performance, as Elizabeth Knepp was a professional actress, singer, and dancer. However, the folklorists Phillips Barry and Fannie Hardy Eckstorm were of the opinion that the song \"was not a stage song at all but a libel on Barbara Villiers and her relations with Charles II\". Charles Seeger points out that Pepys' delight at hearing a libelous song about the King's mistress was perfectly in character."]}, {"page": "List of women who died in childbirth", "response": ["*Elizabeth Knepp (1681), actress"]}, {"page": "Epic\u0153ne, or The Silent Woman", "response": ["In 1664, Pepys saw the play at the Theatre Royal with Elizabeth Knepp in the title role; this was probably the first performance in which a woman played Epic\u0153ne. Over the next century, a number of celebrated actresses, including Anne Oldfield and Sarah Siddons, performed the part. Siddons, however, was directly associated with the play's departure from the stage. David Garrick and George Colman's updated version (1752), featuring Siddons, was a disastrous failure. Bonnell Tyler, echoing Reformation comments on the play, condemned Morose as ludicrously unnatural, and other reviewers were no kinder. Garrick replaced Siddons with a boy, responding to ill-informed complaints that a female Epic\u0153ne was ludicrous. The revamped casting did not save the production, and Epic\u0153ne vanished from the boards for over a century, a victim of the falling popularity of non-Shakespearean Renaissance dramas."]}, {"page": "1681 in England", "response": ["* Elizabeth Knepp, actress (year of birth unknown)"]}, {"page": "The Sparagus Garden", "response": ["Consistent with this topicality, Brome's play referred to an actual London asparagus garden; it was located on  in Lambeth Marsh near Waterloo \u2014 a narrow piece of land running up from the River Thames, roughly opposite the Whitehall Stairs.Henry B.
