She is an associate editor of Gardens Illustrated magazine, has written for The Observer for some twenty years, and contributed to Country Life, Country Living and Elle Decoration. Besides gardening her interests include sailing, black and white films, Evelyn Waugh and the rainforests of Central America.\nPavord was born in Abergavenny, the daughter of headmaster Arthur Pavord and teacher Christabel Lewis. She now lives in Puncknowle in south-west England. She attended the University of Leicester and graduated in 1962 with a B.A.(honours) degree in English. Not aligned with any political party, her religious views are those of a Pantheist. She married Trevor Ware on 18 June 1966 and has three daughters, Oenone, Vanessa and Tilly.\n\"The Rectory\", her rural garden in Dorset, has been both a healing influence and source of inspiration for more than thirty years. She took up writing about gardening in order to finance the revamping of the building and garden.\nThe one and a half acres of garden of this 300-year-old estate in Dorset was used as a nursery for her ideas on horticulture. In the beginning the garden was overgrown and the building dilapidated. It was here that she first planted tulips, and intrigued by their beauty, planted many thousands more.\n\n\"The soul needs to look out at things and find rest and peace and beauty in the things that the eyes are seeing. I think that\u2019s a need. It\u2019s a need as much as having a roof over your head and food in your stomach\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 20", "response": ["*  1940   \u2013 Anna Pavord, Welsh-English journalist and author"]}, {"page": "Conrad Gessner", "response": ["Gessner has been described as the father of modern scientific botany and zoology, and the father of modern bibliography. To his contemporaries he was best known as a botanist. Despite his traveling ways and the job of maintaining his own gardens, Gesner probably spent most of his time inside his own extensive library. He listed among his History of Animals sources more than 80 Greek authors and at least 175 Latin authors, as well as works by German, French, and Italian authors. He even attempted to establish a \"universal library\" of all books in existence. The project might sound strange to the modern mind, but Gessner invested tremendous energy in the project. He sniffed through remote libraries along with the collections of the Vatican Library and catalogs of printers and booksellers. By assembling this universal library of information, Gessner put together a database centuries before computers would ease such work. He cut relevant passages out of books, grouped the cuttings by general theme, subdivided the groups into more specific categories, and boxed them. He could then retrieve and arrange the cuttings as needed. In the words of science writer Anna Pavord, \"He was a one-man search engine, a 16th-century Google with the added bonus of critical evaluation.\""]}, {"page": "John Gerard", "response": ["According to Anna Pavord, Gerard was a doer and not a scholar. Deborah Harkness notes that Gerard was not part of the community of Lime Street naturalists in London at the time. His flawed (from the perspective of some of his contemporaries) Herball is dedicated to Burghley. He surrounded himself with influential friends and contacts, including Lancelot Browne, George Baker, and the apothecaries James Garrett, Hugh Morgan and Richard Garth. Garret was a Huguenot living and working in London, and a neighbour of L'Obel. Many of these had fine gardens and would exchange plants. Garth, who described Gerard as \"a worshipful gentleman and one that greatly delighteth in strange plants\" had South American contacts from where he would import rarities. He also exchanged plants with Clusius and cultivated a certain \"Captain Nicholas Cleet of the Turky Company\" from whom he obtained specimens from the Middle East. He would also visit other collectors and nurserymen such as Richard Pointer of Twickenham, Master Fowle, keeper of the Queen's house at St. James and Master Huggens, keeper of the garden at Hampton Court. His servant, William Marshall travelled to the Mediterranean on his behalf and Jean Robin, the French king's gardener sent him seeds. After his death in February 1612 he was buried at the parish church of St Andrews, Holborn."]}, {"page": "\u00c9lie-Abel Carri\u00e8re", "response": ["In 1880, he described Iris orchioides.Anna Pavord"]}, {"page": "Felix Platter", "response": ["Returning to Basel in 1557, Platter soon established himself as a successful physician and became professor of practical medicine at the University of Basel, amassing a famous collection of curiosities at his house as well as an enormous library of pressed plant specimens.The Naming of Names by Anna Pavord (Bloomsbury, 2005)."]}, {"page": "1940 in Wales", "response": ["*20 September - Anna Pavord, gardening writer"]}, {"page": "Fritillaria uva-vulpis", "response": ["Fritillaria uva-vulpis is a bulbous perennial plant belonging to the genus Fritillaria and native to eastern Turkey, north-western Iraq and western Iran.\"Botanica.
