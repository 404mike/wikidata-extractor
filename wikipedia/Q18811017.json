The club was still seeking a winning formula, after generally poor league placings from previous managers Fred Halliday and Archie Mitchell. The directors of the club cleared the decks and retained just 9 of the previous season's squad.

Brentford went on to have their best season at that time in the Football League, ending 1929 in second place and ascending to the top of the Third Division South on 25 January 1930. The good results were due to a consistently fit starting XI, which went unchanged for 21 consecutive matches in all competitions between 2 November 1929 and 15 March 1930, a club record. Top spot was held onto until a 0\u20130 draw with Exeter City on 29 March saw Plymouth Argyle overtake the Bees and automatic promotion was effectively conceded after successive defeats in mid-April.

The visitors took an advantage, as Stephen Dearn and Willie Haines put Pompey 2\u20131 up, with Bill Rawlings scoring in between the goals for the hosts. After losing Sammy Meston and Tom Parker, the Saints went 3\u20131 down thanks to a second goal from Haines, before Rawlings scored a second as well. Pompey made it three wins out of three against Southampton two days later, when they also beat them at Fratton Park to win the Hampshire Benevolent Cup. William Beedie scored early to give the advantage to the hosts, who dominated the remainder of the game and scored a second through Haines on 60 minutes."]}]}}
