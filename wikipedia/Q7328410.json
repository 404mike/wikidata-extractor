Nicholson still hoisted his flag aboard her, although he was now commander of the Reserve Fleet there. Nicholson hauled down his flag on 1 April 1920 and the ship was transferred back to Portsmouth by 14 September. Orion then became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet, which was commanded by Vice-Admiral Richard Phillimore. In June 1921 she became a gunnery training ship at Portland. On 12 April 1922, she was paid off and placed on the disposal list in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. On 19 December Orion was sold for scrap to Cox and Danks and she arrived at Upnor in February 1923 to begin demolition."]}, {"page": "Second Battle of Heligoland Bight", "response": ["1st Battle Cruiser Squadron (detachment: Rear Admiral Richard Phillimore CB, MVO)"]}, {"page": "Tondern raid", "response": ["In March 1918 the battlecuiser  joined the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow, flying the flag of the Rear Admiral Commanding Aircraft, Richard Phillimore.

In late 1917 a second flight deck was fitted aft, landing on which proved \"almost as hazardous as ditching in the sea\".
