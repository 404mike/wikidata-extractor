Ralph became a silversmith, jeweller, and seal-engraver under his father and elder brothers Richard and William junior. In addition, he became a copper engraver to meet the demand of the then North England market. His plate \"Thornton's Monument\" in John Brand's History of Newcastle shows his craftsmanship in that field. In 1767 Thomas Bewick was apprenticed to him. They became partners 10 years later.The texts in Bewick's A General History of Quadrupeds (1790) and History of British Birds: Land Birds (1797) were drafted by Beilby and revised by Bewick. According to Bewick's account, Beilby wanted to have his name appear in Land Birds as the sole author; however, upon Bewick's disagreement, neither of them was named as the author. The partnership came to an end in 1797, after the publication of Land Birds. They were tentatively reconciled in 1800, co-operating again for some projects, including the publication of Figures of British Land Birds. Bewick came to Beilby's defense when the latter had been defamed in a supplement to the third edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica published in 1801.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Bewick", "response": ["His career began when he was apprenticed to engraver Ralph Beilby in Newcastle upon Tyne. He became a partner in the business and eventually took it over. Apprentices whom Bewick trained include John Anderson, Luke Clennell, and William Harvey, who in their turn became well known as painters and engravers.", "Bewick did not flourish at schoolwork,Uglow, 2006. pp. 12\u201313. but at a very early age showed a talent for drawing. He had no lessons in art. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to Ralph Beilby, an engraver in Newcastle, where he learnt how to engrave on wood and metal, for example marking jewellery and cutlery with family names and coats of arms.Uglow, 2006. pp. 39\u201344. In Beilby's workshop Bewick engraved a series of diagrams on wood for Charles Hutton, illustrating a treatise on measurement.Uglow, 2006. pp. 47\u201348. He seems thereafter to have devoted himself entirely to engraving on wood, and in 1775 he received a prize from the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce for a wood engraving of the \"Huntsman and the Old Hound\" from Select Fables by the late Mr Gay, which he was illustrating.Uglow, 2006. p. 92."]}, {"page": "Cur", "response": ["In England the cur, also called the drover's dog, was a distinct breed of dog used by cattle drovers; they are now extinct. The cur was described by Ralph Beilby and Thomas Bewick in their 1790 work A general history of quadrupeds, as well as by Sydenham Edwards in his 1800 Cynographia Britannica, as dogs principally used by drovers to drive cattle. Curs were described as heelers, nipping the heels of cattle to make them move and ducking below the subsequent kick, they were said to be common in England, particularly the North of England, but were virtually unknown in the rest of the United Kingdom."]}, {"page": "Beilby", "response": ["*Ralph Beilby (1744\u20131817), English engraver working chiefly on silver and copper"]}, {"page": "Avison Ensemble", "response": ["Avison wrote more than eighty concertos, which drew the great musicians of the day to perform in Newcastle. He worked with figures such as the astronomer William Herschel who was leader of Avison's orchestra, the composer William Shield (his pupil from Whickham and to whom is owed the memory of Auld Lang Syne), the Newcastle glass enameller Ralph Beilby who was a bass player in Avison's orchestra, and the English wood engraver Thomas Bewick, who as a young lad engraved the concert tickets."]}, {"page": "A History of British Birds", "response": ["A History of British Birds is a natural history book by Thomas Bewick, published in two volumes. Volume 1, Land Birds, appeared in 1797. Volume 2, Water Birds, appeared in 1804. A supplement was published in 1821. The text in Land Birds was written by Ralph Beilby, while Bewick took over the text for the second volume. The book is admired mainly for the beauty and clarity of Bewick's wood-engravings, which are widely considered his finest work, and among the finest in that medium.", "British Birds, reviewing a \"lavishly illustrated\" British Library book on Bewick, writes that \"No ornithologist will ever regard Thomas Bewick, known primarily for The History of British Birds (1797\u20131804), as a naturalist of the same standing as contemporaries such as Edward Donovan, John Latham and James Bolton\", noting however that Bewick helped to define \"a certain English Romantic sensibility\". More directly, the review notes that \"Bewick was aware that his role was to offer a modest guide to birds that the common man not only could afford but would also want to possess.\" Bewick was not \"a scientist, but he was a perfectionist\". The book's text was written by \"failed author\" Ralph Beilby, but the text is \"almost extraneous\" given Bewick's masterpiece."]}, {"page": "Robert Johnson (artist)", "response": ["Born at Shotley Bridge, near Ovingham, Northumberland, he was son of a joiner and carpenter, who shortly afterwards removed to Gateshead. Through his mother, who was acquainted with Thomas Bewick, Johnson was in 1788 apprenticed to Ralph Beilby and Bewick in Newcastle, to learn copperplate-engraving. Johnson mainly occupied himself in sketching from nature in water-colours. On the expiration of his apprenticeship, he abandoned engraving, and took up painting."]}]}}
