Together, they later joined the Provisional IRA. The gang spent the late 1970s on the run, carrying out operations and evading both the British Army and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. The latter force arrested McGlinchey in the Republic of Ireland in 1977. He was convicted of hijacking a police vehicle and threatening officers with a gun. In 1982, while serving his sentence in Portlaoise Prison, he clashed with the prison's IRA leadership and was either expelled by them for indiscipline or left the due to strategic differences.", "In August 1971 the British army launched Operation Demetrius, which involved the mass arrest and of 342 people suspected of being involved with the IRA. McGlinchey was one of those interned as a result, interrupting his fledgeling career as a car mechanic. He spent five days being interrogated in Shackleton Barracks; like his fellow internees, he had no access to either family or legal representation. He was then transferred to Magilligan Prison, and later Long Kesh. There he met IRA veterans from the Border campaign, some of whom ran classes in left-wing politics\u2014based on the writings of Marx and James Connolly\u2014as well as military tactics. One man imprisoned with McGlinchey later recalled him as \"a big kid out of his depth\" who possessed only a limited knowledge of republican history and ideology. Released in either May or June 1972, his experience appears to have been the catalyst for him to join the physical force movement. that  Coming from a deeply republican area\u2014the failed Border Campaign still a fresh memory\u2014his background gave him \"first-class\" republican credentials. For those intending to follow such a path, there was still a choice to be had between joining the Official or the Provisional IRAs; McGlinchey chose neither. Instead, he joined with Francis Hughes\u2014a childhood friend\u2014Ian Milne and Tom McElwee, and together they formed their own informal unit. McGlinchey later explained their rationale for doing so during what he called \"that colourful period\": \"You meet fellows who now say they had a political philosophy but they had not. You just went out and did it. When I was doing that at the start. I had no idea I was reacting against the State.\"", "Dermot Finucane, brother of murdered Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane, later told the investigative author Kevin Toolis that the \"Wanted\" posters put up about McGlinchey and Hughes influenced him to join the IRA in 1978. Finucane told Toolis how \"I remember seeing Dominic McGlinchey and Ian Milne and Francis Hughes 'Wanted' posters when they were on the run as the most wanted men in Ulster, and I remember mentally saying: 'That is what you want, you want to inflict so much damage on the enemy they want you badly'\". McGlinchey was commemorated in the INLA wing of the Maze Prison with a mural on a communal wall. McGlinchey is portrayed in a black beret and against a fiery background and a silhouetted hillside. The caption read \"Comrade Dominic McGlinchey. Proudly remembered by the INLA POWs. Long Kesh\". Similarly, the scholar Paul K. Clare said that, while researching public opinion in Northern Ireland, he asked a group of young men in Turf Lodge \"if there was any one individual who they admired more than anyone else. 'Mad Dog' McGlinchey\" was their reply.\" Such views, argues Clare, were \"not so uncommon that they would be considered abnormal\"."]}, {"page": "Francis Hughes", "response": ["Hughes initially joined the Official Irish Republican Army, but left after the organisation declared a ceasefire in May 1972.Ten Men Dead, p. 115.
