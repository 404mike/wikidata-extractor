Under his leadership, Brown pledged to take Bermuda to the next level and to \"lead Bermuda to greater health, happiness and prosperity for all of its people\".", "Following the PLP's second general election victory on 23 July 2003, Brown and ten PLP MPs refused to support PLP Leader Jennifer Smith as premier. She resigned on 28 July 2003, and following a special leadership conference of the PLP, William Alexander Scott was elected as leader of the party and premier. Brown was elected as Deputy Leader of Party and Deputy Premier of Bermuda. Responding to criticism that the leadership challenge was launched after the voters had already gone to the polls, Brown responded, \"We had to mislead you.\" A compromise between the factions of the party led to Smith being replaced by William Alexander Scott and Brown being named Deputy Premier, and later adding the Ministry of Tourism to his portfolio."]}]}}
