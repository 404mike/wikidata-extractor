Former sport minister Gerry Sutcliffe talked of previous concern about how the FA dealt with governance of the sport and with youth development (in the 1990s, the FA was said to have reacted \"dismissively\" to worries about sexual abuse in the game, and too slow to implement criminal record checks; in 2003, the FA had scrapped a project meant to ensure children were being protected from sexual abuse; and FA officials had been uncooperative with the review project, with ten of 14 FA staff not replying to interview requests and a report by the researchers of others being \"prevented/bullied\" from talking). Sutcliffe said an independent body, such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should look at the issue rather than the FA investigating itself: \"What I've seen in football over the years is that they're very narrow, very insular, and may not do a proper job even though with the right intentions.\""]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Gerry Sutcliffe", "| Gerry Sutcliffe"]}, {"page": "Gerry", "response": ["* Gerard Gerry Sutcliffe (born 1953), British politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gerry Sutcliffe"]}, {"page": "2012 Summer Paralympics", "response": ["LOCOG faced further criticism for how it handled the sale of tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas was replaced by a dedicated telephone hotline.

Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs."]}, {"page": "Gerard Sutcliffe", "response": ["#redirect Gerry Sutcliffe"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1979\u20132010)", "response": ["|Gerry Sutcliffe"]}, {"page": "Minister for Sport and Civil Society", "response": ["| width=200|Gerry Sutcliffe"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Bradford South || Gerry Sutcliffe || Labour || Gerry Sutcliffe || Labour"]}, {"page": "Bradford South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|1994 by-election || Gerry Sutcliffe || Labour"]}, {"page": "Pitch invasion", "response": ["* West Ham United v Millwall (25 August 2009) Football League Cup.
