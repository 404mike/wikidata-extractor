He was born in South Gloucestershire but is now based in Wiltshire and is associated with the Wiltshire Football Association.He refereed in the Premier League, the top level in the English football league pyramid, since his promotion to the panel of Select Group Referees in 2007. In 2010, he officiated the FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium and in 2014 he took charge of the FA Cup final, the highest refereeing honour in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FA Cup Final referees", "response": ["|2011||Martin Atkinson||Adam WattsSimon Beck||Lee ProbertJake Collin||", "|2014||Lee Probert||Jake CollinMick McDonough||Kevin FriendSimon Bennett||http://www.thefa.com/news/the-fa-cup/2014/apr/final-referee-lee-probert"]}, {"page": "Billy Paynter", "response": ["He opened the 2004\u201305 season by being sent off for over celebrating after scoring Vale's first goal in a 3\u20132 defeat at Walsall on 7 August; he went on to criticize referee Lee Probert for ruining the game with the red card decision. He went on to end the campaign as the club's top-scorer with thirteen goals in fifty games; this came despite criticism from some supporters for a mini-goal drought in mid-season. In March, manager Martin Foyle dismissed rumours of Paynter moving to nearby Crewe Alexandra. At the end of the season, fans voted Paynter as the club's Player of the Year. He started the 2005\u201306 season with just two goals in sixteen League One games, but had still done enough in his Port Vale career to justify a move into Championship football. The club reported Tony Pulis' Plymouth Argyle to The Football Association for an alleged illegal approach for the player, but accepted a bid from Hull City."]}, {"page": "2007 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["*Fourth official: Lee Probert (Wiltshire)"]}, {"page": "Select Group", "response": ["* Lee Probert"]}, {"page": "Lee Probert (referee)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lee Probert"]}, {"page": "2009 Football League Championship play-off Final", "response": ["The referee for the final was Mike Dean of the Wirral District Football Association, with assistant referees Darren Cann and Mick McDonough, and Lee Probert acting as the fourth official.

Blackwell described the appointment as \"inexplicable\" and that he was \"amazed at the stupidity of it.\" He went on to say that he was \"very, very angry about people who run the game not using their common sense and putting Mike Dean in what could be a very embarrassing position\".  Both managers had appeared at the old Wembley Stadium as players: Owen Coyle played, and scored, in Bolton Wanderers' 4\u20133 victory over Reading in the 1995 Football League First Division play-off Final while Blackwell featured for Boston United who lost against Wealdstone in the 1985 FA Trophy Final."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Portsmouth F.C. season", "response": ["|Lee Probert", "|Lee Probert", "|Lee Probert"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["City travelled to Villa Park and thought they had taken the lead through Mama Sidib\u00e9 out-jumped Stephen Warnock but referee Lee Probert gave a free-kick to Villa.
