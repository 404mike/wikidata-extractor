He was known as a hard-working and \"solid defensive midfielder who worked tirelessly to win the ball\" and provide his teammates with possession. He played with Calgary Foothills as a youth before beginning his professional football career in Germany with Bayern Munich. After seven years with the Munich side \u2013 during which time he won four German league titles and the 2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League \u2013 Hargreaves signed for Manchester United in 2007, winning the Premier League and UEFA Champions League in his first season. However, his time at Manchester United was plagued with injuries and he was allowed to leave the club at the end of his contract in June 2011. Hargreaves posted YouTube videos in a bid to convince potential suitors of his fitness, and in August 2011, Manchester City offered a one-year contract to Hargreaves, which he accepted.\nAs a Canadian citizen with a Welsh mother and an English father, Hargreaves was eligible to represent Canada, Wales or England. Hargreaves initially played for Wales, and was capped three times for the Wales under-19 team, but then opted to play for the England under-21 team in 2000 and was capped by the senior squad the following year. He is the only player to have played for England without having previously lived in the United Kingdom, and only the second, after Joe Baker, to have done so without having previously played in the English football league system.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 20", "response": ["*  1981   \u2013 Owen Hargreaves, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1981", "response": ["** Owen Hargreaves, Canadian-born English footballer"]}, {"page": "Alex Ferguson", "response": ["For the 2007\u201308 season, Ferguson made notable signings to reinforce United's first team.
