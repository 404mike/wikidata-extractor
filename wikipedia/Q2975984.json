Carl Meissner, who contributed a section on the Proteaceae in 1856 to the series Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis by Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, recognised twenty-three species, including seven new ones: L. gueinzii, L. mundii, L. reflexum, L. oleaefolium var. brownii (now L.  bolusii), L. zeyheri var. truncatum (now L. truncatum), L. attenuatum var. praemorsum and var. ambiguum (now L. praemorsum and L. erubescens). Otto Kuntze revised the genus in 1891 and called it Leucadendron, a homonym of a name that had already been used by Linnaeus in 1753 for another group of Proteaceae, which have separate sexes and very large bracts. Edwin Percy Phillips newly described L. glabrum and L. muirii in 1910, Spencer Le Marchant Moore portrayed L. saxosum in 1911, while Otto Stapf added L. gerrardii in 1912. In 1912, Phillips and Otto Stapf revised Leucospermum and recognised thirty-one species. Afterwards, Phillips described L. cordatum (1923) and L. patersonii (1928). Robert Harold Compton added L. wittebergense in 1931 and L. catherinae in 1933. This was followed by L. arenarium by Hedley Brian Rycroft in 1959. John Patrick Rourke in 1970 distinguished forty-seven species, eight of which new to science: L. erubescens, L. fulgens, L. innovans, L. pluridens, L. praecox, L. profugum, L. secundifolium and L. utriculosum. He later added the newly discovered L. winteri in 1978, L. hamatum in 1983, and L. harpagonatum in 1994. Rourke erected several sections in 1970, among which Xericola, to which he assigned L. alpinum including a subspecies amoenum, L. obtusum including a subspecies albomontanum, as well as L. secundiflorum. In 1984, he erected a new genus Vexatorella to which he moved these taxa, with the exception of L. secundiflorum, that he included in the section Diastelloidea."]}, {"page": "Nepenthes bicalcarata", "response": ["Nepenthes bicalcarata was formally described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in his 1873 monograph, \"Nepenthaceae\", based on specimens collected by Hugh Low and Odoardo Beccari near the Lawas River in Borneo.

In 1879, Spencer Le Marchant Moore created P. oreogeton, and his type came from Kuandian. A variety with white petals was discovered on Honshu by Tomitaro Makino and named P. obovata var. japonica in 1898, but Hisayoshi Takeda thought it in 1910 deserving to be recognised as its own species, P. japonica. Otto Stapf described P. willmottiae in 1916 based on a specimen from the garden of Miss Willmott, that was raised from seed that had been collected by Ernest Henry Wilson in China. P. vernalis, from Far East Russia (Nikolsk-Ussuria), was described by Karl Mandle in 1921. Nikolai Schipczinsky thought only four species to be present in Russia: P. obovata, P. japonica, P. oreogeton and P. vernalis. F.C. Stern revised this group of names in 1946, and suggested to merge P. oreogeton and P. vernalis with P. obovata, and to reduce P. willmottiae to a variety, but retained P. japonica. Wen-Pei Fang in 1958 disagreed and thought P. willmottiae needed to be retained as a species. Nearly all Japanese authors, such as Jisaburo Ohwi in 1978, thought there were two species in Japan, each with two subtaxa: P. obovata var. obovata and var. glabra, and P. japonica var. japonica and var. pilosa. More recently however, Chinese botanists regarded all these types as belonging to the same species (or conspecific)."]}, {"page": "Grevillea sarissa", "response": ["The species was originally described by botanist  Spencer Le Marchant Moore, his description published in Journal of the Linnean Society in 1899."]}, {"page": "Spencer (given name)", "response": ["*Spencer Le Marchant Moore (1850\u20131931), British botanist"]}]}}
