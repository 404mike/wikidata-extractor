A notable creation in show was the Coil Corset made in collaboration with jeweller Shaun Leane, who also crafted many other pieces for McQueen, including a Spine Corset (Untitled Spring/Summer 1998) and a yashmak in aluminium and crystal (Eye, Spring/Summer 2000).

One of McQueen's most famous pieces was a 1999 aluminium corset, called the Coiled Corset, created in collaboration with the jeweller Shaun Leane and the artist Kees van der Graaf. Built around a cast of the model Laura Morgan's torso, the garment had a  waist and was composed of 97 stacked coils, which had to be screwed together onto Morgan's body. The Coiled Corset was inspired by the neck rings worn by Ndebele women, extended to encase the wearer's torso. In 2001, the corset formed part of a live presentation at the Victoria and Albert Museum showcasing McQueen and Leane's collaborations. Corsets and bustiers can also be made using wire, such as a 1983 aluminium wire bustier by Miyake, which was cuffed around the torso over a feathered garment, offering a pun on the theme of birdcages."]}, {"page": "Shaun Leane", "response": ["* Parliamentary voting record of Shaun Leane at Victorian Parliament Tracker"]}, {"page": "Dress of the Year", "response": [": Shaun Leane (mouthpiece)"]}, {"page": "All the Lovers", "response": ["She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible standing in the middle of a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word \"higher\". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons.

The collection also included corsetry and jewellery designed by Shaun Leane (a habitual member of McQueen\u2019s team). The haute couture milliner, Philip Treacy, also collaborated in this collection designing headpieces resembling alters and skulls. The selected colours for this collection were black (as in many cultures is a symbol of death and mourning) white or bone (symbol of purity) and soft purple or lilac (the colour of Victorian half-mourning). Prints of Victorian classical patterns and McCulin\u2019s pictures were also used in some of the garments. This collection was composed of 82 looks and it was the first time that McQueen would include menswear. Also, several fashion editors concluded that this collection had more wearable pieces than previous McQueen\u2019s collections, making it more accessible to buyers and critics.", "The Show featured several iconic pieces in McQueen\u2019s career.

It was the first time that McQueen used acid-washed denim fabrics; the next time would be in his 1997 Autumn/Winter collection It\u2019s a Jungle Out There. This fabric was associated with the punk and skinhead gangs of the East End. The corset in which Honor Fraser closed the show (a lilac silk customized corset with black lace and extremely long neck) has turned in one of the most iconic McQueen pieces as it introduced architectural aspects in haute couture garments for the first time in McQueen's work. Debra Shaw walked wearing a Victorian bone shirt, a long tale velvet skirt and one of the Witkin\u2019s masks created for the show. This show would mean the first collaboration of McQueen and Kate Moss; she wore an oversized leather jacket, a dress with one of McCullin\u2019s pictures printed on it and a McCullin\u2019s top with a bumster. Several models wore pieces of jewellery and millinery which resembled crucifixes, antlers designed by Shaun Leane and Philip Treacy.
