He obtained both a DA and a Postgraduate Diploma from Glasgow School of Art. He subsequently worked as a freelance industrial designer, during which time he designed a prototype medical ultrasound machine, the Lund machine (aka the Sund\u00e9n machine, after Bertil Sund\u00e9n of Lund University, who commissioned it), and the production version, the Diasonograph, working with medical physicist Tom Brown.He also worked as an artist, specialising in aviation subjects.

He was a member of the academic advisory panel on the development of displays at Glasgow's Riverside Museum, but criticised the final arrangements, saying \"The building itself and its historic setting is splendid, but I think that the exhibition, and the way it has been handled, is a bit dumbed-down. I don\u2019t think the exhibition design is satisfactory at all - it seems to be [more] visual effect than scholarly effort. It seems to me to be an incoherent exhibition.\"He was awarded the Lord Provost of Glasgow's Gold Medal for Education in 1998 and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours, \"for services to Art and Design\". The same year, he was made an honorary Doctor of Science by the University of Strathclyde.
