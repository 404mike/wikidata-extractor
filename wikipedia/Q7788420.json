He was trained as a solicitor, and worked in the law for many years, but his real interest was landscape painting. He married Harriet Hailes of Melton in 1825, and they had two sons and six daughters who survived to adulthood (but none of whom prospered). Thomas was a long-term friend of Edward FitzGerald, the translator of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat.", "link_mentions": {}}}
