In 1728, German physician Georg Ernst Stahl first coined the term \"gastritis\". Italian anatomical pathologist Giovanni Battista Morgagni further described the characteristics of gastric inflammation. He described the characteristics of erosive or ulcerative gastritis and erosive gastritis. Between 1808 and 1831, French physician Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph-Victor Broussais gathered information from the autopsy of the dead French soldiers. He described chronic gastritis as \"Gastritide\" and erroneously believed that gastritis was the cause of ascites, typhoid fever, and meningitis. In 1854, Charles Handfield Jones and Wilson Fox described the microscopic changes of stomach inner lining in gastritis which existed in diffuse and segmental forms. In 1855, Baron Carl von Rokitansky first described hypertrophic gastritis. In 1859, British physician, William Brinton first described about acute, subacute, and chronic gastritis. In 1870, Samuel Fenwick noted that pernicious anemia causes glandular atrophy in gastritis. German surgeon, Georg Ernst Konjetzny noticed that gastric ulcer and gastric cancer are the results of gastric inflammation. Shields Warren and Willam A. Meissner described the intestinal metaplasia of the stomach as a feature of chronic gastritis."]}, {"page": "Edward Henry Sieveking", "response": ["* A Manual of Pathological Anatomy, with Charles Handfield Jones (London, 1854; 2nd ed. 1875)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society J, K, L", "response": ["| Charles Handfield Jones||6 June 1850||1 October 1819 \u2013 30 September 1890 physician"]}, {"page": "Joseph Frank Payne", "response": ["In 1875 Payne edited Charles Handfield Jones and Edward Henry Sieveking's Manual of Pathological Anatomy, and in 1888 published a Manual of General Pathology.
