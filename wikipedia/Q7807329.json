He was first elected at the 1959 general election, and stood down at the 1983 general election.\nKitson was the son of Geoffrey H. and Kathleen Kitson. He was educated at Charterhouse and the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. He farmed in Australia from 1949 to 1951. From 1954 to 1957, he served as a councillor on Thirsk Rural District Council, and from 1957 to 1961 on North Riding County Council. In Parliament, he acted as joint honorary secretary of the Conservative parliamentary committee on agriculture, fisheries and food from 1965 to 1966 and a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Prime Minister Edward Heath from 1970 to 1974.\nIn 1964 and 1965, Kitson supported the Labour MP Sydney Silverman's successful 'Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill'. He opposed abolition in the form finalised in 1969, however. Kitson received a knighthood in Heath's resignation honours list in 1974.The droll side of his personality was caught in an anecdote told by Heath in his autobiography. Heath had friendly relations with the Singapore politician, Lee Kuan Yew ['Harry' Lee]: \"Whenever I have visited Singapore, except for the 1971 Commonwealth Conference, Harry Lee has generously settled me in his personal guest-house, and extended his hospitality to me. His dinners are marked by an invitation card and a menu with 'Smoking is not permitted' heavily printed at the top. Dining with the Lee family one time outside in his garden, I was alarmed when the butler came up to Sir Timothy Kitson, my parliamentary private secretary, and handed him a note. After reading it, Tim apologised to the Prime Minister [Lee Kuan Yew] and asked to be excused while he made a telephone call to London. He returned after some twenty minutes, but half an hour later the same thing happened. Again Tim came back without a word of explanation. When we got up after dinner, I quietly went up to him and said, 'Tim, what was all that about ? Is something wrong ? What is happening in London?' 'I didn't worry you because everything is perfectly all right,' he replied. 'I just had to have a smoke.'\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Heath", "response": ["Thatcher had promised Heath a seat in the Shadow Cabinet and planned to offer him whatever post he wanted. His advisors agreed he should wait at least six months, so he declined. He never relented and his refusal was called \"the incredible sulk\".Moore, Thatcher 1:297\u2013298 Thatcher visited Heath at his home shortly after her election as leader and had to stay for coffee with his PPS Timothy Kitson so the waiting press would not realise how brief the visit had been. Heath claimed that he had simply declined her request for advice about how to handle the press, whilst Thatcher claimed that she offered him any Shadow Cabinet position he wanted and asked him to lead the Conservative campaign in the imminent EEC referendum, only to be rudely rebuffed.Ziegler 2010, pp. 490\u2013491", "In the 1960s, Heath had lived in the Albany, off Piccadilly; at the unexpected end of his premiership, the French couple living there refused his demand that they move out so that he could have his flat back (\"So much for European Unity!\" Heath later wrote in his memoirs). For four months, Heath took the flat of Conservative MP Timothy Kitson; Kitson declined his offer to pay rent but later recalled an occasion when his own watch broke, and Heath in response invited him to take one of a large collection that he had been given on his travels. In July 1974, the Duke of Westminster, a major London landowner and ardent Europhile, allowed Heath to rent a property in Wilton Street, Belgravia, for an annual rent of \u00a31,250 (just under \u00a310,000 at 2014 prices), a tenth of the market value. The house had three storeys and a basement flat for Heath's housekeeper, and he continued to use it as his London home until old age prevented him from climbing the stairs.Ziegler 2010, pp. 443\u2013444"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Private Secretary", "response": ["*Timothy Kitson: to Edward Heath, 1970\u20131974"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Timothy Kitson"]}, {"page": "Royal Agricultural University", "response": ["*Timothy Kitson, former MP"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Timothy Kitson (1931\u20132019), MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire (1959\u20131983)Who's Who 1974, London : A. & C.
