For a time, he served as Picasso's personal therapist. He attended the mouvement Psych\u00e9 that Maryse Choisy founded and published in the Surrealist journal Minotaure. \"[Lacan's] interest in surrealism predated his interest in psychoanalysis,\" former Lacanian analyst and biographer Dylan Evans explains, speculating that \"perhaps Lacan never really abandoned his early surrealist sympathies, its neo-Romantic view of madness as 'convulsive beauty', its celebration of irrationality.\"Evans, Dylan, \"\"From Lacan to Darwin\" \", in The Literary Animal; Evolution and the Nature of Narrative, eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2005 Translator and historian David Macey writes that \"the importance of surrealism can hardly be over-stated... to the young Lacan... [who] also shared the surrealists' taste for scandal and provocation, and viewed provocation as an important element in psycho-analysis itself\".David Macey, \"Introduction\" in Jacques Lacan (1994) The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis, London:Penuin Books, pp. xv-xvi", "Andr\u00e9 Green objected that \"when you read Freud, it is obvious that this proposition doesn't work for a minute. Freud very clearly opposes the unconscious (which he says is constituted by thing-presentations and nothing else) to the pre-conscious. What is related to language can only belong to the pre-conscious\". Freud certainly contrasted \"the presentation of the word and the presentation of the thing... the unconscious presentation is the presentation of the thing alone\"Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (Penguin 1984) p. 207 in his metapsychology. Dylan Evans, however, in his Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis, \"... takes issue with those who, like Andr\u00e9 Green, question the linguistic aspect of the unconscious, emphasizing Lacan's distinction between das Ding and die Sache in Freud's account of thing-presentation\". Green's criticism of Lacan also included accusations of intellectual dishonesty, he said, \"[He] cheated everybody... the return to Freud was an excuse, it just meant going to Lacan.\"", "Lacan often used an algebraic symbology  for his concepts: the big other (l'Autre) is designated A, and the little other (l'autre) is designated a.Lacan, J., The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954\u20131955 (W. W. Norton & Company, 1991),  He asserts that an awareness of this distinction is fundamental to analytic practice: \"the analyst must be imbued with the difference between A and a, so he can situate himself in the place of Other, and not the other\". Dylan Evans explains that:", "* The big other designates radical alterity, an other-ness which transcends the illusory otherness of the imaginary because it cannot be assimilated through identification. Lacan equates this radical alterity with language and the law, and hence the big other is inscribed in the order of the symbolic. Indeed, the big other is the symbolic insofar as it is particularized for each subject. The other is thus both another subject, in its radical alterity and unassimilable uniqueness, and also the symbolic order which mediates the relationship with that other subject.\"Dylan Evans, An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis (London: Routledge, 1996), p. 133;  translation modified.", "\"It is the mother who first occupies the position of the big Other for the child\", Dylan Evans explains, \"it is she who receives the child's primitive cries and retroactively sanctions them as a particular message\". The castration complex is formed when the child discovers that this other is not complete because there is a \"lack (manque)\" in the other. This means that there is always a signifier missing from the trove of signifiers constituted by the other. Lacan illustrates this incomplete other graphically by striking a bar through the symbol A; hence another name for the castrated, incomplete other is the \"barred other\".Lacan, J., \"The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious\" in \u00c9crits and Seminar V: Les formations de l'inconscient", "Other critics have dismissed Lacan's work wholesale.  called it an \"incoherent system of pseudo-scientific gibberish\", and quoted linguist Noam Chomsky's opinion that Lacan was an \"amusing and perfectly self-conscious charlatan\".Roustang, Fran\u00e7ois, Lacanian Delusion The former Lacanian analyst Dylan Evans (who published a dictionary of Lacanian terms in 1996) eventually dismissed Lacanianism as lacking a sound scientific basis and as harming rather than helping patients, and has criticized Lacan's followers for treating his writings as \"holy writ\". Richard Webster has decried what he sees as Lacan's obscurity, arrogance, and the resultant \"Cult of Lacan\". Others have been more forceful still, describing him as \"The Shrink from Hell\" and listing the many associates\u2014from lovers and family to colleagues, patients, and editors\u2014left damaged in his wake. Roger Scruton included Lacan in his book Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left, and named him as the only 'fool' included in the book\u2014his other targets merely being misguided or frauds."]}, {"page": "Keanu Reeves", "response": ["In 1999, Reeves starred in the critically acclaimed science fiction film The Matrix, the first installment in what would become The Matrix franchise. Reeves portrays computer programmer Thomas Anderson, a hacker using the alias \"Neo\", who discovers humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. Written and directed by the Wachowskis, Reeves had to prepare by reading Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology. The principal cast underwent months of intense training with martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping to prepare for the fight scenes. The Matrix proved to be a box office success; several critics considered it to be one of the best science fiction films of all time. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt it was a \"wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination\", despite perceiving weaknesses in the film's dialogue. Janet Maslin of The New York Times credited Reeves for being a \"strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero\", and thought the martial arts stunts were the film's strongest feature. The Matrix received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound."]}, {"page": "The Matrix", "response": ["The cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew. In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves read Simulacra and Simulation, Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script, and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.", "In The Matrix, a copy of Jean Baudrillard's philosophical work Simulacra and Simulation, which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as \"the book used to conceal disks\", and Morpheus quotes the phrase \"desert of the real\" from it. The term \"desert of the real\" first originated from Jorge Luis Borges' short story \"On Exactitude in Science\" (1946), which Baudrillard references in his essay. \"The book was required reading\" for the actors prior to filming. However, Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work. Some interpreters of The Matrix mention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim \"that the [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries\". \"The influence of [Baudrillard] was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel\". In addition to Baudrillard, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans\u2019s ideas on evolutionary psychology. The film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series The Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as \"(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen\".
