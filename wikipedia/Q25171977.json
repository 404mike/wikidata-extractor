Ellison went on to help form Yorkshire County Cricket Club whilst Armitage and Ulyett were selected for England's first Test cricket tour of Australia in 1877. Marsden was for many years the best single wicket cricketer in the north of England and was said to have put up a \u00a350 reward for anyone to beat him. The great southern cricketer of the time, Fuller Pilch, did just that in 1833, beating Marsden in Norwich. When a rematch was organised, over 20,000 crammed into the Old Darnall ground hoping to see Marsden defeated once more. Marsden also scored 227 in a game for Sheffield & Leicester versus Nottingham, at that time only the third double century seen in England. In 1841, Marsden he finally lost his northern single wicket crown to Henry Sampson, another Wednesday player, who later that year scored 162 against Sheffield."]}, {"page": "Henry Sampson", "response": ["Henry Sampson may refer to:", "* Henry Sampson (English cricketer) (1813\u20131885), English cricketer", "* Henry Sampson (newspaper proprietor) (1841\u20131891), English newspaper proprietor", "* Henry Sampson (New Zealand cricketer) (1947\u20131999), New Zealand cricketer", "* Henry Sampson (physician) (1629\u20131700), English nonconformist minister and physician", "* Henry Sampson (provost), Provost of Oriel College, Oxford, 1449\u20131476", "* Henry Sampson Woodfall (1739\u20131805), British printer and journalist"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Henry Sampson"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Henry Sampson"]}, {"page": "John Adamthwaite", "response": ["Adamthwaite made a single first-class appearance for Manchester against Yorkshire in 1845 at Moss Lane, Manchester.
