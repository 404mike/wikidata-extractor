Hatton used to perform a comic song \"The little fat man\" which was supposed to be a skit on himself.Simpson, A Century of Ballads, p. 127. When, for instance, he sang it before the Leeds Rational Recreation Society in April 1853, he also performed 'La ci darem la mano' with Mme D'Anteny, gave his own song 'Day and Night', and finished off with Handel's 'O ruddier than the cherry' (from Acis and Galatea). Then the Leeds Madrigal and Motet Society performed his work \"Sailors Beware!\"D. Russell, Popular Music in England 1840\u20131914: A Social History (Manchester University Press 1997), p. 33. Hatton was always very diverse. In 1856 his secular cantata of Robin Hood, to a text by George Linley, was given at the Bradford Festival.J. L. Hatton and G. Linley, Robin Hood, A Cantata (Metzler & Co., London 1879). Read here in IMSLP Despite Hatton's later collaboration with John Oxenford on the ballad operas, this is not to be confused with the opera of Robin Hood by George Alexander Macfarren to Oxenford's libretto, produced during the 1860s.", "Hatton became a foremost exponent of the writing of glees and part songs, both through his love of English madrigals, and through the influences he derived from German music. His connection with Oliphant had given him an immediate path of information and study. A visit to England of the Cologne Choir is thought to have given new impetus to the glee movement in England, and Hatton was in the vanguard. Their harmonised melodies, German part-songs by Mendelssohn and others, were called glees in imitation of the English glees, and attracted a great deal of interest. Among all English composers, Hatton with his new understanding of the German music and his sure foundation in the English melodious idiom, responded by producing a series of part-songs of which it has been said 'they were imitated by many but surpassed by none.' On his return from America Hatton became conductor of the Glee and Madrigal Union, and it was during the 1850s, while working with Charles Kean, that he published the first of his several collections of part songs, including \"Absence\", \"When evening's twilight\", \"The happiest land\", etc. They were performed by the 'Orpheus Vocal Union', a group of professional singers led by William Fielding. Hatton thus set the example for others like Henry Smart, George Alexander Macfarren and Walter Macfarren and very many more who followed where he led.William Alexander Barrett, English Glees and Part Songs: An Inquiry into their Development (Longmans, Green & Co., London 1886), pp. 330\u201333. Read here.", "Hatton was responsible for re-editing the first two volumes of Songs of England, an influential published collection which helped to establish a canon of English song with accompaniments, and cumulatively ran to three volumes under the later editorship of Eaton Faning.J.L. Hatton and Faning, E. (Ed.), Songs of England, A Collection of 274 English Melodies. 3 vols (Boosey & Co., London, 1873\u20131892). Hatton remarked, 'I have culled the choicest of the old ditties... The names of Purcell, Arne, Shield, Dibdin, Horn and Bishop are household words, and no English collection would be complete which did not contain the best songs of these composers... New symphonies and accompaniments have been written to more than fifty of the old songs.'J.L. Hatton, The Songs of England : a Collection of English Melodies, including the most popular traditional ditties and the principal songs and ballads of the last three centuries. Edited with new symphonies and accompaniments by John Liptrot Hatton (Boosey & Co., London, ?1873), 'Preface' p. iii. The collection rose to 200 songs in two volumes, and the third brought the total to 272 by 1892. His selection also drew substantially on Chappell's Popular Music of Olden Time,W. Chappell, Popular Music of the Olden Time, 2 vols (Cramer, Beale and Chappell, London), c. 1859. in which many of the accompaniments were rewritten by George Alexander Macfarren, and contrasted with Hullah's Song Book of 1866, in which only the unaccompanied melodies were given.John Hullah, The Song Book, Words and Tunes from the Best Poets and Musicians (Macmillan and Co., London 1866).Songs of England is set in the context of late Victorian song collecting by E.

He also wrote many operatic libretti, including eight for George Alexander Macfarren, including Robin Hood (1860) and Helvellyn (1864).
