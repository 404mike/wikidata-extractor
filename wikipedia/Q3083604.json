He played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Surrey and captained England in Test cricket. His school nickname \"Shrimp\" remained with him through his life, but few cricket sources refer to him by anything other than his initials. He was a selector for the England cricket team, and a cricketing knight.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Hobbs", "response": ["Hobbs began the 1909 season with a succession of large scores, including a double century in one match and two separate centuries in another.McKinstry, pp. 88\u201389. Such form placed him in contention for a place in the England team to play Australia that year, despite the English batting strength. But the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was unconvinced that Hobbs possessed the required quality. The Surrey captain and England selector H. D. G. Leveson Gower persuaded the committee to include Hobbs in the squad, then convinced a reluctant MacLaren to play him in the team.McKinstry, pp. 89\u201391. In the first Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed from the first ball he received. The match was a low-scoring one, and Australia set England 105 runs to win. Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out and England passed the target without losing a wicket.McKinstry, pp. 91\u201393. England lost the next two matches, and Hobbs was unsuccessful, with a top-score of 30 in four innings.McKinstry, pp. 94\u201396. A badly injured finger meant that he missed the remainder of the Test series;McKinstry, p. 96. in three games, he scored 132 runs at an average of 26.40. England lost the series when the remaining two matches were drawn. Hobbs struggled to regain his form when he recovered; he averaged 40.65 for the season, but of the 2,114 first-class runs he scored, nearly half came in the first month of the season.", "Category:H.
