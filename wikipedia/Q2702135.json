Johnston didn\u2019t *just* contribute vocals on the band\u2019s most acclaimed albums, but he also provided instrumental work and as early as Wild Honey appeared on the band\u2019s album covers (which he was previously unable to due to contractual reasons. Johnston appeared on the back cover of Wild Honey before making his front cover debut on Friends). He was contributing compositions from \u2018\u201920/20\u2019\u2019 onwards. Of the run of critically acclaimed Beach Boys albums where the band\u2019s artistic legacy today rests on - from Today! to Holland (not counting critically derided outliers such as Party!), Johnston contributed as an official member on every album except Today!, most of Carl And The Passions (he contributed to \u201cMarcella\u201d before leaving the band), and Holland. In what universe does this make Johnston unworthy of top line status? Furthermore, since when has the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame had any credibility when it comes to their choices in which band members are inducted? They failed to induct Bob Welch with Fleetwood Mac; they failed to induct Eric Carr with Kiss; they failed to induct Mark Evans with AC/DC; they failed to induct John Dalton with The Kinks; they failed to induct literally any of the important post-1967 members of The Byrds such as Gram Parsons and Clarence White; they failed to induct Dave Rowberry with The Animals; they failed to induct Doug Yule with The Velvet Underground; among many other examples. Using the RRHOF as a talking point because they failed to induct Johnston (and David Marks) is not one that has any basis in credibility.
