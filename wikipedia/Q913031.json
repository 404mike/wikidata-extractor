He worked in the BBC's record library from 1945 to 1960, and supervised broadcasting selections. He wrote for The Gramophone from 1948 to 1970, and wrote freelance from 1960, including liner notes for record releases. He hosted the Mardi Gras radio program on Capital Radio from 1973 to 1984.

Byng. By 1920 he is said to have achieved total record sales of five million discs. After the First World War, audio technology was improving, and he recut many of his more popular titles during the early 1920s. With the introduction of electrical microphone recording in 1925, the core body of his work was committed once again to disc, including new Gilbert and Sullivan versions under Sir Malcolm Sargent. Dawson's electrical recordings from the late 1920s and early 1930s had the longest shelf-life, and most households owned at least one (according to author Brian Rust, writing in 1979).

This indicates that the numbers were probably assigned at the time the songs were recorded. If there is a significant gap between the two numbers, the songs were probably not recorded at the same session.  If the numbers appear to be from completely different sequences, or have a different format or number of digits, this can indicate that the numbers were assigned by the recording studio, and the two sides were recorded at different studios. When record historian Brian Rust researched his discography books on early recordings, he was able to determine the studio and approximate recording date of certain songs from matrix numbers by comparing them to other numbers in the sequence."]}, {"page": "Sam Costa", "response": ["*British Dance Bands On Record 2nd Ed.
