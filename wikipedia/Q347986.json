Following the split of the Sex Pistols, he formed the Professionals with former bandmate Paul Cook. He has also released two solo albums, and worked with the likes of Johnny Thunders, Iggy Pop, Bob Dylan and Thin Lizzy.  In 1995, he formed the short-lived supergroup Neurotic Outsiders with members of Guns N' Roses and Duran Duran.

Among those who frequented the shop were members of a band called the Strand, which McLaren had also been managing. In August, the group was seeking a new lead singer. Another Sex habitu\u00e9, Johnny Rotten, auditioned for and won the job. Adopting a new name, the group played its first gig as the Sex Pistols on 6 November 1975, at Saint Martin's School of Art, and soon attracted a small but dedicated following.Gimarc (2005), p. 22; Robb (2006), p. 114; Savage (1992), p. 129. In February 1976, the band received its first significant press coverage; guitarist Steve Jones declared that the Sex Pistols were not so much into music as they were \"chaos\".Savage (1992), pp. 151\u2013152. The quote has been incorrectly ascribed to McLaren (e.g., Laing [1985], pp. 97, 127) and Rotten (e.g., \"Punk Music in Britain\" , BBC, October 7, 2002), but Savage directly cites the New Musical Express issue in which the quote originally appeared. Robb (2006), p. 148, also describes the NME article in some detail and ascribes the quote to Jones. The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, \"Bet you don't hate us as much as we hate you!\"Quoted in Friedlander and Miller (2006), p. 252. McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, \"hard and tough\".Quoted in Savage (1992), p. 163. As described by critic Jon Savage, the band members \"embodied an attitude into which McLaren fed a new set of references: late-sixties radical politics, sexual fetish material, pop history, ... youth sociology\".Savage (1992), p. 163.", "In October 1976, the Damned released the first UK punk rock band single, \"New Rose\".Griffin, Jeff, \"The Damned \", BBC.co.uk.

Jamie Reid's \"anarchy flag\" poster and his other design work for the Sex Pistols helped establish a distinctive punk visual aesthetic.Pardo (2004), p. 245. On 1 December 1976, an incident took place that sealed punk rock's notorious reputation, when the Sex Pistols and several members of the Bromley Contingent, including Siouxsie Sioux and Steve Severin, filled a vacancy for Queen on the  early evening Thames Television London television show Today to be interviewed by host Bill Grundy. When Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones was goaded by Grundy to \"say something outrageous\", Jones proceeded to call Grundy a \"dirty bastard\", a \"dirty fucker\" and a \"fucking rotter\" on live television, triggering a media controversy.Lydon (1995), p. 127; Savage (1992), pp. 257\u2013260; Barkham, Patrick, \"Ex-Sex Pistol Wants No Future for Swearing\", The Guardian (UK), March 1, 2005.

Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", the latter of which attacked Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they popularised punk rock in the UK. \"God Save the Queen\" was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the \"most heavily censored record in British history\".", "The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen. Early line-ups of The Strand\u2014sometimes known as The Swankers\u2014also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass.Savage, Jon. England's Dreaming, pp. 77\u201379; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 84.

McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the '50s rocker look associated with Marlon Brando. As John Lydon later observed, \"Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto.\"Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 83. The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni, Gene October, and Mark Stewart, among many others.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 83\u201384, 86\u201387, 89, 102, 105. Jordan, the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with \"pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look\".Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 84.", "The first Sex Pistols gig to attract broader attention was as a supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods, a leading pub rock group, at the Marquee on 12 February 1976. Rotten \"was now really pushing the barriers of performance, walking off stage, sitting with the audience, throwing Jordan across the dance floor and chucking chairs around, before smashing some of Eddie and the Hot Rods' gear.\"Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 147\u2013148. The band's first review appeared in the NME, accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, \"Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos.\"Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 148. Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London in search of the Sex Pistols. After chatting with McLaren at SEX, they saw the band at a couple of late February gigs.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 163\u2013166. The two friends immediately began organising their own Pistols-style group, Buzzcocks. As Devoto later put it, \"My life changed the moment that I saw the Sex Pistols.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 174.", "On 8 October 1976, major record label EMI signed the Sex Pistols to a two-year contract.Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 241. In short order, the band was in the studio recording a full-dress session with Dave Goodman. As later described by Matlock, \"The idea was to get the spirit of the live performance. We were pressurized to make it faster and faster.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 245. The results were rejected by the band. Chris Thomas, who had produced Roxy Music and mixed Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, was brought in to produce.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 144\u2013148. The band's first single, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", was released on 26 November 1976. John Robb\u2014soon to be a cofounder of The Membranes and later a music journalist\u2014described the record's impact: \"From Steve Jones' opening salvo of descending chords, to Johnny Rotten's fantastic sneering vocals, this song is the perfect statement...a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics...a lifestyle choice, a manifesto that heralds a new era\".Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 257\u2013258. Colin Newman, who had just cofounded the band Wire, heard it as \"the clarion call of a generation.\"Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 258.", "thumbnail|left|The Sex Pistols (Sid Vicious left, Steve Jones centre, and Johnny Rotten right) performing in Trondheim, Norway, July 1977", "In February 1977, word leaked out that Matlock was leaving the Sex Pistols. On 28 February, McLaren sent a telegram to the NME confirming the split. He claimed that Matlock had been \"thrown out...because he went on too long about Paul McCartney....The Beatles was too much.\"Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 56. In an interview a few months afterwards, Steve Jones echoed the charge that Matlock had been sacked because he \"liked The Beatles\". Years later, Jones expanded on the matter of the band's issues with Matlock: \"He was a good writer but he didn't look like a Sex Pistol and he was always washing his feet. His mum didn't like the songs.\" See also later Lydon quote: Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 307\u2013308. Matlock told the NME that he had voluntarily left the band by \"mutual agreement\". Later, in his autobiography, he described the primary impetus as his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten, exacerbated\u2014in Matlock's account\u2014by the rampant inflation of Rotten's ego \"once he'd had his name in the papers\".Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 113\u2013119, 162, 167\u2013171. Quote: p. 115. Lydon later claimed that \"God Save the Queen\", the belligerently sardonic song planned as the band's second single, had been the final straw: \"[Matlock] couldn't handle those kinds of lyrics. He said it declared us fascists.\" Though the singer could hardly see how anti-royalism equated with fascism, he claimed, \"Just to get rid of him, I didn't deny it.\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 3. See also pp. 82, 103. Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out in an effort to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 308. Matlock almost immediately formed his own band, Rich Kids, with Midge Ure, Steve New, and Rusty Egan.", "The album title led to a legal case that attracted considerable attention: a Virgin Records store in Nottingham that put the album in its window was threatened with prosecution for displaying \"indecent printed matter\". The case was thrown out when defending QC John Mortimer produced an expert witness who established that bollocks was an Old English term for a small ball, that it appeared in place names without causing local communities erotic disturbance, and that in the nineteenth century it had been used as a nickname for clergymen: \"Clergymen are known to talk a good deal of rubbish and so the word later developed the meaning of nonsense.\"Vermorel, Fred, and Judy Vermorel, Sex Pistols, p. 113. In the context of the Pistols' album title, the term does in fact primarily signify \"nonsense\". Steve Jones off-handedly came up with the title as the band debated what to call the album. An exasperated Jones said, \"Oh, fuck it, never mind the bollocks of it all.\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 202.", "On 30 October 2018, former Sex Pistols members Steve Jones and Paul Cook joined up with Billy Idol and Tony James, both formerly of another first wave English punk rock band Generation X, to perform a free entry gig at The Roxy in Hollywood, Los Angeles under the name Generation Sex, playing a combined set of the two former bands' material.", "Music historian Simon Reynolds argues that McLaren came into his own as an auteur only after the group's break-up, with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and the recruitment of Ronnie Biggs as a vocalist. Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren's onscreen proclamations in the film, whether lending them credence or not. As music journalist Dave Thompson noted in 2000, \"[T]oday, Swindle is viewed by many as the truth\"Thompson, Dave, Alternative Rock, p. 135. (despite the fact that the movie purveys, among other things, a completely illiterate Steve Jones, a talking dog, and Sid Vicious shooting audience members, including his mother, at the conclusion of \"My Way\"). Temple points out that McLaren's characterization was intended as \"a big fucking joke\u2014that he was the puppetmeister who created these pieces of clay from plasticine boxes that he modeled away and made Johnny Rotten, made Sid Vicious. It was a joke that they were completely manufactured.\"Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:24\u20131:40.

Ever since Elvis Presley joined the army!\" [1956 and 1958, respectively].)Temple, Julien, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, 1:12:54\u20131:13:02. Temple acknowledges that McLaren ultimately \"perhaps took this too much to heart.\"Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:20\u20131:23.", "According to Pistols tour manager Noel Monk and journalist Jimmy Guterman, Lydon was much more than \"the band's mouthpiece. He's its raging brain. McLaren or his friend Jamie Reid might drop a word like 'anarchy' or 'vacant' that Rotten seizes upon and turns into a manifesto, but McLaren is not the Svengali to Rotten he'd like to be perceived as. McLaren thought he was working with a tabula rasa, but he soon found out that Rotten has ideas of his own\".Monk, Noel, and Jimmy Guterman, 12 Days on the Road, pp. 76\u201377. On the other hand, there is little disagreement about McLaren's marketing talent and his crucial role in making the band a subcultural phenomenon soon after its debut.Monk, Noel, and Jimmy Guterman, 12 Days on the Road, p. 77.

He is credited as co-writer on 10 of the 12 songs appearing on the album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. However, his overall contribution to these songs has been disputed: Jones said in a 2011 interview he was \"tired of Matlock's claims that he had co-written some of the punk icon's biggest tunes\", stating that he himself had written as many songs as Matlock, whilst Matlock himself notes in his autobiography, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, that the band only wrote two songs after his departure. According to a 2014 interview, he played a big role in writing the songs that appeared on the album and Cook has stated that Matlock wrote most of the songs appearing on the album. Additionally, whilst Jones has insisted that Matlock disliked many of Johnny Rotten's controversial lyrics, Matlock has said that he had no issue with them.", "Matlock left the band in late February 1977, with contemporary reports (given to news outlets by manager Malcolm McLaren) stating that he was 'thrown out' because he \"liked the Beatles\".

Another claim, made at the time by Jones, that he thought it bizarre that Matlock was \"always washing his feet\", has also been misquoted and misinterpreted as the cause of Matlock's firing from the group.

Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs the band wrote after he joined.  While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead.  Drummer Paul Cook and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track.

Matlock agreed on the condition that he was paid beforehand. When payment was not received, he declined to attend.

He has also commented on James Williamson's guitar playing on the album: \"I'm his biggest fan. He has the technical ability of Jimmy Page without being as studious, and the swagger of Keith Richards without being sloppy.

Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth said that it was one of the albums that shaped his life and music: \"that record sliced my head off.
