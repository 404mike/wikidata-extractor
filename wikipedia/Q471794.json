Bhaskara II is generally credited with developing the chakravala method, building on the work of Jayadeva and Brahmagupta.  Solutions to specific examples of Pell's equation, such as the Pell numbers arising from the equation with n = 2, had been known for much longer, since the time of Pythagoras in Greece and a similar date in India.  William Brouncker was the first European to solve Pell's equation. The name of Pell's equation arose from Leonhard Euler mistakenly attributing Brouncker's solution of the equation to John Pell.As early as 1732\u20131733 Euler believed that John Pell had developed a method to solve Pell's equation, even though Euler knew that Wallis had developed a method to solve it (although William Brouncker had actually done most of the work):", "Wallis' letters showing a solution to the Pell's equation also appear in volume 2 of Wallis' Opera mathematica (1693), which includes articles by John Pell:", ":*  De Algebra D.

Meli called \"the golden age of the mud-slinging priority disputes\" \u2013 is associated with the name Leibniz. The first of them occurred at the beginning of 1673, during his first visit to London, when in the presence of the famous mathematician John Pell he presented his method of approximating series by differences. To Pell\u2019s remark that this discovery had already been made by Fran\u00e7ois Regnaud and published in 1670 in Lyon by Gabriel Mouton, Leibniz answered the next day.http://www.math.rutgers.edu/courses/436/Honors02/leibniz.htmlNicholas Jolley, Leibniz (2005), p. 17. In a letter to Oldenburg, he wrote that, having looked at Mouton's book, he admits Pell was right, but in his defense, he can provide his draft notes, which contain nuances not found by Renault and Mouton. Thus, the integrity of Leibniz was proved, but in this case, he was recalled later.Oldenburg's report on this incident is contained in Newton's papers, but it is not known that he attached importance to it. On the same visit to London, Leibniz was in the opposite position. February 1, 1673, at a meeting of the Royal Society of London, he demonstrated his mechanical calculator. The curator of the experiments of the Society, Robert Hooke, carefully examined the device and even removed the back cover for this. A few days later, in the absence of Leibniz, Hooke criticized the German scientist's machine, saying that he could make a simpler model. Leibniz, who learned about this, returned to Paris and categorically rejected Hooke\u2019s claim in a letter to Oldenburg and formulated principles of correct scientific behavior: \"We know that respectable and modest people prefer it when they think of something that is consistent with what someone's done other discoveries, ascribe their own improvements and additions to the discoverer, so as not to arouse suspicions of intellectual dishonesty, and the desire for true generosity should pursue them, instead of the lying thirst for dishonest profit.\" To illustrate the proper behavior, Leibniz gives an example of Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc and Pierre Gassendi, who performed astronomical observations similar to those made earlier by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Hevelius, respectively. Learning that they did not make their discoveries first, French scientists passed on their data to the discoverers."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge", "response": ["* John Pell (1610\u20131685), mathematician"]}, {"page": "John pell", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Pell "]}, {"page": "Steyning Grammar School", "response": ["*John Pell, 1611\u201385, originator of Pell's equation"]}, {"page": "James Dodson (mathematician)", "response": ["In 1742 Dodson published The Anti-Logarithmic Canon.
