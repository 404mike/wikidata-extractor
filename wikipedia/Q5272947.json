Graham (6 May 1922 \u2013 7 March 2013) was an English footballer and football manager who played and coached in the Football League. He played as a goalkeeper for Crystal Palace, making over 150 league appearances.\nHe went on to manage his former club, Crystal Palace, between 1963 and 1966. He would go on to manage Leyton Orient and Walsall. His greatest success came with Colchester United, most notably by defeating Don Revie's Leeds United 3\u20132 in an FA Cup fifth-round tie in February 1971, which was one of the biggest FA Cup shocks in the history of the competition. He also won the Watney Cup with Colchester, before resigning in 1972. He later managed Wimbledon between 1973 and 1974.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crystal Palace F.C.", "response": ["The club remained in Division Three South up until the end of the 1957\u201358 season, after which the league was restructured with clubs in the bottom half of Division Three South merging with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new Fourth Division. Palace had finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and therefore found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman Arthur Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager Arthur Rowe in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The 1960\u201361 season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great Real Madrid team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play Benfica in the European Cup final. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. Dick Graham and then Bert Head guided Palace to successive promotions in 1963\u201364 and 1968\u201369, taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the First Division.King, pp.\u00a032\u20137", "|align=left|Dick Graham"]}, {"page": "Colchester United F.C.", "response": ["During this time, the club embarked on one of the most notable runs in FA Cup history, as manager Dick Graham took his ageing side to the 1970\u201371 quarter-finals, dispatching non-league Ringmer, Cambridge United, Barnet and Rochdale following a replay. With the draw having been made prior to the replay against Rochdale, the U's knew they would face a home tie with First Division Leeds United, and duly trounced Dale 5\u20130. In the match with Leeds, the U's raced to an unprecedented 3\u20130 lead in front of a 16,000 Layer Road crowd, with two goals from Ray Crawford and one from Dave Simmons. Leeds did grab two goals back but Colchester held on for a famous 3\u20132 victory.

Fans chose two inaugural players; Peter Wright and record appearance holder Micky Cook. Wright had previously been named as Colchester United's \"Player of the Century\" by Colchester's Gazette newspaper in 2000. A committee decided on a further three players to join the Hall of Fame in the same season, with Brian Hall, Mark Kinsella and Tony English chosen. New inductees have been announced most seasons since 2007, with the entire team that famously defeated Leeds United in the FA Cup in 1971 entered into the Hall of Fame. The manager of that team, Dick Graham was inducted as the first manager to the Hall of Fame in November 2007.

Under Arthur Rowe's stewardship, the \"Glaziers\" finished 1961\u201362 fifteenth in the Third Division. Dick Graham then took the reins for the rest of Allen's time at Selhurst Park, as the club struggled in mid-table in 1962\u201363, only to win promotion as runners-up in 1963\u201364. Although his appearances in 1963\u201364 were restricted by injury (to 27) he was officially captain of the side that season. After scoring a Second Division goal in 1964\u201365, he became the only player to score a Football League goal in the first twenty consecutive seasons of post-war football. He left Crystal Palace in March 1965 at the age of 36, having scored 34 goals in 100 league games for the club."]}, {"page": "Wimbledon F.C.", "response": ["Prior to the appointment of H. R. Watts as first team manager in 1930, a committee would deal with first team affairs, such as choosing the team on a matchday. Doc Dowden was appointed manager in 1946, and stayed in the position until leaving at the end of the 1954\u201355 season. Les Henley arrived in his place as first team coach, and stayed at the club for sixteen years in which the club progressed immensely, winning the FA Amateur Cup as well as three Isthmian League championships before turning professional and moving to the Southern League. However, in 1971 Henley was replaced by Mike Everitt, who arrived as player-manager. After two seasons, Everitt left to manage Brentford and Dick Graham arrived as a replacement. Graham remained until March 1974, and a replacement was not appointed until July of that year, when Allen Batsford was made manager. Batsford led Wimbledon to The Football League, but resigned only halfway through the first League season. Dario Gradi was made manager three days later, but after three seasons he too resigned. His replacement was Dave Bassett, who took Wimbledon to sixth in the First Division before moving to Watford. Bobby Gould spent three years as manager before being replaced by Ray Harford, who spent just over a season with Wimbledon. After Harford, Peter Withe had a spell as manager lasting only three months. Joe Kinnear was brought in during January 1992, and managed the club until leaving in 1999 due to ill health. A season was spent under Egil Olsen in which the team was relegated from the FA Premier League before Terry Burton was made manager. Burton's Wimbledon narrowly missed the play-offs twice in a row before he was sacked. Stuart Murdoch managed Wimbledon for the club's final two seasons."]}]}}
