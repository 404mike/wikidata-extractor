Doyle's team was family-owned, and part of a garage services business which he worked for during the week. He was not among the front-runners in his aged Honda Civic, and was not among the top 10 non-works drivers to finish until race 7 at Donington Park. He ran 10th for part of race 6 at Rockingham, before spinning out. His first points came in race 13 at Croft, which was stopped early due to rain.\nHis best result came at Silverstone during a wet race 3, in conditions that he thrives in. He finished 8th overall, passing among others both Tom Chilton and Gordon Shedden in the new style Honda Civic run by Team Dynamics. Doyle's season was constantly hampered with gearbox problems causing various race retirements when top 10 results were looking certain.\nSince his season in the BTCC in 2008 Doyle has been hard at work at college obtaining diplomas in both sports remedial massage and personal training as well as a brief stint in the Ginetta GT supercup in 2011 with Beacon racing competing a 3 rounds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2008 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["The only all-new entry to the championship came in the shape of young Scotsman Michael Doyle, who had been a race winner in the Clio Cup the previous year.
