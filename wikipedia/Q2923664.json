While William Booth had once said to his children that \"The Salvation Army does not belong to you, or to me, it belongs to the world\" and was very wary of the leadership of the army becoming a dynasty, others believed that Booth was creating a dynasty, as was suggested by the fact that he insisted that his sons-in-law added 'Booth' to their own names (see Frederick Booth-Tucker and Arthur Booth-Clibborn).Hodges, Samuel Horatio General Booth: \"the Family\", and the Salvation Army: Showing its Rise, Progress, and ...
