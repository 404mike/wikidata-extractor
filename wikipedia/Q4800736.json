He was replaced in the side by Henry Johnson, who had joined from Darlaston just before the end of the last season, and new addition Len Andrews, who was signed from Reading in August (he had previously played over 100 games for the Saints before World War I). Goalkeeper Arthur Wood, who had lost his place the previous year to new signing Tommy Allen, also left the club in May 1921 to join Second Division side Clapton Orient, where he remained for the rest of his career. Three more players left in the summer, all of whom had spent only one season at the club \u2013 centre-forward George Reader retired from the professional game and joined Harland and Wolff on a part-time basis, outside-right Frank Wright returned to his previous position at Hamstead Colliery, and inside-right George Williams joined fellow Third Division South side Exeter City, where he played for a season before being forced to part-retire due to a leg injury.", "!scope=\"row\"|Arthur Wood"]}]}}
