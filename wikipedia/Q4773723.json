He went on to make a total of 147 appearances in all competitions between joining in 1999 and his departure in the summer of 2004. During the 2003\u20132004 season, Colgan was loaned out, where he spent most of the season with Stockport County. County were under a squad re-shuffle that had seen them use Lee Jones, James Spencer, Boaz Myhill, Anthony Williams and Colgan in the net that season.

During the season Grimsby and Mildenhall notched up a mini run in the League Cup by defeating Derby County and Tottenham Hotspur. Grimsby had remained in the automatic promotion places in League Two for the majority of the seasons but fell into the play-off places with two games remaining, meaning they would have to face local rivals Lincoln City in the semi final. The Mariners secured a 3-1 aggregate victory but failed to achieve promotion after being defeated in the League Two Play-Off Final at the Millennium Stadium by Cheltenham Town, a team who Grimsby had beaten twice in the league that season. This would eventually spell the end for manager Russell Slade who rejected a new contract and decided leave the club for Yeovil Town taking both Mildenhall and Jean-Paul Kalala with him."]}, {"page": "Keiren Westwood", "response": ["In the 2005\u201306 season, Glennon left Carlisle and they signed Anthony Williams as his replacement. It looked like Westwood would be the club's number two goalkeeper again, though he finally got his chance to compete for the number one shirt and he succeeded in taking his chance. He started 35 League Two games in their title season and continued to be the club's number one goalkeeper. At the end of the 2007\u201308 season in League One, Westwood was named in the PFA Team of the Year and also won all of the club's Player of the Season awards."]}, {"page": "Michael Ingham (footballer)", "response": ["Ingham agreed a move to League Two club Wrexham in May 2005 on a two-year contract, and the transfer was completed on 5 July when he signed the contract.

He suffered another injury on his return against Macclesfield Town on 24 September 2005, which on this occasion was a groin problem. Ingham returned to fitness ahead of their 4\u20132 home victory over Torquay United on 15 October 2005. He finished 2005\u201306 with 43 appearances for Wrexham. He underwent an operation on a hernia in May 2006. Ingham made his final appearance of 2006\u201307 in Wrexham's 2\u20131 away defeat to Milton Keynes Dons on 17 March 2007, in which he picked up a hamstring injury. He later suffered from a virus in April 2007.

He would provide cover for Town's new number 1 Anthony Williams as he was named as a substitute for the Town's pre-season friendlies against Gainsborough Trinity and Scarborough. Despite this he failed to make an appearance in either game and failed to earn a contract with The Mariners, with Slade mentioning that the Croudson had only been with the club for a few weeks to keep his fitness levels up. Soon followed a move to Conference National side Stevenage Borough for the 2004\u20132005 season. Steve would make two appearances for Borough, a 3\u20131 Football League Trophy defeat at the hands of Barnet and a 2\u20130 home defeat in the league against Woking.
