During this developmental stage, he was inspired by the teachings of Siegbert Tarrasch and consequently his playing style was based, for the most part, on dogmatic strategic concepts. By eighteen, he was Cheshire County Champion and a little later, moved to Lancashire, where he established a reputation as one of the leading players in the North of England. As an amateur, he had little opportunity to play in international tournaments, but he did compete at Scarborough in 1927, finishing second, tied with Frederick Yates, ahead of several recognised masters including Efim Bogoljubov, Sir George Thomas and Victor Buerger. He defeated not only the hugely experienced Bogoljubov, but also the first-prize winner, Edgard Colle. It was around this time, in his twenties, that he edited a well-respected games section in the magazine Chess Amateur."]}, {"page": "1996 in chess", "response": ["*Victor Buerger, Latvian-British player, moderately successful in tournaments of the 1920s and 30s - ?"]}, {"page": "Joseph Henry Blake (chess player)", "response": ["His best achievement was victory, ahead of G\u00e9za Mar\u00f3czy, George Alan Thomas, Frederick Yates and Boris Kosti\u0107, at Weston-super-Mare 1922.weston He shared 2nd at London 1922 (Major Open), tied for 7-8th at Hastings International Chess Congress 1922/23 (Akiba Rubinstein won), took 2nd, behind Thomas, at London 1923, took 5th at Liverpool 1923 (Jacques Mieses won),liverpool tied for 7-8th at Hastings 1923/24 (Max Euwe won), tied for 6-7th at Weston-super-Mare 1924 (Euwe won),weston took 2nd, behind R.P.
