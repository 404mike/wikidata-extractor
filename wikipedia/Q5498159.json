John Hutchinson assigned a plant collected by Battiscombe from the Aberdare Range in Nyandarua County to the genus Guizotia and called it G. reptans. Earl Edward Sherff described in 1923 a plant from the western slopes of Mount Kenya, found by Mearns, as Bidens spathulata. By 1926 he had realised it was identical to Moore's species, but as he thought it better placed in Bidens, he made the new combination B. jacksonii. Robert Elias Fries collected a slightly different specimen in 1928 that he called Guizotia reptans var. keniensis, while Sherff also had a plant he regarded as sufficiently divergent and called it Coreopsis jacksonii var. arthrochaeta in 1929. It wasn't until 1974 that J. Baag\u00f8e synonymised all of these names, and had to create the new combination Guizotia jacksonii to satisfy the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. cited on "]}]}}
