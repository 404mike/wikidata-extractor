Like two of his siblings, his surname was recorded as Hutchingham in the birth register, although the family is referred to as Etchingham in most official documents.\nIn 1901, he was living in Church Lane, Gorey, where he was employed as a horse trainer. By 1911, he was back in Courtown, where he gave his profession as journalist in the census of that year.He became a member of the Irish Volunteers, Sinn F\u00e9in, the Gaelic League and the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB).\nHe was jailed in 1916 for his part in the Enniscorthy raid to seize the railway and to prevent reinforcements reaching Dublin to put down the Easter Rising. When the Dublin rising failed, Etchingham surrendered and was arrested, but released in the amnesty of 1917.He was first elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for Wicklow East at the 1918 general election. As with the other Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, he did not take his seat in the British House of Commons, sitting instead in the revolutionary First D\u00e1il, which met in the Mansion House, Dublin in January 1919.\nHe was later appointed to the government as Secretary for Fisheries. He was returned unopposed in the 1921 general election and opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the D\u00e1il debates and again at the Volunteer Executive. He lost his D\u00e1il seat in the 1922 election. He was jailed in 1923 during the Irish Civil War and died in prison from natural causes later that year.", "link_mentions": {}}}
