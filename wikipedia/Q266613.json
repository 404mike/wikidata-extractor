He is the manager of EFL Championship club Derby County, for whom he previously served as interim player-manager. He spent much of his playing career as a forward while also being used in various midfield roles. Widely considered one of the best players of his generation, Rooney is the record goalscorer for both the England national team and Manchester United.Rooney joined the Everton youth team at the age of nine and made his professional debut for the club in 2002 at the age of 16. He spent two seasons at the Merseyside club, before moving to Manchester United for \u00a325.6 million in the 2004 summer transfer window where he won 16 trophies and became the only English player, alongside teammate Michael Carrick, to win the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, UEFA Europa League, and FIFA Club World Cup. He scored 253 goals for United in all competitions to make him their top goalscorer of all time, with 183 Premier League goals being the second most scored by a player for any single club, behind Sergio Ag\u00fcero (184 goals for Manchester City). Rooney's 208 Premier League goals make him the Premier League's second-top scorer of all time. He also has the third-highest number of assists in the Premier League, with 103.Rooney made his senior international debut for England in February 2003, aged 17, and is England's youngest ever goalscorer. He played at UEFA Euro 2004 and scored four goals, briefly becoming the youngest goalscorer in the history of the European Championship. Rooney later featured at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and was widely regarded as his country's best player. He has won the England Player of the Year award four times, in 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015.

Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.
