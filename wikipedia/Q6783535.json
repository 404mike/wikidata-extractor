Following this, and an increased investment of \u00a31\u00a0million per year from the club, a number of players broke through to the first team squad; ahead of the 2010\u201311 season, almost a third of the Derby squad were academy graduates, with Mason Bennett setting the club record for youngest first team appearance when he made his full debut with a start in a defeat at Middlesbrough on 22 October 2011 at the age of 15 years and 99 days old. This helped strengthen the academy's reputation and reinforced CEO Tom Glick's stated desire to make Moor Farm \"the academy of choice in the Midlands.\" In August 2012, Derby's academy became a tier 2 academy under the new controversial Elite Player Performance Plan. It was awarded Tier 1 status two years later in July 2014. Focus on the academy continued during the ownership of Mel Morris after his purchase of the club later that year and, at the end of the 2019-20 season Derby had given more first-team minutes to players aged under 21 than any other club in the Football League Championship, with academy graduates such as Max Bird, Louie Sibley, Jason Knight, Jayden Bogle, Morgan Whittaker and Lee Buchanan getting a total of 7,946 minutes in the league during the campaign. When discussing targets for the 2020-21 campaign, Morris stated \"We are not going to see a team of 11 players from the Academy featuring this season (2019/20) but the target for next season (is) 50% of our starting 11 should be Academy players.

However, the club were knocked out of the first round of League Cup against League Two opposition for the third season in a row against Shrewsbury Town. Derby maintained their top 2 position in September, with the main highlight being a 2\u20131 win at local rivals Nottingham Forest, despite the fact that goalkeeper Frank Fielding gave away a penalty and was sent off after 67 seconds, Jeff Hendrick's winner in the game was his first goal in senior football. October and November were disappointing with Derby picking up only 1 win and 5 points out of a possible 30 as Derby fell to 15th place in the league, with a 4\u20130 defeat at rivals Leicester City at the start of the month, starting the slump in form. In mid-October, Nigel Clough and his backroom staff signed new -year contracts. Derby picked up form in December and January, losing only twice in 9 games, picking up 17 points as Derby ended the month 12th peaking at 8th in mid-January. February was another disappointing month, where they picked up on 1 point, scoring no goals with them club suffering their 2nd 4\u20130 defeat of the season to the hands of Southampton by the end of the month, Derby were 15th in the table. From the start of April to mid march, Derby picked up 14 points out a possible 21 which lifted Derby to 11th in the table, 5 points off the play-offs with 4 games remaining, Derby manager Nigel Clough however ruled out a play-off place, wishing there was more the 4 games left as the club were showing great form. However defeats to Middlesbrough and Cardiff City in 4 days ended the Derby's play-off chances. Derby finished the season 12th in the league, 11 points off the play-off players, with Nigel Clough being satisfied with the performances of the team, stating a lack of firepower as the reason why they fell short and a target to improve in 2012\u201313. Derby ended the season with a win and a draw as they finished in 12th place on 64 points, 7 places and 15 points better off than the previous season, the club's first top half finish since promotion in 2007 and best league standing since relegation in 2008. Derby's summer signings had mixed fortunes with Craig Bryson, Jason Shackell & Frank Fielding all being in contention for the Player of the Year award. Striker Theo Robinson was joint top scorer with Steve Davies on 12 goals and Jamie Ward's form impressed enough to earn him a new contract. Tom Naylor also earned praise from Nigel Clough for his development and impressed when standing in for John Brayford at right-back. Nathan Tyson, signed from local rivals Forest however failed to score in 24 appearances, Chris Maguire struggled to break into the first team and was loaned out to Portsmouth for the final two months of the season. Chris Riggott rejoined the club on a one-year contract, but was released in December due to injuries. The club relied less on loan signings and more on the club's academy as Jeff Hendrick, Mark O'Brien, Callum Ball, Mason Bennett and Will Hughes all broke into the first team, Bennett and Hughes making their debuts with Bennett setting a club record for youngest ever team player, making his first appearance against Middlesbrough on 22 October 2011 at 15 years and 99 days old, beating Lee Holmes' record by 169 days.

Derby also reached the final of the Central League Cup final against Manchester City Elite Development squad. The club recorded an average attendance of 26,020, 3 down previous campaign but still the third highest in the Championship behind West Ham United and Southampton. This was also the 14th best average attendance in the country, higher than the average gate of eight Premier League clubs.

The plans included five cafes/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of office space. The plans were scaled down from the planned \u00a320 million pound development proposed in 2007. Derby County CEO Tom Glick, said that the plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations, due to be introduced in the Football League from 2012, as revenue from the Plaza was intended to be reinvested back into the club. The planned development also coincided with plans from the City Council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed Plaza.

Theo Robinson's 3rd-minute strike saw Derby open the scoring in an eventual 1\u20131 draw, though they owed much to an inspired performance from Frank Fielding for keeping them in the game. The draw came despite the absence of John Brayford, who missed his first match since joining Derby 15 months previously after picking up an injury in training, and top-scorer Steve Davies' early exit after picking up an eye injury. With the Brayford ruled out for six weeks and Davies for twelve, Derby cast their eye over the emergency loan market and confirmed they have enquired about Newcastle United's James Perch though Newcastle denied the request as the player was providing defensive cover. Two days after the game it was announced Nigel Clough, alongside his backroom staff, had signed new -year deals at Derby to take them through until summer 2015. The following day, Derby let the lead slip twice as they drew 2\u20132 at Reading and lost 2\u20130 at Middlesbrough the following weekend to drop to 6th in the table, their lowest position of the table, and stretch their winless streak to five games. The Middlesbrough game was notable for featuring the debut of the highly touted Mason Bennett, who set a club record for youngest ever team player, making his first appearance at 15 years and 99 days old. The final game of October saw Derby rise to fifth in the table and finally ending their winless streak by grabbing their first win in 6 with a 3\u20131 win over Portsmouth, with strikes from Craig Bryson and Jamie Ward sandwiching Chris Maguire's first league goal for the club on his first league start in an acclaimed performance. Craig Bryson's performance earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week. and Mason Bennett also made his first home appearance, coming on in the second half. The match saw injuries to Theo Robinson (hamstring), Mark O'Brien (shoulder) and Chris Maguire (broken nose) to add to eight other injured first team players (Shaun Barker, John Brayford, Steven Davies, Saul Deeney, Nathan Tyson, James Bailey, Paul Green and Chris Riggott). With eleven senior players unavailable, the club admitted it \"might\" consider entering the loan market, though Clough later stated \"We are trying to find the solutions from within the squad\", suggesting that their frequent use of the loan market in previous seasons had had a destabilizing effect on the squads of the time.", "The first match of the month saw Derby crash to a 3\u20130 defeat at home to Cardiff City, their biggest home defeat for 22 months, and drop out of the playoff for the positions for the first time in the season. Russell Anderson added to the club's injury problems by going off with a damaged hamstring. Despite Derby's numerous injury issues. Clough insisted loans weren't needed and instead loaned out midfielder Stephen Pearson to fellow Championship side Bristol City until 2 January. The last match before the November international break saw Derby race into a 2\u20130 lead away to Peterborough United, courtesy of a Theo Robinson brace, before losing 3\u20132 thanks to a stoppage time winner and slipping to a season low of 8th in the table. The winning goal was a bone of contention for Clough, whose post match criticism of referee Iain Williamson was strong enough to earn him a \u00a32,000 fine from the FA. Speaking after the defeat, Clough stated that the recent results (one win from eight) had clouded the seasons positives, such as the \"emergence of (the) youngsters\". The match saw Will Hughes make his debut as a late substitute at the age of just 16, meaning Derby finished the game with five Academy graduate players aged 19-or-under on the pitch (Jeff Hendrick, Mark O'Brien having started and Mason Bennett, Callum Ball and Hughes appearing as substitutes).", "Derby started April with a 0\u20130 draw at home to Ipswich Town, before taking on Leeds United at Elland Road two days later, Leeds were down to ten men as Michael Brown was given a straight red card in 25 minutes after a stomach-high tackle on Theo Robinson, goals from Craig Bryson after 32 minutes and Steve Davies after 66 minutes were enough to beat the Yorkshire side 2\u20130, Derby 7th consecutive win v Leeds and their 3rd consecutive league double.

A 1\u20130 defeat from a late Curtis Main winner against Middlesbrough and a 2\u20130 defeat at Cardiff City with goal from Joe Mason and a goal from defender Mark Hudson from his own half, mathematically ended Derby's play-off chances and ensured Derby will stay in the Championship for a 5th consecutive seasons as Derby dropped to 14th in the table, 8 points off the play-offs with two games to play. John Brayford made his first team return in the game, replacing the injured Tom Naylor at half time who picked up a tight hamstring, Jamie Ward was also replaced early in the second half with a dead leg.
