Sometimes credited as R. D. Cook, Cook was born in Kew, Surrey, and lived in west London as an adult. A writer on music from the late 1970s until he died, Cook was co-author, with Brian Morton, of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings, which lasted for ten editions until 2010. Richard Cook's Jazz Companion and It's About That Time: Miles Davis On and Off the Record were published in 2005.\nCook began as a staff writer for NME in the early 1980s. The editor at the time, Neil Spencer, commented that he \"would take on the pieces that the fashion-oriented shunned - a Roxy Music review, an audience with a fading star, a piece on the emergent sounds of Africa\". He was later the jazz critic for The Sunday Times, a music writer for the New Statesman. Cook was formerly editor of The Wire, when it was a jazz-centred periodical (it broadened its coverage towards the end of his editorship), and edited Jazz Review magazine from its foundation in 1998. Jazz Review continued for a time after his death, using Cook's approach to the music as continuing inspiration; it did not name a specific successor (Morton) for six months. Cook also presented a programme on jazz for BBC local radio GLR.\nCook was the UK jazz catalogue manager for PolyGram (1992\u201397) and also produced albums by the trumpeter Guy Barker. During his spell at PolyGram, Cook launched the short-lived 'Redial' re-issue line of classic British jazz albums. In 2002, he was responsible for issuing a 10 CD limited-edition set by the American avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor of 1990 recordings, 2 Ts for a Lovely T, on the Codanza label.\nCook died from bowel and liver cancer on 25 August 2007, aged 50, in London, a year after diagnosis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joy Division", "response": ["Producer Martin Hannett \"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\". Hannett demanded clean and clear \"sound separation\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was \"crucial\". There are \"devices of distance\" in his production and \"the sound is an illusion of physicality\"."]}, {"page": "Siouxsie and the Banshees", "response": ["The Banshees followed in 1982 with the psychedelic A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The record, featuring strings on several numbers, was an intentional contrast to their previous work, with Severin later describing it as a \"sexy album\". The British press greeted it enthusiastically. Richard Cook finished his NME review with this sentence: \"I promise...this music will take your breath away\". At that time, McGeoch was struggling with alcohol problems, and was hospitalised on his return to a promotional trip from Madrid. The band fired him shortly thereafter. Severin asked Robert Smith to take over guitarist duties again; Smith accepted and rejoined the group in November 1982."]}, {"page": "John Zorn", "response": ["Zorn performs on saxophone with Naked City, Painkiller, and Masada but more often conducts bands like Moonchild, Simulacrum and several of his Masada-related ensembles or encourages musicians toward their own interpretations of his work. He has composed concert music for classical ensembles and orchestras, and produced music for opera, sound installations, film and documentary. Tours of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have been extensive, usually at festivals with musicians and ensembles that perform his diverse repertoire.John Zorn Festival in Israel 2008 website  accessed 2 September 2008.Kelman, J.

According to Cook, \"Zorn's admirers often consider him a masterful bebop alto player, but when he does perform in something approaching that style his playing has little of the tension and none of the relaxation of the great beboppers, often sounding more strangulated than anything\"."]}, {"page": "Kew", "response": ["*Richard Cook (1957\u20132007), British jazz writer, magazine editor and former record company executive, was born in Kew."]}, {"page": "Cecil Taylor", "response": ["In 1955, Taylor moved back to New York City from Boston. He formed a quartet with soprano saxophonist, Steve Lacy, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and drummer Dennis Charles. Taylor's first recording, Jazz Advance, featured Lacy and was released in 1956. The recording is described by Richard Cook and Brian Morton in the Penguin Guide to Jazz: \"While there are still many nods to conventional post-bop form in this set, it already points to the freedoms in which the pianist would later immerse himself.\" Taylor's quartet featuring Lacy also appeared at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival, which was made into the album At Newport. Taylor collaborated with saxophonist John Coltrane in 1958 on Stereo Drive, now available as Coltrane Time."]}, {"page": "Synchronicity (The Police album)", "response": ["Professional music critics at the time of release and afterwards have been mostly positive towards the album. Richard Cook of NME called Synchronicity \"a record of real passion that is impossible to truly decipher\", and felt that \"although [the album] magnifies the difference between Sting and Summers and Copeland it also evolves the group into a unique state: a mega-band playing off glittering experimentation against the sounding board of a giant audience. It's the sound of a group coming apart and coming together, a widescreen drama with a fascination at a molecular level. Some of the music fuses intuitive pop genius with willfully dense orchestration so powerfully it stuns. It is occasionally sensational.\""]}, {"page": "Earl Hines", "response": ["Hines met Louis Armstrong in the poolroom of the Black Musicians' Union, local 208, on State and 39th in Chicago.

Melody Maker deemed it \"a milestone in the history of awfulness\", and the NMEs Richard Cook wrote: \"Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters' writing has been blown to hell\u00a0...

In 1994, Jon Savage described the music as \"a definitive Northern Gothic statement: guilt-ridden, romantic, claustrophobic\". Analysing Curtis's work, music journalist Richard Cook remarked in 1983: \"sex has disappeared from these unknown pleasures; it is an aftermath of passion where everything's (perhaps) lost\".Cook, Richard. \"Cries & Whispers (A retrospective on the vinyl pain and pleasure of Joy Division and New Order)\".

'Stairway to the Stars' is almost as fine, and the thoughtful 'The Goof and I' and 'Susie's Blues' show that Chaloff still had plenty of ideas about what could be done with a bebopper's basic materials.  This important session has retained all its power.'Richard Cook and Brian Morton, The Penguin Guide to Jazz, 1992"]}]}}
