Some wealthy Americans and Western European aristocrats, such as the renowned poet Lord Byron and later the American physician Samuel Howe, took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries.Richard, Laura E. Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe, pp. 21\u201326. Boston: Dana Estes & Company, 1909. In Britain there was strong support led by the Philosophical Radicals, the Whigs, and the Evangelicals. Many helped to finance the revolution. The London Philhellenic Committee helped insurgent Greece to float two loans in 1824 (\u00a3800,000) and 1825 (\u00a32,000,000).Robert Zegger, \"Greek Independence and the London Committee\" History Today (April 1970), Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp. 236-245 online.Wynne William H., (1951), State insolvency and foreign bondholders, New Haven, Yale University Press, vol. 2, p. 284 The Scottish philhellene Thomas Gordon took part in the revolutionary struggle and later wrote the first histories of the Greek revolution in English. ", "The losses Ibrahim Pasha had taken at Missolonghi had greatly reduced his army, and he spent the rest of 1826 chasing the Greek guerillas up and down the mountains.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pp. 306-307. In late June 1826, Reshid Pasha had arrived outside of Athens and laid siege to the city, marking the beginning of the siege of the Acropolis. By the middle of August, only the Acropolis still held out under Yannis Gouras.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 310. To break the siege, an attack was launched on Reshid Pasha on 18 August 1826 led by the guerrilla leader Georgios Karaiskakis and the French philhellene Colonel Charles Nicolas Fabvier but were driven off with the loss of some 300 dead. On 13 October 1826, Gouras was killed by an Ottoman sniper and a week later, the new commander Yannis Makriyannis was wounded three times in a single day. In December, Febvier was able to infiltrate a force of some 500 men into the Akropolis, bringing in much needed supplies of gunpowder, through he was much offended when Makriyannis had his men start firing to wake up the Turks, trapping Febvier and his men.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 311. In the summer of 1826, the Greek government gave command of its army to the British General Sir Richard Church.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 300. The British historian George Finlay wrote: \"Church was of a small, well-made, active frame, and of a healthy constitution. His manner was agreeable and easy, with the polish of a great social experience, and the goodness of his disposition was admitted by his enemies, but the strength of his mind was not the quality of which his friends boasted...Both Church and the Greeks misunderstood one another. The Greeks expected Church to prove a Wellington, with a military chest well supplied from the British treasury. Church expected the irregulars of Greece to execute his strategy like regiments of guards\". Church landed in Greece in March 1827, and was welcomed by his old friend Kolokotronis. A week later, Lord Cochrane arrived to take command of the Greek Navy and refused to leave his yacht until the Greeks agreed to form a united government. On 31 March 1827 the Trizina Assembly began its work, drafting a new constitution and offered the presidency of Greece to the former Russian foreign minister, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias. In the meantime, the siege of Athens continued. On 5 February 1827, a force of 2,300 Greeks under the command of Colonel Thomas Gordon landed at Piraeus, and laid siege to the monastery of Ayios Spiridhon, held by Turkish and Albanian troops. In April 1827, Church and Cochrane arrived at Athens and immediately clashed over strategy.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 312. When the Ottoman garrison at Aios Spiridhon surrendered, they were promised safe conduct, but as they were marching out, a shot went off and most of the Ottoman soldiers were killed. Cochrane insisted on a bold but risky plan to stage a night attack across the open plains to break the siege. An operation which launched on 5 May 1827 ended in disaster, as the Greek forces got lost and scattered as the captains quarrelled with one another. This led to a devastating Ottoman cavalry charge in the morning, with Ottomans hunting the scattered Greek forces almost at leisure.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 313. On 5 June 1827, the starving and thirsty men in the Acropolis surrendered in the last Ottoman victory of the war.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 314."]}, {"page": "Andreas Miaoulis", "response": ["He was born on the island of Hydra in a family of Euboean origin, namely from the town of Fylla.Antonios Miaoulis, Short Biography of Admiral Miaulis printed in Thomas Gordon, History of the Greek Revolution T1, Blackwood, 1832 p.372  He was known among his fellow islanders as a trader in corn who had gained wealth and made a popular use of his money.
