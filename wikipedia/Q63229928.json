At the age of twenty-four he emigrated to the United States, and became a clerk in the mercantile house of Donnelly Bros, New York. After a few years, he removed to Maysville, Kentucky, and went into business, but later on established himself in St. Louis. When the California Gold Rush began, he saw the opportunity and went to San Francisco in the latter part of 1849, opening a mercantile establishment there in partnership with Joseph A. Donohoe, Daniel T. Murphy and Adam Grant. After ten years of business, the firm dissolved, and Kelly took part in founding the Pacific Coast banking house of Donohoe, Ralston & Co., in San Francisco, and the firm of Eugene Kelly & Co., in New York. In 1894, Kelly retired and the house was dissolved. He was a factor in railroad business and banking for a third of a century. He founded the Southern Bank of the State of Georgia and contributed largely to the rebuilding of the town hall of Charleston, South Carolina, after the Civil War. He was a director in the National Park Bank, the Bank of New York, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, and the Title Guarantee and Trust Company; he was also connected with many other financial and railroad corporations.\nHe was known as a supporter of arts, charity and education: he was one of the original life members of the National Academy of Design, for thirteen years a member of the New York City Board of Education, a patron of the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a member of the New York Chamber of Commerce. In 1884, he was Elector-at-Large and chairman of the New York Electoral College. In the Roman Catholic Church, of which he was a member, he was a prominent layman, being one of the founders of the Catholic University of America, and a director until his death. He was also a trustee of Seton Hall College and a member of the committees which had oversight of the construction of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, the Washington Square Arch and the Statue of Liberty erected in New York Harbor.\nThe first wife of Eugene Kelly died in 1848.

Kelly's sons pledged additional funds for the chapel as necessary. The next year, the trustees of St. Patrick's Cathedral held an architectural design competition for the chapel, east of the cathedral's apse. The trustees received submissions from American, Canadian, French, and British architects before giving the commission to Charles T. Mathews of New York City. After traveling to Europe to study architectural influences, Mathews prepared plans for the chapel by September 1900.

The Temple Court Building and Annex were made a New York City designated landmark in 1997, and are also contributing properties to the Fulton\u2013Nassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district created in 2005.

The New York Times reported that January that Kelly had hired Silliman and Farnsworth to construct a structure on the property. The firm filed plans with the New York City Department of Buildings in April 1881 for a 10-story office structure, which would become the original building. The structure would be called the \"Kelly Building\", and would have a facade of granite, brick, and terracotta. Richard Deeves was the contractor for the structure, and work began in May 1881, with an expected completion date of May 1882. The structure was to be one of the first office buildings to be erected in Lower Manhattan after the Panic of 1873, and the Real Estate Record and Guide predicted that Kelly would earn an annual profit of 20% of the building cost."]}, {"page": "Eugene Kelly (disambiguation)", "response": ["Eugene Kelly (born 1965) is a Scottish musician.", "Eugene Kelly also refers to:", "*Eugene Kelly (banker) (1808\u20131894), Irish-American businessman and philanthropist"]}]}}
