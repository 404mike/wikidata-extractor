Making two separate expeditions in 1877 and 1878, Ross was the first white man to venture south of Old Calabar to the palm-oil town of Odobo. He discovered  the Falls of Kom\u00e8 ('D\u00fcben' falls]) on the River Meme and recorded details of the places, customs and languages of Efut. In 1881 the Mission was torn apart by a schism between Ross and Anderson that was to be a crucial link in the chain of events which led to the annexation by Britain of the territory from Calabar to the Niger.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Ross", "response": ["Alexander Ross may refer to:", "* Alexander Ross (writer) (c. 1590\u20131654), vicar; Scottish author of Medicus Medicatus", "* Alexander Ross (poet) (1699\u20131784), Scottish author of Helenore, or the Fortunate Shepherdess", "* Alexander Ross (British Army officer) (1742\u20131827), Surveyor-General of the Ordnance", "* Alexander Ross (fur trader) (1783\u20131856), Canadian fur trader", "* Alexander Ross (civil servant) (1800\u20131889), British civil servant in India", "* Alexander Ross (Canadian politician) (1829\u20131901), Canadian banker and politician", "* Alexander Ross (architect) (1834\u20131925), Scottish architect and provost of Inverness", "* Alexander Ross (Australian politician) (1843\u20131912), New South Wales politician", "* Alexander Ross (engineer) (1845\u20131923), Scottish railway engineer", "* Alex Ross (rower) (Sir Alexander Ross, 1907\u20131994), New Zealand-born banker and rower", "* Alexander Ross (cricketer) (1895\u20131972), Scottish cricketer and civil servant", "* Alexander Ross (missionary) (1838-1884)"]}]}}
