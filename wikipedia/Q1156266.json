Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell,  The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which David Harvey, Manuel Castells, Edward Soja, and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist Martina L\u00f6w.L\u00f6w, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M. Approaches deriving from the post-colonialism discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years.

According to Doreen Massey, calling a country in Africa a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the \u201cdeveloped\u201d world, a view she condemns as \"Eurocentrism.\" In this vein, Helmuth Berking criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as \u201cglobocentrism.\u201d He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning.
