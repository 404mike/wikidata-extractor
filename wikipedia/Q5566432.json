The first committee consisted of Kathleen Bell, Vera Mooney, Elsie Leonard, Elsie Ronaldson and Helen Ross. Honorary members included Mary O'Malley and Dehra Parker.

She was a founding member, with Gladys Maccabe, of the Ulster Society of Women Artists and was president of the society from 1979 to 1981.", "Upon her return from Belgium CEMA staged a solo exhibition with thirty-five of Henry's oils and watercolours at their Belfast gallery. The exhibition was arranged at short notice when another was unexpectedly cancelled. Writer Nesca Robb opened the exhibition where it is claimed a new painting technique was revealed -\"monopainting\", described as paint drawn through a gauze over glass. The exhibition included a 'Breton' series, Kerry Tangle, Ship Pattern, Barrack Shapes, Lough Shapes, and Backs. In addition she displayed In the Park, an oil previously seen at the Royal Ulster Academy in 1955 and at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in 1956, and a second oil City Lunch Hour exhibited at the Royal Ulster Academy in 1956.Stewart, 1997, p.338 One critic commented that the show was\"...one of the most vital and interesting exhibitions that CEMA has sponsored -a belated but welcome tribute to an artist, who has received all too little public recognition. Miss Henry is at once one of the most forceful and most discreet of our painters -forceful in the clarity of her design and the boldness of her colour; discreet in her detail and the elimination of non-essentials.The Ulster Society of Women Artists was founded in 1957 by Gladys Maccabe with the support of Olive Henry and a number of others at a time when no arts societies were accepting female artists into their ranks. The main objective was to ensure the development of quality art and women artists in Ulster. The organisation began with ten invited artists. Henry was to exhibit with the society throughout her life."]}, {"page": "Ren\u00e9e Bickerstaff", "response": ["Bickerstaff donated work to a charity exhibition in the Ulster Hall organised by Gladys Maccabe in aid of an ex-servicemans charity in 1951.

In 1955 whilst lamenting the inconsistent quality of the show, one critic writes,\"Renee Bickerstaff, who is of course a well-known artist, in her Old Cloisters, Oxford gives a useful object lesson in handling to her less sure fellow club members,\"Bickerstaff was appointed honorary treasurer of the Ulster Society Women Artists when they were formed by Gladys Maccabe, Deborah Brown, Alice Berger Hammerschlag and others in late 1957. She remained treasurer for twenty-one years and was to show with the Society for the rest of her life."]}]}}
