He served as lieutenant in HMS Resolute under the command of Horatio Thomas Austin on the 1850-1851 Admiralty search for Sir John Franklin's missing Northwest Passage expedition. His correspondence with Sophia Cracroft regarding the search for Franklin's lost expedition, 1857-1859 commanded by Leopold McClintock is held by the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England.In October 1850, Aldrich participated in a sledging programme to lay depots on Somerville Island, to the southwest of Cornwallis Island, in preparation for a search by sledge the following year. In the spring of the following year (starting 15 April 1851) he was away for 62 days, travelling by sledge to Bathurst Island. He went over 550 mi (890 km), at an average rate of 9+1\u20442 mi (15.3 km) a day, examining part of the island's west coast before proceeding north to explore the western coasts of the small islands as far as Cape Aldrich.Cape Aldrich on the western shore of \u00cele Vanier should be distinguished from Cape Aldrich on Ellesmere Island, both in Nunavut, Canada.\nHe retired with the rank of captain in 1860, and was reserved on half pay; he was subsequently promoted to rear admiral (31 December 1876), vice admiral (23 November 1881) and admiral (24 May 1887); he died in 1891 (2 June).\nHe was the son of Robert Aldrich and Anne Davey.
