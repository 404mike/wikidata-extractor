He served as lieutenant in HMS Resolute under the command of Horatio Thomas Austin on the 1850-1851 Admiralty search for Sir John Franklin's missing Northwest Passage expedition. His correspondence with Sophia Cracroft regarding the search for Franklin's lost expedition, 1857-1859 commanded by Leopold McClintock is held by the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England.In October 1850, Aldrich participated in a sledging programme to lay depots on Somerville Island, to the southwest of Cornwallis Island, in preparation for a search by sledge the following year. In the spring of the following year (starting 15 April 1851) he was away for 62 days, travelling by sledge to Bathurst Island. He went over 550 mi (890 km), at an average rate of 9+1\u20442 mi (15.3 km) a day, examining part of the island's west coast before proceeding north to explore the western coasts of the small islands as far as Cape Aldrich.Cape Aldrich on the western shore of \u00cele Vanier should be distinguished from Cape Aldrich on Ellesmere Island, both in Nunavut, Canada.\nHe retired with the rank of captain in 1860, and was reserved on half pay; he was subsequently promoted to rear admiral (31 December 1876), vice admiral (23 November 1881) and admiral (24 May 1887); he died in 1891 (2 June).\nHe was the son of Robert Aldrich and Anne Davey. He married Elizabeth Strutt Jeakes (daughter of William Jeakes) on 31 March 1852, and had two daughters, Alice M and Fanny K Aldrich. He was an uncle of Admiral Pelham Aldrich CVO (British Arctic Expedition 1875\u20131876) and the pioneering woman surgeon Dame Louisa Aldrich-Blake.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bathurst Island (Nunavut)", "response": ["The island was first inhabited by Independence I culture native peoples around 2000 BC. They were followed by Independence II, Pre-Dorset, and Dorset cultures. Brooman Point Village on the eastern coast of Bathurst Island was the site of Thule native tribes around AD\u00a01000, conceivably during a warmer climate episode. No modern Inuit resided there at the time of European discovery in the 1800s.  But Inuit people in the region likely knew of its abundant wildlife, and possibly travelled there on hunting trips. William Edward Parry was the first European to discover the island in 1819, charting its southern coast. It was named for Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1812-1827. Robert Dawes Aldrich charted much of its west coast in 1851, while George Henry Richards and Sherard Osborn charted its north coast in 1853."]}, {"page": "\u00cele Vanier", "response": ["The first known sighting of the island was by Robert Dawes Aldrich in 1851, but its insular nature wasn't proven until the 1950s."]}]}}
