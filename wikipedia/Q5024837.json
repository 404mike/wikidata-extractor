The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on James Coburn, evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for Major Eazy, which Ezquerra drew in Battle, as well as Cursed Earth Koburn, a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003.

He, editor Steve MacManus and artist Dave Gibbons devised Rogue Trooper, a \"Genetic Infantryman\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him.

Grant and Wagner introduced the Ventriloquist in their first Batman story and the Ratcatcher in their third. The pair also created the bleak nuclear dystopia The Last American for Epic Comics with longtime Dredd artist Mike McMahon. Arguments over the direction of that title and the ending of the Judge Dredd story \"Oz\" led to the end of their writing partnership and they split their work between them: Wagner kept \"Judge Dredd\", while Grant continued \"Strontium Dog\" and \"Anderson, Psi Division\" and became the sole writer of Detective Comics.
