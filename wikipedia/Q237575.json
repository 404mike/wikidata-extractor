Following in their line of thought, Thomas Day (1748\u20131789) wrote Sandford and Merton, elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. Maria Edgeworth (1776\u20131849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is \"The Purple Jar\".

William Cowper was born in Berkhamsted Rectory in 1731. Although he moved away when still a boy, there are frequent references to the town in his poems and letters. In the Victorian era, Cowper became a cult figure and Berkhamsted was a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. Maria Edgeworth, a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults' and children's literature who was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe, lived in Berkhamsted as a child in the 18th century. Between 1904 and 1907, the Llewelyn Davies boys were the inspiration for the author and playwright J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan.

Their setting of English-language verse to old Irish tunes marked the transition in popular Irish culture from Irish to English. Politically, Moore was recognised in England as a press, or \"squib\", writer for the aristocratic Whigs; in Ireland he was accounted a Catholic patriot. Married to a Protestant actress and hailed as \"Anacreon Moore\" after the classical Greek composer of drinking songs and erotic verse, Moore did not profess religious piety. Yet in the controversies that surrounded Catholic Emancipation Moore was seen to defend the tradition of the Church in Ireland against both evangelising Protestants and uncompromising lay Catholics. Longer prose works reveal more radical sympathies. The Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald depicts the United Irish leader as a martyr in the cause of democratic reform. Complementing Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent, Memoirs of Captain Rock is a saga, not of Anglo-Irish landowners, but of their exhausted tenants driven to the semi-insurrection of \"Whiteboyism\". Today, however, Moore is remembered almost alone either for his Irish Melodies (typically \"The Minstrel Boy\" and \"The Last Rose of Summer\") or, less generously, for the role he is thought to have played in the loss of the memoirs of his friend Lord Byron.", "In Paris, Moore was joined by Bessy and the children. His social life was busy, often involving meetings with Irish and British and travellers such as Maria Edgeworth and William Wordsworth. But his attempt to bridge the gulf in his connections between his exiled fellow countrymen and members of the British establishment was not always successful. In 1821, several emigres, prominent among them Myles Byrne (veteran of Vinegar Hill and of Napoleon's Irish Legion) refused to attend a St Patrick's day dinner Moore had organised in Paris because of the presiding presence of Wellesley Pole Long, a nephew of the Duke of Wellington.", "The Memoirs relate the history of Ireland as told by a contemporary, the scion of a Catholic family that lost land in successive English settlements. The character, Captain Rock, is fictional but the history is in earnest.  When it catches up with the narrator in the late Penal Law era, his family has been reduced to the \"class of wretched cottiers\". Exposed to the voracious demands of spendthrift Anglo-Irish landlords (pilloried by Maria Edgeworth), both father and son assume captaincies among the \"White-boys, Oak-boys, and Hearts-of Steel\", the tenant conspiracies that attack tax collectors, terrorise the landlords' agents and violently resist evictions.from Memoirs of Captain Rock, Book the Second, Chapter I, "]}, {"page": "English novel", "response": ["Among more minor novelists in this period Maria Edgeworth (1768\u20131849) and Thomas Love Peacock (1785\u20131866) are worthy of comment.
