This was the famous match at Old Trafford which England lost by 3 runs, and with it the series. Tate had the misfortune to drop a crucial swerving lofted pull off the left-handed Australian captain, Joe Darling, the bowler being the leg-spinner Len Braund from the now Brian Statham End: just forward of square leg, in front of the refreshment stall (the bowler's testimony, and photos locate the structure), slightly in from the boundary, rail/tram-line side of the ground. England lost their ninth wicket in their second innings  with eight wanted for victory. Tate joined Wilfred Rhodes and edged his first ball for four, but the fourth ball he received from Saunders bowled him. The patch of turf on which Tate dropped the catch is now in the pavilion lawn at Whalley Range Cricket Club, after Old Trafford lifted its playing area in August 2008, as is that where Clem Hill took his famous running catch in front of the pavilion in the same game. The England captain, Archie MacLaren, was born in Whalley Range and grew up there.\nHis first-class career with Sussex lasted from 1887 to 1905. Bowling off-spin at a brisk pace, he took 1331 first-class wickets at 21.55, with best innings figures of 9-73. After his playing career had ended, he became the coach at Derbyshire.One of Tate's sons, Maurice, also played Test cricket. Another, Cecil Tate, played first-class cricket.\nAfter his cricket career, Tate ran a pub in Derby until 1937. He died in poverty in 1943.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 24", "response": ["*  1867   \u2013 Fred Tate, English cricketer and coach (d. 1943)"]}, {"page": "Ranjitsinhji", "response": ["Ranjitsinhji returned to England in mid-May and immediately resumed the captaincy of Sussex. However, a succession of low scores and uncertain performances suggested that he was neither mentally nor physically fit for cricket and Simon Wilde writes that his failure to secure support in India and the continued pressure of threatened bankruptcy placed him in a difficult situation. The Australian cricket team was touring England once more and Ranjitsinhji, having played against the team for the MCC, was selected for the first Test. However, he seemed to be nervous and struggled to concentrate, running out his captain, Archie MacLaren before he was out himself for 13. Wisden noted: \"a misunderstanding, for which Ranjitsinhji considered himself somewhat unjustly blamed, led to MacLaren being run out, and then Ranjitsinhji himself quite upset by what had happened, was clean bowled\". Although he scored 135 for Sussex shortly afterwards, in the second Test he was out without scoring. Over the next few weeks, Ranjitsinhji made good starts to several innings but lost his wicket to uncharacteristic lapses and leg-break bowlers continued to trouble him. He missed several matches, far more than he had missed in other seasons. However, in favourable batting circumstances he played two large innings in this period, hitting 230 against Essex and 234 against Surrey. An injury in the former game caused Ranjitsinhji to miss the third Test, lost by England, although his lack of confidence may have played a part in his decision. He returned for the fourth Test which England narrowly lost. However, he faced serious distractions from his parlous financial situation as one of his creditors presented him with a demand for payment shortly before the game. Ranjitsinhji claimed  after the match, falsely, that Pratap Singh intended to pay the debt but needed approval from the India Office, but it is likely that Ranjitsinhji anticipated another petition in bankruptcy going before a court and that this affected his performance in the Test. Showing signs of nerves, and never looking comfortable while batting, Ranjitsinhji scored 2 runs in the first innings and 4 in the second. In the latter innings, when England had a relatively small target to chase for victory, he looked to have lost all confidence and could have been dismissed several times; the Australian players thought he played more poorly than they had ever seen. His lack of belief may also have contributed to the defeat, as Fred Tate notoriously dropped an important catch fielding, according to Simon Wilde, in a position which  Ranjitsinhji was more likely to fill in normal circumstances. Wilde writes: \"[Several members of the team] failed to play their part, notably Ranji, whose abject performance was in marked contrast to his former days of splendour. The real reason for his poor performance has remained the knowledge of only a very few. At the time, a polite veil was drawn over his failure, but he was never to play for England again.\" In 15 Test matches, all against Australia, he scored 989 runs at an average of 44.96."]}, {"page": "Albert Trott", "response": ["He was at the peak of his powers as an all-rounder in 1899 and 1900.  In 1899 he scored 1,175 first-class runs and took 239 wickets, and in 1900 he scored at 1,337 runs and took 211 wickets. Trott's penchant for the spectacular did not fail him: having already landed the ball on the pavilion balcony at Lord's in the match, he became the only batsman to hit a ball over the current Lord's pavilion, bludgeoning Monty Noble out of the ground on 31 July 1899.Scorecard, MCC v Australians, Lord's, 1899 The ball hit a chimney and fell into the garden outside the house of Philip Need, the Lord's dressing room attendant.

MacLaren favoured Jessop's inclusion but the selectors considered him unreliable.Down (1981), p. 87. Although Barnes was not fully fit, later commentators suggested the selectors omitted him because of MacLaren's actions at Sheffield. A further player was added to the squad in case the pitch was affected by rain before the match, but rather than choosing Haigh, the leading wet-pitch bowler in the country,Down (1981), p. 88. Hawke insisted that Sussex's Fred Tate was included\u2014critics have suggested that Hawke wanted to prevent Haigh's absence from the Yorkshire team, of which Hawke was captain, given the unlikeliness of the extra bowler being needed. According to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, when MacLaren saw the list of players in the team, he responded: \"My God, look what they've sent me\". MacLaren was angry with Hawke, and when it rained before the match, included Tate in the final eleven at the expense of George Hirst, a leading all-rounder.Gibson, p. 87. Gibson suggests that Tate was included by the selectors only \"because they thought MacLaren could not possibly pick him\" and so he could not make any further late changes to the team; MacLaren, according to Gibson, in turn included Tate out of spite. Other writers have suggested that MacLaren, as a Lancastrian, preferred a Sussex player to a Yorkshire one.Whimpress and Hart, p. 51."]}, {"page": "List of International cricket families", "response": ["* Fred Tate"]}, {"page": "Maurice Tate", "response": ["The son of Sussex off spinner Fred Tate and nicknamed \"Chubby\", Maurice began his career for Sussex as a hard-hitting batsman and spin bowler with one match in 1912.

In the following two years, Tate's batting developed further with a double hundred against Northamptonshire in 1921 representing his highest first-class score.

Although he failed at Sheffield, Hirst was the leading all-rounder in England and thus unlikely to be left out of the team. However, the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was engaged in a dispute with the team selectors over the composition of his side. He was given only 12 players to choose from for the fourth Test. Fred Tate was one of the twelve and the selectors probably included him as they believed MacLaren could not possibly choose him in the final eleven over another player and so would be forced to field the side they wanted. MacLaren responded by dropping Hirst to play Tate, out of anger towards the selectors. The pitch was soft, which would have favoured the bowling of Tate, but Wisden reported that while this offered some justification for dropping Hirst, \"it meant playing a bowler pure and simple in preference to a first-rate all-round man, and the result proved anything but happy.\" Tate bowled just 16 overs in the game, dropped a vital catch and was the last man out as Australia won the match by three runs, giving them an unassailable lead in the series; later writers claimed that Tate's performance was responsible for losing the match."]}, {"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["Palairet was selected to appear for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the touring Australians in the week prior to the first Test of the series.

Palairet, Ranjitsinhji and Fred Tate replaced Fry, George Hirst and Gilbert Jessop; the Wisden match report indicates that dropping Fry was a necessary decision, but that Hirst and Jessop should both have played.Green (1980), pp. 29\u201332. In A History of Cricket, Altham is more direct in claiming that Palairet should not have been chosen: \"The selectors, it is now agreed, made a questionable choice in preferring Lionel Palairet to an all-rounder such as Hirst.\"Altham, Swanton (1938), p. 245. On his Test debut, Palairet opened the batting and scored six runs in the first innings, one of five victims to fall to Jack Saunders and Hugh Trumble in the first 45 minutes of England's innings. In the second innings, Palairet once again opened, though with a different partner: MacLaren replaced Bobby Abel. The pair made scored 44 runs together, though Wisden noted that \"the difficulty they experienced in playing the bowling made one apprehensive\". Palairet was bowled by Saunders, and England were eventually dismissed for 120, four runs short of victory."]}, {"page": "Stan Worthington", "response": ["Worthington was born at Bolsover, Derbyshire and went to Netherthorpe Grammar School, Staveley, Derbyshire.

Jackson then kept the scoring rate going, making 128, the highest score of the game, and England's total increased by 77 before he was finally out, 24 of them contributed by the lower-order batsmen, who were out to Noble and Trumble. England thus trailed by 37 on first innings, having been given some runs when Gregory missed \"the simplest of chances\" at cover point, but Australia were undone by Lockwood's bowling. He took the new ball, removed Trumper, Hill and Duff, and Australia were ten for three. Six more runs were added before the left-handed Darling hit a catch to deep square leg on the railway side, where Palairet would normally have fielded.
