She is emeritus professor of English at Birkbeck, University of London and a senior research fellow of the Institute of English Studies at the University of London.  She is a fellow of the British Academy. She has been a visiting scholar at many institutions, including at Princeton University in 2016-2017. She is also a published poet.\nArmstrong is a critic of nineteenth-century poetry, literature and women's writing. Her publications include Novel Politics: Democratic Imaginations in Nineteenth-Century Fiction (2017), The Radical Aesthetic (2000), Women's Poetry, Late Romantic to Late Victorian: Gender and Genre (1999) and Victorian Poetry: Poetry, Politics and Poetics (1993). Her book Victorian Glassworlds: Glass Culture and the Imagination (2008) won the Modern Language Association's James Russell Lowell Prize.In Victorian Poetry: Poetry, Politics and Poetics, Armstrong contends that poems by women can speak double, using conventionally feminine modes as a \u201cway of looking at conformity from within.\u201d Armstrong uses Adelaide Procter as an exemplar, naming her as someone who \u201ctypifies the woman poet's interests at the time.\u201d In her poetry in the English Woman\u2019s Journal as well as in Charles Dickens\u2019 magazine Household Words, Procter deploys \u201coften simple, often pious, often conventional\u201d modes of address. However, \u201cthose conventions are subjected to investigation, questioned, or used for unexpected purposes.\u201dPossession: A Romance, the 1990 Booker Prize-winning novel by A. S.

The few critics who have examined Procter's poetry generally find it important for the way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them. According to Isobel Armstrong, Procter's poetry, like that of many 19th-century women poets, employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety.Armstrong (1996), 251, 265. Francis O'Gorman cites \"A Legend of Provence\" as an example of a poem with this kind of \"double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm.\"O'Gorman (2004), 320. Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter's poetry, while ladylike on the surface, shows signs of repressed emotions and desires.Hoeckley (2007), 130; Mason (2006), 88. Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful,Blair (2004), 135. and Gill Gregory argues that Procter's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way, while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires.Gregory (1996), 89.

Arthur Symons also remarked on the way that Browning writes in a \"deliberate and reflective\" way.
