He was the son of Dickie Baugh who also represented the former.\nBaugh began his career with the Wolverhampton-based Stafford Road before joining Wolves in August 1918. With league football suspended due to World War I until the following year, he had to wait until 18 October 1919 to make his debut, in a 0\u20131 defeat to Bury.\nHe battled for his spot in defence with Jackery Jones over his first seasons, but played every round of the club's route to the 1921 FA Cup Final. However, Baugh was injured in the weeks leading up to the game and missed their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. With Jones having retired at the end of the season, Baugh made the spot his own and was a near ever-present over the next season and-a-half until suffering injury.\nBaugh remained on the club's books until June 1924 when he moved to their rivals West Bromwich Albion after making 120 appearances in total for Wolves. He made his Albion debut in February 1925 in a First Division match against Preston North End. In May 1929 he joined Exeter City, before a transfer to Kidderminster Harriers in January 1932. He remained with Kidderminster until his retirement from football in April 1936.\nHe died in 1972.", "link_mentions": []}}
