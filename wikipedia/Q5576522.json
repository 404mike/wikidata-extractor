It was jointly created by Godfrey Philipp, who produced the series, and actor-writer John Michael Howson, who also co-starred in the show. It typically aired from Monday to Friday and each story would stretch across a full week, reaching a resolution on Friday.Albert Moran, Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, AFTRS 1993 p 42", "Adventure Island was a joint production of Godfrey Philipp Productions and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, pre-recorded on videotape at the ABC's studios in Ripponlea, Melbourne. It is believed to be the first program made by the ABC in collaboration with an outside production company. Production was usually five weeks ahead of broadcast.  It was a pantomime-style series set in the kingdom of Diddley-Dum-Diddley. The show was hosted by Nancy Cato (a cousin of the noted author of the same name) from 1967 to 1968 (her final pre-recorded episodes aired at the beginning of 1969) and Sue Donovan from 1969 to 1972.", "*For his contribution to Australian children's television, Godfrey Philipp won a special Logie award in 1973.  (In 1979, Godfrey's programme Rainbow won a further Logie for Outstanding Contribution To Children's TV.)", "The show's axing, announced in mid-1972, was highly controversial\u2014not least because it was replaced by the American program  Sesame Street\u2014and an unprecedented flood of public protest ensued. A group of MPs headed by David Kennedy launched a \"Save Adventure Island\" campaign during which questions were asked in Parliament. However the campaign was unsuccessful and the final episode, number 1175, aired on 22 December 1972. Godfrey Philipp had been the mastermind behind the Australian Labor Party's successful \"It's Time\" campaign, which in 1972 brought about a change in government in Australia for the first time in 22 years, so the decision to cancel Adventure Island may have been politically rather than economically motivated.", "* The Magic Man: vale, Godfrey Philipp, long live Adventure Island, Beth Spencer, ABC The Drum, 23 Jun 2011."]}, {"page": "John-Michael Howson", "response": ["He became primarily known in television for his involvement in the acclaimed ATV-0 children's fantasy television series The Magic Circle Club (1965\u201367) in which he played Fee Fee Bear (his face never seen on camera due to the bear suit), and as Clown in the follow-up ABC show Adventure Island,  (1967\u201372). Howson, with Godfrey Philipp, was co-creator of both shows. Howson wrote the vast bulk of the scripts (five 30-minute shows per week) and the lyrics to the original songs used in them, the music usually composed by Bruce Rowland. Owing to Howson's intense workload, many of the Adventure Island scripts were written on a typewriter positioned behind the set. Howson also contributed scripts and sketches to Graham Kennedy's In Melbourne Tonight and to The Mavis Bramston Show. His 1965 Bramston \"Flower arranging\" sketch - in which a section of Constance Spry's definitive text book on the subject is quoted verbatim in a lascivious manner by the Chief Censor (Gordon Chater) to hilarious and scandalous effect - created a national uproar and remains a television classic."]}, {"page": "Magic Circle Club", "response": ["Godfrey Philipp was the producer and director, with many scripts and song lyrics by John-Michael Howson.
