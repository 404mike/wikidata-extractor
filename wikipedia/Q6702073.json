He is most commonly known as 'Jocko'. Johnson began his music career in the late 1990s drumming for a spree of small local West Midlands- punk and metal bands. In early 2003 Johnson was approached by California punk band Amen to join the ranks. After his departure from Amen in 2005, Johnson formed Beat Union as drummer and songwriter with Dave Warsop, Dean Ashton and Mark Andrews. Johnson joined the Welsh alternative metal band Lostprophets in 2009 until their disbanding in 2013. Johnson has also been involved in other musical projects, including working alongside Producer John Feldmann (Good Charlotte, The Used, Kelly Clarkson) and has performed session work for a variety of bands, including The Wonder Stuff and Foxy Shazam.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Redditch", "response": ["*Luke Johnson, musician, Lostprophets was born in Redditch."]}, {"page": "Lostprophets", "response": ["The band claimed that The Betrayed is \"by far the finest, darkest and most real album\" of their career. Originally, Ian Watkins stated he wanted the new album to be \"nastier\" and \"darker\" than previous efforts, with more energy and vibe than before. In a blog post, guitarist Mike Lewis suggested that Ilan Rubin (who subsequently left the band to join Nine Inch Nails) was very much a large part of the writing/recording process. Following Rubin's departure, Luke Johnson of Beat Union was officially announced as the band's new drummer in August 2009. During this time, Kerrang! published a \"world exclusive\" article on Lostprophets, revealing the album's title, and its release date of January 2010. In a later interview with Kerrang in early 2009, Watkins stated that the record was \"the most honest album\" the band has ever done, and that overall the record was \"a lot grittier and sleazier\", while also stating that did not mean \"it won't be catchy\", but that it would not be done \"in such a twee way\". When speaking about what the record would sound like, Jamie Oliver stated that he felt it had \"the bite that Start Something had, with the song-ability of Liberation Transmission but personality of The Fake Sound of Progress\".", "* Luke Johnson \u2013 drums, percussion (2009\u201313)", " bar:Johnson    text:\"Luke Johnson\""]}, {"page": "Luke Johnson", "response": ["Luke Johnson may refer to:", "* Luke Johnson (businessman) (born 1962), British businessman and former chairman of the British Channel 4", "* Luke Johnson (game designer), American game designer of role-playing games", "* Luke Johnson (Mormon) (1807\u20131861), American leader in the Latter Day Saint movement", "* Luke Johnson (musician) (born 1981), former drummer for the Welsh band Lostprophets", "* Luke Johnson, inventor of the Luke Johnson Phone Experiment on YouTube", "* Luke Johnson (ice hockey) (born 1994), professional ice hockey player", "* Luke Johnson (tennis) (born 1994), British tennis player"]}, {"page": "Amen (American band)", "response": ["In 2003, Chaos worked with Daron Malakian of System of a Down on a demo tape for his project Scars on Broadway.
