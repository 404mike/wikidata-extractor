Alec Motyer, was an Irish biblical scholar. He was Vice-Principal of Clifton Theological College and vicar of St. Luke's, Hampstead, and Christ Church, Westbourne (Bournemouth) (1981\u20131989), before becoming Principal of Trinity College, Bristol. He spent his later years in Poynton, Cheshire.\nMotyer was born in Dublin on 30 August 1924 and educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he received Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Bachelor of Divinity degrees. He trained to become an Anglican minister at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford.\nTremper Longman III describes him as a \"competent and popular expositor\", while Tim Keller has said that Motyer and Edmund Clowney were \"the fathers of my preaching ministry\". By contrast, Motyer's own opinion of himself was, \"I\u2019m not really a scholar. I\u2019m just a man who loves the Word of God.\u201dHe died on 26 August 2016.", "link_mentions": {}}}
