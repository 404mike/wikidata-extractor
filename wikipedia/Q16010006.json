On the opening day of the 1921\u201322 season, Tommy Winship crossed for Bill Hooper to score Darlington's first Football League goal, against Halifax Town; the goal came so quickly that the Northern Echo reported how Hooper could \"in all probability, lay claim to the honour of being the first player to score a goal in the Northern Section of the Third Division\". Hughie Dickson scored the second with a penalty kick to make the score 2\u20130, and George Malcolm, the club's first Football League captain, and Tommy Greaves also played in the match. Dan Cassidy scored the last-seconds winner to defeat Stockport County in the inaugural Northern Section Cup final in 1934. Dave Carr and Keith Morton scored two of the goals that earned Darlington a draw with Chelsea, League champions only three seasons earlier, in the fourth round of the 1958\u201359 FA Cup, and Carr scored again as Darlington won the replay 4\u20131 to progress to the last 16 of the competition for only the second time in their history.

According to the Northern Echo, Winship was the best player on the field: \"time and again he got away down the wing and sent across some lovely centres\". He provided numerous assists over the season, including one cross that confused Wrexham defenders into giving away an own goal, and scored goals as well, including two in a 7\u20133 defeat of Durham City, as Darlington finished in second place."]}, {"page": "Fred Colling", "response": ["Colling was born in Crook, County Durham, one of several children of Henry Colling, a coal miner, and his wife Sarah Jane.

After Darlington's election to the newly formed Northern Section of the Football League's third tier, Colling began the 1921\u201322 season in the club's reserve team, which took the place of the senior team in the North-Eastern League. He made his Football League debut in the fourth match of the campaign, on 17 September away to Chesterfield, replacing Bill Hooper at inside right.

Hooper resumed for the next match, and Colling played only once more for Darlington in the League."]}]}}
