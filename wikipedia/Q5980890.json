He is now Professor Emeritus, after retiring from Full Professor of Music, at Columbia University and Honorary Professor in the History of Music Theory at the University of Cambridge.He took the BA (1961), MusB (1962), and PhD (1969) all from the University of Cambridge before serving as a lecturer at King's College, London in 1965, a professor at the University of Nottingham in 1975, and Columbia University in 1986. His earliest research dealt with the early history of the English Chapel Royal, but later he turned to the history of theory and analysis, and is now a historian of music theory.He is the editor (since 1991) of the Cambridge Studies in Music Theory and Analysis series and an area editor for the second edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Music. As of 2011, he is the director of Schenker Documents Online.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music theory", "response": ["Musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question how does this music work?

It delimits a tonal space for elaboration, but lacks the melodic dimension that would allow further developments: it \"remains a harmonic phenomenon\".Heinrich Schenker, \"Elucidations\", Der Tonwille 8\u20139, English translation, vol. II, p. 117 (translation by Ian Bent) From the very structure of triads (chords), it follows that arpeggiations remain disjunct and that any filling of their space involves conjunct motion. Schenker distinguishes two types of filling of the tonal space: 1) neighbor notes (Nebennoten), ornamenting one single note of the triad by being adjacent to it. These are sometimes referred to generically as \"adjacencies\";", "The most elementary linear progressions are determined by the tonal space that they elaborate: they span from the prime to the third, from the third to the fifth or from the fifth to the octave of the triad, in ascending or descending direction. Schenker writes: \"there are no other tonal spaces than those of 1\u20133, 3\u20135, and 5\u20138. There is no origin for passing-tone- progressions, or for melody\"\"Erl\u00e4uterungen\", Der Tonwille 8\u20139, English translation, vol. I, p. 117 (translation by Ian Bent). Linear progressions, in other words, may be either third progressions (Terzz\u00fcge) or fourth progressions (Quartz\u00fcge); larger progressions result from a combination of these."]}, {"page": "Ian D.
