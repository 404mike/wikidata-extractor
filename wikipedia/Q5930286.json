In 1994, he left the SDLP, after accepting an MBE, claiming that some in the party had ostracised him for accepting a British honour.  He stood in Upper Bann as a Labour coalition candidate for the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996, heading a list which took only 512 votes.Although no Labour coalition members were directly elected, as the tenth most successful party in the election, they were entitled to two seats in the Forum.  These were allocated to Casey and Malachi Curran.  In the same year, he became the first Catholic Mayor of Craigavon.The Coalition soon disintegrated.  Casey stood as an independent Labour candidate in the 1997 local elections, but lost his seat in Craigavon.  He did not stand for the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998, but did canvass for the Labour Party of Northern Ireland.When the composition of the Northern Ireland Policing Board was first revealed in 1998, Casey was named as a member.  From 2003, he sat on the County Armagh District Policing Partnership, and received death threats believed to be from dissident republicans.  He later served as a member of Craigavon District Policing Partnership.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Craigavon Borough Council", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Hugh Casey", "|Hugh Casey", "|Hugh Casey"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|Malachi Curran, Hugh Casey, Mark Langhammer, John McLaughlin, Lucy Simpson, Peter Hadden, Margaret Lawrence, Fionnuala Harbinson, Michael Duffy, David Morrison"]}, {"page": "Labour coalition", "response": ["The coalition gained only 6,425 votes (0.85% of the total), winning no seats, but as the tenth most successful grouping in the election, it was entitled to two \"top-up\" seats on the Forum.The 1996 Forum Elections and the Peace Process, ARK The seats were taken by the first two named on the Regional List of Candidates, Malachi Curran and Hugh Casey.The 1996 Forum Elections: Regional List of Candidates ARK - Access Research Knowledge Both were former Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillors."]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|Hugh Casey", "|Hugh Casey"]}, {"page": "Upper Bann (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Hugh CaseyAlan EvansWilliam WhiteMary Sheen"]}, {"page": "Malachi Curran", "response": ["He resigned from the SDLP to stand as a Labour coalition candidate for the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996.
