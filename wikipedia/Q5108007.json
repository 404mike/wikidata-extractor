He was born at Ascot, Berkshire and educated at Bedford School. After leaving Bedford School, where he had played cricket for the school alongside Alastair Cook, following his A Levels in 2000, Shankar proceeded to read law at Cambridge University.  It was for the university cricket club that he made his first-class debut against Middlesex in 2002.  Shankar played first-class cricket for the university from 2002 to 2005, playing his final first-class match against Oxford University, while on occasion he captained the university.  Shankar played 12 first-class matches for the University, scoring 384 runs at an average of 27.42.  His one innings of note came against Oxford University in 2002, when he scored 143 runs from 297 balls, before being dismissed by Stephen Hawinkels.  This was Shankar's only first-class century and was the only time he passed fifty.  The bowling in the match was later described by Cambridge University coach Chris Scott as \"utterly bad\".", "Shankar's deception had begun at Lancashire, with Shankar claiming his age was 23.  Upon his signing with the county, Lancashire released a press statement which stated the Cambridge University coach referring to him as one of the finest young players the university side had seen since John Crawley.  Chris Scott contacted Lancashire to deny having made such a claim, saying \"I phoned Lancashire and made it clear that I'd never said anything of the sort\", before going on to say \"He was a poor player and there's no way I would have recommended him.\"  In response to the situation, Bedfordshire president Mike Green had to say \"Frankly we [Bedfordshire] were amazed when we found out he was signing for Worcestershire because he would have struggled to get into our side. He hadn\u2019t been good enough to get into our first XI for a good six or seven years.\""]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994", "response": ["Durham won the toss and on an easy paced pitch chose to bat first. After both openers were dismissed inside the first 75 minutes, number three John Morris shared century partnerships with Stewart Hutton (61) and Phil Bainbridge (67). Morris was dismissed early on the second day but his innings of 204 was the highest by a Durham player at the time, it was also his first century for Durham since moving from Derbyshire. An eighth wicket stand of 134 between Anderson Cummins  (62) and David Graveney (65*) boosted the total before a mid-afternoon declaration. The early wicket of Dominic Ostler brought Brian Lara to the crease, dropped on 18 by wicket-keeper Chris Scott at the close Lara was 111 not out and had become the first player to score seven centuries in eight innings. The third day of the match was rained off and with the captains unable to agree on a target, Lara had free rein to bat on. He took the opportunity by scoring 174 runs in the pre-lunch session, in the afternoon he added a further 133 and in the process beat the previous best by a Warwickshire player (305* by Frank Foster) and passed 1,000 runs for the season in only his seventh innings. After tea he passed Archie MacLaren's 424, the highest score in England, and progressed to 497 by the time of the final over. Still two runs short of the first-class record, Lara was made aware it was the last over of the match by batting partner Keith Piper after the fourth ball, the next delivery was driven for four to break the record. Lara's innings took 427 balls and lasted less than eight hours. He broke the records for most boundaries in an innings (72) and most runs in a single day (390). Trevor Penney contributed just 44 to a third wicket partnership of 314 with Lara while the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership between Lara and Piper was worth 322. The team total of 810/4 bettered the county record by over 150 runs."]}, {"page": "Christopher Scott (cricketer, born 1964)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Scott (cricketer, born 1964)"]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Chris Scott (1991\u20131996) : C.
