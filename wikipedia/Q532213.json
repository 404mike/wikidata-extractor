It is based on the 2001 novel The Dark Room by Rachel Seiffert. In south-west Germany, during the aftermath of World War II, five destitute siblings must travel  to their grandmother's home by the Bay of Husum near Hamburg after their high-level Nazi parents disappear in danger of arrest by Allied occupation authorities. Along the way, they encounter a variety of other Germans, some of whom are helpful while others are antagonistic. Eventually they meet up with a young man presenting himself as Thomas, a young Jewish concentration camp survivor, who joins their group and becomes their unofficial guardian.", "The producer Paul Welsh, secured the film rights to Rachel Seiffert's novel very early and asked Robin Mukherjee to write an adaptation for the cinema. When the director Cate Shortland joined the project she re-wrote part of the screenplay to make it fit her way of working. At a later stage, it was agreed that most of the dialogue should be in German, which delayed the production for a year and forced one of the British funding institutions to back out, as its rules didn't allow backing of non-English language films.Scriptangel's Blog, 2 July 2013: Screenwriter Interview \u2013 Robin Mukherjee Linked 2015-12-09"]}, {"page": "The Dark Room (Seiffert novel)", "response": ["The Dark Room (2001) is a novel by British writer Rachel Seiffert."]}, {"page": "Albrecht Knaus Verlag", "response": ["*Rachel Seiffert"]}, {"page": "2017 in literature", "response": ["*Rachel Seiffert \u2013 A Boy in Winter (June 1, UK)"]}, {"page": "Lennie Goodings", "response": ["Her authors include Margaret Atwood, Maya Angelou, Sandi Toksvig, Sarah Dunant, Sarah Waters, Naomi Wolf, Linda Grant, Natasha Walter, Lyndall Gordon, Shirley Hazzard, Joan Bakewell, Shirley Williams, Rachel Seiffert and Marilynne Robinson."]}, {"page": "Seiffert (surname)", "response": ["* Rachel Seiffert (born 1971), British novelist"]}]}}
