Mrs. Robson was born in Liverpool, studied art at the Southport School of Fine Arts, Lancashire, and design for the theatre at the Wimbledon College of Art. She is now based in London. The inspiration for her monster and costume designs comes from many sources, such as Russian ballet and Memento mori statues. Mrs. Robson worked for a time under the fashion designer Mary Quant and her style continues to reflect the clarity and directness of fashion drawing.
