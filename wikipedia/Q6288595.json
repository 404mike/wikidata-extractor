Appignanesi is best known for the feature film Song of Songs (2006), starring Natalie Press, which he directed, co-wrote and co-produced.

Made on a tiny budget, the film is a dark study of the intense relationship between a brother and highly religious sister in London's Orthodox Jewish community. The film had a small, arthouse UK release but received critical acclaim; The Observer said it \"reveals a distinctive and bold new voice in British cinema.\" He has written and directed several short films, most notably Ex Memoria (2006) which also stars Natalie Press as well as Sara Kestelman in a study of a woman with Alzheimer's disease, funded by the Wellcome Trust; and Nine 1/2 Minutes (2003), a romantic comedy starring David Tennant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Klezmer", "response": ["* The Reluctant Infidel (2010), directed by Josh Appignanesi"]}, {"page": "Lisa Appignanesi", "response": ["She studied at McGill University in Montreal, where she was a features editor for The McGill Daily.
