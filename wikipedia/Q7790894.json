He was a member of the Surrey side that was generally reckoned as Champion County for 1864. His best season with the bat was 1865, when he reached one thousand runs for the only time: 1223 at 29.82.After 1873, he played in only four more first-class matches: one final match for Surrey in 1874, two for the South against the North in 1875, and lastly for United South of England Eleven v United North of England Eleven in a match that began on 13 July 1876.According to David Lemmon, with Harry Jupp he formed the first great opening partnership for Surrey, one which caused \"a sensation\" with \"their bright and attractive cricket, their long partnerships, by their speed between the wickets.\"\n\nHe was known as the Pocket Hercules, because although short he could hit powerfully. He was particularly strong on the off-side, and appeared to have plenty of time to play his shots.He umpired in a number of first-class matches between 1872 and 1877, including some Gentlemen v Players and North v South matches. In 1876, a benefit year at Surrey brought him \u00a3300, however he died two years later from congestion of the lungs in Brookwood Asylum. His brothers John, William and Richard also played first-class cricket.He was the landlord of the Cricketers Inn at Westcott and the Ram Inn and the Jolly Butchers Inn, both in Dorking.He died a lunatic in Brookwood Hospital in 1878 and is buried in the nearby Brookwood Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1865 in sports", "response": ["* Thomas Humphrey is the first batsman to score 1,000 runs in an English first-class season.", "* Most runs \u2013 Thomas Humphrey 1,223 @ 29.82 (HS 106)"]}, {"page": "1867 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Thomas Humphrey 946 @ 26.27 (HS 144)"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Thomas Humphrey"]}, {"page": "Harry Jupp", "response": ["Jupp was born in Dorking, Surrey, and played his earliest cricket for the Wellesley House club in Twickenham.Brief profile of Henry Jupp by Don Ambrose at Cricket Archive Despite not having any experience of first-class cricket took his place in a strong Surrey eleven that was to beat the best of the rest of England in 1864 by nine wickets.Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Rigby A\u2013Z of Cricket Records; p. 53.
