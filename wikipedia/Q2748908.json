They had taken the string galvanometer and adapted it to record signals from microphones onto photographic film.  This work had been done by Lucien Bull and  Charles Nordmann (an astronomer at the Paris observatory). Processing the film took some minutes but this was not a significant drawback because artillery batteries did not move very frequently.  However, the apparatus could not run continuously because of the expenditure of film.  This meant that it had to be switched on when enemy guns fired, which necessitated the deployment of Advanced Posts (AP) in front of the microphones which could switch on the recording apparatus remotely via field cable. These Advanced Posts were connected back to a centrally located Flash Board, and this device enabled the observers to be sure they were all observing the same muzzle flash.  When this had been established they could switch on the recording apparatus."]}, {"page": "1876 in Ireland", "response": ["*5 January \u2013 Lucien Bull, pioneer in chronophotography (died 1972 in France)."]}, {"page": "Bull (surname)", "response": ["* Lucien Bull (1876\u20131972), a pioneer in chronophotography"]}]}}
