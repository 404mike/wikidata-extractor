Those films were shown first in Edison Kinescope knockoffs. In 1896 he showed them projected. That was about the time the Lumi\u00e8re brothers were pioneering projected films in France.His first notably successful scientic device was his Unipivot galvanometer.In 1999 the British film industry erected a commemorative plaque on his building at 44 Hatton Garden, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Film editing", "response": ["The use of film editing to establish continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer Robert W.

In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an art exhibition having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1896 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and multiple exposures. One of the first films to use this technique, Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's The Four Troublesome Heads from 1898, was produced with Paul's camera."]}, {"page": "History of film", "response": ["Cecil Hepworth took this technique further, by printing the negative of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed. To do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image. This arrangement came to be called a \"projection printer\", and eventually an \"optical printer\".The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of Robert W. Paul and Hepworth. Paul shot scenes from On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus (1899) with the camera turning very slowly. When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Hepworth used the opposite effect in The Indian Chief and the Seidlitz Powder (1901). The Chief's movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second. This gives what we would call a \"slow motion\" effect.", "Real film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer Robert W.

In the summer of 1894, it was demonstrated at 20, boulevard Poissonni\u00e8re in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie projection system.Schwartz (1999), p. 183. Burns (1998) says the exhibition took place in August (p. 73); Grieveson and Kr\u00e4mer (2004) say it was September (p. 12). On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London.Musser (1994), p. 82. Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, for instance, claims that Edison \"apparently thought so little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright .\"Griffith and Reed (1971), p. 900. As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison \"balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents\" and \"saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope.\"Rausch (2004), p. 8. Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars.For the cost of the Kinetoscope's development: Millard (1990), p. 148; Spehr (2000), p. 7. For discussion of Edison's decision not to pursue European patents, see, e.g., Braun (1992), pp. 190\u2013191. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer Robert W. Paul to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades\u2013Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology.Rossell (1998), pp. 91\u201394.

Both the launch and the stage collapse were captured on film by E. P. Prestwich and Robert W. Paul. The decision to distribute these films was controversial in its day, sparking one of the earliest debates surrounding videojournalism. Albions completion then was delayed by late delivery of her machinery.  She finally began trials late in 1900, during which she was further delayed by machinery and gun defects, and she was not finally completed until June 1901.
