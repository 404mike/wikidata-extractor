Born in Montserrat, he moved to Wales at the age of nine. He rose to prominence when he won the gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in New Zealand. He turned professional in 1974 and won the Welsh Heavyweight title in 1976 and then followed this with the British title in 1981. He retired in 1983 after a failed defence of his British title.\nMeade was known for his big-hitting style of fighting with very few of his bouts going the distance. Of his 20 professional wins, 18 came via knockout. Despite this ability, Meade lacked motivation in training and during the middle of his career, with his weight reaching above 17 stone, he suffered a lack of form that saw him lose seven out of nine fights. He took on a new trainer, Jimmy Bromfield, in 1979 and this saw a change in his fortune which led to Meade taking the British Heavyweight title.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1974 British Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| rowspan=2 |Heavyweight|| rowspan=2 |Men|| rowspan=2 | Neville Meade|| rowspan=2 | Fatai Ayinla|| Benson Masanda"]}, {"page": "Richard Dunn (boxer)", "response": ["|align=left| Neville Meade"]}, {"page": "1981 in Wales", "response": ["*Boxing - Neville Meade becomes British heavyweight champion."]}, {"page": "Meade (surname)", "response": ["*Neville Meade (1948-2010), British boxer"]}, {"page": "1948 in Wales", "response": ["*12 September (in Jamaica) - Neville Meade, heavyweight boxer (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "David Pearce (boxer)", "response": ["* Pearce suffered two setbacks on his road to the British title.
