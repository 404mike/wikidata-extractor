With 12,000 books in his home, he also admitted to being a bibliophile. Due to his experience as a professional joiner, he made a speciality of the construction industry and its employment practices, but was also concerned with trade union issues in general. He changed his view on the European Common Market from being an outspoken supporter to an outspoken opponent, and served a brief period in government in the mid-1970s. His later career was dominated by his contribution to debates within the Labour Party and he defended the Liverpool City Council.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neil Kinnock", "response": ["One Liverpool MP, Eric Heffer, a member of the NEC left the conference stage in disgust at Kinnock's comments.
