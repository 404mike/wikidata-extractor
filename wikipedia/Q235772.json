She explained how it was essential for the album to be released following Buena's departure, saying: \"When Mutya left, we decided it was even more important, we should do this as closure so we don't have to relive history all the time.\" Group member Heidi Range also reflected upon this, saying: \"When Mutya was still in the band the greatest hits was always planned for this time anyway.
