The road here was originally built as a turnpike road in 1816 and widened to its current state in the early 1970s. All the trees along the route were preserved owing to environmental concerns.

The restaurant opened in September 1960, but the Ministry were unhappy about the services' reputation as a truck-stop, dating back to Blue Boar's popularity with HGV drivers. They consequently redesigned the restaurant in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service, which they hoped would \"lose at least some of the stigma of having been started in 1959 as primarily a commercial driver's facility\".

The Soviets used the photographs to blackmail Vassall into working for them as a spy, initially in the Moscow embassy, and later in London, following his return there in June 1956. He returned to the Admiralty, where he worked first in the Naval Intelligence Division, and then, as the clerical officer assistant to the Private Secretary, in the Private Office of Tam Galbraith, a Conservative Party politician and Civil Lord of the Admiralty. At the time of his arrest he was working in Military Branch II. During his espionage career, Vassall provided the Soviets with several thousand classified documents, including information on British radar, torpedoes, and anti-submarine equipment. His obituary-writer in The Times commented that \"Vassall was never more than a low-level functionary, but there was nothing low-level about the damage he was able to inflict\". Similarly, Chapman Pincher regarded Vassall as \"the classic example of the spy who, while of lowly rank, can inflict enormous damage because of the excellence of his access to secret information\". Pincher continued: \"I am in no doubt that the recruitment and running of Vassall was a major triumph for the K.G.B. He provided information of the highest value to the Soviet defence chiefs in their successful drive to expand and modernise the Red Navy.\"Pincher 1984, pp. 283\u20134.", "The suggestion of an improper relationship between Vassall and Tam Galbraith inspired a memorable sketch on the satirical BBC programme That Was the Week That Was, which was broadcast in 1963, in which Lance Percival played a senior civil servant detecting sexual innuendo in such conventional pleasantries as the salutation \"My Dear Vassall\" at the beginning of a letter."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Tam Galbraith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Tam Galbraith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Tam Galbraith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Tam Galbraith"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Hillhead (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Tam Galbraith"]}, {"page": "Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell", "response": ["He was appointed Solicitor-General by Harold Macmillan in June 1962, following the Night of the Long Knives, receiving the customary knighthood, and served through the prosecution of the spy John Vassall (and subsequent resignation of a junior minister, Tam Galbraith) and the Profumo affair, in which his offer to resign was declined."]}, {"page": "Third Churchill ministry", "response": ["|Tam Galbraith||7 November 1951 \u2013 4 June 1954||\u00a0", "|Tam Galbraith||7 June 1954||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Conservative government, 1957\u20131964", "response": ["|rowspan=3|Civil Lord of the Admiralty||Tam Galbraith||18 January 1957||\u00a0", "|Tam Galbraith||22 October 1959 \u2013 8 November 1962||\u00a0", "|Tam Galbraith||3 May 1963 \u2013 16 October 1964||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Thomas Galloway Dunlop Galbraith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tam Galbraith"]}, {"page": "Galbraith", "response": ["* Tam Galbraith (1917\u20131982), Scottish Conservative and Unionist politician"]}, {"page": "Thomas Galbraith, 1st Baron Strathclyde", "response": ["After serving in the Royal Navy, he became a chartered accountant and practised, 1925\u201370.
