He was succeeded by Tommy Clare, though it was Sam Bennion at the helm when the club left the Second Division and folded at the end of the 1906\u201307 season. Port Vale reformed in the obscurity of the North Staffordshire Federation League and it was Harry Myatt who was next recorded as first-team manager in October 1913. He was soon followed by Tom Holford and Jock Cameron. Vale's first major success was with Tom Morgan, who managed the club to the Third Division North title in the 1929\u201330 season, though he had simply carried on the work of Joe Schofield, who died on 29 September 1929 after over nine years in the post. Morgan was replaced by former manager Tom Holford in June 1932, who led the club to a record high finish of eighth in the Second Division in 1933\u201334. He was however sacked in September 1935 and not replaced, as the club reverted to selection by committee. Following relegation, the club appointed former England full-back Warney Cresswell as manager-coach in May 1936. He lasted just one season and Tom Morgan was reinstated in December 1937, who tendered his resignation shortly before World War II in April 1939."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["Burslem Port Vale were awaiting liquidation and were no longer in operation, eventually being wound up in 1909. The club's history would have ended at this point, had it not been for an unexpected twist. North Staffordshire Church League champions Cobridge Church were accepted into the North Staffordshire Federation League, still a very minor league. Joint-secretaries Millward and E.C.Brundrett had very big ambitions however. In 1907, they sought permission from the Football Association to change the club's name to Port Vale and bought the old club's ground (the Athletic Ground). To signify their roots they renamed their reserve side to Cobridge Church. Port Vale were now playing teams such as Leek United, Newchapel United and Ashwood Villa. However their fifth-placed finish encouraged the club to apply, successfully, for membership of the North Staffordshire & District League. Financial pressures soon affected the lowly club, and in December 1908, former Vale player Sam Bennion led a buy-out consortium. Former players Adrian Copes, Bert Eardley and Harry Croxton were re-signed and the future looked bright."]}]}}
