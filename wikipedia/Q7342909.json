A modest sum of INR 100 had been collected and a small plot had been allotted at the corner of the parade grounds. This initial plan was however rejected by the Church Building Society in Madras, as being too small, and a design drawn up Robert Chisholm, Consulting Architect, Madras Government was suggested as the alternate. After this Pettigrew left for the Nilgiris and returned after 2 years and found there was no progress in building the church. A decision was made to build the church with private contributions, with the estimated cost being INR 10,000. On 27 November 1869, the foundation stone was laid. The building project however faced much difficulties, financially and also otherwise. However, after the scaffolding, the community stepped up. Donations were made towards the altar, altar cross, vestments, font, pulpit, and communion plate. The Principal of Cooper's Hill College donated the rose window in memory of his child. The exterior of the building was completed for INR 2,000 lower than the original estimate. As, Bishop Waller was on sick leave in England, Bishop Milman who was visiting, consecrated the church on 17 October 1870.
