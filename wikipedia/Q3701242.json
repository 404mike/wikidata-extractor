Campese's Australia qualified for Group F which also consisted of South Africa, New Zealand and England. Australia defeated South Africa 7\u20135 in their opening match of the group. Campese was instrumental in Australia's only try of the game. Australian player Jim Fenwicke was driven back in a tackle and he lofted the ball to Campese in support. South African fullback Andr\u00e9 Joubert rushed up and attempted to intercept the floating ball which opened a gap for Campese, who ran from his own quarter and into the South African half. Chester Williams attempted to ankle-tap Campese but missed. Campese attempted to run around Joost van der Westhuizen and occupied him with a goose-step before he passed in-field to John Flett. Flett made a diagonal run toward the posts, but was tackled just before he could score, before he found Matt Burke in support who scored next to the posts. Michael Lynagh converted the try to give Australia a 7\u20130 lead. However, South Africa responded when Andr\u00e9 Joubert scored an unconverted try. The score remained 7-5 and Australia emerged victorious. The Australians then lost their next group game against New Zealand 42\u20130. Australia needed to defeat England in their final group stage to progress to the semi-finals of the tournament. Campese scored in the first minute of the game when he fielded a kick from Nick Beal. Campese beat Beal on the inside and then made a run along the side-line where he avoided an attempted ankle-tap from Matt Dawson, outflanked Tim Rodber and scored the try untouched. Ryan Constable added another try to give Australia a 14\u20130 lead. In the final play before halftime, England's Justyn Cassell scored a try from some loose line-out ball, which Nick Beal failed to convert, giving Australia a 14-5 halftime lead. Dave Scully scored a try for England after picking up a loose ball from \"broken-play\" to reduce Australia's lead to 14\u201312. However, Campese responded by occupying the England number 7 (possibly Damian Hopley) with a goose-step, which created an overlap for Semi Taupeaafe who scored the final try of the game untouched. Australia won the last quarter-final pool game against England 21\u201312."]}, {"page": "The Varsity Match", "response": ["* \u00a0Damian Hopley (Centre, Cambridge)."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Damian Hopley (1970\u2013), England rugby team, and Chief Executive of Professional Rugby Players' Association"]}, {"page": "National Schools Sevens", "response": ["*Damian Hopley (St Benedict's, 1982)"]}, {"page": "Max Brito", "response": ["After the accident, Brito was given treatment and compensation, which was funded by all sides competing at the 1995 Rugby World Cup.
