During June 2010, Paul Dickov was named as Oldham Athletic player-manager signing a one-year contract. On 3 February 2013, he left his role as manager despite having recently knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup the previous week.

Because it failed to agree a creditors voluntary agreement (CVA), the club was expelled from the Football Association and was eventually wound up in the High Court. DFC 1883 Limited immediately formed a new club. Because the club proposed to play at a ground without the required grading for the Northern Premier League, the new club was placed in the Northern League Division One, by the Football Association. Martin Gray was appointed manager. An appeal against the new club not being treated as a continuation of the old club was rejected, confirming that the club was to be treated as a new club and would not be able to play under the name Darlington F.C.

He scored his first goal for the club three weeks later, against Coventry City in the League Cup, and scored his first Premier League goal on 27 February 2005 against Charlton Athletic. On 9 March 2005, Graham signed a new contract with Middlesbrough on a two-year deal, that would keep him until 2007. The following season, Graham was loaned to Derby County and Leeds United, but did not score a league goal for either club. Despite having played for Middlesbrough in both the Premier League and UEFA Cup, Graham was unable to secure a place in the starting lineup; his only league start for the club came in a 1\u20130 defeat to Fulham at the end of the 2005\u201306 season."]}, {"page": "Sean Gregan", "response": ["Gregan returned to Darlington on 4 June 2012 as a player-coach, as part of new manager Martin Gray's backroom staff.

However, the two left the club four days later without having taken charge of a match. With Atkinson also being a director of the Martin Gray Football Academy (MGFA), Football Association rules meant he was unable to hold the Darlington managerial position as the academy's owner was in charge at another club. Gregan turned down the offer of a six-month contract to take over as manager on his own, as he would have had to relinquish his own role the MGFA."]}, {"page": "Stuart Parnaby", "response": ["Parnaby joined Martin Gray's backroom staff at National League North club York City in July 2018 as strength and conditioning coach.
