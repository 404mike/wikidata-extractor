Handy in 1980.  In the 1980s and 1990s, full CI programs were adapted to provide arbitrary-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory wave functions, and in the 2000s they have been adapted to provide coupled cluster wave functions to arbitrary orders, greatly simplifying the task of programming these complex methods."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Handy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas C.
