Colin Murray Parkes in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth in the first six months following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of suicide in teens following the death of a parent. Bereavement also increases the risk of heart attack."]}, {"page": "Parkes", "response": ["* Colin Murray Parkes (born 1928), British psychiatrist "]}, {"page": "Cruse Bereavement Care", "response": ["*Life President: Colin Murray Parkes, OBE"]}, {"page": "1996 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Colin Murray Parkes, President, Cruse Bereavement Care.
