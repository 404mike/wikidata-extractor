In the opinion of one German church historian, contemporaneous with Campbell, his theology was a highpoint of British theology during the nineteenth century. James B. Torrance ranked him highly on the doctrine of the atonement, placing Campbell alongside Athanasius of Alexandria and Anselm of Canterbury. Campbell took his cue from his close reading of the early Church Fathers, the historic Reformed confessions and catechisms, John Calvin, Martin Luther's commentary on Galatians, and Jonathan Edwards' works.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1800", "response": ["* May 4 \u2013 John McLeod Campbell, Scottish churchman (d. 1872)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Erskine (theologian)", "response": ["Thomas Erskine of Linlathen (13 October 178820 March 1870) was a Scottish advocate and lay theologian in the early part of the 19th century.

They longed for renewed spiritual power, as had been visible in the first century after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the young church. This movement was by no means restricted to the British Isles, with similar investigations and prayers being offered in France, Germany and elsewhere.

He accepted the invitation, without committing himself to Irving's doctrinal views. He spent the winter months in preaching and teaching among the poor of Westminster.
