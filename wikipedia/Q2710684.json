The stone was five foot high and consisted of five granite blocks, each with a letter of the respective Celtic nation etched into it in their own language (i.e. - \"E\" for Ireland, \"A\" for Scotland, \"C\" for Wales).Due to the all-but-extinction of the Cornish language, the movement of Cornish nationalism would not be included within the Pan-Celtic Congress until 1904, after Henry Jenner and L.
