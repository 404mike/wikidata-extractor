His repressive politics as well as the crisis in economy and high inflation fueled social conflict and far-left guerrilla activity; the latter of which manifested in the form of the Tupamaros.

When more than 100 Tupamaros escaped from jail, on September 9, 1971, Pacheco ordered the army to suppress all guerrilla activities.
