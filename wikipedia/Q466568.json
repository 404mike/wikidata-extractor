These schemes work by determining that the ball is more likely to fall at certain numbers. If effective, they raise the return of the game above 100%, defeating the betting system problem."]}, {"page": "Sampling (statistics)", "response": ["In other cases, the examined 'population' may be even less tangible. For example, Joseph Jagger studied the behaviour of roulette wheels at a casino in Monte Carlo, and used this to identify a biased wheel. In this case, the 'population' Jagger wanted to investigate was the overall behaviour of the wheel (i.e. the probability distribution of its results over infinitely many trials), while his 'sample' was formed from observed results from that wheel. Similar considerations arise when taking repeated measurements of some physical characteristic such as the electrical conductivity of copper."]}, {"page": "Shelf, West Yorkshire", "response": ["Joseph Jagger, a man reputed to have broken the bank at Monte Carlo was born at Shelf although, contrary to popular belief, he did not inspire the song \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo.\" Lucius Smith the first Bishop of Knaresborough was born at the Vicarage at Shelf in 1860. Kathleen Hale, author of the series of children's books about Orlando the Marmalade Cat also lived at the vicarage from 1903 to 1905, and developed her interest in plants, flowers and drawing there.

Technically, the bank in this sense was the money kept on the table by the croupier. According to an article in The Times in the late 19th century, it was thus possible to \"break the bank\" several times. The 1892 song \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\", made famous by Charles Coborn, was probably inspired by the exploits of Charles Wells, who \"broke the bank\" on many occasions on the first two of his three trips."]}, {"page": "Men who broke the bank at Monte Carlo", "response": ["== Joseph Jagger ==", "Joseph Jagger was a Bradford textile engineer who looked for and found imperfections in the balance of a wheel which he exploited to win a fortune and break the bank.
