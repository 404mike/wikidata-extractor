However, little attempt was made at realism. For example, Bayldon did not disguise the parquet flooring (\"it stops the set from literally representing [...] it reminds us we are in a modern television studio\"Quoted in Graham Holderness, \"Radical potentiality and institutional closure: Shakespeare in film and television\", in Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield (eds.), Political Shakespeare: Essays in Cultural Materialism, 2nd edition (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1984), 222), and in all four productions, the title of the play is displayed within the set itself (on banners in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI (where it is visible throughout the entire first scene), on a shroud in 3 Henry VI, and written on a chalkboard by Richard himself in Richard III).

The BBC Shakespeare Plays: Making the Televised Canon (Carolina: North Carolina Press, 1991), 28 and Ronald Knowles writes \"a major aspect of the set was the subliminal suggestion of childlike anarchy, role-playing, rivalry, game and vandalism, as if all culture were precariously balanced on the shaky foundations of atavistic aggression and power-mad possession.\"Ronald Knowles (ed.) King Henry VI, Part 2 (London: Arden, 1999), 22. See also Burns (2000: 306) Another element of verfremdungseffekt in this production is seen when Gloucester and Winchester encounter one another at the Tower, both are on horseback, but the horses they ride are hobby-horses, which the actors (David Burke and Frank Middlemass respectively) cause to pivot and prance as they speak. The ridiculousness of this situation works to \"effectively undercut their characters' dignity and status.\"Kingsley-Smith (2005: lxvii) The \"anti-illusionist\" set was also used as a means of political commentary; as the four plays progressed, the set decayed and became more and more dilapidated as social order became more fractious.Roger Warren, (ed.) Henry VI, Part Two (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 15 In the same vein, the costumes become more and more monotone as the four plays move on.
