Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel Wide Sargasso Sea. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in Jane Eyre. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable WH Smith Literary Award in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr. Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in Jane Eyre. Diana Athill of Andr\u00e9 Deutsch gambled on publishing Wide Sargasso Sea. She and the writer Francis Wyndham helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, Quartet, Penguin: 2000,  There have been film, operatic and radio adaptations of the book.Brian Kellow,\"On the Beat: A novel that sings: Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea\", Opera News, December 2012 \u2014 Vol. 77, No. 6.\"Jean Rhys \u2013 Wide Sargasso Sea\", RadioListings.\"Jean Rhys \u2013 Wide Sargasso Sea\", BBC Radio 4 Extra.

Almost all of them are illustrations of religious subjects, and I have been an atheist almost since the day I was confirmed in the Christian faith by the Bishop of Norwich in 1931. To describe the atheism first: it originated in a certainty that I was going to start breaking the rules as laid down by the god I'd been taught about, followed by a suspicion that if his rules were so easy to break he couldn't be all that he was cracked up to be. Then came its firmer base: the observation that many of the most hideous things done to each other by human beings have been done in his name. It can be argued that this is our fault, not God's. But the god we Europeans are supposed to believe in a) created us as well as everything else that is; b) is omnipotent; c) is Love.
