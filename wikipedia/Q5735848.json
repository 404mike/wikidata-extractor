From Marlboro' Wood to the north side of Mametz Wood, the 7th Division (Major-General Herbert Watts) and 21st Division (Major-General David Campbell) of XV Corps, faced no man's land which was  wide south of Bazentin le Grand Wood, Bazentin le Petit Wood, village and the cemetery  east. The advance would be uphill except beyond Mametz Wood, where the ground was flat. The 18th (Eastern) Division (Major-General Ivor Maxse) was to set up a defensive flank on the east face of Tr\u00f4nes Wood, between the 9th (Scottish) Division and the French 153rd Division, which would support the 18th (Eastern) Division with artillery if necessary. On the left flank, the 1st Division was to form another defensive flank in the Pearl Alley communication trench and capture Contalmaison Villa, to link with the 21st Division at Bazentin le Petit Wood.

Farr wrote that \"there is evidence that\u00a0... Philipps\u00a0... balked at sending waves of [his] men unprotected against machine guns\" and Travers wrote that Philipps had shown moral courage in cancelling unprepared attacks and for giving his troops \"instructions not to press the attack if machine-gun fire was met\". Horne had intended to replace Philipps with Major-General Charles Blackader but was overruled by Haig who ordered that Herbert Watts, commander of the 7th Division, was to take temporary command.
