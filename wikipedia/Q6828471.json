He was educated at King's College London.\nHe was one of the first producers to work in the field of drama for the BBC, producing and directing several plays for the fledgling BBC Television Service in the 1930s, before it was placed on hiatus for the duration of the Second World War in 1939. He also worked occasionally outside of drama, producing episodes of the magazine programme Picture Page during 1938. After the resumption of the service in 1946, Barry returned, and quickly became one of the senior drama producers.\nIn 1952, he succeeded Val Gielgud to become the Head of Drama at BBC Television, a position he was to occupy for the next decade. He was responsible for commissioning several important productions, including the Quatermass science-fiction serials, and in 1954 a famous adaptation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. This latter production caused much controversy due to its supposed horrific scenes and subversive content, and Barry appeared on the current affairs programme Panorama the day after broadcast to defend the production, and three days later introduced the second performance live to camera himself.\nBarry retired from his position of Head of Drama in 1961, being replaced the following year by his friend Sydney Newman, who went on to oversee great changes in the department. After a brief and unsuccessful spell in charge of RT\u00c9's new television service in Ireland, he returned for a time to front-line producing work, overseeing an epic series adaptations of William Shakespeare's The Wars of the Roses sequence of plays, before he retired altogether from television work.\nThe memoirs of his time in television, From the Palace to the Grove, were published by the Royal Television Society in 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wind in the Willows", "response": ["* Toad of Toad Hall, the first live action telecast of the novel.

However, it was the newness and innovation which Newman encouraged in his drama output that is most significant: his concentration on the potential of television as television, for a mass not a middlebrow audience.\" The academic Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh has criticised some of the eulogistic views of Newman's time at the BBC, writing that: \"When archive and press material emanating from the 1964\u201365 period is examined, an interesting gap appears between what Newman seemed likely to accomplish and what he finally did accomplish\u00a0... Also relevant to the mythology that has sprung up around Newman is the fact that his favoured dramatic material was interpreted by some as being rather less radical than it seemed.\""]}, {"page": "Donald Wilson (writer and producer)", "response": ["His initial career was in the film industry, including working for MGM at Elstree Studios, where he was Assistant Director of such films as Jericho (1937) and Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939).

In 1951 he was recruited as one of the first staff writers to be employed by BBC Television; before he started working for the station, Kneale had never seen any television. Kneale was initially a general-purpose writer, working on adaptations of books and stage plays and even writing material for light entertainment and children's programmes. The following year, Michael Barry became the Head of Drama at BBC Television, and spent his entire first year's script budget of \u00a3250 to hire Kneale as a full-time writer for the drama department. Kneale's first credited role in adult television drama was providing \"additional dialogue\" for the play Arrow to the Heart, broadcast on 20 July 1952.

The BBC's Head of Television Drama, Michael Barry, had committed most of his original script budget for the year to employing Kneale. An interest in science, particularly the idea of 'science going bad', led Kneale to write The Quatermass Experiment. The project originated when a gap formed in the BBC's schedules for a six-week serial to run on Saturday nights during the summer of 1953, and Kneale's idea was to fill it with \"a mystifying, rather than horrific\" storyline."]}, {"page": "Nineteen Eighty-Four (British TV programme)", "response": ["It was his work on Quatermass that had prompted the BBC's Head of Drama, Michael Barry, to ask Cartier to work on an adaptation of the novel, having shown his abilities with literary sources in a version of Wuthering Heights, again with Kneale handling the scripting. The BBC had purchased the rights to a television version of Nineteen Eighty-Four soon after its publication in 1949, with Kenneth Tynan having apparently originally been keen on adapting the work. The first version of the script, produced in late 1953, was written by Hugh Faulks, in consultation with Orwell's widow Sonia Brownell, but when Cartier joined in January 1954 he demanded that Kneale be allowed to handle the adaptation. This and other complexities of production meant that the April airdate \u2013 which would have been about 30 years before the novel was set \u2013 had to be postponed.", "Amidst objections the BBC went ahead with a complete live restaging on Thursday 16 December, although the decision went to the Board of Governors, which narrowly voted in favour of the second performance.

At his interview, Cartier told Barry that he thought his department's output was \"dreadful\",Jacobs, p. 132. and that television drama needed \"new scripts and a new approach\". In a 1990 interview about his career, he told BBC Two's The Late Show that the BBC drama department had \"needed me like water in the desert\". Barry shared many of Cartier's views on the need to improve television drama, and he hired him for the producer's job.", "Nineteen Eighty-Four had been a success, but it was also one of the most expensive television dramas ever made in the UK. Cartier often spent large amounts of money on his productions. Earlier in 1954, Michael Barry had heavily criticised him for the money and resources he had expended in an adaptation of Rebecca.
