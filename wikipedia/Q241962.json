During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about \"the Limey syndrome,\" claiming \"the attitude with a lot of people in Hollywood is that what they do in England is somehow better than what we do here.\" Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star, Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, \"It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite.\". In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that, despite four previous Academy Award nominations, \"it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona.\" Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film."]}]}}
