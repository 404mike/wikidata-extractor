Walkyier went on to form The Clan Destined. For many fans, Walkyier's lyrics and delivery style were one of the band's central  attractions, and there were fears that his departure spelled the end of the band. After replacing drummer Jay Graham (who left shortly after Walkyier) with drummer Arron Walton, and moving Kevin Ridley onto vocals, the group sprang into action to remedy these fears with 2002's No Daylights... Nor Heel Taps which featured studio recordings of \"Irish Pub versions\" of Skyclad classics by the new line-up, preceded by a single, 2001's \"Swords of a Thousand Men\". The single's title track, a cover tune (originally recorded by Tenpole Tudor), also appeared on Folk\u00e9mon as a bonus track, although in a different version. The single featured two recordings of the track, one of them with Ridley on vocals and one with Ridley sharing the microphone with Ten Pole Tudor's vocalist Edward Tudor-Pole.
