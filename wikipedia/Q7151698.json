The complete album was officially released via digital download on 3 June 2010. Produced and mixed by Tommy Henriksen and James Bourne, Bourne describes the album as \"100% electronic - and not a rock album\". The album had been previously released in two halves - with 'Side A' being released on 3 May, and 'Side B' being released on 1 June. The album's artwork was designed and painted by Paul Karslake. Bourne claims that the album will be released on CD at 'some point', but it will depend on 'when he has the cash'. Bourne has promoted the album by being the supporting act for Twenty Twenty during their 2010 Clubs & Pubs Tour."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society of Arts", "response": ["* Paul Karslake"]}, {"page": "Karslake", "response": ["* Paul Karslake (1958\u20132020), English artist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2020", "response": ["*Paul Karslake, 61, British painter, COVID-19.Jo Wood says brother Paul Karslake died of coronavirus"]}, {"page": "List of deaths due to COVID-19", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Paul Karslake"]}, {"page": "Karslake, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Karslake"]}]}}
