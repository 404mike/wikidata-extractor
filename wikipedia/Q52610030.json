The story also has an opening scene in which a little girl named Charlotte (a character from Grahame's The Golden Age) and a grown-up character find mysterious reptilian footprints in the snow and follow them, eventually finding a man who tells them the story of the Reluctant Dragon; two abridged versions (one by Robert D. San Souci and illustrated by John Segal and another abridged and illustrated by Inga Moore) both omit this scene. A New York Times review by  Emily Jenkins notes that this framework is somewhat long-winded and might cause some parents to worry about whether the story can keep children's attention. However, she finds the unabridged version preferable to both abridgments (although she says that \"Moore retains the pure joy of the author's descriptive passages\").", "The story served as the key element to the 1941 feature film with the same name, from Walt Disney Productions. The story has also been set to music as a children's operetta by John Rutter, with words by David Grant. In 1960, it was presented as a live-action episode starring John Raitt as St. George, on the television anthology The Shirley Temple Show. On 21 March 1968, Burr Tillstrom and Kukla, Fran and Ollie starred in a puppet version on NBC. In 1970\u20131971, it formed part of the anthology television program The Reluctant Dragon & Mr. Toad Show. In 1987, Cosgrove Hall Films adapted it for Thames ITV.  In 2004, Candlewick Press published the story as a picture book, with dozens of illustrations by Inga Moore. In 2008, Tony DiTerlizzi wrote Kenny & the Dragon as a tribute to Grahame's story, including naming the two heroes Kenneth and Grahame."]}, {"page": "2012 in literature", "response": ["*Inga Moore \u2013 Captain Cat"]}, {"page": "Captain Cat (Moore book)", "response": ["Captain Cat is a 2012 children's picture book by Inga Moore.
