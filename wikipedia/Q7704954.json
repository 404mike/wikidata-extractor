When Robbins was six years old, his mother began to suffer from breast cancer, which eventually caused her death three years later.  As Olga's health deteriorated, Robbins' father hired a domestic worker, nicknamed \"Auntie Annie\" by Robbins and his sister. \"Auntie Annie\" remained in the Robbins employ for two years until Olga died.", "The morning of March 6, 1970, while finishing up preparations to bomb the Non-Commissioned Officers Dance at Fort Dix, Robbins and two other New York Collective members, Diana Oughton and Ted Gold, blew themselves up in the explosion of a New York City townhouse. (Gold was not in the basement at the time; he had just returned from the Strand Bookstore). The explosion originated from the basement floor of the townhouse at 18 West 11th, in which Robbins and Oughton had been working.  Other members deduced that Robbins' inexperience in the art of bomb making led him to mistakenly cross wires and set off a premature detonation. The remains of the bodies found in the basement were almost unidentifiable; the police were able to identify the remains of Diana Oughton by a fragment of her thumb. Ted Gold's body was found outside, crushed under the townhouse's framework.  It was only with the issuance of the first official Weather Underground Organization (WUO) communiqu\u00e9, weeks after the explosion, that Terry Robbins was identified as the last victim.", "Shortly after the explosion, Weathermen leaders placed John Jacobs on indefinite leave from the WUO because he was the main advocate of Robbins' aggressive actions.Flanagan, Terry Robbins was convinced that extreme acts of destruction was the way for the organization to move into a revolution. He was seen as the main source of the Weathermen's aggressive tendencies; as friend Bill Ayers once said, \"his extremism was an impulse in all of us.\""]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Football Conference", "response": ["|=||align=left| Terry Robbins ||align=left| Welling United ||17||2||1||2||22"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Football Conference", "response": ["|=||align=left| Terry Robbins ||align=left| Welling United ||18||2||0||1||21"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Football Conference", "response": ["|=||align=left|  Terry Robbins ||align=left|  Welling United  ||29||0||1||0||30"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Football Conference", "response": ["|=||align=left| Terry Robbins ||align=left| Welling United ||19||1||2||1||23"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Football Conference", "response": ["|=||align=left| Terry Robbins ||align=left|  Welling United ||17||0||2||2||21"]}, {"page": "Robbins (name)", "response": ["* Terry Robbins (1947\u20131970), American activist", "* Terry Robbins (footballer) (born 1965), English footballer "]}, {"page": "List of Welling United F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Terry Robbins", "| Terry Robbins", "| Terry Robbins", "| Terry Robbins", "| Terry Robbins"]}]}}
