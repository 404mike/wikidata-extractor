After a period in several obscure bands, Samson formed his own eponymous outfit, Samson, in 1977, consisting of Chris Aylmer on bass guitar, and Clive Burr on drums. Burr left, and eventually joined Iron Maiden, and was replaced by Thunderstick, who wore a gimp mask on stage. In 1979, the line-up was expanded to a four-piece, with the addition of Bruce Dickinson on vocals (with the stage name \"Bruce\".\nThe band enjoyed a cult following in the new wave of British heavy metal, releasing the albums, Survivors, Head On and Shock Tactics, until 1981 when both Thunderstick and Dickinson left, the latter to join Iron Maiden.\nNicky Moore was recruited as a replacement, and Mel Gaynor then Pete Jupp took over drums, and this line-up released Before the Storm and Don't Get Mad - Get Even. These two albums sold in higher quantities than the first three, and the band toured more countries and played to bigger audiences than the Bruce/Thunderstick line-up, although the New Wave of British Heavy Metal was by now said to be a spent force.  The band formally split up in 1984.\nSamson spent the subsequent years in a variety of solo and group projects, including various temporary reformations of Samson, and had success as a record producer, and also as a blues player, spending a year in Chicago, Illinois, United States.\nDespite some listings crediting Samson for playing on the Ram Jam 1977 hit single, \"Black Betty\", he did not play on the record. Although, Stewart Cochrane (musician and close friend to Samson since their early band days of the late 1960s, their first band at 15 years old \"The Innocence\" and short time member of the band \"Samson\") was told by Samson in 1978 that he played on the demo of the hit record \"Black Betty\", and was paid a paltry \u00a320 for the session.  Samson was very peeved about the payment, as he insisted to Cochrane that it was his guitar playing from the demo recording used in the final \"Black Betty\" pressing, and that he was missing out on a large amount of royalty payments.  Cochrane can only confirm what Samson informed him of the alleged switch.\nSamson died of cancer on 9 August 2002 in Norwich, whilst recording a new Samson album with Nicky Moore.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 9", "response": ["*2002 \u2013 Paul Samson, English guitarist (b. 1953)"]}, {"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Thunderstick (Paul Samson)"]}, {"page": "Bruce Dickinson", "response": ["Dickinson played pubs with Shots on a regular basis to small audiences. One particular night, Dickinson suddenly stopped in the middle of a song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention. He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman. The next step in Dickinson's career was taken in a pub called the Prince of Wales in Gravesend, Kent, where Shots were playing regularly, when Barry Graham (\"Thunderstick\") and Paul Samson paid a visit. Impressed with his stage-act, they talked with Dickinson afterwards and invited him to be their new singer. Dickinson agreed to join their band, Samson, but only once he'd finished taking his History finals two weeks later. Until that point, he had been neglecting his University education. As a result, the University had tried to kick him out for failing his Second Year exams and not paying his accommodation fees, but he was saved because of his role as Entertainments Officer. After writing 6 months' worth of essays in the space of two weeks and some last minute cramming for his exams, Dickinson achieved a 2:2.", "After meeting Paul Samson and Barry Purkis at the Prince of Wales, and while still undertaking his final university exams, Dickinson joined Samson onstage at Bishop's Stortford to perform one of their songs, \"Rock Me Baby\", cementing his role as their new lead vocalist."]}, {"page": "Killers (Iron Maiden album)", "response": ["\"The Ides of March\" is nearly identical to \"Thunderburst\", by fellow British NWOBHM band Samson, who featured a pre-Maiden Bruce Dickinson on vocals; however, \"The Ides of March\" was written during the brief time in 1977 in which future Samson drummer Thunderstick was a member of Iron Maiden.

They are best known for their first three albums with future Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson, then known as \"Bruce Bruce\", and drummer Thunderstick (real name Barry Graham Purkis), who wore a leather mask and performed on stage in a metal cage. Drummer Clive Burr was also a member of the band, both before and after his tenure with Iron Maiden. Drummer Mel Gaynor had a successful music career being a member of Simple Minds for over 20 years. Dickinson's replacement on vocals, Nicky Moore, performed with Samson throughout the mid-1980s and again from the late 1990s onwards; he has also been a member of the bands Mammoth and Nicky Moore and the Blues Corporation. Samson were a part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.", "In 1976, Paul Samson replaced Bernie Torm\u00e9 in London-based band Scrapyard, joining bassist John McCoy and drummer Roger Hunt. The band name was changed to McCoy, and they built up a busy gigging schedule, whilst also independently playing various sessions. Eventually, McCoy left to join Atomic Rooster. His replacement was the band's sound engineer and a close friend of Paul Samson's, Chris Aylmer. Aylmer suggested a name change to Samson, and recommended a young drummer, Clive Burr, whom he had previously played with in the band Maya. Burr joined, and Samson was born, although for a time Paul Samson used bassist Bill Pickard and drummer Paul Gunn on odd gigs, when Aylmer and Burr were honouring previous commitments. Various other people were tried out to expand the line up: Paul Samson got in touch with an old bandmate, bass player Stewart Cochrane, and asked him to try out with the group as a four-piece, with the current bass player Chris Aylmer on second guitar alongside Paul. Only one gig was played in this incarnation, at The Nag's Head pub in Rochester, Kent on 11 March 1978, where it was decided that Samson and Aylmer's playing styles were not compatible, so they went back to being a three-piece. Cochrane later joined the avant-garde jazz-rock band Spanish Fly; and later continued his career as a band-leader for Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises. Cochrane performed and recorded with members of bands The Animals, Nashville Teens and Steve Hackett Band.  Talking to Cochrane in 2017 he allegedly said \u201cNot getting the Samson gig was the best thing to happen to him as the band\u2019s lifestyle choices and the music wasn\u2019t his cup-of-tea anyway\u201d.  It appears that Cochrane and Samson had a disagreement about Samson wanting Cochrane to dress up in some weird black leather military style uniform on stage, but they fell out mainly over Cochrane pointing out that the Samson logo on the Telephone single sleeve looked too much like the Nazi SS runes.  Their friendship since their teen band days finished there and then.  Cochrane moved to California in the early 1990\u2019s, retired from performing music due to arthritis and is currently living in Las Vegas Nevada.", "In October 1978, lead vocalist Mark Newman joined, but after about six shows, Paul Samson resumed lead vocals and they reverted to a three-piece line-up.", "At the end of 1978, Burr left. They auditioned over 60 drummers, and eventually decided on Barry Purkis. The band were offered a recording contract, but Aylmer would not commit, so Paul Samson and Purkis decided that, as John McCoy was producing and had co-written much of the material, they would ask him to play bass on the album. The album was recorded for release on Lazer records, and given the title Survivors. In late 1979, Bruce Dickinson joined as lead vocalist under the name 'Bruce Bruce'.", "Following Dickinson's departure, former Hackensack and Tiger vocalist Nicky Moore was recruited to front the band who had also signed a new recording contract with Polydor. Samson's first release with Moore was the \"Losing My Grip\" EP in 1982. The title track as well as \"Pyramid to the Stars\" had originally been cut with Dickinson. Those versions would remain unreleased until they surfaced on the Shock Tactics CD re-release in 2001. Samson issued two albums with Moore, 1982's Before the Storm and 1984 Don't Get Mad, Get Even before the group disbanded with Paul Samson carrying on solo. Samson reformed in 1987 and performed until 1991, through various line-up changes. The album Refugee was launched in 1990.", "In the early 1990s, Paul Samson asked New York singer/songwriter Rik Anthony to write lyrics and vocal melodies for Samson's \"reunion\" project with Thunderstick and Chris Aylmer. As a collaboration, Anthony wrote and recorded the lyrics and vocal melodies for eight songs while in New York, and in London re-recorded five demos at Picnic Studios. With limited time and budget, the band could only record five demo songs and the project was never completed. The Picnic demos were never picked up by Samson's record company, and sat idle for almost nine years. Anthony, Paul Samson, Gerry Sherwin and Tony Tuohy played some shows in Germany and the Netherlands under the name Paul Samson's Rogues, and as Samson whilst opening for Girlschool. After the dates in Europe, Anthony returned to New York. Samson had a new line-up in 1993 and recorded the album Samson.", "In 1999, Paul Samson released a CD containing five of the compositions from the Picnic Demos, entitled Past Present & Future.
