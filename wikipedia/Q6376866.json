She was born at the Old Forge, Lissandra, Crossmahon, Co.Cork, Ireland in 1885. Educated at the Royal University of Ireland and Cambridge, before entering politics she was a member of Cumann na mBan. In 1905 she married Michael O'Callaghan, who later became Mayor of Limerick and an IRA officer. He was killed in front of her by British forces in their home in 1921.She was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) at the 1921 elections for the Limerick City\u2013Limerick East constituency. She voted against the Anglo-Irish Treaty and sided with \u00c9amon de Valera. She was re-elected at the 1922 general election, this time as an Anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TD. In accordance with Sinn F\u00e9in abstentionist policy of the time, she did not take her seat in the 3rd D\u00e1il. She lost her seat at the 1923 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Nathan", "response": ["An article published in the New Statesman by Richard Bennett in 1961 stated that two former British Army officers who had served in the Auxiliaries had anonymously identified Nathan as the killer of the two mayors.

Brigadier-General Frank Percy Crozier, a former commandant of the Auxiliaries, in his book Ireland for Ever, stated that he agreed with Kathleen O'Callaghan (wife of one of the men killed, Michael O'Callaghan) that the mayors were \"murdered by police, acting under orders, as part of a plan to 'do away with' Sinn Fein leaders, and put the blame on Sinn Fein.\"Shooting in Limerick; Auxiliaries.com, 11 November 2016"]}, {"page": "Jan O'Sullivan", "response": ["O'Sullivan was unsuccessful again at the 1997 general election, but after Kemmy's death in September 1997, she was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the by-election in March 1998.
