As in most other burgage boroughs, the ownership of the burgages had early become concentrated in the hands of a single family, who in effect had a free hand to nominate both MPs.

He did not appear until the York August meeting where he had two engagements, the first in a four-mile Produce Sweepstakes for four-year-old colts and fillies. The betting suggested that he was his owner's second string, as the favourite was Henry Peirse's grey filly by Orville out of Ebor's half-sister Lisette. The filly's chance ended when she fell at the start, and Ebor won the race from Donna Rodriguez, the only other runner. Three days later, Ebor started at odds of 1/3 for a two-mile Sweepstakes at the same course, and won from Lord Fitzwilliam's colt Anselmo. Ebor returned to Doncaster in September for his only other appearance of the season. His owner was able to claim the prize in a four-mile sweepstakes without having to race his colt, as the other four entries were withdrawn, allowing Ebor to walk over."]}, {"page": "John Bacon Sawrey Morritt", "response": ["Born about 1772, he was son and heir of John Sawrey Morritt, who died at Rokeby Park in Yorkshire on 3 August 1791, by his wife Anne (died 1809), daughter of Henry Peirse of Bedale., M.P. for Northallerton.
