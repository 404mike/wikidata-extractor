As an extra precaution against touts (scalpers), purchasers had to pre-register, including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket. Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions, though without the flooding of 2005, in part due to the new \u00a3750,000 flood defences. However this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998.

The record was originally conceived as a ten-song concept album using D-A-D-D-A-D guitar tuning, but the band chose to abandon this idea during recording as they didn't want to constrain themselves. The group did attempt to create a \"more coherent\" album than their past efforts by choosing songs which worked well together. Phantom Power was recorded at the band's own studio, AV Happenings, in Cardiff with the Super Furries producing and engineering themselves for the first time. The album features a range of musical styles, from country rock to techno, although many of the tracks are based around the acoustic guitar. According to chief songwriter and vocalist Gruff Rhys, the album's lyrics deal with \"broken relationships and war\".", "Phantom Power was originally conceived as a ten-song cycle in the \"unconventional\" D-A-D-D-A-D guitar tuning. Singer Gruff Rhys wrote many of the songs on the album in this tuning and in the key of D major during the space of a few days. These tracks, which included the \"Father Father\" instrumentals, \"Golden Retriever\", \"Hello Sunshine\", \"Valet Parking\" and \"Out of Control\", were then demoed at the house of regular producer Gorwel Owen with overdubs added at the band's own office-block based studio, AV Happenings, in Cardiff.", "The album showcases an eclectic range of sounds from the country rock of \"Sex, War & Robots\", featuring pedal steel guitar, to the heavy metal and punk of \"Out of Control\" and the glam rock of first single \"Golden Retriever\". \"Slow Life\", a track which singer Gruff Rhys has described as the \"most sonically impressive\" song on Phantom Power, features techno influences and is based on a piece of electronic music written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran several years earlier. Ciaran encouraged the band to jam on top of his original track to produce a fusion of techno and guitar-pop. \"The Undefeated\" is inspired by ska and reggae music, although the group removed a \"cheesy white reggae\" section from the song because it sounded \"fucking horrible\" and actively tried not to make it sound too much like a ska or reggae track as they felt they \"couldn't pull it off\". Many tracks feature close vocal harmonies, with all the band apart from Pryce contributing. These harmonies give the album a California / West Coast of America feel, with comparisons being drawn to the work of The Beach Boys, particularly on the song \"Venus and Serena\".", "Singer and chief lyric writer Gruff Rhys has claimed that Phantom Power is about \"broken relationships and war\" with \"a positive outlook to the future\". As \"BBC News 24 addicts\" Rhys and the band absorbed \"fucked up war images\" from the Iraq War during the making of the album which affected the way songs were written: \"We seem to be living in such a heavy time. We're just absorbing all the words thrown at us from the TV and regurgitating them back.\" Frustration with the George Bush administration and its foreign policy influenced the record with Rhys claiming that he feels qualified to address the subject as United States foreign policy \"effectively decides what the foreign policy is in the UK\".", "However, Rhys has been keen to point out that the record is not a forcefully political one, claiming that most of the band's songs are \"fragments of daily life; occasionally politics are a part of that. Super Furry Animals is about exploration, not political campaigning\". \"Valet Parking\", for example, is a song about \"the glories of pan-European travel\", documenting a road trip from Cardiff to Vilnius, \"Golden Retriever\" is about \"the relationship between [Gruff Rhys's] girlfriend's two dogs - a male and a female\" and \"The Undefeated\", inspired by a poor run of results for the Welsh football team, is about \"underdogs and overdogs\".", "According to singer Gruff Rhys, the concept behind the DVD was based on the success of platform games: the listener can play the album as if it were a game and spend \"months ... instead of weeks\" exploring the content. Unlike the DVD version of previous album Rings Around the World, which featured videos for every track, the songs on the DVD are accompanied by slowly moving animations. Rhys has stated that the Super Furry Animals wanted to use \"really bland images\" as viewers began to place too much emphasis on the videos on Rings Around the World and the band wanted them to concentrate on the music.", "Phantom Power received generally positive reviews from critics with a score of 87 on Metacritic, denoting \"universal acclaim\". Drowned in Sound described the album as \"another fine, esoteric wonder of an LP\", while the NME claimed it is the group's \"most focussed, energetic pop record since Radiator\" and went on to state that \"for a band to be hitting such form six albums into a steady career is astonishing\". Q called it \"the band's best work to date, as accessible as it is inventive\"; The Times agreed, calling Phantom Power \"the Furries\u2019 most satisfying album to date ... one to cherish.\" Several critics commented on the \"summery pop\" nature of the record with Tiny Mix Tapes likening the album to \"the sun shining through following a large and brooding thunderstorm\" and The Times calling it \"mellow summer listening\" despite the \"grim view of the world\" expressed in Gruff Rhys's lyrics.

Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a \"laid back and sort of wiped clean\" record with Rings.... In a 2008 interview with Uncut Rhys described the album as \"a very ambitious project\" stating that \"We were trying to make a blockbuster album that was going to be like The Eagles ... We were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting.\" Rings... was originally going to be called Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It and released as a double album containing 75\u201390 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was \"into the excess of it, that was the whole point\". The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.", "Rings Around the World is \"very cinematic\" and falls somewhere between the Super Furry Animals' 1999 album, the \"instantaneous, easy to grasp, and almost disposable\" Guerrilla, and its \"exact opposite\", 2000's Mwng. The band combined the technology they used for the former with the simplicity of the latter, which featured \"just the band playing in the studio\". Singer Gruff Rhys has described the album as the band's \"cosmic rock record\".", "Singer and chief lyric writer Gruff Rhys has given several explanations of the lyrical themes present on the album. He has claimed that the record is \"about Earth, and the pollution of space: it's about debris\" and that it was originally going to be a \"state of the planet concept album\" before the band decided against it. Rhys has also stated that the album is about the human condition, citing tracks such as \"Fragile Happiness\" and \"Receptacle For The Respectable\" as examples. Critics have referred to the album as \"thematically eccentric\" and lacking an \"overarching theme\" with The Independent claiming it leaps \"from religious fundamentalists to modern telecommunications and the old Hollywood star system with disorienting glee\".", "Ciaran has stated that the Super Furry Animals were \"very hands-on\" during the making of the DVD. Initially the band were mainly concerned with the sound quality, describing the presentation of the album's tracks in surround sound as \"radical, like the change from mono to stereo\". The group directed the surround sound mix themselves, instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers: \"We want that one bit of sound to travel from the centre, over our heads and finish on my right shoulder ... Let's have the main vocal in the middle, then each harmony in its own speaker.\" They soon became equally as interested in the remixes, visuals and interactive elements however. Ciaran has described this process as \"not always a nice position to be in\" when, for example, they had to reject music videos they weren't happy with. The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album Guerrilla themselves. According to singer Gruff Rhys the band \"tended to go for illustrators who could [make videos] cheaply using Flash ... and artists who like to work\". The directors were asked to make the visuals as \"extreme as possible\" in an effort to avoid making videos that looked like just \"another pop promo ... like MTV\" and, according to Ciaran, had to \"work even harder at creating something interesting\" due to the limited budget available. Many of those who made videos for the DVD release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a \"really fresh ... kind of scruffy\" end product. According to Rhys the band made separate music videos for Rings Around the World's three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as \"pure art\" whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for the songs. Rhys has stated that the Super Furry Animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on the videos on Rings Around the World rather than concentrating on the music, as a result of which the band used \"really bland images\" on the DVD release of their next album Phantom Power.", "Although he enjoyed having so much control over the project Ciaran has claimed that it \"sometimes felt like it would never end\" and he was glad to get back to \"the music side of things\" upon the DVD's completion. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that he found being involved with all aspects of the DVD release \"really exciting\" and particularly enjoyed working with \"so many people\".", "Rings Around the World received praise from critics with a score of 86 on Metacritic, denoting \"universal acclaim\". Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork stated that the album's combination of \"paisley, sun-heated, and layered\" music with Gruff Rhys's \"satirical and heartfelt lyrics\" makes it \"timeless\" and the band's best record. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters called the record \"near-perfect\" and wrote that \"we should be thankful there are bands out there willing to throw everything they've got into a record just to see what happens\". Uncut praised its \"accessible and adventurous\" nature, while The Independent opined that Rings Around the World \"represents a quantum jump beyond the Furries' previous work\" and described it as \"one of the year's most engrossing \u2013 and, crucially, most entertaining \u2013 albums\". Mojo stated that Rings Around the World was the band's \"first truly flawless album\" and later named it the best album of 2001. Tiny Mix Tapes called Rings Around the World \"one of the, if not the, best releases of 2002\", describing it as a \"mixture of sugar pop of yesteryear and modern Britpop\" resulting in a \"near perfect\" album.

Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that his lyrics are upbeat and disposable. Critical reception was generally positive with the record appearing in the \"Best album of 1999\" lists issued by several magazines. It was subsequently ranked at number 311 on the NME's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The band were disappointed with the relative lack of success of the album's singles and went on \"pop strike\" as a result, issuing the 'lo-fi', all-Welsh language Mwng as the follow-up to Guerrilla in May 2000.", "Guerrilla was deliberately conceived as a commercial-sounding 'pop' album; a \"jukebox sort of album, where you listen to it and every song is different,\" according to singer Gruff Rhys. Rhys has said that the band felt they were waging a \"sonic war\" against average music and \"the mainstream\" with the record.", "During recording, the band used a sampler for the first time and hired many different musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing \"the music to dictate itself\". The song \"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\" was written around the ringtone of a mobile phone with the rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. \"Some Things Come from Nothing\" came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was \"written and recorded simultaneously\" by the group. \"The Sound of Life Today\" is a 22-second sample of \"Some Things Come From Nothing\" played backwards \u2013 an accident that occurred when mixing engineer Chris Shaw rewound the mix and forgot to mute the tape machine . According to Rhys the band gave the track a \"really pompous title\" so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead get just a \"collection of noises\". \"Do or Die\", \"Fire in My Heart\" and \"Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy\" were written by Rhys while \"The Door to This House Remains Open\" developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for \"Northern Lites\" was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments \"lying around\" Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.", "Guerrilla features an eclectic mix of musical styles and has been described by Pitchfork as a combination of the group's techno roots and their more recent \"sunny guitar-pop\". The NME featured an interview with the Super Furry Animals, several weeks before the release of the album in the United Kingdom, as the lead article in an issue which discussed the \"nu-psychedelia\" musical genre, which they saw Guerrilla as exemplifying. Gruff Rhys has stated, however, that he sees the album as a quite conventional pop album, and that he associates psychedelia with improvisation whereas Guerrilla was \"almost entirely preconceived\". The singer has also said that the album is not a radical departure for the group musically, although it is \"more groovy and uptempo [...] more textured and punchy\" than the band's previous releases, partly due to the mix which creates a \"more American sound\". Spin stated that the record combines \"prog, glam, techno, and garage\" and is the \"gleeful missing link in the psych-prog continuum\". Select stated that the album juxtaposes pop songs with \"rambling odities\" and is dominated by the \"electronic throbs and pulses\" of keyboard player Cian Ciaran at the expense of guitarist Huw Bunford. The magazine went on to say that Gruff Rhys's voice anchors the record and gives life to songs which otherwise might seem to be works-in-progress, citing \"Chewing Chewing Gum\" as an example.", "According to Gruff Rhys, Guerrillas lyrics are largely \"self-consciously disposable, happy\". \"The Door to This House Remains Open\" is about \"starting a new chapter of your life\". Rhys has said that his lyrics, which suggest that people should leave their doors open to others and that international borders should be open to allow immigration, are so optimistic that he is almost embarrassed by them. In contrast \"Some Things Come From Nothing\" features pessimistic lyrics inspired by the idea that \"nothing seems to have any substance any more\". \"The Teacher\" was written by Rhys from a teacher's perspective and was inspired by guitarist Huw Bunford, who was an art teacher before the Super Furry Animals became successful. Although Rhys has stated that \"Fire in My Heart\" features the most clich\u00e9d lyrics he has ever written, he has also said that he wrote it with complete sincerity. The track is \"soul advice\" and is about the many different people in our lives.", "The Super Furry Animals embarked on a brief, five-date, tour of the United Kingdom, in support of first single \"Northern Lites\", beginning at Tenby De Valance Pavilion on 27 April 1999 and ending at the Cambridge Corn Exchange on 2 May.
