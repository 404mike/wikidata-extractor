Starkey suggested that people should not \"go on about\" slavery because it had been abolished in 1833, and said: \"Slavery was not genocide, otherwise there wouldn't be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain would there? An awful lot of them survived...\" He had made the same point in a column eight days earlier except without the use of the word 'damn'. Starkey's comments were rebuffed by Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said they were racist and that they serve as \"a reminder of the appalling views that still exist\", and they were widely described as racist in the media. Historian David Olusoga, praised by Starkey in the same broadcast, described the comments as \"truly disgusting.
