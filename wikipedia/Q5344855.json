Conybeare asked, \"What special qualifications have entitled a foreigner to be promoted over the heads of some 30 British officers?\" First Lord of the Admiralty Lord George Hamilton said, \"Captain Stephenson, who commands the Dreadnought, applied for Prince Louis of Battenberg to fill the appointment. I may add that another officer who is about to command a large iron-clad in the Mediterranean has made a similar application.\" He added that 22 commanders junior to Battenberg held similar appointments, and that Battenberg was a naturalised British subject. Another Liberal MP, Edward Pickersgill, backed up by Conybeare and Irish nationalist Charles Tanner, questioned the propriety of Battenberg's appointment to the Navy in 1868, given Battenberg's failure to get the required medical certificate, and suggested that he only got in the Navy because of royal favour."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "Bethnal Green South West (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill", "| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London", "response": ["A meeting of the London Liberal and Radical Union was held on 15 October to consider the commission's report.

In September 1900 he was selected as Conservative and Unionist candidate to contest the parliamentary seat of Bethnal Green South West, held by the prominent Liberal MP, Edward Pickersgill. Ridley's pro war stance saw him unexpectedly take the seat from Pickersgill at the general election of that year. Six years later there was a swing to the Liberals and they regained the Bethnal Green seat. In 1907 the local Conservative association chose a different candidate to contest the constituency at the next general election, with Ridley being rejected due to his views on tariff reform. He was instead chosen to contest the Kent borough of Rochester. He was able to unseat the sitting Liberal MP when an election was held in January 1910, but was himself defeated when a further election was held in December of the same year. In the following year he indicated that he would not contest the seat again."]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "Edward Hare Pickersgill", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "Pickersgill", "response": ["*Edward Pickersgill (1850\u20131911), English politician"]}, {"page": "1911 Bethnal Green South West by-election", "response": ["Edward Pickersgill, the sitting Liberal MP for Bethnal Green South West, resigned from the House of Commons in July 1911; in order to take up a post as a stipendary magistrate."]}, {"page": "Hackney Central (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["| Edward Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "Henry William Austin", "response": ["Henry Fowler asked a question in parliament, backed up by Edward Pickersgill, about the legality of the flogging sentence, on 1 March 1889.
