Previous Lady Elizabeth's veterans to join include Nathan Field, John Rice, and (via Prince Charles's Men) Joseph Taylor. Swanston is reported to have played Othello and Richard III during his years with the company (which extended at least through 1642).", "In 1633, the company had difficulties with Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, over the content of their plays. On 19 October, Herbert forbad the performance of The Woman's Prize, Fletcher's sequel to Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, because of its \"foul and offensive\" content. The company acted the Fletcher/Beaumont play The Scornful Lady instead. On 21 October, Herbert addressed a letter to Edward Knight, the \"book-keeper\" or prompter of the company, on the subject of the \"oaths, profaneness, and public ribaldry\" in their plays. And on 24 October, John Lowin and Eliard Swanston apologised to Herbert for giving offence. (Joseph Taylor and Robert Benfield were reportedly present at the meeting, but were uninvolved in either the offence or the apology; apparently Swanston and Lowin were in the cast of The Woman's Prize but Benfield and Taylor were not.) After this incident, the King's Men had their old play texts re-examined by Herbert for new productions, something that was previously not required. This meant more fees paid to Herbert.", "On 7 April 1634, the King's Men played George Chapman's Bussy D'Ambois at Court. The title role was reportedly played by Eliard Swanston; Joseph Taylor, at this point in his career, was too \"grey\" for the role of a young firebrand.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 253\u20134. The company played the same play at Court again on 27 March 1638.", "In the early 1630s, William Heminges sold off the theatre shares he'd inherited from his father upon John Heminges's death (1630). He sold (clandestinely, perhaps) two shares in the Blackfriars and three in the Globe to King's Man John Shank, for \u00a3506. In response to the sale, three other King's Men, Eliard Swanston, Thomas Pollard, and Robert Benfield, appealed to the Lord Chamberlain (then Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke) for a chance to buy shares for themselves. Several documents in this matter, including back-and-forth statements from the three petitioners and from Cuthbert Burbage and John Shank, still exist; they contain abundant information on the company's business c. 1635.", "Clandestine and sporadic theatre activity occurred. 1647 was a year of relative official leniency, when theatrical performances were not uncommon. Ten actors signed the dedication in the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher folio as the King's Men; these were Robert Benfield, Theophilus Bird, Hugh Clark, Stephen Hammerton, John Lowin, Thomas Pollard, Richard Robinson, Joseph Taylor, Eliard Swanston, and William Allen. The first seven men on that list also signed a contract as sharers in the King's Men on 28 January 1648, showing that the company was re-activating, or attempting to re-activate, at that time.

The prelude to the 1641 edition also indicates that Nathan Field played Bussy; Field may have brought the play to the King's Men when he joined in 1616.

The warrant prohibited 'the acting of your play called The Tamer Tamed or The Taming of the Tamer, this afternoon, or any more till you have leave from me \u2013 and this is at your peril'. Five days later, on 24 October, John Lowin and Eliard Swanston, two of the leading actors in the company, came to Herbert's office to apologize personally for having given offense; their fellow actors Joseph Taylor and Robert Benfield were also present at the meeting, but apparently uninvolved in either the original offense or the apology. In regard to the same matter, Herbert addressed a 21 October letter to Edward Knight, the \"book-keeper\" or prompter of the King's Men, on the subject of \"oaths, profaneness, and public ribaldry\" in the company's plays.Halliday, p. 268. Herbert's reaction to the play, which may have been caused by accusations of leniency from his superiors, specifically the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, caused tension between the acting companies and the censor. Herbert's intervention in the performance that day resulted in a greater focus on the re-licensing of old plays that were being revived at the time."]}, {"page": "The Lover's Melancholy", "response": ["The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 24 November 1628.

The quarto bears a dedication from Ford to four friends at Gray's Inn, one of whom is a cousin, also named John Ford. This second John Ford contributed commendatory verse to a couple of the dramatist's plays, including The Lover's Melancholy. The first edition also supplies an unusually full cast list, specifying the 17 King's Men's actors who took part in the original production.They are listed in this order: John Lowin, Joseph Taylor, Robert Benfield, John Shank, Eliard Swanston, Anthony Smith, Richard Sharpe, Thomas Pollard, William Penn, Curtis Greville, George Vernon, Richard Baxter, John Thompson, John Honyman, James Horn, William Trigg, and Alexander Gough.

Pembroke ordered Shank and the Burbage family to sell shares to the three actors; but Shank and Cuthbert Burbage both protested the ruling. The dispute generated a back-and-forth documentation, sometimes called the \"sharers' papers,\" that has provided subsequent generations of scholars and researchers with important data on the theatre business of the age. Shank complained that he and the three actors could not reach acceptable terms for a sale, and that they prevented him from performing with the company.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 339.

When the troupe had acquired its two theatres, the Globe (1598\u201399) and the Blackfriars (1608), prominent members of the company-owned shares in the theatres, and so gained additional shares in their profits, beyond what they earned as actors. They were termed \"housekeepers\" of the theatres. Over the next generation, actors died and passed their shares to their heirs; their replacements, in the next generation of actors, were cut out of the housekeepers' income (though as sharers in the acting company, they received their own portions of the profits). In 1635, three prominent actors, Pollard, Eliard Swanston, and Robert Benfield, petitioned the Lord Chancellor, Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, to be allowed to purchase theatre shares from the present housekeepers; and Pembroke agreed."]}, {"page": "The Swisser", "response": ["|Eliard Swanston"]}, {"page": "The Deserving Favourite", "response": ["|Eliard Swanston"]}, {"page": "The Spanish Viceroy", "response": ["The outcome was unsurprising, given the way the system of control worked.
