At The Dell, Petrie provided extra competition for first team places and made his debut, replacing his former Sheffield Wednesday colleague Sam Taylor, away to Leeds United on 3 September 1927. For the duration of his time with the Saints, Petrie was in and out of the side, with his longest run of games being eight matches in September/October 1928, before Herbert Coates was signed in October. In two seasons, Petrie made 24 appearances, scoring some vital goals, before being released on a free transfer."]}, {"page": "Tom Brewis", "response": ["During the summer of 1932, the Saints' worsening financial position resulted in the sales of both Fraser (to Fulham) and Wilson (to West Ham United) leaving Brewis as the only recognised inside-right, with Herbert Coates being recalled at inside-left. Despite the sales in the summer, the Saints' side had a settled look in 1932\u201333, with ten players making 30 or more appearances. Brewis and Coates became established as the inside-forwards, with Ted Drake in the centre, and Dick Neal and Johnny Arnold on the wings. Brewis scored ten goals from 31 League appearances, including a hat-trick in a 4\u20131 victory over Manchester United on 3 September 1932. Described as \"not a tall man\", Brewis \"had the knack of hanging in the air to head improbable goals\"."]}, {"page": "Peter Dougall", "response": ["In September 1929, Dougall was signed by Southampton, with his transfer fee being met by the Saints Supporters Club. Described in the local press as \"in the Alex James class\", Dougall was able to combine skill with the ability to \"beat a man on a sixpence\", although he did have a tendency to over-elaborate. He made his debut for the Saints on 19 October 1929, when he replaced Herbert Coates in a 4\u20130 defeat at Stoke City. Coates returned for the next match and Dougall's appearances were initially limited until March, when he had a run of seven games. In the 1930\u201331 season, Dougall was again used as cover for Coates or Laurie Cumming, before taking over from Cumming in February 1931 for the remainder of the season."]}, {"page": "Arthur Wilson (English footballer)", "response": ["He was quickly spotted by scouts from Southampton and he joined the south coast club in August 1927. After spending two seasons in the reserves, where he showed \"admirable skill\", he made his first-team debut when he replaced the veteran Bert Shelley for a Second Division match away to Reading on 14 December 1929. Wilson retained his position at left-half for the remainder of the season and for the start of the 1930\u201331 season. After three matches, he lost his place to Bill Adams and briefly switched to inside left before being replaced by Herbert Coates.

In the next season, Ruddy played the first six matches at inside-left, before losing out to Coates.

Due to ongoing injury problems for his side's regular centre-forward Haines, in February 1929 Chadwick brought in former Royal Air Force aircraftsman Douglas Vernon to help with the end of season run-in. The final signings of the season were goalkeeper Bert Scriven from Totton and inside-left Ernie Warren from Third Division North side Lincoln City in March 1929.

Southampton also won the Hampshire Benevolent Cup two days later, beating Pompey at The Dell 3\u20132. Jimmy Easson opened the scoring for the visitors within five minutes, before an Arthur Bradford penalty made it 1\u20131 going into half-time.
