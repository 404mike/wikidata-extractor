In four years with the club he scored 77 goals in 174 league appearances and helped them to win the league title; his performances earned him a move to Port Vale in October 1976, where he turned semi-professional. He refused to become a full-time professional, and instead was sold on to Altrincham in July 1977. He maintained an average goal ratio of a goal every two games in his time at Moss Lane, helping the club to two Alliance Premier League titles and triumph in the Cheshire Senior Cup, FA Trophy and Conference League Cup competitions. He had a brief spell back in the Football League with Wigan Athletic in 1982\u201383, before he saw out his career at Altrincham, Barrow, and Runcorn.\nHe also won five caps as an England semi-pro international.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oswestry Town F.C.", "response": ["*John Rogers (1987\u2013?)"]}, {"page": "John Rogers", "response": ["John Rogers may refer to:", "* John Rogers (died 1565) (before 1507\u20131565), English MP for Dorset, 1545\u20131559", "* John Rogers II (died 1611/12), MP for Canterbury", "* John Rogers (1750\u20131832), British MP for West Looe, Penryn and Helston", "* Sir John Rogers, 1st Baronet (1649\u20131710), English MP for Plymouth 1698\u20131700", "* Sir John Rogers, 2nd Baronet (1676\u20131744), British MP for Plymouth 1713\u20131722", "* Sir John Rogers, 3rd Baronet (1708\u20131773), British MP for Plymouth 1739\u20131740", "* Sir John Rogers, 6th Baronet (1780\u20131847), British MP for Callington", "* John Rogers (Continental Congress) (1723\u20131789), delegate to Continental Congress", "* John Rogers (New York politician) (1813\u20131879), US Congressman from New York", "* John Rogers (Alabama politician) (born 1940), Alabama State Representative", "* John Rogers (Ohio politician), Ohio state representative", "* John Rogers (Cherokee chief), last elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation West", "* John Rogers (Australian politician) (1842\u20131908)", "* John Rogers (Irish lawyer) (born 1947), Attorney General of Ireland, 1984\u20131987", "* John Rogers (Bible editor and martyr) (c. 1500\u20131555), editor and translator of the Matthew Bible", "* John Rogers (died 1636), Puritan lecturer of Dedham, Essex", "* John Rogers (Fifth Monarchist) (1627\u2013?), minister and physician", "* John Rogers (priest) (1679\u20131729), English controversialist", "* John Rogers (divine) (1778\u20131856), clergyman and writer", "* John Rogers (Dean of Llandaff) (born 1934), Dean of Llandaff Cathedral in Wales", "* John Rogers (Archdeacon of Leicester) (1648\u20131715), Anglican priest in England", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1858) (1858\u20131935), Australian cricketer for Victoria", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1860) (1860\u2013?), English cricketer for Middlesex", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1910) (1910\u20131968), English first-class cricketer", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1943), Australian cricketer for New South Wales, see Chris Rogers", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1987), Australian cricketer for Tasmania, Western Australia", "* John Rogers (rugby union) (1867\u20131922), England international rugby union player", "* John Rogers (baseball) (1844\u20131910), owner of the Philadelphia Phillies", "* John Rogers, Irish footballer for Shelbourne FC, brother of Eamonn Rogers", "* John Rogers (footballer) (born 1950), English footballer", "* John Rogers (ice hockey) (born 1953), Canadian ice hockey player", "* John Rogers (ice hockey, born 1910) (1910\u2013?), British ice hockey player", "* John Rogers (rower) (1930\u20132016), Australian Olympic rower", "* John Rogers (American football center) (1910\u20131968), American football player", "* John Rogers (Harvard) (1630\u20131684), president of Harvard University", "* John Rogers (sculptor) (1829\u20131904), sculptor from Salem, Massachusetts", "* John Rogers (naturalist) (1807\u20131867), English barrister and gardener", "* John Rogers (RAF officer) (1928\u20132021), British air marshal", "* John Rogers (writer), screenwriter, comics writer, film producer", "* John Rogers (businessman) (?\u20132018), Canadian-born American businessman and executive", "* John Rogers (academic) (1651\u20131703), English academic", "* John Rogers (Albemarle County, Virginia) (died 1838), overseer of three plantations"]}, {"page": "Roy Sproson", "response": ["For the 1976\u201377 season he was forced to sell Terry Lees to Sparta Rotterdam for \u00a325,000 (representing a \u00a322,000 profit in the space of twelve months).

Then only one point was gained in the next six matches. To bolster the side in came Stoke City's veteran defender Eric Skeels, who was also returning from a spell in the USA. Mick Cullerton then severed a cartilage, which meant five months out of action for the star striker. To replace him Sproson signed Blackburn Rovers' Ken Beamish (\u00a312,000) and Wigan Athletic's John Rogers ('a small fee'). The club also made other clubs aware that they would listen to any offers for players, but there was little in the way of interest. In October, former England and Wolves defender Bobby Thomson was another player returning from the States. Signing with the Vale, he impressed so much that he was made club captain in his first week at Vale Park. A club record run of 42 away games without a clean sheet began on 18 December, and would last until 30 September 1978. The first of this run was a 1\u20131 draw with Rotherham United at Millmoor, after this match \"Millers\" boss Jimmy McGuigan stated that Vale showed 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Even though the defence struggled away from home, Beamish did not, as he scored his first ten goals for the club away from Burslem.

On the coaching front, Roy Chapman was replaced by Colin Harper.
