He was a leading star, becoming one of the highest paid actors in the early film industry. Many of the films he starred in did not survive to the present day. Duncan, who was Hollywood's first Scottish movie star, worked with the major studios of the day including the Selig Polyscope Company and Vitagraph.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1961", "response": ["* February 7 \u2013 William Duncan, American actor (b. 1879)"]}, {"page": "Inglewood Park Cemetery", "response": ["* William Duncan (1879\u20131961), actor"]}, {"page": "Tenderfoot", "response": ["* The Tenderfoot (1917 film), a 1917 American film starring and directed by William Duncan"]}, {"page": "Myrtle Gonzalez", "response": ["Gonzalez was best known for her role as Enid Maitland in Vitagraph's six-reel feature length drama The Chalice of Courage (1915) opposite William Duncan.

Aided by French-born writer and poet Hugh Antoine d'Arcy, who served as the studio's publicity manager, in 1910 Siegmund Lubin built a state of the art studio on the corner of Indiana Avenue and Twentieth Street in Philadelphia that became known as \"Lubinville.\" At the time, it was one of the most modern studios in the world, complete with a huge artificially lit stage, editing rooms, laboratories, and workshops. The facility allowed several film productions to be undertaken simultaneously. The Lubin Manufacturing Company expanded production beyond Philadelphia, with facilities at 750 Riverside Avenue in Jacksonville, Florida, Los Angeles, and then in Coronado, California. In 1912, Lubin purchased a  estate in Betzwood, in what was then rural countryside in the northwest outskirts of Philadelphia and converted the property into a studio and film lot. That same year, director and actor Romaine Fielding traveled out to Prescott, Arizona with cast and crew and set up offices at 712 Western Avenue and an outdoor stage for shooting interiors behind Mercy Hospital (now the site of Prescott College). He filmed approximately a dozen movies there before moving to Tucson, Arizona, where he directed another 60 or so silent short films. William Duncan and Selig Polyscope Company took over the Prescott facility."]}, {"page": "List of film serials", "response": ["| William Duncan", "| William Duncan, Carol Holloway", "| William Duncan and Laurence Trimble", "| William Duncan, Carol Holloway", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan, Edith Johnson, Joe Ryan", "| William Duncan and Clifford Smith", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan, Edith Johnson", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan, Edith Johnson", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan, Edith Johnson", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan, Edith Johnson", "| William Duncan", "| William Duncan, Edith Johnson"]}, {"page": "William Duncan", "response": ["William Duncan may refer to:", "*Sir William Duncan, 1st Baronet (died 1774), Scottish physician", "*William Duncan (actor) (1879\u20131961), Scottish-born actor and director of film serials", "*William Duncan (Australian cricketer) (1912\u20131943), Australian cricketer", "*William Duncan (New Zealand cricketer) (1933\u20132008), New Zealand cricketer", "*William Duncan (footballer) (1913\u20131975), Scottish association football player", "*William Duncan (missionary) (1832\u20131918), English-born Anglican missionary", "*William Duncan (philosopher) (1717\u20131760), Scottish natural philosopher and classicist", "*William Duncan Baxter (1868\u20131960), mayor of Cape Town, South Africa", "*William Duncan Connor (1864\u20131944), lieutenant governor of Wisconsin", "*William Duncan Herridge (1888\u20131961), Canadian politician", "*William Duncan MacMillan (1871\u20131948), American mathematician and astronomer"]}, {"page": "List of film serials by studio", "response": ["|William Duncan", "|William Duncan", "|William Duncan", "|William Duncan", "|William Duncan and Laurence Trimble", "|William Duncan", "|William Duncan and Clifford Smith", "|William Duncan", "|William Duncan", "|William Duncan"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1922", "response": ["|The Fighting Guide || William Duncan || William Duncan, Edith Johnson || Action || Vitagraph", "| The Silent Vow || William Duncan || Edith Johnson, Dorothy Dwan || Action || Vitagraph", "| When Danger Smiles || William Duncan || Edith Johnson, James Farley || Western || Vitagraph"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1923", "response": ["| Playing It Wild || William Duncan || Edith Johnson, Edmund Cobb || Western || Vitagraph"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1917", "response": ["| Dead Shot Baker || William Duncan || Carol Holloway, Otto Lederer || Western || Vitagraph", "| The Tenderfoot || William Duncan || Carol Holloway, Walter Rodgers || Western || Vitagraph"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1916", "response": ["| God's Country and the Woman || Rollin S.
