The latter band eventually morphed into Tubeway Army with his uncle Jess Lidyard on drums and Gardiner on bass and were signed to Beggars Banquet Records.

However, Numan's career had begun to experience a gradual decline, and he was eclipsed commercially by former support act Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, as well as by the Human League, Duran Duran, and Depeche Mode.
