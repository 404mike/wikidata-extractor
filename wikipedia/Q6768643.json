Bartram and Hope made the most appearances; both played every one of the team's 52 competitive matches.  As they were in the starting line-up for every game and not substituted at any point, both played every minute of competitive football during the team's season.  Five players made only one appearance each.  Three of them were teenagers from the club's youth team, who were selected to make their debuts for the first team once Gillingham had secured their place in the First Division for another season.  Of these, Andrew Crofts would go on to play nearly 200 times for the Gillingham first team and later play in the Premier League and for the Welsh national team, but the single appearances made by Mark Lovell and Michael Phillips would prove to be the entirety of the two players' professional careers."]}, {"page": "Lovell (surname)", "response": ["*Mark Lovell (1960\u20132003), British rally driver", "*Mark Lovell (footballer) (born 1983), English footballer "]}]}}
