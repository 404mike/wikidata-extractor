However the IFA objected and Baird subsequently received a telegram from the English FA ordering him not to accept the offer on the grounds he was not born in the Irish Free State. Baird was bitterly disappointed at missing the chance of an international debut and was keen to play for financial reasons as much as anything. He was neutral about the dispute and was willing to play for either team. However facing suspension from the English FA, he eventually declined the FAI offer."]}, {"page": "Jackie Brown (footballer)", "response": ["In May 1937 the FAI organised a European tour with a squad that included Brown and two other Northerners, Davy Jordan and John Feenan. Brown made his debut for the FAI XI on 17 May in a 1\u20130 win against Switzerland. A week later, on 23 May, he scored the second goal as the FAI XI defeated France 2\u20130. This would prove to be his last appearance for the FAI XI. However, in May 1938, for another European tour, the FAI once again called up Brown, together with two other Northerners, Harry Baird and Walter McMillen. However this time the IFA objected and all three players received telegrams from the English FA ordering them not to accept the offer on the grounds they were not born in the Irish Free State."]}, {"page": "1933\u201334 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Walter McMillen"]}, {"page": "1934\u201335 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Walter McMillen"]}, {"page": "McMillen", "response": ["*Walter McMillen (1913\u20131987), Northern Irish footballer"]}]}}
