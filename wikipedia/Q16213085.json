Thomas took to the physicality of the sport and was part of the Great Britain squad who attempted to qualify for the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Utah. The team failed to reach the Utah games but Thomas' desire to attend a Winter Paralympics, saw him part of the team who four years later qualified for the 2006 Games in Turin. The British squad was placed into Group A, along with Italy and the two eventual finalists Canada and Norway. The British squad lost heavily to both Canada (9\u20130) and Norway (6\u20130), but beat the Italian team 2\u20131 to finish third meaning they could not contest for a medal. In the classification rounds, to find overall placement, Britain lost to Sweden, but then beat Italy 2\u20131 again to finish seventh out of eight teams. Thomas was not the only member of the British ice sledge hockey team of 2006 to also compete in Summer Paralympics. Among the team were world record holding javelin thrower Nathan Stephens and gold medal sprinter Richard Whitehead."]}, {"page": "Wales at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=left|Nathan Stephens"]}]}}
