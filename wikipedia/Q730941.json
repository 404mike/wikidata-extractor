The game features a rudimentary engine built in Adventure Game Studio. Because of this restricted approach, the game's maps are largely static building cutaways. Trilby's graphical style, combined with its stealth gameplay, has drawn comparisons to 1990's Bonanza Bros. In turn, Trilby likely influenced later indie stealth games such as 2013's Gunpoint and 2015's Master Spy."]}, {"page": "5 days a stranger", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Trilby's Notes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Chris & Trilby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "7 Days a Skeptic", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "5 Days a Stranger", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "The \"John DeFoe\" Series", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "DeFoe Manor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "7 days a skeptic", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "7 days a sceptic", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "5 Days A Stranger series", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "6 Days a Sacrifice", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "5 Days a Stranger series", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "The Chzo Mythos", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "CHZO", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "John DeFoe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Chzo", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Croshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts", "response": ["#Redirect Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Mogworld", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "7 Days A Skeptic", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Tall Man (Trilby's Notes)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Chzo Mythos", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo_Mythos "]}, {"page": "The Days Series", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Rob Blanc", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Rob Blanc Trilogy"]}, {"page": "Anna (video game)", "response": ["Anna received \"Mixed or average reviews,\" according to Metacritic. The graphics, story and sound were praised, but it was criticized for the obscurity of its narrative, complexity of its interface, poor translation, and difficulty of its puzzles. The horror elements were both praised and criticized by different reviews; IGN's Anthony Gallegos initially praised the horror aspects but lamented that \"most of the fear factor is neutered after you realize nothing can harm you.\" Destructoid's Holly Green praised the atmosphere, but claimed \"the pre-release screenshots feel a bit misleading.\" VideoGamer's Lewis Denby liked the \"genuine scares here and there,\" but felt similarly to Gallego about the lack of challenge. The puzzles met a far more divisive reaction. Denby thought that \"Most of the puzzles don't make any sense,\" while Gallegos confided that many of the puzzles were \"anger-inducing,\" describing them as \"really just trial and error situations.\" Green noted that the lack of hints turned the puzzle-solving into \"a game of pin the tail on the donkey,\" but noted that the interface helped reduce the frustration of pixel-hunting. Web-reviewer Yahtzee Croshaw praised the horror but claimed the immersion was broken by the necessity of a walkthrough.  Both Green and Denby agreed that the quality of the translation was poor; Denby felt that the translation was \"garbled.\" Green declared \"the translation's biggest casualty is the narrative behind the protagonist's obsession with Anna.\" All three critics agreed that the User Interface was unpolished. Gallegos felt that it was \"sub-par,\" and both Denby and Green found it to be an area of frustration."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Richard \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Benjamin \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Yahtzee Croshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Ben Croshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Trilbys notes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw#Chzo Mythos"]}, {"page": "Yahtzee Crowshaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Will Save the Galaxy for Food", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yahtzee Croshaw"]}, {"page": "Star Control: Origins", "response": ["Star Control: Origins has a Metacritic score of 75, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Yahtzee Croshaw of Zero Punctuation ranked it 4th on his list of the Top 5 Best Games of 2018. IGN's Dan Stapleton gave Star Control: Origins a review score of 6.9/10 praising the game's combat system and humorous dialogue, but criticizing the repetitive gameplay of planetary resource gathering. This was echoed by PC Gamer's Ian Birnbaum, who  gave Star Control: Origins a review score of 60/100 criticizing the game's depth and the amount of grinding in gathering resources on planets, while still praising the humor in the dialog. Richard Corbett of PC Gamer would later acknowledge issues with the game's mechanics, while still praising Origins as his favorite game story in 2018. GameSpot's David Wildgoose rated the game at 6/10, stating \"at its best, Star Control: Origins urges you to poke and prod into every corner of its intimidatingly vast galaxy, searching out ancient secrets and pun-filled absurdities. At its worst, it drags you through mediocre arcade sequences and generic grind\". Stardock reports that Star Control: Origins received 10,000 pre-orders, leading to sales of 50,000 copies after one week of distribution."]}, {"page": "Twelve Minutes", "response": ["Some reviewers expressed strong criticism of the amount of domestic violence, particularly that is forced onto the wife in order to progress in the game. Renata Price of Kotaku stated that while it was possible that a story could include this type of violence if it was well crafted, its inclusion within Twelve Minutes was \"pretentious and exhausting\", and considered the twist ending \"terrible\". According to Polygon Samit Sarkar, the staff at Polygon were split whether the violence was necessary to serve the game's story, but Sarkar also was concerned with the lack of any disclaimers related to the violence or other troublesome topics at the start of the game. Twelve Minutes had been released near the same time as Boyfriend Dungeon, which on its initial release also had received similar criticism related to darker, mature content that had not been alluded to through pre-release materials or in-game content warnings. Both games were considered examples of where proper in-game content warnings would be necessary to warning players about disturbing content before encountering it. Yahtzee Croshaw of Zero Punctuation called the game \"absorbing, up to a point\", but noted that \"the game kind of fell apart\" past the plot twist and noted that he considered the ending so unsatisfying that it made him unsure if it was the real ending.https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/twelve-minutes-zero-punctuation/"]}]}}
