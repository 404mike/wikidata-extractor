Working paper No. 40, World Institute of Development Economics Research, Helsinki 1988;  According to the NAIRU concept, price stability in market-based societies necessarily requires a certain amount of unemployment. One reason a reserve army of the unemployed exists in market economies, it is argued, is that if the level of unemployment is too low, it will stimulate price inflation. However, the validity of this argument depends also on state economic policy and on the ability of workers to raise their wages. If for example trade unions are legally blocked from organizing workers, then even if unemployment is relatively low, average wages can be kept low; the only way that individual workers have in that case to raise their income is to work more hours or work themselves up to better-paying jobs."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2007", "response": ["*Andrew Glyn, 64, British economist."]}, {"page": "List of Marxian economists", "response": ["|Andrew Glyn"]}, {"page": "List of Corpus Christi College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Andrew Glyn \u2013 Fellow and Tutor in Economics"]}, {"page": "Euclid Tsakalotos", "response": ["Tsakalotos went on to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at The Queen's College, Oxford.
