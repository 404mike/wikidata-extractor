He took five wickets in an innings fifteen times, and ten wickets in a match on four occasions.\nInitially McHugh was a distinctly fast bowler who came into the Yorkshire team with a major injury to Ron Aspinall who was heading the bowling averages early in 1949. He did modestly and with the presence of Coxon, Trueman and Appleyard, was discarded and did not play even in the Second Eleven in 1950. McHugh then went to Gloucestershire and upon qualifying he quickly found that his accuracy could only become of county standard when he moderated his pace. Consequently, McHugh became with George Lambert the best pace attack Gloucestershire \u2013 a county known for half a century for its near-exclusive reliance on spin bowling \u2013 had fielded to that point in the twentieth century. In 1954 he took ninety-two wickets for exactly twenty runs each, and in 1955 did almost as well with over seventy-five wickets, whilst in 1956 his average fell further to only nineteen runs a wicket.\nMcHugh's batting was consistently inept.  His average of 2.63 is the lowest by anyone to play more than fifty first-class games. 66 of his 111 innings were scoreless (he was dismissed for a duck 38 times), and he reached double figures on only four occasions. It was probably the liability of his batting that caused Gloucestershire to discard him in favour of David Smith for the 1957 season: McHugh had suffered from illness during 1956, and did not play after June, but had bowled so well in his last-ever game with eleven wickets for 112 runs that he was expected to continue in 1957.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["The lowest career batting average by a player with more than fifty first-class matches is almost certainly 2.63 by Francis McHugh of Yorkshire (three matches) and Gloucestershire (92 matches) between 1949 and 1956.Cricket record lists do not keep records for lowest batting average, but Bailey, Phillip; Thorn, Phillip; and Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Complete Who\u2019s Who of Cricketers () shows nobody with nearly so low an average McHugh batted in 111 innings for only 179 runs, with only four double figure scores.

Unable to displace regular wicketkeeper Andy Wilson, who was a far better batsman, he played just two first-class games in 1952 and one in 1953, and made only eight appearances in 1954, when Wilson was 44. In 1955, however, Rochford took over as the regular wicketkeeper, playing in 30 matches and making 60 dismissals, and being awarded his county cap. His batting did not develop, however, and his highest score of the season was just 16 not out. There were a few signs of batting improvement in 1956 when, with 31 not out against Oxford University, Rochford made his highest score, and with Bryan Wells, Sam Cook and Francis McHugh in Gloucestershire's side, Rochford often batted far higher in the order than his batting talent warranted. He again made 60 dismissals in the season. After a few matches in 1957, he lost his place and with both Bobby Etheridge and Barrie Meyer available, he left the Gloucestershire staff at the end of the season. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1993 indicates that there was friction between Rochford and the Gloucestershire committee."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Francis McHugh (1952\u20131956) : F.
