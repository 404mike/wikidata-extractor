Illustrated in a watercolour perspective prepared by Axel Haig, the staircase was long thought never to have been built but recent research has shown that it was constructed, only to be torn out in the 1930s, reputedly after the third Marchioness had \"once slipped on its polished surface.\" The staircase was not universally praised in the contemporary press; the Building News writing that the design was \"one of the least happy we have seen from Mr Burges's pencil...the contrasts of colour are more startling than pleasing.\" The Arab Room in the Herbert Tower was the last room on which Burges was working when he fell ill in 1881. Bute placed Burges's initials, together with his own and the date, in the fireplace of that room as a memorial. The room was completed by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan.", "Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \"the most talented Gothicist of his day\"."]}, {"page": "The Tower House", "response": ["Burges bought the lease on the plot of land in 1875. The house was built by the Ashby Brothers, with interior decoration by members of Burges's long-standing team of craftsmen such as Thomas Nicholls and Henry Stacy Marks. By 1878 the house was largely complete, although interior decoration and the designing of numerous items of furniture and metalwork continued until Burges's death in 1881. The house was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. It was later sold to Colonel T.\u00a0H. Minshall and then, in 1933, to Colonel E.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. Graham. The poet John Betjeman inherited the remaining lease in 1962 but did not extend it. Following a period when the house stood empty and suffered vandalism, it was purchased and restored, first by Lady Jane Turnbull, later by the actor Richard Harris and then by the musician Jimmy Page.", "The lease on the house was inherited by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Pullan completed some of Burges's unfinished projects and wrote two studies of his work. The lease was then purchased by Colonel T. H. Minshall, author of What to Do with Germany and Future Germany, and father of Merlin Minshall. Minshall sold his lease to Colonel E. R. B. and Mrs. Graham in 1933. The Tower House was designated a Grade I listed building on 29 July 1949.", "Richard Popplewell Pullan described the house in detail in the second of two works he wrote about his brother-in-law, The House of William Burges, A.R.A., published in 1886.  The book contains photographs of the interior of the house by Francis Bedford. In 1893, the building was the only private house to be recorded in an article in The Builder, which gave an overview of the architecture of the previous fifty years.  It was referenced again a decade latter by Muthesius, who described it as, \"The most highly developed Gothic house to have been built in the 19th century (and) the last to be built in England\". It was then largely ignored, James Stourton describing its early twentieth-century decline as \"a paradigm of the reputation of the Gothic Revival\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Texier", "response": ["* , 1864 \u2013 Translated into English and published as Byzantine architecture : illustrated by examples of edifices erected in the East during the earliest ages of Christianity, London, (with Richard Popplewell Pullan), 1864.", "* The principal ruins of Asia Minor, London, (with Richard Popplewell Pullan), 1865.WorldCat Identities (published works)"]}, {"page": "Pullen", "response": ["* Richard Popplewell Pullan (1825\u20131888), English architect and arch\u00e6ologist"]}, {"page": "Richard Lane (architect)", "response": ["A number of distinguished students were apprenticed to the practice of Richard Lane and Peter B.

Pullan was helping Charles Thomas Newton excavate the ancient Greek city of Knidos three miles away. The statue had crowned an 18-metre high funerary monument, which had commanding views over the sea and may have once acted as a navigation aid for passing sailors. The monument may have been destroyed in an earthquake, as the statue was found lying some distance from the tomb. The Knidos Lion was transported with some difficulty further down the coast, where it was loaded onto the naval ship HMS Supply by Robert Murdoch Smith and shipped to London."]}, {"page": "Robert Murdoch Smith", "response": ["The Lion of Knidos was found in 1858 by the architect Richard Popplewell Pullan near where he was helping Newton's Knidos excavations.British Museum Collection The Lion of Knidos, British Museum.

Other pieces of worked stone lay around where they had been abandoned. Smith was able to replace, examine and move each of the remaining stones, and to create a detailed report on the supposed construction and its historical context. This allowed Pullen to sketch what is thought to be a good reproduction of what the whole mausoleum would have looked like.

Above it, Burges added two further storeys and the battlemented roof. The tower contains two of Burges's \"finest miniature interiors\", Bute's study and the Arab room. The latter room is one of Burges's masterpieces, John Newman describing it as \"the most exotic in the castle\". Its jelly-mould ceiling in a Moorish style is drawn from Burges's studies of Islamic art in Spain and Sicily, and from a book on the architecture of Cairo published in 1877. John Grant, the architect employed at the castle by the fourth Marquess, and author of a history of the building published in 1923, incorrectly stated that \"the decoration is based on an actual room in Arabia\", as well as repeatedly misspelling Burges's surname.  As usual, Burges led on every aspect of the room's design, including the stained glass, the marbled floor and walls, the gilded parrots on the cornice, the cedar wood wall cabinets inlaid with silver and the statuettes of Eastern deities. It was the last room on which he was working when he fell ill in 1881. After his death in April of that year, Bute placed Burges's initials, together with his own, and the date, in the fireplace of the Arab Room as a memorial. The room was completed by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. The room is almost exactly contemporaneous with the Arab Hall constructed by Frederick, Lord Leighton in his Holland Park house and illustrates the later Victorian obsession with the Orient."]}]}}
