Elsewhere, she provides a delicate solo vocal on The Fairy Boy, before being joined by Belinda O'Hooley's bravely sparse piano accompaniment, and demonstrates more gutsy singing on a rousing Maids When You're Young. But the best songs are the bleakest: Death is a thoughtful setting for verses supposedly written by Anne Boleyn before her execution, while Bricks and Love is a self-composed ballad of death and the folk scene, based on a true story.
