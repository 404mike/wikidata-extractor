He found that \"Davies's strength is her feel for character and place\" but also that \"the characters lapse into self pity [\u2026.]\". Billington judged that \"[\u2026]  her dialogue has that wry, laconic quality you often find in East Anglian plays\" adding that  \"Davies also vividly captures Amy's muddled feelings about motherhood: her resentment of an unwanted child combined with irrepressible familial instinct\". He concluded his review by noting, \"Even if this is only the sketch for the richer play Davies will one day write, she is well served by Lyndsey Turner's Theatre Upstairs production. Kate O'Flynn's Amy is a model of gawky despair while Russell Tovey's Gary has an edge of violence that, with memories of Bond's Saved in mind, makes you fear for the baby's survival. Sorcha Cusack as the commonsensical gran and Gerard Horan as an embittered victim of rural blight fill out a play that provides plenty of evidence of youthful talent but that also leaves you wanting more. Perhaps one day Davies might take the plunge and write a two act play\".", "In the Evening Standard, Nicholas de Jongh began his 4-star review by saying, \"It may be set in a Norfolk village last year but Molly Davies's highly promising, first full-length play reminds me irresistibly of Edward Bond's 44-year-old Saved without the violence. In 28 scenes and 80 minutes Miss Davies offers a rural complement to Bond's landscape-vision of down-and-out south Londoners. She shows a flair for creating believable characters, who speak in a terse, unembroidered Norfolk dialect that left me wishing for surtitles\". He praised both \"Kate O'Flynn's beautiful rendering of passivity, selfishness and vulnerability\" and the \"fine, lumbering incoherence\" of Russell Tovey's portrayal of Gary. De Jongh also noted the \"alienated aggression\" brought to the part of Gary's father by Gerard Horan, adding \"Sorcha Cusack's believable Gran offers the only ray of cheerfulness\". He judged that \"Lyndsey Turner's in-the-round production on a stage needlessly carpeted with turf offers annoyingly impeded views, though scenes flow with seamless ease\" but concluded his review by saying simply \"Compelling\"."]}, {"page": "Hot Money", "response": ["* Gerard Horan as Don Watmore"]}, {"page": "Toby Swift", "response": ["| Gerard Horan, Glyn Grimstead, Ben Tibber, Joseph Tremain and Ray Lonnen", "| Caroline Catz, Ann Mitchell, Tanya Franks, Gerard Horan, Mark Lewis Jones and Harry Myers", "| James Daley, Pamela Banks, Stephen Greif, Carl Prekopp, Gerard Horan, Freddy White, Gerard McDermott, Jamie Borthwick, David O'Dell, Sam Dale, Bethan Walker, Paul Richard Biggin, Joseph Kloska, Emma Noakes and Saikat Ahamed", "| Kristopher Milnes, Freddy White, Gerard Horan, Fenella Woolgar, Leanne Rowe, James Daley, Ben Crowe, John Hasler, Amy Enticknap, John Rowe, Dan Starkey, Nyasha Hatendi, Sarah Bedi, Joan Walker and Tim James", "| Gerard Horan, Claire Harry, Tracie Bennett, Alison Pettitt and Carl Rice"]}, {"page": "Look Back in Anger (1989 film)", "response": ["Look Back in Anger is a 1989 British videotaped television production of John Osborne's play.
