When O'Brien met with the show's creator Sydney Newman, he told her that they were considering having her cut her hair and dye it black. O'Brien refused, saying, \"Why don't you just get Carole Ann Ford back?\" O'Brien had just come out of drama school when she was cast as Vicki; it was her first television acting job. Barry originally offered the role of Bennett to Bernard Archard, but he was unavailable. Ray Barrett was cast in the role, described as a \"Jekyll and Hyde character\". Barry had seen Barrett on television and noted his name due to his rugged face, and \"dug him out of the book\" when the time came. Barrett played Bennett as a \"normal, straight human being\" so as not to give the ending away. To preserve the mystery, Koquillion was credited in the first episode as being played by \"Sydney Wilson\", a name made up by the production team in tribute to two of the creators of Doctor Who, Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson. When designing Koquillion, costume designer Daphne Dare took inspiration from a close-up of a fly. Tom Sheridan was cast to play the voice of the rescue ship, the sand creature, and a robed figure; an agreement was made for him to be credited as 'Space Captain', which meant he could not portray the robed figure."]}, {"page": "The Power of the Daleks", "response": ["Bernard Archard returned in Pyramids of Mars (1975).

Amos thought that this request was strange considering that Joe was more likely to outlive him, hinting that Joe's death may not have been an accident. Following the funeral, Annie proposes to Amos, who tells her that he will have to think about it. Annie, feeling embarrassed, tells him to forget about it.
