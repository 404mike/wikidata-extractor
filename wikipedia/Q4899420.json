Only after intense and sustained pressure from Martyn did Blackwell agree to release the album. Commenting on that period, Martyn said, \"I was in a dreadful emotional state over that record. I was hardly in control of my own actions. The reason they finally released it was because I freaked: Please get it out!

There is no real evidence for this however, and he was at the time friendly with a number of women. He had platonic friendships with both Sophia Ryde and Beverly Martyn, with whom he was particularly close, although neither of these relationships developed. Dann speculates that the song may have been inspired by Drake's enthusiasm for hashish, a drug which the songwriter was using, according to close associates, to insulate himself from the world around him. Although he does not appear to have developed his drug habit further, it has been suggested that his tastes developed after his contact with Cale, who was struggling with a heroin habit.
