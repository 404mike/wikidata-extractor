Her life changed dramatically at the age of six when her paternal uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated to marry divorc\u00e9e Wallis Simpson. Margaret's father became king and her sister became heir presumptive, with Margaret second in line to the throne. During the Second World War the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada. During the war years she was considered too young to perform any official duties and instead continued her education.\nAfter the war Margaret became one of the world's most celebrated socialites, famed for her glamorous lifestyle and reputed romances. Most famously she fell in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend. In 1952 her father died, her sister became queen and Townsend divorced his wife, Rosemary. He proposed to Margaret early the following year. Many in the government believed that he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen's 22-year-old sister and the Church of England refused to countenance marriage to a divorced man. Margaret eventually abandoned her plans with Townsend and married photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1960; the Queen made him Earl of Snowdon. The couple had a son, David, and a daughter, Sarah, before divorcing in 1978.\nMargaret was a controversial member of the British royal family. Her divorce received much negative publicity and her private life was for many years the subject of intense speculation by media and royal-watchers. Her health gradually deteriorated in the final two decades of her life. She was a heavy smoker for most of her adult life and had a lung operation in 1985, a bout of pneumonia in 1993 and at least three strokes between 1998 and 2001. She died in London on 9 February 2002 after suffering a fourth and final stroke at the age of 71.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 21", "response": ["*1930 \u2013 Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (d. 2002)"]}, {"page": "February 9", "response": ["*  2002   \u2013 Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (b. 1930)"]}, {"page": "Harry Secombe", "response": ["Secombe died on 11 April 2001 at the age of 79, from prostate cancer, in hospital in Guildford, Surrey.
