He moved that Burghersh's promotion was in violation of Army regulations, and the resolution was carried by the House of Commons. Lord Westmorland was compelled to ask the King not to sign Burghersh's commissions, and they were accordingly cancelled. In July, Burghersh was actively engaged at the Battle of Talavera. He soon after replied to a letter of his father's on his abortive promotion in May, telling him that \"the military is a profession which I most sincerely love,\" but expressing his frustration at not occupying a situation more equal to his education and qualities. He served with the 3rd Dragoon Guards in their campaign in Portugal in 1810."]}, {"page": "Sir John McMahon, 1st Baronet", "response": ["McMahon was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1812, and died in 1817, having been made a Baronet shortly before his death.
