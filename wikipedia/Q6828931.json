Referring to a case in 1589, where one Richard Vale was both Coroner of the Queen's Household and one of the coroners for Middlesex, Sir Edward Coke reported that, despite Vale having presided alone where two coroners would have been expected, \"it was resolved that the indictment was well taken, for the intent and meaning of the act was performed, and the mischief recited in the act avoided as well when one person is coroner of the houshold (sic), and of the county also, as if there should be two several persons.\""]}, {"page": "Beaumont College", "response": ["* Michael Burgess (b.1946), Coroner to the Royal Household."]}, {"page": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["Under English law, an inquest is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death.
