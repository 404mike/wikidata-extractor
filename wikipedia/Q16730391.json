A film critic for Film Review and Radio Times, he has made contributions to the Radio Times Guide to Films, the Radio Times Guide to Science Fiction and Halliwell's Film Guide.  He has also served as film critic for BBC News 24, Front Row on BBC Radio 4, and on Sky News programme Sunrise.  He has worked for many of the long-established cinema magazines \u2013  Empire, Premiere and Total Film, an article in which \u2013  The Splat Pack \u2013 is credited for the first use of a term that is now part of film industry jargon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Terminator", "response": ["In 1991, Richard Schickel of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the film, giving it an \"A\" rating, writing that \"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film\".

Film4 gave it five stars, calling it the \"sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining.\" TV Guide gave the film four stars, referring to it as an \"amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget\u00a0... For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel.\" Empire gave it five stars, calling it \"as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets.\" The film database Allmovie gave it five stars, saying that it \"established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s.\" Alan Jones awarded it five stars out of five for Radio Times, writing that \"maximum excitement is generated from the first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five stars out of five, stating that \"on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg.

Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy.\" The Avengers also shared a Razzie Award for \"Worst Remake or Sequel\" with the 1998 adaptations of Psycho and Godzilla at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards.

From the daft prologue set in Bodega Bay where Hitchcock filmed The Birds to the soggy moggy climax, this is absurdly unscary and confusingly dull.\" In Horror Films FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Slashers, Vampires, Zombies, Aliens, and More, John Kenneth Muir praised the first half of the film, stating: \"Sleepwalkers starts out in fine form, as a serious, grim, involving horror film about the last two survivors of a species doing what they must to survive, Krige is incredibly sensual as the half-crazed mother who must be 'fed' through the act of sexual intercourse with her son.\" He then says that the latter half of the film \"devolves into a campy disaster.\""]}, {"page": "Near Dark", "response": ["Richard Corliss of Time magazine called Near Dark \"weird (and) beautiful\" and \"the all-time teenage vampire love story\".

Alan Jones of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five, calling it a \"1980s horror landmark\" and \"one of the best vampire movies ever made.\" Jones described it as a  \"visually stunning and frightening package, spinning a genuinely scary tale\" and highlighted the \"stand-out degenerate performances\" of Henriksen and Paxton."]}, {"page": "It Came from Outer Space", "response": ["Writing for The Radio Times, Alan Jones gave the film one star out of five and called it a \"lacklustre update\" which was \"proof positive that 40 years of technical advances can't compensate for poor production values, boring characters and a complete lack of thrills.\" He summarised: \"file this under 'don't bother.'\" Leonard Maltin called the original \"intriguing\" and \"remarkably sober for its era, with crisp performances and real restraint, even in its use of 3-D\" and the 1996 effort \"a much inferior remake, rather than the sequel the title suggests.\" In the New York Daily News, David Bianculli wrote that \"the fact that this is a remake not a sequel, yet carries the suffix II anyway, is a clue about how clearly the makers of this new version were thinking when they made it. In other words, not very.\""]}, {"page": "Inseminoid", "response": ["Alan Jones of Starburst magazine expressed a preference for the British members of the cast, calling Geeson \"absolutely first-rate\" but criticising the \"weak performances from the token Americans\", Robin Clarke and Jennifer Ashley. Praising the film's cost-effective production values, he stated that its depictions of violence carried Warren's \"particular trademark\". He added that Inseminoid is \"not faultless by any means\", citing a predictable and often \"ridiculous\" plot as one of the film's failings. However, he concluded that it met audience expectations for a science fiction B movie, describing it as \"far less routine and far more enjoyable than I had expected.\"", "Inseminoid has been criticised as a perceived imitation, \"knock-off\" or \"rip-off\" of the 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien. Peter Wright, a film historian and lecturer at the University of Liverpool, believes that the \"atmospheric\" cave sequences and the mess hall scene preceding Ricky's madness may have been inspired by Ridley Scott's film, comparing the former to the sequences set on the desolate planetoid and the latter to the violent reveal of the alien \"chestburster\". Wright considers the Alien connection potentially \"exploitative\"; to Barry Langford of the University of London, it underlines UK cinema's dependence on its US counterpart. Alan Jones argues that \"any similarity between Inseminoid and Alien is totally intentional. Except here is the basic idea contained in Alien taken to its sleaziest extreme.\" He finds one such parallel in the character of Kate (Stephanie Beacham), whom he likens to Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). However, he also regards Contamination (1980) and Scared to Death (1981) as less effective imitations of Scott. Edward Jones argues that the plot of Inseminoid also borrows from the novel Dracula (1897), the TV series The Bionic Woman (1976\u201378) and the films The Thing from Another World (1951) and Night of the Living Dead (1968)."]}, {"page": "Cinefantastique", "response": ["The magazine was responsible for introducing the work of several writers who have continued to produce important work in the film field, including Don Shay, Bill Warren, Tim Lucas, Mick Garris, Stephen Rebello, Steven Rubin, Dan Scapperotti, Dale Winogura, Jeffrey Frentzen, Paul M.

In December 1982, an article in Fangoria scheduled the film for release in February 1983. Xtro was released as early as March 1983 in the United Kingdom. When released on home video in 1983, the film was subject to a prosecution case in relation to British obscenity laws. Unlike many other \"video nasties\", as they were then called, Xtro had actually been passed uncut by the BBFC with an 18 certificate for theatrical release (with both the original and an alternate ending). The film even went on to reach 33rd place in the Gallup British video chart for 1983. ", "From contemporary reviews, Alan Jones wrote in Starburst that the film has \"occasional flashes of tangential inspiration\" but was \"really nothing very xtro-ordinary.\" finding that scenes did not scare him \"or even disgusted [him] to any great extent\" and that he would have liked more characterisation and that Bernice Stegers was \"horribly miscast\". Jones went on to state that the special effects were \"minor miracles of ingenuity\" for their low budget and he at least admired director Metcalfe for \"trying so earnestly to resuscitate low budget exploitation sf/horror films in this country.\" Jo Imeson of the Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as a \"sub s-f rip-off\" and that it was \"entirely lacking in the energy or resonances of It's Alive! horror-within-the-family genre.\" The review also noted \"flat acting\" stating that Bernice Stegers was \"weighed down by a depressingly one-dimensional role\".  The review did note that \"one or two effects are quite memorable-the cocoon in the bathroom, the revolving birth of a full-sized man\".\"Lor.\" of Variety found the film \"too silly and underdeveloped in story values to expand beyond diehard fans\" and that \"Harry B Davenport builds little suspense and no thrills in a film devoid of stuntwork or action scenes. It's just another \"check out that makeup\" exercise, consisting of brief scenes and poor continuity\" and that \"acting is flat, with Stegers [...] inexpressive and unattractively styled.\" Roger Ebert panned the film, awarding it 1 of 4 stars, calling the film \"ugly\" and \"despairing\" and further commenting, \"Most exploitation movies are bad, but not necessarily painful to watch. They may be incompetent, they may be predictable, they may be badly acted or awkwardly directed, but at some level the filmmakers are enjoying themselves and at least trying to entertain an audience. 'Xtro' is an exception, a completely depressing, nihilistic film, an exercise in sadness ... It's movies like this that give movies a bad name\". Stephen Hunter writing for The Baltimore Sun called the film \"the slimiest, wormiest, most nauseating film to come oozing into Baltimore in some time.\" that was \"almost wholly incomprehensible\" Hunter went on to state that \"what is most depressing about Xtro is that its performances are first-rate, especially Steger's as the distraught Mum\" and that the cinematographer by John Metcalfe \"displays a good deal of technical finesse, particularly the long, apartment sequence\""]}, {"page": "Alan Jones", "response": ["Alan Jones may refer to:", "*Alan Jones (bobsleigh) (born 1946), British Olympic bobsledder", "*Alan Jones (Australian cricketer) (born 1948), Australian cricketer", "*Alan Jones (Scottish cricketer) (1927\u20132009), Scottish cricketer", "*Alan Jones (cricketer, born 1938), Welsh cricketer", "*Alan Jones (cricketer, born 1957), former Welsh cricketer", "*Alan Jones (footballer, born 1939), Welsh football goalkeeper", "*Alan Jones (footballer, born 1944), Welsh football winger", "*Alan Jones (footballer, born 1945), Welsh footballer", "*Alan Jones (footballer, born 1951), English footballer", "*Alan Jones (racing driver) (born 1946), Australian racing driver and Formula One World Champion 1980", "*Alan Jones (radio broadcaster) (born 1941), Australian radio broadcaster and former rugby coach", "*Alan Jones (cinematographer), cinematographer active 1984\u20131996; see Love Is All There Is", "*Alan Jones (drummer) (born 1962), American jazz drummer", "*Alan Jones (bassist) (born 1947), English bass guitar player with groups such as The Shadows", "*Alan Jones (architect) (born 1964), Ulster architect", "*Alan Jones (priest) (born 1940), former Dean of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco", "*Alan Jones (diplomat) (born 1953), former British High Commissioner to Sierra Leone and Belize", "*Alan Jones (film critic), film critic, broadcaster and reporter"]}, {"page": "Puss in Boots (Shrek)", "response": ["Critics have praised Banderas's voicing.

According to Andrew Penn Romine, Banderas voiced Puss \"with feline gravitas\". Rob Carnevale called Banderas's performance \"inimitable\". IAmRogues Dana Gardner wrote that Banderas \"brought plenty of comedy to the role of Puss by playing the character so melodramatically\". Matt Fowler found Banderas \"perfectly suitable as Puss\", and Todd McCarthy called his performance \"spirited and knowing\". James Mottram praised \"Banderas's charm\" as well.

Donna Bowater of The Telegraph called Banderas's performance \"famous\". Jeff Otto said that Banderas \"lends a fantastic energy to the character\", making viewers \"wish for more of him\". Alan Jones of Radio Times also enjoyed Banderas's voice acting. According to an Empire reviewer, Puss was \"voiced to perfection by Banderas\". In the book titled Stars in World Cinema: Screen Icons and Star Systems Across Cultures, the authors wrote that the \"European roots\" of the fairy tale \"Puss in Boots\" were \"revived through the presence of Banderas\". They stated that while Banderas's \"on-screen persona\" had been based on \"his sensuality and body image\", he then exchanged this representation for the image of \"an animated ginger cat\". The writers also commented that Puss's voice \"was intended to speak to the audience's [internalized] views regarding accent and regional profile\"; they said it was \"vital\" for Puss \"not to belong to the dominant cultural group\" despite being \"adopted into that group\". In his book titled The Animated Movie Guide, author Jerry Beck wrote that Banderas voiced Puss with \"a Castilian accent\" in the Latin American version and with \"an Andalusian accent\" in the Spanish version; he mentioned that both accents sounded \"funny\" to their respective target audiences. Entertainment Weeklys Maureen Lee Lenker said that Puss had become a \"fan favorite\" after his first appearance in the Shrek franchise, mostly because of Banderas's \"smooth Spanish accent\"; the \"tie-in\" with Banderas was stated to \"largely\" contribute to Puss's popularity."]}, {"page": "Alexandre Aja", "response": ["In 2004, Aja was named by Variety on the Ten Directors to Watch list.
