In 1936, at the age of 18, he made his professional stage debut in a supporting role in the world premiere of Gladys Bronwyn Stern's Middle Man in Suffern, New York which starred actor Ernest Truex. It wasn't until a decade later, however, that Cimino would become dedicated full-time to an acting career.
