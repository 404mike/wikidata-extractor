He left England in 1816 too, escaping financial troubles. His last letter, written before departing, was to Davies, asking to borrow money. Davies refused to help. Later that year Davies and Hobhouse travelled to the Villa Diodati to visit Byron, and on the way saw Brummell in Calais. Brummell's inner circle, to which Davies belonged, included William Arden, 2nd Baron Alvanley, who stepped into his shoes as the ton's leading influence. Others in that set were Joshua Allen, 6th Viscount Allen known as \"King\" Allen, Thomas Foley, 3rd Baron Foley, Sir Henry Mildmay and Lord Sidney Godolphin Osborne. In 1813 Davies challenged Lord Foley to a duel: the matter was smoothed over by Byron. Charles Greville wrote of \"that set of rou\u00e9s and spendthrifts who were at the height of the fashion for some years\", including in it John Payne."]}]}}
