Forced into American exile following the suppression of the 1798 rebellion, he wrote A Letter from An Irish Emigrant (1799). Assailing the landed Anglican Ascendancy and vindicating the call for an Irish republic, it was the first published apologia for the United Irish insurrection. In the United States he found himself at odds with the spirit of evangelical revivalism.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Birch (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas Birch (1705\u20131766) was an English historian.", "Thomas Birch may also refer to:", "* Thomas Birch (artist) (1779\u20131851), American portrait and marine painter", "* Thomas Birch (New Zealand politician) (1825\u20131880), New Zealand politician who represented Dunedin", "* Sir Thomas Birch, 2nd Baronet (1791\u20131880), British MP for Liverpool", "* Thomas Birch (priest) (1767\u20131840), Archdeacon of Lewes, 1823\u20131840", "* Thomas Birch (English Parliamentarian) (1608\u20131678), English politician"]}]}}
