He had a particular interest in freshwater invertebrates.\nHe was brought up in southwest England, and educated at Wellington College, Berkshire and Christ's College, Cambridge. Although best known for his work in freshwater biology, his first job (1933\u201334) was on a scientific expedition to the Indian Ocean. The resulting volume on starfish (Asteroidea) became part of his PhD thesis. He was awarded his doctorate in 1940.\nIn 1935, he joined the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA). He worked there until his retirement in 1976, broken only by military service during World War II. In 1941, he was commissioned as Lieutenant into the Royal Army Medical Corps,; he subsequently rose to the rank of Major; he addressed problems relating to malaria in Iraq, Iran, India and Burma. In 1946, he returned to the FBA as Deputy Director.\nHis earliest work at the FBA was concerned with Corixidae (water boatmen) and gastropods. He then concentrated on a detailed taxonomic study of the British Ephemeroptera (mayflies), culminating in the publication in 1961 of the first complete guide to their nymphs (most recent edition 1979). During this work, he accumulated much information on the ecology of the various species, especially their habitats and life cycles. His principal locations of study were in Ford Wood Beck, a small stony stream near his home in Outgate near Hawkshead, Cumbria; and in Hodson's Tarn, a moorland lake close to the Windermere Laboratory of the FBA. After his retirement, he continued his studies in the River Lune, which runs through Cumbria and Lancashire. He was a prolific author of scientific papers and books; his Life in Lakes and Rivers (co-authored with E. B. Worthington) was at one time a set text in the Open University.\nIn addition to the teaching he did at the LBA, he was visiting lecturer at Lancaster University (1966\u201376) and the University of Toulouse (1968), and visiting professor at Idaho State University (1972) and Ohio University (1976\u201377). He was the founding editor (1971\u201373) of the journal Freshwater Biology. He was closely associated with the International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology, in which he served as General Secretary and Treasurer (1953\u201368), Editor (1953\u201362) and Vice-President (1968\u201372).\nAmong his outside interests, he was a keen sailor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Naturalist", "response": ["|T.

Moon at the Freshwater biological station at Windermere in England from 1934 to 1936, focusing on the Benthic zone fauna in the lakes of Cumbria. Her work looked at the taxonomy of the larval and pupal stages of Chironomidae (non-biting midges or chironomids), resulting in a publication in the Journal of Animal Ecology in 1936. Humphries continued her study of chironomids at the Hydrobiologische Anstalt (later the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Limnologie) at Pl\u00f6n from 1936 to 1938, working with August Thienemann. Thienemann was a co-founder of the International Society of Limnology, and he was influential in Humphries undertaking the first comprehensive study of community composition and emergence periods of the Chironomidae of the Gro\u00dfer Pl\u00f6ner See. This group are deemed particularly difficult to identify or \"taxonomically challenging\". The results of this study were published in 1937 and 1938. She developed a method for the identification of Chironomidae by examining the microscopic skin the adult fly sheds when emerging from the pupa."]}]}}
