He did not bat as Alan Barber (100) and Edgar Oldroyd (143) put on 203 for the second wicket, to help Yorkshire post 320 for 4.  He bowled 11 overs and took the wickets of Eddie Dawson and Alan Shipman for 21, before rain forced the abandonment of the final day's play.  His second, and final game, was the County Championship clash against Derbyshire again at Bramall Lane, in August.  Batting at number eleven, he fell leg before wicket to Tommy Mitchell for three runs, and his only success with the ball came when he dismissed Stan Worthington, caught by Frank Dennis, for six.  He finished with a first-class career bowling average of 30.00.He appeared for the Yorkshire Second XI from 1928 to 1930. For many years he played for Sheffield United Cricket Club, and also had a spell with Rawmarsh C.C.\nGoulder died in Sheffield in June 1986.", "link_mentions": {}}}
