He obtained his degree in Botany in (1946) and his MA and DPhil (1950) from Oxford with his doctoral thesis An investigation of the interaction of soil micro-organisms with special reference to the study of the bacterial population of plant root systems.   Dr Harper spent a further nine years conducting research at the Department of Agriculture, Oxford, and a sabbatical as Rockefeller Foundation Fellow at the University of California, Davis, he was in 1967 appointed head of the newly formed School of Plant Biology at Bangor University North Wales.\nHe served as president of the British Ecological Society (BES) (1966\u20131968) and of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (1993-1995).\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1978 and was their Darwin Medal recipient for 1990.  He received the Millennium Botany Award in 1999 and the Marsh Ecology Award from the BES the same year. He was awarded CBE in 1989.\nHe has authored several textbooks on ecology and population biology.\nThe British Ecological Society awards the John L. Harper Young Investigator's prize annually to the best paper in Journal of Ecology by a young author. He was a member of the British Humanist Association.He died on 22 March 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lawrence Sheriff School", "response": ["* John L.

Baker, and Melbourne with Bruce Knox, he used mathematical search theory to analyze seagrass pollination and later, with mathematician James Sethian used search theory to develop a new approach to the evolution of different size sperm and eggs, known as anisogamy, a topic he continued to pursue with Japanese biologist Tatsuya Togashi.

American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America 77(1): 44\u201351. was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was John L. Harper, who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy TurkingtonTurkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L.
