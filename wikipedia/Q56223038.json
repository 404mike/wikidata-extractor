Keith Curle made no changes to his Northampton Town team.  No presentation to dignitaries was held before the match: a minute's silence was held in remembrance of Theo Foley who had represented both clubs, before the players and officials took the knee to observe the Black Lives Matter movement.   Taylor reflected on Exeter's previous losses in play-off finals: \"We've got a recent history with Wembley and play-off finals and we certainly don't want to be left wanting at the end of this one... My memory's not gone back to those two occasions, when I was involved as a coach, because they were negative times in terms of the results that we got\".  Curle had suffered defeat to Exeter City in the play-off semi-final in 2017 when he was Carlisle United manager.  Northampton Town played in the black shirts and shorts of their away strip, with claret socks, while Exeter wore their traditional red and white shirts, with black and white shorts and socks.", "|MF ||27|| Archie Collins || || "]}]}}
