Publicist Tony Barrow saw Beatlemania as beginning with the band's appearance on that program, at which point he no longer had to contact the press but had the press contacting him. Scottish music promoter Andi Lothian said that he coined \"Beatlemania\" while speaking to a reporter at the band's Caird Hall concert, which took place as part of the Beatles' mini-tour of Scotland on 7 October.Radio interview , Radio Tay AM.

He then edited the Sunday Graphic from 1953-58 where his ideas and production flair attracted the attention of the then Lord Rothermere Esmond Harmsworth. He took up a new editorship at the Sunday Dispatch before moving to the Daily Mail in 1958 as assistant editor. He directed an internationally envied, intellectually diverse team of writers. Among them were Bernard Levin, Vincent Mulchrone, Shirley Conran, Godfrey Winn, Anne Scott-James, Quentin Crew, Barry Norman and Lynda Lee-Potter.  As executive editor in the 1970s and early 1980s, he headed the features department and was a key figure in the Femail marketing policy of attracting women readers without alienating its male readership."]}, {"page": "Mulchrone", "response": ["*Vincent Mulchrone (1923\u20131977), British journalist"]}]}}
