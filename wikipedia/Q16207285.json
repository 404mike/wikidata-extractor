The play met with instant acclaim from critics. Evelyn Curlet wrote in The Stage, \"Davies writes with punch and panache and has made a spare, powerful debut\", Charles Spencer wrote in the Telegraph that \"this proves a shattering full-length debut\" and Dominic Maxwell awarded a 4 star review, saying Davies was \"another striking success from the Court's new writers season\". A Miracle received strong reviews in several other UK newspapers and Davies was longlisted for the award for Most Promising Playwright in the 2009 Evening Standard Awards.In 2014 Davies's play God Bless the Child was staged at the Royal Court, directed by Vicky Featherstone and with a cast including Amanda Abbington and Julie Hesmondhalgh. In 2015, Ms. Davies became the first female playwright to win the Pinter Commission.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evening Standard Theatre Awards", "response": ["* 2015\u00a0\u2013 Molly Davies for God Bless The Child"]}, {"page": "Steven Atkinson", "response": ["* Chicken by Molly Davies, directed by Steven Atkinson (2015)"]}, {"page": "Orpheus and Eurydice", "response": ["* Orpheus and Eurydice: A Myth Underground, a theatre production written by Molly Davies with music by James Johnston, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds for the National Youth Theatre at the Old Vic Tunnels, directed by James Dacre (2011)"]}, {"page": "2009 in literature", "response": ["*Molly Davies \u2013 A Miracle"]}, {"page": "A Miracle", "response": ["A Miracle by Molly Davies was her first professionally staged play and was staged first at the upstairs Jerwood Theatre at Royal Court Theatre in London in 2009 as part of the theatre's Young Writers Festival. It starred Russell Tovey, Kate O'Flynn, Sorcha Cusack and Gerard Horan.", "Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer began by saying, \"I'm in a tricky position here. There is nothing I can say about Molly Davies's remarkable play A Miracle that is going to make you want to see it. Almost throughout its 75 minute running time (it feels much longer) I was desperate to get out of the theatre myself\", before adding, \"But this is emphatically a drama that deserves and needs to be seen, not least by those politicians who endlessly bang on about our broken society\". Spencer recalled that, \"Babies don't tend to survive for long in Royal Court plays (Remember Edward Bond's  Saved?) and poor Cara spends much of the time crying, horribly realistically, in her buggy, shredding the nerves of every parent in the audience\", but found, \"It's worth enduring, though, not only for the power and truth of both writing and performances, but also for the tentative glimmer of hope at the end\". Assessing the cast's performances, he judged that \"Kate O'Flynn brings an astonishingly raw vulnerability to the stage as Amy [\u2026] Sorcha Cusack plays the grandmother with a robust humanity that warms this punishing play; Russell Tovey has a terrifying touch of the psycho about him as the squaddie, while Gerard Horton as his father shows how man hands on misery to man\". Spencer concluded his review by writing, \"With a bleakly atmospheric rural design by Patrick Burnier that is so real you can actually smell it and a tense, gutsy production by Lyndsey Turner, this proves a shattering full-length debut by 26-year-old Molly Davies\".", "Reviewing the play for The Guardian,  Michael Billington gave it 3 stars out of five, saying that \"while Molly Davies's writing shows real flair in its bony, Bond-like spareness and unnerving hints of violence, her play remains trapped inside the fashionable 70-minute format\". He found that \"Davies's strength is her feel for character and place\" but also that \"the characters lapse into self pity [\u2026.]\". Billington judged that \"[\u2026]  her dialogue has that wry, laconic quality you often find in East Anglian plays\" adding that  \"Davies also vividly captures Amy's muddled feelings about motherhood: her resentment of an unwanted child combined with irrepressible familial instinct\". He concluded his review by noting, \"Even if this is only the sketch for the richer play Davies will one day write, she is well served by Lyndsey Turner's Theatre Upstairs production. Kate O'Flynn's Amy is a model of gawky despair while Russell Tovey's Gary has an edge of violence that, with memories of Bond's Saved in mind, makes you fear for the baby's survival. Sorcha Cusack as the commonsensical gran and Gerard Horan as an embittered victim of rural blight fill out a play that provides plenty of evidence of youthful talent but that also leaves you wanting more. Perhaps one day Davies might take the plunge and write a two act play\".", "In the Evening Standard, Nicholas de Jongh began his 4-star review by saying, \"It may be set in a Norfolk village last year but Molly Davies's highly promising, first full-length play reminds me irresistibly of Edward Bond's 44-year-old Saved without the violence. In 28 scenes and 80 minutes Miss Davies offers a rural complement to Bond's landscape-vision of down-and-out south Londoners. She shows a flair for creating believable characters, who speak in a terse, unembroidered Norfolk dialect that left me wishing for surtitles\". He praised both \"Kate O'Flynn's beautiful rendering of passivity, selfishness and vulnerability\" and the \"fine, lumbering incoherence\" of Russell Tovey's portrayal of Gary. De Jongh also noted the \"alienated aggression\" brought to the part of Gary's father by Gerard Horan, adding \"Sorcha Cusack's believable Gran offers the only ray of cheerfulness\". He judged that \"Lyndsey Turner's in-the-round production on a stage needlessly carpeted with turf offers annoyingly impeded views, though scenes flow with seamless ease\" but concluded his review by saying simply \"Compelling\"."]}, {"page": "Suzushi Hanayagi", "response": ["From 1984 and continuing throughout the 1990s, Hanayagi served as the choreographer for over fifteen seminal productions and projects by stage director and designer Robert Wilson.http://www.robertwilson.com/suzushi-hanayagi Their collaborations were mostly large-scale theater and opera productions presented internationally, beginning with the Knee Plays, premiered at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiygSfpJoW0 as part of Wilson's multi-sectioned work, The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down.
