Asher-Perrin notes that the miniseries played down the negative aspects emphasized by the Lynch film, and writes, \"[The Baron's] appearance was not altered to make him seem ill, he never physically attacks anyone, and the miniseries paid more attention to the fact that the Baron was a rapist, his preference for men being incidental.\" He also praises McNeice as a standout among the cast, writing that he \"manages to make the Baron Harkonnen\u2014easily one of the most despicable characters in science fiction literature\u2014every bit as conniving and vicious as he needs to be...and every bit as fascinating. McNeice has a superb sense of how to make the baron mesmerizing to watch no matter how odiously he behaves\".
