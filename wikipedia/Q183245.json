He said \"I paint ideas, not things.\" Watts became famous in his lifetime for his allegorical works, such as Hope and Love and Life. These paintings were intended to form part of an epic symbolic cycle called the \"House of Life\", in which the emotions and aspirations of life would all be represented in a universal symbolic language.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Circe", "response": ["The tradition of dressing up in character continued into the following centuries.

That year, he also reluctantly agreed to sit for a portrait by establishment painter George Frederic Watts. Morris was keenly interested in Icelandic literature, having befriended the Icelandic theologian Eir\u00edkur Magn\u00fasson. Together they produced prose translations of the Eddas and Sagas for publication in English. Morris also developed a keen interest in creating handwritten illuminated manuscripts, producing 18 such books between 1870 and 1875, the first of which was A Book of Verse, completed as a birthday present for Georgina Burne-Jones. 12 of these 18 were handwritten copies of Nordic tales such as Halfdan the Black, Frithiof the Bold, and The Dwellers of Eyr. Morris deemed calligraphy to be an art form, and taught himself both Roman and italic script, as well as learning how to produce gilded letters. In November 1872 he published Love is Enough, a poetic drama based on a story in the Medieval Welsh text, the Mabinogion. Illustrated with Burne-Jones woodcuts, it was not a popular success. By 1871, he had begun work on a novel set in the present, The Novel on Blue Paper, which was about a love triangle; it would remain unfinished and Morris later asserted that it was not well written."]}, {"page": "1904", "response": ["* July 1 \u2013 George Frederic Watts, British symbolist painter and sculptor (born 1817)"]}, {"page": "Somerville College, Oxford", "response": ["Today House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar.
