In early 1969 Keith Relf formed Renaissance with McCarty and two other musicians, and Jane Relf on vocals. The Relfs and McCarty left Renaissance in 1970.\nAt the time of his death in 1976, Keith Relf was in the process of re-forming the original lineup of Renaissance, including Jane. Following Keith's accidental death by electrocution, Jane and the other surviving original members of Renaissance proceeded with the project and formed Illusion, with Jane and McCarty as lead vocalists.  Illusion recorded two albums before dissolving in 1979.\nSince the dissolution of Illusion, Jane Relf has sung on various McCarty-led projects including Stairway and Renaissance Illusion.\nJane has released one solo single \"Without a Song From You\" b/w \"Make My Time Pass By\" in 1971 and also recorded a promotional single \"The Fishermen\" for Findus Frozen Foods.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey", "response": ["*Jane Relf (born 1947) was born and grew up in Richmond, then part of Surrey."]}, {"page": "Renaissance (band)", "response": ["The original line-up included two former members of the Yardbirds, Keith Relf and Jim McCarty, along with John Hawken, Louis Cennamo and Relf's sister Jane Relf.

Montclair, NJ: Blackbeat Books. p. 130.  Renaissance was born, and the band released a studio album in 1969, and another in 1971. Subsequently, John Tout replaced Hawken on keyboards, followed by a period of high turnover of musicians until the \"classic line-up\" of Annie Haslam, John Tout, Michael Dunford, Jon Camp, and Terry Sullivan was established, although none of them were in the original band. They were assisted with lyrics on many songs from Cornish poet Betty Thatcher-Newsinger. From 1972 to 1979 Renaissance released seven successful studio albums, toured extensively, and sold out three nights in a row at Carnegie Hall with Tony Cox conducting the New York Philharmonic.Snider, Charles (2007).

This line-up recorded one track, \"Mr Pine\", a Dunford composition, and played a few gigs during the summer of 1970. Meanwhile, a final recording session brought together the original line-up minus Hawken, with Don Shin sitting in on keyboards, and produced the album's closing track \"Past Orbits of Dust\". The now completed Illusion was released in Germany in 1971, although it was not released in the UK until 1976 (Island HELP 27). The album marked the beginning of Renaissance's long-standing collaboration with poet Betty Thatcher-Newsinger as lyricist when she co-wrote two songs with Relf and McCarty.", "The two remaining original members left in late 1970; Jane Relf was replaced by American folk singer Anne-Marie \"Binky\" Cullom, then John Hawken left to join Spooky Tooth and pianist John Tout replaced him. There is an extant video (released on the DVD \"Kings & Queens\" in 2010) of that line-up performing five songs on a German TV program (Muzik-Kanal). The plan at the time was that Relf and McCarty would remain involved as non-performing members \u2013 Relf as a producer and McCarty as a songwriter. Both were present when singer Annie Haslam successfully auditioned in January 1971 to replace the departing Cullom (who would later marry drummer Terry Slade and retire from the music scene). While McCarty would go on to write songs for the new band, Relf's involvement would be short-lived. Dunford soon emerged as a prolific composer, and continued the writing partnership with Thatcher, who would go on to write most of the lyrics for the band's 1970s albums."]}, {"page": "Keith Relf", "response": ["After the Yardbirds broke up in July 1968, Relf formed the acoustic duo Together, with fellow Yardbird Jim McCarty, followed immediately by Renaissance (which also featured his sister Jane Relf).
