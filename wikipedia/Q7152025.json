Lewis joined The Guardian as a trainee in 2005, and was Stern Fellow at The Washington Post in 2007. In August 2010 Lewis became head of The Guardian's \"multimedia special projects team\" which aims to find \"new angles on breaking news stories, including using multimedia and crowdsourcing\".Lewis was named \"Reporter of the Year\" in 2010 at the British Press Awards for his work exposing details of the death of Ian Tomlinson at the 2009 G20 summit protests. This work was also recognised with the Bevins Prize (2009) for outstanding investigative journalism. The Bevins Trust said of his investigation:\nPaul uncovered the truth by persistently questioning and challenging the police account, by following up on the family, and assiduously garnering eye-witness evidence, until finally he obtained incontrovertible video evidence from a bystander who filmed the incident. In achieving this Paul used every method now available to a modern journalist, online and in print, to keep pushing and nudging at the story until he established what had really happened. His work led to internal and independent police inquiry, extensive and international public comment, and has changed the way police behave in potential riot situations, and how they receive and investigate complaints into such incidents. All in all, his story was a triumph for the assertion of civil liberty, as well as a revelation about policing conduct.\nAt TEDxThessaloniki in April 2011 he gave a talk on how citizen journalism and social media had helped him report on the Ian Tomlinson case and the unlawful killing of Jimmy Mubenga. In 2013, he received the Innovation Award by the European Press Prize for his project 'Reading the Riots'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cambridge Students' Union", "response": ["* Paul Lewis (King's), journalist at The Guardian, President 2002\u201303"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Labour Club", "response": ["*Paul Lewis, The Guardian journalist"]}, {"page": "Orwell Prize", "response": ["**Paul Lewis", "**Paul Lewis"]}, {"page": "Paul Lewis", "response": ["Paul Lewis may refer to:", "*Paul Lewis (architect), American architect and professor at the Princeton University School of Architecture", "*Paul Lewis (broadcaster) (born 1948), British radio broadcaster and financial journalist", "*Paul Lewis (field hockey) (born 1966), Australian field hockey player", "*Paul Lewis (footballer) (born 1994), British association footballer", "*Paul Lewis (journalist) (born 1981), British newspaper journalist", "*Paul Lewis (professor), American professor of literature", "*Paul Lewis (pianist) (born 1972), English classical pianist", "*Paul Lewis (racing driver) (born 1932), American NASCAR driver", "*Paul Lewis (soccer) (born 1999), American association footballer (soccer player)", "*Paul Lewis, film producer of The Hot Spot"]}, {"page": "Laurence Stern fellowship", "response": ["* 2007 - Paul Lewis, The Guardian"]}, {"page": "Paul Foot Award", "response": [":Paul Lewis (The Guardian) on the death of Ian Tomlinson at the 2009 G20 London summit protests."]}, {"page": "The Guardian", "response": ["* Reporter of the Year (Nick Davies, 2000; Paul Lewis, 2010;Press Gazette, Roll of Honour , accessed 24 July 2011 Rob Evans & Paul Lewis, 2014);", "* Bevins Prize for investigative journalism (Paul Lewis, 2010);"]}, {"page": "Death of Ian Tomlinson", "response": ["Ian Tomlinson (7 February 1962\u00a0\u2013 1 April 2009) was a newspaper vendor who collapsed and died in the City of London after being struck by a police officer during the 2009 G-20 summit protests.
