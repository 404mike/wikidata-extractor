Friedrich Hayek had suggested that an intellectual counterweight was necessary to combat the prevailing Keynesian consensus \"Butskellism\" of R. A. Butler and Hugh Gaitskell. Harris, together with editorial director Arthur Seldon, built the IEA into a bastion of free market liberal economics. The IEA developed links with economists such as Friedrich Hayek, Gottfried Haberler, Harry Johnson, Milton Friedman, George Stigler and James Buchanan, and published many pamphlets and papers on public finance issues, such as taxation, pensions, education, health, transport, and exchange rates."]}, {"page": "Hampshire North and Oxford (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Graham Mather"]}, {"page": "2017 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Graham Mather \u2013 President, European Policy Forum.
