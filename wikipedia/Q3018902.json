He discovered the first human coronavirus (designated B814) in 1965. With June Almeida he made the first comparative study of human and chicken coronaviruses in 1967, and invented the name coronavirus in 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coronavirus", "response": ["The name \"coronavirus\" is derived from Latin corona, meaning \"crown\" or \"wreath\", itself a borrowing from Greek  kor\u1e53n\u0113, \"garland, wreath\". The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses. The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo. This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.", "Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States. E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated B814 in 1961. The virus could not be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea. The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn. The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope. Dorothy Hamre and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students in 1962. They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, designating it 229E. The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether."]}, {"page": "Common Cold Unit", "response": ["Human coronaviruses, which are responsible for about 10% of common colds, were first isolated from volunteers at the unit in 1965. The CCU continually recruited volunteers for research into the common cold until its closure in 1990. The final  director was David Tyrrell, whose autobiography describes his work at the CCU from 1957.", "Our current understanding of colds have began in 1914 when Dr. Kruse showed that nasal secretions from people with colds could be filtrated to make them free from bacteria and that inoculation of those filtrated washes into the nose of recipients caused the same illness. Christopher Andrewes and David Tyrrell refined these experiments at Harvard Hospital in Salisbury, England. Around 1946 this hospital became the Common Cold Unit of the Medical Research Council. The Common Cold Research Unit was set up by the Medical Research Council after Dr. Andrewes promoted the idea of researches on volunteers and persuaded authorities to set up the research station.", "First coronavirus (B814) was found in washes from a boy with a typical common cold symptoms in 1960 during the study led by virologist David Tyrrell at the Common Cold Unit. After washes were inoculated to volunteers and tested for known viruses none was found. Publication about first human coronavirus was published in The BMJ in 1965. Later virologist June Almeida imaged virus for the first time and group of eight virologists including June Almeida named it coronavirus in their publication in 1968."]}, {"page": "1978 smallpox outbreak in the United Kingdom", "response": ["An official government inquiry into Parker's death was conducted by a panel led by microbiologist R.A.

Tyrrell's team had been attempting to detect the presence of rhinoviruses in tissue cultures of cells that they had produced in the lab. They wanted to detect a specific respiratory virus they called B814. The Swedish professor Bertil Hoorn could make all Tyrrell's respiratory viruses in organ cultures of cells from the human airway in the laboratory, except for virus B814. This organ culture system meant they did not have to depend on human volunteers to do research on these viruses. They wanted a reliable method to detect virus B814.", "In 1966, using her new techniques, Almeida was able to identify a group of \"previously uncharacterised human respiratory viruses\", while collaborating with David Tyrrell, then director of the Common Cold Research Centre in Salisbury in Wiltshire. Tyrrell suggested calling the new group \"coronaviruses\". The coronavirus family of viruses now includes the SARS virus and the SARS-CoV2 virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019."]}, {"page": "David Tyrrell", "response": ["David Tyrrell may refer to:", "* David Tyrrell (footballer) (born 1985), Irish footballer", "* David Tyrrell (rugby league) (born 1988), Australian rugby league player", "* David Tyrrell (physician) (1925\u20132005), British virologist"]}, {"page": "Wendy Barclay", "response": ["Barclay graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge.
