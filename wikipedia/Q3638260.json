Several prospective companies were formed to transport these minerals, and the battle for authorisation in Parliament was reduced to a GWR-supported scheme, and the Whitchurch, Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway, promoted by Benjamin Piercy. The significance of Whitchurch was as an outlet to the London and North Western Railway there.Boyd, page 95"]}, {"page": "Barmouth Bridge", "response": ["Barmouth Bridge was designed by the civil engineers Benjamin Piercy and Henry Conybeare in 1864. Conybeare decided on the use of a timber viaduct because it was about four times cheaper to import wood from the Baltic by sea than to construct an iron bridge. The decision was influenced by the incorrect belief that the estuary was free from marine borers, which attack and weaken the timber over time. During this era, timber pile viaducts were commonplace on British coastal railways, although the bridge at Barmouth would be longer than most."]}, {"page": "1888 in Wales", "response": ["*24 March \u2013 Benjamin Piercy, civil engineer, 61"]}, {"page": "Llanidloes and Newtown Railway", "response": ["The railway construction was resumed with the excavation of Scafell cutting.

The selected route included the bridge now known as Pont Briwet, which was built to carry the line to the town of Porthmadog. During 1865, the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway company merged with the rival Cambrian Railways company. Shortly thereafter, boardroom struggles within the newly created company contributed to a delay in the project. Henry Conybeare briefly replaced Piercy as the company's chief engineer, before being himself replaced by Piercy's former deputy, George Owen. It is uncertain which of these were responsible for designing Pont Briwet."]}, {"page": "Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway", "response": ["The Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 31 July 1885, sponsored chiefly by Benjamin Piercy, who had become a promoter of railways, in collaboration with Henry Robertson MP. The capital was \u00a3180,000. However the economy suffered a serious trade depression at this time, and it proved impossible to raise the needed money. Worse was to follow in February 1888, when both Piercy and Robertson died.Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1991, , pages 161 and 162"]}, {"page": "Newtown and Machynlleth Railway", "response": ["There was still a considerable expanse of undeveloped territory to the west and south of Newtown, and thoughts returned to railways covering longer distances. A line striking across Wales from northeast to the southwest, possibly developing an Atlantic coast port, seemed attractive, and this led to several ambitious schemes. Other routes were considered, and one joining Newtown to Aberystwyth was considered attractive. Avoiding the mountainous area surrounding Plynlimon, the easiest and obvious route lay in a sweep north through Talerddig to Machynlleth, an important market town. A solicitor based there, named David Howell, made energetic moves to form a railway scheme, beginning with a public meeting on 20 December 1856 at Machynlleth. There was support for a railway, and the engineer Benjamin Piercy prepared plans for a route. A  line from the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway near Caersws to Machynlleth was shown to be feasible. It involved a climb from  to a summit of  at Talerddig with a maximum gradient of 1 in 71, and an even steeper descent to near sea level at Machynlleth with  at 1 in 52 to 1 in 60.C P Gasquoine, The Story of the Cambrian: A Biography of a Railway, 1922, reprint 1973, Christopher Davies (Publishers) Ltd, Llandybie, page 57"]}, {"page": "Marchwiel Hall", "response": ["Marchwiel Hall was a seat of the Broughton family and by 1837 was occupied by Townshend Mainwaring, who then moved to Galltfaenan Hall on his marriage.
