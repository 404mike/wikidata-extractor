His parents were of humble station, and he received a very elementary education but, being clever with his pencil, he was taken into service by Thomas Pennant about 1769. Pennant helped him to study drawing and engraving, and Griffith became his constant companion on his tours and excursions, making the drawings and engravings for Pennant's numerous works. Griffith became proficient both as a draughtsman and as an engraver.\nOn leaving Pennant's service he settled at Wibnant, near Holyhead, where he obtained plenty of employment as an engraver. He was alive in 1809, when he wrote a letter defending himself from an attack to the Gentleman's Magazine. Francis Grose employed Griffith to engrave some of the plates in his Antiquities.\nGriffith also painted watercolours of Welsh scenes, churches, country houses, and portraits, including two self-portraits.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
