Halford is most noted for his development and promotion of the dry fly technique on English chalk streams. He is generally accepted as \"The Father of Modern Dry Fly Fishing\". John Waller Hills, A History of Fly Fishing for Trout (1921) called Halford \"The Historian of the Dry Fly\".In Royal Coachman \u2013 The Lore and Legends of Fly Fishing (1999), Paul Schullery describes Halford:\n\n...highly formalized code of how a dry fly should be fished, a code further developed and popularized later in the nineteenth century by one of fly-fishing's most eminent authors, Frederic Halford, whose first book, Floating Flies and How to Dress Them, was published in 1886 and took the upper-crust world of British fly-fishing by storm.", "link_mentions": {}}}
