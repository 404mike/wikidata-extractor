During the war years, Horsley bought up many competing local dairies to become a major dairy force in the Humber region. In 1942, the business was registered as Northern Dairies and became a public company in 1956. In 1958, Alec's son Nicholas Horsley joined the then Northern Dairies as a trainee manager, becoming a director in 1963. His first great business success was to acquire, very cheaply, a stake in a small ice-cream company called Mr Whippy, which he sold on to Charles Forte for a very high price two years later.", "Nicholas Horsley took early retirement due to a rare genetic wasting disease, and by 1986, Haskins had become chairman of Northern Foods. In 1994, the Milk Marketing Board was abolished and milk prices in supermarkets fell. The loss of the high return on milk made a measurable impact on all dairy companies including Northern Foods. Northern Foods demerged Express Dairies in 1998 as the depressed margins were dragging the share price down of the overall group. Both businesses were listed to the FTSE 250. Express Dairies was later bought by in a staged acquisition, finalised in 2003, by Arla Amba a Danish and Swedish co-operative."]}, {"page": "Sebastian Horsley", "response": ["Horsley was born in Holderness in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
