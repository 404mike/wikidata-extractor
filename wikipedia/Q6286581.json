The only significant omission was Robin Hood and the Monk which would eventually be printed in 1806.

Under the title of Select Scottish Ballads he reprinted in 1783 his tragic ballads, with a supplement comprising Ballads of the Comic Kind. Joseph Ritson pointed out in 1784 that the so-called ancient ballads were some of them of modern date, and Pinkerton admitted that he was the author of the second part of Hardy Kanute and part-author of some others. He published an Essay on Medals in 1784, and in 1785, under the pseudonym of \"Robert Heron\", his bold but eccentric Letters of Literature depreciating the classical authors of Greece and Rome. In 1786 he edited Ancient Scottish Poems from the manuscript collections of Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington. It was succeeded in 1787 by a compilation, under the new pseudonym of \"H. Bennet\" entitled The Treasury of Wit, and by his first important historical work, the Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths, to which Gibbon acknowledged himself indebted.", "To this end he set his energy to collecting and creating older Anglo-Scottish literature. This was all the more important as far as his agenda was concerned because of the \"Celtomania\" produced by the Ossian poems of James Macpherson. Many such works had been invented by Pinkerton. His \"ancient\" Anglo-Scottish tale of Hardyknute had in fact only been composed in 1719 by Lady Wardlaw of Pitreavie.

Scott received congratulatory letters from delighted literary figures such as George Ellis, Anna Seward, and George Chalmers, and even from the notoriously prickly antiquaries John Pinkerton and Joseph Ritson.  Reviews of the Minstrelsy were also in general enthusiastic.  The Scots Magazine said that it would \"attract the attention of men of literature, not only in Scotland, but in every country which has preserved a taste for poetical antiquities, and popular poetry\".  It admired the notes, and ranked the work alongside Percy's Reliques.  The British Critic praised the \"taste and learning\" displayed in this \"elegant collection\".  The Edinburgh Review thought the Minstrelsy \"highly interesting and important to literature\", and found much to praise in Scott's notes, not to mention Ballantyne's printing.  Poetical merit, it judged, \"is here attained in a very eminent degree\", while warning that \"We are not...to view these poems as...highly-polished and elaborate specimens of art; but as exhibiting the true sparks and flashes of individual nature\".  Only the critic in the Monthly Review dissented.  He had little time for rude and unpolished Scottish ballads, protested that \"the taste of the age calls for models more correct and refined\", and lamented that \"it was decreed that Mr. Scott should publish these volumes, and that Reviewers should be doomed to read them\".
