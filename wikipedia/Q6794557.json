M. Barrett, was a university morbid anatomist and histologist at the University of Cambridge, and an honorary consulting pathologist to the United Cambridge Hospitals and to the East Anglian Regional Hospital Board. He wrote numerous works, often cited in medical literature.

That was a successful choice, even for the history of pathology: many students who had taken the Part II Pathology course would go on to occupy important positions in pathology and other branches of medicine (among them was Max Barrett). Dean was engaged to design a new building of the Department of Pathology in Tennis Court Road, where it is today from September 1928. In 1946 he improved his course (58 lectures) with a training scheme for the would-be pathologists (2 or 3 years of experience of laboratory work). Apart his own works, he guided others to their subsequent experimental works, as well as to their publications on immunology."]}, {"page": "Arthur Max Barrett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Max Barrett"]}]}}
