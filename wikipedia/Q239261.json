His stint in academia was even briefer than his time in Detroit, however. When he attempted to pack his course schedule with music, his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion, ethics, physical education, and military training. It was an institutional blunder that Benny Green described as being, in retrospect, \"comical,\" \"fatuous,\" and \"a parody.\"Green, p. 29. Beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes, and after he participated in a drunken incident in a local bar, he was expelled.Sudhalter and Evans, pp. 132\u2013133. According to Lion, he was not expelled, but quit (pp. 94\u201395). That summer he played with his friends Don Murray and Howdy Quicksell at a lake resort in Michigan. The band was run by Goldkette, and it put Beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before: the C-melody saxophone player Frankie Trumbauer. The two hit it off, both personally and musically, despite Trumbauer having been warned by other musicians: \"Look out, he's trouble. He drinks and you'll have a hard time handling him.\"Quotation from Trumbauer's journal; in Lion, p. 101. They were inseparable for much of the rest of Beiderbecke's career, with Trumbauer acting as something of a guardian to Beiderbecke.Brooks, p. 32 When Trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, Beiderbecke joined him. There he also played alongside the clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, who praised Beiderbecke's ability to drive the band. \"He more or less made you play whether you wanted to or not,\" Russell said. \"If you had any talent at all he made you play better.\"Lion, p. 104.", "Benny Green, in particular, derided Whiteman for being a mere \"mediocre vaudeville act\", and suggesting that \"today we only tolerate the horrors of Whiteman's recordings at all in the hope that here and there a Bixian fragment will redeem the mess.\"Green, p. 38; also quoted in Sudhalter, Lost Chords, p. 423. Richard Sudhalter has responded by suggesting that Beiderbecke saw the Whiteman band as an opportunity to pursue musical ambitions that did not stop at jazz:", "Beiderbecke's most famous solo was on \"Singin' the Blues\", recorded February 4, 1927. It has been hailed as an important example of the \"jazz ballad style\"\u2014\"a slow or medium-tempo piece played gently and sweetly, but not cloyingly, with no loss of muscle.\"Sudhalter and Evans, p. 196. The tune's laid-back emotions hinted at what would become, in the 1950s, the cool jazz style, personified by Chet Baker and Bill Evans. More than that, though, \"Singin' the Blues\" has been noted for the way its improvisations feel less improvised than composed, with each phrase building on the last in a logical fashion.

It opened on 17 May 1852 and was described by the musician and author Benny Green as being \"the most significant date in all the history of music hall\".Benny Green (ed) (1986) The Last Empires: A Music Hall Companion pp. 7 (Pavilion, 1986)  The hall looked like most contemporary pub concert rooms, but its replacement in 1854 was of then unprecedented size. It was further extended in 1859, later rebuilt as a variety theatre and finally destroyed by German bombing in 1942.Canterbury Music Hall (Arthur Lloyd) accessed 23 October 2007", "One of the most famous of these new palaces of pleasure in the West End was the Empire, Leicester Square, built as a theatre in 1884 but acquiring a music hall licence in 1887. Like the nearby Alhambra this theatre appealed to the men of leisure by featuring alluring ballet dancers and had a notorious promenade which was the resort of courtesans. Another spectacular example of the new variety theatre was the Tivoli in the Strand built 1888\u201390 in an eclectic neo-Romanesque style with Baroque and Moorish-Indian embellishments. \"The Tivoli\" became a brand name for music-halls all over the British Empire.Benny Green (1986) The Last Empires: A Music Hall Companion: 42-3 During 1892, the Royal English Opera House, which had been a financial failure in Shaftesbury Avenue, applied for a music hall licence and was converted by Walter Emden into a grand music hall and renamed the Palace Theatre of Varieties, managed by Charles Morton.Pages about Morton's management in feature on the theatre  (Arthur Lloyd) accessed 27 March 2008 Denied by the newly created LCC permission to construct the promenade, which was such a popular feature of the Empire and Alhambra, the Palace compensated in the way of adult entertainment by featuring apparently nude women in tableaux vivants, though the concerned LCC hastened to reassure patrons that the girls who featured in these displays were actually wearing flesh-toned body stockings and were not naked at all.Gavin Weightman (1992) Bright Lights, Big City: 94\u201395"]}, {"page": "The Diary of a Nobody", "response": ["During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, \"been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds\". An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady in which the protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that \"follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech\" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, \"burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class\".  The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978\u201381 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of \"Simon Crisp\", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in The Spectator, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is \"affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not\". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.
