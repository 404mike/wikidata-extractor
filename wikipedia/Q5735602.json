By this time he was the production supervisor at Beaconsfield Studios. Herbert was a great one for deleting his name from the credits. As Executive in charge of Production, many films he controlled while at Denham Studios went by uncredited, such as Henry V and Hamlet both with Laurence Olivier. There are many others not all mentioned here. In 1956 Herbert was called by Sidney Box who asked if he would make a movie about the new Rock 'n' Roll. What came out of this was The Tommy Steele Story, with great music by Lionel Bart \u2013 his first movie score. Herbert followed up with _6.5 Special (1958)_with all the pop stars of the period. His last film was Too Young to Love (1960) with Thomas Mitchell in 1960.\nHe was an assistant director on five films between 1930 and 1933, before the first 13 for which he was director (the last of them in 1940). He produced 69 films (including the majority of his director-credited films), for Denham Film Studios and British Lion Films from 1933 to 1963, including the war film They Were Not Divided in 1950.\nHe died on 4 February 1986 in Ramsgate, Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Lion Films", "response": ["British Lion was founded in November 1927 by Sam W. Smith (brother of Herbert Smith). By the end of the Second World War the company had released over 55 films, including In Which We Serve (1942), for which writer/producer No\u00ebl Coward received an Academy Award. It is best known for the period when it was managed by Sir Alexander Korda. Korda's company London Films bought the controlling interest in British Lion in 1946 and then acquired Shepperton Studios, basing its productions there. In 1949, due to financial problems, the company accepted a loan from the National Film Finance Corporation. Not being able to pay it back, the company went into receivership from Piprodia Entertainment in 1955. As a result, British Lion Films Ltd. was formed as a distribution company in January 1955, with the Boulting brothers, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat as directors. Until 1976 their distributor filmography included 155 films.https://www.imdb.com/company/co0105973/"]}, {"page": "Herbert Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["Herbert Smith is a law firm based in London.", "Herbert Smith may also refer to:", "*Herbert Smith (trade unionist) (1862\u20131938), British miners' union leader; subject of The Man in the Cap by Jack Lawson", "*Herbert Smith (politician) (1871\u20131935), Australian politician", "*Sir Herbert Smith, 1st Baronet (1872\u20131943), English carpet manufacturer", "*Herbert Smith (mineralogist) (1872\u20131953), British mineralogist", "*Herbert Smith (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u20131951), English international footballer, gold medallist in the 1908 Olympics", "*Herbert Smith (half-back), English footballer for Port Vale", "*Herbert Smith (forward), English footballer for Bradford City", "*Herbert Smith (aircraft designer) (1889\u20131977), British aircraft designer", "*Herbert Smith (producer) (1901\u20131986), British film producer and director", "*Herbert Smith (rugby league), English rugby league footballer of the 1920s for Great Britain, England, Bradford Northern, and Halifax", "*Herbert Smith (rugby league, born 1915) (1915\u2013?), English rugby league footballer of the 1930s and 1940s for Batley Shamrocks, Castleford, Bramley, Batley, and Bradford Northern", "*Herbert Smith (baseball), Negro league baseball player", "*Herbert Smith, regular on the BBC Radio comedy The Clitheroe Kid", "*Herbert Smith (art director) (1916\u20132006), production designer for the 1965 movie The Hill", "*Herbert Smith (businessman), British businessman in Hong Kong", "*G.
