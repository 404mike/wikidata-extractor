He taped virtually every show at the Forum from 1974 to 1980. Many of his recordings found their way into the hands of bootleggers who sold Millard's work to fans.\nStarting with a basic mono recorder in 1973, Millard upgraded to a Nakamichi 550 stereo recorder with AKG Acoustics 451E microphones for the 1975 Led Zeppelin shows in the area. He often used a wheelchair to conceal his equipment, pretending to be disabled.  Unlike most 1970s audience bootlegs, Millard's recordings are known for their good sound quality, and are to this day considered some of the finest audio bootlegs available.Millard's recording of the Led Zeppelin concert on June 21, 1977 at the Forum (allegedly taped from row number six) was released under the title Listen To This Eddie, and remains one of the best-known Led Zeppelin bootlegs.  His recording of the opening number from the concert, \"The Song Remains The Same\", was included in the promos menu of the Led Zeppelin DVD. Millard recorded four of the Rolling Stones five 1975 shows at the LA Forum, and his recording of the Sunday, July 13, 1975 show (titled 'LA Friday') has become one of the most widely spread recordings of a Rolling Stones concert.Millard was never behind the sale of bootlegs and was openly against the illegal sale of his recordings.  He was notorious for \"marking\" copies of his tapes so that if one of his recordings turned up for sale on LP or CD, he would be able to tell which person he had traded it to. He kept a very detailed logbook of his marked recordings and who they were distributed to. \"Unmarked\" copies of Millard's recordings are very scarce. In 2016 several unmarked first generation copies of his Led Zeppelin recordings surfaced in trading circles.Millard is said to have suffered from severe depression. He committed suicide in 1994.The Millard recording set-up was used by The National in 2019 to record two of their shows in Berkeley, CA, and an accompanying documentary titled Juicy Sonic Magic: The Mike Millard Method was also created.A 2021 Rolling Stone article  lauded the quality of his April 26, 1975 recording of Pink Floyd, going so far as to say, \"If Pink Floyd ever decides to create a Bootleg Series, they should get their hands on Millard\u2019s master tapes \u2014 starting with this 1975 Los Angeles gig. It\u2019s the band at the peak of their abilities as a live act and deserves to be heard as widely as possible.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings", "response": ["| Audience recording (taped by Mike Millard).", "| Audience recording.

However, whereas the \"Eddie\" bootleg featured a recording made by audience member Mike Millard, the recording that appeared on the original \"For Badgeholders Only\" vinyl bootleg was the work of an unknown taper. Millard did make his own recording of the June 23rd concert, but his tape did not appear until years later, when it was released on other bootlegs of the show. As with all bootlegs that have been made of Led Zeppelin concerts, these recordings were done in secret, and were issued illegally on vinyl and CD without the permission of the band."]}, {"page": "Millard (surname)", "response": ["*Mike Millard (died 1990), 1970s and '80s U.S. bootleg recorder"]}]}}
