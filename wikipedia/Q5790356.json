Amongst the other artists working there were Boudin and Francis Tattegrain, several more Irish, the English Dudley Hardy, the Americans Walter Gay and L. Birge Harrison, and the Australian Eleanor Ritchie, whom Harrison met there and married. While the rest were painting tranquil figures down at the harbour or in the woods, O'Meara describes Vail as \u2018painting the deck of a fishing boat in a heavy sea, life-size\u2019. This was \"Ready, About!\", which won a first-class gold medal in the Paris Salon of 1888. In the following decade, Vail's Norwegian associate Frits Thaulow was to spend some time in \u00c9taples while Andr\u00e9 Derain stopped there and in Montreuil-sur-mer during the summer of 1909.", "The only considerable English painter connected with \u00c9taples was Philip Wilson Steer, who spent some time there in 1887. His misty Impressionist style is striking in such paintings as \"The Beach\" (Gallery 4) and \"Fisher Children\". Another work for which he certainly made a preliminary study while there, \"The Bridge\", is now considered to have been painted in Walberswick, the English estuary town to which he next moved. Other painters are mainly of topographical interest. Dudley Hardy (1866\u20131922) captured an evening effect in a watercolour of 1888, looking from the south side of the Canche and showing the windmills that dominated the town at that period. Nora Cundell (1889-1948) takes us into the back parlour of the Cafe Loos, through the doorway of which one can see a few artist types at table."]}, {"page": "Thomas Bush Hardy", "response": ["Hardy had nine children.
