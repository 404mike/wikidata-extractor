He is a five-time All Star winner. He won All-Ireland Championships for Tyrone at minor level and three times at senior level, and captained Ireland in the International Rules Series.\nHis playing style was very attack-minded, considering he is usually deployed as a midfielder like the doc himself, and he usually ended up scoring more than most of the forwards on the team. This was complemented on the team by Brian Dooher's tireless workrate from the half-forward line \u2013 something he is the first to admit. 2008 was his most illustrious year as an individual. He won his third All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, captained Ireland to victory in the International Rules Series, and then won his fourth All Star award as well as Player of the Year.\nUpon retiring, Cavanagh held the all-time outfield appearances record in championship football, with 89 appearances for his county. He also made a record number of appearances for his county.His brother Colm has also played for Tyrone.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005 International Rules Series", "response": ["|| Heath Black || Fremantle || || Sean Cavanagh || Tyrone || "]}, {"page": "Ireland international rules football team", "response": ["*Sean Cavanagh (Tyrone)", "*Sean Cavanagh (Tyrone)", "*Sean Cavanagh (Tyrone)", "*Sean Cavanagh (Tyrone)", "*Sean Cavanagh (Tyrone)", "*Sean Cavanagh (Tyrone)", "| Sean Cavanagh (7 appearances)"]}, {"page": "Texaco Footballer of the Year", "response": ["| 2008 || Sean Cavanagh||Tyrone ||Moy  || Played at full forward"]}]}}
