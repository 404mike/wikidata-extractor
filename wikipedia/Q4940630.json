He was a right-handed tail-end batsman and off-break bowler who played in 302 first-class matches between 1951 and 1965, for Gloucestershire and Nottinghamshire. Wells took 998 wickets in first-class matches at an average of 24.26.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sam Cook (cricketer, born 1921)", "response": ["Cook took 139 wickets in 1950, but by this time Johnny Wardle, Malcolm Hilton and later Tony Lock \u2013 all far better batsmen and fielders were able to prevent him from having the slightest chance of returning to Test cricket.Selectors\u2019 fancies Owing to the loss of Goddard, Cook faltered a little between 1951 and 1955, but the very wet summer and dry spring of 1956 allowed him to form a devastating combination with Bomber Wells that led Cook to his best season ever with 149 wickets for less than fifteen runs apiece, including an amazing ten for 35 against Worcestershire and thirteen for 121 against Nottinghamshire. The following two seasons were moderate, but with the newly found spinning riches of John Mortimore and David Allen, Gloucestershire acquired the most formidable bowling attack in the country during the brilliant summer of 1959, with Cook \"making full use of his wealth of experience\". In this period Gloucestershire, as in the days of Parker, Goddard and Sinfield, often played three spinners, right up to the time when Cook retired in 1964. However, despite heading the first-class bowling averages for the only time in 1962, Cook's extreme weakness with the bat and in the field saw him left out of many matches even in that season and on grassier pitches the switch in emphasis to seam bowling made things even tougher for Cook as he grew older."]}, {"page": "Hartley Lobban", "response": ["In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets."]}, {"page": "1930 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Bomber Wells, cricketer (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "2008 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Bomber Wells, cricketer (born 1930)"]}, {"page": "Wells (name)", "response": ["* Bomber Wells (Bryan Douglas Wells, 1930\u20132008), English cricketer "]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2008", "response": ["*Bomber Wells, 77, British cricketer."]}, {"page": "Bryan Wells (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bomber Wells"]}, {"page": "Bryan Wells", "response": ["* Bomber Wells (Bryan Douglas Wells, 1930\u20132008), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Bryan Douglas Wells", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bomber Wells"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bomber Wells (1951\u20131959) : B.
