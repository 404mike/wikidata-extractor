He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks. He played club rugby for London Welsh and Newport RFC.\nHodges, along with fellow Welsh internationals George Boots, and later George Travers is recognised with adopting forward formation play in scrums and line outs. Although forwards were responsible for these areas of play there was little defined tactics or specialisation before the early twentieth century. Hodges helped bring tactical formations and therefore a level of specialisation to forward play. He was described as a hard working and an excellent all-round player who could fill in at most positions, even on the wing.", "link_mentions": {}}}
