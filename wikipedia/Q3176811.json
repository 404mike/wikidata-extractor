He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks. He played club rugby for London Welsh and Newport RFC.\nHodges, along with fellow Welsh internationals George Boots, and later George Travers is recognised with adopting forward formation play in scrums and line outs. Although forwards were responsible for these areas of play there was little defined tactics or specialisation before the early twentieth century. Hodges helped bring tactical formations and therefore a level of specialisation to forward play. He was described as a hard working and an excellent all-round player who could fill in at most positions, even on the wing.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newport RFC", "response": ["*  Jehoida

Pearson (rugby union, born 1872)", "response": ["Pearson gained his first cap for Wales while playing with Cardiff in 1891. His debut was against England on 3 January at Rodney Parade and Wales lost 7-3, though Pearson scored a try for Wales. This try made Pearson the youngest player to score a try for Wales at 18 years and 238 days until overtaken by Tom Prydie in 2010. Pearson's try also made him the youngest player to score a try on his Wales debut until George North surpassed the record in 2010. Pearson was dropped after the 1892 Championship and didn't regain his Wales place until the end of 1894 tournament, an unusual situation as during 1892/93 season, he scored a record 40 tries for Cardiff, a club record.Godwin (1984), pg 32. Pearson played fairly frequently for Wales through to 1898, but in 1903, with his international career supposedly far behind him, he was recalled to captain Wales against England. Pearson had already scored a try when he was forced to leave the field after a particularly heavy tackle from Harry Gamlin. His replacement, Jehoida Hodges scored a hat-trick of tries.

He made his d\u00e9but in an experienced team, with only George Travers of Pill Harriers earning his first cap alongside Jowett.

This ruled him out for the early games of the 1903 Home Nations Championship, and Rees was once again brought into the national team at threequarters. With injuries also sustained by Teddy Morgan and Willie Llewellyn, the Welsh threequarters was hastily constructed, with Swansea's Fred Jowett, and a recalled Tom Pearson taking the wings and Rees partnering the only surviving member of the 1902 team, Rhys Gabe. Despite losing their captain Pearson to a heavy tackle, the Welsh were rampant against a poor England in the opening match. Playing a man down, Jehoida Hodges was taken from the pack and placed on the wing to replace Pearson, and duly scored three tries in a 21\u20133 victory. Rees retained his partnership with Gabe for the next game of the tournament, played away at Inverlieth to Scotland. On a pitch which was waterlogged before kick-off and played under rain swept and windy conditions, Wales lost 6\u20130.

The match was played at Swansea's St. Helen's Ground against Ireland, and Jones took his place in the squad with fellow Llwynypia team-mates William Alexander and Willie Llewellyn.

Joining Walters in the pack were international debuts for Will Osborne, Will Joseph, Arthur Harding and Dai \"Tarw\" Jones. Adding to the unfamiliarity of the forwards was the fact that of the eight men, only Jehoida Hodges and George Boots played for the same club as each other. Under the captaincy of Gwyn Nicholls, the Welsh were victorious by a single point, thanks to a penalty goal from John Strand-Jones. Despite the win, Walters was the only member of the Welsh pack to lose his place for the next game, being replaced by Harry Jones of Penygraig.
