Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced in 1905, used a higher proportion of milk within the recipe compared with rival products. By 1914, the chocolate was the company's best-selling product.

In 1847, John Cadbury became a partner with his brother Benjamin and the company became known as \"Cadbury Brothers\".
