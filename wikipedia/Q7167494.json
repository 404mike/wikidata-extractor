Shortly afterwards he was selected as the candidate for Swansea West which had been won by the Conservatives by a narrow majority of 403 votes. The constituency, containing the city centre, the university and the relatively prosperous western suburbs, had historically been a marginal one for Labour, in contrast to the more working-class Swansea East. Percy Morris, elected in the Labour landslide of 1945 had seen his majority cut to just over a thousand votes in 1955 before he was ousted by the Conservative Hugh Rees four years later. Williams recaptured the seat in 1964, and held it for nearly 46 years. However, it was never entirely safe, and Rees made two unsuccessful attempts to recapture the seat in 1966 and in 1970. Wiliams had a very tight contest at the 1979 election, in the wake of the \"winter of discontent\" and divisions in the Welsh Labour Party over devolution. He held on by only 401 votes \u2013 only two less than the Tory majority he had overturned in 1964. His majorities thereafter were more secure but the fact that the Liberal Democrats came close to winning the seat after his retirement in 2010 suggests that he had a substantial personal vote."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Percy Morris"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Percy Morris"]}, {"page": "Swansea West (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Percy Morris", "* Labour: Percy Morris"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Percy Morris"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Percy Morris"]}, {"page": "List of people from Swansea", "response": ["*Percy Morris"]}, {"page": "1967 in Wales", "response": ["*7 March \u2013 Percy Morris, trade unionist and politician, 73"]}, {"page": "Swansea Guildhall", "response": ["The design envisaged a building finished in white Portland stone, and included a  art deco clock-tower, making it a landmark.
