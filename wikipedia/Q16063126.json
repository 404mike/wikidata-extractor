He and his brother also contributed illustrations to a collection of lectures by their sister Lucy Crane, a writer and scholar of art. In later years he returned to landscape painting, and some of his landscape work was exhibited in the Royal Academy.", "*Art and the Formation of Taste (1882) by Lucy Crane. Macmillan & Co."]}]}}
