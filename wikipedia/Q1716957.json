In 1959, 1961, 1963 and 1964 he won the British titles in all three walking events. He took part in the 1960 Olympics, but failed to finish the 20 km race. He won the same event at the 1964 Games in a new Olympic record of 1.29:34. He was the only one of the four gold medallists from Great Britain who did not receive an MBE soon afterwards in recognition of his achievement. Following a public outcry, he was belatedly appointed an MBE in 1977.Matthews also won the European title in 1962 and twice the Lugano Trophy (1961 and 1963).In 2007, he was the guest of honour at Hawarden High School for the Year 11 Record Of Achievement. In 2011, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.He died on 2 June 2019, aged 84.
