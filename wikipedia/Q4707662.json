The couple had produced National Geographic articles together from 1963 to 1971 on animals, Galapagos Islands, and mainly African wildlife. Notable films include: The Year of the Wildebeest (1974), Safari by Balloon (1975), Mysterious Castles of Clay (1978), Two in the Bush (1980) and A Season in the Sun (1983).Alan Root's strong narrative style characterised much of Survival\u2019s output and helped shape a sophisticated genre known as Blue Chip films.  The Year of the Wildebeest was the epic story of the thundering migration of wildebeest herds across the plains of the Serengeti. Mysterious Castles of Clay, by contrast, showed wildlife in intricate detail in and around termite mounds, revealing the insects' highly organised society and skills of construction. It received a nomination for an Academy Award.The Roots used a hot-air balloon to film sequences for the wildebeest film, and in Safari by Balloon made the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Kilimanjaro. Two in the Bush (re-titled Lights, Action, Africa! in the USA) included  \"Mysterious Castles Clay\" footage of a spitting cobra directing its venom at Joan's face positioned just a few feet from the snake while Alan filmed. A Season in the Sun, an account of wildlife's struggle to survive the heat and drought of the dry season, won an Emmy and a Peabody Award after it was aired by PBS in 1987.Alan and Joan Root were responsible for many of Survival's most successful films for almost 20 years from the mid-1960s.

Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers Joan and Alan Root. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas. After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans.

With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped Land Rover which she named \"Lily\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the Gombe Stream Research Centre to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees. Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the Virunga Mountains, Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier. Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp.

The first, Here Be Dragons was a spectacular account of the continent's biggest crocodiles ambushing migrating wildebeest at the Grumeti river in Tanzania. Its first screening on ITV was watched by over 11\u00a0million viewers. The seasonal variations that affect the Grumeti and the surrounding Serengeti plains were the focus of The Tides of Kirawira, a similarly dramatic exploration of the seasonal pools that dot the terrain, and the intricate survival techniques adopted by animals that depend on the shallows in the dry season, or on rains that swell the ponds into a vibrant waterland. A Little Fish in Deep Water was filmed in Lake Tanganyika, one of the world's biggest freshwater lakes, and focused on the cichlid family of fish and their varied behaviour and bizarre breeding methods, along with the wildlife that shares the crystal clear waters, from puffer fish to otters and crocodiles. The film was the Golden Panda Award winner at the Wildscreen Festival in 1996. In Mzima: Haunt of the River Horse, Deeble and Stone used the latest diving technology and developed new filming techniques to capture close-up footage of crocodiles and hippos. They also discovered an underwater hippo graveyard in a flooded cave system and witnessed the poignant infanticide of a tiny baby hippo that had been born in the pool. The film won an Emmy for music and sound design, as well as winning 10 \"best of festival\" prizes around the world."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2017", "response": ["*Alan Root, 80, British-born Kenyan filmmaker, glioblastoma.Renowned wildlife filmmaker Alan Root dies aged 80"]}, {"page": "List of female Academy Award winners and nominees for non-gendered categories", "response": ["|Shared with Alan Root."]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2017", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 26 || Alan Root || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 80 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| British || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Director || "]}, {"page": "List of Kenyan European people", "response": ["*Alan Root \u2013 conservationist, ecological activist and Oscar-nominated filmmaker"]}]}}
