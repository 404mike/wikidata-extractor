Murray's first game as manager, a day later at Field Mill, was a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. After a successful month as caretaker-manager, Murray was given the job on a permanent basis on 5 December, becoming the youngest manager in the top four divisions of English football. He made four free transfer signings in the January transfer window: defenders Junior Brown, Michael Raynes and Matty Blair, and midfielder Ricky Ravenhill. He sold Rob Taylor to Tranmere Rovers after the versatile player sought a move closer to his home. He also made use of the loan market, bringing in Billy Kee, Callum Elder, Lenny Pidgeley, Jeffrey Monakana, Adam Smith and Terry Hawkridge. Murray signed a new two-year contract in May.

Following a spate of injuries Adams signed Rangers and Northern Ireland utility player Andrew Little on a four-month loan. With 25 goals in the first six league games, Vale players found scoring goals easy, but the strength of the previous season \u2013 defending \u2013 seemed to have left them. In September, a brace from Rob Taylor and late winner from Pope were enough to beat Bradford City, as Vale climbed into the automatic promotion places. On 22 September 2011, Adams signed free agent Rob Kozluk on a short-term contract until 1 January 2012, and also brought in Liam Chilvers on a month's loan from Notts County (a loan deal later extended to 24 December); both players were signed to bolster Vale's struggling defence. The pair made their d\u00e9buts two days later, as Vale earned a 1\u20131 draw with local rivals Crewe Alexandra at the Alexandra Stadium \u2013 Pope finding an equaliser just two minutes after Byron Moore gave the \"Railwaymen\" the lead.", "In addition to off-the-field troubles in January, Adams also had to deal with an injury crisis to his small squad; already missing Ryan Burge and Lewis Haldane with long-term injuries, the treatment room also welcomed Marc Richards, Rob Taylor, Gareth Owen, Tom Pope and Lee Collins. Vale suffered four consecutive defeats, before managing to turn things around by the end of the month with 1\u20130 wins over Rotherham United and Plymouth Argyle. On 14 February, midfielders Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall joined the club on non-contract terms. However the treatment room grew more busy, as Adam Yates and Tom Pope picked up injuries requiring several weeks of rest. The club expected to receive a boost when Trinidad and Tobago international Chris Birchall returned from the Los Angeles Galaxy to play for the club on a month-by-month basis; however the club were hit by a transfer embargo by the Football League on 25 February for failing to pay a bill. Nevertheless performances on the pitch were solid, and Vale entered the Crewe derby having won four and drawn one of their last five games. The derby finished honours even again at 1\u20131, with a late header from Byron Moore cancelling out the own goal scored by Crewe skipper David Artell. A 2\u20131 home defeat by Barnet on 10 March ended Vale's run of eight game unbeaten; combined with a ten-point deduction for entering administration, the club slipped from 9th to 14th in the space of 24 hours. Promising young defender Lee Collins was the first the leave the club post-administration, joining Championship side Barnsley on a loan deal worth \u00a350,000 to the Vale on 15 March. The drama continued in the game against Shrewsbury Town on 27 March, as the match was abandoned after 64 minutes due to a fire caused by the failure of the floodlights at the New Meadow. With the season drawing to a close, Adams began developing his squad for the following season, and announced that he had 'reluctantly' released defender Charlie Raglan, without giving him his first team debut. He offered contracts to all but three players: Chris Martin, Phil Roe, and Paul Marshall; he also placed Burge on the transfer list. Aside from Lee Collins, the first player to reject a contract with Vale to move elsewhere was Anthony Griffith, who signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. The first out-of-contract players to pledge their futures to Port Vale were Rob Taylor (two years), Lewis Haldane (six months), Ben Williamson (one year), and Sam Johnson (one year). Days later it was announced that Sean Rigg had signed with Oxford United, whilst Clayton McDonald confirmed that he would accept Vale's offer of a new one-year deal. However the biggest blow to fan's hopes of promotion came when it was announced that talismanic top-scorer Marc Richards had signed a two-year deal with relegated League One side Chesterfield. June began with John McCombe and Tom Pope both agreeing to sign new deals with the club. The only player to reject the club's offer of a new contract despite not signing a contract elsewhere was goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson; he eventually ended up at Burton Albion.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||3||align=\"left\"| Rob Taylor", "|9||MF||||3||Rob Taylor||2||0||0||1||3", "|3||||MF||Rob Taylor||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The team got off to a solid start in August, recording wins over a poor Barnet side and a much more resilient Morecambe.

Having failed to hold down a first team place, especially with the tactical move away from wingers, Kaid Mohamed joined former club AFC Wimbledon on loan. They returned to form though in Burslem, recording a 3\u20131 victory over nearby Shrewsbury Town, and Adams said that the club had \"unearthed a gem\" after Hugill added Vale's third goal. The first big derby game against Crewe Alexandra came the following week, and the \"Railwaymen\" took the lead after 35 minutes only for Rob Taylor to mark his first appearance of the season by scoring the equalizing goal; Myrie-Williams scored the winning goal on 83 minutes which put Vale within one point of the play-offs whilst keeping Crewe second from bottom. However Vale fans were disappointed to see Preston North End win 2\u20130 at Vale Park despite playing with only ten men from the 12th minute of the game; it later transpired that the referee had sent off the wrong man, and that Neil Kilkenny was dismissed for striking Anthony Griffith when in fact the culprit was eventual double goalscorer Joe Garner. On 29 November goalkeeper Chris Neal injured his wrist and 21-year-old back-up 'keeper Sam Johnson was handed his league debut the following day away at Walsall.

His ban was later overturned and handed to Chris Lines, who had committed the tackle from behind which started the brawl in which Robertson had attempted to intervene as peacemaker. Vale went on to beat Walsall 1\u20130 with a controversial penalty and in doing so recorded their first double over Walsall in 114 years. Captain Loft and Dan Jones were ruled out of the Vale's next fixture after a training ground confrontation between the pair left Loft with a facial injury. Following a short investigation Jones was sacked by the club. This upheaval seemed not to affect the team as they went 2\u20130 up over Notts County at Meadow Lane, but then four goals without reply from County all but ended Vale's faint hopes of a play-off push. Vale then recorded their fourth straight home win after Jordan Hugill scored the only goal of the game against Milton Keynes Dons. A trip to third-place Rotherham ended with a 1\u20130 defeat, despite the hosts going down to ten men. In their final home game of the season, Vale let slip a one-goal lead to lose 2\u20131 to Sheffield United. The season ended with a 0\u20130 draw with Peterborough United at London Road. Three players were released in the summer: Anthony Griffith, Liam Chilvers and Rob Taylor, whilst Chris Shuker announced his retirement due to a chronic knee injury. Micky Adams elected to sign a new contract with the club, as did most of the club's out-of-contract players.

Promising forward Jordan Hugill also rejected a contract, and instead signed with Preston North End.
