She translated the German chorale tradition of church hymns for English speakers, for which she is recognized liturgically by The Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. She also worked for wider educational opportunities for girls, and translated biographies of two founders of religious sisterhoods.

The sheer number of these collections prevented any one of them from being successful. In 1861, members of the Oxford Movement published Hymns Ancient and Modern under the musical supervision of William Henry Monk, with 273 hymns.  For the first time, translations from languages other than Hebrew appeared, the \"Ancient\" in the title referring to the appearance of Phos Hilaron, translated from Greek by John Keble, and many hymns translated from Latin. This was a game-changer. The Hymns Ancient and Modern experienced immediate and overwhelming success. Total sales in 150 years were over 170 million copies. As such, it set the standard for many later hymnals on both sides of the Atlantic. English-speaking Lutherans in America began singing the metrical translations of German chorales by Catherine Winkworth and Jane Laurie Borthwick, and rediscovered their heritage. Although closely associated with the Church of England, Hymns Ancient and Modern was a private venture by a committee, called the Proprietors, chaired by Sir Henry Baker."]}, {"page": "1827 in literature", "response": ["*September 13 \u2013 Catherine Winkworth, English translator and hymnist (died 1878)"]}, {"page": "Joachim Neander", "response": ["Joachim Neander (Neumann)  (165031 May 1680) was a German Reformed (Calvinist) Church teacher, theologian and hymn writer whose most famous hymn, Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of Creation () has been described by John Julian in his A Dictionary of Hymnology \"a magnificent hymn of praise to God, perhaps the finest creation of its author, and of the first rank in its class.\" Due to its popularity it was translated several times into English - Catherine Winkworth being one of the translators in the 19th century - and the hymn has appeared in most major hymnals."]}, {"page": "William Sterndale Bennett", "response": ["Bennett edited some of the keyboard works of Beethoven and Handel and co-edited the Chorale Book for England with Otto Goldschmidt (1863), based on German hymns collected by Catherine Winkworth.
