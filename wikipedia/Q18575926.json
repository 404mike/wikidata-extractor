Her fellow students included William Coldstream, Rodrigo Moynihan and Anthony Devas, whom she married in 1931. Macnamara did well at the Slade and throughout the 1930s began establishing her career as an artist with works shown at the New English Art Club, the Royal Academy and the London Group. Shortly before the beginning of World War Two she had a one-woman show at the Storran Gallery. After the war Macnamara decided to concentrate on writing fiction. Her first novel, Bonfire was recommended for publication by Cecil Day Lewis and when it was eventually published, in 1958, it sold well and received good reviews including one by John Betjeman in the Daily Telegraph. Her most successful book was her autobiographical account of her unorthodox childhood, Two Flamboyant Fathers, which focused on both Augustus John and her own father. For several years Macnamara worked studying and sorting birds' eggs at the Natural History Museum.", "Anthony Devas died in 1958 and several years later Macnamara married Rupert Shephard, an artist and contemporary of hers from the Slade who was also a widower with three children. The couple set up home in Chelsea in a house which quickly became a social hub for many artists. Macnamara became an active member of both English PEN and PEN International and was a regular speaker at their events and conferences. In 1987 Macnamara's artwork featured in an exhibition of works by former Slade students held at Sally Hunter Fine Art.
