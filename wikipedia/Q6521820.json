Hodges rounded the back of the car and pulled it out slightly from the sides, a slot was cut out of the rear to house  the spare wheel and tyre which protruded out of the rear of the car and acted like a bumper. The car was a two-seater with a very light body but very little luggage space. It weighed only 2,100 pounds, which made it suitable for motor-sports."]}]}}
