Like the Middlesex county teams formed by earlier organisations from the early 18th century, the county club has always held first-class status.It has also run a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963;, as well as a top-class Twenty20 team since the inauguration of the Twenty20 Cup in 2003. These are three separate categories.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Middlesex player and then his name is given as it usually appears on match scorecards. Note that many players represented other top-class teams besides Middlesex and some players such as Nick Compton left the county but later returned. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club.The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only.\nPlayers who represented the county before 1864 are included if they also played for the county club but excluded if not. All players known to have represented the county before the formation of the county club are included in List of Middlesex county cricketers to 1863.", "link_mentions": {}}}
