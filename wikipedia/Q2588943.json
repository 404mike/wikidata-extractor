Because his character was English with a poor grasp of French, the actor, Arthur Bostrom, spoke perfectly in the English style but mangled his words when speaking in the French style. Bostrom therefore altered certain words in his sentences, substituting different vowels and/or consonants, changing them into different or nonsensical words, usually laden with innuendo. An example is the line \"I was passing by the door, and I thought I would drop in.\", which Bostrom pronounced \"I was pissing by the door, and I thought I would drip in\". Another example is Crabtree's greeting of \"good morning\", pronounced \"good moaning\".", "| Arthur Bostrom", "On 22 March 2007, a one-off special episode entitled The Return of 'Allo 'Allo! was filmed in Manchester, and was broadcast on 28 April 2007 at 9 pm on BBC 2.

Unfortunately, his French is weak and he is invariably unable to use the correct vowel sounds, which means that sometimes he is quite incomprehensible, most famously in his usual greeting \"Good moaning!\" (which he is even heard to use at night). Despite this, the Germans never seem to suspect him. To quote a notable example: \"I was pissing by the door when I heard two shats. You are holding in your hind a smoking goon. You are clearly the guilty potty!\" Another, during an air raid, is: \"They have had a direct hot on the pimps!\" \"The pimps?\" \"The pimps! The pimps in the pimping station! No water is being pimped down the poops!\" To repair the airmen's air balloon: \"You must get your hands on girl's knockers. At least farty, maybe fifty.\" And: \"I am mauving in a ginger fashion becerrs my poloceman's pints are full of dinamote!\" He then unbuttons his flies and slowly pulls out several large knockwurst in front of the watching caf\u00e9 patrons. After Crabtree is introduced in the series, Yvette frequently announces him as \"That idiot British officer who thinks he can speak French\". He says, \"I admit my Fronch cod be butter.\" Another example comes when Officer Crabtree mistakes Captain Alberto Bertorelli for a German officer, addressing him with a raised hand and: \"Hole Hotler!\" (as taken from script) instead of \"Heil Hitler!\" When Captain Bertorelli points out he is actually Italian, Officer Crabtree responds with: \"Hael Missuloni!\" instead of \"Hail Mussolini!\" When Flick and von Smallhausen (in disguise as \"vinkle\" salesmen) comment on his strange accent, he tells them he's from \"Nipples\" (Naples). When they can't understand the answer, he frustratingly states \"You know...See Nipples and do!\". There is additional \"explanation\" in S6E6 when Agent Grace, who appears to be Crabtree's girlfriend, explains that when they were both training, \"they trooned us to talk pish\", i.e. posh."]}]}}
