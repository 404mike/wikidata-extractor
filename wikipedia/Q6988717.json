An attacking left-handed batsman, sharp fielder and occasional off-spin bowler, Harvey was the senior batsman in the Australian team for much of the 1950s and was regarded by Wisden as the finest fielder of his era.

However, he was released by the club in November alongside defender Rory Coleman, with manager Steve Housham claiming \"they haven't lived up to expectations\". Later that month he turned out for Winterton Rangers of the Northern Counties East League Premier Division. He then signed for Matlock Town of the Northern Premier League Premier Division and made his debut on 3 December 2011 in a 2\u20132 draw away at Bradford Park Avenue, in which he was substituted after half an hour due to a hamstring injury. He then joined Conference North club Eastwood Town in early March 2012 but stayed less than a month, joining Northern Premier League Division One South club Brigg Town. He left soon after, re-signing for Frickley of the Northern Premier League Premier Division, a club he had played for earlier in his career, in late March 2012. His debut came on 24 March 2012 as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat at home Marine, and was sent off after nine minutes for a needless challenge on Neil Harvey. Shortly after that appearance, he was released by the club on 3 April 2012."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Cymru Premier players", "response": ["*Neil Harvey \u2013 Cefn Druids \u2013 2015"]}]}}
