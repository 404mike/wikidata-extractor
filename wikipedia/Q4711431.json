This was the first occasion on which a working-class team from the north of England had won the cup, which had previously been won solely by teams of wealthy amateurs from London and the south. At a civic reception upon the team's return to Blackburn, Warburton reportedly proclaimed \"The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London\".In the match report in the Blackburn Times on 6 April 1883, Warburton was described as a \"Master plumber; also pub landlord and poulterer\".

The scores remained level at the end of the regulation ninety minutes. Under the regulations of the FA Cup, thirty minutes of extra time could be played in the event of a draw, at the referee's discretion, and in response to the fervent mood of the crowd the captains asked to play on to try to secure a result.  During the extra period, Olympic's superior stamina began to show.  Around twenty minutes into extra time, Jimmy Costley received a pass from John Yates and kicked the ball past Etonian goalkeeper John Rawlinson to score the winning goal.Warsop, p. 139 Upon the team's return to Blackburn, the players took part in a celebratory parade and received a civic reception at which team captain Albert Warburton reportedly proclaimed \"The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire.
