This was the first occasion on which a working-class team from the north of England had won the cup, which had previously been won solely by teams of wealthy amateurs from London and the south. At a civic reception upon the team's return to Blackburn, Warburton reportedly proclaimed \"The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London\".In the match report in the Blackburn Times on 6 April 1883, Warburton was described as a \"Master plumber; also pub landlord and poulterer\". He was working as a publican at the time of the First World War.  He died on 24 November 1925.", "link_mentions": {}}}
