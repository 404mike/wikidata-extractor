Some evidence suggests that a paramyxovirus infection is the underlying cause of Paget's disease, which may support the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis.  However, no infectious virus has yet been isolated as a causative agent, and other evidence suggests an intrinsic hyperresponsive reaction to vitamin D and RANK ligand is the cause. Further research is therefore necessary.Basic Pathology, Kumar Abbas Fausto Mitchell, Saunders Elsevier", "The condition was initially described by Dr. James Paget. In a paper published in 1877, Paget told of five patients with \"a rare disease of bones\" which presented with slowly progressive bone deformities in the 4th and 5th decades of age. Strikingly, the first patient was described to have many of the classic complications of the disease, including arthritis related to abnormal bone mechanics, cranial nerve palsies associated with an enlarging skull, and malignant transformation of a tumor of the radius which ultimately proved fatal. Paget's post-mortem autopsy evaluation showed  \"bones of the vault of this skull were in every part increased to about four times the normal thickness,\" and microscopic evaluation showed evidence of both bone erosion and abnormal remodeling. Although he incorrectly attributed the findings to a process of chronic inflammation, having ruled out tumor and hypertrophy as alternative etiologies, these prescient observations of a mixed destructive/regenerative process correspond to the modern understanding of the disease."]}, {"page": "Paget's disease", "response": ["Paget's disease may refer to several conditions described by Sir James Paget, surgeon and pathologist:"]}, {"page": "Paget's disease of the breast", "response": ["Paget's disease of the breast is a type of cancer that outwardly may have the appearance of eczema, with skin changes involving the nipple of the breast.
