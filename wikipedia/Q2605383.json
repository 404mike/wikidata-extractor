(2 February 1745 \u2013 1 July 1813) was an English preacher and coalheaver. He is said to have preached that \"moral law\" is unnecessary, a theological view known as Antinomianism. Huntington was a strict Calvinist who believed some were predestined to be saved and some were not. He was also convinced that he would be identified as a true prophet on Judgement Day. His unusual, polemical style of preaching and writing made him popular but brought conflicts with other preachers throughout his life. He founded or opened chapels throughout England, many of which survive including Bethlehem Chapel, Richmond upon Thames.", "link_mentions": {}}}
