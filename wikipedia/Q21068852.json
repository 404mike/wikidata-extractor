Little is known about his childhood, we know only that he returned to London still as a child. He graduated around 1880, it is unknown exactly in which faculty he enrolled, probably a scientific one, because he was later a member of the \"Royal Society of Chemistry.\"\nIn 1891, aged 30, he decided to move to Bordighera where his maternal uncle Clarence Bicknell lived and he founded the \"Bank Berry\", located on the corner of the current Corso Italia and via Vittorio Emanuele. The bank prospered, but Berry decided to become an agent for the travel agency \"Thomas Cook's.\" In 1892 Edward created a service agency for the British residents, which took care of buying and selling homes, lease, freight or luggage, etc.\nIn 1897, Berry became vice-British Consul in Bordighera and the following year he married Margaret Serocold (1867-1957). Probably the two knew each other for a long time since Margaret had come for the first time in Bordighera already in 1886. The couple had no children and created a very profound relationship with Clarence Bicknell, much admired and appreciated by both.\nThe Berry collaborated and helped Bicknell in all its initiatives such as the creation of Bicknell Museum, the botanical and archaeological research on Mount Bego, the construction of the Fontanalba house etc. On the death of his uncle in 1918, the Berry spouses saved the museum from neglect. Their home, Villa Monte Verde, built in 1904, became the cultural core of Bordighera, as was Villa Rosa in the days of Bicknell. The Villa Monte Verde still exists and is located in Via Mostaccini, but unfortunately has been converted into an apartment building.\nEdward shared with his wife and his uncle a passion for history, traditions, art and architecture. In 1931, shortly after the death of Edward, Margaret published the book that she had prepared patiently with her husband, \"At the western gate of Italy\" which became a reference for all those who visited the west coast. Edward died suddenly in Rome, where he was buried in the Protestant cemetery in the city, and Margaret continued to live until 1935 in Bordighera. The advancing years and the arrival of fascism led to the sale of Villa Monte Verde and her move to Taplow, in the county of Buckinghamshire where lived her sister Caroline Packe. There she lived for another twenty-two years, and died in 1957 at the venerable age of 90.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bordighera", "response": ["* Edward Elhanan Berry (1861\u20131931) British diplomat."]}, {"page": "Edward Berry (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward Elhanan Berry (1861\u20131931), English diplomat"]}, {"page": "Clarence Bicknell", "response": ["In 1891, his 30-year-old nephew, Edward Elhanan Berry, moved to Bordighera for health reasons.

He immediately formed a special bond with this uncle whom he never knew before, and who passed on to him a passion for botany and history. Berry, who did much with his uncle for the creation of the museum, made many contributions to the collections gathered by Bicknell. In the building adjacent to the museum lies the International Institute of Ligurian Studies, where one can admire the original book published by Berry in 1931, At the western gate of Italy, which was long regarded as an essential text for anyone who wanted to study art and architecture of the Italian Riviera.Bordighera"]}, {"page": "Istituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri", "response": ["The creation of the International Institute of Ligurian Studies is credited to the partnership between Margaret Berry and Nino Lamboglia. In 1888, Clarence Bicknell built the Bicknell Museum at Via Romana 39, and when he died in 1918, he left the museum to the municipality of Bordighera, which planned to relocate it. Bicknell's grandson Edward Elhanan Berry, together with his wife Margaret, fought to keep the museum intact, and after five years, the municipality withdrew its plans to rehouse it. Thus, in 1924, the museum was transformed into an independent institution and its collections, at the time essentially linked to botany and prehistory, were expanded to include local art, history, and traditions."]}]}}
