It was written by Gareth Roberts and directed by Steve Hughes. It is a sequel to \"The Lodger\", an episode Roberts wrote for the previous series.\nIn the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) is going on a \"farewell tour\" before his impending death and visits his friend Craig Owens (James Corden) in present-day Colchester, who has a new baby son, Alfie. Though not initially intending to stay, the Doctor becomes intrigued by a Cybermen invasion at a local department store.\nRoberts and showrunner Steven Moffat wanted to bring Craig back, having enjoyed \"The Lodger\" and Corden's performance. Though \"Closing Time\" was designed to be fun, with comedy built around the double act of Smith and Corden, it contains themes and an epilogue that lead into the finale. The episode marks the first appearance of the Cybermats in the revival of Doctor Who, and they were appropriately redesigned. Much of the episode was filmed in a department store and a private home in Cardiff at night, with shooting going early into the morning. \"Closing Time\" was watched by 6.93 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics; while the performances, comedy, and emotional moments were praised, many critics were not pleased with the usage of the Cybermen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Companion (Doctor Who)", "response": ["Most companions travel in the TARDIS with the Doctor for more than one adventure. Sometimes a guest character takes a role in the story similar to that of a companion, such as photographer Isobel Watkins, who plays a significant role in The Invasion (1968), or Lynda in \"Bad Wolf\" and \"The Parting of the Ways\" (2005). In the revived era, some guest characters have gained companion status such as Mickey Smith, River Song, Wilfred Mott, and Craig Owens.", "! scope=\"row\"| Craig Owens "]}, {"page": "List of Doctor Who cast members", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" | Craig Owens"]}]}}
