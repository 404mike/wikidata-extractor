He was born in the former British colony of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia),\ngrew up in South Africa, and earned his PhD in Australia. Sutcliffe currently works at the University of Miami, and is of both British and Australian nationality.Geoff Sutcliffe is the developer of the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) problem library, and of the TPTP language for formal specification of Automated theorem proving problems and solutions. Since 1996 he has been organizing the annual CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), associated with the Conference on Automated Deduction and International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning. He has been a co-organizer of several Automated reasoning challenges, including the Modal Logic $100 Challenge, the MPTP $100 Challenges, and the SUMO $100 Challenges.:\u200a139\u200a Together with Stephan Schulz, Sutcliffe founded and has been organizing the ES* Workshop series, a venue for presentation and publishing of practically oriented Automated Reasoning research.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Association for Automated Reasoning", "response": ["The website of the association is maintained by Valentin Montmirail and Geoff Sutcliffe in Jekyll (software)."]}, {"page": "System on TPTP", "response": ["The system is maintained by Geoff Sutcliffe at the University of Miami. In November 2010, it featured more than 50 systems, including both theorem provers and model finders. System on TPTP can either run user-selected systems, or pick systems automatically based on problem features, and run them in parallel."]}, {"page": "Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning", "response": ["The LPAR steering committee consists of Matthias Baaz, Chris Ferm\u00fcller, Geoff Sutcliffe, and Andrei Voronkov (chair).LPAR Home page"]}]}}
