The Eclectic Society met fortnightly, initially at the Castle and Falcon Inn, and later in the vestry of St John's Chapel, Bedford Road, London.  At the outset in 1783, two of the founding clerics were relatively new in their Metropolitan incumbencies; Newton was four years established at St Mary Woolnorth (having moved from Olney), while Foster had held Long Acre for three years (having served as a lecturer in London since 1766).  Cecil held parishes in Sussex, but resided in Islington.  The society grew in influence as its membership both expanded and matured."]}]}}
