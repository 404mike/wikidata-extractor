In the Second World War he was General Officer Commanding Anti-Aircraft Command, one of the elements that protected Britain from aerial attack.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "V-2 rocket", "response": ["General Frederick Alfred Pile, commander of Anti-Aircraft Command, studied the problem and proposed that enough anti-aircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected."]}, {"page": "The Blitz", "response": ["On 14 October, the heaviest night attack to date saw 380 German bombers from  3 hit London. Around 200 people were killed and another 2,000 injured. British anti-aircraft defences (General Frederick Alfred Pile) fired 8,326 rounds and shot down only 2 bombers. On 15 October, the bombers returned and about 900 fires were started by the mix of  of high explosive and  of incendiaries dropped. Five main rail lines were cut in London and rolling stock damaged.Ray 1996, p. 131."]}, {"page": "RAF Bentley Priory", "response": ["In the Spring of 1940 Air Officer Commanding RAF Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, by then a widower, lived a very quiet domestic life with his sister Hilda at a house called Montrose (no longer standing) in Stanmore. He rarely went out socially and with an immense work load was happy to forgo all but duty functions. Every morning he would walk through the grounds to his office in the Priory. Dowding would often meet General Frederick Alfred Pile, who was the General Officer Commanding Anti-Aircraft Command, who was walking from his home, Glenthorn. The pair, who were firm friends, would use the time to talk about the war and other subjects. Dowding left visits to other stations in Fighter Command to his Staff Officers as he was much occupied with the work in his Priory office. However, he did pay regular night-time visits to research establishments and the air defences around London when The Blitz started in earnest in September 1940. These visits often followed periods of up to 48 hours at his desk leaving Dowding exhausted. Lord Beaverbrook and Winston Churchill made Dowding unwillingly relinquish command of Fighter Command on 24 November 1940 after he only approved some recommendations in a report to improve night air defences created by a committee of enquiry chaired by Sir John Salmond.", "On 1 April 1939, HQ Anti-Aircraft Command (AAC) was formed under General Alan Brooke, but on 28 July 1939, he was suddenly moved to command the British Forces and General Sir Frederick Alfred Pile took over. Anti-Aircraft Command then moved to 'Glenthorn', and the Gordon crest was adopted as the badge of Anti-Aircraft Command. This crest, the 'flexed bow and arrow', can still be seen on a silver bowl, presented to the mess when AAC closed, and is displayed in the Dowding Room. A Plotters School existed in one of the local houses where trainees used bicycles and megaphones to learn how to map incoming enemy aircraft."]}, {"page": "1976 in Ireland", "response": ["*14 November \u2013 Frederick Alfred Pile, soldier and politician (born 1884)."]}, {"page": "QF 3.7-inch AA gun", "response": ["The other used a travelling platform (Mounting Mk II) with detachable wheels for guns to be used in static positions but which could be re-positioned. The mounting had a pedestal that was fixed to a solidly constructed, preferably concrete, platform on the ground. In 1944, it was found that a temporary platform built from railway sleepers and rails was adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re-deploy without the cost and delay of constructing new concrete platforms. These were known as Pile platforms, after the head of Anti-Aircraft Command, General Frederick Alfred Pile.Dobinson, p. 436."]}, {"page": "Sir Frederick Pile", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Alfred Pile"]}, {"page": "Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)", "response": ["* Frederick Alfred Pile"]}, {"page": "1884 in Ireland", "response": ["*14 September \u2013 Frederick Alfred Pile, soldier and politician (died 1976)."]}, {"page": "Pile baronets", "response": ["*Sir Frederick Alfred Pile, 2nd Baronet (1884\u20131976) "]}, {"page": "Frederick Pile", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Alfred Pile"]}]}}
