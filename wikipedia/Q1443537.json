He served as Master of Christ's College, Cambridge from 2006 to 2016.\nKelly's research interests are in random processes, networks and optimisation, especially in very large-scale systems such as telecommunication or transportation networks. In the 1980s, he worked with colleagues in Cambridge and at British Telecom's Research Labs on Dynamic Alternative Routing in telephone networks, which was implemented in BT's main digital telephone network. He has also worked on the economic theory of pricing to congestion control and fair resource allocation in the internet. From 2003 to 2006 he served as Chief Scientific Advisor to the United Kingdom Department for Transport.\nKelly was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989. In December 2006 he was elected 37th Master of Christ's College, Cambridge. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to mathematical science.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John von Neumann Theory Prize", "response": ["* 2008 Frank Kelly"]}, {"page": "1950 in science", "response": ["* December 28 \u2013 Frank Kelly, British mathematician."]}, {"page": "Van Mildert College, Durham", "response": ["File:Professor Frank Kelly img 0103.jpg|Frank Kelly, academic, and former Master of Christ's College, Cambridge.", "* Frank Kelly \u2013 BSc (1971) \u2013 Professor of the Mathematics of Systems, University of Cambridge since 1990; Master of Christ's College, Cambridge from 2006 to 2016'KELLY, Prof. Francis Patrick, (Frank)', Who's Who 2013, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2013; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012; online edn, Nov 2012 accessed 5 April 2013"]}, {"page": "Routing in the PSTN", "response": ["An 1989 US patent by British Telecommunications describes dynamic alternative routing as:A call between two nodes interconnected by a direct link is first offered to the direct route, and if that is blocked it is offered to a currently nominated two-link alternative route between the two nodes. If that route is busy, the call is lost, and a randomly chosen two-link route is assigned to be the new current nominated alternative route.Thus the chosen route varies to take changing traffic patterns and demands into account. The technique was the subject of Richard Gibbens' doctoral thesis at Cambridge University under Frank Kelly, in collaboration with BT Research, and a British patent was granted in 1985.
