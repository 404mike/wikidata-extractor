She had been a frequent user of the narcotic for two years, having been introduced to heroin usage by her partner, Luke Fitzgerald, in 1998.Following Whitear's death, her parents authorized the publication of a police photograph of their daughter's slumped, flaccid and discoloured body as she was discovered clutching a syringe inside a rented bedsit approximately two days after her death. Her death and the publication of official police photographs of her body also led to a nationwide anti-drug campaign in Britain involving on a 22-minute documentary titled Rachel's Story which focuses upon her life, her potential, her struggles with heroin addiction, and ultimate overdose. The particular focus of the broadcasting of this documentary was nationwide secondary schools.The nationwide anti-drug campaign following Whitear's death has been compared to the anti-ecstasy campaigns undertaken after the 1995 deaths of English teenager Leah Betts and Australian schoolgirl Anna Wood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Death of Leah Betts", "response": ["* Rachel Whitear"]}, {"page": "Ledbury", "response": ["* Rachel Whitear, student."]}, {"page": "Saatchi Gallery", "response": ["*In 2004, media controversy arose over two paintings by Stella Vine.

Richard Dorment, The Daily Telegraph critic, described the work as \"another stab at creating the visual equivalent of tabloid journalism.\" Vine said she was upset that some people, including her relatives, didn't like her image of Diana, as she believed it was not a disrespectful picture but was in fact a self-portrait as much as a depiction of Diana: \"The picture is about two women. One who lived in Kensington Palace. And the other who lives down the Whitecross Street. 'I look at the picture,' says Vine, 'and I also see myself'\"."]}]}}
