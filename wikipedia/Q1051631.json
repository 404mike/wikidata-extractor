He is eleventh in the list of England's top-flight goal scorers with 243 league goals to his name. He was manager of Blackpool for 23 years and guided them to victory in the 1953 FA Cup Final, the only time they have won the competition since their 1887 inception.\nA forward, he began his career at Crewe Alexandra, but did not play a first team game for the club. He instead made his name at Bolton Wanderers, where with 277 league and cup goals between 1908 and 1927, he is the club's second highest goalscorer, only eight behind Nat Lofthouse. He won the Second Division title with Bolton 1908\u201309, and played in FA Cup final victories in 1923 and 1926. He later hit 61 goals in 70 league games for Stockport County, before being appointed player-manager at Darwen in 1929. Two years later he was appointed manager of Reading, and narrowly missed out on promotion during his four seasons in charge. He became Blackpool manager in August 1935, and remained in this position until April 1958. He led the \"Seasiders\" to one victory in three FA Cup final appearances (1948, 1951, and 1953), and also led the club to runners-up spot in the Second Division in 1936\u201337, second place in the First Division in 1955\u201356, and runners-up in the 1953 FA Charity Shield.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["Joseph or Joe Smith may also refer to:", "*Joe Smith (comedian) (1884\u20131981), American comedian", "*Joe Smith (musician) (1902\u20131937), American jazz trumpeter", "*Joe Smith (music industry executive) (1928\u20132019), American music industry executive", "*Joe Smith (Missouri politician) (born c. 1973), Republican member of the Missouri House of Representatives", "*Joe Smith (footballer, born 1886) (1886\u2013?), English footballer for Hull City, Everton and Bury", "*Joe Smith (football forward, born 1889) (1889\u20131971), England international footballer with Bolton Wanderers and manager of Blackpool", "*Joe Smith (football halfback, born 1889) (1889\u20131916), English footballer with Birmingham and Chesterfield, killed in action during the First World War", "*Joe Smith (footballer, born 1890) (1890\u20131956), England international footballer with West Bromwich Albion", "*Joe Smith (footballer, born 1908) (1908\u20131993), English footballer with Watford", "*Joe Smith (winger), English professional footballer with Burnley", "*Joe Smith (footballer, born 1953), Scottish footballer with Aberdeen", "*Joe Smith (American football coach) (1873\u20131923), American football player and coach", "*Joe Smith (running back) (born 1979), American professional gridiron football player", "*Joe Smith (1910s pitcher), American baseball player", "*Joe Smith (catcher) (1893\u20131974), American baseball catcher", "*Joe Smith (athlete) (1917\u20131993), American marathon runner", "*Joe Smith (basketball) (born 1975), American basketball player", "*Joe Smith (2010s pitcher) (born 1984), American baseball player", "*Joe Smith Jr. (born 1989), American boxer", "*Joe Smith (rugby union) (born 1991), South African rugby union player and powerlifter"]}, {"page": "Stanley Matthews", "response": [":\"You're 32, do you think you can make it for another couple of years?\" \u2013 Blackpool manager Joe Smith in 1947.", "After picking up an ankle injury in November, he missed most of the 1951\u201352 campaign, and was forced to instead spend most of his time working at the hotel he and his wife ran.

At this point new Stoke manager Frank Taylor enquired as to whether he might bring Matthews back to the club; all parties agreed to the idea in principle until Joe Smith put his foot down to ensure he stayed, with an inspirational speech he promised Matthews that an FA Cup winners medal was still possible, telling him that \"a lot of people think I'm mad, but even though you're 37, I believe your best football is still to come.\"", "Remaining a key first team member in 1956\u201357, injury restricted him to 25 league appearances, though Blackpool claimed a creditable fourth-place finish.
