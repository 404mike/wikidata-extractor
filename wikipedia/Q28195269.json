He is notable for his key role in developing live coding as a musical practice,\n including for creating TidalCycles, a live-coding environment that allows programmer musicians to code simply and quickly, and for coining the term Algorave with Nick Collins.He is an active and influential member of the live coding community; he is a co-founder of TOPLAP and joint leader of the Live Coding Research Network.\nAlex is co-founder of the Chordpunch record labelMcLean is also known for his work in software art, winning the Transmediale award for software art in 2002 for forkbomb.pl, a short Perl script which creates a unique image from an operating system under heavy load, and co-founding the runme.org software art repository with Olga Goriunova, Amy Alexander and Alexei Shulgin in 2003, which received an honorary mention in the Prix Ars Electronica netvision category in 2004.\nAlex McLean performs as a solo artist under the moniker Yaxu and is also a member of the live coding bands Slub and Canute. He has also collaborated with Kate Sicchio in combining live coding and live choreography.During 2016, McLean was sound artist in residence at the Open Data Institute, as part of the Sound and Music embedded programme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Comparison of free software for audio", "response": ["|Alex McLean et al"]}, {"page": "McLean", "response": ["* Alex McLean (born 1947), American photographic artist"]}, {"page": "Alexander McLean", "response": ["*Alex McLean, British musician and researcher"]}, {"page": "Slub (band)", "response": ["Slub is an algorave group formed in 2000 by Adrian Ward and Alex McLean, joined by Dave Griffiths in 2005 and Alexandra Cardenas in 2017.

Alex McLean of Slub and Nick Collins coined the word \"algorave\" in 2011, and the first event under such a name was organised in London, UK. It has since become a movement, with algoraves taking place around the world.", "Algorithmic approaches have long been applied in electronic dance music from the 1970s when Brian Eno established randomised musical practises which evolved into generative music over the course of his long career. This, in turn, influenced rave culture and techno of the 1990s by Farmers Manual, Autechre, and Aphex Twin. The Anti EP was an explicit response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 - specifically the track \"Flutter\" as a means of creating \"non-repetitive beats\" at raves which had been outlawed by the wording of the Act. The snare rush famously featured on the Girl/Boy EP of 1996 is an earlier form of digital algorithmic coding and featured in drum and bass influenced electronic music of the early to mid 1990s, this approach later evolving into glitch music. Traditional use of algorithms include Maypole dancing, where they are applied to the dance itself as a form of Algorithmic Choreography and bell-ringing. The first self-proclaimed \"algorave\" was held in London as a warmup concert for the SuperCollider Symposium 2012. However, the name was first coined in 2011, after live coders Nick Collins and Alex McLean tuned into a happy hardcore pirate radio station on the way to a performance in the UK. Since then, algorave has been growing into an international movement, with algoraves having been held mainly in Europe and Asia; and few events in Australia and North America."]}, {"page": "TidalCycles", "response": ["TidalCycles was created by Alex McLean who also coined the term Algorave."]}]}}
