The name Steeleye Span comes from a character in the traditional song \"Horkstow Grange\" (which they did not actually record until they released an album by that name in 1998). The song gives an account of a fight between John \"Steeleye\" Span and John Bowlin, neither of whom is proven to have been a real person. Martin Carthy gave Hart the idea to name the band after the song character.  When the band discussed names, they decided to choose among the three suggestions \"Middlemarch Wait\", \"Iyubidin's Wait\", and \"Steeleye Span\". Although there were only five members in the band, six ballots appeared and \"Steeleye Span\" won. Only in 1978 did Hart confess that he had voted twice. The liner notes for their first album include thanks to Carthy for the name suggestion.", "After a quiet spell, the group's 12th studio album (and first without Tim Hart) Back in Line was released on the Flutterby label in 1986. With no \"relaunch\" as such, the band retained a low profile, although they covered \"Blackleg Miner\" (a composition to support a 1844 strike revised many times by folk artists in the 20th century) to show solidarity with striking miners. Some argued this became a political anthem for the NUM during the miners' strike of 1984\u20135 and was used to intimidate working miners.  Steeleye Span continued to perform the song live and included a different version on their 1986 release Back in Line, which some claim puts greater stress on the line that threatens death against blacklegs .", "Founding member Tim Hart died on 24 December 2009, at his home in La Gomera on the Canary Islands, at the age of 61, after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, dulcimer, mandolin, vocals ", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, vocals", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, vocals", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, vocals", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, vocals", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, vocals", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, vocals", "* Tim Hart \u2013 guitars, vocals", "   bar:Hart         text:\"Tim Hart\""]}, {"page": "La Gomera", "response": ["*Tim Hart (1948\u20132009), English folk musician."]}, {"page": "Fiddler's Green", "response": ["* A song called \"Fiddler's Green\" or more often \"Fo'c'sle Song\", was written by John Conolly in 1966,When a Loose Cannon Flogs a Dead Horse There's the Devil to Pay: Seafaring Words in Everyday Speech by Olivia A.

The bringing in of manager Jo Lustig who pushed for a more commercial sound was probably what prompted the more traditionally minded Carthy and Hutchings to leave the band, which continued with changes of line-up and achieved considerable mainstream success.Hinton, B. and Wall, G.
