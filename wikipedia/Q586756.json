He was born in Belfast and returned there after spending some early years in Canada. After a few years working in the clothing industry, he worked at Short Brothers Ltd., an aircraft company based in Belfast, from 1965 until taking early retirement in 1984 as a result of diabetes. White married Margaret Sarah Martin, another science fiction fan, in 1955 and the couple had three children. He died of a stroke.\nHe became a fan of science fiction in 1941 and co-wrote two fan magazines, from 1948 to 1953 and 1952 to 1965. Encouraged by other fans, White began publishing short stories in 1953, and his first novel was published in 1957. His best-known novels were the twelve of the Sector General series, the first published in 1962 and the last after his death. White also published nine other novels, two of which were nominated for major awards, unsuccessfully.\nWhite abhorred violence, and medical and other emergencies were the sources of dramatic tension in his stories. The \"Sector General\" series is regarded as defining the genre of medical science fiction, and as introducing a memorable crew of aliens. Although missing winning the most prestigious honours four times, White gained other awards for specific works and for contributions to science fiction. He was also Guest-of-Honour of several conventions.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 7", "response": ["*  1928   \u2013 James White, Northern Irish author and educator (d. 1999)"]}, {"page": "List of Worldcons", "response": ["| James White (writer)Roger Corman (media)Elsie Wollheim (special)Takumi and Sachiko Shibano (fan)"]}, {"page": "1999", "response": ["* August 23 \u2013 James White, Irish writer (b. 1928)"]}, {"page": "Tractor beam", "response": ["* The Sector General books by James White The 1963 novel Star Surgeon is the source of the combined tractor/pressor beam weapon, the so-called \"Rattler\".

He learned of science fiction at about 11 years old when he read an A. E. van Vogt short story in an early edition of Astounding Science-Fiction magazine. During the Second World War American troops passed through Northern Ireland and often left their used SF magazines behind at Smithfield Market, where they were available for locals. He later described the experience as being more significant and long-lasting than taking LSD. He attended Belfast College of Technology. In 1950 he joined the group Irish Fandom, which also included another Northern Irish science fiction writer James White, and met at the house of Walt Willis on Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast. The group was influential in the early history of science fiction fandom and produced fanzines Hyphen and Slant, to both of which Shaw contributed material. Shaw acquired the nickname \"BoSh\" during this period. His first professional science fiction short story was published in 1954, followed by several others.", "Shaw was known in the fan community for his wit. Following his early membership of Irish Fandom, with Walt Willis, and James White, he always remained a keen reader of and contributor to fanzines. Later, and for many years, at the British science fiction convention Eastercon, he would deliver a humorous speech (often part of his famous series known by the tongue-in-cheek label of \"Serious Scientific Talks\"); these were eventually collected in The Eastercon Speeches (1979) and A Load of Old Bosh (1995), which included a similar talk from the 1979 Worldcon in Brighton, 37th World Science Fiction Convention. For these, he won the 1979 and 1980 Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer.
