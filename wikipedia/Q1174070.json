In 1989, they recorded Psalms, Motets and Concertos by Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, with the Knabenchor Hannover and singers Johanna Koslowsky, Mar\u00eda Cristina Kiehr, Heike Halaschka, David Cordier, Herbert Klein, Andreas Scholl, Wilfried Jochens, Gerd T\u00fcrk, Frans-Josef Selig and Stephan Schreckenberger. In 2000, they recorded early Bach cantatas, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12, the Actus Tragicus, Der Herr denket an uns, BWV 196, and Christ lag in Todesbanden, BWV 4, with singers Koslowsky, Elisabeth Popien, Jochens, T\u00fcrk and Schreckenberger. In 2002, they won the Gramophone Award in the category \"Baroque Vocal\" for the first complete recording of Monteverdi's Selva morale e spirituale, accompanied by the Concerto Palatino. Following the concept of Joshua Rifkin of one singer on a part, they recorded in 2003 Bach's Mass in B minor with ten singers, one on each part for the six-part and eight-part movements, but two on each part for most of the four-part and five-part movements.
