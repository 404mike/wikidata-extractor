Gwen's elder brother was Thornton John; her younger siblings were Augustus and Winifred.Langdale 1987 Edwin John was a solicitor whose dour temperament cast a chill over his family, and Augusta was often absent from the children owing to ill health, leaving her two sisters\u2014stern Salvationists\u2014to take her place in the household.Langdale 1987, p. 3. Augusta was an amateur watercolourist, and both parents encouraged the children's interest in literature and art.Langdale 1987, p. 4. Her mother died when Gwen was eight years of age. Regarding her mother's death and the loss of her influence, her brother, Augustus, later wrote: \"My mother would no doubt have been helpful, but she died when I was a small child, after, I fear, a very tearful existence.\"Tamboukou, p. 4.", "Following their mother's premature death in 1884, the family moved to Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales, where the early education of Gwen and her sister Winifred was provided by governesses.Langdale 1987, p. 5. The siblings often went to the coast of Tenby to sketch. John said that she would make \"rapid drawings of beached gulls, shells and fish on stray pieces of paper, or sometimes in the frontispiece of the book she was reading.\" Although she painted and drew from an early age, Gwen John's earliest surviving work dates from her nineteenth year.Langdale 1987, p. 7.", "She stopped exhibiting at the NEAC in 1911, but gained an important patron in John Quinn, an American art collector who, from 1910 until his death in 1924, purchased the majority of the works that Gwen John sold.Foster 1999, p. 26. Quinn's support freed John from having to work as a model, and enabled her to devote herself to her work. Although she participated in exhibitions fairly regularly, her perfectionism produced in her a marked ambivalence toward exhibiting. She wrote in 1911: \"I paint a good deal, but I don't often get a picture done\u2014that requires, for me, a very long time of a quiet mind, and never to think of exhibitions.\" In 1913, one of her paintings was included in the seminal Armory Show in New York, which Quinn assisted in organising.Quinn had sent John a telegram requesting \"Four (or three) Gwen John\"; her reply was \"One Gwen John\". Schwartz 2001, p. 37.", "Gwen John's art, in its quietude and its subtle colour relationships, stands in contrast to her brother's far more vivid and assertive work. Though she was once overshadowed by her popular brother, critical opinion now tends to view Gwen as the more talented of the two.  Augustus himself had predicted this reversal, saying \"In 50 years' time I will be known as the brother of Gwen John.\"", "An art mystery novel The Gwen John Sculpture, by John Malcolm, features her stay in Meudon, France and her relationship with Rodin.", "An S4C documentary presented by Ffion Hague about Gwen John's life included filming of the unveiling of a memorial plaque to the artist in Dieppe's Janval Cemetery in 2015.", "Margaret Forster wrote a novel, published 2006, Keeping the World Away, centred upon a picture by John, A Corner of the Artist's Room in Paris, which starts with the story of John herself and then follows stories of fictional women who subsequently owned it and responded to it.
