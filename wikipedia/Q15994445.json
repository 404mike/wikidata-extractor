Her interest in ornithology began due to her extensive birdwatching. She also began to study the plants in Jersey, leading her to meet T.W. Attenborough, a senior pharmacist who provided invaluable knowledge of Jersey's flora that later helped her career. She did most of her work at her local natural science society, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise. She was key to the ornithology section of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise, and also key to documenting various flora of the Jersey area in her book Flora of Jersey(1985). Along with her research work, Le Sueur worked hard for conservation of Jersey's flower population, campaigning to keep their flora alive to the planning authorities of the Jersey area.Her work made her an honorary member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise, and a study centre in Saint Ouen's Bay is named in her honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of female scientists in the 20th century", "response": ["* Frances Adams Le Sueur (1919\u20131995), British botanist and ornithologist"]}, {"page": "Frances Le Sueur", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frances Adams Le Sueur"]}]}}
