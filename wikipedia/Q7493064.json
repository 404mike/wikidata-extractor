After attending school in West Sussex and Kent, she taught English in Argentina after the death of her father in 1930. In 1935 she moved to England to stay with her sisters. Marrying Hal Foote, they moved to Mexico City in 1936 where she studied painting and drawing with Angelina Beloff, the first wife of Diego Rivera. Here, during the period of the Mexican art renaissance, she met Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco who admired her work and advised her: throw away your art books \u2013 just work. In 1938 they moved to Guatemala City; her marriage ended after 5 years and in 1940 she met archaeologist explorer Giles Healey whom she married in 1943, settling in Los Angeles before a further filming trip to Mexico. Encouraged by sculptor Henry Moore in New York in 1946, they moved westwards to Pacific Palisades and in 1947 she studied with both Rico Lebrun and William Brice in Los Angeles. After moving to West Sussex from Big Sur, California in 1970, she learnt that many of her paintings had been destroyed in a fire in Big Sur in 1971. During her time in Mexico and Big Sur, the Healeys' friendships with other artists are well documented; such as Lee Mullican, Luchita Hurtado, Kaffe Fassett, and Charles and Ray Eames.Sheila Healey's changing themes over 75 years have displayed continuity with both the portrait and with handling of colour, \"an essential human-ness being seen as a consistent thread through all her art.\"\nTextile artist and designer Kaffe Fassett opened the 2012 Exhibition with the following statement: Growing up barefoot in Big Sur, California, I first learned about colour from Sheila Healey; She is a great collector of colour. I think of her work as repeating pools of colour; that deep red palette that comes from South America. It's just so life-enhancing. It's blood red. It's the source of things. When I'm teaching my workshops I always say that what we're trying to do is make colour glow. That is what our task is. Make it come alive! Don't kill it! Don\u2019t make it drop dead! And this woman, whose show I'm so happy to be here for, makes colour glow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Giles Healey", "response": ["Meeting his future wife, artist Sheila HealeySheila Healey Retrospective: A Painters Journey, 20 Sept-2 Oct 1999; 27 Cork Street London Fonda  in 1940, they married in 1943, moved to Mexico in 1944 and he began a career as a Mayan archeologist, discovering 28 ruins. He was best known for the photography in 1946 of the pre-Columbian painted murals at the Maya site of Bonampak. He recorded his discoveries in still photographs and movie film, and produced the motion picture Maya Through the Ages, based on footage shot during the 10 years he spent in Guatemala and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Prior to the discovery of Bonampak's vivid murals dated to around AD 800, Mayanists had contended that the Classic Maya knew little of war and bloodshed and did not practice bloody sacrifices.Teotihuacan: Wonders of Man, Karl E.
