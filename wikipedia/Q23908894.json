Australia's first match of the tournament started in \"chaotic fashion\" at the coin toss when West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor called correctly and elected to bat before quickly changing her mind, only for Lanning to object. After much debate, match referee David Jukes adjudicated Taylor's first call had to stand. Following an eight-wicket defeat of the West Indies, Lanning shrugged off injury concerns with an innings of 152 not out from 135 balls against Sri Lanka. She would, however, go on to sit out of group stage matches against Pakistan and South Africa. At the conclusion of the tournament, from which Australia were eliminated via a 36-run semi-final loss to India, CA announced Lanning would undergo shoulder surgery that was expected to sideline her for six to eight months."]}, {"page": "2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier", "response": ["* David Jukes"]}, {"page": "2016 ICC World Cricket League Division Five", "response": ["*  David Jukes"]}, {"page": "2017 Women's Cricket World Cup", "response": ["The ICC announced a panel of thirteen umpires and three match referees to officiate the tournament, including four female umpires, the highest number yet for an ICC global event.
