The twelve-tone technique was also preceded by \"nondodecaphonic serial composition\" used independently in the works of Alexander Scriabin, Igor Stravinsky, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Carl Ruggles, and others.Perle 1977, 37. Oliver Neighbour argues that Bart\u00f3k was \"the first composer to use a group of twelve notes consciously for a structural purpose\", in 1908 with the third of his fourteen bagatelles.Neighbour 1955, 53. \"Essentially, Schoenberg and Hauer systematized and defined for their own dodecaphonic purposes a pervasive technical feature of 'modern' musical practice, the ostinato\".

She lived principally at Hambleden in Buckinghamshire, near to where Byrd and his brothers had a home. At some time it was presented to Queen Elizabeth by Sir Henry Neville, and then passed through various hands until it was given back in 1668 to an unknown Neville descendant. The book was preserved by the Neville family until the end of the eighteenth century, when it passed through several collectors' hands until it returned to the possession of William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny. In 2006 it was accepted by HM Government in lieu of Inheritance Tax, and allocated to the British Library. In 2009 the British Library digitised the manuscript and made it available as a virtual book on its website. It has also been published in facsimile.British Library MS Mus. 1591 with an introduction by Oliver Neighbour (Kassel, B\u00e4renreiter, 2012)"]}, {"page": "Nigel Fortune", "response": ["Nigel Cameron Fortune (5 December 1924 \u2013 10 April 2009) was an English musicologist and political activist. Along with Thurston Dart, Oliver Neighbour and Stanley Sadie he was one of Britain's leading musicologists of the post-World War II generation. He played an instrumental part in improving professional musicological standards in England through research initiatives, conferences and scholarly publications. This greatly increased his country's international reputation in the field of music scholarship."]}, {"page": "Neighbour, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Neighbour"]}]}}
