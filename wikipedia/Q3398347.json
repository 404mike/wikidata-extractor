According to tradition, it was founded by Pabo Post Prydain (Pabo the \"Pillar of Britain\"), a 5th-century prince from North Britain who was driven out in 460 and settled thereafter in Anglesey.

A stone slab gravestone dating from the late 14th century, made from Flintshire sandstone, was found in about 1680: according to the 17th-century Welsh historian Lewis Morris, it was unearthed by a sexton digging a grave in the churchyard. The rectangular slab (from the same workshop as one at Bangor Cathedral and one of St Iestyn at St Iestyn's Church, Llaniestyn, given the similarities between them) has a shallowly engraved full-length image of a bearded man wearing a crown and a loose, pleated tunic over a garment reaching to his wrists.  He holds a sceptre in his right hand; his head is on a cushion underneath an arch, and the background is decorated with flowers.  The effect is somewhat like a monumental brass in stone; the slab is now displayed vertically inside the church.  The inscription, which is incomplete, reads \"\" (or \"Prud\") \u2013 \"Here lies Pabo the Pillar of Britain\". Additional letters have been interpreted as denoting the name of the donor of the monument. Apart from this, the tradition linking Pabo to the church is not recorded in writing until the Welsh antiquarian Henry Rowlands in the 18th century, nor is there evidence that Pabo devoted himself to religion or died in Anglesey; accordingly, modern writers suggest that there is no link between him and the church.
