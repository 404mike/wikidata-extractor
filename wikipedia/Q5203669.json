Taylor, Orwell: The Life, Chatto & Windus, 2003, p. 174. Recent biographers, however, do not repeat this account. On 1 April 1936, Orwell rented a cottage in the remote village of Wallington, Hertfordshire, where he wrote The Road to Wigan Pier. Biographer Michael Shelden points out that the rental for the cottage was less than \u00a32 a month.Michael Shelden, Orwell:The Authorised Biography, Heinemann, 1991.", "Orwell, as well as living off the land, supplemented his income by running the cottage as the village store.

When it came to marrying, Orwell wrote to Gorer: \"I should never be economically justified in marrying, so might as well be unjustified now as later\".The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, Vol. 1, p. 222 (Penguin). D. J. Taylor argues that these factors, and the fact that Gollancz was not a person to part with such a sum on speculation, suggest that Gorer was confusing Orwell's eventual earnings from the book with a small contribution for out-of-pocket expenses that Gollancz might have given him."]}, {"page": "Angus Wilson", "response": ["* Evaluation by D.

It is sharp, funny and brilliant without suggesting that this sharpness, humour and brilliance is sufficient to carry through its purpose to any satisfactory conclusion. Yet it is a significant novel, if only because it provides an inventory of the hoops through which the contemporary novelist has to jump if he wants to be taken seriously\".

The result is that hardly anyone in these novels \u2014 brilliant novels, swimming with lively conceits \u2014 has that most necessary fictional quality, a life of their own\" and that \"A History is another of these newfangled romps, a series of neat, artfully stage-managed stories which combine to create a bizarre, off-centre view of world history\".
