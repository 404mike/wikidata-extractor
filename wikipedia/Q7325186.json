He top-scored with 22 not out from number eight in Worcestershire's painful first-innings progress to 79 all out in 55.4 overs, then took 0/49 with the ball; the game was drawn.He stayed in the side until the middle of June, playing along the way in his only List A game, a Gillette Cup quarter-final in which he made an important 30 from number nine,\nand making his only first-class half-century, 55* against Cambridge University; he also took his best innings figures of 3/44 in that game.\nbut then a paucity of wickets forced him back to the seconds. There, he still found it hard at first to take wickets, though he did score a couple of fifties.\nHowever, in July Devereux took ten wickets in the match against Kent II,\nand seven more wickets in the next match, against Essex II, propelled him back into the first team before the month was out. Not for long, however: once more he struggled to take wickets, and after he had taken none at all in three successive games against Essex, Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire he was back in the Second XI. This time there would be no return, and Devereux never again played senior cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Devereux", "response": ["Richard Devereux may refer to:", "* Richard Devereux (cricketer), English cricketer", "* Richard Devereux (died 1547), political figure during the reign of Henry VIII and Edward VI"]}]}}
