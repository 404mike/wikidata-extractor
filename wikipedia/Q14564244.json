Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), P\u00e2mella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In the early stages of the bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nord\u00e9n (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Mur\u00faa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Mur\u00faa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after being dropped earlier on in the race. In the final kilometre Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nord\u00e9n, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nord\u00e9n to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Mur\u00faa seventh and Jackson eighth.

Sherwood thought that if that there was a large group of athletes together on the run then many of the competitors would fancy their chances at winning.

Despite growing up in Australia Blatchford made the decision to race for the United Kingdom in 2004. This was done based on her desire to qualify for the 2004 Olympics and that the British women at the time were not as strong as the Australian women. Additionally, her coach, Brett Sutton, was not supported by Triathlon Australia. However, in her years of ITU racing she missed qualifying for three Olympics. Missing the 2012 Olympic cut was difficult for Blatchford as a younger, inexperienced Lucy Hall was chosen over her and Jodie Stimpson so that Hall could play a domestique role."]}, {"page": "ECS Triathlon", "response": ["|Mario Mola |||| Lucy Hall || "]}, {"page": "2014 in triathlon", "response": ["** Winner:  (Lucy Hall, Jonathan Brownlee, Vicky Holland, and Alistair Brownlee)Hamburg 2014 Mixed Relay WC Results"]}, {"page": "2017 in triathlon", "response": ["** Elite winners:  Richard Murray (m) /  Lucy Hall (f)"]}, {"page": "February 2017 in sports", "response": ["| Men:  Richard MurrayWomen:  Lucy Hall"]}, {"page": "Tom Bishop (triathlete)", "response": ["Throughout the next few years, Bishop recorded a number of high profile, top ten finishes as he worked his transitioned out of U23 racing and into Elite Men's.
