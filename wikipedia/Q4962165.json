Brett Findlay joined the band as resident percussionist and remained with the band until their break-up at the end of 1999. The release of Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts was preceded by the single \"Mystical Machine Gun\" which failed to make as strong an impact on the charts as their previous singles, peaking at Number 14 and only remaining two weeks in the top 40.
