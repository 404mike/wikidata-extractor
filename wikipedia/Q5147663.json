On the night of 24\u201325 September after composing a four-page letter of explanation and naming himself a \"victim of the Troubles\", Billy Giles hanged himself in his living room.Taylor, pp.9\u201311 He was 41 years old. Peter Taylor visited Giles' family in east Belfast on the eve of the funeral. He described Giles as lying in the coffin wearing his best suit, and his UVF badge with the inscribed words \"For God and Ulster\" was pinned to his lapel.Taylor, p.11 One of his last lines in his letter read, \"Please let the next generation live normal lives\".Taylor, p.11 This line was quoted during a speech given by Colm Cavanagh, vice-president of The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland on 3 March 2006 to The Department of Education. His friend and former UVF colleague Billy Mitchell, who was strongly critical of trauma counselling and a psychological approach to former paramilitaries, suggested that Giles' suicide had been prompted by a \"trauma workshop\" Giles had attended in South Africa. This was in contrast to Taylor, who believed that Giles took his own life because of the remorse he felt about his involvement in UVF violence."]}]}}
