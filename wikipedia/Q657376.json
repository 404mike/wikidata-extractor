It appears they had been put into a box and forgotten. On 5 October 1948, the keeper Bernard Ashmole received them in a box from Mr. G.A. Croker of Putney, who did not know what they were. After Doubleday's death, a fellow restorer from the British Museum took them to Mr. G.H. Gabb, a box maker, who was asked to make a box with thirty seven compartments, one for each fragment. However, the restorer also died and the box was never collected. After Gabb's death, his executrix, Miss Amy Reeves, brought in Croker to value Gabb's effects. This was how Crocker came to bring them to the museum to ask for help in identifying them."]}, {"page": "British School at Rome", "response": ["* Bernard Ashmole (1925\u20131928)"]}, {"page": "Forest School, Walthamstow", "response": ["** Bernard Ashmole, archaeologist and art historian"]}, {"page": "Emeline Hill Richardson", "response": ["Emeline Hurd Hill Richardson (June 6, 1910 in Buffalo, New York, USA \u2013 August 29, 1999 in Durham, North Carolina) was a notable classical archaeologist and Etruscan scholar.

Alternative views, since the flanking attendants stand on pebbled ground, have been offered: that the emerging figure is that of the ritual robing of a chthonic goddess, probably Persephone, rising from a cleft in the earthThis suggestion was first made in 1922 by Bernard Ashmole, in Journal of Hellenic Studies 42 pp. 248-53. (Pandora is similarly shown in Attic vase-paintings) or of Hera emerging reborn from the waters of Kanathos near Tiryns as Hera Parthenos.The comparison with roughly contemporaneous terracotta votive figures at Tiryns of Hera with a square cloth shielding her breasts, was noted by S.

Paul Getty Museum, Pacific Palisades, California. Many underwater bronzes have been discovered along the Aegean and Mediterrean coast; in 1900 sponge divers found the Antikythera Youth and the portrait head of a Stoic, at Antikythera, the standing Poseidon of Cape Artemision in 1926, the Croatian Apoxyomenos in 1996 and various bronzes until 1999.  The Victorious Youth was found in the summer of 1964 in the sea off Fano on the Adriatic coast of Italy, snagged in the nets of an Italian fishing trawler.  In the summer of 1977, The J. Paul Getty Museum purchased the bronze statue and it remains in the Getty Villa in Malibu, California.  Bernard Ashmole, an archaeologist and art historian, was asked to inspect the sculpture by a Munich art dealer Heinz Herzer; he and other scholars attributed it to Lysippos, a prolific sculptor of Classical Greek art. The research and conservation of the Victorious Youth dates from the 1980s to the 1990s, and is based on studies in classical bronzes, and ancient Mediterranean specialists collaboration with the Getty Museum. The entire sculpture was cast in one piece; this casting technique is called the \u201clost wax\u201d method; the sculpture was first created in clay with support to allow hot air to melt the wax creating a mold for molten bronze to be poured into, making a large bronze Victorious Youth.  More recently, scholars have been more concerned with the original social context, such as where the sculpture was made, for what context and who he might be.  Multiple interpretations of where the Youth was made and who the Youth is, are expressed in scholarly books by Jiri Frel, Paul Getty Museum curator, from 1973 to 1986, and Carol Mattusch, Professor of Art History at George Mason University specializing in Greek and Roman art with a focus in classical bronzes."]}, {"page": "Dionysus Sardanapalus", "response": ["The Dionysus Sardanapalus is an uncommon Hellenistic-Roman Neo Attic sculpture-type of the god Dionysus, misnamed after the king Sardanapalus.
