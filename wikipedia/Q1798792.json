The film features the first theatrical appearance of Alfred Molina as Jones' guide Satipo. Terry Richards portrays the Cairo swordsman shot by Jones.", "Spielberg said Ford was perfect for the role after seeing him in The Empire Strikes Back; Kanzanjian said Ford had always been considered but not cast because he was already a well-known actor. Lucas was concerned about seeming reliant on Ford by casting him in another film after Star Wars, and he also did not think he would commit to three films. However, Ford thought it would be a fun project and agreed to the deal. He negotiated a seven-figure salary, a percentage of the gross profits, and the option to re-write his dialogue. Ford undertook extensive exercise to enhance his physique and trained for several weeks under stunt coordinator Glenn Randall to use a bullwhip, becoming proficient enough to disarm the Monkey Man (Vic Tablian); his wrist had to be rehabilitated to compensate for an old injury. Ford's interpretation of the character was as an academic first and an adventurer second."]}, {"page": "1983 in film", "response": ["| Trenchcoat || Buena Vista Distribution || Michael Tuchner (director); Jeffrey Price, Peter S.

He appeared in the pilot episode, Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal, where Indiana Jones encounters Demetrios, while visiting an archeological dig in Egypt, in 1908. Demetrios murders a man, and steals an Egyptian jackal headpiece. Indiana encounters Demetrios (then known as \"Claw\", having lost one of his hands) again, while Indiana rides with Pancho Villa in 1916. Demetrios sells arms to Pancho Villa, while also selling information to General Pershing. Indiana confronts Demetrios, who is still in possession of the Jackal headpiece. Demetrios tries to kill Indiana, but is himself killed in an explosion, while Indiana gets away with the Jackal headpiece. Demetrios' encounters with Indiana Jones were later edited into the films My First Adventure and Spring Break Adventure.
