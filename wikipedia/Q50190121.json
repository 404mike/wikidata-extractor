She co-founded its first branch in London with Minnie Baldock. Kenney attracted the attention of the press and public in 1905 when she and Christabel Pankhurst were imprisoned for several days for assault and obstruction, after questioning Sir Edward Grey at a Liberal rally in Manchester on the issue of votes for women. The incident is credited with inaugurating a new phase in the struggle for women's suffrage in the UK, with the adoption of militant tactics. Annie had friendships with Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Baroness Pethick-Lawrence, Mary Blathwayt, Clara Codd, Adela Pankhurst and Christabel Pankhurst.", "Kenney and Minnie Baldock formed the first London branch of the WPSU in Canning Town in 1906, holding meetings at Canning Town Public Hall. In June that year Kenney, Adelaide Knight, and Mrs Sbarborough were arrested when they tried to obtain an audience with H. H. Asquith, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Offered the choice of six weeks in prison or giving up campaigning for one year, Kenney chose prison, as did the others. Kenney was invited to speak to working women's gatherings across the country throughout the campaign, including campaigning for a week in Liverpool at street meetings organised by Patricia Woodlock and Alice Morrissey."]}, {"page": "Dora Montefiore", "response": ["Montefiore was friends with suffragette Adelaide KnightAdelaide Knight, leader of the first east London suffragettes \u2014 East End Women's Museum and Minnie Baldock. Montefiore was one of the speaker's at Baldock's Canning Town WSPU group and wrote to support Baldock's 'noble stand' in visiting the Liberal leader in December 1906. Montefiore left the WSPU and joined the Adult Suffrage Society, for which she became honorary secretary in 1909, to support the case for full suffrage not based on financial status but for all men and women over the age of majority (21), rather than the limited option, some argued as a first step of women with property being enfranchised. Montefiore's socialist views were shared by Sylvia Pankhurst whom she kept in contact with after the split with WSPU."]}, {"page": "Nellie Martel", "response": ["On 3 October 1906, she was arrested, with Anne Cobden Sanderson, and Minnie Baldock at Parliament, and sentenced to two months in prison.

George Bernard Shaw wrote a letter of protest in September and she was released the following month. She was a founding member of the Women's Freedom League. She also helped form the Women's Tax Resistance League in 1909."]}, {"page": "Elsie Howey", "response": ["Howey joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a militant suffrage organisation, in 1907. In February 1908, she and her sister, Mary Gertrude Howey, were arrested alongside other WSPU members after hiding in a pantechnicon van that was driven into the House of Commons. After her release, she joined Annie Kenney and Mary Blathwayt to campaign at a by-election in Shropshire in May 1908. Soon afterwards, she was imprisoned again for three months for protesting outside the home of then-Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was sentenced to six weeks in jail. Her demonstrations became more daring, including hiding overnight in the organ at Colston Hall, Bristol before Augustine Birrell, MP  was due to speak, assisted by Vera Holme inside and Minnie Baldock.    She went further on 5 September 1910, when Howey and two other suffragettes, Vera Wentworth and Jessie Kenney, assaulted Prime Minister Asquith and Herbert Gladstone while the men were playing golf, and pursued Asquith to his holiday home, left protest cards, saying 'Release Patricia Woodlock' and other suffragette materials in his private garden. Howey's violent tactics were criticised by some other members of the WSPU who called for her removal from the union. The actions proved too much for Mary Blathwayt's family. Her mother, Emily, resigned from the WSPU and her father, Linley, wrote letters of protest to Christabel Pankhurst, Howey and Wentworth. Pankhurst was told that Howey and Wentworth could not visit their house again. Wentworth sent them a long reply expressing regret at their reaction but noting that \"if Mr. Asquith will not receive deputation they will pummel him again\"."]}, {"page": "Mary Phillips (suffragette)", "response": ["Phillips showed other suffragettes different forms of protest, including getting Charlie Marsh to help her pavement chalking in Lambeth, whom Philips noted  'gamely stood the jeering and rough handling' the women got in the process.  Her next location from January 1909, was in Newcastle and then back south to Cornwall and Devon.  She was among the welcoming party for another released prisoner Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, in April 1909, with the Pankhursts, two Kenney sisters, Vera Wentworth, Minnie Baldock and Mary Gawthorpe. They were taken to join 500 suffragettes at a celebration lunch at the Criterion, Picadilly Circus restaurant.  Phillips was arrested later in 1909 again with Vera Wentworth and Elsie Howie for attempting to force their attendance at a men's meeting in Exeter where Lord Carrington in charge of the Agriculture and Fisheries Board was speaking. During her seven days imprisoned she went on hunger strike and was released after four days 'in a dangerous state'. Other WSPU leaders Mary Blathwayt, Emily Blathwayt, wrote in their diaries about Phillips suffering from fainting, and Emmeline Pankhurst wrote to her \"my dear girl take care of yourself and do everything in your power to recover your health and strength.\"  Phillips also carried out  what Christabel Pankhurst called a 'splendid protest' showing ' pluck and ingenuity' by hiding under the stage overnight, jumping out shouting 'Votes for Women' and objecting to Patricia Woodlock's imprisonment when two Cabinet Ministers were being awarded honorary degrees in Liverpool St George's Hall."]}, {"page": "Daisy Parsons", "response": ["Parsons was inspired by Minnie Baldock in Canning Town and so she joined Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of Suffragettes and became the secretary of the branch in South West Ham. In 1914 Sylvia Pankhurst went on hunger strike and refused to stop until the Prime minister received women so that they could present their case for the vote. Asquith agreed and Parsons was able to tell him of her problems as she was one of the six women chosen including Jessie Payne, led by Mrs Julia Scurr. She told Asquith that she gave birth to children but she had little say in deciding \"what is good for them.\" During world war one the East London Federation of Suffragettes opened a baby clinic and Parsons was the manager. She was remembered as assertive and persuasive,"]}, {"page": "Adelaide Knight", "response": ["In 1905 Knight joined the Women's Social and Political Union and worked as secretary for the organisation's first East London branch in Canning Town, established by Annie Kenney and Minnie Baldock. She was co-opted onto the Central Committee of the WSPU, but resigned from the organisation in 1907 due to its lack of democracy, and having witnessed a false claim made by Christabel Pankhurst in order to promote enfranchisement for propertied women only.Langton page 119"]}]}}
