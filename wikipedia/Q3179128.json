At club level, he played in the Football League for Bradford (Park Avenue) and Portsmouth. He also played in two full international matches for Scotland.\nStephen signed for Bradford when he left school in 1938, and turned professional the following year. During the Second World War he made guest appearances for clubs including Halifax Town, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield Town. He left Bradford for Portsmouth in 1949, although National Service in the RAF meant he was restricted to a solitary appearance in the Portsmouth team that won the 1949\u201350 League title. He finished his career in non-league football with Yeovil Town.Having represented Scotland in five wartime internationals against England, Stephen made his full international debut as captain in the first competitive match Scotland played after the war, a 3\u20131 defeat to Wales on 19 October 1946 in the British Home Championship. His second and last cap came a year later, also against Wales.", "link_mentions": {}}}
