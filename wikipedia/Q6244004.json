His obituary in Wisden called him \"one of the best English cricketers of the 20th century never to play a Test match\".Born into a cricketing family at Newick, north of Lewes, John Langridge followed his elder brother James into the Sussex side in 1928 and stayed there until he retired in 1955. In between, he scored more than 34,000 runs as an opening batsman and made 76 centuries, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1950. Considered unlucky not to have earned a place in the national team, only Alan Jones of Glamorgan has scored more runs but not played for his country, and no one who scored as many centuries as Langridge failed to win international recognition. In addition, Langridge took 784 catches, mostly at slip, including 69 in his last season at the age of 45; only five players have taken more catches in a career or in a season.Langridge became a first-class umpire on retirement and stood in seven Test matches and eight One Day Internationals. He was appointed an MBE for services to cricket.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  John Langridge"]}, {"page": "John Arlott", "response": ["He was also invited in 1981 to select his Best XI from players who, for a wide variety of reasons, were never capped by England.

Unusually, though no longer captain, he returned to Oxford in 1933 for a fourth season and a fourth Blue and although he featured in fewer than half the University side's matches, he hit his highest Oxford score, an innings of 127 made in less than two-and-a-quarter hours against a very weak Surrey attack at The Oval. He played for Sussex again in the second half of the 1933 season and, as in the previous year, was not conspicuously successful \u2013 until, virtually at the end of the season, the West Indian touring team played Sussex. Facing a big West Indian total, Sussex, with Melville as stand-in captain, opened with Ted Bowley and John Langridge, and Manny Martindale and Herman Griffith were both bowling with aggressively and using leg theory, the tactic that had been used in the Bodyline controversy of the previous winter by England in Australia. Bowley was quickly hurt and retired; Melville came in and began hitting the bowling; Langridge was then also forced to retire hurt (he later returned to make 172), but Melville went on to 114 and a four-man first-wicket stand of 223.", "The reason Melville was captaining Sussex at the end of the 1933 season was that the regular captain Robert Scott, himself a stand-in for the permanently unwell K. S. Duleepsinhji, had stood down because of the death of his father; Scott was unable to resume in 1934, and Melville took over the Sussex captaincy for the next two seasons. Sussex had finished second in the County Championship for each of the preceding two seasons and under Melville in 1934 they again finished second, but there was veiled criticism of changes to the county's style of play in the 1935 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. \"Sussex, renowned for their attractive and enterprising hitting, developed a somewhat stodgy game in their efforts to finish at the top and they thus defeated their own ends,\" it said. \"At times they would not risk anything.\" Wisden compared Melville's \"strange disinclination to experiment\" with the adventurous approach taken by Maurice Tate, the senior professional at the club, who captained the side when Melville missed a few games. As a batsman, Melville was highly successful, scoring 1504 runs at an average of 42.97 with three centuries, though in the heady world of Sussex batting at the time that still left him only fifth in the county's batting averages, behind Tommy Cook, John Langridge, Jim Parks, Sr. and Harry Parks."]}, {"page": "Ted Bowley", "response": ["Bowley shared in several big partnerships for Sussex, two of them still county records. In 1921, he put on 385 for the second wicket with Maurice Tate against Northamptonshire at Northampton. Against Gloucestershire at Hove in 1929, he hit an undefeated 280 in a day and shared a first-wicket partnership of 368 with Jim Parks senior. This Sussex record was beaten four years later when, with John Langridge, he put on 490 runs. This is the third-highest first-wicket partnership in England, the fourth-highest of all time and the eighth-highest partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket. In this partnership, against Middlesex at Hove, Bowley made his highest score, 283."]}, {"page": "James Langridge", "response": ["Born in Newick, Sussex, Langridge was an all-rounder who played first-class cricket for almost thirty years. James Langridge \u2013 always called by his forename to distinguish him from his younger brother, Sussex opening batsman John Langridge \u2013 was a middle-order left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm spin bowler. Initially played by Sussex from 1924 as a batsman, he scored 1,000 runs in an English cricket season twenty times and finished with 31,716 runs and 42 centuries.

During this game the umpire Paul Gibb called the Derbyshire fast bowler Harold Rhodes six times for throwing, but Griffin remained unmolested. He took three wickets in his side's easy victory. In his next county game, against Essex, on 14\u201317 May, Griffin again escaped attention from the umpires, but members of the media, including the writer and former Test bowler Ian Peebles, wrote that \"there was something amiss\". The following week, in the match against the MCC at Lord's on 21\u201324 May, Griffin was called for throwing by both umpires, John Langridge and Frank Lee, the first member of any touring side to be thus called.  When, a few days later, he was called again in the match against Nottinghamshire, it was clear that some action needed to be taken."]}, {"page": "John Tunnicliffe", "response": ["Almost as important to Yorkshire as his batting was Tunnicliffe's slip fielding. Nicknamed \"Long John of Pudsey\", he had long arms that enabled him to bring off catches others would not have attempted. In 498 first-class matches, he took 695 catches. In a few of his early games in 1891 and 1892, he appeared to have acted as wicket-keeper, but thereafter he was at slip. His 70 catches in the 1901 season was a record that stood until Wally Hammond caught 79 in 1928. His ratio of catches to matches is 1.393:1, which compares favourably with both Hammond (1.291:1) and John Langridge (1.365:1)."]}, {"page": "Alan Jones (cricketer, born 1938)", "response": ["A product of local cricket near Swansea, Jones played first for Glamorgan in 1957.

Thereafter he was a fixture in the side until he retired at the end of the 1983 season, and his record of scoring 1,000 runs in 23 seasons has been beaten by only 10 other cricketers. His total career aggregate of 36,049 runs put him 35th on the all-time list of run-getters and is the highest of any player who did not play Test cricket. (Perhaps not coincidentally, his Glamorgan colleague Don Shepherd holds the record for taking the most first class wickets without playing a test match). His 56 centuries in first-class cricket is exceeded only by John Langridge among non-Test players. In addition to these first-class runs, he also scored more than 7,000 runs in List A matches.
