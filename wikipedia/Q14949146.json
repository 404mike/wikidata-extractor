In March 2015, they were Professor Dermot F McAleese, Professor John Scattergood, Mary Henry, Edward McParland, Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Sir Donnell Deeny. The chancellor and pro-chancellors are elected by the Senate. This is a function carried out without the intervention of the board, and so is entirely a university matter. This was not always the case, as the founding Charter of Queen Elizabeth I specified that successors to the first chancellor were to be elected by the Fellows, then when, later, the board of the college was established this power of election passed to it. The letters patent of Victoria as part of incorporating the Senate transferred the right of election to the Senate. The actual election procedures are set out in the university statutes. The current process is that when a vacancy for chancellor or pro chancellor occurs notice of this is sent by post to all members of the Senate who are invited to nominate candidates.  In the event of a contest a secret ballot of senators is held at a special convened meeting of the Senate."]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Sir Donnell Deeny"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*Sir Donnell Deeny (b. 1950)"]}, {"page": "Clongowes Wood College", "response": ["*Sir Donnell Deeny, judge in the High Court of Northern Ireland, Pro-Chancellor of the University of Dublin"]}, {"page": "Irish Times Debate", "response": ["|TCD Hist ||  Donnell Deeny || Gregory Murphy  || DIT Bolton Street || Marian Finucane ", "|TCD Hist ||  Donnell Deeny || Frank Bannister  || TCD Hist(St Mary's, Belfast) ||  Donnell Deeny(Kathleen Boyle)  "]}, {"page": "1981 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Donnell Deeny"]}, {"page": "High Sheriff of Belfast", "response": ["* 1983: Councillor Donnell Deeny"]}, {"page": "List of members of Middle Temple", "response": ["*Sir Donnell Deeny, Chancery Judge in the High Court of Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "Alan Moses", "response": ["He is joint Chair, together with Sir Donnell Deeny, of the Spoliation Advisory Panel.Spoliation Advisory Panel Chairs and members "]}, {"page": "Donnell", "response": ["*Donnell Deeny, QC, Chancery Judge in the High Court of Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "Spoliation Advisory Panel", "response": ["The Panel was established in February 2000 by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as an advisory non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).
