Bianca's friend Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) realises that Carl lied about knowing Alice and warns Alice and Bianca to be wary of him. Carl visits Ian, who denies knowing Derek. Carl realises Ian took \u00a310,000 from the box that Derek owed him, and Ian is terrified of Carl. The next day, Carl sees his ex-girlfriend, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), who says she is now married and pregnant, and he has no reason to stay. At the restaurant, Carl makes Ian confess to taking his money, and tells Ian to pay him \u00a3500 a week for the foreseeable future. He then tells Kirsty he is not leaving. Ian soon realises the situation between Carl and Kirsty, so he threatens to tell Kirsty about Carl's blackmail. Carl responds by burning Ian's hand."]}, {"page": "Jasmin Banks", "response": ["#REDIRECTJasmyn Banks"]}, {"page": "Quiz (TV series)", "response": ["* Jasmyn Banks as Nicola Howson"]}]}}
