In 1917, she published a paper in Folklore, the journal of the Folklore Society, in which she first articulated her version of the witch-cult theory, arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of \"a definite religion with beliefs, ritual, and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end\". She followed this up with papers on the subject in the journals Man and the Scottish Historical Review. She articulated these views more fully in her 1921 book The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, published by Oxford University Press after receiving a positive peer review by Henry Balfour, and which received both criticism and support on publication. Many reviews in academic journals were critical, with historians claiming that she had distorted and misinterpreted the contemporary records that she was using, but the book was nevertheless influential."]}, {"page": "1939", "response": ["* February 9 \u2013 Henry Balfour, British archaeologist (b. 1863)"]}, {"page": "St Benet's Hall, Oxford", "response": ["In 2015, St Benet's Hall acquired the villa and hall of residence owned by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart, at 11 Norham Gardens, next to University Parks and near Lady Margaret Hall in October 2015.

Museum staff are involved in teaching Archaeology and Anthropology at the University even today. The first Curator of the museum was Henry Balfour.  A second stipulation in the Deed of Gift was that a building should be provided to house the collection and used for no other purpose. The University therefore engaged Thomas Manly Deane, son of Thomas Newenham Deane who, together with Benjamin Woodward, had designed and built the original Oxford University Museum of Natural History building three decades earlier, to create an adjoining building at the rear of the main building to house the collection. Construction started in 1885 and was completed in 1886."]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Henry Balfour (1863\u20131939), British archaeologist, the first curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum and President of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland"]}]}}
