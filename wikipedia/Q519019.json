After the attack, Montalembert learned to cope with his despair and to go through life a new way, seeking to make ordinary things extraordinary. Defying expectation, this remarkable artist continued to travel the world alone, learning to navigate life in a new and beautiful way.

It launched with an advertising campaign that featured two opposing characters illustrating the nightmare of traditional life insurance and the simple, affordable alternative that Beagle Street provides. The characters featured in a series of TV spots before being discontinued in mid 2015.
