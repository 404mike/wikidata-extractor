Alfred spent many years in an orphanage with his sister, Edith, after his father died. He was considered very witty and musical throughout his life\u2014he sang and played the banjo\u2014but not considered very reliable or dependable. Although informally called Alf by his family, he released a record as Freddie Lennon, and was referred to in the media by that name.\nHe married Julia Stanley in 1938. John was their only child, but as Alfred was frequently away at sea during World War II, he did not see much of his child during his infancy. During this period Julia became pregnant with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. Alf had very little contact with his son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where he had gone to live after marrying Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.", "link_mentions": {}}}
