He was born in Shifnal, Shropshire, and he died at the age of 35 in East Worthing, Sussex.\nThree of Bennett's games were for Worcestershire in 1925, while the other came for the Civil Service (playing their only first-class match) in 1927. In the latter game against the touring New Zealanders, themselves making their first tour of England, he made 73 and 60 (by some distance the highest scores of his career).\nHe brought off only one catch in first-class cricket, to dismiss Bob Wyatt in the derby against Warwickshire.Before his brief first-class career, Bennett played a number of games in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire; he scored 97 for them against Kent Second XI in 1921.\nHe also played club cricket for Wolverhampton, and in a single-innings game against Shrewsbury School in 1922 hit 146 opening the batting; the match was eventually drawn with Shrewsbury nine wickets down.", "link_mentions": {}}}
