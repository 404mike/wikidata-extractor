In the latter game against the touring New Zealanders, themselves making their first tour of England, he made 73 and 60 (by some distance the highest scores of his career).\nHe brought off only one catch in first-class cricket, to dismiss Bob Wyatt in the derby against Warwickshire.Before his brief first-class career, Bennett played a number of games in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire; he scored 97 for them against Kent Second XI in 1921.\nHe also played club cricket for Wolverhampton, and in a single-innings game against Shrewsbury School in 1922 hit 146 opening the batting; the match was eventually drawn with Shrewsbury nine wickets down.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shifnal", "response": ["* Edwin Bennett (1893 in Shifnal \u2013 1929) an English cricketer, who played four first-class matches"]}, {"page": "Civil Service cricket team", "response": ["For the Civil Service, the best performer with the bat was Edwin Bennett, who hit 73 and 60, while the best bowling came from Allinson Chapman, playing his one and only first-class match, who claimed 3-73 from his 21 overs.
