In 1976 they created the character Morph who appeared as an animated side-kick to the TV presenter Tony Hart on his BBC TV programme Take Hart. The five-inch-high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called Plasticine. In 1977 they started on a series of animated films, again using modelling clay, but this time made for a more adult audience. The soundtrack for Down and Out was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue. A second film, also for the BBC followed in 1978. A TV series The Amazing Adventures of Morph was aired in 1980. They also produced a notable music video for \"Sledgehammer\", a song by Peter Gabriel."]}, {"page": "Wallace and Gromit", "response": ["| Nick Park, Claire Jennings, Peter Lord, Carla Shelley and David Sproxton", "| Nick Park, Peter Lord, Olivier Courson, Ron Halpern and David Sproxton", "| Nick Park, Peter Lord, David Sproxton, Richard Starzak, Mark Burton, Didier Lupfer and Ron Halpern"]}, {"page": "Aardman Animations", "response": ["Aardman was founded in 1972 as a low-budget project by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, who wanted to realise their dream of producing an animated motion picture.

After creating a segment called \"Greeblies\" (1975) using clay animation, became what was the inspiration for creating Morph, a simple clay character. Around the same time Lord and Sproxton made their first foray into adult animation with the shorts Down and Out and Confessions of a Foyer Girl, entries in the BBC's Animated Conversations series using real-life conversations as soundtracks.

A report on this exhibition was shown on Australian ABC News Breakfast on Wednesday, 28 June, featuring an 8-minute interview with producers Peter Lord and David Sproxton. The exhibition revealed that in Nick Park's very early sketches, Gromit was originally a cat, but Park soon changed him into a dog, since it was generally agreed that a dog was clearly more suitable as a loyal pet/companion than a cat and also because a dog would be easier to make and animate in Plasticine. Embedded in the ABC News article is a video interview with Lord and Sproxton, which gives information not only on Wallace and Gromit, but also Shaun the Sheep and others.", "On 9 November 2018, Aardman Animations announced that Peter Lord and David Sproxton would be transferring majority ownership of the company to its employees in order to keep the studio independent.

Unlike the claymation productions that the company are famous for, Aardman was cel-animated. Peter Lord has stated that the most interesting thing about the company name is that it \"means nothing\" and is only a joke that two teenagers found funny. He has stated that the name came from a combination of \"Aardvark\" and \"Superman\" for the reason that they found aardvark to be a particularly funny word. Aardman Animations became their company name when the BBC asked them who they should make their first cheque out to.
