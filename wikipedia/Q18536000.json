He had already written histories of Merthyr and Wales and won a gold medal for his writing at the 1881 National Eisteddfod. His bardic name was Catwg. Through The Red Dragon, Wilkins intended to reach a growing public literate in English but with little knowledge of Wales and \"to make known to the greater English world the characteristics and aims of the Welsh people and the beauties of their language and literature\"."]}, {"page": "Lucy Thomas", "response": ["Lucy Thomas (n\u00e9e Williams, baptised 11\u00a0March 1781\u00a0\u2013 27\u00a0September 1847) was a Welsh businesswoman and colliery owner known as the \"mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\". Thomas took over the running of her husband Robert's coal mine after his death in 1833. Unusual as it was at the time that a woman ran the business, more unusually she was also illiterate. Business documents held in the Glamorgan Archives show she signed only with an X. Much of Thomas' subsequent success as a businesswoman was embellished by Merthyr historian Charles Wilkins, who wrote one of the few articles on her life. It is now believed that George Insole, a Cardiff agent, was one of the chief architects of her success, though this does not diminish Thomas's position as one of the few women coal owners in industrial Britain. It is recorded that Lucy once attended the Coal Exchange in Cardiff only to be told she could not enter. She sent a male clerk in her employ into the Coal Exchange with a letter informing the establishment that \"My coal is equal to any mans, failure to grant entry will lead to my business lining another's pockets.\"", "Robert Thomas died in 1833. Lucy Thomas was granted letters of administration for the estate (having co-signed a surety bond with her son William and George Insole). From that time, Insole's payments for the coal dispatched were paid to her. Through Insole, a contract was written with Messrs Wood and Company to supply the London-based coal merchants with a quantity of 3,000 tons of coal per year. These early deals with the London markets helped establish the reputation of Welsh coal and were the basis on which Thomas became known as \"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\". Although Thomas was credited with these ventures, it is now believed that much of the success was due to Insole. The embellishment of Thomas's achievements are today attributed to Merthyr historian Charles Wilkins, who wrote an account of Thomas in 1888. Wilkins had a penchant for imaginative touches and his account gives the impression of Thomas as an enterprising woman who looked to set up new markets, whereas evidence now suggests that this work was conducted by her agents. Further research has also shown that coal had been shipped to London from Wales before either of the Thomases began extracting coal from their level, with shipments from Llanelli and Swansea being exported to the capital as early as 1824.
