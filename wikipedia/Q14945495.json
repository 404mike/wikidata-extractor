During his time at Balliol, he gained a reputation as a romantic\nhomosexual and aesthete, acquiring the nickname of the 'Balliol Bugger'. He had a controversial relationship with the essayist Walter Pater, for which he was sent down for nine months. In 1876, at the age of 21, he won the Newdigate Prize for his work Troy and recited his poem at the Sheldonian Theatre, June 21, 1876.
