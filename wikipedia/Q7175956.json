He made his first team debut for the club in a 1\u20130 victory over local rivals Hull City in the Football League Trophy in January 1998. He would have to wait another 18 months before he was called up for action again, and made a run out against Watford . Ben was used as the club's reserve left back and was understudy to Tony Gallimore, Chapman only managed 2 appearances in both the 1999-2000 and 2000\u20132001 season and would have to wait until the 2001-2002 campaign before he started to have a regular run in first team affairs. Notably that season Chapman played for Grimsby on both Anfield and Highbury as Grimsby recorded a historic cup win over Liverpool before being knocked out by Arsenal. In the Liverpool game, a Grimsby corner resulted in Chapman volleying just close over the crossbar and was Grimsby's only clear cut chance in the first half of play. He would go on to never get on the score sheet for the club. While playing for Grimsby, Chapman was responsible for ending the career of Scunthorpe United midfielder Peter Morrison during a pre season friendly in 2001. The game was abandoned as a result of the injury, and eventually following court proceedings, Morrison was rewarded a \u00a3400,000 compensation pay out."]}, {"page": "Peter Morrison (disambiguation)", "response": ["Peter Morrison (1944\u20131995) was a British Conservative politician", "Peter Morrison may also refer to:", "*Peter Morrison (Australian footballer) (born 1956), former Footscray and South Melbourne VFL footballer", "*Peter Morrison (English footballer) (born 1980), former Scunthorpe United association footballer", "*Peter Morrison (jurist), Australian magistrate", "*Peter Morrison (All Saints)", "*Peter Morrison (Labour politician)", "*Peter Morrison, pipe and whistle player of Peatbog Faeries"]}]}}
