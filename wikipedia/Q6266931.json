Houlston was Wales welterweight champion from 1938 until he relinquished the belt with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Houlston decision to join the Merchant Navy in 1939 resulted in him engaging in no professional bouts until he left the service in 1946. On his return to professional boxing after the war, Houlston switched to middleweight and made one unsuccessful attempt at the Welsh title. His boxing career lasted from 1935 to 1949. He was predicted to be a World Middleweight Champion before the war.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johnny Williams (boxer)", "response": ["|align=left| Johnny Houlston"]}, {"page": "Tommy Davies", "response": ["Davies' career after the Cerdan fight was chequered. From 1946 through to 1951, he successfully defended his Welsh Middleweight title on four occasions, showing that he was still the best Welsh fighter in his division. He stopped Taffy Williams in just four rounds in 1946, took a points decision over 15 rounds against Johnny Houlston in 1948, a win via technical knockout over Ron Cooper also in 1948 and a win against Des Jones in 1949. All his opponents, apart from Des Jones, would hold a Welsh title during their career. Other notable fighters during his final professional years included loses to two of the Turpin brothers; Dick Turpin stopped him in the fifth round in 1947 July, while Randy Turpin knocked Davies out in the second round three months earlier. Davies' final recorded fight was against South African Doug Miller on 19 February 1951."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Johnny Houlston"]}]}}
