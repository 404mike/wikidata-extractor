This upsets Roxy as Amy would be moving with them. Ronnie agrees to the move but tells Jack they cannot move without Roxy's consent. Roxy is disgusted when she hears of Jack's plan to sell the house she owns with Ronnie, but Jack promises that she will get half of the money they get. Roxy then agrees to let Ronnie and Jack move. However, when Roxy is reminded of Jack's old philandering ways, she becomes suspicious of him and Honey. She informs Ronnie, who confronts Jack. Furious, Jack declares that he and Ronnie cannot have a new life with Roxy being a part of it. Realising that Ronnie and Jack can give Amy the life she deserves, Roxy says that Ronnie and Jack can move to Ongar alone. Jack is surprised when Max returns to Walford. He questions his motives and tells him to stay away from his wedding but later makes peace with Max and allows him to attend. Jack and Ronnie visit James's grave and proceed to the wedding venue. Ronnie runs out and Jack is furious to find out that Ronnie has allowed Roxy to move to Ongar with them. However, realising Ronnie needs her sister, he accepts this. Jack and Ronnie marry. At the end of the night, Amy and Ricky ask him to read them a story, and while he is doing so, a drunk Ronnie and Roxy drown in the hotel swimming pool after Ronnie attempts to rescue Roxy but is weighed down by her wedding dress. The next day, Jack is informed of the deaths and is heartbroken. He insists he does not want the children to know, but Max tries to convince him that he should tell them. Jack's police liaison officer tells Jack that CCTV shows Ronnie going into the pool after Roxy, so Jack assumes this means that Roxy dragged Ronnie under. Jack and his devastated mother-in-law, Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber), identify the bodies. Later, when Amy and Ricky ask where Ronnie and Roxy are, Jack says that they have \"gone away\" and will never come back, leaving them confused. They question Jack and Max about Ronnie and Roxy, so Jack's stepmother, Dot Branning (June Brown), explains to them with sensitivity that they are \"God's angels\" and are watching them in heaven. Frustrated with everyone taking pity on him and struggling to cope with Ronnie's death, Jack announces that, after the funeral, he will move to Ongar with the children. Jack is informed by the liaison officer that the coroner's report reveals Roxy suffered a cardiac arrest in the pool from which he concludes that cocaine contributed to her death, so he blames her for Ronnie's death. After Ronnie and Roxy's funerals, Glenda tells Jack she intends to take custody of Matthew. Her son Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) tries to bribe Jack in return for changing her mind, but Jack beats him up. Glenda tells Jack she is not doing it for financial gain. Realising that Glenda is being sincere and that he needs help, Jack asks Glenda to move in with him. An inquest rules that Ronnie and Roxy's deaths were due to misadventure and drugs in Roxy's system did not contribute, but Jack still blames Roxy for Ronnie's death. Jack is angered when Glenda gets Amy's ears pierced and throws Glenda out but later realises her intentions were good and agrees to still let her be part of Amy, Ricky and Matthew's lives. He refuses to commemorate Roxy with a headstone but reconsiders when Stacey reminds him that it is only punishing her family and Amy."]}, {"page": "Whitney Dean", "response": ["Whitney discovers she is pregnant by Lee, but all her hints and attempts to tell him fail.
