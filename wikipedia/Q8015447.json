His political affiliations changed over the years from Liberal to National Liberal, back to Liberal and finally to Conservative, but he never wavered from a fierce loyalty to his native North East of England and was described in his obituary in The Times as one of the North East's leading figures, a keen publicist for the area and for Tyneside in particular.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlie Mitten", "response": ["In June 1958, Mitten left Mansfield and joined Newcastle United. Initially, he enjoyed success at the club and steered the club to a pair of solid mid-table finishes, despite an ongoing power struggle between chairman William McKeag (who had installed Mitten and gave him full control over the team) and director and former manager Stan Seymour (who felt the board should be able to veto Mitten's tactics and team selections). Newcastle gained a reputation for free-scoring football under Mitten, but they also proved to be defensively frail, and they ultimately paid the price for this in 1961, when they were relegated after a season in which they scored 86 goals but conceded 109. Mitten was allowed to remain in charge and attempt to steer the club back into the First Division, but instead they found themselves fighting relegation to the Third Division, eventually resulting in Mitten's dismissal a few months into the season. While at Newcastle, he was also involved in the George Eastham affair, which involved another player who challenged the authorities on player's rights."]}, {"page": "City of Durham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1931 || William McKeag ||Liberal"]}, {"page": "History of Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["|William McKeag"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William McKeag"]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* William McKeag, City of Durham, 1931\u201335"]}, {"page": "Stan Seymour", "response": ["In December 1954, Seymour stepped down from the manager's role and became the club's vice-chairman, appointing Doug Livingstone as the new manager. However, Seymour still believed that the manager's responsibilities should extend no further than training and motivating the players, something he demonstrated when Livingstone attempted to drop Jackie Milburn from the team for the 1955 FA Cup Final. Seymour responded to this by immediately relieving Livingstone of his ability to select the team, picking the eventual final team largely by himself, and saw Newcastle's victory in the final as vindication of his approach. By the end of the year Livingstone had been completely barred from working with the first team in any capacity, and his resignation near the start of 1956 allowed Seymour to fully take over the manager's role again. Newcastle's overall form deteriorated rapidly after this, though, and when the club only avoided relegation on goal average in 1958 it paved the way for chairman William McKeag (a bitter rival of Seymour's) to appoint Charlie Mitten as the new manager. Still, Seymour remained as part of the board until his death in 1978, and was appointed Life President of the club in 1976."]}, {"page": "Robert Bernays", "response": ["When the official Liberal Party (the 'Samuelites', so named after party leader Herbert Samuel) left the National Government, led by Ramsay MacDonald, over the tariffs-versus-Free Trade issue in November 1933, Bernays (along with three other followers of Samuel: Joseph Leckie, William McKeag, and Joseph Maclay) remained on the government benches, with the Liberal National Party MPs (or 'Simonites,' led by Sir John Simon), although Bernays himself, unlike Leckie and McKeag, did not yet openly become a 'Simonite.'  As early as July 1934, however, in a letter to Lucy Brereton, he was distinguishing himself from \"[t]he poor old Samuel Liberals\" and their \"frightful position\";Diaries and Letters p. 147 yet in December of the same year, writing to Lucy once more, he referred to the official Liberals as \"we\" and called Samuel his \"leader\";Diaries and Letters, p. 167 while in March 1935 he told his sister that he was \"very seriously thinking\" of \"asking for the government whip\".Diaries and Letters, p. 186 In short, he agonised about his party affiliation for some time. He was re-elected at the 1935 general election as a \"Liberal independent of all groups in the party\"Diaries and Letters, p. 259 \u2013 again without Conservative opposition, though with a drastically reduced majority (over Ayles) of 4,828 \u2013 and finally joined the Liberal Nationals in September 1936 (though he seems to have been in negotiations with them even before the 1935 election).Diaries and Letters, pp. 229\u201330 His decision to end his period of vacillation may have been motivated by a sense that he had burned his bridges with the official Liberals (no longer 'Samuelite', since Samuel had lost his seat in 1935 and the party was now led by Sir Archibald Sinclair), and that it would be hard for him to advance in his political career as an independent Liberal; while as a Liberal National he would be eligible for office in the National Government without having to go the whole hog and become a Conservative (an option which, many entries in his diaries suggest, would have been not only politically but also personally repugnant to him). It may also have been connected with the tragic death of his mother Lillian, who, after a long period of depressive illness and voluntary residence in nursing homes, was found dead in the River Thames just before Christmas 1935.  Bernays' sense that he needed to recover his psychological equilibrium and rebuild his career after his mother's death and the publicity it provoked is evident in his diary entries from early 1936.Diaries and Letters, p. 237 (A coroner's inquest recorded an open verdict on Mrs Bernays, but suicide must have been suspected, at a time when the stigma attached to it could still be seriously damaging to any relative of the victim who was a public figure in Britain.) Bernays's father remarried in 1937; Bernays acted as his best man.Diaries and Letters, p. 307."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. managers", "response": ["The late 1930s to mid 1950s were to be dominated by one man: Stan Seymour. Seymour played for Newcastle in the 1920s, and was often a crowd favourite. He left the club in acrimonious circumstances, but returned in 1938, as a director. Like Watt, he could not pick the team under the Director's Committee, but he had more influence on who could play (perhaps due to his stature). In 1947, he stepped down to allow George Martin to take over, but was back for a second spell in 1950 after Martin moved to Aston Villa, despite having steered the club to promotion and a series of strong First Division finishes. During Seymour's second spell, Newcastle won the FA Cup in consecutive years (1951 and 1952), and as a result, he became the first person in English football history to win the FA Cup with the same club as a player and manager. In 1954, Seymour would again step down to allow another man to take the helm, this time, it was Doug Livingstone. However, when the club reached the cup final in 1955, Livingstone attempted to drop Jackie Milburn, and Seymour, who was behind Milburn's successful trial, took affront to this and picked the cup final team by himself. Victory in the final meant for Seymour that he was right, and as a result, Livingstone was barred from any involvement with the first team, resigning the following year. Seymour took over for the third time, but in a cruel twist of fate, the club's form deteriorated rapidly under him, and they avoided relegation on goal difference. This was to be the final straw for chairman and boardroom rival William McKeag, and he appointed Charlie Mitten as Seymour's successor. He would remain on the board until his death in 1978. Despite a successful first few seasons in charge, Mitten's spell as manager culminated in Newcastle being relegated in 1961, and he was sacked later that year with the team struggling. Experienced trainer Norman Smith took over as manager for the remainder of the season and prevented a second consecutive relegation, but at 64 years old, Smith held no desire to occupy the manager's job on a long-term basis."]}, {"page": "Gordon McKeag", "response": ["McKeag was first appointed to the board of Newcastle United in November 1972 on the death of his father, Alderman William McKeag. In June 1988 he took on the top job as chairman at the club while he was in recovery from a quintuple heart bypass. He led the club through a difficult period when it was demoted to the old Division Two. During that time he fought off takeover bids from Sir John Hall. He stepped down from the job in December 1990 after a club share issue failed to gain support."]}, {"page": "McKeag, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam McKeag"]}, {"page": "McKeag", "response": ["*William McKeag (1897\u20131972), British politician, soldier and solicitor"]}, {"page": "List of Freemen of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne", "response": ["* William McKeag : December 1966."]}]}}
