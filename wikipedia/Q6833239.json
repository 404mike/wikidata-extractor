As a conscientious objector, rather than perform national service Oliver opted to work in a hospital, both in the mortuary and the kitchen. Later, as a member of CND, he was arrested during a demonstration, and for refusing to pay the fine spent some time in Brixton Prison.Before becoming a broadcaster, he pursued, as he put it, \"a dozen other trades and professions\" during the 1950s and 60s including selling radiators, and working for the Cambridge University Press while spending as much time as possible attending concerts. His other occupation was librarianship.Oliver presented BBC Radio 3's Music Weekly programme (1975\u201390), and also was a presenter of BBC Radio 4's Kaleidoscope (1974\u201387). The author of several books, including biographies of Igor Stravinsky and Benjamin Britten, he was also a regular contributor to The Gramophone, Classic CD, Classic Record Collector and BBC Music Magazine. He was also founding editor of International Opera Collector, a subsidiary of The Gramophone, started in 1996 but closed after only 13 issues, as a consequence of the sale of all the Gramophone magazines in July 1999.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Britten", "response": ["Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing and the maxim that \"you should find yourself and be true to what you found.\" The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the Quatre Chansons Fran\u00e7aises, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught; and  Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle."]}, {"page": "Alan Bush", "response": ["Notwithstanding the uncompromising nature of his politics, Bush in his writings tended to express his views in restrained terms, \"much more like a reforming patrician Whig than a proletarian revolutionary\" according to Michael Oliver in a 1995 Gramophone article.
