In her exploration of the subject, she also included studies on \"vaginal imagery,\" \"video pornography,\" and \"visibility and the female body.\" In her book, she discusses the history of the female nude and how to decide where to draw the line between pornography and art. She also talks about how traditionally, the female nude \"signifies the containment and disciplining of unruly female matter (and sexuality),\" and also, how in a Kantian fashion, women's bodies represent a challenge of converting a troublesome nature into \"pure art.\" Nead also discusses how feminist artists have resisted these traditions in various different ways.

Eventually, with support of Haringey Arts Council, he organised a flexible workshop and gallery called One Spirit Batik Centre in Wood Green specialising in working with young adults with disabilities who had English as the second language. Between 1990 and 1991, Merali organised solo exhibitions of Chila Kumari Burman and Tam Joseph, as well as group exhibitions by artists from Soweto, South Africa and print makers from Havana, Cuba. He was consequently invited to exhibit his own work at the University of West Indies, where his one-person exhibition was programmed alongside a concert by Don Cherry. In early 1989, Merali met the curators and the directors of the forthcoming 3rd Havana Biennale, including Geraldo Mosquera and Liliane Llanes. They implemented Merali's proposal of participation of five Black and Asian artists, living in Britain but coming from a global diaspora, to be included in what was, until then, the dedicated Southern World biennale. Returning from Cuba in 1988, Merali organised the works of the five artists, Sonia Boyce, Allan de Souza, Pitika Ntuli and Keith Piper alongside his own work to be exhibited in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, as well as at the Institute of Education, London.

He worked with artists from the Black British art movement of the 1980s, notably Sonia Boyce, Chila Kumari Burman and Lubaina Himid, and among his concerns has been the issue that only a small percentage of the Tate's collection of British art is on display at any one time, reflecting the personal taste of curators or trends of the time; as he has said: \"One of the factions of Britain which hasn't been very well represented until recently is the work of Black and Asian artists and that's one of the things that I really try to address in my work.\u201d"]}]}}
