Turner's biographer, Alfred Whitman, dismisses a tradition in the artist's family that he was apprenticed to George Jones, who was in fact younger than Turner, but suggests that he may have come under the influence of George Jones' father John Jones, who was a notable exponent both of mezzotint and stipple, without making any mention of any formal apprenticeship.Whitman 1907, p.4 In 1798 he was employed by the publisher Edward Orme to  produce the first plates for his \"transparencies\", a new type of varnished and coloured print designed to be illuminated from behind.Whitman 1907, p.5"]}, {"page": "John Masquerier", "response": ["#REDIRECT John James Masquerier"]}, {"page": "Mademoiselle Parisot", "response": ["In January 1799, a coloured mezzotint by Charles Turner after John James Masquerier was published which showed Parisot dancing, lightly clothed with a garland (illustration above).After John James Masquerier 1778\u20131855 Mademoiselle Parisot, Stipple engraving, 213 X 171 mm at racollection.org.uk, accessed 6 June 2012"]}, {"page": "Daniel Gardner", "response": ["In particular Gardner was well known as a pastellist. However, towards the end of the 18th century he started to paint in a technique that included oil paint, crayons, gouache and pastel. This technique was later copied by several other painters like John Downman, John James Masquerier and Peter Romney (1743\u20131777), the brother of George Romney. However, large paintings Gardner painted in oil only. These are rare and do not often appear on the art market. According to an original letter from Daniel Gardner, dated: London, 12 November 1779, and now preserved in the J. H. Anderdon Collection in the British Museum, Gardner painted his very first oil painting in 1779. Gardner speaks in this letter of an oil picture that he had just completed, as \"absolutely the first oil picture that I ever finished.\" The gentleman shown on this very first oil picture was Philip Egerton of Oulton (1738\u20131786), bareheaded, and holding a hoe in his hand.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works.
