The GWR was not immediately opposed to this, and the OW&WR may have understood that the GWR had formally agreed. The OW&WR Board improperly represented to prospective shareholders that the GWR guaranteed 4% interest on the whole construction cost whatever that might prove to be, and this led to soured relations between the two companies for a long period later on.

Charles John Wragge was an attorney who in 1835 became a partner in Rufford's Bank, Stourbridge with Francis Rufford, a railway financier, Member of Parliament, and speculator. In 1851 the bank suffered a liquidity crisis as a result of Rufford's speculations, and failed. All the assets were sold in 1852, including Red Hill House.
