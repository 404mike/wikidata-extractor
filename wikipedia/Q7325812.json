Called up to the Pontypridd senior squad towards the end of the 2002/03 season, he justified his promotion with an impressive tally of five touchdowns in five appearances.\nHaving cemented his place in the Pontypridd senior squad, Fussell's great promise was backed up by an invitation to train with the late Celtic Warriors regional team. Fussell went on to register 21 tries for Pontypridd in his 46 appearances for the club.\nFussell left Pontypridd in the 2005 close season to pursue a career with the Newport Gwent Dragons.
