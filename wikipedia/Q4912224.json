He made his Football League debut on 28 November 1908 in a 1\u20132 defeat at Oldham Athletic. He scored two in his second appearance (against Clapton Orient) and ended the season with 8 goals.\nThe 1909\u201310 campaign saw him score 27 goals, making him the club's top goalscorer for the season. During this, he became the first Wolves player to score two hat-tricks during a season and twice scored 4 in games. However, an injury in Autumn 1910 halted his exploits and effectively ended his Wolves career, though he managed one further appearance in February 1912.\nHe moved to Bristol Rovers in 1912 and died in 1962.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Billy Blunt"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wolverhampton", "response": ["* Billy Blunt (1886\u20131962) \u2013 footballer who played in the Football League for Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bristol Rovers; became the first Wolves player to score two hat-tricks during a season; twice he scored 4 in games"]}, {"page": "William Blunt (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Billy Blunt, footballer"]}]}}
