He was tied with Steve Davis at 8\u20138, but lost the match 11\u201318.\nGriffiths reached at least the quarter-finals of the World Championship for nine consecutive years from 1984 to 1992. He also won the Masters in 1980 and the UK Championship in 1982, making him one of the players to have completed snooker's Triple Crown. He was runner-up at the Masters three times, and reached the final of the 1989 European Open where he lost the deciding frame to John Parrott.\nAlthough he also won several other tournaments, Griffiths' determination to match his rival Davis led to him making changes in his playing technique that commentators have claimed meant that he lost his natural flair for playing. He announced his retirement from professional snooker in 1996 to become the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association's director of coaching, and developed a coaching career that has included working with leading players including Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams and Ding Junhui.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 16", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Terry Griffiths, Welsh snooker player and coach "]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Terry Griffiths (born 1947)"]}, {"page": "Wales", "response": ["In international cricket, Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team, or simply 'England'.
