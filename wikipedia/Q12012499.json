Many of these are owned by the Harlow Art Trust, an organisation set up in 1953 by the lead architect of Harlow Frederick Gibberd. Gibberd had idealistic notions of the New Town as a place where people who might not normally have access to art could enjoy great sculptures by great artists on every street corner. Consequently, almost all of Harlow's sculpture collection is in the open air, in shopping centres, housing estates and parks around the town.Whiteley, Gillian: Sculpture in Harlow, Harlow Art Trust, 2005"]}, {"page": "Ralph Brown (disambiguation)", "response": ["Ralph Brown (born 1957) is an English actor.", "Ralph Brown may also refer to:", "* Ralph Brown (sculptor) (1928\u20132013), British sculptor", "* Ralph Brown (cornerback) (born 1978), American football player", "* Ralph Brown (American football, born 1926) (1926\u20132016), American football player and coach", "* Ralph Brown (footballer) (born 1944), English footballer", "* Ralph Brown, American actor who appeared in the 1981 slasher film Final Exam", "* Ralph Browne, MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Ralph Brown, 85, sculptor."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2013", "response": ["*Ralph Brown, 85, British sculptor.Ralph Brown obituary"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| Ralph Brown   ||align=\"center\" |  1972  || "]}, {"page": "Winged Figure", "response": ["John Lewis originally approached Jacob Epstein to create a sculpture to decorate the plain Portland stone side wall of the new store, but he declined as he was engaged on other commissions.

These include, among others, the sculptors Ralph Brown, Anthony Caro (in his early work), Robert Clatworthy, Hubert Dalwood, Elisabeth Frink, George Fullard, John Hoskin and Leslie Thornton, and the painter John Berger. The post-War paintings of Francis Bacon and Graham Sutherland share some of the Atomic Age anxieties of the Geometry of Fear sculptors."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Ralph Brown (sculptor)"]}]}}
