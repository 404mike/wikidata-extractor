He was the deputy chairman and national organiser of the British National Party (BNP) and also prominent in the National Front (NF) during two spells of membership.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British National Party", "response": ["The BNP adheres to an ideology of ethnic nationalism. It promotes the idea that not all citizens of the United Kingdom belong to the British nation. Instead, it claims that the nation only belongs to \"the English, Scots, Irish and Welsh along with the limited numbers of peoples of European descent, who have arrived centuries or decades ago and who have fully integrated into our society\". This is a group that Griffin referred to as the \"home people\" or \"the folk\". According to Tyndall, \"The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism.\" Richard Edmonds in 1993 told The Guardian's Duncan Campbell that \"we [the BNP] are 100% racist\".Quoted in Gabriel, John Whitewash: Radicalized Politics and the Media, Routledge, 1998, p.158 The BNP does not regard UK citizens who are not ethnic white Europeans as \"British\", and party literature calls on supporters to avoid referring to such individuals as \"Black Britons\" or \"Asian Britons\", instead describing them as \"racial foreigners\".", "There is evidence to suggest that racially and religiously motivated crime increased in those areas where BNP councillors had been elected. For instance, after the 1993 election of Beackon, there was a spike in racist attacks in the borough of Tower Hamlets. BNP members were directly responsible for some of this; the party's national organiser Richard Edmonds was sentenced to three months imprisonment for his part in an attack on a black man and his white girlfriend.", "* Richard Edmonds, at the time BNP National Organiser, was sentenced to three months in prison in 1994 for his part in a racist attack. Edmonds threw a glass at the victim as he was walking past an East London pub where a group of BNP supporters was drinking. Others then 'glassed' the man in the face and punched and kicked him as he lay on the ground, including BNP supporter Stephen O'Shea, who was jailed for 12 months. Another BNP supporter, Simon Biggs, was jailed for four and a half years for his part in the attack."]}, {"page": "Derek Beackon", "response": ["Despite this support Beackon remained a peripheral figure within the BNP under Griffin's leadership and before long he fell in with the group of anti-Griffin activists around Tyndall. His eulogy to Tyndall was one of the few written by an active BNP member to appear in the final issue of Spearhead, released immediately following Tyndall's death.Spearhead, Number 438, August 2005, p. 4 Still nominally a member of the BNP he has become associated with the 'Friends of John Tyndall', an informal anti-Griffin group largely controlled by Richard Edmonds and John Morse in attending a speech by Valerie Tyndall which they had organised in July 2007. The event included stalls by a number of political parties \u2013 the National Front, England First Party and the British People's Party. The BNP did not participate.Searchlight, August 2007, p. 14"]}]}}
