He was a producer and director for the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, and also worked as an actor.\nHe made his name as a producer and director on productions such as Angels, Compact and Z-Cars; but his most impressive credit was perhaps as producer of the highly popular dramatisation of Poldark by Winston Graham.Morris Barry had a strong connection with Doctor Who as well. He directed three stories during the Patrick Troughton years: The Moonbase (1967), The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967) and The Dominators (1968). He was known by the cast and crew of Doctor Who to be a somewhat strict and uncompromising director of the old school, but The Moonbase and The Tomb of the Cybermen are often spoken of as classics of 1960s Doctor Who. He was also well known for carrying a music stand to place his script on during rehearsals.He also appeared as an actor in the Doctor Who story The Creature from the Pit in 1979, playing the scientist Tollund. His other acting credits include episodes of Are You Being Served?, Blake's 7, The Day of the Triffids, Tales of the Unexpected, All Creatures Great and Small, and Hi-de-Hi!.Morris Barry died in 2000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)", "response": ["A number of actors appeared in supporting roles in most episodes: in series 1 these included: Victor Woolf, Willoughby Gray, and John Longden, and for later series included: Paul Hansard, Morris Barry, Nigel Davenport, Kevin Stoney, Ronald Hines, and Max Faulkner, who also did stunt/double work. Frank Maher (later Patrick McGoohan's stunt double) played many small non-speaking parts, and stuntman Terry Yorke, who doubled for Richard Greene, played many small roles throughout all four series. In Series 3, Paul Eddington played a different character in many episodes, before settling down to Will Scarlett."]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Morris Barry"]}, {"page": "The Tomb of the Cybermen", "response": ["In the scene where the group are at the main entrance of the tomb, Patrick Troughton and Frazer Hines worked out in secret, without the knowledge of director Morris Barry, the brief sequence where both the Doctor and Jamie go to take Victoria by the hand and end up taking each others. This was in the knowledge that, with the recording schedule and the likelihood that re-takes would not be possible, it would have to be left in.", "When the BBC's film archive was first properly audited in 1978, this serial was one of many believed missing (although it is absent in earlier 1976 listings). This story was prepared for release in early 1992 on audio cassette as part of the \"Missing Stories\" collection, using recordings made by fans at home at the time of transmission, with newly recorded explanatory narration by Jon Pertwee. Then in late 1991, telerecordings of all four episodes were returned to the BBC from the Hong Kong-based Rediffusion company. In May 1992, the serial was released on VHS with a special introduction from director Morris Barry. The VHS release topped the sales charts throughout the country. This was the only Doctor Who story from the original era to top the UK charts."]}, {"page": "The Creature from the Pit", "response": ["David Brierley makes his debut as the voice of K9 in this story, taking over from John Leeson.
