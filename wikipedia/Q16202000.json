Though she is fully aware of his incompetence and the annoyance he causes his colleagues and customers, Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas, regarding him as honest and decent. His other deputy manager is the dim-witted but kind Colin Weatherby (Mike Burns) (credited as Michael Burns in series 1, 2 and 3). Colin has several medical problems including skin allergies, a constantly bandaged infected hand, and a sizeable boil on his face. Technically a deputy manager, he works more efficiently as the centre's caretaker."]}, {"page": "Michael Burns", "response": ["Mick, Micky, Mickey, Mike or Michael Burns may refer to:", "*Michael Burns (actor) (born 1947), American performer during 1960s and 1970s; later historian and academic", "*Michael Burns (executive) (born 1958), American vice chairman of Lionsgate", "*Michael Burns (Tennessee politician) (1813\u20131896), Irish-born American banker and businessman", "*Michael Burns (Gaelic footballer) (1961\u20132015), Irish Gaelic midfielder", "*Michael Burns (footballer) (born 1988), English midfielder", "*Michael Burns (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1979), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people from York", "response": ["*Michael Burns (born 1952)"]}]}}
