He was a lecturer in Political Economy at St. Andrews before  standing unsuccessfully for the Dundee East constituency in 1970. He was briefly a councillor in the London Borough of Bromley in the mid-1970s. He was elected MP for East Renfrewshire in 1979 and continued as MP in its successor Eastwood from 1983 until 1997. He served two spells as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland at the Scottish Office from 1981 to 1986, and from 1990 to 1995.\nStewart was forced to resign his ministerial post after an incident in February 1995 when he brandished a pickaxe at demonstrators who were protesting at the construction of the M77 motorway. Stewart was hospitalised, in Dykebar Hospital, Paisley, after suffering a nervous breakdown and due to accusations about his personal life   in March 1997. He stood down, not seeking re-election to Parliament in the General Election held on 1 May that year, and subsequently retired altogether from politics. Stewart died in December 2016 at the age of 74.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tam Dalyell", "response": ["In the 1990s, Dalyell asked the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, to grant diplomatic immunity to Lester Coleman, a co-author of Trail of the Octopus, so that he could give evidence in the Lockerbie bombing trial in Scotland; the US Government had indictments against Coleman, accusing him of passport fraud and perjury. Allan Stewart, a former Scottish Office minister and Conservative MP for Eastwood, also said that Coleman should be granted immunity so he could testify in Scotland. The Lord Advocate rejected Dalyell's plea, saying that the Home Office and the English courts had jurisdiction over the demand of the US government's extradition demand regarding Coleman, and that the Crown Office and the Scottish Office had no authority over the case.

The road cost \u00a353 million and destroyed 5,000 trees in a  stretch of the park. Protesters, including local schoolchildren, attempted to prevent this using tactics such as building and occupying treehouses and tunnels. There was also a \"Carhenge\" of burnt-out and half-buried cars, from as far afield as Brighton, placed in the path of the road. Eviction of the camp by Wimpey bailiffs and police began on 23 March 1995, arresting 15 and injuring one. Though the camp failed to prevent the road being built, it was a formative experience for many Glasgow activists who had no previous experience of direct action. It also led to the resignation of M.P. Allan Stewart. As campaigners feared, the motorway has disconnected the park from communities to its north and west (Pollok, Corkerhill and Mosspark) with almost no direct access - there is one walkway on the north bank of the White Cart from near Corkerhill); by contrast, the eastern side of the park has three vehicular routes and two more access points for pedestrians and cyclists."]}, {"page": "East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Allan Stewart"]}, {"page": "Back to Basics (campaign)", "response": ["*On 8 February 1995, Under-Secretary of State for Scotland Allan Stewart resigned from the Scottish Office after waving a pickaxe at an anti-motorway protester.
