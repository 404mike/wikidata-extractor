A day later Dumbarton suffered their second consecutive home defeat, losing 3\u20132 to Forfar Athletic with Bobby Barr scoring twice. Ben Armour became the club's first signing of the window, joining on a development loan from Greenock Morton, whilst Dom Thomas returned to Kilmarnock at the end of his loan spell. Armour made his debut the next day, starting in a 1\u20130 defeat to ninth placed Brechin City, where Sons conceded in injury time and played half-an-hour with ten men following the dismissal of Michael Paton. The following day club captain Andy Dowie left by mutual consent to focus on a career outside football. Dowie was followed by summer arrivals Brad Spencer and Jamie McGowan who were both released on 16 January. David Ferguson became the club's second signing of the window, joining on loan from Ayr United and his arrival was quickly followed by that of Henk van Schaik who joined on a temporary transfer from Livingston. Both players made their debut in a 1\u20131 draw with Montrose, with trialist striker Boris Melingui scoring for the Sons. Melingui signed a contract until the end of the season on 30 January and his arrival was followed by that of goalkeeper Conor Brennan who also joined following his release by Brechin City.
