The game ended 3\u20131 in Stevenage's favour, with all four goals coming in the first-half. The hosts opened the scoring after fifteen minutes when Luke Freeman drove a left-wing ball across goal, which was ultimately turned into his own net by AFC Wimbledon defender Pim Balkestein. Stevenage doubled their advantage seven minutes before the interval. AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper Seb Brown mis-timed a heavy defensive back pass, with the ball falling to debutant James Dunne, who slotted the ball into an empty net. The visitors responded immediately, Brendan Kiernan reducing the deficit when he successfully connected with a Luke Moore cross. Just four minutes later, in first-half injury time, Stevenage restored their two-goal cushion. A Greg Tansey free-kick was met on the half-volley by Marcus Haber; with Haber's volley goalbound, captain Mark Roberts slid in at the back post to ensure the ball crossed the line. Despite a number of goalscoring opportunities for the hosts in the second period, the scoreline remained the same and Stevenage progressed to the second round of the competition for the first time in their history."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 AFC Wimbledon season", "response": ["|= ||MF|| ||18 ||Brendan Kiernan || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1", "| align=\"center\" |  Brendan Kiernan"]}, {"page": "AFC Wimbledon Development Squad and Academy", "response": ["*  Brendan Kiernan"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 EFL League Two", "response": ["|Brendan Kiernan"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Harrogate Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|MF||||14||Brendan Kiernan||4||0||2||0||6"]}]}}
