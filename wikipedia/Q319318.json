According to legend, Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating the \"rugby\" style of play. Although the story has become firmly entrenched in the sport's folklore, it is not supported by substantive evidence, and is discounted by most rugby historians as an origin myth.\nThe William Webb Ellis Cup is presented to the winners of the Rugby World Cup.", "link_mentions": {}}}
