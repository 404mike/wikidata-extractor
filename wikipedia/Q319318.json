In her analysis of early football, Hibbins concludes that Thompson's journalistic ability as a promoter of the game \"probably\" makes him the most significant pioneer, and that the importance of Wills' role has been over-emphasised. Echoing Hibbins' arguments, Roy Hay writes that Wills, while a \"catalyst\" for football, was \"much more interested in playing and performing than in organising\".

The rules had always been determined by the pupils instead of the masters and they were frequently modified with each new intake. Rule changes, such as the legality of carrying or running with the ball, were often agreed shortly before the commencement of a game.

Organized varieties of football began to take form in 19th century in English public schools.  According to legend, William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating a new style of play in which running with the ball predominated instead of kicking. Football soon began to be played at colleges and universities in the United States.  Each school played its own variety of football. Princeton University students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820. A Harvard tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes, played at The Delta, the space where Memorial Hall now stands.

The Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \"Football Fightum\", for whom they conducted funeral rites. The authorities held firm and it was a dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard. Dartmouth played its own version called \"Old division football\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, and violence and injury were common. The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them.
