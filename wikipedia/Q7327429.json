He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler.\nDespite having played hockey at junior level, Logan's passion always lay in cricket, having represented England at Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 levels. He joined Nottinghamshire in 2000, snubbing an offer from Northamptonshire.\nHaving suffered a shoulder injury in 2001, he returned and made an instant impact with 11 wickets in the following two matches. He stayed at Nottinghamshire for four years before switching to Hampshire in 2004.\nIn 2005 he helped Hampshire to a runners-up spot in the Frizzell County Championship.\nIn 2009 he played in the inaugural London T20 Cricket League where his team, Kensington & Chelsea were the eventual winners.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["The third day saw yet another change in fortunes, which just about left Hampshire on top.
