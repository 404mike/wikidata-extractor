She was the subject of a portrait by Adam Buck, and a caricature by Isaac Cruikshank; ten days after the latter's publication, the Duke resigned from his post as Commander of the British Army.

When Addington's ministry fell in April 1804, Folkestone continued in opposition to Pitt. By now he was close to the radical pamphleteer, William Cobbett, with whom he campaigned against corruption in government through the impeachment of Lord Melville and the prosecution of Lord Wellesley for his conduct as governor general of India. The climax of their campaign was the attempt to impeach the commander-in-chief, the Duke of York, whose former mistress, Mary Anne Clarke, had been selling commissions. By the time of the Duke's resignation in March 1809, Folkestone was emerging as leader of the younger radicals in the Commons and featured in several of Gillray's cartoons.

Other possible models for the Sharp character have been suggested as Mary Anne Clarke and Harriette Wilson, two of the most well known English courtesans of the Regency era.  Clarke was originally Mistress of the Regent's brother, the Duke of York, and in 1809 had been at the centre of a scandal in which she acknowledged selling officers' commissions with the duke's knowledge, who\u2014being Commander-in-chief\u2014subsequently resigned. Clarke attempted to publish her memoirs on the matter; they were suppressed, but she received a \u00a310,000 payment and an annuity from the King. Harriette Wilson\u2014described by Walter Scott as having \"lived with half the gay world at hack and manger\"\u2014also published her memoirs. She too had profited from her liaisons with important society men, and had become mistress to the Earl of Craven at the age of 15; her memoirs went through over 30 editions in their year of publication. Says Frazee, \"these two most celebrated courtesans of the Regency provided Thackeray with material which, when added to that he acquired from first-hand knowledge of women like Becky and from his reading of fiction\" enabled him to create a realistic Regency courtesan in Sharp."]}, {"page": "Vicary Gibbs (judge)", "response": ["Hostile to Grenville, he lost his seat at Totnes, but the formation of the second Portland government in 1807 saw him made Attorney General and returned to Parliament for Great Bedwyn.

Under the Portland and Perceval ministries, he was noted for his zealous activities against publishers of seditious libels. In the House of Commons, his most significant activity occurred in 1809, during the inquiry into military corruption and the activities of Mary Anne Clarke, mistress of the Duke of York.
