Jake Buxton and Gareth Roberts signed new contract to the length of two years and one year respectively. The club also entered into contract talks with Paul Green, whose contract expired at the end of the season and who had attracted interest from Leeds United, among others. The club gave Green until April 2012 to respond. Green rejected Derby's contract offer on 20 April and left the club in the summer. Rams coach Johnny Metgod stated that the club were also in contract talks with Jamie Ward whose contract ended in the summer of 2013. Ward signed a new two-year contract, with an option for a further year which will extend his stay at Derby until at least the summer of 2014. Lee Croft and Miles Addison, both with one year left on their contract, were told that they were free to leave the club in the summer. Defender and captain Shaun Barker, who was injured in a 1\u20130 win against Nottingham Forest in March 2012 is set to miss the season due to injuries to his medial, anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments. Barker remains optimistic for a full recovery.", "Following the completion of the 2011\u201312 season, Derby announced their retained list for the 2012\u201313 campaign. Goalkeeper James Severn, defender Chris Jones and midfielders Aaron Cole and Ryan Connolly were all told that their contracts would not be renewed and joined Paul Green in leaving the club. Goalkeepers Ross Atkins and Saul Deeney had one-year contract options activated, whilst out of contract pair Conor Doyle and Alex Witham were also retained by the club. Academy players Stefan Galinski, Mats M\u00f8rch and Kane Richards all became first year professionals after they completed two-year scholarships. Miles Addison, James Bailey, Lee Croft, Steve Davies and Chris Maguire were all transfer listed by the club on 22 May. Addison attracted the interest of former loan club Bournemouth and several Championship clubs, later joining Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee. Davies, joint top scorer in 2011\u201312, was transfer listed due to turning down a three-year contract offer due to \"family reasons\", a decision which Nigel Clough fully respected. Newly promoted Championship club Sheffield Wednesday had two bids for Maguire rejected in May before a third offer in June was accepted and Maguire joined Wednesday for an undisclosed fee. Midfielder Lee Croft joined League One side Oldham Athletic until the end of the season.", "!Miles Addison"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 AFC Bournemouth season", "response": ["|24||  Miles Addison || DF, MF || Newham|| || Derby County||12 July 2012||Undisclosed||30 June 2015", "|24||DF||Miles Addison||4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0"]}, {"page": "Addison, Miles", "response": ["#redirectMiles Addison"]}]}}
