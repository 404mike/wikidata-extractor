Due to the song's popularity, it was released as a single throughout the world. In English, \"Bailamos\" means \"We Dance\" (We Are Dancing). In the United States, the song was seen as part of a wave of crossover music from Latin American singers and a general increase in interest in Latin music, which was started by Ricky Martin's release \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" as well as Carlos Santana's collaboration with Matchbox 20 frontman Rob Thomas of \"Smooth\". The success of \"Bailamos\" was a breakthrough for Iglesias, which enabled him to sign a multi-album deal with Interscope Records.
