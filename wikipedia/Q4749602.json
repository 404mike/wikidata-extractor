The tooth had been found years prior in the Upper Snake Creek beds of Nebraska along with other fossils typical of North America. Osborn received the specimen in March 1922, and quickly set out to identify it. Osborn, along with Dr. William D. Matthew soon came to the conclusion that the tooth had belonged to an anthropoid ape. They then passed the tooth along to William K. Gregory and Dr. Milo Hellman, who agreed that the tooth belonged to an anthropoid ape more closely related to humans than to other apes. Only a few months later, an article was published in Science announcing the discovery of a manlike ape in North America.  An illustration of H. haroldcookii was done by artist Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Forestier, who modeled the drawing on the proportions of \"Pithecanthropus\" (now Homo erectus), the \"Java ape-man,\" for the Illustrated London News.
