In 1995/96, he was named as the Ulster Footballer of the Year. After his first spell in Northern Ireland he had a successful spell in English football, initially joining Notts County in August 1996 where he scored once against Newcastle Town in the FA Cup, before moving onto Watford a season later, where he led the Hornets to promotion to Division One as their highest goalscorer. He scored two goals in quick succession in the derby with Luton Town, a hat-trick against Southend United, and a splendid long-range effort against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup. The following season was arguably the highlight of his career as he helped Watford gain promotion to the Premier League in 1999. In the Premier League, he scored Watford's first goal of the season, a penalty against Wimbledon. He left Watford at the end of the 2000/01 campaign and spent three seasons at Wigan, spending a period on loan at Derby County where he scored once against Ipswich Town. His final English club was Peterborough United, after which he returned to Northern Ireland. At the end of the 2007\u201308 season Peter did not have his contract renewed by Portadown and left the club. He began training with Ballymena United FC but decided to retire from his footballing career to focus on becoming an accountant. After a year Peter came out of retirement and made a return to football by signing for Donegal Celtic FC who play in the IFA Championship.\nHe has three children: Annie, Olivia and Peter.He was born in Lisburn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northern Ireland national football B team", "response": ["*Peter Kennedy"]}, {"page": "Kilmore Recreation F.C.", "response": ["*Peter Kennedy (Former Northern Ireland professional footballer) played for Kilmore during the 2009/2010 season."]}, {"page": "Peter Kennedy", "response": ["Peter Kennedy may refer to:", "* Peter Kennedy (cricketer) (born 1965), New Zealand cricketer", "* Peter Kennedy (figure skater) (born 1927), American pair skater", "* Peter Kennedy (folklorist) (1922\u20132006), folklorist and folk musician", "* Peter Kennedy (folk-rock musician) of The Kennedys", "* Peter Kennedy (footballer) (born 1973), Northern Irish footballer", "* Peter Kennedy (priest), controversial priest in Australia ", "* Peter Kennedy (economist) (1943\u20132010), Canadian economist", "* Peter Kennedy (sailor) (born 1964), Irish Olympic sailor", "* Peter Kennedy (diplomat) (born 1949), New Zealand ambassador"]}, {"page": "Ulster Footballer of the Year", "response": ["|  1995\u201396 || ||align=left| Peter Kennedy || align=left| Portadown|| "]}, {"page": "1999 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["Watford faced Birmingham City in their play-off semi-final and played the first leg at their home ground of Vicarage Road on 16 May 1999.
