With youth team product Nathan Munson on the books, McDonough brought in John Keeley from Oldham Athletic in the summer. However, his performances did not convince and he played his final game for the club in November 1993. This meant a string of mid-season transfers and loans of goalkeepers into the club, and the U's ended the season having once again used six different goalkeepers. McDonough even found himself in goal in October 1993 when facing Hereford United after Keeley and substitute Munson were both sent off for professional fouls. The U's went on to lose that game 5\u20130. Colchester were the first Football League club to have two goalkeepers sent off in the same fixture. Hereford striker Chris Pike scored a hat-trick in the game, with each of his goals coming against three different goalkeepers."]}, {"page": "Nathan Munson", "response": ["Born in Colchester, Gilberd School student Munson was brought through the Colchester United youth system and was handed his first-team debut by Roy McDonough at the end of the 1992\u201393 season. The game against Wrexham finished 4\u20133 to the Welsh club, conceding an 89th-minute winner from Steve Watkin on 8 May 1993. His next appearance for the club came in bizarre circumstances as Colchester became the first club to have two goalkeepers sent off in the same fixture. The game against Hereford United on 16 October 1993 saw John Keeley sent off in the 43rd minute, the U's already 1\u20130 down from a Chris Pike goal. Roy McDonough covered in goal until half time, where he conceded another goal to Pike. Munson was brought on at half time but was sent off in the 68th minute after conceding to Chris Fry and Pike once again, giving him a hat-trick, scoring against three different goalkeepers in the same game. McDonough returned to goal following Munson's dismissal and conceded again, this time to Derek Hall in the 88th minute to result in a disastrous 5\u20130 loss."]}, {"page": "Oliver Pike (cricketer)", "response": ["He is the cousin of Welsh footballer Gareth Bale and the son of former Cardiff City footballer Chris Pike."]}, {"page": "List of outfield association footballers who played in goal", "response": ["|McDonough took over after John Keeley was sent off two minutes before half-time against Hereford United. He was replaced at half-time by substitute goalkeeper Nathan Munson, but McDonough took over again later in the game after Munson was also sent off.
