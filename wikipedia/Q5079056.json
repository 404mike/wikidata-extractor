He was active in the Factory Reform movement, in the opposition to the New Poor Law, and in opposition to state involvement in religious and educational matters, but was rarely prominent in them, being more sought after as a chairman of meetings than as a speaker at them, and too inclined to moderation and compromise to be accepted as a reliable leader.

This was followed by an agitation in the West Riding for relaxation or repeal of the 1833 Act; the short-time movement alleged that workers were being 'leant on' by their employers to sign petitions for repeal, and countered by holding meetings and raising petitions for a ten-hour act. Charles Hindley prepared a draft bill limiting the hours that could be worked by any mill employing people under twenty-one, with no child under ten to be employed, and no education clauses. Hindley's bill was published at the end of the 1834-5 parliamentary session, but was not taken forward in the next session, being pre-empted by a government bill introduced by Charles Poulett Thomson, the President of the Board of Trade, allowing children twelve or over to work twelve hours a day.

However, this came two days after Peel's abandonment of the Corn Laws: Ashley supported Peel's volte-face but although he was not pledged to his Dorsetshire constituents to support the Corn Laws, considered that it had been an understanding with them that he would. He, therefore, resigned from Parliament rather than vote against his personal views or the wishes of his constituents; later further clarifying the situation by saying that he would not contest the by-election brought about by his resignation.  Fielden then took charge of Ashley's Factory Bill. The  Bill proposed a one-year experiment with an eleven-hour day before moving to a ten-hour day:Text is given in  however some of the Bill's supporters appeared to envisage settling for an eleven-hour limit: when an opponent contrasted this with Fielden's position of 'Ten Hours and no compromise' Fielden denied that he had said anything about a compromise. There was considerable agitation in the country for a Ten-Hour Bill and more petitions were presented to Parliament supporting the 1846 Bill than for repeal of the Corn Laws; however the Bill was defeated at Second Reading 193-203.  Fielden's advice to the Short Time Committees was that they should continue to press for ten hours, submit a Ten-Hour Bill again in the next session, and reject any eleven-hour compromise; other MPs associated with the movement (such as Charles Hindley) were more prepared to consider an eleven-hour compromise.  To answer two arguments which opponents of the 1846 Bill had made much of, meetings (twenty-one in all)  were held in most of the major textile towns of Northern England (generally addressed by one or more of Lord Ashley, Fielden or Oastler): all were well attended, and at each motions were passed to declare that "]}, {"page": "Adelaide city centre", "response": ["*Hindley \u2013 Charles Hindley MP, Director of South Australian Company"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["The first Moravian general election victor was Charles Hindley at the 1835 general election."]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["The first Moravian general election victor was Charles Hindley at the 1835 general election."]}, {"page": "Hindley Street, Adelaide", "response": ["Hindley Street is located in the north-west quarter of the centre of Adelaide, the capital of South Australia.
