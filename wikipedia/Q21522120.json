He collected algae on a UQ Science Students excursion to Noosa in 1948, and this collection was used to forward his future field of study. Queensland did not have any experts in algae at the time. Cribb travelled to New Zealand where he studied under Professor Val Chapman, before moving into his Honours program. He took up a position as a demonstrator in the Department of Botany and worked with visiting academic Dr Tore Levring of Sweden studying marine algae on Heron Island. Cribb was appointed a research officer with the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography at Cronulla in 1950. He escorted Professor Lily Newton, a British expert in seaweeds, when she came to Australia at the invitation of CSIR (now CSIRO) in 1950. Cribb spent two years reviewing algae, especially Macrocystis from Tasmania. He returned to Queensland in 1952, taking up work as a botany lecturer at the University of Queensland. He took his PhD in 1958. He was Head of the Department of Biology from 1978 to 1982 and remained in the department until his retirement in 1988."]}]}}
