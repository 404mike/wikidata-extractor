In time they began calling themselves the Football Hooligans and changed their names to Bex (Zak Zodiac) and Bud (Roy Bevis). Their first match under the name of the Football Hooligans came in November at a Herts And Essex Wrestling and World Association Of Wrestling joint event which the pair won. The pair would go on quite the winning streak in early 2011 which led to a street fight against the Devil's Playboys (Brett Meadows and Sam Knee) for the HEW Tag Team Championship. Winning this match marked the first tag team championship for the newly named Hooligans. With their success in the United Kingdom, the Hooligans travelled over to Germany to take on Christian Eckstein & Leon van Gasteren at European Wrestling Promotion for the EWP Tag Team Championship, but would return to England unsuccessful. The Hooligans have begun appearing for one of Britain's top wrestling promotions, International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom where they have traded wins with Project Ego (Kris Travis & Martin Kirby). The Hooligans have also appeared for All Star Wrestling. On 15 September 2012, they defeated Army of Two (Scott Fusion & Aaron Sharpe) to win the vacant RQW European Tag Team Championship and would lose them to Army of Two on 23 March 2013.  The Hooligans debuted for ICW in their hometown of Norwich on 17 October 2015."]}]}}
