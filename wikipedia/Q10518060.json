Unhappy at Eton College (1893\u20131900), it was at King's College, Cambridge where he really developed, matriculating in 1900. This was followed by a research studentship at the London School of Economics. His work at the LSE on what became the first volume of his History of British Patriotism (1913) led to his election in 1907 to a fellowship at King's College, Cambridge, which he retained until 1913. In the same year he was awarded the degree of DScEcon by the University of London. In 1915 he married Barbara Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel H. L. Errington and the Hon. Mrs Errington. After war service in India, Wingfield-Stratford sought no further academic advancement, instead settling down (thanks to an independent income) to a very productive life as historian and author, dividing his time between his rural home at Berkhamsted and London, where he could follow his many interests in the theatre, music and the arts. He also developed a taste for foreign travel. He married Barbara Elizabeth Errington on 30 December 1915, and on 9 Nov 1916 had a daughter, Roshnara Barbara Wingfield-Stratford (who married and later divorced Richard John Wrottesley, 5th Baron Wrottesley)The Peerage entry for Esme Cecil Wingfield-Stratford", "* Amazon Author page for Esm\u00e9 Cecil Wingfield-Stratford"]}, {"page": "Stratford (surname)", "response": ["*Brigadier-General Cecil Wingfield-Stratford CB, CMG (1853\u20131939) a British Army officer in the Royal Engineers and an English international footballer", "*Esm\u00e9 Cecil Wingfield-Stratford (1882\u20131971) an English historian, writer, mind-trainer, outdoorsman, patriot and ruralist"]}, {"page": "North Midland Divisional Engineers", "response": ["* Brig-Gen Cecil Wingfield-Stratford, appointed 19 October 1914"]}]}}
