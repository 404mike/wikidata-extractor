Further English expeditions from 1618 to 1621, including under Richard Jobson, were attempted but resulted in huge losses. Merchants of the Commonwealth of England sent expeditions to the Gambia in 1651, but their ships were captured by Prince Rupert the following year. In 1651, the Couronian colonization of the Gambia had also begun, with forts and outposts being erected on several islands. The Courlanders remained dominant until 1659 when their possessions were handed over to the Dutch West India Company. In 1660, the Courlanders resumed possession, but the next year was expelled by the newly formed Royal Adventurers in Africa Company.", "In the meantime, a relief expedition had departed from England under the command of Richard Jobson, who seized some Portuguese shipping as a reprisal for the massacre at Gassan. Jobson also made his way up to Neriko and subsequently gave a very positive account of the commercial opportunities of the River Gambia. During his expedition, Jobson refused slaves offered by an African merchant, Buckor Sano. He said that \"we were a people who did not deal in such commodities, neither did we buy or sell one another, or any that had our own shapes.\" His protests were noted as \"exceptional\" by Hugh Thomas.Thomas, p. 175 However, both his and Thompson's expedition had resulted in significant losses and a subsequent voyage that he made in 1624 proved a complete failure. After a loss of \u00a35,000, the patentees made no further attempts to exploit the resources of the Gambia but confined their attention to the Gold Coast."]}, {"page": "Richard Jobson", "response": ["Richard Jobson may refer to:", "*Richard Jobson (explorer), 17th-century English explorer", "*Richard Jobson (footballer) (born 1963), English former footballer", "*Richard Jobson (television presenter) (born 1960), filmmaker, TV presenter, and musician, formerly of Skids"]}, {"page": "Music history of the United States during the colonial era", "response": ["The banjo was a feature of slave life in America, mentioned by Thomas Jefferson, for example, in his Notes on the State of Virginia, in which he referred to it as a banjar and noted that the instrument came from Africa.  Other names included bangoe, banshaw, bangelo, banza, bangil and banjer.  The instrument was described in West Africa as early as 1620 by Richard Jobson, but was present for some time before."]}, {"page": "Ngoni (instrument)", "response": ["The ngoni (also written ng\u0254ni, n'goni, or nkoni) is a string instrument, traditional guitar of Mali. Its body is made of wood or calabash with dried animal (often goat) skin head stretched over it. The ngoni, which can produce fast melodies, appears to be closely related to the akonting and the xalam. This is called a jeli ngoni as it is played by griots at celebrations and special occasions in traditional songs called fasas in Mandingo. Another larger type, believed to have originated among the donso (a hunter and storyteller caste of the Wassoulou cultural region) is called the donso ngoni. This is still largely reserved for ceremonial purposes. The donso ngoni, or \"hunter's harp,\" has six strings. It is often accompanies singing along with the karagnan, a serrated metal tube scraped with a metal stick. The donso ngoni was mentioned by Richard Jobson in the 1620s, describing it as the most commonly used instrument in the Gambia. He described it as an instrument with a great gourd for a belly at the bottom of a long neck with six strings."]}, {"page": "Jobson", "response": ["*Richard Jobson (explorer), seventeenth-century English explorer", "*Richard Jobson (footballer) (born 1963), English", "*Richard Jobson (television presenter) (born 1960), Scottish singer-songwriter and film-maker, best known as a TV presenter"]}, {"page": "Kombo", "response": ["There are relatively few mentions of Kombo in early Western literature on the Gambia, owing primarily to the fact that European visitors primarily visited the northern ports. In 1621, as English explorer Richard Jobson was about to leave the Gambia, he recorded that he met the King of Kombo, who welcomed him to the country. Portuguese explorer Andr\u00e9 Donelha wrote in 1625 that Kombo \"produces much rice and is very beautiful.\" Another Portuguese explorer, Francisco de Lemos Coelho, wrote in 1688 that the King of Kombo was a Falupo, a general term meaning a Jola living near Casamance and that his village was the largest anywhere on the river. Coelho further wrote that Kombo had \"much wax and rice\" and that the King and his people were Pagan. In reality, he was a Mandinka while his mother was a Jola and he was a Muslim who probably was not very religious to attract European tourists and traders as many Muslims do today. The Masquerade Kumpo is named after Kombo.Gamble, p. 9"]}, {"page": "Francis Moore (geographer)", "response": ["Moore's observations were published as Travels Into the Inland Parts of Africa. The short account describes in rich detail the physical and cultural geography of the region before the intensification of the Atlantic slave trade and the resulting depopulation and economic disintegration.
