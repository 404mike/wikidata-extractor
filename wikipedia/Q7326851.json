He is known for engineering and sailing wind-driven vessels on land, ice, and water.  In 1999, he founded the Windjet Project [1] while studying mechanical engineering at Imperial College.  Since then he has designed, built, and tested four separate speed record craft. Jenkins is currently the founder and CEO of Saildrone, a company that designs, manufacturers, and manages unmanned surface vehicles that sail the world's oceans collecting science data. In 2019, SD 1020 became the first unmanned vehicle to complete a circumnavigation of Antarctica, crossing every longitude line in the Southern Ocean.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Land sailing", "response": ["The world land speed record for a wind-powered vehicle was broken on 26 March 2009 by Briton Richard Jenkins in his yacht Greenbird with a speed of 126.1\u00a0mph (202.9\u00a0km/h).BBC News - March 2009 - Wind-powered car breaks record  Wind speeds were fluctuating between  at that time.Wunderground weather history near Nipton, CA", "A previous attempt at the record by Britons Dale Vince and Richard Jenkins at Lake Lefroy in Western Australia in their carbon-neutral vehicle, Greenbird, failed on 12 September 2008.BBC News - September 2008 - Wind power speed record bid fails ", "*Racing yachts speed up to 120\u00a0km/h (the world speed record is 202.9\u00a0km/h (126.1\u00a0mph), set by Richard Jenkins in 2009,wired.com Freaky Speeder Rides the Wind to World Record breaking the previous record of 188\u00a0km/h (116.7\u00a0mph) set in 2001 by Bob Schumacher, US).

Saildrones have been used by scientists and research organizations like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to survey the marine ecosystem, fisheries, and weather. In January 2019, a small fleet of saildrones was launched to attempt the first autonomous circumnavigation of Antarctica.
