It enlisted the support of the local Member of Parliament, Martin Maddan, who sponsored a bill in Parliament which, despite much opposition from Hotel York Limited, became the Letchworth Garden City Corporation Act 1962. The act created a public body, the Letchworth Garden City Corporation. On 1 January 1963 the new corporation was to take over the garden city estate as it had existed at the end of 1960. The corporation's officers were appointed by the Crown, the county council and the urban district council.Miller, 2002, page 174 As the bill progressed through parliament and it became clearer that it would succeed, the relationship between First Garden City Limited and the council descended into open hostilities. When the new corporation's management finally arrived at the Estate Office on 1 January 1963 to take over, they discovered that the building had been stripped of its furniture and stationery the day before; it took some weeks to get Mrs Rose to release them.Plinston, 1981, page 200Miller, 2002, page 173"]}, {"page": "1965 Hove by-election", "response": ["*The Conservatives selected 44-year-old former MP Martin Maddan.
