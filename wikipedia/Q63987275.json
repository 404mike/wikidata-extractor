Heather once said that John threw Shane against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons; the window broke and Shane had to be taken to hospital, where John explained that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: 'Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father.' (John disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.)"]}, {"page": "Ilford County High School", "response": ["*Charles Stapley (1925-2011), actor"]}, {"page": "Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College", "response": ["* Charles Stapley, actor in Crossroads"]}, {"page": "Nan Winton", "response": ["In 1948 Winton married the actor Charles Stapley, who later appeared as Ted Hope in Crossroads.
