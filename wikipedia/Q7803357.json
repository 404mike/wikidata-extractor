He was a student of Arnaldo Momigliano and wrote a dissertation entitled \"Cato's Origines and the non-Roman historical tradition of ancient Italy\". He was a fellow at Christ's College, Cambridge (1973\u201375), Assistant Director of The British School at Rome (1975\u201377), lecturer and senior lecturer in Ancient History at University College London (1978\u201388, 1988\u201395).\nBetween 1995 and 2011 he was a Professor of Ancient History at the University of Manchester, apart from a brief period as Director of the Institute of Classical Studies at the School of Advanced Study, University of London (2004-2006).

After the incorporation of leaders from Alba Longa into the senate, it became necessary to erect a new building to accommodate the now much bigger Roman Senate. Thus the Curia Hostilla was built. It was universally held by tradition to have been built by\u2014and named in honor of\u2014Tullus, and its remains on the northwestern edge of the Forum have been dated to around 600 BC. Although that date falls well outside the traditionally-ascribed period of  Tullus Hostilius' reign, scholars are dubious regarding the tales of the overly-long reigns of the Roman kings\u2014with an average reign of 34 years-per-king, the traditional chronology would be without historical parallel (the royal rulers of the remarkably stable and healthy English monarchy have an average reign of 21 years each). Recent archaeological research supports historian Tim Cornell's proposal of a more-plausible chronology which contracts the regal period from 240 years to around 120 years. This places the historical accomplishments of the kings between 625 BC\u2014the date that the archaeological record shows the first signs of Rome's urbanisation and unification\u2014and 500 BC. Using this timeframe, the construction of the Curia Hostilia is possible during the reign of Tullus Hostilius. It would also explain things which are otherwise puzzling: Tullus's name being attached to the building, and how, as Roman traditions attest, Tullus could have led Rome's successful wars against the Fidenae and Veii and the Sabines."]}, {"page": "1995 in literature", "response": ["*Tim Cornell \u2013 The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars"]}, {"page": "Cassia gens", "response": ["*Tim Cornell (editor), The Fragments of the Roman Historians, Oxford University Press (2013)."]}, {"page": "Fabia gens", "response": ["The most famous legend of the Fabii asserts that, following the last of the seven consecutive consulships in 479 BC, the gens undertook the war with Veii as a private obligation.  A militia consisting of over three hundred men of the gens, together with their friends and clients, amounting to a total of some four thousand men, took up arms and stationed itself on a hill overlooking the Cremera, a little river between Rome and Veii.  The cause of this secession is said to have been the enmity between the Fabii and the patricians, who regarded them as traitors for advocating the causes of the plebeians.  The Fabian militia remained in their camp on the Cremera for two years, successfully opposing the Veientes, until at last they were lured into an ambush, and destroyed.Livy, ii. 48-50.Dionysius, ix. 15-23.  Three hundred and six Fabii of fighting age were said to have perished in the disaster, leaving only a single survivor to return home.  By some accounts he was the only survivor of the entire gens; but it seems unlikely that the camp of the Fabii included not only all of the men, but the women and children of the family as well.  They and the elders of the gens probably remained at Rome.  The day on which the Fabii perished was forever remembered, as it was the same day that the Gauls defeated the Roman army at the Battle of the Allia in 390 BC.  This was the fifteenth day before the kalends of Sextilis, or July 18, according to the modern calendar.Livy, ii. 50; vi. 1.Dionysius, ix. 22.Ovid, Fasti, ii. 237.Plutarch, \"The Life of Camillus\", 19.Tacitus, Historiae, ii. 91.Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 194.  The story was considerably embellished at a later date in order to present it as a counterpart of the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 479 BC (hence the number of 306 Fabii, similar to the 300 Spartans of Leonidas).  However, Tim Cornell states that there is no reason to doubt the historicity of the battle, because the tribus Fabia\u2014presumably where the Fabii had their country estates\u2014was located near the Cremera, on the border with Veii.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, p. 311."]}, {"page": "Latin League", "response": ["The Latin League (c. 7th century BC \u2013 338 BC)Stearns, Peter N.

The reason for the appointment of a dictator was the death of the consul Publius Decius Mus while fighting the Latins, and the illness of the other, the famous Titus Manlius Torquatus. Since 341 Rome was waging the Latin War against its former Latin allies.Tim Cornell, Cambridge Ancient History, vol. VII part 2, pp. 360, 361. Livy says that an army from the city of Antium was operating in southern Latium, which the dictator Crassus was supposed to repel, but he did not engage them.Livy, viii. 12.

Taylor & Broughton, \"The Order of the Two Consuls' Names\", p. 6.Titus was sent to Sardinia, which had just come under Roman control in the aftermath of the First Punic War (264 BC \u2013 241 BC).  The war indemnity demanded by Rome was so high that Carthage could not pay its mercenaries, who rebelled.  While Carthage was fighting the mercenaries in Africa, its mercenaries stationed in Sardinia decided to rebel as well.Scullard, Cambridge Ancient History, vol. VII, part 2, pp. 566\u2013568.  Rome initially refused to support the Sardinian rebels, but in 237 BC Rome prevented Carthage from reclaiming the island on the pretext that its army had actually turned against Rome.Scullard, Cambridge Ancient History, vol. VII, part 2, p. 569.  Titus' mission was therefore to pacify the island, which he did successfully. He received a triumph for his victory over the rebels as a result.Livy, Periochae, 20.  Several ancient authors tell that after his victory, Titus closed the doors of the Temple of Janus, symbolically meaning that Rome and its neighbours were at peace.  It was only the first time that the temple was closed since the reign of Numa Pompilius\u2014the legendary second king of Rome\u2014and remained so for eight years; its gates then stayed open until Augustus closed them again after the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.Livy, i. 9.Plutarch, Numa, 20.Orosius, iv.12 \u00a7 2.
