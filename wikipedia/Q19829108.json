The author of many books on dance, she reviewed dance performances in a variety of outlets including Dancing Times  and Dance International, as well as being the ballet critic for the Daily Telegraph for 24 years.In addition to her writings on dance, she served as the co-editor for the literary estate of the American novelist and screenwriter Raymond Chandler following his death in 1959. After Chandler's death, his literary agent and lover Helga Greene and his private secretary Jean Fracasse entered into a legal battle over Chandler's estate. Following Greene's success in the courts, she hired Walker and Dorothy Gardiner to compile Chandler's letters, essays and unfinished novel into a book, Raymond Chandler Speaking. Walker worked for Greene's literary agency for 25 years, until Greene's death.Walker co-wrote a history of The Royal Ballet as well as writing a biography of the company's founder Ninette de Valois. She wrote biographies of the sultan Saladin and the Sunday Times dance critic Cyril W. Beaumont. She contributed articles on Anna Pavlova, George Balanchine and Michel Fokine for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Helpmann", "response": ["After being what his biographer Kathrine Sorley Walker calls \"an uninterested and recalcitrant scholar\" at  Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, Helpmann was taken on as a student apprentice by Anna Pavlova when she was on tour in Australia in 1926.

The compulsion was to continue the work and legacy of Diaghilev, the founder of the Ballets Russes, who had died in 1929, by filling the void after his troupe's collapse. The new company contracted two choreographers, George Balanchine and L\u00e9onide Massine, who set about hiring dancers.Kathrine Sorley Walker, De Basil's Ballets Russes, Hutchinson, London, England, 1982.", "Dropping the definite article from the start of their name, Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo opened at the Alhambra Theatre in London on 4 July 1933. They \"took the city by storm\". Kirsova danced the waltz in Les Sylphides on that opening night and the British ballet critic PW Manchester recalled her \"glorious back\" and remembered her performance as \"better than anybody I ever saw, except [Tamara] Karsavina. It was a totally different way of doing it, but magnificent.\"PW Manchester, interview by David Vaughan and Dale Harris, Ballet Review 6, 1977\u20138, New York, quoted by Kathrine Sorley Walker, De Basil's Ballets Russes, Hutchinson, London, England, 1982.", "Despite difficulties with the bands, Kirsova was steadily working her way into the hearts of the critics and the Australian audiences. It was the start of \"a tremendous public following\". One observer wrote of her performance in Les Sylphides that \"Kirsova, svelte in shimmering grace, distinguished herself ... in the pas de deux\".\"Russian Ballet: Brilliant Opening at His Majesty's\", The Age, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 2 November 1936. Towards the end of the season in Melbourne, Kirsova's pas de deux with Guerard in Scuola di Ballo was acclaimed as \"a delicious fragment, bubbling with high spirits and humour\". Haskell wrote of her portrayal of the \"shy, brilliant bird\" in The Firebird as \"one of the most perfect things seen in this or any other season\".Arnold L Haskell, quoted by Martha Rutledge and Sally O'Neil, \"Kirsova, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (1910\u20131962)\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol.15, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 2000. The Australian dance writer and archivist, Michelle Potter, has suggested that \"perhaps the roles for which she was most praised in the Australian press were those of the Ballerina in Petrushka and, especially when partnered by Igor Youskevitch, Columbine in Le Carnaval. Her performances in Les Sylphides were also especially admired, as was her portrayal of the widow in L'Amour sorcier\". Haskell said of Kirsova at this stage of the tour that her mazurka in Les Sylphides revealed to the full her \"gifts of elevation, strength and precision\".Arnold L Haskell in Table Talk, quoted by Kathrine Sorley Walker, De Basil's Ballets Russes, Hutchinson, London, England, 1982.", "The British ballet writer Kathrine Sorley Walker, in her history of de Basil's Ballets Russes, reported that by the end of the Melbourne season an \"extraordinary\" relationship had built up between dancers and public resulting in \"an emotional last night's performance\", followed by endless curtain calls and a \"flower-strewn\" stage. Despite that, the promoters, J. C. Williamson, were unhappy with the takings; in Melbourne they were more than quarter down on what could have been achieved if there had been full houses. They were also annoyed with what they considered to be low quality lighting and decor and the feeling that they had been fobbed off by de Basil with a \"second\" company.  ", "\"Triumphantly\", on 23 January,  Kirsova danced L'Oiseau de Feu. \"She was considered unforgettable and 'absolutely stunning' \" writes Sorley Walker. Thomas Armour, a dancer in the company, wrote: \"She was only half human and with her fine elevation she never seemed to belong to the earth.\"\"Letters to Mrs Margaret Power from Thomas Armour, 1936\u201338\", Victoria & Albert Museum, London, England, quoted by Kathrine Sorley Walker, De Basil's Ballets Russes, Hutchinson, London, England, 1982. Other tributes to Kirsova flowed. One critic wrote: \"Kirsova never looks lovelier\".Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 8 February 1937. Haskell declared that in this Australasian tour, which he followed as de Basil's liaison officer in the impresario's absence, \"Kirsova, ever an exquisite craftsman, made a success of every role she undertook, and worked with exceptional intelligence and an eye for detail that I have rarely seen equalled\".", "Kathrine Sorley Walker, De Basil's Ballets Russes, Hutchinson, London, England, 1982."]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Kathrine Sorley Walker, 95, ballet critic."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2015", "response": ["*Kathrine Sorley Walker, 95, English ballet critic.Kathrine Sorley Walker, dance critic \u2013 obituary"]}, {"page": "A.
