Curle argues here that feelings of hatred, anger, jealousy and the like are not unchangeable features of any individual, but rather the result of failures to understand and develop their own potential. Michael Hare Duke, in his review for the New Internationalist, acknowledged the importance of the interpersonal phenomena on which Curle focuses, but argued that the book lacked \"a clear recognition of the economic realities which lie behind any justice in the distribution of the world's resources.\""]}, {"page": "Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane", "response": ["|Michael Hare Duke"]}, {"page": "Michael Geoffrey Hare-Duke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Hare Duke"]}, {"page": "Michael Duke", "response": ["* Michael Hare Duke (1924\u20132014), Anglican bishop and author"]}, {"page": "Exit (right-to-die organisation)", "response": ["Exit uses the Carver Model of Policy Governance in the running of its affairs to ensure strict adherence to its aims.
