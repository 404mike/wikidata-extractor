His travels in Mexico and West Africa had a substantial influence on his art, particularly on the representation of the human figure in his sculptures and paintings. Underwood is best known for his sculptures cast in bronze, carvings in marble, stone and wood and his drawings. His lifetime's work includes a wide range of media and activities, with an expressive and technical mastery. Underwood did not hold modernism and abstraction in art in high regard and this led to critics often ignoring his work until the 1960s when he came to be viewed as an important figure in the development of modern sculpture in Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeffrey Archer", "response": ["Archer set up his own fundraising and public relations company, Arrow Enterprises, in 1969. That same year he opened an art gallery, the Archer Gallery, in Mayfair. The gallery specialised in modern art, including pieces by the sculptor and painter Leon Underwood. The gallery ultimately lost money, however, and Archer sold it two years later."]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Leon Underwood (1890\u20131975)"]}, {"page": "1890 in art", "response": ["* December 25 - Leon Underwood, English sculptor (died 1975)."]}, {"page": "Ralph Chubb", "response": ["From 1919 to 1922 Chubb studied at the Slade School of Art in London. It was there that he met Leon Underwood and other influential artists. He went on to contribute several articles and poems for Underwood's magazine, The Island. Although his work was displayed at such venues as the Goupil Gallery and the Royal Academy of Art, his paintings did not sell. There are several in public collections in Britain. His major painting The Well (1920) is in Wakefield; Southampton has bathers with boys wrestling, and there are nudes at Leamington, all illustrated in the Public Art Foundation catalogues. He moved with his family to the village of Curridge, near Newbury in Berkshire. He began to devote his artistic talents to the printed works which would remain his chief labour in life."]}, {"page": "Wood engraving", "response": ["*Leon Underwood"]}, {"page": "Perforated baton", "response": ["The spear thrower hypothesis was first put forward in an article by artist Leon Underwood in 1965.  In this, Underwood, who had previously engaged in experimental archeology working with bronze artifacts, rejected the classification of the b\u00e2ton perc\u00e9 as a \"magic wand\", and drew comparisons between it and more contemporary Inuit spear throwers.  Underwood's hypothesis was that the existing samples of the b\u00e2ton perc\u00e9 were in poor shape, and may have been missing a hook, such as that found on the Inuit spear thrower and the atlatl.  Underwood built two wooden models, based on different b\u00e2ton perc\u00e9 from museum collections, but with the addition of a 'nipple' or hook to the end of the shaft opposite the hole.  These reproductions were compared against Inuit designs, and were found to offer superior performance when throwing fletched spears; Underwood pointed out that the Inuit throwers, built using driftwood, were necessarily weaker and that the design reflected the available materials."]}, {"page": "Society of Wood Engravers", "response": ["* Leon Underwood"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Leon Underwood (1890\u20131975) \u2013 British sculptor, painter, and engraver"]}, {"page": "1975 in art", "response": ["* 9 October - Leon Underwood, English sculptor (b. 1890)"]}, {"page": "Underwood (surname)", "response": ["* Leon Underwood (1890\u20131975), British artist"]}, {"page": "New Marston", "response": ["St Michael's was designed by T.L.
