Pryce Campbell, the Presbyterian minister in Ardersier. In 1817 he obtained a cadetship in the service of the British East India Company, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Madras Army on 2 October 1818. Promoted to captain on 3 October 1826 during the First Anglo-Burmese War, Campbell served in the 43rd regiment of Madras native infantry from 1826-7, and was decorated with the Indian war-medal for services rendered. He was invalided out of active service in 1831 and promoted to major in 1836, before retiring from the army in 1839.Upon returning from India, Campbell was introduced by the sculptor Alexander Munro to Dante Gabriel and William Michael Rossetti, with whom he became good friends. He subsequently published short stories, prose sketches and poetry in numerous periodicals and assisted with the publication of the Germ in 1850. Campbell contributed a sensuous love sonnet in the style of Keats.Campbell died at his residence in University Street, London, on 13 May 1857. He was eulogised by the Athen\u00e6um as \u201ca graceful writer of the minor prose and poetry of his time, and a kind-hearted scholar and gentleman.\u201d", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine", "response": ["* 'On the Life and Character of Marshal St. Arnaud.' p. 389\u2013402. Essay about the Crimean War by a Robert Campbell. Fleming first cites the Wellesley Index, which states Robert Campbell (1832-1912) as the author, and confirms that he was about the age of the Morris Brotherhood. He published several books on legal theory. Next he quotes Gordon, which gives Robert Calder Campbell (1798-1857) as the author. Fleming thinks that this makes more sense. He frequently contributed to periodicals, and perhaps Fulford, as the editor in charge, asked \"professional writers\" to fill the columns of the Magazine."]}]}}
