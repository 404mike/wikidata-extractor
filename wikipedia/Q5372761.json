Most of Clarke's work has been used in television commercials and radio outside the United Kingdom, notably in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Voice acting", "response": ["Voice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement. At its simplest, each recording consists of a short phrase which is played back when necessary, such as the \"mind the gap\" announcement introduced on the London Underground in 1969, which is currently voiced by Emma Clarke. In a more complicated system, such as a speaking clock, the announcement is re-assembled from fragments such as \"minutes past\", \"eighteen\", and \"p.m.\" For example, the word \"twelve\" can be used for both \"Twelve O'Clock\" and \"Six Twelve\". Automated announcements can also include on-hold messages on phone systems and location-specific announcements in tourist attractions."]}, {"page": "Mind the gap", "response": ["While Lodge's recording is still in use, some lines use other recordings. From 2005  the voice of Phil Sayer was heard on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines.

Another announcement was recorded by voice artist Emma Clarke. At least 10 stations were supplied with announcers manufactured by PA Communications Ltd. of Milton Keynes. The recorded voice is that of Keith Wilson, their industrial sales manager at the time (May 1990). It can still be heard, at Paddington for example. It is Keith Wilson's voice that can be heard in the background of a scene in the Bond film Skyfall.", "It is also the title of a Noisettes song on their album What's the Time Mr. Wolf?. The phrase is used in the songs \"Deadwing\" by Porcupine Tree, \"Bingo\" by Madness, \"Someone in London\" by Godsmack, Metal Airplanes by Matthew Good and \"New Frontier\" by the Counting Crows.
