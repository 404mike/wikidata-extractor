The video for \"Bag It Up\" is based around a humorous and raunchy nature. It begins with an advert promoting the male-behaviour-altering \"Girl Powder\". Girl Powder, administered in small doses, transforms any male into an obedient domestic servant and also a sex slave. The video starts with a domestic scene. Geri and her shirtless 'boyfriend' (played by Aiden Turner) are sitting down in a living room watching television when an advert comes on for Girl Powder, which declares that it is \"Heaven in a box\". Halliwell is seen doing all the housework and cooking for her 'boyfriend'. She then goes to the kitchen to make him coffee, when really she is preparing the Girl Powder drink. Once her boyfriend drinks it, his hair becomes pink and he has been transformed into a subservient male. The action then moves to the \"Girl Powder\" factory, where Geri has been transformed into a catsuit-clad superheroine boss, controlling (along with other females in white lab coats) a factory operated by many pink-haired men. The next time Geri and her boyfriend are seen, the roles have been reversed. Geri is now the one in control, with the semi-clad sex slave pandering to her every whim, even acting as a human table. We then return to the factory, where Geri eventually strips the oiled-up dancers down to hot pants, bunny ears and high-heeled ankle boots. Eventually they end up pole-dancing, acting as bunny boys and parodying Playboy Bunnygirls, this time with the male as the sex object. We then see Geri parading the bunny boys on a leash at the end of the video, exhorting female listeners to \"Treat him like a lady\" and declaring \"Who's wearing the trousers now?\". The video ends with a white background and Geri's symbol as the TV switches off."]}, {"page": "Anna Devane", "response": ["In 2002, Anna finds David secretly meeting with Roger Smythe (Mark Pinter), a runner for Proteus.
