He specialized in Japanese aesthetics and was said by Dewing to have created paintings that were \"the most beautiful in all the world\" and greatly influenced her own work. As a student she had already begun to gain a reputation as a capable painter, her works attracted \"much attention for its broad, vigorous brush work, and rich, glowing color\" and were exhibited at the National Academy of Design.  She studied with John La Farge, and her work was influenced by La Farge's fascination with Japanese aesthetics. In 1875, Oakey and other students from the academy left to establish the now renowned Art Students League of New York.
