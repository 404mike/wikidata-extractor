He featured only eight times for manager Jim McLean, including one appearance at the very beginning of the club's UEFA Cup run to the final and moved back to England within three months with Blackburn Rovers, converting a loan move into a \u00a315,000 deal. He quickly built a left-sided partnership with Scott Sellars. He won the Full Members' Cup at Wembley in 1987, Colin Hendry scoring the only goal of the game against Charlton Athletic. Rovers finished the 1987\u201388 season in the Second Division play-off zone, but lost out to Sulley's former club Chelsea. The \"Riversiders\" again reached the play-offs in 1988\u201389, but were defeated by Crystal Palace in the final. Sulley lost his first-team place to John Millar, but later regained it. A third successive play-off appearance in 1989\u201390, this time Rovers lost to Swindon Town at the semi-final stage. After Rovers struggled in 1990\u201391 their manager Don Mackay departed. Bankrolled by Jack Walker, new manager Kenny Dalglish took the Lancashire outfit into the top-flight via the play-offs, as Rovers defeated Leicester City 1\u20130 in the final. In his six years with Blackburn, Sulley made close to 150 appearances, before Alan Wright managed to make the left-back position his own."]}, {"page": "John Millar", "response": ["John Millar may refer to:", "*John Millar (philosopher) (1735\u20131801), Scottish philosopher and historian", "*John Millar, Lord Craighill (1817\u20131888), Scottish judge", "*John Millar (Canadian politician) (1866\u20131950)", "*John Millar (footballer, born 1923) (1923\u20131986), Scottish footballer", "*John Millar (footballer, born 1927) (1927\u20131991), Scottish footballer", "*John Millar (footballer, born 1966), Scottish footballer (Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers, Heart of Midlothian)", "*John Millar, Scottish confectioner, see Millar McCowan", "*John Millar, American spiritual head of Elohim City, Oklahoma", "*John Millar, musician in The Hush Now", "*John Millar Andrews (1871\u20131956), Prime Minister of Northern Ireland", "*John Millar Watt (1895\u20131975), Scottish artist"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season", "response": ["|   MF || John Millar || 4|| 0 || 0|| 4"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season", "response": ["|   MF || John Millar || 6 || 2 || 1 || 9"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season", "response": ["|   MF || John Millar || 4|| 0 || 0 || 0 ||4"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season", "response": ["|    MF ||  John Millar || 1 || 0 || 0 ||0 || 1"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season", "response": ["|   MF || John Millar || 7|| 0 || 0 || 7"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| MF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  John Millar", "| January 1987 || LB ||  || John Millar ||  Chelsea || January 1987"]}, {"page": "John Millar (footballer born 1966)", "response": ["#redirect John Millar (footballer, born 1966)"]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["Simon Garner put Blackburn ahead after beating Paul Miller and Kenny Jackett and striking the ball past Tony Coton in the Watford goal.
