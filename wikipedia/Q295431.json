The intellectual discussion in the novel centres around the question of consciousness. The detailed views of consciousness that Ralph Messenger puts forth, while some are controversial, will be familiar to the contemporary cognitive scientist. On becoming acquainted with Messenger, Helen Reed, who holds the traditional \u2013 and seemingly almost old-fashioned \u2013 views that consciousness is the business of the humanities, in particular of the novel and of literary criticism; and that there is and should be a clear-cut Cartesian dualism between mind and body, this Helen Reed is confronted by the new (or even not-so-new) trend of considering the mind a mere function of the body. Characteristically, Helen's residual knowledge of, and belief in, Roman Catholicism prevents her from taking a real plunge into Messenger's world of values, where science is the universal problem-solver and where religion and also politics are considered as a curse to humankind. It obviously depends completely whose side you are on whether you consider attempts by renowned scientists at constructing robots as a complete waste of time or as paving the way for a better future society. Morality, especially conventional morals, have no place in this new view of the world and have long been discarded; sex has been reconsidered as having mainly recreational value. (At one point Messenger mentions the new principle: T.F.T. \u2014 Tit for Tat.) Charles Darwin is still believed to be the trigger of this trend that, advocates of this theory hope, will revolutionise future societies."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["|Julian Barnes || Flaubert's Parrot || Jonathan Cape", "|Julian Barnes || England, England || Jonathan Cape", "|Julian Barnes || Arthur & George || Jonathan Cape", "| rowspan=\"6\"| 2011||style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | Julian Barnes || style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | The Sense of an Ending || style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | Jonathan Cape", "*Julian Barnes"]}, {"page": "England, England", "response": ["England, England is a satirical postmodern novel by Julian Barnes, published and shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1998.
