Inspired by Kattwinkel's discovery, German geologist Hans Reck led a team to Olduvai in 1913. There, he found hominin remains which were later radiocarbon dated to 17,000 BP.  Four more expeditions were planned, but World War I prevented their start. After the war, as Tanganyika came under British control, Louis Leakey visited Reck in Berlin and viewed the Olduvai fossils.  Louis Leakey became convinced that Olduvai Gorge held stone tools, thinking the deposits were of similar age to the Kariandusi prehistoric site in Kenya.  Reck and the paleontologist Donald McInnes accompanied Louis Leakey in his 1931 expedition, where Louis found a number of hand axes close to camp soon after their arrival.  Mary Leakey first visited the area in 1935, joining Louis and Percy Edward Kent.  Subsequent visits were made by the Leakeys in 1941, 1953, 1955 and 1957."]}, {"page": "Helen Cooper (literary scholar)", "response": ["Cooper was born on 6 February 1947 in Nottingham, England.
