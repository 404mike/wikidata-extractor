His best season as a wicketkeeper was 1961, when he received his county cap and took 72 catches with 7 stumpings. As a batsman, he scored 561 runs in 1960 with an average of 12.46 and a highest score of just 44: the high aggregate reflects the fact that he went in at No 8 because in Terry Spencer, John Savage and Brian Boshier or Peter Broughton, there were usually three even worse batsmen than he was, and Leicestershire usually batted twice in each match. His highest score, one of only two innings over 50, was 51, made against Worcestershire in 1962 as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw."]}, {"page": "Haydon Smith", "response": ["Haydon Arthur Smith (29 March 1901 \u2013 7 August 1948) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Leicestershire from 1925 to 1939.

He was the uncle of later Leicestershire cricketer Terry Spencer."]}, {"page": "Bernard Cromack", "response": ["In 1960, in a very weak Leicestershire team, Cromack played in 20 first-team matches, often, in a brittle batting line-up, coming in as high as No 6, though he averaged less than 11 runs per innings for the season. With a bowling attack geared towards seam bowling with Terry Spencer and Brian Boshier, and an established spinner in John Savage, Cromack was bowled sparingly, and took only 28 wickets all season. The match against Middlesex at Lord's was his sixth first-class game, but to that point he had taken just two first-class wickets; he took six for 48 in Middlesex's first innings, the best bowling figures of his career. But then Leicestershire had to follow on and when they batted again they squandered a first-wicket partnership of 196 by losing all 10 wickets for a further 18 runs, giving the home team an easy victory. Two weeks later, he scored 55 against Hampshire, his highest score. There was a second half-century at the end of June with 53 in the game against Nottinghamshire. But Cromack's season subsided after that and he was left out of several matches in August."]}, {"page": "Rodney Pratt", "response": ["Pratt returned to county cricket in 1960 and for the next four seasons was a fairly regular member of the Leicestershire first team, usually acting as the third seam bowler after Terry Spencer and, often, Brian Boshier and batting around No 7 in the order \u2013 Leicestershire in this period had a very long tail. He had some successes as a batsman: in June 1960, for example, he made 71 against Hampshire and later in the same month there was 62 against Nottinghamshire. He did not improve on his previous best bowling figures in 1960, but in 1961 against Glamorgan, opening the bowling with Spencer, he took seven for 47 and these were the best bowling figures of his career. He took 65 wickets in 1961, and this was the best seasonal return of his career. Pratt missed the whole of the first half of the 1962 season, not appearing in the first team until July, a period in which Leicestershire failed to record a single victory in 13 County Championship matches. He then took 50 wickets and, although Leicestershire still finished at the bottom of the Championship table, in the last game of the season they came close to beating the Champions, Yorkshire, with Pratt taking 11 wickets in the match."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Terry Spencer (1955\u20131961) : C.
