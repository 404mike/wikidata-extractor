The programme was moved to the main newsroom within the ITN headquarters building, and full-length reports were now featured as part of the programme. ITN dispensed with the \"main\" presenter and relief host format, and instead a \"team\" of newscasters - Alastair Stewart, Fiona Armstrong, Nicholas Owen, Trevor McDonald, Sue Carpenter and Carol Barnes - began presenting the show on a \"rotation\" basis. On 13 February 1989, the introduction of a national weather forecast at the end of the programme led to the bulletin's timeslot starting earlier at 5:40pm, being extended in length and the title being changed to News at 540.", "*Sue Carpenter (1988\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "BBC Points West", "response": ["*Sue Carpenter"]}, {"page": "London Plus", "response": ["*Sue Carpenter"]}, {"page": "ITV Weekend News", "response": ["*Sue Carpenter (1988\u20131992)"]}, {"page": "Accident (Bottom)", "response": ["The episode begins with Eddie sitting down at the breakfast table looking severely hungover.

Eddie claims that the cards are the same ones Richie received every year. One of the cards is from ABBA with \"Happy Christmas 1973\" written inside. Another appears to be from the people of the Soviet Union \"in grateful thanks to comrade Richie\". Richie asks Eddie where his birthday gift is and, after annoying Richie with a couple of gag gifts (Richie's comb that he \"lost\" last week and the TV remote), Eddie hands Richie a piece of paper with the words \"Madame Swish 3:30\" written on it. Richie, believing it to be a prostitute's card, heaps praise on Eddie and becomes excited at the prospect of finally having sex. However, it soon comes to light that Madame Swish is actually a horse running in the 3:30 race at Kempton. An ungrateful Richie struggles to hide his disappointment, but eventually relents and gives Eddie \u00a320 to put on the horse, with odds of 10/1."]}, {"page": "List of former BBC newsreaders and journalists", "response": ["* Sue Carpenter \u2013 relief co\u2013presenter on 'News After Noon' and on Breakfast Time during the 1980s and was also a main presenter on Points West.
