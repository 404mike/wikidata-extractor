Talbot, with Major-General Charles Edward Callwell, Captain Cecil Lambert, Captain Herbert Richmond and the Admiralty's Director of Transport Graeme Thompson was part of a committee put together in September 1914 to plan for a naval landing at Gallipoli.  Talbot recorded that Callwell considered it was \"likely to prove an extremely difficult operation of war\" but thought a force of sixty thousand men could prevail.  Callwell had previously been against such an operation and may well have been persuaded to change his mind by Winston Churchill's force of will.  Talbot had returned to the retired list by 14 January 1916 when he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.  He assisted Reginald Wingate, Governor-General of the Sudan, with preparations for the defence of that country as a member of the Permanent Committee of Defence in 1916."]}]}}
