He was a partner in the banking firm of Glyn, Mills & Co. In 1865 he entered Parliament for Northallerton, a seat he held until 1866 when he was unseated due to bribery by his agents. Later, he represented Kent West from 1868 to 1885.\nHe succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1872, inheriting Hillingdon Court. On 15 February 1886 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hillingdon, of Hillingdon in the County of Middlesex.Lord Hillingdon had married Lady Louisa Isabella, daughter of Henry Lascelles, 3rd Earl of Harewood, in 1853.

By November 1849, he had made $40,000 and decided to make California his permanent home.  Therefore, in 1850, he returned to Buffalo where he sold his interest in the Bank and returned to Sacramento, where he founded his own bank, the \"Gold Bank of D. O. Mills & Co.\"  This was helped significantly by a cousin from the English branch of the Mills family, Charles Mills, 1st Baron Hillingdon, who ran the Glyn, Mills & Co. bank in London. He never invested in gold mining or silver mining directly, as he considered mining to be too speculative.  He rather started ancillary businesses that supported the mining industry, such as banks and railroads.  He was a part owner of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, which was the only link from the Comstock Lode to the Central Pacific Railroad.
