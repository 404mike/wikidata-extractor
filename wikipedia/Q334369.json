He was remarkable in having had successively three names, two wives and three faiths, and for being honoured by the Kings of two opposing countries in World War I.\nHe should not be confused with his grandfather Pierce Mahony (1792\u20131853), a close associate of Daniel O'Connell who was elected as MP for Kinsale in 1837 but unseated on petition; or with his son Pierce Gun Mahony (1878\u20131914).", "link_mentions": {}}}
