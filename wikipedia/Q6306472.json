He was for some years the chairman of Borchester Land, a property development company. An outsider by birth, Matt often inveigled himself into positions of power, such as the parish council, but many villagers were suspicious of his motives. For example, when local vet Alistair owed him a gambling debt, Matt said that he would reduce the amount he owed in exchange for the administration of performance-enhancing drugs to one of his racehorses. Alistair refused, and Crawford increased the pressure, forcing Alistair and Shula to take out a mortgage on the stables, which they already owned. Many years later this caused a rift between Alistair and his by then business partner Anisha Patel. In 2005, Matt divorced his wife Yvette and moved in with his new partner Lilian Bellamy (n\u00e9e Archer, daughter of Peggy Woolley). In this romance she calls him \"Tiger\" and he calls her \"Pussy-cat\". In early 2008, Crawford and Lilian were briefly separated when she suspected him of having an affair with a Borchester Land board member Annabelle Scrivener (Julia Hills). The following year Crawford was indicted for fraud, having made a business guarantee he knew was false. He was persuaded to co-operate with the authorities (in contrast with his less scrupulous colleague Stephen \"Chalkie\" Chalkman), but on practically the eve of the trial he fled in panic to Costa Rica, planning to live there as a fugitive. However, Lilian's unhappiness in prospective exile persuaded him to return, and he served an 18-month prison sentence. Upon his release on probation he created a new property development company, created with Lilian as director to circumvent his disqualification. Lillian took a more active role than he expected which caused some friction. Matt and Lilian's relationship ultimately came to an end in early 2015. Subsequent to Lilian having a brief affair with Matt's estranged brother Paul, (which she did not find out Matt knew about until later),  Lilian arrived home from a holiday to discover that he had emptied out all of their joint holdings, ransacked their house of valuables and fled to Costa Rica. In April 2017, Matt made a surprise re-appearance, claiming to have returned to Ambridge in order to repay his debt to Lillian."]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical", "response": ["| Julia Hills"]}, {"page": "List of 2point4 Children characters", "response": ["Rona Harris (Julia Hills) is Bill's best friend.
