His first introduction to political activity was during the 1926 general strike when he helped distribute the papers of the strike committee.  On International Workers' Day, 1 May, the following year he joined the CPGB and its youth wing the Young Communist League (YCL).  He became a signwriter but his career was cut short in July 1931 when he was arrested for distributing anti-militarist leaflets. He had been organising soldiers to demand better rights and conditions, an activity for which he was sentenced to 6 months in HM Prison Edinburgh. After a popular campaign calling for his release he was freed in January 1932 and began working for the party.\nGollan became the editor of the YCL's newspaper The Young Worker and its successor publication Challenge. He did this for several years until his election as General Secretary of the YCL in 1935.  He then held various regional posts before becoming the party's national organiser in 1945. In 1949, he became assistant editor of the Daily Worker, and in 1954 he became the party's Assistant General Secretary. In 1956 he became the party's General Secretary and immediately had to deal with the drop in membership following the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian Revolution. He held the post until 9 March 1975, when he resigned following ill health, and died in 1977.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Pollitt", "response": ["Pollitt, suffering from worsening health in his final years, resigned as General Secretary in May 1956, with John Gollan succeeding him, and was appointed CP Chairman. When Khruschev's denunciation of Stalin was formally made public the following month, Pollitt stated that he was \"too old to go into reverse and denigrate a man he had admired above all others for more than a quarter of a century\". Pollitt also refused to take down a portrait of Stalin that hung in his living room, saying that \"He's staying there as long as I'm alive\"."]}, {"page": "Gollan", "response": ["*John Gollan (1911-1977), Scotland-born worker in the Communist Party of Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Joe Thomas (communist)", "response": ["Joe was born to Welsh parents in Cricklewood, London on 27 February 1912. His father was a shop-keeper in the leather trade and an active freemason. Joe attended Haberdashers' Aske's Hampstead School, a local minor public school, to which his father was a supplier. His interest in socialism may have arisen in reaction to this establishment. He was active in the Young Communist League, coming into contact with Tom Mann, John Gollan and John Ross Campbell. By 1933 he was a junior clerical worker for ASLEF in Hampstead.The Life and Times of Joe Thomas - the road to libertarian socialism by Alan Woodward, Gorter Press, 2009, p6"]}, {"page": "Julia Pirie", "response": ["In Pirie's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, her obituarist writes that she was \"a small, dumpy woman with the appearance of a confirmed and rather matronly spinster\", whose \"unassuming demeanour masked a sharp intellect and the powers of observation essential for the task of a secret agent.\" She worked her way into the inner circles of the party, eventually working directly under party secretary John Gollan. This put her in a position to pass information from Gollan's office to her MI5 handlers. The Telegraph speculates that she may have been the inside agent who provided crucial information for two important MI5 operations described in Peter Wright's book Spycatcher."]}]}}
