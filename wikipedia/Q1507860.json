Because the island had no natural source of shelter, they constructed a shack and wind blocks from their remaining two lifeboats and pieces of canvas tents. Blubber lamps were used for lighting. They hunted for penguins and seals, neither of which were plentiful in autumn or winter. Shackleton instructed Wild to depart with the crew for Deception Island if he did not return to rescue them by the beginning of summer, but after four and a half months, on August 30, 1916, the artist George Marston spotted a ship. The ship, with Shackleton on board, was the tug Yelcho, from Punta Arenas, Chile, commanded by Luis Pardo, which rescued all the men who had set out on the original expedition."]}, {"page": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["The scientific staff of six accompanying Endurance comprised the two surgeons, Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy; a geologist, James Wordie; a biologist, Robert Clark; a physicist, Reginald W. James; and Leonard Hussey, a meteorologist who would eventually edit Shackleton's expedition account South. The visual record of the expedition was the responsibility of its photographer Frank Hurley and its artist George Marston.Fisher 1957, pp.\u00a0311\u2013314. The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. Some who left Britain for Australia to join Aurora resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp.\u00a048\u201353. Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the Nimrod expedition and had gone home early."]}, {"page": "Endurance (1912 ship)", "response": ["* George Marston, Artist"]}, {"page": "Chris Larkin", "response": ["| George Marston"]}, {"page": "Lyng, Somerset", "response": ["The East Lyng churchyard contains the grave of George Marston who was the artist for Ernest Shackleton's 1914 Endurance Trans-Antarctic Expedition."]}, {"page": "Personnel of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["| George Marston"]}]}}
