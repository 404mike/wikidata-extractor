In this match the hat-trick was performed by Northamptonshire's Claud Woolley; coincidentally Saint's second game, against Oxford University, also saw a hat-trick performed, this time by Oxford's Reginald Bettington.\nSaint played a number of further games in 1920, albeit with relatively little success, his highest score and indeed career best being the 36 (out of 145) he made in an innings defeat by Sussex in early August; he also had a run of useful scores of 20 or 30 later that month. 1921 saw him take his maiden wicket, that of Worcestershire's Frederick Pearson, and he finished the year with 14 wickets at 46 including a career-best 3-32 against Somerset.\nHe did not play at all in 1922, but returned for six more games the following year. However, a return of only three wickets \u2014 all against Cambridge University \u2014 at over 46 runs apiece and 88 runs in ten innings was not impressive, and the match against Yorkshire in July proved to be his last.\nSaint was born in Tollington Park, Islington, London; he died aged just 29 in Whitechapel, also in London.", "link_mentions": []}}
