He first arrived in the United States during the summer of 1876 to compete in a regatta in Philadelphia while he was the president of the Cambridge University Boat Club. Close and two brothers, Frederick and James, created a colony in Iowa called the Close Colony. They made a profit from buying public land and reselling it.
