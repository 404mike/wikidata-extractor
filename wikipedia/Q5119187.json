It was preceded by a 3 night Most Haunted Live! investigation advertised as a countdown to the series. Phil Whyman was replaced with (although he recently returned on the Live shows as a studio expert), then semi-regular, Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe. Originally O'Keeffe viewed the footage recorded during the investigations and analysed it, putting forward his own views and opinions, which usually included suggestions as to other possible causes for the phenomena encountered. He shared this role with his colleague Matthew Smith who frequently attended the early Most Haunted Live events. Following the departure of Phil Whyman after Series 4, O'Keeffe began to join the team on location. Yvette's brother Rick Fielding also left the show at the end of Series 4.", "On several occasions the former spiritualist medium Derek Acorah was supposedly possessed by an entity, sometimes evil or sometimes \"lost and confused\". Two such cases exposed Acorah. Before the filming, Acorah had been fed misinformation twice about the non-existent ghosts of Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles by the show parapsychologist Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe under instruction from Karl Beattie. During the investigations, later broadcast, Acorah presented the information as fact and even behaved as though being possessed by the fictional ghosts. O'Keeffe later revealed in the Daily Mirror that Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles were anagrams of 'Derek Faker' and 'Derek Lies'. Even though O'Keeffe exposed Acorah, the paper also claimed that O'Keeffe had exposed the rest of the Most Haunted team. O'Keeffe later reported that he had been grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the article, and produced a response outlining his version of the show based on his observations and findings, saying he had exposed Derek Acorah and not the entirety of Most Haunted. The show's presenter, Yvette Fielding, said in an interview that she believes it was a fake possession.Metro UK, \"60 SECONDS: Yvette Fielding\" by James Ellis, The UK Metro, 30 October 2006, retrieved 2 November 2006."]}, {"page": "Ciar\u00e1n", "response": ["* Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe (born 1971), English parapsychologist"]}, {"page": "O'Keeffe", "response": ["* Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe (born 1971), English psychologist specialising in parapsychology and forensic psychology"]}, {"page": "Bodmin Jail", "response": ["Series 6, Episode 1 of Most Haunted, a British-made reality TV show, saw the crew attempt their paranormal activities at the jail with presenter Yvette Fielding and medium, Derek Acorah.

Spaceman, was presented at the 2006 Liverpool Biennial. The piece was originally presented as a live performance that took place in the Small Concert Hall at St. George's Hall, Liverpool. It was based, in part, on the public s\u00e9ance act performed by Victorian entertainers The Davenport Brothers. During the performance the artists were seated on-stage inside a soundproof booth based on the Davenport's \"Spirit Cabinet\". Together they recited a single phrase into a microphone, which was fed into a machine they had created that claimed to embed the phrase as a subliminal message into the music, which was performed live by a small orchestra. The Davenport Brothers had performed their act on the same stage in 1865. The performance was introduced by Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe, a British parapsychologist who became famous after appearing as the resident skeptic on the paranormal television series Most Haunted. An installation of \"Silent Sound\" was then presented by A Foundation at Greenland Street, Liverpool. An ambisonic recording of the live performance was incorporated into a large-scale immersive installation, created in consultation with acousticians from Arup. The installation was recreated inside a shipping container in 2008 for Art Basel Miami Beach where it was described by the New York Times as \"one of the fair's biggest word-of-mouth hits\". In 2010 Silent Sound was re-presented as part of the AV Festival at Middlesbrough Town Hall."]}, {"page": "Ciaran O' Keeffe", "response": ["#redirect Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe"]}, {"page": "QED (conference)", "response": ["| QED 2011 || 5\u20136 February 2011 || Mercure Piccadilly Hotel || Part of the 10:23 Campaign.
