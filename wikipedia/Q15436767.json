Scholar Michael Rackett noted that the linkage of Pelagianism and Origenism was \"dubious\" but influential. Jerome also disagreed with Pelagius' strong view of free will. In 415, he wrote  to refute Pelagian statements. Noting  that Jerome was also an ascetic and critical of earthly wealth, historian Wolf Liebeschuetz suggested that his motive for opposing Pelagianism was envy of Pelagius' success. In 415, Augustine's emissary Orosius brought charges against Pelagius at a council in Jerusalem, which were referred to Rome for judgement. The same year, the exiled Gallic bishops Heros of Arles and Lazarus of Aix accused Pelagius of heresy, citing passages in Caelestius' . Pelagius defended himself by disavowing Caelestius' teachings, leading to his acquittal at the Synod of Diospolis in Lod, which proved to be a key turning point in the controversy.  Following the verdict, Augustine convinced two synods in North Africa to condemn Pelagianism, whose findings were partially confirmed by Pope Innocent I. In January 417, shortly before his death, Innocent excommunicated Pelagius and two of his followers. Innocent's successor, Zosimus, reversed the judgement against Pelagius, but backtracked following pressure from the African bishops.  Pelagianism was later condemned at the Council of Carthage in 418, after which Zosimus issued the  excommunicating both Pelagius and Caelestius. Concern that Pelagianism undermined the role of the clergy and episcopacy was specifically cited in the judgement."]}, {"page": "Theodosius I", "response": ["Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and one of Theodosius' many counselors, was away from court.

Not content to demolish the view that these tribes were essentially racial organizations, they relied on sociological theory that ethnicity is nothing more than a negotiated system of social classification... to deny these peoples any institutions and values of their own, and so to reduce their contribution to medieval Europe to nothing at all. Such dogmatism is easily explained as a reaction to Nazi racism but it is nevertheless extraordinarily one-sided...\" Liebeschuetz agrees with Pohl's view that the early Germanic peoples did not form a racial unit, but he opposed the increasingly popular idea among modern scholars such as Pohl that the early Germanic peoples had no single shared set of institutions or values of their own, because this idea conflicts with Liebeschuetz's belief that these peoples should be considered a single entity that made a major contribution to the emergence of Medieval Europe. John F. Drinkwater has suggested that Pohl's theories on Germanic peoples are motivated by a desire to accelerate European integration."]}, {"page": "Massacre of Thessalonica", "response": ["At some point, Ambrose was informed of events.

In these years, what remained of Germanic studies was characterized by a reaction against nationalism. Archaeological attempts to assign an identity to early Germanic peoples was deliberately avoided. The uniqueness, common northern origins and antiquity of the early Germanic peoples were called into question. The movement gained particular momentum during the 1960s. It has been strongly associated with the so-called Vienna School, which is associated with the European Science Foundation and includes prominent members such as Reinhard Wenskus, Walter Pohl, Herwig Wolfram. These scholars employed sociological theories to reject the concept of ethnicity entirely. While Wenskus earlier maintained that the early Germanic peoples held a certain core-tradition (), Pohl has later maintained that early Germanic peoples had no institutions or values of their own, and made no contribution to medieval Europe whatsoever. These views are seconded by Wolfram, who states that Germans and Scandinavians \"have as much a Germanic history\" as \"Slavic nations, Greeks, Turks and even the Tunisians and Maltese.\" Wolf Liebeschuetz has characterized the theories of the Vienna School as \"extraordinarily one-sided\" and \"dogmatism\", and its proponents as having \"a closed mind\". More recently, an even more radical group has emerged, which also employs sociological theories to deconstruct Germanic peoples, while accusing the Vienna School of being \"crypto-nationalists\". Andrew Gillett has emerged as a leading figure among these scholars. According to them, linguistic evidence and Roman and early Germanic literature is unreliable, while archaeology \"cannot be used to distinguish between peoples, and should not be used to trace migration\". They state that Germanic culture was entirely derived from the Romans, and that there was therefore no Germanic contribution to medieval Europe.\" Gillett's theories have been dismissed by Liebeschuetz as \"flawed because they depend on a dogmatic and selective use of the evidence\" and \"very strongly ideological\"."]}, {"page": "Vienna School of History", "response": ["Pohl's theories of the Germanic tribes have been criticized by Wolf Liebeschuetz as \"extraordinarily one-sided\" and a form of ideological \"dogmatism\" evincing \"a closed mind\".

Liebeschuetz also takes issue with Vienna School arguments against his notion that \"these tribes were essentially racial organizations\".", "In 2002, On Barbarian Identity, a work by scholars associated with the Toronto School and edited by Andrew Gillett, was published. In this work, the Vienna School was accused of being composed of \"crypto-nationalists\", and of enforcing \"a new historical orthodoxy\". These critics deny that the various Germanic-speaking peoples had a single set of core traditions. They consider Old Norse literature, Roman literature and other primary sources unreliable for the study of Germanic history and culture. Previous scholarship on Germanic tribes is considered by them to be politically unreliable. In their view, Germanic culture was a creation of the Roman Empire. Wolf Liebeschuetz has criticized these theories as \"very strongly ideological, deriving from the rejection of nationalism and the acceptance of multiculturalism\", and \"flawed because they depend on a dogmatic and selective use of the evidence\". Liebeschuetz contends that the proponents of these theories are motivated by a political agenda, which revolves around pan-European identity."]}, {"page": "Robert Austin Markus", "response": ["Markus took an early retirement from the University of Nottingham in 1982.
