He is a co-founder and president of the charity The Urology Foundation (TUF), vice-president of the charity Prostate Cancer UK, trustee of the King Edward VII's Hospital and as of 2020 is president of the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM), London.\nFollowing his medical education and training at the St John's College, Cambridge and Middlesex Hospital, London, and with a distinction in surgery, he took various surgical posts across England. In 1979 he gained fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. His early research involved looking at how nerves work to control the muscles used to control passing urine, findings of which disproved the then held belief that retention of urine in some women was psychological, and work that contributed to gaining his MD in 1986. In the same year, he was both elected Hunterian professor with his lecture titled \"The Investigation and Management of the Neurogenic Bladder\", and appointed consultant urologist at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He later took over from John Wickham and subsequently became one of the first urologists in the UK to perform open radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancers. In 1995, he became a professor of urology and Director of Postgraduate Education at St George's Hospital, London, and in 2005 he established The Prostate Centre in Wimpole Street, London, with the purpose of offering minimally invasive laparoscopic prostatectomy with a more holistic approach, advising on a wide range of men's health, including diet and exercise.\nAn advocate of monitoring one's own personal PSA level and having spent his surgical career researching and treating prostate cancer, he was diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer himself in 2012, and featured in the 2013 \"Tale of Four Prostates\", where he was one of four surgeons who freely discussed the diagnosis, treatment and its implications, with the aim of dispelling its surrounding taboos.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kirby (surname)", "response": ["* Roger Kirby (born 1950), British urologist and surgeon"]}, {"page": "Vanessa Kirby", "response": ["Born in Wimbledon, London to eminent urologist Roger Kirby and his wife, Kirby studied English Literature at the University of Exeter.

In 1986 they disproved the belief that retention of urine in some women was psychological or hysterical. By measuring electomyographical signals from the urethral sphincter in these women, they demonstrated that some had a neurophysical association and showed that treatment with a type of electrical stimulation therapy was effective in a significant proportion of them. The condition came to be known as Fowler's syndrome, and is named for her. She later showed that some of these women had associations with hormone imbalances and polycystic ovaries and it was later demonstrated that more than two-thirds of these women could pass urine successfully five years after treatment.
