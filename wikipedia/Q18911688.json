He soon moved to the office of another agent, Charles Roberts, and began writing songs,  His first successful comic song was \"Did You Ever See an Oyster Walk Upstairs?\", performed by Frank Roberts and by Lizzie Coote, a young actress befriended by Lewis Carroll.Gilbert set up his own business as an agent while continuing to write songs as a sideline.  In 1890, he wrote the song \"The Man That Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\", reputedly inspired by the true story of Charles Wells.  Wells was a confidence trickster who won some \u00a340,000 at the Monte Carlo casino, using the profits from earlier frauds, but was later imprisoned for obtaining money by false pretences.  Gilbert attempted to sell the song to various entertainers, but the only one interested was Charles Coborn.  He paid Gilbert \u00a310 for the rights to the song, and first sang it in late 1891. The song became a success, and Coborn continued to perform it until his death.Gilbert also wrote other successful songs, notably \"Down the Road\" (1893) for Gus Elen, and \"At Trinity Church I Met My Doom\" (1894) for Tom Costello.  However, he contracted consumption or tuberculosis, and retired to Sandgate in Kent.  He died in Elham, Kent, in 1903, aged 53.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Wells (gambler)", "response": ["Wells\u2019 exploits inspired Fred Gilbert to write a popular song, \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\".Coborn, C.: The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (pp. 227-8): (London: Hutchinson, c. 1928)thumb|Sheet music for Fred Gilbert's music hall song \"The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\"   Other people had broken the bank before Wells, but it is probable that this song played a major part in making him famous.

When Gilbert first offered the song, Coborn was reluctant to adopt it.  In his autobiography he stated: \"[I] liked the tune very much, especially the chorus, but I was rather afraid that some of the phrasing was rather too highbrow for an average music hall audience.\"  But when he found that he could not get the chorus out of his head, he changed his mind. The song became a staple of his act, and he performed it on tour in different languages throughout the world.  Coborn later estimated that he had performed the song 250,000 times in the course of his career, and could sing it in 14 languages.The Glory of Music Hall, Neil Kellas 2007  Coborn confirmed that Gilbert's inspiration was the gambler and confidence trickster Charles Wells, who was reported to have won one-and-a-half million francsThe Times, 13 July 1893 at the Monte Carlo casino, using the profits from previous fraud.Michael Kilgarriff (1998) Sing Us One of the Old Songs: A Guide to Popular Song 1860\u20131920Coborn, C.: The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (pp. 227\u20138): (London: Hutchinson, c. 1928)"]}, {"page": "Gay", "response": ["Similarly, a gay cat was a young male apprenticed to an older hobo and commonly exchanging sex and other services for protection and tutelage. The application to homosexuality was also an extension of the word's sexualized connotation of \"carefree and uninhibited\", which implied a willingness to disregard conventional or respectable sexual mores. Such usage, documented as early as the 1920s, was likely present before the 20th century, although it was initially more commonly used to imply heterosexually unconstrained lifestyles, as in the once-common phrase \"gay Lothario\", or in the title of the book and film The Gay Falcon (1941), which concerns a womanizing detective whose first name is \"Gay\".

After breakfast I wrote the verses and the melody.  The whole thing was the work of barely four hours.  I sent the song to MacDermott because he seemed to me to have just the voice and style to make It go. Ten days later he sang it from the stage of the old Pavilion in Piccadilly Circus. From that moment he was a made man. I didn't do so badly out of the song, either.  Altogether, with fees, royalties, and other charges, I netted some \u00a3750. Not bad for just on four hours' work...  \"By Jingo, If We Do: Story of a Famous Song\", The Horsham Times, Victoria, 28 March 1902, p.3  The popularity of the song had an immediate and direct effect on national policy, catching the national mood of the moment; its words were quoted in the House of Commons, and the word \"jingoism\" entered the vocabulary.  Hunt also wrote \"Charlie Dilke Upset the Milk\", sung in 1885 by Fred Gilbert and satirising Sir Charles Dilke, a Liberal politician involved in a scandalous divorce case.  "]}]}}
