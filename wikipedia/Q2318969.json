In these books Rollins develops a \"religionless\" interpretation of Christianity called pyrotheology, an interpretation that views faith as a particular way of engaging with the world rather than a set of beliefs about the world.In contrast to the dominant reading of Christianity, this more existential approach argues that faith has nothing to do with upholding a religious identity, affirming a particular set of beliefs or gaining wholeness through conversion. Instead he has developed an approach that sees Christianity as a critique of these very things. This anti-religious reading stands against the actual existing church and lays the groundwork for an understanding of faith as a type of life in which one is able to celebrate doubt, ambiguity and complexity while deepening care and concern for the world. He argues that the event which gave rise to the Christian tradition cannot itself be reduced to a tradition, but is rather a way of challenging traditions.\nIn order to explore and promote these themes Rollins has founded a number of experimental communities such as ikon and ikonNYC. These groups describe themselves as iconic, apocalyptic, heretical, emerging and failing and engage in the performance of what they call 'transformance art' and the creation of \"suspended space.\" Because of their rejection of \"worldview Christianity\" and embrace of suspended space, these groups purposefully attempt to attract people with different political perspectives and opposing views concerning the existence of God and the nature of the world.Although Rollins does not directly identify with the emerging church movement, he has been a significant influence on the movement's development.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Postmodern theology", "response": ["*Peter Rollins"]}, {"page": "Rollins", "response": ["* Peter Rollins (born 1973)"]}, {"page": "Purposeful omission", "response": ["In the book Why We Fought: America's Wars in Film and History, author Peter Rollins mentions that war movies in the US have purposely omitted some facts so as to make it acceptable to the Pentagon.

He wrote a book \u201c40 Days\u201d and a chapter is devoted to the day Angela met and ran with him. The video was fittingly filmed on the cliffs of Fairhead and in the woods of Crawfordsburn in Northern Ireland.  Josephine has a deep connection to Ireland, and Motifs and melodies from the Celtic Isles are woven throughout her entire body of work. Ditty TV, a television network that celebrates Americana and Roots styles of music, featured the video on April 30, 2018. The video was directed by Helen Rollins of Northern Ireland, who also directed Peter Rollins' short film, \"Making Love.\" When asked about the video concept, Josephine said,", "My husband and I were heading to Crawfordsburn for a C. S. Lewis event and it seemed like a waste to travel to Northern Ireland and not take advantage of such an amazing location. So, I reached out to Peter Rollins, The Northern Irish author and philosopher who was curtain the event and asked if there was anyone he could recommend for directing a music video. It felt like a. long shot, but it comes down to heeding that inner voice.
