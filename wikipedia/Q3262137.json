Thereafter, until 1892, he was a mainstay of Yorkshire County Cricket Club.\nWith George Ulyett, he formed a successful opening partnership for Yorkshire. They had eleven opening stands of over 100 and, against Sussex in 1885, they added 128 and 108 in the two innings. Against Middlesex in 1884, Hall scored 96 and 135. His finest season was 1887, when he scored 1,544 at an average of 41, 1,240 of them in first-class matches.\nHall carried his bat seventeen times in first-class cricket, a feat matched only by W. G. Grace and Cecil Wood. He played for the Players against Gentlemen five times, and captained Yorkshire a few times in the absence of the regular captain Lord Hawke.\nDefensive by nature, Hall was not an attractive batsman, with his primary shot being the front foot defence. He was awarded a benefit match against Surrey in 1890, but he deferred it so that the injured Billy Bates could have his that year. Hall's benefit match, against Surrey at Sheffield in 1891, earned him 570 pounds. After his active career ended in 1894, he served as a coach at Uppingham School.\nA steward and member of Hick Lane Wesleyan Chapel, he was also a lay preacher in the Batley area, as well being a Liberal councillor for nine years. He also helped his fellow cricketers as Chairman of the Yorkshire Cricketers Benevolent Fund. In addition, he was secretary of Batley Rugby Club, at the time of the change over to the Northern Union.\nHall died in Morecambe, Lancashire, in November 1915.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Batley", "response": ["*Louis Hall (1852\u20131915), cricketer for Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "1889 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Nine Great Batsmen of the Year \u2013 Bobby Abel, Billy Barnes, Billy Gunn, Louis Hall, Robert Henderson, Maurice Read, Arthur Shrewsbury, Frank Sugg, Albert Ward "]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Bobby Abel,  Billy Barnes,  Billy Gunn,  Louis Hall,  Robert Henderson,  Maurice Read,  Arthur Shrewsbury,  Frank Sugg,  Albert Ward"]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["In a tribute to Hawke, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack related that Hawke's \"strength of the character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\". Derek Birley commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".Birley, pp. 134\u2013135. The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\".", "Hawke's appointment as Yorkshire captain brought early success as the team enjoyed a good season in 1883 with a record of 9 wins and 5 draws in 16 inter-county matches.Webber, pp. 21\u201322. In 1884, Yorkshire won half their inter-county matches, 8 out of 16, but four defeats left them well adrift of Nottinghamshire in the unofficial championship standings. In his 1924 memoirs, Recollections and Reminiscences, Hawke described the 1884 season as \"my least successful\" and explained that militia duties had interfered with his cricket at Cambridge, for whom he made only two appearances with modest scores in both.Coldham, p. 44. With Hawke mostly absent, Louis Hall took over the captaincy.Coldham, p. 45. Hawke was even more absent in 1885 when, with Hall again leading the team, Yorkshire won seven of their 16 inter-county matches and had the second best record after Nottinghamshire, whom they defeated by an innings and 28 runs, the only match that Nottinghamshire lost.Webber, p. 22. From his first match as Yorkshire captain in August 1882, Hawke played in only nineteen out of 67 first team games between then and September 1885. The captaincy, for all intents and purposes, had gone back to the professionals with first Emmett and then Hall having taken over. Hall led the team in 37 matches through 1884 and 1885. Hawke made eight appearances for Cambridge in 1885 with a best score of 73 against MCC and he played his last match for them in June against Oxford.", "Although some people assumed that Hawke had turned his back on Yorkshire, he returned with new vigour in 1886 to begin what he himself referred to as his consistent association with the county. While Hawke had formerly been the figurehead who tossed the coin, he now took complete charge of operations and began the transformation of the team in earnest.Coldham, p. 47. The team that Hawke inherited from Emmett, which Hawke referred to as \"the boys of my old brigade\", was in decline by 1886 and several players would retire or be dismissed during the next couple of years so that, by the end of the 1887 season, it was clear that Yorkshire faced what Coldham called \"a protracted period of rebuilding\".Coldham, p. 59. Within the next seasons, the likes of Ted Peate, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Louis Hall and George Ulyett had all retired. Left arm spinner Bobby Peel, wicket-keeper David Hunter, all-rounder George Hirst, opening batsman Jack Brown and the amateurs Stanley Jackson and Ernest Smith were among the replacements who formed Yorkshire's successful teams of the 1890s and 1900s.Hodgson, p. 53."]}, {"page": "Louis hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Louis Hall "]}, {"page": "Hall (surname)", "response": ["*Louis Hall (1852\u20131915), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1889 English cricket season", "response": ["* Wisden (Nine Great Professional Batsmen) \u2013 Bobby Abel, Billy Barnes, Billy Gunn, Louis Hall, Robert Henderson, Maurice Read, Arthur Shrewsbury, Frank Sugg, Albert Ward"]}, {"page": "1883 English cricket season", "response": ["|Louis Hall || Yorkshire|| 26 || 44 || 9 || 1180 || 127 || 33.73 || 2 || 3"]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1884", "response": ["Putting the Australian performances into perspective, only eight Englishmen made 1,000 runs and only Harris scored more than Murdoch.

Seven other Englishmen managed 100 wickets in the season."]}, {"page": "David Hunter (English cricketer)", "response": ["He succeeded his brother Joe Hunter as the Yorkshire wicket-keeper at the relatively late age of 28, but was then an almost ever present player for the following two decades. It is a testament to his 'good hands' that he never suffered a serious finger injury, nor were his hands damaged at the end of his career, despite the comparatively crude equipment and heavy workload of the time.  In Louis Hall's benefit match against Surrey at Sheffield in 1891, he caught five men and stumped one in an innings, and against the same county seven years later, claimed eight of the twenty wickets, catching two and stumping six at Bradford.  He was a doughty performer right up to the end of his career, making six catches in an innings, again against Surrey, at Headingley in his last year."]}, {"page": "Willie Middlebrook", "response": ["Willie Middlebrook (23 May 1858 \u2013 26 April 1919) was an English first-class cricketer, who played seventeen matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1888 and 1889.

The opposition had 18 players and included the Yorkshire batsman Louis Hall, the lay preacher who was famously the sole teetotaller in the Yorkshire team at that time. Besides Grace himself, other noted players in the USEE team were Fred Grace, Billy Midwinter, Henry Charlwood and James Southerton. Grace took 20 wickets in the match and, batting at number six (he was habitually an opening batsman despite his status as an all-rounder), scored 22 and 73. The USEE won by 193 runs. The railways served Grace well in July and he was immediately away north to Newcastle upon Tyne for the next engagement against Eighteen of Newcastle upon Tyne, starting on Monday 15 July. The Newcastle team included Dick Barlow, Alex Watson and Arnold Fothergill so Grace may have bitten off more than he could chew. Fothergill dismissed him for 5 in the first innings after Newcastle had made a sizeable 251 (Barlow 42). The USEE were humiliatingly bowled out for 66 and had to follow on. Grace could only score 14 in a second innings total of 116 and Newcastle won the match in two days by an innings and 69 runs."]}, {"page": "History of Yorkshire County Cricket Club (1883\u20131918)", "response": ["Yorkshire to 1883 was popularly viewed as a team of gifted players with a drink problem and was sometimes described as \"ten drunks and a parson\", the odd man out being Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined the club in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for it.", "At the end of the 1889 season, several players were cut from the team, probably at the instigation of Hawke. Ellison, the Yorkshire President, named drunkenness as a factor in comments to the committee. However, the poor results seem to have been anticipated and several players made their debuts in 1889 and 1890 who would go on to be successful for the club, including Jack Brown, David Hunter and Stanley Jackson, while Bobby Peel was becoming increasingly effective as a bowling all-rounder. However, these players took time to become established and stalwarts of the team in the previous decade, such as Louis Hall and George Ulyett, were coming to the end of their careers. The additional strain of the absence of players selected for representative games meant that a slight revival in 1890 to third in the first official County Championship table, was followed by another poor season in 1891 when the team finished eighth out of nine. Criticism of the management produced \"self-defence in the annual report\" and, in 1893, the club was reorganised to properly represent the whole county. Further reorganisation came when Ellison died in 1898 and Hawke assumed the club presidency as well as captaincy; when Wostinholm retired in 1902 after being club secretary for 38 years, the county offices were moved from Sheffield to the more central location of Leeds."]}, {"page": "Frederick Aspinall", "response": ["A club cricketer for Birkenhead Park Cricket Club, Aspinall made a single first-class appearance for a combined Liverpool and District team against Yorkshire in 1892 at Aigburth Cricket Ground, Liverpool.
