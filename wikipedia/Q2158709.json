The film-maker Tony Palmer thought that Tippett's temporary ascendancy might have been a question of the two composers' contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during the final years of the 20th century. Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as \"inimitable, possessed of\u00a0... a voice and sound too dangerous to imitate\". Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became \"a phenomenal father-figure\". Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: \"He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture in the second half of the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate.\""]}, {"page": "Concerto for Orchestra", "response": ["*Concerto for Orchestra, by Robert Saxton (1984)"]}, {"page": "Oliver Knussen", "response": ["*Robert Saxton \u2013 Orchestral Works, BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Sinfonietta, Oliver Knussen, EMI Classics (1997)\t\t"]}, {"page": "In the Beginning", "response": ["* In the Beginning, Robert Saxton (born 1953)"]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Robert Saxton || 1953 ||  || British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Thomas Ad\u00e8s", "response": ["Ad\u00e8s studied piano with Paul Berkowitz and later composition with Robert Saxton at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London.
