Lancashire in particular was a common location for folk songs, including \u2018The Lancashire Miller\u2019, \u2018Warrington Ale\u2019 and \u2018The soldier\u2019s farewell to Manchester\u2019, beside several local Wassailing songs.D.

With a variety of dialects and acting as something of a crossroads for the cultures and immigrants of England, Scotland and Ireland, there is a distinctive local character to folk music, which expressed itself in local enthusiasm that emerged as a major factor within the wider folk movement in the second revival. The key event in the history of folk music in the counties of the north west of England was the Industrial Revolution, which divided the region economically and culturally into a northern, often highland and pastoral region, in Westmorland and Cumberland and a more urbanised and industrialised southern zone with large and growing conurbations like Manchester and Liverpool, where changing social and economic patterns emerged in new traditions and styles of folk song, often linked to migration and patterns of work, these included processional dances, often associated with rushbearing and the Wakes Week festivities and types of step dance, most famously clog dancing.Lancashire Folk, http://www.lancashirefolk.co.uk/Morris_Information.htm , retrieved 16/02/09. These were very different from the styles of dance that collectors like Cecil Sharp had encountered in the Cotswolds and were largely dismissed by him as contaminated by urbanisation, yet they were, and remain, a thriving tradition of music and dance. A local pioneer of folk song collection in the first half of the 19th century in Lancashire was Shakespearian scholar James Orchard Halliwell, and he was followed a little later by John Harland, William E. Axon, Thomas T. Wilkinson and Sidney Gilpin, who performed a similar service for Cumberland.J. O. Halliwell, ed., Palatine Anthology: A Collection of Ancient Poems and Ballads Relating to Lancashire and Cheshire (London: Halliwell,1850) and his Palatine Garland, being a Selection of Ballads and Fragments Supplementary to the Palatine Anthology (London: Halliwell. 1850); J. Harland, ed., Ballads and Songs of Lancashire, Chiefly Older than the Nineteenth Century (London: Whittaker & Co., 1865. 2nd edn: London: 1875); William E. A. Axon, Folk Song and Folk-Speech of Lancashire: On the Ballads and Songs of the County Palatine, With Notes on the Dialect in which Many of them are Written, and an Appendix on Lancashire Folk-Lore (Manchester: Tubbs & Brook, 1887); John Harland & Thomas Turner Wilkinson, Lancashire Folk-lore (London: F. Warne, 1867); S. Gilpin, The Songs and Ballads of Cumberland and the Lake Country, with Biographical Sketches, Notes, and Glossary (2nd ed. 3 vols. London, 1874). Most of these works, although important in unearthing, and in some cases preserving, locally relevant ballads, largely depended on manuscript sources, rather than oral collection and often did not give tunes, but only lyrics. It was not until the second folk revival that the full range of song from the region began to gain attention. The region not only produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl but also a local champion in Harry Boardman, who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the industrial folk song of the region, in several albums and books.Folk North West, , retrieved 16/02/09. The region produced no significant bands in the folk rock movement of the 1970s but can claim one of the most significant figures, as Maddy Prior was brought up in Blackpool. However, perhaps the most influential folk artists to emerge from the region in this period were folk troubadour Roy Harper and comedian and broadcaster Mike Harding.J, C.
