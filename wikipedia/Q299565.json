His work, in the 1840s on photomechanical reproduction, led to the creation of the photoglyphic engraving process, the precursor to photogravure. He was the holder of a controversial patent that affected the early development of commercial photography in Britain. He was also a noted photographer who contributed to the development of photography as an artistic medium. He published The Pencil of Nature (1844\u201346), which was illustrated with original salted paper prints from his calotype negatives, and made some important early photographs of Oxford, Paris, Reading, and York.A polymath, Talbot was elected to the Royal Society in 1831 for his work on the integral calculus, and researched in optics, chemistry, electricity and other subjects such as etymology and ancient history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Photography", "response": ["Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, had succeeded in making crude but reasonably light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative which could be used to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera.William Henry Fox Talbot (1800\u20131877) . BBC Talbot's famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, one of a number of camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.Feldman, Anthony and Ford, Peter (1989) Scientists & inventors. Bloomsbury Books, p. 128, .Fox Talbot, William Henry and Jammes, Andr\u00e9 (1973) William H. Fox Talbot, inventor of the negative-positive process, Macmillan, p. 95.", "In parallel to this development, the then largely separate interface between painting and photography was closed in the early 1970s with the work of the photo artists Pierre Cordier (Chimigramm), Chemigram and Josef H. Neumann, Chemogram.  In 1974 the chemograms by Josef H. Neumann concluded the separation of the painterly background and the photographic layer by showing the picture elements in a symbiosis that had never existed before, as an unmistakable unique specimen, in a simultaneous painterly and at the same time real photographic perspective, using lenses,  within a photographic layer, united in colors and shapes. This Neumann chemogram from the seventies of the 20th century thus differs from the beginning of the previously created cameraless  chemigrams of a Pierre Cordier and the photogram Man Ray  or L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy of the previous decades. These works of art were almost simultaneous with the invention of photography by various important artists who characterized Hippolyte Bayard, Thomas Wedgwood, William Henry Fox Talbot in their early stages, and later Man Ray and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy in the twenties and by the painter in the thirties Edmund Kesting and Christian Schad by draping objects directly onto appropriately sensitized photo paper and using a light source without a camera."]}, {"page": "Thomas Moore", "response": ["thumb|right|Moore stands centre in a photograph by William Henry Fox Talbot dated April 1844In what may be the earliest known photograph of an Irishman, Moore stands in the centre of a calotype dated April 1844.", "Moore is pictured with members of the household of William Henry Fox Talbot, the photographer.

Talbot had succeeded in producing a \"sensitive paper\" impregnated with silver chloride and capturing small camera images on it in the summer of 1835, though he did not publicly reveal this until January 1839. Talbot was unaware that Daguerre's late partner Ni\u00e9pce had obtained similar small camera images on silver-chloride-coated paper nearly twenty years earlier. Ni\u00e9pce could find no way to keep them from darkening all over when exposed to light for viewing and had therefore turned away from silver salts to experiment with other substances such as bitumen. Talbot chemically stabilized his images to withstand subsequent inspection in daylight by treating them with a strong solution of common salt."]}, {"page": "William Fox", "response": ["* Henry Fox Talbot (William Henry Fox Talbot, 1800\u20131877), pioneer of photography"]}, {"page": "Loch Katrine", "response": ["*In 1844, William Henry Fox Talbot took an early photograph of the loch, entitled Scenery of Loch Katrine."]}, {"page": "Enlarger", "response": ["thumb|Staff at William Henry Fox Talbot's commercial calotype establishment in Reading, Berkshire.

He then visited Paris to learn the waxed paper calotype process, most likely from Gustave Le Gray who had modified the methods employed by William Henry Fox Talbot, its inventor. By 1852 he had photographs exhibited in Britain, and travelled to Kiev, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and also photographed views and architecture around Britain. His published call for the setting up of a photographic society was answered in 1853 with the establishment of the Photographic Society, with Fenton as founder and first Secretary. It later became the Royal Photographic Society under the patronage of Prince Albert."]}, {"page": "Denver Art Museum", "response": ["The DAM established a dedicated curatorial department to photography in 2008.
