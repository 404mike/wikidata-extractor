It proved influential in Oxford. The Noetics were reformers but largely centrist in politics, rather than strong Whigs or Tories. One of Whately's initial acts on going to Dublin was to endow a chair of political economy in Trinity College. Its first holder was Mountifort Longfield. Later, in 1846, he founded the Dublin Statistical Society with William Neilson Hancock."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors of Ireland", "response": ["*Mountifort Longfield (1802\u20131884) "]}, {"page": "Christopher Hely-Hutchinson", "response": ["On the elevation of his brother John to the peerage as Lord Hutchinson, Hely-Hutchinson succeeded him (in 1802) in the parliamentary representation of Cork City. He held the seat for a decade, was displaced by Mountifort Longfield, and regained it six years later, retaining it to his death. On policy towards Ireland, Hely-Hutchinson followed the family line of favouring better treatment of the Irish Roman Catholics. He  criticised the refusal to fulfil the conditions of the Union; and was vehement against Lord Castlereagh. He voted in favour of Sir Francis Burdett's plan of parliamentary reform, and one of the last speeches he made was directed against emigration to Canada as a panacea for Irish distress."]}, {"page": "Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland", "response": ["*Mountifort Longfield (1863\u20131867)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Mountiford Longfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mountifort Longfield"]}, {"page": "Whately Chair of Political Economy", "response": ["*1832 Mountifort Longfield"]}, {"page": "Samuel Mountifort Longfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mountifort Longfield"]}, {"page": "Laurence S.

According to the classical theory of unemployment, unemployment is the consequence of distortions of the labour market at the low end of the salary range. A worker will be taken on by an employer so long as his or her economic value is greater than the cost of employment (which lies largely in salary costs but has other components). Distortions often operate to prevent the payment of wages lower than some fixed value with the result that potential workers whose value to their employer would be less than this are left unemployed. Removal of the distortions would eliminate the problem, but would not be socially acceptable because the lowest wage a worker could command might not be enough to avoid starvation,Mountifort Longfield, \u201cFour Lectures on Poor Laws\u201d (1834). or at least might fall below the minimum considered an acceptable standard of living."]}, {"page": "R.

He attended Sandford Park School and then Trinity College Dublin, where he read commerce alongside economics and political science; he studied under George Alexander Duncan and Charles Bastable.
