He is known for resolving the several myths of Greece and the world into idealisations of solar phenomena. The French poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 has translated some of his works under the title of Les Dieux antiques (1880).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ursa Minor", "response": ["A supposed Latin tradition of naming Ursa Minor Catuli \"whelps\" or Canes Laconicae \"Spartan dogs\", recorded in Johann Heinrich Alsted (1649, 408), is probably an early modern innovation.  George William Cox explained it as a variant of \u039b\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1, understood as \"wolf's tail\" but by him etymologized as \"trail, or train, of light\" (i.e. \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \"wolf\" vs. \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba- \"light\").

He showed zeal and energy in the performance of his duties, and owed much influence to the financial support of the S.P.G. and the S.P.C.K., which had been withdrawn from Colenso. But his want of tact alienated moderate opinion, and his fierce denunciations of Colenso's supporters widened the prevailing breach. Archbishop Benson sought in vain to reconcile the contending parties. At length in June 1883, on the death of Colenso, Benson suggested to Macrorie the propriety either of resigning or of accepting the see of Bloemfontein. But Macrorie declined to entertain the 'cowardly thought.' Macrorie's difficulties diminished on the refusal of the archbishop to consecrate either George William Cox  or William Ayerst whom the Colenso party, on their leader's death, elected to the bishopric of Natal. At length Macrorie resigned his see in 1891, and being appointed next year to a canonry in Ely Cathedral, served the diocese as assistant-bishop. He died at the College, Ely, on 24 September 1905, and was buried in the cathedral close. On 9 April 1863 he married Agnes, youngest daughter of William Watson of South Hill, Liverpool. In 1876 he was created honorary D.D. of Oxford and D.C.L. of the University of South Africa."]}, {"page": "Dictionary of Science, Literature and Art", "response": ["The original editor in chief William Thomas Brande and associate editor was Joseph Cauvin.
