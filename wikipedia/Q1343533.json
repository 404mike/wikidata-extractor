He was the son of Stephen Hislop (died 1837), a mason by occupation and an elder of the Relief Church.  Alexander's brother was also named Stephen Hislop (lived 1817\u20131863) and became well known in his time as a missionary to India and a naturalist.Alexander was born and raised in Duns, Berwickshire. He was for a time parish schoolmaster of Wick, Caithness. In 1831 he married Jane Pearson.  He was for a time editor of the Scottish Guardian newspaper.  As a probationer he joined the Free Church of Scotland at the Disruption of 1843.  He was ordained in 1844 at the East Free Church, Arbroath, where he became senior minister in 1864.  He died of a paralytic stroke in Arbroath the next year after being ill for about two years.He wrote several books, his most famous being The Two Babylons: Papal Worship Proved to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Centaur", "response": ["The Greek word kentauros is generally regarded as being of obscure origin.

Nimrod's imperial ventures described in Genesis may be based on the conquests of the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (Dalley et al., 1998, p.\u00a067). Julian Jaynes also indicates Tukulti-Ninurta I (a powerful king of the Middle Assyrian Empire) as the inspiration for Nimrod. Alexander Hislop, in his tract The Two Babylons, decided that Nimrod was to be identified with Ninus (also unattested anywhere in Mesopotamian king lists), who according to Greek mythology was a Mesopotamian king and husband of Semiramis, with a whole host of deities throughout the Mediterranean world, and with the Persian Zoroaster. The identification with Ninus follows that of the Clementine Recognitions; the one with Zoroaster, that of the Clementine Homilies, both works part of Clementine literature. There was a historical Assyrian queen Shammuramat in the 9th century, the wife of Shamshi-Adad V, whom some Assyriologists have identified with Semiramis, while others make her a later namesake of a much earlier (again, historically unattested) Semiramis."]}, {"page": "\u0112ostre", "response": ["In 1853, Scottish protestant minister Alexander Hislop published The Two Babylons, an anti-Catholic tract.
