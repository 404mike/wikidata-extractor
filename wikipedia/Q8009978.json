From the late 1970s she evolved her own East-West vocal research, influenced by travels through Africa, India, Turkey, Europe, USA and Canada. Chloe's encounters with indigenous wisdom teachers, spiritual and classical Indian music masters, led to a transformative 'no-mind' experience in Northern India, inspired by the great luminary and saint Anandamayi Ma (1896\u20131982).  This gave birth to a method of sound and voice, which Chloe eventually named The Naked Voice in 1990. Her autobiography, The Naked Voice \u2013 Journey to the Spirit of Sound tells the story of these formative early years and was published by Rider Books in 1993. Chloe Goodchild's daughter, Rebecca Hannah Goodchild Nash, is a classical and jazz pianist, performer, recording artist and jazz tutor at Stowe School, the Bristol Cathedral School and the National Youth Jazz Collective (NYJC) in England. Chloe Goodchild is related to William Goodchild, Veronica Goodchild and Gabrielle Goodchild. William Goodchild is a composer, orchestrator and conductor producing music for film, television and the concert hall. Veronica Goodchild practices as a Jungian psychotherapist. Gabrielle Goodchild is an artist producing etchings and paintings in the West Country of England."]}, {"page": "Goodchild, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Goodchild"]}, {"page": "Roni Size & Reprazent discography", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"| Live at Colston Hall(with William Goodchild and the Emerald Ensemble)"]}]}}
