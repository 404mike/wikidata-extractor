He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire.\nA Belper native, the youngster, only eighteen at the time of his debut first-class appearance in 1975, had represented the team in the Second XI Championship since the previous season. He was only able to inspire the Derbyshire team to finish third-bottom of the County Championship table in 1975, however, with the hope of changing fortunes the following season, he was only to see play in two more first-class games, and having barely turned 20, found himself out of the first-team. Glenn also briefly played for the Second XI teams of Northamptonshire and Worcestershire.\nGlenn was a lower order batsman who often found himself partnered with Test player Mike Hendrick during his short stint in the Second XI in the absence of Alan Ward.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glenn (name)", "response": ["* Michael Glenn (cricketer) (born 1956), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Michael Glenn", "response": ["Michael Glenn may refer to:", "* Michael Glenn (cricketer) (born 1956), English cricketer", "* Michael Glenn Williams (born 1957), American composer, pianist, and technologist"]}]}}
