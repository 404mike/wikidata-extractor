In the region of Traou-Perros is where Guirec chose to found his new community. \n\nHe allegedly arrived in Brittany in a stone trough pulled by angels, landing on the small beach that now bears his name.\nA shrine first built in the 12th century called L'Oratoire de Saint-Guirec (the Oratory of Saint Guirec) stands in the bay at Ploumanac'h with a chapel on the facing beach.  Female pilgrims have come for centuries to call upon the prayerful intercession of the monk saint for their seafaring husbands' safety.  Young women also come to ask Guirec's prayers that they would soon find a husband.  The tradition of putting a pin in the nose of the saint's statue is said to encourage Guirec to acquire the blessing of a marriage within one year for the young pilgrim. The 14th century wooden statue \u2013 the nose of which having consequently disappeared \u2013 was placed in the chapel and replaced by a stone statue in 1904.\nSaint Guirec is commemorated locally by the Roman Catholic Church in Brittany in conjunction with a traditional Breton Pardon ceremony on the eve of the Feast of the Ascension of Christ into heaven.  'Ascension Day' is celebrated the fortieth day after Easter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pardon (ceremony)", "response": ["Some pardons are held during notable religious festivals, such as the Feast of the Assumption on August 15. The pardons dedicated to the Virgin Mary are usually followed by those dedicated to Mary's mother Saint Anne, patron saint of Brittany. However, the majority honour local saints because of their patronage role to protect specific categories of people or activities. Thus there are pardons dedicated to Saint Gildas at the beginning of June in Tr\u00e9gor, to Saint Guirec, patron of girls about to marry, and to the patron saints of individual parishes."]}, {"page": "Ploumanac'h", "response": ["An outstanding feature of the area is the pink granite rock and sands of the C\u00f4te de Granit Rose coast. Buildings of interest are the tidal mill and the Ploumanac'h Lighthouse. The chapel of Saint Guirec faces the beach, opposite its little 12th-century oratory which is surrounded by the sea at high tide. The small chateau is not open to the public but it was the place where Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote Quo Vadis and gained himself a Nobel Prize in Literature."]}]}}
