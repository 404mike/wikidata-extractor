For example, 2005 saw the completion of the updated Ken Evans Science Building, while saw 2007 the opening of the newly created Catherine O'Neill library, named in honour of the Foundation Principal of the school. Following this in 2008, the modernised ICT Centre completed its renovation, having formerly served as an administration building. This was followed by the new Middle School Learning Community in 2009 and a raft of new classrooms including the new 'Senior Learning Centre' which was completed in 2014.", "The Catherine O'Neill Library at the Mirrabooka Campus is particularly notable for its size, boasting two floors and a collection of several thousand books. Attached to the library is the ICT centre containing two computer labs, offices, and a media room. The Matthew Hughes Performing Arts Centre has a dedicated tiered-theatre, music practice rooms, offices and an organ room. The PAC also features a dance theatre, change rooms, green room, sizable backstage area and a cafe, catering for all students and teachers. The 'Meet n' Eat Cafe' is operated by Hospitality Trainees and catering staff, and is open before and after school, as well as at recess and lunch times. The Mirrabooka gymnasium contains two full-sized basketball courts, a mezzanine level (used as a personal training area), offices, kitchens, storerooms and two classrooms. This gym is also the main assembly building on the campus and is used for large-scale events such as Founders' Day and Presentation Nights. The Ken Evans Science Building features eight 'laboratories', offices, a Laboratory room and a special open-plan laboratory for interactive science. The Middle School Learning Community features 12 classrooms, staff lounges and offices, which all span off of a spacious common area with lounges and a kitchenette. The school grounds are beautifully landscaped and buildings surround the central Carnley Court named after former Archbishop of Perth, Peter Carnley.", "In 2009, as part of the annual Founders' Day celebrations to commemorate the school's 20th year, the school's then-principal Matthew Hughes JP commissioned the creation of a statue of John Septimus Roe in his youth. The sculpture was later changed to be of Roe during the early years of his work as the Surveyor General. In 2010, the school commissioned a portrait of principal Matthew Hughes, which will set the precedent for all future principals to have a portrait painted of them to be hung in the school's library."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Kalamunda", "response": ["| Matthew Hughes"]}, {"page": "List of people from Tameside", "response": ["*Matthew Hughes (born 1950): politician, born in Audenshaw; Was the distinguished Principal of John Septamus Roe in Perth who grew the school from a small school in Mirrabooka to the largest private school in the state of WA.
