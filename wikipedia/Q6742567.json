According to Malcolm Potts, these family-planning initiatives were very successful. There were few such instances where OBA was used for development purposes up until the new millennium. Voucher-based healthcare schemes were piloted in Latin America, Asia and Africa in the 1990s and early 2000s.KFW Entwicklungsbank, \"Interview with Prof. Dr. Malcolm Potts with respect to Output-Based-Aid (OBA) voucher schemes as a means of promoting public health in developing countries.\" Available from < http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/EN_Home/Topics/Health/Interview_mit_Prof_Potts_Berkeley.pdf>", "Malcolm Potts of the University of California, Berkeley believes OBA schemes to be more effective than traditional aid projects because they invest in extant infrastructure. OBA schemes can provide poor consumers with the leverage to determine the quality of the service they are provided with. For example, in a health-care project, individuals receiving OBA will gain choice in where they want to go for their health care needs, essentially a choice between options in the public and private sector. With OBA, existing service providers are granted subsidies based on the number of people who use their services. In this way an individual can choose between multiple service providers, whether public, private or non-governmental, and only after the service has been provided do they receive the subsidy.KFW Entwicklungsbank, \"Interview with Prof. Dr. Malcolm Potts with respect to Output-Based-Aid (OBA) voucher schemes as a means of promoting public health in developing countries.\"", "OBA schemes have been criticized for their high administrative costs which exist for a number of reasons. The printing and distribution of vouchers can be costly.KFW Entwicklungsbank, \"Interview with Prof. Dr. Malcolm Potts with respect to Output-Based-Aid (OBA) voucher schemes as a means of promoting public health in developing countries  Also, there is significant cost in effectively monitoring outcomes of OBA schemes, and maintaining a process of transparency in OBA. Voucher theft or counterfeiting could be a serious issue for OBA projects. The sale on vouchers on the black market could easily disrupt the knowledge of where vouchers are distributed.Sandiford Peter, Gorter Anna and Salvetto Micol. \"Public Policy for the Private Sector: Vouchers for Health.\" Viewpoint.
