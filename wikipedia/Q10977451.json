The Bangladesh A tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost Nafees Iqbal for a duck. However, Tushar Imran made 86, and with some help from Shahriar Nafees (with 30) and Nazimuddin (27), he took the score to 185. That total did not look challenging, but that was before Syed Rasel's medium pace came to the scene. After Niall O'Brien and Neil Dexter put on 13 for the first wicket for Kent, Rasel and Shahadat Hossain dug out two wickets each, as Kent lost four wickets for two runs. Rasel took three more wickets before stumps on day one, and two more on the second morning, to end with seven for 50 - the only five-wicket-haul of Bangladesh A on the tour. However, only Shahriar Nafees passed 20 in the second innings, Tushar lost his golden touch (before this innings, he had made 455 runs at a batting average of 65) to only scamper 12 runs, while Antiguan-born Robbie Joseph took five for 19 with his pace bowling. Kent were set 188 to win, and lost wickets at regular intervals, but 54 from the first-class debutant Dexter turned out to be crucial as Kent made it with three wickets to spare."]}, {"page": "Sutton Valence School", "response": ["* Robbie Joseph, Kent cricket player"]}, {"page": "2008 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 55 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 26.05 || Robbie Joseph || Kent"]}, {"page": "List of Kent County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Robbie Joseph 55"]}, {"page": "Kent County Cricket Club in 2009", "response": ["|Robbie Joseph ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast ||", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Joseph", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Joseph", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Joseph", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Joseph", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Joseph", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Joseph"]}, {"page": "List of Leeward Islands first-class cricketers", "response": ["| 169 ||  ||  || 6 Feb. 2009 || 13 Feb. 2009 ||  ||  ||  || 14.33 || 0 || 0 ||  |||  || 46.75 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || Robbie Joseph \u2013 CricketArchive.
