In the build-up, he expressed the opinion that he did not think that Watkiss rated him as a player and that the club had treated him badly by playing him when he was not fully fit. The game, however, proved to be a disaster for Bradley when, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute, he was sent off for spitting at Mansfield defender Rhys Day; Bradley later sent a personal letter of apology to Day."]}, {"page": "Chris Smith (footballer, born 1981)", "response": ["Having been disappointed by the new contract offered to him by Tamworth, Smith agreed on 25 May 2010 to join fellow Conference Premier team Mansfield Town on a one-year contract.
