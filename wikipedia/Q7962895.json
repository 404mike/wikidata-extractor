He moved to Northamptonshire with his family when he was five years old. He returned to West Yorkshire when he started his playing with Rothwell Town, where he was their leading goal-scorer. He moved on to Kettering Town where he continued to find the net, scoring 23 goals in his third and final season. He moved on to Southern League side Northampton Town in 1904 for one season.\nHe was then signed for \u00a350 in March 1905 by Bradford City. He scored the only goal on his debut in a 1\u20130 win over Leeds City on 2 September 1905, finishing the 1905\u201306 season as top goal-scorer with 20 goals, including a goal in the 5\u20130 victory against First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup. He again topped the scoring charts for City the following season with 14 goals as City came fifth.\nIn 1907\u201308 he and Frank O'Rourke formed a lethal partnership to guide City to the Division Two title. Smith finished with 20 goals, one behind O'Rourke, including four against Chesterfield in an opening day 8\u20131 win. Smith struggled in Division One and he failed to find the net in 16 games, leaving in January 1909 for Leicester Fosse. His Leicester career lasted just six games as they finished bottom of Division One, with his former club staying up on goal average.\nInstead he moved to Hull City for the start of the 1909\u201310 season, when they narrowly missed out on promotion. Smith was forced to retire through injury in 1912 and died in his Worksop home five years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Wallace Smith||||1905\u20131909||112||54||"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wallace Smith", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wallace Smith"]}, {"page": "Frank O'Rourke (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["O'Rourke finished as top goalscorer with 21 goals in 1907\u201308, one ahead of strike partner Wallace Smith, including four in a 7\u20131 victory over Gainsborough Trinity as City won the Second Division title.
