Having recognised that training others could greatly increase his capacity to help, Nott established the David Nott Foundation, along with his wife Elly, to organise training in emergency surgery for others working in war and disaster zones.  He has been honoured for this dangerous work and is now often styled the \"Indiana Jones of surgery\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
