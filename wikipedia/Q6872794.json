As a Cambridge don, Blunt visited the Soviet Union in 1933, and was possibly recruited in 1934. In a press conference, Blunt claimed that Guy Burgess recruited him as a spy. The historian Geoff Andrews writes that he was \"recruited between 1935 and 1936\",Andrews 2015, p. 112. while his biographer Miranda Carter says that it was in January 1937 that Burgess introduced Blunt to his Soviet recruiter, Arnold Deutsch.Carter 2001, p. 179. Shortly after meeting Deutsch, writes Carter, Blunt became a Soviet \"talent spotter\" and was given the NKVD code name 'Tony'.Carter 2001, p. 180. Blunt may have identified Burgess, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, John Cairncross and Michael Straight \u2013 all undergraduates at Trinity College (except Maclean at the neighbouring Trinity Hall), a few years younger than he \u2013 as potential spies for the Soviets.Carter 2001, pp. 106\u2013107.", "In April 1945, Blunt, who had worked part-time at the Royal Library, was offered and accepted the job of Surveyor of the King's Pictures. His predecessor, Kenneth Clark, had resigned earlier that year. The Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, who had become friends with Blunt during the two years he worked in the Royal Collection, recommended him for the job. Morshead had been impressed with Blunt's \"diligence, his habitual reticence, and his perfect manners.\"Carter 2001, p. 304 (American edition). Blunt often visited Morshead's home in Windsor.Carter 2001, p. 305 (American edition). Blunt's student Oliver Millar, who would become his successor as Surveyor, said, \"I think Anthony was happier there than many other places\". Miranda Carter, Blunt's biographer, writes: \"The royal family liked him: he was polite, effective and, above all, discreet.\"Carter 2001, p. 308 (American edition).", "Miranda Carter mentions that other versions of the story, which claim that the trip was to retrieve letters from the Duke of Windsor to Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, the owner of Friedrichshof, in which the Duke knowingly revealed Allied secrets to Hitler, have some credibility, given the Duke's known Nazi sympathies.Carter 2001, p. 312 (American edition). Variants of this version have been published by several authors.Martin Allen, Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies (London: Macmillan, 2000). . Carter allows that, while George VI may have also asked Blunt and Morshead to be on the alert for any documents relating to the Duke of Windsor, \"it seems unlikely that they found any.\"Carter 2001, p. 313 (American edition). Much later Queen Victoria's letters were edited and published in five volumes by Roger Fulford, and it was revealed they contained numerous \"embarrassing and 'improper' comments about the awfulness of German politics and culture.\" Hugh Trevor-Roper remembered discussing the trip with Blunt at MI5 in the autumn of 1945 and recalled (in Carter's retelling): \"Blunt's task had been to secure the Vicky correspondence before the Americans found it and published it.\"Carter 2001, pp. 313\u2013314 (American edition).", "Based on an interview with Blunt's solicitor, Michael Rubinstein, who had met with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, Blunt's biographer Miranda Carter states that Thatcher, \"personally affronted by Blunt's immunity, took the bait. ...she found the whole episode thoroughly reprehensible, and reeking of Establishment collusion.\"Carter 2001, p. 472.

Once the platitudes are over we forget about them. Toby Harnden's remarkable book takes us into the hearts and minds of the Welsh Guards in a way that is both compelling and visceral.

His funeral and following commemorations were elaborately staged, very well attended ceremonies that redefined the role of royalty in a newly democratic nation. The people had new ways to affirm their loyalties, such as close attention to live radio broadcasts and follow-up newsreels. New ceremonies born of the commemoration of death in the Great War included the two-minute silence. Britain set up living memorials to honour and expand the king's lifelong belief in the physical, moral and social benefits of recreation and sports. The royal death thereby acted to enhance a shared Britishness. The funeral of King George VI in 1952 followed the same formula. Thereby the monarchy grew stronger and, more importantly, national cohesion was built up in the era of total war.Ina Zweiniger\u2010Bargielowska, \"Royal death and living memorials: the funerals and commemoration of George V and George VI, 1936\u201352.\" Historical Research 89.243 (2016): 158\u2013175."]}, {"page": "Carter, Miranda", "response": ["#REDIRECT Miranda Carter "]}, {"page": "Dunedin Writers & Readers Festival", "response": ["The 2017 event ran from 9 May to 14 May.
