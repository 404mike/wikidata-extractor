He gained initial prominence in the 1980s as the host of The James Whale Radio Show on Radio Aire in Leeds, which was simulcast on national television. From 1995 to 2008, Whale hosted a night time radio show on talkSPORT (Talk Radio 1995\u20132000), followed by stints on LBC 97.3 and various BBC radio stations.\nWhale is the current host of his podcast The James Whale Show and a night time radio show on talkRADIO.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Whale", "response": ["James Whale (22 July 1889\u00a0\u2013 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theatre director and actor, who spent the greater part of his career in Hollywood. He is best remembered for several horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical Show Boat.", "James Whale lived as an openly gay man throughout his career in the British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in that era. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go out of his way to publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, \"Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay.\" While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia,Bryant, p. 46.Russo, pp. 50\u201351. and Whale was supposedly dubbed \"The Queen of Hollywood\",Benshoff, p. 41. Harrington states that \"nobody made a thing out of it as far as I could perceive\".", "However, Harrington dismisses this as \"a younger critic's evaluation. All artists do work that comes out of the unconscious mind and later on you can analyze it and say the symbolism may mean something, but artists don't think that way and I would bet my life that James Whale would never have had such concepts in mind.\" Specifically in response to the \"majesty and power\" reading, Harrington states \"My opinion is that's just pure bullshit. That's a critical interpretation that has nothing to do with the original inspiration.\" He concludes, \"I think the closest you can come to a homosexual metaphor in his films is to identify that certain sort of camp humor.\"", "Horror in Hollywood: The James Whale Story, a retrospective of Whale's artwork, opened at the Dudley Museum and Art Gallery in October 2012 and ran through to January 2013.", "* Curtis, James (1998).
