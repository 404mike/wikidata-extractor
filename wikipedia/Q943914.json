Yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread, it is \"reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots\". Justin London writes that musical metre \"involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time\". The \"perception\" and \"abstraction\" of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into \"tick-tock-tick-tock\"."]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["The series which centres on the character of Geraldine Granger, the new vicar of the village of Dibley,  almost immediately exploited the 1992 changes in the Church of England that permitted the ordination of women.
