His first task was to prevent a poor Stoke side slipping into the Third Division in 1960\u201361, achieving this by a mere three points. He brought in a defensive tactic to adverse Stoke's slide which became known as 'Waddington's Wall'. But Waddington knew that this wouldn't bring back the crowds back to the Victoria Ground and so he decided something needed to be done. He pulled off a master stroke after paying \u00a33,000 to Blackpool for the returning 46-year-old Stanley Matthews. Crowds instantly arrived in large numbers with Matthews first match back against Huddersfield Town more than 35,000 turned up a good 15,000 more than the last home match.
