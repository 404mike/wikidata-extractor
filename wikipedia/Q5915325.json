They had not received compensation from the drug manufacturers, who in the United Kingdom were the Distillers Company. He organized a campaign by the newspaper's Insight investigative team, appointing Phillip Knightley to run the investigation.  Evans took on the drug companies responsible for the manufacture of thalidomide, pursuing them through the English courts and eventually gaining victory in the European Court of Human Rights in 1979. The British government was compelled to change the law on contempt of court which had inhibited the reporting of civil cases. While it was legal for the newspaper to campaign, it was not possible for the journalists to report its factual basis. After the ruling in the European Court, the British media was now able to report such cases without restraint. The families of thalidomide victims eventually won compensation of \u00a332.5\u00a0million as a consequence of Evans' Sunday Times campaign.

He indicates that the information was delivered very promptly (often within 24 hours) to Moscow, too fast if it had come via GCHQ Bletchley Park. Further, Ultra intelligence on the Eastern front was less than complete; many of the German messages were transmitted by landlines and wireless messages were often too garbled for timely decoding. Furthermore, the Enigma systems employed by German forces on the Eastern Front were only broken intermittently. Knightley suggests that the source was Karel Sedlacek, a Czech military intelligence officer. Sedlacek died in London in 1967 and indicated that he received the information from one or more unidentified dissidents within the German High Command. Another, but less likely possibility Knightley suggests is, that the information came from the Swiss secret service."]}, {"page": "William Vestey, 1st Baron Vestey", "response": ["* Phillip Knightley The Rise and Fall of the House of Vestey, on the business empire established by William Vestey in 1897;"]}, {"page": "Center for Public Integrity", "response": [" Its website publishes The Global Muckraker.

After the war Charteris allegedly claimed in a public speech that he invented it when he deliberately switched captions on two German war pictures: one image showed soldiers killed in battle being taken away for burial, while the other showed horse carcasses being delivered to a processing factory behind German lines. One of his subordinates created a fake diary describing the use of the factory. This was to have been planted on the corpse of a German soldier, to be \"found\" as proof of the story, but this plan was eventually dropped. Charteris's comments caused a media outcry.\"Candid Charteris\" in Time 1925 Phillip Knightley says that all the evidence suggests that the story originated in newspaper reports about a real factory for rendering animal corpses.
