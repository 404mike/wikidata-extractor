After returning to London, he took a postgraduate course at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. His first job was as assistant arranger with record producer Norrie Paramor. While there, here worked with Cliff Richard, the Shadows, Sacha Distel and many more. During this time he composed many library music tracks and the theme tune to BBC TV series Keeping Up Appearances.

He conducted the orchestra for the song chosen by viewers \"Long Live Love\" at the contest staged in Brighton, UK, where it placed 4th. Going freelance in the mid-1970s, Ingman worked consistently with such artists as Diana Ross, Enrique Iglesias, the Pet Shop Boys, Queen and Tina Turner. He was also employed by a large number of American radio stations to provide easy listening tracks for their networks, scoring over 300 tracks every year. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ingman continued his work with major acts such as Radiohead, Oasis, Annie Lennox, Bj\u00f6rk, David Bowie, Elton John, Eric Clapton and Atticus Ross with whom he toured around the USA.\nDuring this time, Ingman worked regularly with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

He has been nominated for a Grammy three times for his work with Eric Clapton, Sade Adu and a recording of West Side Story with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.There is evidence on discog which indicates that Nick Ingman was also involved in the 1973 album Moody a set of instrumental covers of then popular songs such as \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"You Are The Sunshine of My Life\" released under the name The Gentle Rain (aka Gentle Rain).
