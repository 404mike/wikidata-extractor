In the early seventeenth century, John Donne wrote \"Sapho to Philaenis\", returning to the idea of Sappho as a hypersexual lover of women. The modern debate on Sappho's sexuality began in the 19th century, with Welcker publishing, in 1816, an article defending Sappho from charges of prostitution and lesbianism, arguing that she was chaste \u2013 a position which would later be taken up by Wilamowitz at the end of the 19th and Henry Thornton Wharton at the beginning of the 20th centuries. In the nineteenth century Sappho was co-opted by the Decadent Movement as a lesbian \"daughter of de Sade\", by Charles Baudelaire in France and later Algernon Charles Swinburne in England. By the late 19th century, lesbian writers such as Michael Field and Amy Levy became interested in Sappho for her sexuality, and by the turn of the twentieth century she was a sort of \"patron saint of lesbians\"."]}, {"page": "Kenilworth", "response": ["*Edith Emma Cooper (1862\u20131913) was one half of Michael Field, known as a poet, dramatist and diarist."]}, {"page": "Ekphrasis", "response": ["Other examples of the genre from the nineteenth century include Michael Field's 1892 volume Sight and Song, which contains only ekphrastic poetry; Algernon Charles Swinburne's poem \"Before the Mirror\", which ekphrasises James Abbott McNeill Whistler's Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl, hinted at only by the poem's subtitle, \"Verses Written under a Picture\"; and Robert Browning's \"My Last Duchess\", which although a dramatic monologue, includes some description by the duke of the portrait before which he and the listener stand."]}, {"page": "Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892\u20131935", "response": ["*Michael Field"]}, {"page": "Michael Field", "response": ["Michael Field may refer to:", "* Michael Field (politician) (born 1948), Premier of Tasmania", "* Michael Field (author), pseudonym of Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper ", "* Michael Field (physician) (1933 \u2013 2014), American gastroenterologist", "*Michael Field (food writer) (1915\u20131971) American author and critic", "* Michael Fields, American TV director, writer and producer"]}, {"page": "Ernest Rhys", "response": ["In 1887 Rhys met W.

His woodcut illustrations \"often incorporated the swirling lines of Art Nouveau and androgynous figures\". The Vale Press, which existed between 1896 and 1904, published more than eighty volumes, mostly reprints of English poetic classics, and earned a reputation as \"one of the big six amongst modern presses\". Initially, Ricketts financed the Vale publications by inviting subscriptions, but in 1894 its finances were put on a more secure footing when he was introduced to a rich barrister, William Llewellyn Hacon, who invested \u00a31,000 and became Ricketts's business partner in the firm. A fire at the printers in 1904 destroyed the press's woodcuts, and Ricketts and Shannon decided to abandon publishing and turn to other work.
