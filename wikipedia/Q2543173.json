Smith made his first start on his home debut at Loftus Road in a 3\u20133 draw with Norwich City, a game in which he scored QPR's first goal of the match midway through the first-half. He scored again three days later, on 17 October 2006, hooking in a volley from a corner to briefly restore parity in a match QPR would go on to lose 2\u20131 to Derby County, subsequently ending their unbeaten run. After impressing during his month at QPR, his loan deal was extended by a further two months, with QPR manager John Gregory saying \u2014 \"His professionalism is second to none and it is rubbing off on all the other lads in the squad. He's uncomplicated, goes about his job in the right manner and will only go from strength to strength. We feel very honoured to have a player of his class and potential at the club\". Shortly after the loan extension, Smith went on to score three times within the space of a week; firstly netting a brace in a 4\u20132 home victory over Crystal Palace, before poking in Lee Cook's free-kick in a 3\u20132 away win at Luton Town. His loan deal at QPR was later extended in December 2006, for the remainder of the season. Smith played regularly during the second half of the campaign, scoring one further goal, the only goal of the game in a 1\u20130 victory over Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena in April 2007.
