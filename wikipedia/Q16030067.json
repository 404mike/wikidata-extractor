She made her stage debut in London at an early age and found success in New York and San Francisco not long afterwards. Lee may have first starred in Jo around 1874 during her tenure at San Francisco's California Theatre, but her real success came with the play's London debut on 22 February 1876 at the Globe Theatre in Newcastle Street. Jo ran for many months at the Globe and other London venues before embarking for several seasons on tours of the British Isles, a return to North America, tours of Australia and New Zealand and later revivals in Britain. Reduced circumstances over her final years forced Lee to seek assistance from an actor's pension fund subsidised in part by proceeds from Royal Command Performances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Lee", "response": ["* Jennie Lee (American actress), American stage and silent film actress", "* Jennie Lee (British actress), British stage actress"]}, {"page": "Jennifer Lee", "response": ["Jennifer, Jenny, or Jennie Lee may refer to:", "* Jennie Lee (American actress) (1848\u20131925), American stage and silent film actress", "* Jennie Lee (British actress) (1854\u20131930), British stage actress", "* Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge (1904\u20131988), British politician and life peer", "* Jennie Lee (dancer) (1928\u20131990), American stripper, burlesque entertainer and actress", "* \"Jennie Lee\" (song) by Jan and Arnie"]}, {"page": "Jennie Lee (American actress)", "response": ["Mary Jane Lee (September 4, 1848 \u2013 August 5, 1925), known professionally as Jennie Lee, was an American actress of the stage and screen."]}, {"page": "Jennie Lee (stage actor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jennie Lee (British actress)"]}, {"page": "Jennie Lee (stage actress)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jennie Lee (British actress)"]}, {"page": "Charles Cartwright", "response": ["He spent the following year travelling around England in search of acting and singing engagements to develop his stage skills.
