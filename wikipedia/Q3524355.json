He progressed to the Second XI by 1970 and in 1972 made his first-class debut against Somerset. He was a right-handed batsman, who usually opened for Derbyshire, and an occasional off-break bowler. In first-class cricket, he hit 65 fifties and 18 hundreds, giving him a career average of 30.89. His occasional off-break bowling took only a modest 9 wickets.\nHill is one of only two cricketers to make a century without hitting a boundary, a record that he shares with Paul Hibbert, making 103 in the match for Orange Free State v Griqualand West in 1976-77.After he retired Hill became an umpire at first-class and List A level, but stopped after only two seasons. He began coaching cricket, working in many schools, and until the end of the 2009 season, was head coach for Newcastle-under-Lyme School.His brother, Bernard Hill, made several appearances for the Derbyshire Second XI, but never made it to first-class level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Graham Roope", "response": ["It is often said,For example, in Wisden in 1977, and in his obituaries in The Times, and The Independent that Roope was at the non-striking end when both John Edrich, and later Geoff Boycott, reached their 100th centuries in first-class cricket in 1977. Although the second is certainly correct, achieved at 5.49pm on the first day of the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley on 11 August, when Roope had to take evasive action to avoid a straight-hit four off the bowling of Greg Chappell to bring up Boycott's century,Stump The Bearded Wonder No 76, BBC, 3 June 2004; Scorecard from CricketArchive. a close inspection of the record books indicates that Roope had swapped batting positions with Geoff Howarth, for the match against Derbyshire at The Oval on 12 July, and Howarth was at the crease when Edrich scored the necessary runs off the bowling of Alan Hill, shortly after play should have ended at 5:30pm on the third and final day.Stump The Bearded Wonder No 82, BBC, 31 August 2004; Stump The Bearded Wonder No 83, BBC, 18 September 2004; Stump The Bearded Wonder No 84, BBC, 5 October 2004; Scorecard from CricketArchive."]}, {"page": "Paul Hibbert", "response": ["Hibbert is one of only two men to make a century in first-class cricket without hitting a boundary, a record he shares with Alan Hill.
