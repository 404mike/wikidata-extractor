He studied cello at the Royal College of Music, and became professor of cello at the Royal College and Guildhall schools of music.  He was principal cello in several major London orchestras and helped to popularize the cello as a solo instrument in the early years of the 20th century by giving public concerts throughout the British Isles and making recordings; he became well known for his performances of the Elgar and Saint-Sa\u00ebns cello concertos. In 1898 the French composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9 dedicated his cello piece Sicilienne to Squire. Squire's own compositions were written mainly for the cello; these included several solo pieces of light character and a cello concerto; he also wrote the music for a number of songs.\nOne of Squire's legacies is a collection of student-level works for cello and piano which appear in string teaching syllabuses all over the world including those of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the Internet Cello Society and the Suzuki method of string instrument teaching.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kingsbridge", "response": ["* William Henry Squire (1871\u20131963), composer, was educated in Kingsbridge."]}, {"page": "Ross-on-Wye", "response": ["*William Henry Squire (1871\u20131963), Royal Academy of Music member, cellist, composer and music professor"]}, {"page": "List of cellists", "response": ["*William Henry Squire (1871\u20131963, England)"]}, {"page": "W.
