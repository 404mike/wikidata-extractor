He was professor of ancient history at the University of Cambridge from 1985 to 2000.\nHopkins had a relatively unconventional route to the Cambridge professorship. After Brentwood School, he graduated in classics at King's College, Cambridge in 1958. He spent time as a graduate student, much influenced by Moses Finley, but left before completing his doctorate for an assistant lectureship in sociology at the University of Leicester (1961\u20131963).\nHopkins returned to Cambridge as a research fellow at King's College, Cambridge (1963\u20131967) while at the same time taking a lectureship at the London School of Economics, before spending two years as professor of sociology at Hong Kong University (1967\u20131969) After a further two years at the LSE (1970\u201372), he moved to Brunel University as professor of sociology in 1972, also serving as dean of the social sciences faculty from 1981 to 1985. He is most famed for Conquerors and Slaves, whereas he argued that ancient historians need not submit to the sources they studied, but rather demanded they be questioned and understood within their larger context of interaction. His rethinking of traditionalist methodology, and famed disagreement with traditionalist Millar, makes him one of the most influential twentieth-century ancient historians.\nIn 1985 Hopkins was elected to the Cambridge chair in ancient history. The fullest account of his career and significance as an ancient historian is in his British Academy necrology (W. V. Harris, Proceedings of the British Academy, 130 (2005), 3\u201327).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Keith Hopkins (1934\u20132004), ancient"]}, {"page": "Brentwood School, Essex", "response": ["*Keith Hopkins (1934\u20132004), influential historian and sociologist, Professor of Ancient History at the University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Keith Hopkins (1934\u20132004) - Roman history"]}, {"page": "Hopkins", "response": ["* Keith Hopkins, historian and sociologist"]}, {"page": "2004 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Keith Hopkins, sociologist and historian (born 1934)"]}, {"page": "Salakta", "response": ["The town was a portPeter Garnsey, Keith Hopkins, C.

Slaves were the main source of labor. In Roman society, there were three main ways to obtain a slave. The first and possibly most common way to gain a slave was to buy one on the market. Slaves were purchased at auctions and slaves markets from dealers or were traded between individual slave owners. Another way slaves were acquired was through conquest in warfare. As Keith Hopkins explains in his writings, many landowners would go to war and bring back captives. These captives were then taken back to Roman territory and either sold to another citizen or made to work on the capturer's farm. The final way a slave could be obtained was through birth: if a female slave gave birth to a child, that child became property of the slave's owner. Extramarital relations with women who were not citizens was not considered to be adultery under Roman law (and Roman wives were expected to tolerate such behavior), so there was no legal or moral impediment to having children being fathered by a slave's owner or overseer."]}, {"page": "Mary Beard (classicist)", "response": ["*The Colosseum (with Keith Hopkins, Harvard University Press, 2005); "]}, {"page": "Roman economy", "response": ["The Roman Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called \"our sea\" (mare nostrum).Kevin Greene, The Archaeology of the Roman Economy p. 17.

The in-kind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel, animals, or vehicles for the cursus publicus, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into a village or trading post.Stambaugh, The Ancient Roman City, p. 253. A mansio (plural mansiones) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus. The support staff at such a facility included muleteers, secretaries, blacksmiths, cartwrights, a veterinarian, and a few military police and couriers. The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Mules were the animal most often used for pulling carts, travelling about 6.4\u00a0km/h.Ray Laurence, \"Land Transport in Roman Italy: Costs, Practice and the Economy,\" in Trade, Traders and the Ancient City (Routledge, 1998), p. 129.

The data to calculate the figures are nearly non-existent, but the historian and sociologist Keith Hopkins has given crude and tentative estimates for the Christian population in the 3rd century. Hopkins estimates that the Christian community grew from a population of 1.1 million in 250 to a population of 6 million by 300, about 10% of the empire's total population.Hopkins, 191. Christians even expanded into the countryside, where they had never been numerous before.Frend, \"Prelude\", 2. Churches in the later 3rd century were no longer as inconspicuous as they had been in the first and second. Large churches were prominent in certain major cities throughout the empire.Keresztes, 379; Lane Fox, 587; Potter, 314. The church in Nicomedia even sat on a hill overlooking the imperial palace.Keresztes, 379; Potter, 314. These new churches probably represented not only absolute growth in Christian population, but also the increasing affluence of the Christian community.Keresztes, 379.

Stark asserts 3.4% per year while Keith Hopkins uses what he calls \"parametric probability\" to reach 3.35% annual growth, recognizing this would not have been steady but would have varied. Keith Hopkins adds that rapid growth in absolute numbers occurred only in the third and fourth centuries. ", "According to cultural anthropology, people of the ancient world had a 'collectivist view' where the welfare of the group had priority over the individual. Keith Hopkins concludes that, \"by the time the Roman government finally began to realize that Christianity posed a significant threat, and started systematic persecution of Christian leaders and their property (in 250\u201351 under Decius, in 257\u201360 under Valerian, after 303 under Diocletian), Christianity was too embedded to be stamped out easily. And it was particularly in this period of persecutions, in spite of temporary losses, that Christianity grew fastest in absolute terms. In other words, in terms of number, persecution was good for Christianity\".", "Koester asserts that \"the Christian community in the letters of Paul, begins with a baptismal formula, which says in Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither male nor female, neither slave nor free. This is a sociological formula that defines a new community\u00a0... [giving] even the lowliest slave personal dignity and status\". Keith Hopkins points out that real communities of real people would have diverged from the Christian ideal even though the ideal would have influenced practices. Wayne Meeks asserts that evidence from Pliny the Younger and others demonstrates that early Christian communities were, in fact, highly inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories, much more so than were the Roman voluntary associations. From the beginning, the Pauline communities cut across the social ranks. This deliberate breaking of rank was imposed by Paul the Apostle. His understanding of the meaning of the Crucifixion of Jesus and the paradox of Christ created a new order unprecedented in classical society."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Academics of the University of Cambridge", "response": ["Keith Hopkinsnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Angus Maddison", "response": ["In the past two decades, Maddison mainly focussed on the construction of data and analysis further back in time.
