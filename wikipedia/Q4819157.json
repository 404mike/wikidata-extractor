Bell found that the slope on which the Long Man was cut had gone through a period of instability in this time, after a very long prior period of stability, suggesting that the figure was first cut then.

Specifically they supported Dietz's (Nature 1961) idea that sea floor spreading was occurring at mid-ocean ridges. Vine and Matthews showed that basalt created at a mid-ocean ridge records earth's current magnetic field polarity (and strength), thus turning Hess's theoretical 'conveyor belt' into a 'tape recorder'. Furthermore, they showed that magnetic reversals 'frozen' into these rocks, as suggested by Allan Cox (Nature 1963), can be seen as parallel strips as you travel perpendicularly away from the ridge crest."]}, {"page": "Strode's College", "response": ["*Aubrey Manning, zoologist and broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Science Week Ireland", "response": ["The guest lecturers include Professor Aubrey Manning, distinguished zoologist and broadcaster; Gerry Johnston, director of Special Effects Ireland;  Dr. Cynthia Breazeal, Associate Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Stephen Attenborough of Virgin Galactic; and Patrick Collison, Irish Young Scientist of the Year winner 2005.
