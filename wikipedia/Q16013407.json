I have worked five days a week, 50 weeks a year, for over 30 years, as a novelist and poet. I set myself rather high standards: that unless the story is at once as unputdownable to a taxi driver as to a university professor, it is not good enough; that unless a novel is, at the end, quite clearly an epic poem, as well as a story, it is not good enough. My work has resulted in the publication of eight novels by 16 publishers, now adding up to 22 editions.
