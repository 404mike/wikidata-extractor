He later acknowledged that it had been a mistake to return to Brighton, and that he should have instead sought a fresh opportunity elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Joey Barton", "response": ["On 2 January 2012, Barton scored the opening goal in QPR's match against Norwich City, his second for the club. He was later given a straight red card after head-butting Norwich midfielder Bradley Johnson. With QPR down to ten men they went on to lose the match 2\u20131. When Warnock was replaced as manager by Mark Hughes in January 2012, Hughes confirmed that Barton would remain captain. Barton's performance in QPR's 3\u20132 home victory against Liverpool saw him booed by QPR fans, who promptly cheered when he was substituted just after the hour mark. Barton admitted that his performance was \"awful\" and the \"worst I've ever played in my career\" but also criticised the QPR fans for not sticking with the team in their battle against relegation. After being dropped for the club's next match, an away defeat to Sunderland, he returned to the line-up for the home match against Arsenal.

Faye struggled to get back into the team due to the form of Bradley Johnson. On 1 January 2011, manager Simon Grayson revealed that Faye might get a new contract despite not playing many games. However, on 12 January, Faye's six-month contract was not renewed and he left the club."]}, {"page": "Giles Coke", "response": ["Coke remained on the sideline at the start of the season after having a further operation. In early October, Coke was showing signs of recovery and of being fully fit to make a return to training. To gain match fitness, Coke played his first for Northampton Town in reserve for 56 minutes, as they beat Southend United, which met the delight of the club's reserve coach Ian Sampson, who believed \"his confidence will be sky high at the moment.\" Despite potential debut after playing in the reserves, his league debut was delayed once again when he sustained a groin injury and would be out for three weeks following an operation. After being on the sideline, Coke made his debut for the club, coming on for Andy Kirk in the 58th minutes and was booked, as Northampton Town lost 3\u20132 to Leeds United on 5 January 2008. Since his debut, Coke quickly made an impact and insists he was not a \"next Bradley Johnson.\" Coke scored his first goal for the club, in a 2\u20130 win over Leyton Orient on 25 January 2008.

Robinson scored his first goal of the season for Leeds in the Football League Trophy game against Darlington, scoring a freekick with the help of a deflection. Robinson has struggled to even get a place on the bench for Leeds, with him struggling with fitness issues, and the arrival of on loan wingers Max Gradel and Hogan Ephraim who are all ahead of him in the pecking order, with the likes of Robert Snodgrass, Bradley Johnson and Jonathan Howson all guaranteed starters.

Snodgrass returned from suspension for Leeds against Ipswich Town, replacing Luciano Becchio in the starting lineup and scored his first goal of the season. He scored his second goal of the season with a curled effort against Coventry City. His performance against Coventry was welcomed as a return to form by Snodgrass.

He scored again on 23 February 2014 against Tottenham after a cutting through ball from Bradley Johnson, holding off the defender and placing it past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris from just inside the box. That goal turned out to be the only goal, as Norwich won 1\u20130."]}, {"page": "Jonny Howson", "response": ["In the summer of 2011, Howson was made permanent club captain, replacing the departed Richard Naylor. Howson's long-term midfield teammates Neil Kilkenny and Bradley Johnson also left the West Yorkshire club, with Player of the Year Max Gradel joining the exodus on the deadline day of the Summer transfer window, as Ken Bates once again emphasised the need for prudence, much to the anger of the fanbase. Howson's first game as official captain of Leeds came on the opening day of the season as Leeds suffered a 3\u20131 defeat against Southampton. He picked up his second career red card in the next league game versus Middlesbrough as United lost 0\u20131. Despite the loss of several key players and their slow start to the season, United recovered to remain competitive for much of the first half of the season; regularly stationed in the play-off zone. On 29 November, Howson scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20130 away victory over Nottingham Forest in what was an emotionally charged affair, coming only two days after the death of Leeds legend Gary Speed. In the following game, Howson picked up a knee injury against Millwall in what would prove to be his last match for the club. The injury was suspected to keep Howson out of football for several months and he did not feature for his boyhood club again before he was sold to Premier League Norwich City in late January 2012."]}]}}
