He played jazz piano while still at school. In 1962 he went to Durham University to study mathematics. In 1965 he moved to London to  play with Bill Nile's Delta Jazz Band and with Monty Sunshine (1968). He was also playing on rock sessions with The Yardbirds, David Bowie, Cat Stevens, Kevin Coyne and was the keyboardist on two songs included as part of the debut album of Uriah Heep. Wood, whose other musical talents also include playing the flute, did not, however (although offered the job), become an official member of the band. He lectured in maths for a time while freelancing musically. In September 1977 he joined Acker Bilk and remained with him into the 2000s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Incus Records", "response": ["|Radu Malfatti, Ian Brighton, Phil Wachsmann, Colin Wood, Frank Perry ", "|, Roger Smith, Nigel Coombes, Colin Wood"]}, {"page": "Uriah Heep (band)", "response": ["Spice avoided playing covers and, according to Box, always strove \"...to do something original.\" Managed initially by Newton's father, the band climbed their way up to The Marquee level, then got signed by Gerry Bron (the Hit Record Productions Ltd.'s boss) who saw the band at the Blues Loft club in High Wycombe. \"I thought they were a band I could develop and I took them on that basis,\" remembered Bron later. He became the band's manager and signed them to Vertigo Records, the newly formed Philips label. The four-piece found themselves booked into the Lansdowne Studios in London, still under the name of Spice. Then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from David Copperfield, Uriah Heep (for, according to biographer Kirk Blows, \"Dickens' name being everywhere around Christmas '69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death\"). According to Dave Ling's 2001 autobiography of the band, Wizards and Demons, The Uriah Heep Story, though the \"Uriah Heep\" moniker was chosen in December 1969, the band continued to play gigs as \"Spice\" until Ken Hensley joined in February 1970. Uriah Heep then decided to widen the sound. \"We'd actually recorded half the first album when we decided that keyboards would be good for our sound. I was a big Vanilla Fudge fan, with their Hammond organ and searing guitar on top, and we had David's high vibrato vocals anyway so that's how we decided to shape it,\" Box recalled. Gerry Bron brought in session player Colin Wood, followed by Hensley, a former colleague of Newton in the Gods, who was then playing guitar in Toe Fat. \"I saw a lot of potential in the group to do something very different,\" remembered Hensley."]}, {"page": "Space Oddity", "response": ["The first full studio version of \"Space Oddity\", which was for Love You till Tuesday, was recorded on 2 February 1969 at Morgan Studios, London. At this point, the lyrics were finalised. The session was produced by Jonathan Weston; Bowie and Hutchinson were joined by Colin Wood on Hammond organ, Mellotron and flute; Dave Clague on bass and Tat Meager on drums. As in the early demos, Bowie and Hutchinson shared lead vocals, with Bowie voicing Major Tom's dialogue and Hutchinson singing Ground Control's lines. Bowie also played an ocarina solo for this recording, which Hutchinson later called \"just silly\". According to Pegg, this version is significantly inferior to the David Bowie recording."]}, {"page": "Spice (British band)", "response": ["Spice were a British pop rock and rhythm and blues band featuring David Byron (vocals), Mick Box (guitar), Paul Newton (bass guitar), Alex Napier (drums) and Colin Wood (keyboards).
