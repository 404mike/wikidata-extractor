He is best remembered for his writings on British anti-invasion preparations of the Second World War, his most often cited work being Pillboxes: A Study of U.K. Defences, 1940. His interest in the topic was triggered when, in 1968, as a photographer for the Salisbury Times, he was sent on a journalistic assignment to photograph the demolition of a pillbox. His inquiries led him to conclude that there were few official records of Britain's wartime defences.\nAfter some further investigation and some publicity on radio and in newspapers, he planned and organised the first nationwide survey of Britain's WW2 defences. With the help of many volunteers, more than 5,000 defence sites were recorded.The value of Henry Wills' work was acknowledged by the British Archaeological Trust and the British Broadcasting Corporation which awarded him the Chronicle Award in 1979. After 15 years of work, he published Pillboxes in 1985.\nWills' work stimulated the interest of many enthusiasts and academics including local historians and former soldiers. Their interest was given further impetus by the realisation that these under-appreciated remains were disappearing at an alarming rate \u2013 mostly because of demolition to make way for new developments. A project to make a comprehensive survey of all 20th-century defence works throughout the UK was formed. Between April 1995 and December 2001 the Defence of Britain Project, with funds from the national Heritage Lottery Fund, compiled thousands of records. The project also resulted in the discovery of many previously unsuspected contemporary records.Wills' papers now comprise the Henry Wills Collection at the Historic England Archive in Swindon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British hardened field defences of World War II", "response": ["Extant wartime records were thought to be fairly poor, and nobody could be sure how many pillboxes and related hardened field defences had survived\u2014or indeed, how many had been constructed in the first place. In the late 1970s, journalist Henry Wills began research on the topic, eventually publishing Pillboxes: A Study of UK Defences in 1985. Interest was stimulated, both public and professional, and local surveys were carried out. These surveys culminated in the Defence of Britain Project, which took place from 1995 to 2002, attempting to record all known military defence sites.Denison, 2002. From this and other surveys, it is estimated that some 28,000 pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications were constructed in the United Kingdom, of which about 6,500 still survive. The project also resulted in the discovery of many relevant records."]}, {"page": "Henry Wills", "response": ["Henry Wills may refer to:", "* Henry Wills (writer) (born 1930), British journalist, photographer and writer on local history and archaeology", "* Henry Wills (Medal of Honor) (1842\u2013?), United States Army soldier and Medal of Honor recipient", "* Henry Wills (actor)", "* Henry Wills (MP)"]}]}}
