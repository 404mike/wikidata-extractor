Mycroft Holmes has been the subject of several efforts: Enter the Lion by Michael P. Hodel and Sean M.

According to DWM editor Tom Spilsbury, it hadn't occurred to him before that he was anything other than being alive, and that \"it might come down to semantics over what being alive means\". Doctor Who scriptwriter Gareth Roberts believed that Rassilon is dead and the face that appears is \"a clever AI\". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies believed that Rassilon is \"clearly alive\", with his big face in the story being \"A projection from the Matrix. A mental life extending beyond the body's death.\" Spin-off writer George Mann believed that Rassilon was dead, but the Time Lords had figured out a way of \"resurrecting dead people in extreme circumstances\", doing \"something horrible and timey wimey\". Spin-off writer and DWM columnist Jacqueline Rayner described his condition as \"a permanent sleep which is pretty much indistinguishable from death\", and that \"He's immortal, but he has no awareness,\" and when the trap inside the Tomb of Rassilon is triggered, \"he becomes semi-aware so he can oversee or judge what's going on, before going back into his eternal sleep again\". DWM deputy editor Peter Ware believed that Rassilon is dead by the time of The Five Doctors, and his dead mind is speaking from the Matrix to the Doctors and Borusa. He mentions the line from the episode \"Hell Bent\" (2015)\u2014\"Rassilon the resurrected\", as further proof that he had died. Doctor Who scriptwriter Mark Gatiss quipped that Rassilon is \"biding his time until he regenerates into [actor] Daniel Craig\". Head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, who also wrote \"Hell Bent\", understood that Rassilon was \"alive, but in 'eternal sleep'\", having got up from his eternal sleep to participate in the Time War, \"And got killed. And resurrected.
