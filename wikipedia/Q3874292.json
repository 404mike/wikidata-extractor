He became a free agent after Bury were expelled from the Football League, and joined Tranmere Rovers in September 2019 until the end of the 2019-2020 season.

Lennon's first three months in charge saw Bolton rise ten places from bottom of the league up to fourteenth; a spell that included an eight match unbeaten run and four consecutive clean sheets. Bolton reached the fourth round of the FA Cup and took Liverpool to a replay before conceding a last minute goal to lose 2\u20131 and go out.

On 16 November, Flitcroft was sacked after a run of 11 games without a win that coincided with a series of injuries to first-team players such as Tom Pope, Danny Mayor and Nathan Cameron.
