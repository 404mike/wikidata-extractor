Boyle was one of the lesser-known, but nevertheless important, members of the successful Chelsea side of the period, usually playing in the midfield ball-winner role. He made his Chelsea debut in a League Cup semi-final against Aston Villa and ultimately picked up a winners' medal in that competition the same year after playing in Chelsea's two-legged final victory over Leicester City.\nHe played in Chelsea's FA Cup final loss to Tottenham Hotspur two years later but missed out due to injury when they won their FA Cup final against Leeds United in 1970. He made amends the following season, playing in both matches of Chelsea's successful Cup Winners' Cup final against Real Madrid in Athens.\nBoyle spent two months on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion before leaving Chelsea in December 1973 to sign for Orient. He then joined the North American Soccer League expansion side Tampa Bay Rowdies in February 1975 just ahead of their indoor campaign. He captained Tampa Bay to a runner-up finish in the 1975 NASL Indoor tournament in March, and in August to victory in Soccer Bowl '75. Boyle retired in late 1975 and later had a brief spell coaching the Rowdies in 1977 after Eddie Firmani abruptly resigned from the post. In 1980\u201381 he appeared in five additional matches for Phoenix Inferno of the MISL.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boyle", "response": ["*John Boyle (disambiguation), multiple people", "*John Boyle (congressman) (1774\u20131835), member of the U.S. House of Representatives", "*John Boyle (Northern Ireland politician) (c. 1870\u20131950), Unionist politician from Northern Ireland", "*John Boyle (bishop) (1563\u20131620), Bishop", "*John Boyle (footballer, born 1946), Scottish footballer", "*John Boyle (footballer, born 1986), Scottish footballer", "*John Boyle O'Reilly (1844\u20131890), Irish poet and novelist", "*John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork (1707\u20131762), writer and friend of Jonathan Swift", "*John Boyle, 14th Earl of Cork (1916\u20132003), Irish peer", "*John Boyle, 2nd Earl of Glasgow (1688\u20131740), Scottish politician", "*John Boyle, 3rd Earl of Glasgow (1714\u20131775), Scottish politician"]}, {"page": "Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u20131993)", "response": ["On June 19, 1974 George Strawbridge and Beau Rogers, IV purchased an expansion franchise in North American Soccer League for the sum of $25,000 and by July 24 they named Eddie Firmani their coach.
