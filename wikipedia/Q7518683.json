After two months of no further material, they began jamming new songs at a rehearsal space in Stourbridge with their sound engineer Simon Efemey.

He would sit on the floor and encourage the band when they reached a dead-end with a track. Rough iterations of the six songs they came up with were made; Hunt worked on them further at his home. Recording for their next album took place at Mockingbird Studio in Stourbridge with Efemey as producer. The studio was owned by Ross Syner and Harvey Champion, who also owned the rehearsal space that the band were previously at. Sessions were covered by money the band accumulated while promoting their seventh studio album Oh No It's... The Wonder Stuff (2012). Some of the money was earned through the crowdfunding platform PledgeMusic, which Arthy had worked with previously, though Hunt was apprehensive to the idea initially. Recording began in October 2015 and finished in January 2016. Syner and Champion served as engineers. Efemey mixed the recordings, while Kevin Metcalfe mastered them at Soundmasters.", "* Simon Efemey \u2013 producer, mixing"]}]}}
