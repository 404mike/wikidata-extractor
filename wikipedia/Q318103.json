Born in England, he played for them at under-21 level before representing Trinidad and Tobago at senior international level.\nThe majority of his career was spent in the top division in England where he was a part of the Newcastle United team which finished second in the Premier League for two successive seasons under Kevin Keegan's first tenure. Before this, he played for Reading where he was on the losing side in the 1st Division play-offs despite finishing second overall (the only occasion on which second place was not an automatic promotion position). He later played for West Ham United on two occasions (receiving an FA Cup Runner-up medal during his second term in 2006) and also for Portsmouth (where he won the 1st Division in 2002/03).\nHislop was eligible to play for both England and Trinidad and Tobago. He initially played for the England U-21 team and was on the bench for a full International against Chile, but in the end opted to play for Trinidad and Tobago. A dispute with the national team ruled him out of contention for several years, but he returned to play and starred in the country's first ever World Cup appearance in 2006.\nHislop is now working for sports news and broadcasting service ESPN where he is most often seen as a commentator on ESPN FC.
