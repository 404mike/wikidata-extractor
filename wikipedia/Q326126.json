She lobbied the minister responsible, James Stansfeld, to strengthen the proposed Public Health Bill to require owners of existing properties to pay for connection to mains drainage. The strengthened legislation was enacted in the Public Health Acts of 1874 and 1875. At the same time, she combined with the retired sanitary reformer Edwin Chadwick to persuade Stansfeld to devolve powers to enforce the law to Local Authorities, eliminating central control by medical technocrats. Her Crimean War statistics had convinced her that non-medical approaches were more effective given the state of knowledge at the time. Historians now believe that both drainage and devolved enforcement played a crucial role in increasing average national life expectancy by 20\u00a0years between 1871 and the mid-1930s during which time medical science made no impact on the most fatal epidemic diseases."]}, {"page": "Sydney Thompson Dobell", "response": ["Dobell was born at Cranbrook, Kent. His father, John Dobell, was a wine merchant and his mother Julietta was a daughter of Samuel Thompson (1766\u20131837), a London political reformer. He was an older brother of the surgeon Horace Dobell. The family moved to Cheltenham when Dobell was twelve years old. He was educated privately, and never attended either school or university. He refers to this in some lines on Cheltenham College in imitation of Chaucer, written in his eighteenth year. After a five-year engagement he married, in 1844, Emily Fordham, a lady of good family. Acquaintance with James Stansfeld (subsequently Sir James Stansfeld) and with the Birmingham preacher-politician George Dawson fed the young enthusiast's ardour for the liberalism of the day, and later led to the foundation of the Society of the Friends of Italy."]}, {"page": "Loading gauge", "response": ["A Parliamentary committee headed by James Stansfeld then reported on 23 May 1892, \"The evidence submitted to the Committee on the question of the diameter of the underground tubes containing the railways has been distinctly in favour of a minimum diameter of \".

The club came in for criticism because of its progressive view of women's rights, but also saw supporters join its ranks such as Edward Cortenay MP. However, it was not immediately popular and by January 1879, it had to raise the subscription fees in order to make up the shortfall due to the lack of numbers. A year later, it was said to have suffered from more withdrawals than new admissions and this was blamed on the poor quality of the food being served there. However, by the end of the decade, memberships had reached 600 and the club was considering moving to larger premises."]}, {"page": "John Lawrence Hammond", "response": ["*James Stansfeld: A Victorian Champion of Sex Equality (1932) with Barbara Hammond"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir James Stansfeld"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir James Stansfeld"]}, {"page": "George Dixon (MP)", "response": ["In 1855 Dixon married Mary Stansfeld (died 1885), sister of politician James Stansfeld, and daughter of James Stansfeld, a judge in Halifax.
