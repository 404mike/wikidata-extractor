After again falling down the pecking order at Ninian Park he decided to leave the club and moved to Exeter City in February 1997. However his time at the club was blighted by a persistent hamstring injury which meant he struggled to retain fitness. He was eventually forced to retire from injury in 1999 and, despite an attempted comeback in 2000, he eventually finished his career after a spell at Merthyr Tydfil."]}, {"page": "Gareth (given name)", "response": ["* Gareth Abraham (born 1969), Welsh former footballer"]}, {"page": "Abraham (surname)", "response": ["*Gareth Abraham (born 1969), Welsh association football player"]}, {"page": "Merthyr Tydfil County Borough", "response": ["*Gareth Abraham \u2014 professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Abraham, Gareth", "response": ["#redirectGareth Abraham"]}]}}
