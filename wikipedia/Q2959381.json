Robert built The Jealous Wall after falling out with his brother George, who lived on the adjacent estate at Tudenham. His wife was only released on his death in 1774.

When his widow died in 1828, Belvedere passed to her grandson Brinsley Butler, 4th Earl of Lanesborough. He rarely visited Belvedere and it was subsequently inherited on his death by his cousin Charles Brinsley Marlay in 1847. Charles moved into the house and during his time there was responsible for the alteration of the Diocletian windows on the upper fa\u00e7ade and for the addition of the terracing. He commissioned Ninian Niven, curator of the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, to draw up plans for the Victorian walled garden. In the period following the second world war, Charles Howard-Bury, who was a soldier and mountaineer, restored the house and gardens.

He returned to Tingri and then the whole expedition moved to Kharta.

It turned out that the Kharta Chu came not from the North Col but from the Lhakpa La. Reaching this col they found that the only way from there to the North Col was to descend some 1200 feet to the upper East Rongbuk Glacier and climb back up to the North Col.
