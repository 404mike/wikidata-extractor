However, the promise proved unsustainable; with sales of third-party titles in North America dwindling by that June, support for the Dreamcast rapidly decreased as numerous cancellations were made in regards to game development and multi-region game releases, with casualties such as Capcom's decision to leave Capcom vs. SNK 2 as a Japanese exclusive and Sierra Studios' cancellation of the Dreamcast port of Half-Life prominent. North America received NHL 2K2 as the final official game for the console there on February 14, 2002, just over a year after the announcement was made. Meanwhile, Sega hired Bigben Interactive in Europe to sell the remaining stock of consoles, software, and peripherals in that region. Europe, in particular, saw a lack of priority in receiving games released in other regions with the discontinuation; some had their online functionality stripped out before their release there, while others did not receive one at all. Europe received Heavy Metal: Geomatrix, Cannon Spike, Conflict Zone, Freestyle Scooter, and Evil Twin: Cyprien's Chronicles on April 26, 2002, as the final games for the console in that region. However, buoyed by the success of the NAOMI board in Japanese arcades, games continued to trickle out for the Dreamcast in Japan despite the console's lackluster success there; its final licensed game was Karous, released only in Japan on March 8, 2007, coinciding with the end of GD-ROM production the previous month.

Rare employees differed about working conditions after the Microsoft acquisition. According to Star Fox Adventures lead engineer Phil Tossell, conditions became more stressful after an \"imperceptible\" start, and the culture of the two companies began clashing. Tossell said that Microsoft gradually imposed a corporate structure on Rare, including more performance reviews and meetings, to which some Rare members found difficulty in adapting. Some admitted that early changes, such as permitting team members to discuss projects they were not working on and allowing staff members to use the Internet or listen to music during work hours, were beneficial to team morale. Betteridge called the overall change \"positive\", saying that Microsoft's capital could help Rare develop their projects. Former Rare employee Gavin Price said that some Microsoft executives, such as Phil Spencer, were supportive of the developer. Grant Kirkhope, a former composer at Rare, strongly criticised Microsoft for ruining Rare. Former Xbox executive Peter Moore voiced his disappointment with Rare's works after the acquisition. He noted that Rare employees were attempting to \"recreate the glory years\", but their skills had become outdated and were no longer \"applicable in today's market\".

Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy\u2014and only one sequel was ever released. According to Sega of America president Peter Moore, Shenmue sold \"extremely well\", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base. The high amount Shenmue went over budget was also a factor in the game's lack of profitability. Its sequel, Shenmue II, \"was completed for a much more reasonable sum\".In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGN's Travis Fahs stated that \"the [Dreamcast] era wasn't as kind to [AM2] as earlier years\"\u2014citing (among others) F355 Challenge as an \"acclaimed\" arcade game that \"didn't do much at home\", and Genki's port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, \"which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors.\" The Virtua Fighter series would experience a \"tremendous comeback\" with the universally acclaimed Virtua Fighter 4\u2014which saw a console release exclusively on PlayStation 2.
