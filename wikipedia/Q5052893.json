Many of the poets were little-known before their publication in Scars Upon My Heart. The title of the anthology is taken from a Vera Brittain poem called \"To My Brother\" in which she states: \"Your battle wounds are scars upon my heart\". This anthology includes poems such as \"Perhaps\" by Vera Brittain."]}, {"page": "British women's literature of World War I", "response": ["Catherine Reilly has closely studied women's literature from World War I and its resulting impact on the relationship between gender, class, and society. Reilly's 1981 anthology, Scars Upon my Heart: Women\u2019s Poetry and Verse of the First World War, is the first work strictly dedicated to examining women's poetry and prose from World War I. In it, she demonstrates the existence of a strong female narrative. She argues that women's writing was overshadowed by the false belief that male writing was of greater importance.Barlow 2000, p. 27. Scholar Vincent Sherry agrees, noting that women had a strong and powerful literary voice, that until recently had been ignored."]}, {"page": "List of female librarians", "response": ["| Catherine Reilly"]}, {"page": "Hollies Convent FCJ School", "response": ["* Catherine Reilly, bibliographer and anthologist"]}]}}
