The members of this ensemble, which was singing together as early as 1900 on Ernest Walker's Balliol Sunday concert series,  were the well-known Austrian soprano Miss Marie Fillunger, Miss Evelyn Downes, mezzo-soprano, Mr Seth Hughes, tenor, and Foxton Ferguson. One Year prior, a Foxton Ferguson concert in Steinway Hall featured a different quartet composed of Miss Fillunger, Miss Florence Shaw, Mr Walter Ford and Foxton Ferguson with Ernest Walker as accompanist.  By December 1900, Florence Christie had become the mezzo-soprano of the quartet, which the public regarded as Miss Fillunger's quartet and, in 1903, a fatal chamber concert at Bechstein Hall sealed any hopes of the Wagnerian Cicely Gleeson-White  taking over the soprano role.  By 1904, Foxton Ferguson's group was billing itself regularly as the \"Folk-Song Quartet\" (it was sometimes also called \"The Foxton Ferguson Vocal Quartet\" and The \"Folk-Singers\" Quartet)  and his longtime duet partner Beatrice Spencer had assumed the soprano role solidifying a stable and permanent ensemble for the next fifteen years."]}, {"page": "1949 in British music", "response": ["*February \u2013 On hearing of the death of Ernest Walker, Albert Schweitzer writes: \"Now the dear, gentle, kind, distinguished Dr. Walker has left this life.
