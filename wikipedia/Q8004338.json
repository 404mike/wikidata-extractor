He first entered the House of Commons at the 1892 General Election. Aged only 22, he was elected as the Liberal Party MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, defeating the incumbent Liberal Unionist MP, Douglas Coghill. He was re-elected at the 1895 election, but was defeated at the  1900 general election. This was on account of his active service in the Second Boer War.He did not seek election again until the 1924 general election, when he stood as a Constitutionalist candidate in the Burslem constituency. In 1924, Constitutionalist candidates were either Unionist or Liberal candidates who were supported by both local party associations. As a group, they wished to see the return of a Coalition Government. Allen narrowly lost the two-way contest to his Labour Party opponent Andrew MacLaren.Allen did not stand in 1929, but when he stood as a Constitutionalist/National candidate at the 1931 general election he won the seat from MacLaren. After the election Allen took the Liberal National whip in the House of Commons. MacLaren regained the seat, defeating Allen at the 1935 general election. Allen did not stand again.He lived at the Allen family home, Woodhead Hall, in Cheadle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Allen", "response": ["William Allen may refer to:", "*William Allen (congressman) (1827\u20131881), United States Representative from Ohio", "*William Allen (governor) (1803\u20131879), U.S. Representative, Senator, and 31st Governor of Ohio", "*William Allen (Montana politician) (1871\u20131953), member of the Montana House of Representatives and lieutenant governor", "*William Allen (Massachusetts judge) (died 1891), Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court", "* William Allen (National Liberal politician) (1870\u20131945), British politician", "*William Allen (Armagh MP) (1866\u20131947), Northern Irish unionist politician", "*William Allen (Canadian politician) (1919\u20131985), from Toronto", "*William Allen (actor) (died 1647), English actor in the Caroline era", "*William Allen (biographer) (1784\u20131868), American evangelical Congregationalist", "*William Allen (Utah architect) (1849\u20131928), American architect in Utah", "*William Allen (Royal Navy officer) (1792\u20131864), English naval officer and explorer", "*William Allen (soldier) (1845\u20131882), American recipient of Medal of Honor", "*William Allen (VC 1879) (1843\u20131890), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*William Allen (Quaker) (1770\u20131843), English Quaker, scientist and philanthropist", "*William Allen (sailor) (born 1947), American sailor and Olympic champion", "* William Allen (cardinal) (1532\u20131594), English Roman Catholic cardinal priest", "* William Allen (Quaker) (1770\u20131843), English Quaker, scientist and philanthropist", "* William Allen (Quaker minister) (1821\u20131898), American Quaker minister, also active in Canada", "* William Allen (philanthropist) (1790\u20131856), English-Australian philanthropist", "* William Allen (Congregationalist) (1847\u20131919), English-born, Australian Congregational clergyman", "*William Allen (banker) (1736\u20131792), English banker", "*William Allen (loyalist) (1704\u20131780), founder of Allentown, Pennsylvania", "*William Allen High School, Allentown, Pennsylvania"]}, {"page": "Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Allen"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*William Allen, Liberal MP 1892\u20131900, National Liberal MP 1931\u201335."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir William Allen", "|William Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Allen "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Allen "]}, {"page": "List of National Liberal Party (UK, 1931) MPs", "response": ["| William Allen || Burslem || 1931 || 1935"]}, {"page": "Burslem (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Allen"]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": [":William Allen, 31 years (1900\u20131931)", "|Sir||William Allen||1866||1947 (Hit by motor van)||Ulster Unionist Party||North Armagh (1917\u201322), Armagh (1922\u2013death)||KBE DSO"]}, {"page": "John Manchester Allen", "response": ["Allen was born in Cheadle, Staffordshire, England, in 1901.
