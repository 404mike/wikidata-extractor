Vrij Nederland published a lengthy interview with the author (he was in the Netherlands promoting the book). VPRO's 3VOOR12 reported on the 2006 edition (named \"Londonstani,\" after Malkani's novel) of \"Crossing Border,\" an annual festival in The Hague which combines music and literature, featured Dutch and British bands (including Panjabi Hit Squad and British Asian Ms Scandalous), and Malkani reading passages from his book. A review on a Hindu website praised the novel for its many deftly handled and relevant plotlines and its linguistic qualities, and saw Malkani's portrayal of \"Londonstanis\" as relevant to \"Hollandistanis\" also. Trouw, however, called the book shallow, and Dutch writer Robert Vuijsje called it the worst book of the year."]}, {"page": "Scandalous", "response": ["*Ms Scandalous (born 1985), British female rap/pop musician"]}, {"page": "List of bhangra artists", "response": ["*Ms Scandalous"]}, {"page": "Panjabi Hit Squad", "response": ["Panjabi Hit Squad are British DJs, producers and radio broadcasters for BBC Asian Network\"Panjabi Hit Squad on BBC Asian Network\", BBC.co.uk and formerly BBC 1Xtra.\"Desi Beats on 1Xtra\", BBC 1Xtra, 23 October 2009.
