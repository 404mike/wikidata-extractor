He helps Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) sell T-shirts but sells them to Mo Harris (Laila Morse), who has been asked by Becca Swanson (Simone James) to buy them so she can sell them for a greater profit. Becca insists she did not know they were Whitney's and then flirts with Fatboy. However, he later humiliates her by designing T-shirts for her that show a mirror image of the word \"chav\". He finally passes his driving test and DJs for Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) at R&R nightclub. Fatboy, Leon, Zsa\u00a0Zsa, Whitney, Lucy and Lucy's brother Peter (Thomas Law) go to Hampshire and he attends a party with Peter while the others spend time in the woods. He is reunited with Mercy but a fight breaks out so they escape and drive back to Fatboy's uncle's home. Peter hits something with the van and the next day they fear it was Leon, as he is missing. However, Leon turns up and they realise Lucy wanted to turn everyone against him, so they play a trick on her in revenge. Fatboy is then shocked to discover that Mercy is planning to move back to Nigeria. He realises that neither Mercy nor her grandmother Grace (Ellen Thomas) want to leave London, and convinces them to stay.", "The next day, Vincent discovers Ronnie planned to have him killed and crushed in a car, but asked for the car's driver to be killed, assuming it would be Vincent. Fearing that his mother Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) has been kidnapped and could possibly killed, Vincent rushes to the scrapyard to rescue her, only to find Fatboy's phone and necklace amongst some blood in the boot of the crushed car. Distraught about Fatboy\u2019s apparent demise, Vincent tells Ronnie the car was empty, and urges Claudette to end their feud with the Mitchells as it caused Fatboy\u2019s death, much to her dismay. Weeks later, Vincent confronts Claudette, who admits she knew that he would be killed if he was driving, so sent Fatboy instead. After the confrontation, where she falls unconscious down the stairs and narrowly escapes being buried in the basement, Claudette tells Donna that Vincent tried to kill her, after which he tells Donna that Claudette killed Fatboy. Donna is distraught at Fatboy\u2019s death and Claudette\u2019s actions; and after forcing Claudette to leave, Vincent gives Donna Fatboy\u2019s necklace to remember him by. In 2017, Ronnie dies, never knowing that she was indirectly responsible for Fatboy's death.
