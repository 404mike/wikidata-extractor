He noted that uniform acceleration can be used as an approximation for any form of acceleration within special relativity.Pauli (1921), 626\u2013628 In addition, Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham (1910) showed that Maxwell's equations are invariant under a much wider group of transformation than the Lorentz group, i.e., the spherical wave transformations, being a form of conformal transformations. Under those transformations the equations preserve their form for some types of accelerated motions.Warwick (2003) A general covariant formulation of electrodynamics in Minkowski space was eventually given by Friedrich Kottler (1912), whereby his formulation is also valid for general relativity.Pauli (1921), 704 Concerning the further development of the description of accelerated motion in special relativity, the works by Langevin and others for rotating frames (Born coordinates), and by Wolfgang Rindler and others for uniform accelerated frames (Rindler coordinates) must be mentioned.Rindler (2001)"]}, {"page": "Cunningham correction factor", "response": ["Ebenezer CunninghamCunningham, E., \"On the velocity of steady fall of spherical particles through fluid medium,\" Proc.

However, the idea of an aether hidden from any observation was not supported by the mainstream scientific community, therefore the aether theory of Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 was superseded by Einstein's special relativity which was subsequently formulated in the framework of four-dimensional spacetime by Minkowski.Miller (1983), pp. 216\u2013217Warwick (2003), pp. 410\u2013419, 469\u2013475Paty (1987), pp. 145\u2013147Lodge (1925)Michelson (1927)Prokhovnik (1963)"]}, {"page": "Spherical wave transformation", "response": ["Spherical wave transformations leave the form of spherical waves as well as the laws of optics and electrodynamics invariant in all inertial frames.

Time is used as fourth dimension as in Minkowski space, so spherical wave transformations are connected to the Lorentz transformation of special relativity, and it turns out that the conformal group of spacetime includes the Lorentz group and the Poincar\u00e9 group as subgroups.
