John Robson departed the club to manage Brighton and Hove Albion, and club secretary Edmund Goodman stepped in to take over the role.  Goodman's first problem was to find a replacement for goalkeeper Bob Hewitson. Hewitson had departed for Oldham, and his early replacement was William Hall of Manchester City. Hall played in the first ten games before losing his place to Josh Johnson, signed from Plymouth Argyle. Johnson swiftly established himself as first choice and would go on to play 295 times for the first team. Dick Harker left for Hibernian and Charlie Wallace was snapped up by Aston Villa, where he would go on to win both the Football League and the FA Cup. Horace Astley, hero of last season's FA Cup exploits, moved on to Heywood United, and Bill Ledger moved on to Sunderland."]}]}}
