Richard originally formed the band with Kelly Jones and Stuart Cable, playing under the name\"Tragic Love Company\". Jones played to his largest audience on 2 July 2005 as the group appeared at the Live 8 concert, in Hyde Park, London.\nJones is often noted for his tattoos, and claims; \"I got my first tattoo done in one of the Welsh Valleys when I was 16 or 17. By law you shouldn't have them before you're 18 but this tattooist bloke figured if you were old enough to walk in his shop, you were old enough to have them done. I wanted Jonesy tattooed on my arm but he spelt it wrong and put J-O-N-S-E-Y. I went back a few weeks later and asked for a big tattoo on my body but I hadn't got enough money, so instead he tattooed Richard on the side of my neck. I quite regret that one, actually.\" The 'Jonsey' tattoo on Jones' upper-right arm, among others, has since been covered up by Maori, Japanese and Tibetan designs across his arms and upper chest. He is an avid motorcycle enthusiast and has had multiple Ducati bikes. He is a personal friend of 9 time Moto GP World Champion Valentino Rossi.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberdare", "response": ["*Stereophonics \u2013 all three original members, Kelly Jones, Richard Jones and Stuart Cable were brought up in Cwmaman, Aberdare"]}, {"page": "Just Enough Education to Perform", "response": ["* Richard Jones\u00a0\u2013 bass, harmonica"]}, {"page": "Stereophonics", "response": ["Stereophonics are a Welsh rock band formed in 1992 in the village of Cwmaman in the Cynon Valley, Wales.
