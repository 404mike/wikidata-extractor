He spent the majority of his career in the Premier League, playing in the top tier of English football for Chelsea, Everton, Charlton Athletic and Norwich City. He also had a two-year spell with Sheffield United, and was capped 5 times, scoring twice for England U21.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2002\u201303 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Graham Stuart"]}, {"page": "Neville Southall", "response": ["Everton were a declining force, and finished 12th in the league in 1991\u201392 whilst exiting both the FA Cup and League Cup at the Fourth Round. They then finished 13th in the 1992\u201393 season in the newly created Premier League, just four points above the relegation zone. Kendall resigned mid-way through the 1993\u201394 campaign and was replaced by Mike Walker \u2013 Southall later described Walker as a man who loved his suntan more than football. Walker oversaw a run of bad results and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon, winning 3\u20132 after turning round a 2\u20130 deficit. Southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked up the courage to take the ball from him and convert the penalty."]}, {"page": "Raynes Park", "response": ["* Graham Stuart, footballer"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 FA Premier League", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Graham Stuart"]}, {"page": "Masters Football", "response": ["|  Graham Stuart (Everton)"]}, {"page": "Graeme Sharp", "response": ["Sharp now works for the local press in Liverpool and radio for Radio City in the north-west of England and is one of the Everton Club Ambassadors alongside Ian Snodin and Graham Stuart.

With the prolific Andy Hunt netting 24 league goals, aided by Clive Mendonca on 9, John Robinson and Graham Stuart on 7 and Richard Rufus on 6, Charlton stormed to the First Division championship winning 27 of their 46 league games to take the title with 91 points, two points ahead of Manchester City. Then, as if quashing any doubts about their title-winning form, Charlton thumped City 4\u20130 on the opening day of the Premiership.", "Charlton didn't have a prolific scorer in 2000\u201301 and again the goals were more widespread among the team. Jonatan Johansson finished top scorer with 11 league goals, and Shaun Bartlett, Claus Jensen, Graham Stuart and Mathias Svensson all hit five each. A couple of useful unbeaten runs kept Charlton around mid-table position, although they were fifth in September after beating Newcastle. The best sequence, nine games unbeaten, came between the last game of 2000, when the league double was completed over Manchester City, 4\u20131, and a goalless draw with Middlesbrough that left the Addicks in eighth place. Eventually Charlton finished the campaign in a convincing ninth place \u2013 some highlights included a 3\u20133 draw at home to Manchester United and wins at home against Chelsea and Arsenal.", "The following season started similarly in that the team reached as high as eighth at the turn of the year, but no wins in the final eight games brought them perilously close to the drop. In the end, though, three draws from the last four games ensured safety in 14th place. Ably assisted by Keith Peacock and Mervyn Day, Alan Curbishley built a sound squad capable of holding its own in the elite league with a good balance of experience and youth, with Chris Bart-Williams, Chris Powell and Graham Stuart alongside up and coming youngsters Scott Parker and Luke Young. It looked as if the team might make a real impact and five successive wins in early 2003 elevated the side to sixth, although defeat by Arsenal started a run of eight defeats in the last 10 games for a 12th-place finish."]}, {"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Graham Stuart||||MF||1993\u20131997||161||31"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 in English football", "response": ["16 November 1996 \u2013 Leicester City's sound return to the Premier League continues as they beat midlands rivals Aston Villa 3\u20131 in the league at Villa Park.
