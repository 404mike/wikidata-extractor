He had his playing career cut short by an injury, sustained playing for Aston Villa reserves, which meant he had to have his leg amputated. After this he became assistant secretary to Aston Villa. When Crystal Palace F.C. was founded Aston Villa was asked for help in setting up the club; Villa offered Goodman to Palace and he helped to appoint the first manager and found the first Chairman. After two seasons he became manager and remained so for 18 years, becoming Crystal Palace's longest serving manager in the process. Goodman could be said to be the founding father of Crystal Palace F.C.Under Goodman's management Palace was the runner up in the Southern League in 1914, behind Swindon Town, on goal-average, and won the inaugural Third Division title in 1920\u201321. Palace was relegated in 1925 and in October that year Goodman resigned and reverted to his original position of club secretary. He retired in 1933 and subsequently ran a grocery shop in nearby Anerley, South London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crystal Palace F.C.", "response": ["The professional Crystal Palace football club was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of Aston Villa assistant secretary Edmund Goodman. The club applied for election to the Football League, but were rejected and instead found itself in the Southern League Second Division for the 1905\u201306 season. Palace were successful in their inaugural season achieving promotion to the First Division, crowned as champions. They also played in the mid-week United Counties League, finishing runners-up to Watford, and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3\u20130 away to New Brompton.King, p. 10", "The Crystal Palace Company formed both the amateur and professional clubs. The first chairman of the professional Crystal Palace club was Sydney Bourne who was found by club secretary Edmund Goodman after he had examined records of FA Cup Final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. He remained chairman until his death in 1930.King, pp.\u00a08\u201323", "|align=left|Edmund Goodman"]}, {"page": "History of Crystal Palace F.C.", "response": ["The professional Crystal Palace Football Club was formed on 10 September 1905, playing in the Aston Villa colours of claret and blue. Their choice of colours was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by Edmund Goodman, an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to Palace by the Villa chairman, William McGregor. Goodman organised the business side of the club and managed the team from 1907 to 1925. A former amateur player with Villa, Goodman's playing career had been cut short by an injury which led to the amputation of his right leg.Matthews, p.\u00a013\u201314 Goodman hired John Robson from Middlesbrough to be the team's manager. Robson had transformed his previous club from an amateur outfit to an established Football League First Division team.", "John Robson left Palace to manage neighbours Croydon Common F.C. for the 1907\u201308 season, and Edmund Goodman took over as manager and club secretary. Palace had a good season, finishing fourth. Bill Davies became the first player from the club to be capped at international level when he was called up for Wales. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup, Palace lost 0\u20139 to Burnley in a second round replay, which was then a record defeat for the club. Palace finished seventh in the league the following season and fourth the season after, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club recorded seventh and fifth-place finishes over the next couple of seasons and won the London Challenge Cup in 1913, overcoming West Ham United 1\u20130 in a replay. Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913\u201314 season, with the club putting together some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to Swindon Town on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2\u20131 in the final at Highbury, and provided their first England representative in Horace Colclough, who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March 1914.Matthews, pp.16\u201319", "After one season in the Third Division South and eighteen in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager to return to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the Football League pyramid. However their stay in the division was to last as long as the existence of the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to get out of, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Third Division South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished above eighth place ten times, and never lower than fourteenth and also finished runners-up no less than three times. At the start of the 1939\u201340 season, Palace were sitting second in the table, but the season was cancelled after just three matches with the onset of the Second World War.Matthews, pp.35\u201336, 39\u201346"]}, {"page": "Goodman (surname)", "response": ["*Edmund Goodman, British football manager"]}]}}
