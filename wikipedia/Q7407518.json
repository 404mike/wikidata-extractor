Early in the second-half Brown crowned his debut with a debut League goal putting a shot past Bolton goalkeeper, Sam Gillam. Bolton played well after Brown scored and quickly equalised. Brown formed a good partnership with Everton inside-left, Edgar Chadwick but it was Nick Ross who scored the winner with a powerful shot. Everton pressed for a third but it was Bolton who came closest to scoring. Everton hung on to the lead in a close fought match.

The feat was achieved despite local amateur Alf Pugh starting in goal for Wales after the original selection, James Trainer, failed to arrive at the match. Pugh played the first 30 minutes before Wrexham's Sam Gillam arrived and took his place, thus becoming the first substitute ever used in international football. The following year, Wales played a home fixture outside the nation for the first time when a meeting with Ireland was held in Shrewsbury in an attempt to draw a large crowd. Wales won the match 5\u20132. By the early 1890s, with the domestic game thriving in England, Wales were struggling to get players released for international fixtures, particularly for away matches against Ireland which required a three-day absence from a player's club due to ferry travel. As a result, Wales finished bottom of the British Home Championship five times during the decade, including three consecutive seasons between 1891 and 1893. Wales did record their highest placed finish to date in 1895 by coming second to England after drawing all three of their fixtures, inspired by the likes of James Trainer, Billy Lewis and a debuting Billy Meredith."]}]}}
