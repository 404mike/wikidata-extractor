Towards the end of the 2015\u201316 season, a fence was constructed between the Cemetery End and the Les Hart Stand in an attempt to stop the rise of hooliganism at the ground. This further separated home and away supporters but it reduced the stadium's capacity with the consequent loss of 660 seats. The stadium's official capacity in May 2019, when Bury last played there, was 12,500 (reduced to 11,840 due to the segregation)."]}, {"page": "List of one-club men in association football", "response": ["*Les Hart (Bury): player 1936\u20131953; Coach/Physio 1954\u20131968; Manager 1969\u20131971; Physio 1972\u20131980."]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 in English football", "response": ["* 20 August 1996 \u2013 Les Hart, 79, played 280 league games at right-back for his only club Bury between 1936 and 1953, spending most of his time at Gigg Lane as captain.
