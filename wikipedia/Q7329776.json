Between 1932 and 1939 Walker was married to D'Oyly Carte chorister Ena Martin. He married the company's principal soprano Helen Roberts in 1944.\nAfter serving in the Coldstream Guards, Walker began his career in touring in concerts and revues.  He joined D'Oyly Carte at age 27 and remained with the company for 25 years.  At first playing mostly smaller roles and understudying larger ones, by 1942 Walker had been promoted as a principal baritone of the company, playing roles like Pooh Bah in The Mikado.  His total of thirty-five Savoy Opera roles is the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's all-time record.\nAfter leaving the company, Walker and Roberts were engaged in Australia by J. C. Williamson to Australia and New Zealand throughout the 1950s and early 1960s in Gilbert and Sullivan as well as other works in their repertory.  He also stage directed.  In the early 1970s, they toured for more than four years in the original Australian production of My Fair Lady and presented Gilbert and Sullivan in two-person entertainments throughout the United States and Canada.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Samuel||Leo Sheffield||Frederick Hobbs||Joseph Griffin||Richard Walker||Hilton Layland", "|Sergeant||Rutland Barrington||Fred Billington||Leo Sheffield||Sydney Granville||Richard Walker"]}, {"page": "H.M.S.
