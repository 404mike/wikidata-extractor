He became known around the world in December 1998, when he engaged in a 68-day hunger strike in an effort to persuade the government to hold a public inquiry into animal testing, something the Labour Party had said it would do before it came to power in 1997.Labour Party 1996; The Independent, 7 December 1998: 'The Independent quotes the Labour leaflet as saying, \"We will support a Royal Commission to review the effectiveness and justification of animal experiments and to examine alternatives.\" Also see Boggan 2001; Higgins 2008. The hunger strike took place while Horne was serving an 18-year sentence for planting incendiary devices in stores that sold fur coats and leather products, the longest sentence handed down to any animal rights activist by a British court.", "On 6 January 1997, six months after being jailed on remand for the firebombings, as a Category A prisoner, Horne announced that he would refuse all food unless John Major's Conservative government pledged to withdraw its support for animal testing within five years. Because Labour was regarded as likely to win the next general election, due to be held in May 1997, Horne ended his action on 9 February after 35 days without food, when Elliot Morley, then Labour animal welfare spokesperson, wrote that \"Labour is committed to a reduction and an eventual end to vivisection.\"\"Barry Horne\" , BarryHorne.org.", "The fight is not for us, not for our personal wants and needs. It is for every animal that has ever suffered and died in the vivisection labs, and for every animal that will suffer and die in those same labs unless we end this evil business now. The souls of the tortured dead cry out for justice, the cry of the living is for freedom. We can create that justice and we can deliver that freedom. The animals have no one but us. We will not fail them.Barry Horne, cited in Best 2004, p. 91.", "The hostile media response continued after his death. Kevin Toolis wrote in The Guardian: In life he was a nobody, a failed dustman turned firebomber. But in death Barry Horne will rise up as the first true martyr of the most successful terrorist group Britain has ever known, the animal rights movement.Toolis 2001. He was buried in his home town of Northampton under an oak tree in a woodland cemetery, wearing a Northampton Town football shirt. Seven hundred people attended the pagan funeral service and accompanied the coffin through the town, carrying a banner that read: \"Labour lied, Barry died\".Vidal 2001.", "*BarryHorne.org (undated). \"Barry Horne\", accessed 13 October 2009.", "*BBC News (11 March 2003).
