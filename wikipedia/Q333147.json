It was here that the industrial revolution in the Netherlands took root. Thomas Ainsworth (1795\u20131841) was one of its founding fathers. Textile production was the focus of industrial activity in Nijverdal, as it was for the rest of the Twente region.

There he began attending the Reformed-Walloon churches. As a manager of the NHM, he had a large influence on the growing textile industry in Twente.  Influenced by Thomas Ainsworth, he became involved in establishing industries in the town of Nijverdal.  He wanted his work to reflect his beliefs such as employing small-scale industries rather than large factories as the latter caused harm to the workers.  De Clercq was a supporter of the NHM, dividing organisational orders evenly across as many producers as possible in order to accomplish the work at a low price."]}, {"page": "Thomas Ainsworth (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas Ainsworth (1795\u20131841) was an Englishman and the founding father of Nijverdal.", "Thomas Ainsworth may also refer to:", "*Sir Thomas Ainsworth, 2nd Baronet of the Ainsworth baronets (1886\u20131971)", "*Sir Thomas Ainsworth, 4th Baronet of the Ainsworth baronets (1926\u20131999)"]}, {"page": "Ainsworth, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Ainsworth"]}]}}
