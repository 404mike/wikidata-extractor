MacDonald played for St Johnstone, Rangers and Hearts. He also played in one full international match for Scotland, in 1976.

He led the team as they won promotion in 1983, then narrowly missed out on winning the Scottish league championship in 1986.

At the end of the 1982\u201383 season Hearts were promoted back to the top flight. This marked an upturn in their fortunes to rejoin the more competitive clubs in Scotland's top flight. The 1985\u201386 season was their best since 1965. The league campaign started with the loss of five of the first eight games.

He took charge of the club from 10 September."]}, {"page": "David White (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["His reign was generally unsuccessful and he became the first Rangers manager not to win any major honours whilst in charge at the club. With the expectations of Rangers fans and boardroom high, coupled with the success of  Celtic under Jock Stein, the pressure began to build on White. Although he signed Colin Stein and Alex MacDonald who went on to success with the club, a defeat in the European Cup Winners' Cup to Polish team G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in late 1969 which followed a poor start to the 1969-70 season saw White become the first manager to be sacked in the club's history."]}, {"page": "Davie Cooper", "response": ["Despite losing the first two league games of the 1977\u201378 season, the new attacking trio soon found form. Following a 4\u20130 victory away to Partick Thistle, Cooper was involved in his first Old Firm match on 10 September 1977, a 3\u20132 home victory against Celtic. Describing the intensity of the match, Cooper said: \"even though we were tired by the end, we had to keep going for the fans.\" Cooper scored his first league goal for Rangers in the following match, a 3\u20133 draw against St Mirren on 17 September 1977 at Love Street. His first Ibrox goal came against his former club Clydebank on 1 October 1977. Cooper scored twice in the match, including one directly from a corner kick. The club followed this with a run of ten games undefeated, ending with a 4\u20130 loss away to Aberdeen two months later on 24 December 1977. His first trophy with Rangers came on 18 March 1978 after defeating Celtic 2\u20131 in the 1978 Scottish League Cup Final at Hampden Park, with Cooper and Smith on the scoresheet. In the league, Rangers narrowly secured the title by two points over Aberdeen, following a 2\u20130 home victory against Motherwell on 29 April 1978 with goals from Smith and Jackson. They would again face a challenge from Aberdeen in the 1978 Scottish Cup Final on 6 May 1978. Goals from Alex MacDonald and Derek Johnstone secured a 2\u20131 victory at Hampden, and a domestic treble for Rangers.  Cooper appeared in fifty-two of the fifty-three matches Rangers played in his first year at the club and scored eight goals. ", "To the surprise of many, manager Jock Wallace abruptly left Rangers on 23 May 1978 and was replaced by John Greig. The club made a poor start to the 1978-79 season, failing to win their first six league encounters. Despite this however, they recorded victories against Juventus and PSV Eindhoven in the European Cup, with Cooper failing to be selected for the ties by Greig. A mixed season domestically followed and they had all but lost the title in a 4\u20132 away defeat to Celtic on 21 May 1979. Describing losing the championship, Cooper said \"you just want to emigrate as soon as you have got changed and walked out of the ground. It is like a spectre which haunts you for weeks.\" Despite this, Rangers won the 1979 Scottish League Cup Final in a 2\u20131 victory against Aberdeen and were victorious in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final, winning 3\u20132 over Hibernian. Tensions were beginning to rise between Cooper and Greig, mainly due to less-frequent selection of Cooper by the new manager. Cooper would often return home to Hamilton complaining the club he loved was \"kicking him in the teeth\". That season, Cooper made 49 appearances and scored ten goals. On 4 August 1979, Cooper scored a memorable solo goal against Celtic in the 1979 Drybrough Cup Final at Hampden. A crossed ball in from Alex MacDonald met Cooper at the edge of the box, where he went on to \"keepie up\" the ball over Roddie MacDonald, Murdo MacLeod, Tom McAdam and Alan Sneddon before slotting the ball past onrushing Celtic goalkeeper Peter Latchford. The goal was voted the greatest ever Rangers goal by Rangers fans and listed by The Guardian's Rob Smyth as the second greatest ever solo goal, after Diego Maradona's Goal of the Century. Sandy Jardine, who had scored a spectacular second goal for Rangers during the match, admitted his goal had been overshadowed by Cooper's. \"I scored one of my best goals that day,\" said Jardine, \"and it hardly got a mention.\""]}, {"page": "1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["Rangers began their route to the final by beating Stade Rennes 2\u20131 on aggregate.  The first leg was drawn 1\u20131 with Willie Johnston scoring for Rangers.  Rangers won the return leg 1\u20130 through Alex MacDonald.  The second round saw Rangers play Sporting CP from Portugal.  Rangers led the first half of the first leg 3\u20130, but lost two goals in the second half to lead 3\u20132 going into the second leg.  The second leg finished 3\u20132 to Sporting, 5\u20135 on aggregate.  Willie Henderson scored for Rangers in extra time but Rangers then lost a goal with six minutes left to make it 6\u20136 on aggregate.  What followed has been described as being one of the most bizarre incidents in the history of any European tournament. The Dutch referee Laurens van Raavens failed to recognise that Rangers, having scored three away goals to Sporting's two, had won the tie.  But the referee made both teams take five penalties each, with Rangers losing the shootout.  After Rangers manager Willie Waddell pointed out the away goals rule to UEFA, the referee was overruled, the result overturned and Rangers were heading into the next round.  Rangers then played Torino, Italian league leaders at the time, and won 2\u20131 on aggregate.  In the semi final Rangers played Bayern Munich, who had beaten Rangers in the final five years previously in Nuremberg. Rangers progressed 3\u20131 on aggregate to reach their third European final.", "|MF ||10|| Alex MacDonald"]}]}}
