Further investigation uncovered that it had a stone cist with three roof slabs (flat rocks used to cover a grave) encompassed by smaller rocks. The cist was facing north-to-south and was fitted into the bedrock. Within the cist lied a skeleton facing towards the north. As no grave products were found alongside the skeleton, the Danes were unable to date it. However, they were able to date pit fired earthenware and sherds of an alabaster bowl found in the cairns. They postulated that the cairns and pottery most likely dated to the Bronze Age (c. 3,000 BC), which they concluded by comparison of similar Bronze Aged cairns found in Bahrain."]}]}}
