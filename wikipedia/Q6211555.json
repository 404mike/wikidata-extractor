Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Robie Macauley, Kurt Vonnegut and many other prominent novelists and poets served as faculty under Engle. He increased enrollment and oversaw numerous students of future fame and influence, including Flannery O'Connor, Philip Levine, Mark Costello, Marvin Bell, Joe Nicholson, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Donald Justice, Raymond Carver, Douglas Kent Hall, Andre Dubus, and Robert Bly. During his tenure, Engle raised millions of dollars in support of the program whose shape and direction proved the model for hundreds of writing programs that have followed. One of the Workshop's enduring legacies was that it helped mainstream humanist ideals of literature and writing: that authors creating expressly political, or works with politics or messages as their text, was a betrayal of artistic integrity and that proper writing must put any such message or theme into the subtext. The most famous principles advocated were writing from self-knowledge (write what you know) and with self-discipline (show, don\u2019t tell).https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-iowa-flattened-literature/"]}, {"page": "Len Davies", "response": ["He was again Cardiff's highest goalscorer the following year, netting 20 times despite suffering several injury problems that restricted him to 30 league appearances. However, his injury issues cost him a place in the squad for 1925 FA Cup final with Joe Nicholson starting in his place. His side went on to suffer defeat against Sheffield United. The signing of Hughie Ferguson in 1925 led to Davies being moved to an inside forward role and his scoring record fell as a result. He scored eight times during the 1925\u201326 season and seven the following year. In 1927, he was part of the Cardiff side that beat Arsenal to win the FA Cup Final, becoming the only side from outside England to have won the competition. The only goal of the game came as the opposition goalkeeper was unable to control a shot from Hughie Ferguson as Davies advanced on him. Two weeks after the final, Davies scored the opening goal in Cardiff's 2\u20130 win over Rhyl in the Welsh Cup final."]}, {"page": "1925 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Cardiff travelled to Meadow Lane for their third round tie against Notts County which they won 2\u20130 with goals from Joe Nicholson, who replaced the injured Len Davies in the starting lineup, and Jimmy Gill. Gill's goal drew considerable praise, Cardiff's match reporter writing: \"The goal by Gill was the finest exhibition of artistry ever seen... he eluded opponent after opponent, all after him like terriers and, when he placed the ball in the net, he gave Albert Iremonger no chance.\"", "In its pre-match coverage, The Times reported that Cardiff's strength would lie in the team's defensive capabilities and noted that the team relied on the \"soundness of the defence\". Fred Keenor in particular was described as having \"dominated every tie\" leading up to the final, while fellow defenders Billy Hardy, Jimmy Blair and Jimmy Nelson and goalkeeper Tom Farquharson were also picked out as key to the team's success. Cardiff's forwards were deemed to be the weaker of the two sides. Largely due to his physical prowess, Joe Nicholson, a half back who had converted to playing as a forward during the campaign, was expected to start ahead of top scorer Len Davies who had recovered from injury. Nicholson had been in doubt ahead of the tie after injuring himself in the aftermath of Cardiff's semi-final victory over Blackburn. While attempting to escape from a throng of excited fans outside the ground, he had climbed onto the canvas roof of a taxi only to fall through and suffer a cut to his knee.

He left Villa in June 1926 in a swap deal which saw Joe Nicholson join Villa and Blackburn join Cardiff City. He made his debut for Cardiff in a 4\u20133 defeat to Burnley and went on to establish himself in the side, although he was not included in the squad when the side won the FA Cup in 1927. His only goal for the club came in February 1930 when he scored against Blackpool during a 4\u20132 win. He left the club in 1931, along with Harry Wake, to join Mansfield Town.

The high-profile departures included Jack Evans, the club's first professional signing in 1910 who had been with the side for 16 years. Also leaving were Cassidy, less than a year after his \u00a33,800 move and for a fee described in The Times as \"substantially less\" than the one paid for him, and Joe Nicholson, who had led the club's attack in the 1925 FA Cup Final. Several fringe players also left the club, including Herbie Evans, Alfie Hagan, Joe Hills, Denis Lawson, Jack Page and Ebor Reed. However, the most significant departure was club captain Jimmy Blair who joined A.F.C. Bournemouth for \u00a33,900. His sale resulted in Fred Keenor being appointed the new captain of the first team. He had served as vice-captain under Blair and had filled the role on numerous occasions and was a popular choice for the position. Upon his appointment, the Football Echo remarked that Keenor was \"a leader in every sense of the word, he commands respect of colleagues and sets an inspiring example by his wholehearted enthusiasm.\""]}, {"page": "Joseph Nicholson", "response": ["*Joe Nicholson (1898\u20131974), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Joseph Robinson Nicholson", "response": ["#redirect Joe Nicholson"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Although the side ultimately missed out on the league title, their second-placed finish saw ticket sales increase greatly ahead of the new season with both the Grange and Canton stands being sold out and the rest of the ground largely full. Manager Fred Stewart, who was entering his tenth competitive season in charge, made several changes to his playing squad with ten players being signed. Harry Beadles had arrived at the club from Liverpool immediately following the end of the previous season and had been part of the club's overseas tour. He had previously had a trial at the club after the First World War which had proved unsuccessful. Several players from local teams were also brought in, including forwards Jack Nicholls, son of Cardiff director Sydney Nicholls who was signed from Newport County, and Willie Davies, signed from Swansea Town for \u00a32,500. The club also signed Joe Nicholson from Clapton Orient and Tom Sloan from Linfield, as well as James McLean from amateur side Barn Athletic, a player who was regarded as deaf and dumb although he never played for the first team.", "Cardiff began January with a 1\u20130 defeat away to Sunderland on New Year's Day and a goalless draw with Leeds two days later. Len Davies' goal provided brief respite for the side in a 1\u20130 victory over Birmingham before Cardiff failed to score in their following two matches, defeats to league leaders West Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers. The team ended their goal drought with an emphatic 4\u20130 victory over Burnley in the rearranged fixture originally scheduled for 28 December. A brace from Len Davies, a penalty by Jimmy Nelson and one from Gill secured victory in front of a relatively small home crowd of 8,000. International call-ups weakened the squad for the visit of Notts County with five first team players being chosen to play in a Scotland vs Wales fixture. Nevertheless, Cardiff held their higher ranked opponents to a 1\u20131 draw with wing-half Joe Nicholson, who was deputising as a striker in the absence of Len Davies, scoring his side's goal. A 2\u20131 victory over Everton on 25 February was followed three days later by a 3\u20130 victory over Newcastle United in which Nicholson, still filling in as a forward, scored a brace.", "In the second round, Cardiff were drawn against Fulham. The match was played in difficult conditions with The Times stating that the heavy rainfall meant that \"good football was out of the question\". The rapidly deteriorating pitch led the referee to halt the game for ten minutes before both sides agreed to continue play with Len Davies scoring the only goal of the match. Fellow First Division side Notts County were Cardiff's opponents in the third round, with County considered favourites for the tie. With Len Davies injured, his replacement Joe Nicholson opened the scoring before Jimmy Gill scored a second. Gill's goal received particular praise and was described as \"the finest exhibition of artistry ever seen. With the ball at his feet, he evaded opponent after opponent, all after him like terriers and when he placed the ball in the net he gave Iremonger no chance.\""]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["A 1\u20130 defeat in the reverse fixture against West Ham was followed by the club's first point away from home as they drew 1\u20131 with Huddersfield Town. Cardiff took the lead through Willie Davies before Clem Stephenson equalised. Nelson had the opportunity to win the match for Cardiff but failed to convert a penalty in the second half. In their next match, Cardiff defeated in-form Tottenham Hotspur, inflicting their opponents' first defeat of the season with goals from Davies and Denis Lawson. However, the team soon entered a poor run of form, losing the return fixture against Tottenham 1\u20130 before being defeated by the same scoreline against league leaders Sunderland. This was followed by a heavy 6\u20133 defeat against Blackburn Rovers. The club enjoyed a brief respite by defeating Bury 3\u20132 with goals from Joe Nicholson, Len Davies and Beadles, although The Times noted it was \"strange to find a team so good as Cardiff City so near the bottom of the table.\" Three straight defeats followed. The run began with a defeat against Birmingham in which Stewart experimented with team selection, including defender Fred Keenor at centre-forward. Cardiff took a 2\u20130 lead with goals from Willie Davies and Keenor but Birmingham recovered to take the victory, winning 3\u20132. A 5\u20130 defeat against Arsenal and a 2\u20130 loss against Manchester United left Cardiff bottom of the table at the end of October."]}]}}
