He finished first among all quarterbacks in the vertical jump, broad jump, and had a 40-yard dash time of 4.54. His time was also faster than some running backs including Tennessee's Alvin Kamara. His passing drills were described as mediocre and mildly inconsistent. To prepare for the combine, Knight worked out with Dallas Cowboys' quarterback Dak Prescott throughout the offseason, who was able to shed the idea of a limited dual-threat quarterback. After showcasing his physical ability at the combine, multiple teams approached him about the possibilities of converting to wide receiver or safety. He immediately dispelled those notions and claimed he wanted to stick to quarterback. On March 30, 2017, Knight participated at Texas A&M's pro day, along with Jermaine Eluemunor, Justin Evans, Myles Garrett, Daeshon Hall, Ricky Seals-Jones, Josh Reynolds, and seven others. Over 50 team representatives and scouts from the NFL attended as Knight was impressive throughout his passing drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, he was projected to be a seventh round pick or a priority undrafted free agent. He was ranked the 15th best quarterback prospect by NFLDraftScout.com."]}, {"page": "List of Texas A&M Aggies in the NFL draft", "response": ["| 5 || 15 || 159 || Jermaine Eluemunor || Baltimore Ravens || G"]}]}}
