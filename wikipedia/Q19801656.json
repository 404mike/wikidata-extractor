Bennett first served as Assistant Surgeon on the hospital ship Grampus, which was moored on the Thames. Then in 1833, he joined the London whaleship Tuscan. From 1833-1836 he sailed round the globe on board the 'Tuscan'. The task of this journey was to study whales, lands and nature. He described several species, for example Whalesucker (Remora australis), blue noddy and Cheilopogon nigricans. He was also a member of the Royal Geographical Society. After his return he practiced medicine in Southwark where he died in 1859 at the age of fifty-three.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Caroline Island", "response": ["The English whaling ship Tuscan reached Caroline island in 1835, and the geography and wildlife of the island were recorded by the ship's surgeon, the biologist Frederick Debell Bennett, in his Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round the Globe From the Year 18331836. Bennett knew that the island was seldom visited, \"although it is usually 'sighted' by South-Seamen, when on their way from the Society Islands to the North Pacific\". He noted that about seven years before the arrival of the Tuscan, a Captain Stavers had landed on the island and left behind some pigs, of which no trace remained."]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* F.

The Carangidae are perciform fishes in the suborder Percoidei. The species was first scientifically described in 1825 by French zoologists Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard based on the type specimen collected from the Indian Ocean, somewhere in the Malay Archipelago. They named the species Seriola bipinnulata, believing the species was related to the amberjacks. This was later revised to the genus Seriolichthys by Bleeker before the species was found to warrant a new genus. The genus Micropteryx was initially created, but was already in use in the Lepidoptera. In 1840, Frederick Debell Bennett created the genus Elagatis, taken from a name published in a whaling voyage memoir, which he used in combination with the specific name bipinnulatus, which was deemed to be incorrect, as the genus name is feminine and the original spelling of bipinnulata was reinstated. Phylogenetically, the species is most closely related to the amberjack genus, Seriola, being the most basal member identified of the carangid tribe Naucratini. This has been determined by the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b genome, as well as older morphological studies."]}]}}
