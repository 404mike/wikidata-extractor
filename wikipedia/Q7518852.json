Though a writer by profession, Goddard originally went to art school in Carlisle, then Hull, and briefly considered a career in visual media. In 1995 he directed his one and only pop promo for Edwyn Collins (the subject of one of his future books, Simply Thrilled). He started freelance writing the following year and eventually found regular work as a music journalist in London. \nHis first two books, Songs That Saved Your Life and Mozipedia, established his initial reputation in the \u201800s as an authority on The Smiths and their former lead singer Morrissey. The latter was voted Book Of The Year by readers of Mojo magazine and has since been published in America by Plume, and in Brazil by Leya. Since 2010 Goddard's writing style and choice of subjects has greatly diversified, including the first biography of Postcard Records (Simply Thrilled, 2014), a picaresque homage to The Rolling Stones (Rollaresque, 2015), and 2018\u2019s novelistic The Comeback telling the story of Elvis Presley and his 1968 Comeback Special. The latter made both Q and Mojo magazines' Music Books Of The Year lists.In 2020 he began his Bowie Odyssey series with Omnibus Press, chronicling the life of David Bowie against the cultural and social history of the 1970s, year-by-year. The first, Bowie Odyssey 70, was a Sunday Times Music Book Of The Year. The sequel, Bowie Odyssey 71, is to be published in 2021. Alongside his earlier Ziggyology \u2013 A Brief History of Ziggy Stardust it marks Goddard\u2019s third book on Bowie.\nAs a freelance journalist, his work has appeared in Uncut, Mojo, Record Collector and newspapers including The Guardian and The Mail On Sunday.  \nIn 2006 he joined Q magazine where he remained a Contributing Editor until it ceased publication in July 2020. Goddard has also supplied the accompanying essays to two deluxe collections by award-winning rock photographer Tom Sheehan and written sleevenotes for reissues by Orange Juice, Siouxsie & The Banshees, Nico and Soft Cell. In 2020 he supplied the foreword to the James live album box set Live In Extraordinary Times.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Siouxsie and the Banshees", "response": ["They were also one of the first alternative bands; music historian Peter Buckley pointed out that they were at \"the very front of the alternative-rock scene\". In 1988, \"Peek-a-Boo\" was the very first track to top the US Modern Rock chart after Billboard launched this chart in the first week of September to list the most played songs on alternative and college radio stations. Simon Goddard wrote that the \"Banshees - Mk II would become one of the biggest alternative pop groups of the 1980s\". Spin described them as \"alternative rockers\" in 1991 when referring to their presence in the top 40 chart.

The album is considered a proto-goth record. Andr\u00e9 Escarameia felt the album \"anticipated gothic rock by more than a decade due to [its] ethereally darker [ambience] and disturbing sonority.\" Its soundscape has been described as \"bleak\", \"chilly\", \"harrowing\", and \"everything from the sound of someone rapping on a coffin lid to that of being buried alive\". In her 1969 Rolling Stone review, Anne Marie Micklo described it as \"mood music, with an obscure and elusive text recited over it\". Regarding the record's sonority, British author Simon Goddard wrote, \"it was on [The Marble Index] that the real sound of Nico was unleashed: a bleak pumping misery which would define her music for the last two decades of her life.\" Lenny Kaye of Wondering Sound described the album as \"Circe-like\".", "The album has had \"a slow progress to critical darlinghood\"; for the most part, audiences have remained nonplussed. According to Simon Goddard, most critics regard it as \"[Nico's] defining avant-garde masterpiece\". The Rolling Stone Album Guide considers The Marble Index the point in Nico's discography where \"the difficult listening starts\", and the album is \"pretty amazing for it\". Anthony Carew of About.com called it \"a suite of rootless songs written with little precedent\" and \"an astonishing haunting, the work of a woman who, even whilst alive, seemed a lot like a ghost\". Anthony Thornton of NME called it an \"artistic triumph\": \"Bleak but beautiful, this album remains the most fitting embodiment of her doomed glamour.\" According to Spin, \"Few records, before or since, have sounded lonelier, spookier, or more desolate\".

In the second part of the song, he reveals that the source of this chaos is pop music, which \"says nothing to me about my life\". In reaction, he implores listeners to \"burn down the disco\" and \"hang the DJ\", the latter lyrics repeated with the addition of a chorus of schoolchildren. Journalist Nick Kent described \"Panic\" as a mandate for \"rock terrorism\". John Luerssen calls it a \"commentary on the tepid state of pop music in 1986\" and a \"chiming guitar song,\" based around a rotation between the G major and E minor chords.

The two songs share the same key as well as similar chords. Simon Goddard noted both the guitar break in \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" and the flute section in \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" (originally written as a guitar part) are based on C# minor arpeggio figure.Goddard, p. 161 The song features an ascending F#m\u2013A\u2013B chord sequence that guitarist Johnny Marr took from the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye's \"Hitch Hike\". Marr said in 1993 he included the figure as an \"in-joke\" to determine if the music press would attribute the inspiration for the part to \"There She Goes Again\" by the Velvet Underground, who he contended \"stole\" the figure from \"Hitch Hike\". Marr commented, \"I knew I was smarter than that.

Once the matter was resolved, Rough Trade owner Geoff Travis felt that \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" should be the band's \"comeback\" record. Despite Travis's advocation of the song, Simon Goddard expressed doubt that the song's \"explicit glamorisation of suicide\" would have endeared it to daytime radio. Additionally, Johnny Marr was insistent that \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" be the band's next single.Goddard, p. 159 Marr stated:", "Music critics consider \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" to be one of the Smiths' finest efforts. Simon Goddard wrote, \"In a straw poll among Smiths fans today, 'There Is a Light That Never Goes Out' would more than likely still come out victorious\", which he credits to the \"perfect balance\" of Marr's compositional skills and Morrissey's lyricism.

The opening cut, \"Pure\", had a spacious, atmospheric sound. Journalist Miranda Sawyer noted that Siouxsie's \"vocals came from a distance\", that \"there was a lot of space\" and that \"the sound was big and slow\". Music journalist Ian Birch wrote that \"Pure\" was  an atmosphere piece; \"a snarling, predatory bass stalks its ground before it's met by teeth-grinding guitar splinters, and the distant footfall of drums. Siouxsie's voice becomes an instrument.\" Music journalist Kris Needs remarked that at the end, it seeps out into \"Jigsaw Feeling\", a \"song of disorientation and bewilderment\" with a \"huge, sometimes awe-inspiring sound\". On \"Metal Postcard\", there is a \"motorik austerity\" in the rhythm patterns. The last song, \"Switch\", was arranged in three different sections, \"for the different people who swap jobs with terrible results - scientists, general practitioner and vicar\"."]}, {"page": "Five Years (David Bowie song)", "response": ["The lyrics break the news that the Earth only has five years left before it gets destroyed by an impending apocalyptic disaster. The first two verses are from the point of view of a kid, who hears this news for the first time and goes numb as it sinks in. Like the rest of the album, Bowie uses American slang and pronunciations, including \"news guy\" and \"cop\" (instead of \"newsreader\" or \"policeman\", respectively). In Ziggyology, Simon Goddard also cites the influence of On the Road by Jack Kerouac, one of Bowie's favourite books which contains the similar line \"woulda killed him if they hadn't drug me off\". By the third verse, Bowie addresses the listener directly, which was a rarity in rock lyrics at the time. Bowie observes us blissfully unaware of our fate through \"jump cuts\" of urban decay, including in fantasies of Americana using stereotypes: \u2013 the Cadillac, the \"black\", the \"queer\" and a girl carelessly enjoying a milkshake in an ice cream parlor. According to Bowie, \"we don't even know we're being sung about.\" Because of this, Bowie proclaims that he \"feels like an actor\" and \"with a flock of misfits and minorities gathering around him,\" he declares \"I want you to walk\", indirectly introducing the character of Ziggy Stardust, a bisexual alien rock star who will save the Earth from the impending disaster, who is introduced directly in the third track \"Moonage Daydream\". Pegg writes: \"It's a classic example of the dexterity and economy of Bowie's best songwriting: with its scant few lines 'Five Years' drips with implication.\" The track ends with Bowie screaming the title as the Spiders join in, transforming the \"histrionics\" into \"jolly pub chant.\" It fades out with the same drumbeat as the beginning, which \"allows the listener to catch his or her breath\" before another beat begins the next track, \"Soul Love\"."]}, {"page": "Ask (song)", "response": ["The song's lyric includes the couplet \"Writing frightening verse / To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg\", which has been interpreted as a reference to Morrissey's youth, in which he frequently wrote letters to pen pals. Simon Goddard, the author of Mozipedia, also traces the line \"Nature is a language - can't you read?\" to Alan Bennett's 1978 teleplay Me! I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which contained the line \"Nature has a language, you see, if only we'd learn to read it.\" Goddard additionally commented on the lyric as a whole, writing: \"...a superficial plea to liberate one's inhibitions, the crux of 'Ask' appears to be its protagonist\u2019s own fizzling sexual repression, amplified in Morrissey's exaggerated use of upper case in its printed lyrics [sic] and his vivid metaphor of sexual desire as a unifying explosive.\""]}, {"page": "Shakespeare's Sister (song)", "response": ["According to Simon Goddard, the lyrics also draw on Elizabeth Smart's novella By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept and the Billy Fury song \"Don't Jump\".

Simon Goddard of Q listed MDNA as Madonna's best album since Ray of Light (1998), as did Chicago Tribune reviewer Greg Kot, who felt that the singer outdid on the Orbit-produced tracks. Caryn Ganz from Spin rated the album 7 out of 10 and said that \"if there's one producer who knows how to pluck Madonna's heartstrings, it's Orbit\".
