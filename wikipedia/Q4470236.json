He was Distinguished Research Professor of Archaeology at Cardiff University from 1997 to 2018.Whittle was born on 7 May 1949. He studied Literae Humaniores (ie classics) at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. He remained at Oxford to study for a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree, which he completed in 1976 with a thesis titled \"The earlier Neolithic of Southern England and its Continental contacts\".In 1998, Whittle was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. He is also a founding Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales (FLSW).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gower Peninsula", "response": ["The Llethryd Tooth Cave, or Tooth Hole cave, is a Bronze Age ossuary site in a limestone cave, about 1,500\u00a0yards (1.4\u00a0km) north north west of the Parc Cwm long cairn cromlech, on private land along the Parc Cwm valley, near the village of Llethryd. In 1961 the cave was rediscovered by cavers, who found human bones. An excavation was carried out by D.P.\u00a0Webley & J.\u00a0Harvey in 1962 revealing the disarticulated remains (i.e. not complete skeletons) of six adults and two children, dated to the Early Bronze Age or Beaker culture. Other finds are now held at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff: Early Bronze Age, or Beaker, collared urn pottery; flaked knives; a scraper; flint flakes; a bone spatula; a needle & bead; and animal bones \u2013 the remains of domesticated animals, cat and dog. Archaeologists Alasdair Whittle and Michael Wysocki note that this period of occupation may be \"significant\", with respect to Parc Cwm long cairn, as it is \"broadly contemporary with the secondary use of the tomb\". In their article published in The Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society (vol.64 (1998), pp.\u00a0139\u201382) Whittle and Wysocki suggest corpses may have been placed in caves near the cromlech until they decomposed, when the bones were moved to the tomb \u2013 a process known as excarnation."]}, {"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Alasdair Whittle (born 1949) European Neolithic"]}, {"page": "Newgrange", "response": ["DNA analysis found that bones deposited in the most elaborate chamber belonged to a man whose parents were first-degree relatives, possibly brother and sister. In history, such inbreeding was usually only found in royal dynasties headed by 'god-kings', such as the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, who married among themselves to keep the royal bloodline 'pure'. This, together with the prestige of the burial, could mean that a similar elite group were responsible for building Newgrange. The man was distantly related to people buried in the Carrowkeel and Carrowmore tombs.\"DNA study reveals Ireland's age of 'god-kings'\". BBC News, 17 June 2020. However, archaeologist Alasdair Whittle said that social difference in the Neolithic was often short-lived, speculating that an elite may have arisen temporarily in response to crisis. He suggested that Newgrange may have been a communal monument at certain times and co-opted as a personal tomb for brief periods.\"DNA from ancient Irish tomb reveals incest and an elite class that ruled early farmers\".

He notes that henges and the grooved ware pottery often found at them are two examples of the British Neolithic not found on the Continent. Caroline Malone (2001) also says that henges were not built in the rest of Western Europe, but they developed from a broader tradition of enclosure to become \"a phenomenon of the British Isles, a native tradition with sophisticated architecture and calendrical functions.\""]}, {"page": "Alasdair", "response": ["*Alasdair Whittle, British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "The Trundle", "response": ["The Trundle was one of the sites included in Gathering Time, a project funded by English Heritage and the Arts and Humanities Research Council to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using Bayesian analysis.

Some radiocarbon dates had been obtained from animal bone samples and published in 1988, and these were included.Drewett, Rudling & Gardiner (1988), p. 35.  Four additional samples were taken from finds from the earlier digs.  The limited number of samples meant that it was not possible to construct a chronology with high confidence, but the results suggest that the inner ditch dates to after 3900\u20133370 BC; the second ditch to after 3650\u20133520 BC; and the spiral ditch to after 3940\u20133370 BC.

John Lubbock and Hussey Vivian excavated it that year, believing it to be a round barrow. The excavation revealed human bones that were \"much broken and in no regular arrangement\", animal remains (\"deer and swine's teeth\"), and sherds of \"plain Western Neolithic pottery\". The bones, initially thought to heve been disturbed by repeated access or subsequent interments, were at first thought to be from 20 to 24\u00a0individuals, all of whom except three were adults. Archaeologists Alasdair Whittle and Michael Wysocki note that such estimates were commonly based on the \"numbers of skulls or mandibles\", and recent analysis has shown the bones to be from at least 40\u00a0individuals. Following the excavation, most of the human remains were reburied in clay pots beneath their original contexts, some are held in the Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford, England \u2013 with the animal and pottery remains \u2013 and the whereabouts of the remainder are unrecorded."]}, {"page": "Parc le Breos", "response": ["The Llethryd Tooth Cave, or Tooth Hole cave, is an Early Bronze Age ossuary site in a limestone cave, about  north, northwest of the Parc Cwm long cairn cromlech, on private land along the Parc le Breos Cwm valley, near the village of Llethryd.
