Best known for his syncopated novelty piano solos, he wrote over 300 piano pieces, many of which were named after flowers and trees, including his best-known composition, Marigold (1927). He also ran the successful School of Syncopation for whose members he published hundreds of his own arrangements of popular songs.\nHe also composed works for piano and orchestra, often in suites with evocative names such as the 'Aquarium Suite' (1937), comprising \"Willow Moss\", \"Moorish Idol\", \"Fantail\", and \"Whirligig\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
