He attended Greenfield Street Boys' Secondary Modern School in Hyde, Cheshire.\nWest began his career at Burnley, a product of the club's prolific youth system. In 1973, he was set for a move to Sunderland but was told by medical staff that he had a condition which meant he would be crippled if he continued playing. He believed there was nothing wrong, and moved to Luton Town that year.\nHe spent eight seasons at Luton Town, becoming an important player as well as club captain. West made his name as a cultured midfielder who though not prolific was a fine passer of the ball. He was ever-present in his one top-flight season with the Hatters (1974\u201375). In 1976, he moved the Minnesota Kicks of the North American Soccer League, playing with the team through the 1979 season. Moving to Millwall in 1981, West spent two seasons there before moving on to non-League football - as manager of Isthmian League strugglers Hitchin Town, being sacked in September 1988 after a poor start to the season.\nWest is now a pastor at a local church in Luton, named Luton Christian Fellowship. He is also the Club Chaplain at Luton Town Football Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hyde, Greater Manchester", "response": ["*Alan West (born 1951 in Hyde), footballer, central midfielder for Burnley and Luton Town"]}, {"page": "Minnesota Kicks", "response": ["In 1977, the Kicks won the Western Division again, and averaged 32,775 fans, second only to the New York Cosmos.Steve Holroyd, The Year in American Soccer\u00a0\u2013 1977, http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1977.html  The Kicks were again led by Alan Willey with 14 goals, while midfielder Alan West was named to the All-Star team.
