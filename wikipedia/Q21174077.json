He is the author of the best selling book What on Earth Happened: The Complete Story of the Planet (Bloomsbury, 2008), which has sold 500,000 copies. Lloyd is a keen advocate of connected learning. In collaboration with Beckenham-based illustrator Andy Forshaw, Lloyd has established a format for telling giant narratives to young people by using illustrative timelines called Wallbooks, which present a broader view of world history and visualise connections between the past and the present day.\nLloyd is regularly invited to give talks at schools, literary festivals, universities, societies, museums, businesses and institutes on a variety of topics including cross-curricular integration, narrative journeys around each of his books as well as motivational lectures. He gave a TEDx conference lecture at Reading University in early 2015.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Lloyd (disambiguation)", "response": ["Christopher Lloyd (born 1938) is an American actor.", "Christopher Lloyd may also refer to:", "*Christopher Lloyd (art historian) (born 1945), Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, 1988\u20132005", "*Christopher Lloyd (gardener) (1921\u20132006), author of gardening books", "*Christopher Lloyd (naval historian) (1906\u20131986), British naval historian", "*Christopher Lloyd (TV producer) (born 1960), American TV screenwriter and producer", "*Christopher Lloyd (world history author) (born 1968), historian, educationalist and author"]}, {"page": "Christopher Lloyd (gardener)", "response": ["Lloyd was a great-grandson of Edwin Wilkins Field, a law-reforming solicitor, and the great uncle of Christopher Lloyd, the author of numerous non-fiction books, including the popular What on Earth?
