The two young men took to each other immediately, and together they dreamed of a world ruled by wizards over Muggles by uniting the legendary Deathly Hallows. They believed that if they were forced to destroy a few along the way, it would still be \"for the greater good\", and the sufferings and losses would be rewarded a hundredfold in the end. However, this scenario would never happen, as an argument between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald led to a duel that resulted in Ariana's death. For the rest of his life, Albus felt guilty, never certain whether it was his own curse or another's that had killed his sister. Grindelwald stormed back to Bagshot's home and departed to begin his own rule, leaving the country hours later. As a result of his mistakes, Albus felt that he was not to be trusted with power and, because of this, never took the position of Minister for Magic, despite being offered it several times. Dumbledore returned to Hogwarts as professor of Transfiguration, and he served in recruiting students for the school."]}, {"page": "List of Harry Potter characters", "response": ["*Bathilda Bagshot \u2013 Author of A History of Magic, and the great aunt of Gellert Grindelwald."]}, {"page": "Places in Harry Potter", "response": ["Godric's Hollow was the home of long-dead Hogwarts founder Godric Gryffindor (after whom the village was named) and the home of James Potter's family.

Nagini is later placed inside the corpse of Bathilda Bagshot by Voldemort, to enable a surprise assault on Harry when he visits Godric's Hollow. Because some snakes (pit vipers and pythons) can sense heat and movement in a way humans cannot, Nagini is able to detect Harry and Hermione even when they are under the Invisibility Cloak. After discovering that Harry is searching for his Horcruxes, Voldemort places Nagini into a protective magical cage to prevent her from being killed, but uses her to kill Severus Snape by expanding the cage over him. When Harry is apparently killed by Voldemort, Nagini is released from the protective enchantment and is draped around Voldemort's shoulders during the Death Eaters' victory march back to Hogwarts. This allows Neville Longbottom to behead Nagini, using Godric Gryffindor's sword. In the film, Nagini is instead protected by a force field and participates in the final battle as opposed to dying before it began; her fate is ultimately the same as in the book."]}, {"page": "Bagshot (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bathilda Bagshot, a fictional character in the Harry Potter books"]}, {"page": "Bathilde", "response": ["*Bathilda Bagshot, fictional character from the Harry Potter universe"]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1", "response": ["Harry and Hermione search for the sword in Godric's Hollow and encounter the Deathly Hallows symbol in a cemetery.
