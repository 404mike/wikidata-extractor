His field of research is ancient Greek history, language and literature, and culture, art and archaeology of the Byzantine world. Since retiring in 2002 he has continued his researches into Greek palaeography, textual criticism and the history of classical scholarship. In the series of Oxford Classical Texts his edition of Aristophanes appeared in 2007, and a new edition of Herodotus for the same series appeared in 2015.  Another substantial piece of work was a contribution to the study of the famous Archimedes Palimpsest, which was sold at auction in New York in 1998 for $2,000,000; the results of a collaboration lasting ten years and involving experts in various fields appeared in The Archimedes palimpsest (Cambridge University Press 2011), which was described by the reviewer in the TLS as \"the most beautiful book produced in this century\".", "link_mentions": []}}
