He is best known for temporarily replacing Ringo Starr in the Beatles for a series of concerts during the height of 'Beatlemania' in 1964, elevating him from relative obscurity to worldwide fame and then back again in the space of a fortnight. Nicol had hoped that his association with the Beatles would greatly enhance his career but instead found that the spotlight moved away from him once Starr returned to the group, and in 1965 his subsequent lack of commercial success culminated in bankruptcy. In 1967, after having worked with a number of different bands which included a successful relationship with the Spotnicks, he left the music business to pursue a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. Over the decades, Nicol increasingly shied away from media attention, preferring not to discuss his connection to the Beatles nor seeking financial gain from it. He has a son, Howard, who is a BAFTA award-winning sound engineer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 3", "response": ["*1939 \u2013 Jimmie Nicol, English drummer "]}, {"page": "Ringo Starr", "response": ["During an interview with Playboy in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: \"[Best] took little pills to make him ill\". Soon after, Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best's favour. In June, the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Before the start of the tour, Starr was stricken with a high-grade fever, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, and briefly stayed in a local hospital, followed by several days of recuperation at home. He was temporarily replaced for five concerts by 24-year-old session drummer Jimmie Nicol. Starr was discharged from the hospital and rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June. He later said that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness. In August, the Beatles were introduced to American songwriter Bob Dylan, who offered the group cannabis cigarettes. Starr was the first to try one but the others were hesitant.: Meeting Dylan in August;  Starr was the first Beatle to smoke cannabis."]}, {"page": "The Beatles", "response": ["* Jimmie Nicol\u00a0\u2013 drums (1964)"]}, {"page": "Fifth Beatle", "response": ["===Jimmie Nicol===", "Jimmie Nicol played drums for the first eight shows of The Beatles' 1964 world tour.

The title and music suggest optimism, but some of the song's lyrics have a more negative tone. In this sense, it reflects the contrasting personas of the two songwriters. In response to McCartney's line, \"It's getting better all the time\", Lennon replies, \"Can't get no worse!\" In a December 1983 interview, McCartney praised this contribution as an example of things he \"couldn't ever have done [him]self\". In a 1969 interview, Lennon cited \"Getting Better\" as an example of \"pure Beatles\" music, whereby, with the four band members developing a song, \"we've all written it and we've all turned it into sort of pure Beatle.\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required)."]}, {"page": "Beatallica", "response": ["| Joey Jordison, Jimmie Nicol"]}, {"page": "Nicol", "response": ["* Jimmie Nicol, British drummer"]}, {"page": "You Know What to Do", "response": ["During a photographic assignment on the morning of 3 June 1964, Ringo Starr was taken ill with tonsillitis and pharyngitis, 24 hours before the Beatles were due to leave for a six-country tour.
