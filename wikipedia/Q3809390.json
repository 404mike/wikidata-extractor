He accepted on 23 January 1792, and began his duties at York on 5 February.  In 1801 he became sole minister on Cappe's death. The chief feature of his exegetical work was his treatment of prophecy, limiting the range of its prediction, confining that of Hebrew prophecy to the age of its production, and bounding our Lord's predictions by the destruction of Jerusalem. He broke with the Priestley school, rejecting a general resurrection and fixing the last judgment at death. In these and other points he closely followed the system of Newcome Cappe, but his careful avoidance of dogmatism left his pupils free, and none of them followed him into \u2018Cappism.\u2019 Among his coadjutors were Theophilus Browne, William Turnersee William Turner (1714\u20131794) and William Hincks.[see under , Robert Dix Hincks] From 1810 he had the invaluable co-operation of John Kenrick, who married his elder daughter L\u00e6titia."]}, {"page": "James Yates (minister)", "response": ["Receiving early training from William Shepherd, he entered Glasgow University in 1805, and went on for his divinity course (1808) to Manchester College, then at York, under Charles Wellbeloved.

After his father, probably the greatest influence on the young Tayler was Kenrick. His father, at first sceptical of Manchester College, took a very keen interest and closely watched his education at York, personally negotiating with Kenrick about the structure of some of his sons lessons. By March 1816, he was already aware of the plans his father had made for him to study at the University of Glasgow, \"It is now determined that my father\u2014intends me to spend my next session at Glasgow, before I enter in my third year here.\"J.

University of Stirling, 2006) By February 1823 there is confirmation of his competence in German in a letter to his uncle Richard Tayler: \"I have so far mastered German, as to be able to read the language with pleasure, and can use my knowledge of it profitably in referring to difficult books, connected with my other studies\". In 1830 he published two articles on the German philosopher and theologian Johann Gottfried Herder(1744\u20131803) in the Monthly Repository Some Account of the Life and Writings of Herder, two years later he published four articles entitled Herder's Thoughts on the Philosophy of the History of Mankind. In these articles, Tayler had translated passages from almost all of the twenty books of Herder's major work the Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit, blissfully unaware of Thomas Otton Churchill's earlier translation from 1800. His study and knowledge of Herder's works, following Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772\u20131834), William Taylor of Norwich (1765\u20131836), Thomas De Quincey (1785\u20131859) and his close personal friend Henry Crabb Robinson (1775\u20131867), was probably the most wide-ranging in England of the nineteenth century.
