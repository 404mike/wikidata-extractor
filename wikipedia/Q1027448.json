He scored 106 league goals in 294 appearances and continuously played in the first seven Premier League seasons, which included three years with Southampton before retiring through injury at the age of 32. He was capped three times by England, scoring 1 goal and also made appearances at England U21 and England B level.\nSince retiring, Hirst has worked at Sheffield Wednesday and Crystal Palace as an academy coach, he has also worked back with Wednesday as a host in their corporate hospitality suites.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Ferguson", "response": ["During the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton, but lost out to Blackburn Rovers. He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst, but manager Trevor Francis rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid \u00a31\u00a0million for 23-year-old Cambridge United striker Dion Dublin \u2013 his only major signing of the summer."]}, {"page": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C.", "response": ["1992\u201393 was one of the most eventful seasons in the history of Sheffield Wednesday football club. They finished seventh in the Premier League and reached the finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup, but were on the losing side to Arsenal in both games, the FA Cup final going to a replay and only settled in the last minute of extra time. This prevented the Owls from making another appearance in European competition. Still, the 1992\u201393 season established Sheffield Wednesday as a top club. Midfielder Chris Waddle was voted Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, and the strike partnership of David Hirst and Mark Bright was one of the most feared in the country. Francis was unable to achieve any more success at the club, and two seasons later he was sacked. His successor was former Luton, Leicester and Tottenham manager David Pleat.", "The fastest shot ever recorded in the Premier League was hit by David Hirst against Arsenal at Highbury in September 1996 \u2013 Hirst hit the bar with a shot clocked at 114 mph."]}, {"page": "Eric Cantona", "response": ["Cantona left Leeds for Manchester United for \u00a31.2\u00a0million on 26 November 1992. Leeds chairman Bill Fotherby had telephoned Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards to enquire about the availability of Denis Irwin. Edwards was in a meeting with manager Alex Ferguson at the time, and both agreed that Irwin was not for sale. Ferguson had identified that his team was in need of a striker, having recently made unsuccessful bids for David Hirst, Matt Le Tissier and Brian Deane, and instructed his chairman to ask whether Cantona was for sale. Fotherby had to consult with Wilkinson, but within a few days the deal was complete.", "United's season had been disappointing up to Cantona's signing. They were falling behind the likes of big-spending Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers in the race for the first Premier League title, as well as surprise challengers including Norwich City and Queens Park Rangers. Goalscoring had been a problem since the halfway point of the previous season \u2013 when it had cost them the league title as they suffered defeats or were held to draws at the hands of teams they had been expected to beat. Ferguson had first tried to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton during the 1992 close season, but lost out to Blackburn Rovers. He then spent \u00a31\u00a0million on Dion Dublin, who suffered a broken leg a few games into the season and was out of action for six months. A \u00a33\u00a0million bid for Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst was turned down, and by 7 November, United were eighth in the Premier League."]}, {"page": "Ian Wright", "response": ["Taylor, who became England manager after the 1990 World Cup in Italy and remained in charge for 38 matches, only handed Wright nine starts and seven substitute appearances. He opted instead to use a whole host of less prolific strikers, including Nigel Clough of Nottingham Forest, Paul Stewart of Tottenham Hotspur, David Hirst of Sheffield Wednesday and Brian Deane of Sheffield United. Wright did not make it into the squad for Euro 1992, with Clough, Gary Lineker of Tottenham Hotspur, Alan Shearer of Southampton and Arsenal teammates Alan Smith and Paul Merson preferred. This was particularly surprising as Wright had been the highest top division goalscorer in England that season."]}, {"page": "Allan Clarke (footballer)", "response": ["Clarke had another spell at Barnsley between 1 July 1985 and 8 November 1989. Despite having no money to spend, low gates, and being forced to sell players such as David Hirst and John Beresford, Clarke led Barnsley to the fifth round of the FA Cup twice, when they were knocked out by Arsenal in 1987 and Everton in 1989. At the end of 1988\u201389 season, Barnsley finished just two points off securing a play-off place, losing only twice in the last 17 games. However, in the following season Barnsley played poorly and with the club third from bottom in the Second Division, he was sacked. Clarke was Lincoln City manager for six months but he was sacked on 30 November 1990 to be replaced by Steve Thompson. After a few months scouting for Derby County, Clarke has not been employed in football since."]}, {"page": "Cudworth, South Yorkshire", "response": ["* David Hirst (b. 1967), footballer who played for Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday and England."]}, {"page": "Mark Hughes", "response": ["In July 1998, Hughes was signed by Southampton for a fee of \u00a3650,000 by manager Dave Jones, as an alternative to injury-plagued David Hirst, who retired within 18 months of Hughes' arrival.

The first victory of the league season came at the fourth attempt when a late goal by Dublin gave them a 1\u20130 win at Southampton, but Dublin then broke his leg in the next game against Crystal Palace and was sidelined for sixth months. Some decent results including wins over Leeds United and Nottingham Forest followed, but by late October United had endured a run of five successive draws and the all too familiar goal shortage was attributed to this once again. Defeats against Wimbledon and Ron Atkinson's Aston Villa saw United occupy 10th place in the league by 7 November 1992, with one of the lowest goal tallies in the division. Over the next couple of weeks, United were linked with moves for some of the most highly regarded strikers in the English league, including Brian Deane and David Hirst, but on 26 November 1992 United made a \u00a31.1\u00a0million move for French striker Eric Cantona, who had helped Leeds United win the previous season's league title. The arrival of Cantona helped transform United's fortunes, and by the turn of 1993 they were looking like title contenders again. Despite challenges from Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers and surprise contenders Norwich City, United went on a storming run during the final weeks of the season to win the title by a 10-point margin and end their 26-year wait. United were actually confirmed as champions without kicking a ball, when on 2 May 1993 their last remaining contenders Aston Villa surprisingly lost 1\u20130 at home to unfancied Oldham Athletic, who had given United a serious challenge in the FA Cup semi-finals three seasons earlier and would do so again the following season."]}, {"page": "Mark Bright", "response": ["Bright joined Sheffield Wednesday in September 1992 in a cash plus player exchange deal involving fellow striker Paul Williams that was rated at a total transfer value of \u00a31,375,000. The Wednesday players were experienced and at the peak of their careers; manager Trevor Francis was eager to win trophies at Hillsborough and felt Bright would prove a good partner to club stalwart David Hirst, particularly with the highly talented Chris Waddle in midfield. After scoring six goals in the League Cup, Bright played in the League Cup final, which ended in a 2\u20131 defeat to Arsenal. Wednesday also reached the final of the FA Cup, where they would again face Arsenal, with Bright scoring an extra-time header against derby rivals Sheffield United to secure victory in the semi-finals. The final proved to be a disappointment however, as he controversially elbowed Arsenal defender Andy Linighan in the face, causing a broken nose. Later, with the scores level in the last minute of extra time, a heavily bandaged Linighan out-jumped Bright from a corner to score the winning goal. After the game, Bright phoned Linighan to apologise."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*David Hirst, footballer"]}, {"page": "Egil \u00d8stenstad", "response": ["By the start of the following season, Souness had departed to be replaced by Dave Jones from Stockport County.

In a phenomenal sequence, he scored 12 goals in as many games, and after four years as a defender, was called up to the England national team as a striker. Warhurst was injured, however, and missed an opportunity to win his first cap. His scoring ratio inevitably slowed down, and when Hirst returned to action, Warhurst fell out with manager Trevor Francis, who wanted the player to return to defensive duties. In the summer of 1993, Warhurst was transfer-listed and left the club, having scored 18 goals in 88 games in Sheffield. Whilst at Wednesday, Warhurst played in both the 1993 League Cup Final as a striker, and the 1993 FA Cup Final as a centre back, due to David Hirst returning from injury and defenders Nigel Pearson and Phil King absent."]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 in English football", "response": ["24 October 1992 \u2013 Newcastle United's 11-match winning start to the Division One campaign ends with a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Grimsby Town.
