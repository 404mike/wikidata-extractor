It is the first stop-motion film to use a 3D color printer to create character faces, and only the second to be shot in 3D. In the film, Norman, a young boy who can communicate with ghosts, is given the task of ending a 300-year-old witch's curse on his Massachusetts town.", "The idea of the film came from Chris Butler, who, realizing that zombie films often contained a degree of social commentary, thought making such a movie for kids could help express the challenges kids face growing up.", "The film has drawn attention for the revelation in its final scenes that supporting character Mitch is gay, making him the first openly gay character in a mainstream animated film. Nancy French of National Review Online suggested that the film could lead parents \"to answer unwanted questions about sex and homosexuality on the way home from the movie theater.\" Conversely, Mike Ryan of The Huffington Post cited Mitch's inclusion as one of the reasons why ParaNorman is \"remarkable.\" Co-director Chris Butler said that the character was explicitly connected with the film's message: \"If we're saying to anyone that watches this movie don't judge other people, then we've got to have the strength of our convictions.\" In 2013, ParaNorman was the first-ever PG-rated movie nominated by GLAAD in its annual GLAAD Media Awards, although it ultimately lost to The Perks of Being a Wallflower.", "| Sam Fell, Chris Butler", "| Sam Fell, Chris Butler", "| Chris Butler", "| Sam Fell and Chris Butler", "| Chris Butler, Sam Fell, Travis Knight, Brad Schiff"]}]}}
