In 1617 Gibbons gained the position as keyboard player in an ensemble, organised by John Cooper, for the privy chamber of Prince Charles (later King Charles I). Gibbons was the only keyboardist in a group of 17 musicians which included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger, Thomas Ford, Robert Johnson and Thomas Lupo. The Prince himself was thought to have occasionally joined on either the Bass-Viol or Viol da Gamba. It is likely that Gibbons, along with Coperario, was able to write for this ensemble and had pieces premiered by it. In addition to this, Gibbons probably gained a 3rd position in September 1619, attending the royal privy chamber of James I. His next major work, Fantasies of Three Parts was published around 1620 and dedicated it to Edmund Wray. This seemingly random dedication has provoked much speculation. It may be because Wray could secure Gibbons a better post, or it may be an action of gratitude for having already secured him the post for the royal privy chamber of the King."]}, {"page": "1607 in music", "response": ["*Thomas Ford \u2013 Musicke of sundrie kindes, set forth in two bookes (London: John Browne)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Ford", "response": ["* Thomas Ford (martyr) (died 1582), English martyr", "* Thomas Ford (composer) (c. 1580\u20131648), English composer, lutenist, and viol player", "* Thomas Ford (minister) (1598\u20131674), English nonconformist minister", "* Thomas Ford (politician) (1800\u20131850), governor of Illinois", "* Thomas Ford (rower), British rower", "* Thomas Ford (architect) (1891\u20131971), British architect"]}, {"page": "List of Baroque composers", "response": ["* Thomas Ford (c. 1580\u20131648)"]}, {"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["*Thomas Ford (c. 1580 \u2013 1648)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Foord", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Ford (composer)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Foard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Ford (composer)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Fourd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Ford (composer)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Fourde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Ford (composer)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Forde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Ford (composer)"]}, {"page": "William Squire", "response": ["In 1967 William Squire collaborated with fellow Welshman and St. John's College, Cambridge Organist and Director of Music George Guest on the LP recording of readings and carols, A Meditation on Christ's Nativity (Argo Records [UK] ZRG 550, released in 1968).
