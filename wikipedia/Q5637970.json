It's just is a testament to how amazing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was and how much she meant to our country.\" Holmes also stated both should be watched due to covering different periods of Jackie's life.

Edna believes that designing clothes for superheroes is similar to designing for gods, and thus considers herself to be far superior to other fashion designers.

Despite designing elaborate costumes for a living, Edna prefers a more simple aesthetic for herself, generally avoiding nail polish and accessories. Racked's Carlye Wisel observed that although the sequel \"may have deep roots in midcentury-modern design ... Edna remains true to her forward-looking style, wearing a red silk kimono as well as an asymmetrical sheath that feels like yet another nod to Kawakubo\u2019s work.\" In addition to being a talented fashion designer, Edna has also demonstrated proficiency in psychology. In addition to designing their clothes, she offers advice to her clients whenever she feels that they require it, demonstrating a \"zero-tolerance policy for emotional weakness\" which, according to The Dissolve's Charles Bramesco, represents Bird's \"lament[ing] regular folks\u2019 tendency to impede awesome people from being awesome.\" Edna is known for her tendency to refer to her cohorts as \"dahling\", while her colleagues affectionately refer to her as \"E\".
