Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look\u2014and reputed invention of the safety-pin aesthetic\u2014was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario Malcolm McLaren and, in turn, British punk style.Strongman (2008), pp. 58, 63, 64; Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 78.

Q magazine included John McKay's guitar playing on \"Hong Kong Garden\"  in their list of \"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever\", while Mojo rated guitarist John McGeoch in their list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" for his work on \"Spellbound\". The Times cited the group as \"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\".", "Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin met at a Roxy Music concert in September 1975, at a time when glam rock had faded and there was nothing new coming through with which they could identify. From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the \"Bromley Contingent\", as most of them came from the Bromley area in south east London, a label Severin came to despise. \"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \"The Lord's Prayer\".", "The two songwriters of the Smiths cited the band; singer Morrissey said that \"Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent\", and that \"they were one of the great groups of the late 1970s, early 1980s\".

This is a great Banshees record[...], I like their sound. I used to see them quite a lot when I was younger.\" Commenting on the original Banshees line-up and they were different from other groups, Gahan said:  \"Siouxsie And The Banshees, whom I adored, sang much more abstract, artistic about frustration. Colder and darker\". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected \"Jigsaw Feeling\" from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited \"Hong Kong Garden\" in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, saying \"it was a completely new world\".

I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees\". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, \"They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We\u2019re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we\u2019re coming from\".

On 1 December 1976, the band and members of the Bromley Contingent created a storm of publicity by swearing during an early evening live broadcast of Thames Television's Today programme, hosted by Bill Grundy. Appearing as last-minute replacements for fellow EMI artists Queen, who had dropped out because of Freddie Mercury's dental appointment, the band and their entourage were offered drinks as they waited to go on air. During the interview, Jones said the band had \"fucking spent\" its label advance and Rotten used the word \"shit\", although both of these statements were apparently inaudible to Grundy, who had earlier claimed to be drunk. He then engaged in repartee with Siouxsie Sioux, who declared that she had \"always wanted to meet\" him. Grundy responded, \"Did you really? We'll meet afterwards, shall we?\" This prompted the following exchange between Jones and the host:", "Critic Bill Wyman acknowledges that Lydon's \"fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma\" were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations. While some of the Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not\u2014including what McLaren himself cites as the \"pivotal moment that changed everything\", the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show.See, for instance, Temple's commentary: \"[It] was not planned at all. It was totally spontaneous. And as the band will tell you, Malcolm said, 'You've blown it. You've ruined everything I've worked for'\" (Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 27:26\u201327:33); and Matlock's confirmation (Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 145, 147). Concerning the time the band spent waiting to go on air, Siouxsie Sioux later said, \"I've got a feeling that Malcolm was geeing them up, stirring it a bit\" (Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 257). Her view is belied by the version of the incident in Phil Strongman's Pretty Vacant, which appears to rely on McLaren himself (pp. 154\u2013155). According to Strongman, McLaren \"was inconsolable\" (p. 154). \"Malcolm milked situations\", says Cook, \"he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 338. It is also hard to ascribe the effect of the Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren \"was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets....
