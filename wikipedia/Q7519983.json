Art historians Simon Watney and Roger Fry debate over two places in which Abstract Impressionism may fit.

The view of the professional body for art historians in Britain, the Association of Art Historians, was expressed by Rosa Somerville writing in the Association's journal, The Art Book, in 2010 where she stated that the new dictionary \"is a great advance on the work ... that was begun so enthusiastically and extensively by Rupert Gunnis\". Somerville added that the new dictionary is \"a handsome and scholarly reference book detailing British sculptors between the Restoration and the Great Exhibition\". John Kenworthy-Browne, writing in Apollo magazine, said: \"This magnificent dictionary of British sculptors supersedes Rupert Gunnis's standard work simply by the sheer volume of information that it presents.\" Similarly in The Art Newspaper, Oliver Garnett of the National Trust wrote: \"The result is breathtaking: 1,000 additional biographies, followed by work lists covering 35,000 individual pieces, tied to a bibliography of 3,000 items which will be immensely useful in its own right.\" Similar praise came from Simon Watney, writing in The Burlington Magazine, who said of the work that went into the new dictionary: \"The result is a book of unrivalled authority, which employs a pleasurably straightforward format of biographies followed in each case by chronological sequences of religious and then secular works.\" A more qualified review came from Jean Wilson of the Church Monuments Society who, while allowing that the book \"improves tremendously on its predecessor, that its coverage is enormously increased, and that it is enlightening\", uncovered a number of \"exasperating problems\" of error and inconsistency in the book's indexes, and suggested that these do not reach the \"high standards set by the editors\" elsewhere in the volume."]}, {"page": "Gay Left", "response": ["!Simon Watney"]}, {"page": "Opendra Narayan", "response": ["Simon Watney has described Narayan's explanation of the spread of HIV/AIDS among gay males as 'uniquely disgusting' Simon Watney, Policing Desire: Pornography, Aids, and the Media, (1997) Page 111 when he quotes Narayan's statement that:"]}, {"page": "Simon watney", "response": ["#REDIRECT Simon Watney "]}]}}
