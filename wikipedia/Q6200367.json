He also played two seasons in the American Soccer League, where he was the 1976 ASL leading scorer MVP, and two in the North American Soccer League.\nHinch began his professional career in 1969 with Tranmere Rovers in the Football League Third Division. On 10 February 1971, Tranmere transferred Hinch to fellow third division club Plymouth Argyle. In 1973, he then moved to Hereford United. In 1974, Hinch moved up to York City which had just won promotion to the Football League Second Division the previous season. He went on loan to fourth division Southport during March and April in the 1974\u20131975 season. In 1976 and again in 1977, Hinch went on loan to the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League. The Skyhawks were established in 1976, but ran to the league championship as Hinch led the league in scoring with thirteen goals and six assists in eighteen games. This led to Hinch's selection as League MVP. In 1977, Hinch finished second behind Jose Neto in scoring with eleven goals and thirteen assists, gaining him first team All Star recognition. York City transferred Hinch to Sheffield Wednesday for the 1977\u20131978 season, but he played only one game for Wednesday before moving to Barnsley F.C.  At the end of the season, Barnsley sold Hinch's contract to the California Surf of the North American Soccer League.
