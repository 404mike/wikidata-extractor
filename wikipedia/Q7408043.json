In the opening game of the 1886 Home Nations Championship, Treorchy provided the first 'Rhondda forward' when Sam Ramsey was selected to face England. Although Ramsey would only win two caps, and the second took a wait of eight years, Treorchy would provide several players throughout their history, including Billy Cleaver who would eventually play for the British Lions In 1907, Treorchy was accused of throwing a rugby game against Aberdare, which gave Aberdare the Glamorgan League title. The resulting enquiry by the WRU saw the permanent suspension of Treorchy's entire committee.Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pg 180 "]}, {"page": "1896 Home Nations Championship", "response": [";Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Cliff Bowen (Llanelli), Owen Badger (Llanelli), Arthur Gould (Newport) capt., Bert Dauncey (Newport), David Morgan (Llanelli), Ben Davies (Llanelli), Albert Jenkin (Swansea), Arthur Boucher (Newport), Ernie George (Pontypridd), Sam Ramsey (Treorchy), Harry Packer (Newport), Charles Nicholl (Llanelli), Frank Mills (Cardiff), Wallace Watts (Newport)"]}, {"page": "1904 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Bert Winfield (Cardiff), Teddy Morgan (London Welsh), Gwyn Nicholls (Cardiff) capt., Rhys Gabe (Llanelli), Willie Llewellyn (Newport), Dicky Owen (Swansea), Dick Jones (Swansea), Jehoida Hodges (Newport), Will Joseph (Swansea), John William Evans (Blaina), Arthur Harding (London Welsh), Alfred Brice (Aberavon), David John Thomas (Swansea), Sam Ramsey (Treorchy), George Boots (Newport)"]}, {"page": "Albert Jenkin", "response": ["At the start of the 1895/96 season, Jenkin was awarded the captaincy of the Swansea senior team, but was forced to give it up in November due to 'professional duties', and Billy Bancroft took over his duties.

The pack was almost identical to the previous match, with the only change seeing Treorchy's Sam Ramsey replacing the experienced but aging Jim Hannan. The game was a disaster for the Welsh team, with England winning the match 25\u20130, scoring seven tries without reply.

By 1895 the Welsh selectors began re-evaluating the needs of the Welsh pack, and began looking for a more physical style of player. These players would be able to jump and scrummage, but would also be able to take and hand out rough play.Griffiths (1987), 4:8.
