Born in England to an English father and Irish mother, he grew up in Ashton-under-Lyne before moving to Ireland, being raised in Cork, Dublin and his mother's native Wexford. He was active with the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Irish Volunteers, and participated in the Easter Rising in County Galway and the War of Independence. Elected as a TD to the First D\u00e1il, he rejected the Anglo-Irish Treaty. During the Irish Civil War Mellows was captured by Pro-Treaty forces after the surrender of the Four Courts in June 1922. On 8 December 1922 he was one of four senior IRA men executed by the Provisional Government.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Easter Rising", "response": ["In County Galway, 600\u2013700 Volunteers mobilised on Tuesday under Liam Mellows.

The most notorious example of this occurred at Ballyseedy, where nine Republican prisoners were tied to a landmine, which was detonated, killing eight and only leaving one, Stephen Fuller, who was blown clear by the blast, to escape."]}, {"page": "Finglas", "response": ["thumb|upright|Liam Mellows memorial"]}, {"page": "Fianna \u00c9ireann", "response": ["Members who reached seventeen years of age were recruited into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), and in 1912 Hobson started an IRB circle within the Fianna, named the John Mitchel Literary and Debating Society, whose members included Colbert, \u00d3 Riain, Heuston, Garry Holohan, Desmond Ryan, Liam Mellows and Barney Mellows.", "The Fianna was represented at all the garrisons that were involved in the fighting of the 1916 Easter Rising.

Heuston was given the task of commanding the Mendicity Institution, while Colbert was under the command of \u00c9amonn Ceannt at Watkins Brewery.

The executions of Rory O'Connor, Joe McKelvey, Liam Mellows and Dick Barrett became a symbol for the Fianna. They became known as \"The Four Martyrs\". A prominent ex-Fianna officer, Aodh MacNeill (son of Eoin MacNeill), officiated at the executions. Eamon Martin related that he was a cellmate of Mellows in Mountjoy Prison. Until 1964, an annual concert was held by the Fianna to commemorate their executions.
