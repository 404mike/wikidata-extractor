Whilst at Girton College, Cambridge, she joined socialist organisations including the Independent Labour Party, and went on to campaign for Women's Suffrage in Norwich. She became the \"Chief Organiser\" of the women's section of National Union of General Workers, before leaving to work as a housemaid at a London hotel, investigating the working conditions there.\nIn 1923, she was elected as Member of Parliament in one of Norwich's two seats, one of the earliest Labour women to do so. After causing some initial controversy by not wearing a hat to Parliament, she gave her maiden speech in support of reducing the age of suffrage for women from 30 to 21, to match that of men. She was also a member of committees looking into legal aid and adoption. She lost her seat in the 1924 general election, and went on to become president of the Women's Birth Control Group, then a councillor in Norwich City Council, where she ensured the building many of Norwich's parks.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hughes Hall, Cambridge", "response": ["|Dorothy Jewson"]}, {"page": "Margaret Bondfield", "response": ["In November 1923 Stanley Baldwin's Conservative Government fell.

She objected to being referred to as a \"woman MP\", and is said to have rejoined \"Why don't you call Churchill a man MP?\" She was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the President of the Board of Education. The minority government lasted only nine months; following the Zinoviev letter, the Labour Party lost the election of October 1924 and Lawrence was personally defeated.

It was founded in 1924, in the wake of the women's conference of the Labour Party, by a group which included Dora Russell, Frida Laski, and Dorothy Jewson. The group deliberately distanced itself from other existing birth control organisations, which were typically middle class and inspired by ideas of eugenics.", "Dora Russell and Leah L'Estrange Malone, seeking to emphasise the health costs to mothers without access to birth control advice and drawing on statistics concerning maternal deaths, coined the slogan: 'It is four times as dangerous to bear a child as to work in a mine, and mining is men's most dangerous trade.' A deputation to the Minister of Health, John Wheatley, in 1924 included Dorothy Jewson, H.G. Wells, and Dr Frances Huxley, a gynaecologist and birth control supporter. Calling for birth control advice to be given to those who requested it, and for physicians to be allowed to give such advice when medically advisable, their requests were rejected by Wheatley, a Catholic.", "At the 1924 Labour Party women's conference, a resolution on birth control was successfully passed, and shortly afterwards the Workers' Birth Control Group was formed. Key figures in the emergent organisation were prominent humanist activists Dora Russell, Frida Laski, and Ernest and Dorothy Thurtle, as well as Katharine Glasier, Susan Lawrence, Margaret Bonfield, and Dorothy Jewson. They used, as Jane Lewis has written, 'no justification other than the claim of all women as mothers to knowledge of matters concerning their health'. The Workers' Birth Control Group set themselves deliberately apart from Malthusian and eugenicist birth control groups, who they viewed as seeing the poor as inferior. H.G. Wells and Julian Huxley used their own public profiles to gain publicity for the campaign.", "* Dorothy Jewson (President)"]}]}}
