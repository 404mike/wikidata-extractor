He played most of his career for Rangers, and spent the latter part of his career with Sheffield Wednesday, in Hong Kong with Hong Kong Rangers and with Airdrieonians. He also featured at international level for Scotland.\nHenderson made his career debut in 1960 at the age of 16. He was a very pacy right-winger, and as he was only 5 feet 4 inches tall he became known as Wee Willie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rangers F.C.", "response": ["*  Willie Henderson \u2013 2006 Inductee"]}, {"page": "Hamilton, South Lanarkshire", "response": ["* Willie Henderson (Rangers, Sheffield Wednesday & Scotland footballer)"]}, {"page": "Baillieston", "response": ["* Willie Henderson - footballer "]}, {"page": "Jimmy Johnstone", "response": ["He made his international debut for the full Scottish international side on 3 October 1964 in a British Home Championship match against Wales, in place of Rangers winger Willie Henderson. He was involved in the move that led to Scotland's second goal, though the match ended in a 3\u20132 win for the Welsh. Johnstone's next cap came that same month in a World Cup qualifier at Hampden Park against Finland. Scotland won 3\u20131, but Johnstone's performance was unimpressive, with his passing described as \"lacking accuracy.\" Johnstone did not play for Scotland again until 2 April 1966, when he scored his first two international goals in a 4\u20133 defeat against England at Hampden Park. The first goal came with Scotland trailing 4\u20131, when he latched on to a pass from Denis Law and used his pace and power to run past the English defence and beat goalkeeper Gordon Banks from close range. He pulled back another goal for Scotland when he chased a floated ball towards goal from a Jim Baxter free kick and, from close range, scored with a powerful shot off the underside of the bar. Johnstone, along with Denis Law, was reported as one of Scotland's best performers, and his play resulted in England's Nobby Stiles being booked for a crushing tackle on him. Johnstone continued to play sporadically for Scotland, and he didn't score his next international goal until 22 October 1969 in a World Cup qualifier away against West Germany, Scotland losing 3\u20132.", "Having been diagnosed with incurable motor neuron disease (MND) five years earlier, Johnstone died in March 2006, aged 61. The last person to call him was old Rangers rival Willie Henderson, who had become a firm friend of Johnstone. Thousands of Celtic fans and fans of many other clubs, including those of arch-rivals Rangers, paid tribute to his memory outside Celtic Park on St Patrick's Day, the day of his funeral service. Tributes were paid to Johnstone before the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final, played between Celtic and Dunfermline. There was a minute of applause before the game and the entire Celtic squad wore the number 7 on their shorts in his honour."]}]}}
