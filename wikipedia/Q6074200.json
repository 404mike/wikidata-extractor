On Des' weekends off, the show was often co-presented by Reggie Yates. In September 1998, they launched a search for a new presenter (similar to the one that discovered Fearne a few years earlier). Viewers had the chance to vote for a winner in December 1998; the winner was Jack Stratton. Jack co-presented with Des and Fearne on both shows for a time, before becoming a solo presenter of pre-recorded inserts on the Sunday show. He was asked to leave the show due to end of contract, and in 2000 Fearne also left to concentrate on her other CITV series, the reins being handed over to Laura Jaye and Victoria Hickson. Des left the show in 2002 and GMTV relaunched the show as Diggin' It in January 2003, including a giant puppet named \"It\". Laura and Victoria also left and were replaced with Liam Dolan (previously a presenter on CBBC) and Abbie Pethullis, with voiceovers from Phil Gallagher."]}, {"page": "Grandpa in My Pocket", "response": ["* Phil Gallagher as Mr Liker Biker", "* Mr Liker-Biker (Phil Gallagher) The optimistic local biker who is more interested in the gear than actually cycling."]}, {"page": "Mister Maker", "response": ["Mister Maker is a British children's television series commissioned by Michael Carrington at the BBC for CBeebies.
