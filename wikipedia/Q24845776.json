The team first entered the national cup competition, the FA Cup, in 1909\u201310; they beat Withernsea 8\u20130 in the preliminary round before losing 4\u20130 to York City in the first qualifying round. In 1910, after amalgamating with North Lindsey United, the club took the name Scunthorpe & Lindsey United, and two years later, it became a member of the Midland League. The first team finished that initial season in the lower reaches of the table, but when competitive football resumed after the First World War, they enjoyed consecutive top-seven finishes, culminating in their first Midland League title in 1926\u201327, a success fuelled by 52 goals from former England international Ernie Simms. They again won the title in 1938\u201339, and it seemed for much of the season as if Harry Johnson was sure to overtake Simms' total, but he missed several matches in the later part of the season and had to settle for 49."]}]}}
