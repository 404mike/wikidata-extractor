There was even a guild set up in Philadelphia. The guild began as a male-only organisation, leading May Morris to start the Women\u2019s Guild of Arts in 1907 as an alternative for women. In 1914 the women's guild was allowed to use the meeting hall at Queens Square, but they were not allowed to have their roll call on the walls. There was great discussion between members about letting in women with Hamilton T. Smith writing to Arthur Llewellyn Smith in 1958 stated:  In the 1959 Annual Report, it stated that it was \"discussed at length but not put to the vote, it being felt that so revolutionary a proposal needed further careful discussion\". Further discussions occurred over the next few years, and in 1962 past master Brian Thomas asked:  It was not until 1964 that the brothers, at a special meeting, agreed to admit women to the guild. The first women to join was the wood engraver Joan Hassall who became the first female Master in 1972. In 1949, the members of the Junior Art Workers' Guild were invited to join the guild after their organisation closed down."]}, {"page": "Leonard Strong", "response": ["* Sixteen Portraits of People Whose Houses have been Preserved by the National Trust.

Some books are numbered, but the numbers are not always unique: at least nine are numbered 71 (Francis Bacon, Thomas Bewick, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Donne, Hilda Frank, Joan Hassall, Samuel Johnson, Bryan North Lee and the Rossettis) and six are numbered 85 (John Bunyan, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Edwards Lear, the Devil's Dictionary, The Dictionary of Parsons and Henry Vaughan).  It seems that Carr applied a partial numbering system retrospectively in the order in which he published the work of a poet.  For example, a later impression of the poems of Andrew Marvell is numbered 3, but no impressions of any small books numbered 1 or 2 have been seen while no small books numbered 4,5 or 6 have been seen but two are numbered 7 (Rupert Brooke/Wilfred Owen and William Barnes).  A few of the dictionaries list the impressions published but none of the books of poems list the printing history.  Carr mostly had 3,000 copies printed at a time, sometimes using a different background colour on the cover for a new impression. Carr is known to have published at least 102 small books in his series, most of which are listed below.
