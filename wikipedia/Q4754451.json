Rathbone initially turned the band down due to commitments with \"The DNA Cowboys \" and because he thought they played \"Britpop shite\". Also working as an Audi Car salesman at the time, he later had a change of heart after the band's bass player Stove King played him a demo of their new song \"Wide Open Space\".\nRathbone joined Mansun shortly before their debut album Attack of the Grey Lantern was finished. He was the third and final drummer in the band, brought in after the band had \"internal conflict\" with the previous members. Rathbone's initiation into the band was not without mishap; arriving for his first live gig with the band, flicking through a copy of the NME for details, Rathbone found he had got the wrong train and instead of the correct destination of Brighton, he had in fact arrived at Bristol Temple Meads. Shortly after, his first proper gig with the band was a televised appearance on Channel 4 show, TFI Friday, where the band performed \"Stripper Vicar\". The band released three studio album before splitting in 2003 whilst recording their fourth. Material from those session was released in 2004 as part of the Kleptomania boxset.\nFollowing the breakup of Mansun, Rathbone formed Seraphim with Jonti Thackray with whom he had been in bands with prior to Mansun, and has since played with several artists including Blondie tribute band Into the Bleach, The Jokers and World Upside Down. In 2013, he performed with folk band Green Smoke Hokum Band with accordion busker, Russell Mabbutt and soul-funk band Indio's Dream playing the percussive caj\u00f3n instrument.In 2008, Rathbone launched Rhythm Rehab, a short lived mobile drum teaching service covering Cheshire, Shropshire and North Wales.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chester", "response": ["* Andie Rathbone (born 1969), drummer of Chester-based indie band Mansun"]}, {"page": "Mansun", "response": ["Mansun were an English alternative rock band, formed in Chester in 1995.

Having auditioned several drummers without success, the band took a break at a local pub where \"there was the best rock drummer we'd ever seen, playing with this really dodgy band\", but the drummer, who was also working as an Audi car salesman at the time, initially rejected the bands pleas to join the band, as he thought the band played \"Britpop shite\". He changed his mind after King played him a demo of one of the band's latest songs, \"Wide Open Space\".

In 2011 Rathbone again confirmed his and Draper's desire to reform the band, but added that a reunion would have to include all four band members and that neither King nor Chad were interested.", "*Andie Rathbone \u2013 drums (1996\u20132003)"]}, {"page": "Little Kix", "response": ["* Andie Rathbone \u2013 drums, percussion"]}, {"page": "Six (Mansun album)", "response": ["*Andie Rathbone \u2013 drums, percussion"]}, {"page": "Kleptomania (album)", "response": ["* Andie Rathbone", "* Andie Rathbone \u2013 drums, percussion"]}, {"page": "Attack of the Grey Lantern", "response": ["According to Mansun's Kleptomania liner notes, frontman Paul Draper states that \"Take It Easy, Chicken\" was their first song and the band really did not know how to play their instruments, let alone play as a band, when DJs Steve Lamacq and John Peel started to play the song on BBC Radio 1.
