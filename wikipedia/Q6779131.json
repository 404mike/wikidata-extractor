She discovered that three quarters of patients with asthma also suffer from rhinitis (which they developed first). In 1992, she joined the management committee of the British Allergy Foundation (now known as Allergy UK) and she has served as a member of the Board of Trustees, is on the Clinical Advisory Board, and is its Vice-President.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brydon", "response": ["* Mary Brydon, British nurse"]}, {"page": "Mary Josephine Brydon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary Brydon"]}]}}
