He was the organist for Worcester Cathedral and wrote Anglican anthems.\nWhile Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal he took over Blackfriars Theatre in a business arrangement with producer Henry Evans and there he worked with Ben Jonson on a children's company. Giles had the power under a royal warrant to impress children for service in the Chapel Royal. He allowed Evans and others to use the warrant to legally abduct children not for service as choir boys, but to work in their theatre. When in 1600 they abducted the son of a nobleman, this led to the Clifton Star Chamber Case.He was also a master of the Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle and an organist at Westminster Abbey.\nHis Te Deum (Durham Cathedral manuscript A2, folio 56) has instructions for the organist to play an octave lower than written, and one assumes this is to give the 'dark' sonority of a 10 ft organ stop rather than the everyday colour of the standard 5 ft Principal stop of the Tudor organ. His Vestigia mea dirige was included in the manuscript collection known as the Dow Partbooks.\nHis son, Nathaniel Giles became a Canon of Windsor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1600 in literature", "response": ["*September \u2013 Richard Burbage leases the disused Blackfriars Theatre in London to Henry Evans and Nathaniel Giles for \u00a340 per year.

The company was absolutely forbidden to perform there. Three years later, Richard Burbage was able to lease the property to Henry Evans, who had been among those ejected more than fifteen years earlier. Evans entered a partnership with Nathaniel Giles, Hunnis's successor at the Chapel Royal. They used the theatre for a commercial enterprise with a group called the Children of the Chapel, which combined the choristers of the chapel with other boys, many taken up from local grammar schools under colour of Giles's warrant to provide entertainment for the Queen. The dubious legality of these dramatic impressments led to a challenge from a father in 1600; however, this method brought the company some of its most famous actors, including Nathaniel Field and Salmon Pavy.  The residents did not protest at this use, probably because of perceived social differences between the adult and child companies."]}, {"page": "List of Baroque composers", "response": ["* Nathaniel Giles (1558\u20131634)"]}, {"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["*Nathaniel Giles (c. 1558 \u2013 1634), also spelled Gyles"]}, {"page": "William Strachey", "response": ["In 1600 Richard Burbage leased to [Henry] Evans his Blackfriars property, and the Children of the Revels under Nathaniel Giles, with Evans as landlord and partner, occupied the theatre for some years.

Gibbons was the 2nd son, but eldest surviving, of Orlando and Elizabeth. Most information on the first 10 years of Gibbons' life is speculative. A 1663 letter from King Charles II suggests that Gibbons sang in the Chapel Royal under the direction of Nathaniel Giles. Gibbons likely studied music with his father and like encouraged to follow musical tradition of the family, resulting in him being Orlando Gibbons' only child to have a musical career. 4 months after Charles I ascended to the throne in 1625 Orlando would die on 5 June 1625, leaving Elizabeth, 10 year old Christopher and Orlando's other children to go live with their uncle Edward in Exeter."]}, {"page": "Henry Evans (theatre)", "response": ["In partnership with musician Nathaniel Giles, Evans obtained the lease of the Blackfriars property for the second time in 1599, after the building had been acquired by James Burbage, father of Richard and Cuthbert.

In consequence, it had been left empty for several years. Evans intended to use it to support a company of boys, as he had before 1590. By installing child \"choristers\", and setting aside part of building for their education, Evans could claim that the theatre was legally a school: one in which plays happened to be performed.Brian Jaycorrigan, Playhouse Law in Shakespeare's World, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2004, p.72. Evans apparently supplemented his choristers by taking talented children from local grammar schools, which he could do because his business partner Nathaniel Giles, Hunnis's successor at the Chapel Royal, had a warrant to provide performers for the queen's entertainment.
