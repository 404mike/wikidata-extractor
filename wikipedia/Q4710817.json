He also became a local councillor. In 1942, Midgley split away to form the Commonwealth Labour Party.  McElroy followed, and he stood for the party in Ards at the 1945 Northern Ireland general election.  He was one of the more successful candidates, taking 41.5% of the vote, but was not elected.  In 1947, Midgley disbanded the party and joined the Ulster Unionists.  McElroy was the most prominent of a small group of members who instead returned to the NILP.At the 1950 UK general election, McElroy stood for the NILP in North Down, receiving 20.6% of the votes cast, taking him to a distant second place.  He stood again in the 1951 general election, but fell back to 18.6%.McElroy became the Minister of the 1st Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church in Newtownards in 1954, a post he held until his death.In the 1950s, McElroy left the NILP, and founded the Ulster Liberal Party, of which he became leader.  He stood for his new party at the 1958 Northern Ireland general election for the Queen's University Belfast seat, but was narrowly defeated, taking fifth place in the four-seat constituency. At the 1964 UK general election, he stood in North Down, but was unable to match his performances for the NILP, taking only 6.2% of the votes cast. At the 1965 Stormont election, he was defeated in Enniskillen.McElroy's party colleague Sheelagh Murnaghan was elected for Queen's University in 1961 and re-elected in 1965, so when a by-election arose the following year, McElroy stood.  He was defeated in a close vote by the Ulster Unionist candidate.McElroy was active in the civil rights protests in the late 1960s, and spoke alongside Nationalist Party politicians such as Eddie McAteer and Austin Currie.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political parties in Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Albert McElroy ||19y ||Ulster Liberal Party 1956\u20131975 (?) ||"]}, {"page": "Ulster Liberal Party", "response": ["The party was re-founded by Albert McElroy in 1956, as (again) the Ulster Liberal Association.Fionnuala O'Connor, \"Pride of the Ulster Liberals\", The Guardian, 16 September 1993 From 1961 to 1969, the party had one seat in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, when Sheelagh Murnaghan held one of the four seats allocated to Queen's University, Belfast.

Se\u00e1n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus was amongst those in attendance of its inaugural meeting.  The stated aim of the party at its creation was to be part of an alliance of Liberals in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland who together would work for religious pluralism across the island in the face of the mounting tensions which would develop into the Troubles with a few years. Another raison d'\u00eatre cited for the creation of the party was the social conservatism experienced in Ireland at the time, with speakers suggests the three major Irish parties (Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and Labour) were all contributing to that atmosphere. Both the Ulster and Irish Liberals agreed the Republic should embrace the European identify and push towards membership of the EEC."]}]}}
