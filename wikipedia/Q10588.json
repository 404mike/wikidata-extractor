He played for Barnet, Gillingham, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest before moving to Watford in 2005. At Watford he was the Football League Championship top scorer, and was voted Watford player of the season as the club earned promotion to the Premier League. King joined Wigan Athletic in 2008, and subsequently spent loan spells at Hull City and Middlesbrough. He joined Coventry City in September 2010, following his release from prison, and made 29 appearances for the club before controversially switching to Birmingham City in June 2011. He made 79 appearances for Birmingham, before suffering a series of injuries during the 2012\u201313 season that prevented him from playing again, leaving the club in August 2013 by mutual consent. King has also played and scored for the Jamaica national team.\nKing has served three jail sentences, and has a number of other criminal convictions including: theft from a person and from a car, criminal damage, and attempting to obtain property by deception; fraudulent use of vehicle licence document, driving without insurance, speeding, drink driving; a wounding incident while playing amateur football, and two cases involving assault of young women rejecting his advances in the Soho area of London. King had his playing contract cancelled by Wigan after being convicted of the sexual assault charges and being sentenced to eighteen months in prison.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 26", "response": ["*  1980   \u2013 Marlon King, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1980", "response": ["** Marlon King, Jamaican footballer"]}, {"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  Marlon King", "|  Marlon King 13"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 in English football", "response": ["*10 May 2002 - Marlon King, 22-year-old Gillingham striker, is jailed for 18 months for driving a stolen car."]}, {"page": "EFL Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Marlon King"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 in English football", "response": ["Leading goalscorer: Marlon King (Watford) \u2013 21"]}, {"page": "2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)", "response": ["* Marlon King"]}, {"page": "Deon Burton", "response": ["His good form for Wednesday led to a recall to the international stage.

Good form for Sheffield Wednesday meant that he was recalled for a friendly match against Trinidad and Tobago on 27 March 2008. He came on as a second-half substitute for Marlon King in a 2\u20132 draw. He kept his place in the squad for the next friendly game against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 3 June, again coming off the bench for King in the second half, to score his side's fourth goal a minute later and also to cross for Ricardo Gardner to score the fifth and final goal in the 87th minute of a 5\u20131 victory."]}, {"page": "Peter Ramage", "response": ["On 29 February 2012, Ramage signed for Championship club Birmingham City on an emergency loan until the end of the season. He made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20132 draw against Derby County on 3 March 2012. In a follow\u2013up match against Coventry City, Ramage set up an equalising goal for Marlon King to help Birmingham City draw 1\u20131. Since joining the club, he quickly established himself in the first team, playing in either the left\u2013back position and right\u2013back position. Ramage made three separate statements on helping Birmingham City reach the play\u2013offs and aim to help the club reach the Premier League, as he previously did with Queens Park Rangers. However, Ramage played in both legs of the semi\u2013finals of the Championship play\u2013offs against Blackpool, as Birmingham City lost 3\u20132 against Blackpool on aggregate. Having played in every match since joining the club throughout the 2011\u201312 season, he went on to make sixteen appearances. Following this, Ramage returned to his parent club."]}, {"page": "Nathan Ellington", "response": ["On 29 August 2007, Ellington joined Watford on a four-year deal. Watford paid a then club record \u00a33.25\u00a0million for the striker, a fee that could rise to \u00a34.25\u00a0million depending on appearances. He made his Watford debut three days later, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2\u20130 win over Ipswich Town, hitting the post a few minutes after entering the field. Ellington initially found it difficult to command a place in the Watford starting line-up due to the excellent form of Darius Henderson and Marlon King, and his first goal for Watford did not come until he scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Charlton Athletic on 19 January 2008, and went on to score a further 2 goals in 3 games, but then did not score again until 5 April against Coventry, his last of the season.

In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, \u017digi\u0107 took on the responsibility.
