In 1975, he played Mick in Survivors.\nHowever, his big break happened in 1979 when he was cast as Tom Arnold, a cabin boy, in The Onedin Line. This was followed by the lead role in Thames Television\u2019s, BAFTA award nominated, adaptation of Stig of the Dump - which 'is probably the part I am most remembered for'.Keith went on to play 'Boxer Reed' in all 54 episodes of Central TV's kid's drama, Murphy's Mob. His appearance as Will Chandler - 'one of the most convincing and memorable companions The Doctor never had' \u2013 in Doctor Who serial The Awakening, led producer John Nathan-Turner to briefly consider making Keith a series regular.Typecasting (often as a yokel) persuaded Keith to study for a certificate in Finance and Investment. This coincided with a dark period his life, when his earlier health problems came back to haunt him. 'As a result of the growth hormone treatment I received as a child, I received a letter from the NHS saying I may have contracted CJD.'Keith's high-profile saw him interviewed on ITN, a broadcast that curtailed his acting career. 'The fact that it was reported that I was dying did not help me get any further work as no casting director is going to employ you if there is a chance you will keel over before episode two.'Having run a financial services business for the last 22 years, Keith is planning on a return to acting. Looking for an agent he has already made a brief return to television, as a guest in the 'Blast From The Past' section of The Justin Lee Collins Show.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Survivors (1975 TV series)", "response": ["* Keith Jayne as Mick (ep. 4)"]}, {"page": "The Onedin Line", "response": ["Other featured cast members included Philip Bond (Albert Frazer), Edward Chapman (Thomas Callon), James Warwick (Edmund Callon), John Phillips (Jack Frazer), Caroline Harris (Caroline Maudslay), James Hayter (Captain Joshua Webster), Ken Hutchison (Matt Harvey), Laura Hartong (Charlotte Onedin), Marc Harrison (William Frazer), Christopher Douglas (Samuel Onedin), Roberta Iger (Margarita Onedin), Jenny Twigge (Caroline Onedin), Cyril Shaps (Braganza), Hilda Braid (Miss Simmonds), David Garfield (Samuel Plimsoll), Robert James (Rowland Biddulph), Sylvia Coleridge (Mrs Salt), Sonia Dresdel (Lady Lazenby), Nicolette Roeg (Ada Gamble), John Rapley (Dunwoody), Stephanie Bidmead (Mrs Darling), John Sharp (Uncle Percy Spendilow), Heather Canning (Mrs Arkwright), Keith Jayne (Tom Arnold), Frederick Jaeger (Max van der Rheede), Edward Judd (Manuel Ortega), Elizabeth Chambers (Miss Gladstone), Jack Watson (Dr Darling), Paul Lavers (Francis Polter/David Teal) and Maurice Colbourne (Viscount Marston)."]}, {"page": "Jayne", "response": ["*Keith Jayne (born 1960), a British television actor"]}, {"page": "The Beastly Hun", "response": ["*Keith Jayne - Wilfred Schoenfeld"]}, {"page": "List of science fiction films of the 1970s", "response": ["|The Glitterball||Harley Cockliss||Ben Buckton, Keith Jayne, Ron Pember||United Kingdom||"]}, {"page": "The Justin Lee Collins Show", "response": ["| 5 || 16 April 2009 || Alan Carr, Carol McGiffin, Andrea McLean, Chris O'Dowd || Keith Jayne from Stig of the Dump || 480,000"]}, {"page": "Barbara Speake Stage School", "response": ["* Actor Keith Jayne, star of Murphy's Mob and Stig of the Dump"]}, {"page": "The Glitterball", "response": ["*Keith Jayne as Pete"]}, {"page": "BBC2 Playhouse", "response": ["| Billie WhitelawAnthony BateKeith JayneSarah Prince"]}, {"page": "Murphy's Mob", "response": ["* Keith Jayne as Boxer"]}]}}
