He was also an officer in the Royal Air Force Special Reserve, and the Auxiliary Air Force.  \nAlthough he qualified as a mining engineer the lure of flying proved too strong, and he did not enter the family mining company.  During the war he became an important test pilot for aircraft manufacturer Hawker Siddeley.  Having tested some of the early jet aircraft, he retired from test flying in 1948, becoming a sales executive for Hawker. He is the grandfather of British television presenter Kate Humble.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hawker Tempest", "response": ["During early 1943, a production line for the Tempest Mk.V was established in Hawker's Langley facility, alongside the existing manufacturing line for the Hawker Hurricane. Production was initially slow, claimed to be due to issues encountered with the rear spar. On 21 June 1943, the first production Tempest V, JN729, rolled off the production line and its maiden flight was conducted by test pilot Bill Humble.Mason 1991, p. 333.", "The original Tempest V prototype, HM595, was extensively modified to serve as the Tempest VI prototype. On 9 May 1944, HM595 made its first flight after its rebuild, flown by Bill Humble. In December 1944, HM595 was dispatched to Khartoum, Egypt to conduct a series of tropical trials. During 1945, a further two Tempest V aircraft, EJ841 and JN750, were converted to the Tempest VI standard in order to participate in service trials at RAF Boscombe Down."]}, {"page": "Hawker Siddeley", "response": ["*Bill Humble"]}, {"page": "Test pilot", "response": ["*Bill Humble"]}, {"page": "Hawker Sea Hawk", "response": ["On 2 September 1947, the P.1040 prototype, VP401, sometimes referred to as the Hawker N.7/46 after the related naval specification, conducted its maiden flight from RAF Boscombe Down, piloted by Bill Humble.James 2002, p. 48. Three days later, VP401 flew to Farnborough to continue trials.Mason 1966, pp. 4-5. A month after the first flight, the existence of the P.1040 was revealed to the general public.Mason 1966, p. 5. Early flight trials encountered aerodynamically-related teething problems, such as airframe vibrations and tail buffeting, which led to a redesign of the rear jet pipe fairings and the addition of a bullet-shaped anti-shock body on the tail. Other minor issues were addressed, including high stick forces and windscreen distortion; VP401 needed long take-off runs which were attributed to the \"low-thrust\" Nene 1.James 2002, pp. 48, 50. The Nene 2/Mk.101 for production aircraft would have a higher take-off thrust."]}, {"page": "Roland Beamont", "response": ["When his tour of duty ended in December 1941, he was offered the position of Leigh-Mallory's personal aide. Instead, he chose to keep flying and to accept a position as a production test pilot at Hawker's. While he had 800 hours flying Hurricanes he was by his own admission, ignorant of the problems of aircraft stability, trim and control balance.
