He was also an officer in the Royal Air Force Special Reserve, and the Auxiliary Air Force.  \nAlthough he qualified as a mining engineer the lure of flying proved too strong, and he did not enter the family mining company.  During the war he became an important test pilot for aircraft manufacturer Hawker Siddeley.  Having tested some of the early jet aircraft, he retired from test flying in 1948, becoming a sales executive for Hawker. He is the grandfather of British television presenter Kate Humble.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
