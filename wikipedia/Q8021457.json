The South Africans were rampant in Wales, winning the test match and all six club matches, though gained few supporters due to the kicking tactics Osler employed.  The New Zealander's received a better welcome, and after the previous tour where the tourist went unbeaten the Welsh press were hoping for a return of the spirit that won the first encounter in 1905. Before the match with Wales, New Zealand were to face eight club teams over six games. After winning the opening three English county matches and then beating a joint Abertillery and Cross Keys the All Blacks were showing the same form shown in their first two tours, but then stumbled against Swansea. Swansea were not in a period of particular growth and the only two players showing any flair were Wales Schoolboy players Willie Davies and Haydn Tanner. During the game Merv Corner could not contain the attacking bursts from Tanner, the New Zealand flankers were drawn in which in turned allowed Davies the freedom to run which Claude Davey finished off with two tries. Jack Manchester's response to the Swansea win was to ask the New Zealand press \"Tell them we have been beaten, but don't tell them it was by a pair of schoolboys\". This win gave Swansea the honour of being the first club team to have beaten all three major Southern Hemisphere touring teams. The All Blacks were unbeaten in the next twenty matches, but lost to Wales in a classic game which Wales managed to win in the last ten minutes of the game after the Welsh hooker, Don Tarr, was stretchered off with a broken neck."]}, {"page": "Wales national rugby league team", "response": ["*2003 Jonathan Davies, Willie Davies"]}, {"page": "2002 in Wales", "response": ["*26 September - Willie Davies, Wales international rugby union and league player, 86"]}, {"page": "London Welsh RFC", "response": ["*  Willie Davies"]}, {"page": "William Davies", "response": ["*Willie Davies (footballer) (1900\u20131953), Swansea Town F.C., Cardiff City F.C., Notts County F.C.,Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*Willie Davies (1916\u20132002), Welsh dual-code rugby footballer"]}, {"page": "Lance Todd Trophy", "response": ["| Willie Davies"]}, {"page": "Penclawdd", "response": ["Penclawdd RFC, nicknamed the Donks, have a long history in rugby union.

In its formative years the club had no permanent pitch, but played on suitable available ground in various areas of the village. Haydn Tanner is one of the club's most famous players, playing for Wales and the British Lions in 1938.

While playing with the 'All Whites' he faced several touring teams including the M\u0101oris, the Waratahs, South Africa and New Zealand. In the game against New Zealand in 1935, Edgar led the Swansea team as club captain in a notable victory over one of the most impressive rugby teams of the day. Known by many as the game in which schoolboys Willie Davies and Claude Davey 'beat' the All Blacks, the contribution of Long and the rest of the forwards is often forgotten. In the second half of the game, Long switched the play of his pack into adopting 'spoiling' tactics, matching the New Zealand's own often physical style, in an attempt to slow the game down. The tactics succeeded but resulted in 'unpardonable scenes' in which both sides switched to fist fighting as players tired towards the end of the game.Billot (1972), pg 91. The win for Swansea gave them the record of being the first team to beat all three major Southern hemisphere teams. While club captain during the 1935/36 season, Long was also the season's top points scorer.1935-35 Season Swansea RFC archives"]}, {"page": "Welsh Sports Hall of Fame", "response": ["* Willie Davies (Rugby League / Union) *"]}]}}
