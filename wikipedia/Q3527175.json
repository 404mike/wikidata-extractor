A Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1897, he was described as \"far and away the greatest cricketer Warwickshire has yet produced.\"\nLilley made his debut for Warwickshire CCC in 1888, before they were a first-class county, and played for them continuously until 1911, making his test debut against Australia at Lord's in 1896. Lilley last played for Warwickshire in July 1911, retiring in \"early August\" and the county went on to win the championship that year. His place was taken by Tiger Smith who played for Warwickshire until 1930. After his retirement, Lilley settled in Bristol and was a member of the special advisory committee which helped to re-establish Gloucestershire CCC after the Great War.The conservative cricket establishment of the time was not effusive in its appreciation of this great keeper mainly because he broke with the tradition of standing up to the faster bowlers as was practised by all the great keepers till then. He did so on the advice of W. G. Grace who, on seeing him standing up to Tom Richardson, the legendary England fast bowler, suggested that he would \"do better by standing back\", which Lilley did for the rest of his career.He was renowned for his cricketing knowledge, and advised \"a long succession of England captains\". However, he once started to set the field without consulting his county skipper, Frank Foster, 23 years his junior, who told him there and then to mind his own business. Foster later advised the Warwickshire committee to drop him.\"As a wicketkeeper he was most consistent and so pronounced an artist that at the end of his career his hands and fingers showed scarcely a trace of the heavy strain to which they had been subjected in taking bowling of all descriptions.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1900s (decade)", "response": ["*Dick Lilley"]}, {"page": "1896 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Cricketers of the Season \u2013 Syd Gregory, Dick Lilley, K S Ranjitsinhji, Tom Richardson, Hugh Trumble"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Dick Lilley"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["*    Dick Lilley"]}, {"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Dick Lilley \u2013 England and Warwickshire Cricketer"]}, {"page": "History of the West Indian cricket team", "response": ["The tours to England continued in 1906 when Harold Austin led a West Indian side to England. His side played a number of county teams, and drew their game against an \"England XI\". However, that England XI only included one contemporary Test player \u2013 wicketkeeper Dick Lilley \u2013 and he had not been on England's most recent tour, their 1905\u20136 tour of South Africa. The Marylebone Cricket Club, which had taken over responsibility for arranging all official overseas England tours, visited the West Indies in 1910\u201311, and 1912\u201313 but after that there was no international cricket of any note until the West Indian team went to England in 1923. This tour did not include a game against an England team, but there was an end-of-season game against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI against a virtual England Test side at the Scarborough cricket festival, a traditional end-of-season game against a touring side at the English seaside resort of Scarborough, which Leveson-Gower's XI won by only four wickets. 1925\u201326 saw another MCC tour of the West Indies."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket hat-tricks", "response": ["* Dick Lilley (lbw)"]}, {"page": "Lilley", "response": ["* Dick Lilley (1866\u20131929), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Herbert Strudwick", "response": ["Born in Mitcham, Surrey, Strudwick took to wicket-keeping, apparently on the advice of a local lady, at the age of ten. He first played for Surrey in a few games in 1902, but during his first full season the following year dismissed a record 91 batsmen (71 catches and 20 stumpings) \u2013 a feat made more remarkable by the decline of Surrey's top fast bowlers Tom Richardson and William Lockwood and the exceptionally wet weather of that summer. From that time on, Strudwick became regarded as the natural successor to Dick Lilley as England's Test wicket-keeper, and he toured Australian in 1903/1904 without playing a Test."]}, {"page": "Clem Hill", "response": ["For the first time under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team travelled to Australia for the 1903\u201304 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two. Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276\u00a0runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings. In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a \"very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [crowd] demonstration\". Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground. The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting \"Crock!, Crock!, Crock!\" Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground. Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216\u00a0runs.", "An excellent fielder in the deep, Hill had a powerful throwing arm. During a match at Leeds during the 1902 tour of England, he threw a ball from near the boundary, knocking down the stumps at one end and rebounding to hit the stumps the other end. During the same tour at Old Trafford, Hill made a catch that Wisden claimed \"will never be forgotten by [those present]\". A Dick Lilley hit to square leg looked likely to clear the boundary. Hill himself said he raced  for it with a view simply to save a boundary. In the event, he ran round 'close to the boundary' from his position at long on, aided by the wind seemingly holding up the ball to take the catch low down in front of the pavilion in his outstretched hands; one that Wisden said \"few fieldsmen would have thought worth attempting\"."]}, {"page": "Hugh Trumble", "response": ["After playing in one Test match against the South African team on a stopover when returning from England to Australia, Trumble retired from Test cricket, aged 35. When Australia lost to the English tourists in the First Test in Sydney in 1903\u201304, Trumble was persuaded to return for the Second Test under the captaincy of Noble. He was immediately successful taking 4\u00a0wickets for 107\u00a0runs in the first innings and 5 for 34 in the second, but was unable to prevent England from winning the Test by 185\u00a0runs Selected for the remaining four Tests, his 24\u00a0wickets in four\u00a0Tests made Trumble the most successful Australian bowler in the series. The writer Roland Perry described Trumble's final Test match as \"the most dramatic and memorable farewell performance ever by a bowler\". In front of his home town supporters in Melbourne, he took 7\u00a0wickets for 28\u00a0runs, including a hat-trick, to bowl Australia to victory; Wisden describing his bowling in the second innings as \"practically unplayable\". The hat-trick, his second in Test cricket, consisted of the dismissals of Bernard Bosanquet, Plum Warner and Dick Lilley on 7 March. He went on to take the wicket of Ted Arnold, ending the match and his career in international cricket."]}, {"page": "1896 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five Cricketers of the Season) - Syd Gregory, Dick Lilley, K S Ranjitsinhji, Tom Richardson, Hugh Trumble)"]}, {"page": "Birmingham and District Premier League", "response": ["* Dick Lilley"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Dick Lilley \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Tiger Smith", "response": ["Ernest James \"Tiger\" Smith (6 February 1886 \u2013 31 August 1979) was an English wicket-keeper who played in 11 Tests from 1911/1912 to 1914.
