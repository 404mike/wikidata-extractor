A Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1897, he was described as \"far and away the greatest cricketer Warwickshire has yet produced.\"\nLilley made his debut for Warwickshire CCC in 1888, before they were a first-class county, and played for them continuously until 1911, making his test debut against Australia at Lord's in 1896. Lilley last played for Warwickshire in July 1911, retiring in \"early August\" and the county went on to win the championship that year. His place was taken by Tiger Smith who played for Warwickshire until 1930. After his retirement, Lilley settled in Bristol and was a member of the special advisory committee which helped to re-establish Gloucestershire CCC after the Great War.The conservative cricket establishment of the time was not effusive in its appreciation of this great keeper mainly because he broke with the tradition of standing up to the faster bowlers as was practised by all the great keepers till then. He did so on the advice of W. G. Grace who, on seeing him standing up to Tom Richardson, the legendary England fast bowler, suggested that he would \"do better by standing back\", which Lilley did for the rest of his career.He was renowned for his cricketing knowledge, and advised \"a long succession of England captains\". However, he once started to set the field without consulting his county skipper, Frank Foster, 23 years his junior, who told him there and then to mind his own business. Foster later advised the Warwickshire committee to drop him.\"As a wicketkeeper he was most consistent and so pronounced an artist that at the end of his career his hands and fingers showed scarcely a trace of the heavy strain to which they had been subjected in taking bowling of all descriptions.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
