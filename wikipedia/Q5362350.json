Critics at the time compared her to Maria Malibran and commented on the remarkable purity and sweetness of her voice,  which extended to nearly three octaves. Although trained in England, she was considered a supreme representative of the florid Italian singing style.Austin was born in Leicester. Her performances in Dublin in 1821 led to engagements at the English Opera House and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane where she debuted on November 23, 1822. Austin made her American debut on December 10, 1827 as Rosetta in Thomas Arne\u2019s Love in a Village at the Chestnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. She sang the same role for her New York City debut at the Park Theatre on January 2, 1828. Following her performances there, one New York critic described her voice as \"liquid tones coming as softly on the sense of hearing as snow upon the waters, or dew upon the flowers\".During the next seven years, guided by her manager (and lover), F.H.F. Berkeley, she toured the eastern half of the United States extensively, appearing in both operas and concerts. She starred in several American premieres, including  Arne's  Artaxerxes and the English versions of Auber's Fra Diavolo and Boieldieu's The White Lady and The Caliph of Baghdad.Following the arrival in America of the Scottish soprano Mary Anne Paton Wood in late 1833, Austin's popularity began to wane. Her last performance was on May 8, 1835 at the Bowery Theater in New York as Diana Vernon in Isaac Pocock's Rob Roy Macgregor. Shortly afterwards, she returned to England and retired from the stage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Artaxerxes (opera)", "response": ["By 1790, Artaxerxes had received well over 100 performances, including 48 in Dublin alone between 1765 and 1767. In the United States, the overture was played in Philadelphia as early as 1765, while arias from the opera were heard in New York City in 1767. The US premiere of the complete opera came on 31 January 1828 at the Park Theatre in New York City with a cast that included Elizabeth Austin as Semira. Artaxerxes remained in the London repertoire for over 70 years with regular revivals including those at the Drury Lane Theatre (1780, 1820, 1827, and 1828), Covent Garden (1813, 1827, and 1828), and the St James's Theatre (1836). The score for Artaxerxes had been published in 1762. However, it did not contain the recitatives or the final chorus. The original performing version of the score was lost in the fire that destroyed the Theatre Royal in 1808. After that date, performances of the work used a shortened version reconstructed by Henry Bishop and John Addison in 1813."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Austin (singer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Austin (soprano)"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Austin", "response": ["Elizabeth Austin may refer to:", "*Elizabeth Austin (writer) (born 1958), American writer", "*Elizabeth Austin (soprano) (1800\u2013?), English opera singer and actress", "*Elizabeth Austin (Australian pioneer) (1821\u20131910), Australian pioneer and philanthropist"]}]}}
