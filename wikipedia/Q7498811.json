In: New Musical Express 27 January 1979, page 43. Managed by Shirley O'Loughlin, the band went on their first UK tour with Swiss female band Kleenex, in May 1979 after Rough Trade Records released their first single, \"Fairytale in the Supermarket\". Johnny Rotten was an early admirer of the band, and later stated: \"The Raincoats offered a completely different way of doing things, as did X-Ray Spex and all the books about punk have failed to realise that these women were involved for no other reason than that they were good and original\". The Raincoats' distinctly uncommercial sound did not appeal to everyone; after witnessing an early performance by the band, Danny Baker remarked that \"they are so bad that every time a waiter drops a tray we'd all get up and dance\"."]}, {"page": "The Raincoats (album)", "response": ["* Shirley O'Loughlin \u2013 photography"]}, {"page": "Odyshape", "response": ["*Dick O\u2019Dell, Shirley O'Loughlin, Kadir Durvesh Shehnai, Ingrid Weiss \u2013 percussion"]}, {"page": "Looking in the Shadows", "response": ["*Shirley O'Loughlin \u2013 photography"]}, {"page": "The Sound of the Sand and Other Songs of the Pedestrian", "response": ["* Shirley O'Loughlin\u00a0\u2013 assistant producer"]}, {"page": "Ruth Polsky", "response": ["Starting in 1979, Polsky was talent buyer first at HurrahJoe, R.: Disco Forum Report: Keys to Successful Programming Are Mulled, pg. 48, Billboard, August 16, 1980 and then Danceteria in New York, also promoting shows at The Ritz and booking bands out across the U.S. In this role, she was crucial in breaking many, particularly UK-based, post-punk acts in the U.S., including tours for The Smiths, New Order, Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, The Only Ones, The Sisters of Mercy, The Birthday Party, Cocteau Twins, and The Chameleons.
