He is known for his innovative thinking in the fields of urban planning and sociology.\nFollowing the philosophies of Auguste Comte and Frederic LePlay, he introduced the concept of \"region\" to architecture and planning and coined the term \"conurbation\". Later, he elaborated \"neotechnics\" as the way of remaking a world apart from over-commercialization and money dominance.An energetic Francophile, Geddes was the founder in 1924 of the Coll\u00e8ge des \u00c9cossais (Scots College), an international teaching establishment in Montpellier, France and in the 1920s he bought the Ch\u00e2teau d'Assas to set up a centre for urban studies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edinburgh", "response": ["Despite an enduring myth to the contrary, Edinburgh became an industrial centre with its traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continuing to grow in the 19th century and joined by new industries such as rubber works, engineering works and others. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken by Glasgow as Scotland's largest city. The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates. Improvements carried out under Lord Provost William Chambers in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly Victorian Old Town seen today. More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of Patrick Geddes, but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major slum clearance in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed the George Square and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial."]}, {"page": "October 2", "response": ["*1854 \u2013 Patrick Geddes, Scottish biologist, sociologist, geographer, and philanthropist (d. 1932)"]}, {"page": "Social geography", "response": ["The first person in the Anglo-American tradition to use the term \"social geography\" was George Wilson Hoke, whose paper The Study of Social GeographyHoke, G.

Le Play's work, however, was taken up in Britain by Patrick Geddes and Andrew John Herbertson. Percy M. Roxby, a former student of Herbertson, in 1930 identified social geography as one of human geography's four main branches.Roxby, P. M. (1930): The Scope and Aims of Human Geography. Scottish Geographical Journal 46 (5): 276-290 [283]. By contrast, the American academic geography of that time was dominated by the Berkeley School of Cultural Geography led by Carl O.

Geddes's plan for developing the northern part of the district was based on Ebenezer Howard's garden city movement. While most of the northern area of Tel Aviv was built according to this plan, the influx of European refugees in the 1930s necessitated the construction of taller apartment buildings on a larger footprint in the city.", "Tel Aviv is home to different architectural styles that represent influential periods in its history. The early architecture of Tel Aviv consisted largely of European-style single-storey houses with red-tiled roofs. Neve Tzedek, the first neighbourhood to be built outside of Jaffa, is characterised by two-storey sandstone buildings. By the 1920s, a new eclectic Orientalist style came into vogue, combining European architecture with Eastern features such as arches, domes and ornamental tiles. Municipal construction followed the \"garden city\" master plan drawn up by Patrick Geddes. Two- and three-storey buildings were interspersed with boulevards and public parks.", "* Catherine Weill-Rochant, Le travail de Patrick Geddes \u00e0 Tel-Aviv, un plan d'ombre et de lumi\u00e8re, Saarbr\u00fccken, \u0629ditions Universitaires Europ\u00e9ennes, May 2010."]}, {"page": "Theories of urban planning", "response": ["Patrick Geddes (1864-1932) was the founder of regional planning. His main influences were the geographers \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus and Paul Vidal de La Blache, as well as the sociologist Pierre Guillaume Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric le Play. From these he received the idea of the natural region. According to Geddes, planning must start by surveying such a region by crafting a \"Valley Section\" which shows the general slope from mountains to the sea that can be identified across scale and place in the world, with the natural environment and the cultural environments produced by it included. This was encapsulated in the motto \"Survey before Plan\". He saw cities as being changed by technology into more regional settlements, for which he coined the term conurbation. Similar to the garden city movement, he also believed in adding green areas to these urban regions. The Regional Planning Association of America advanced his ideas, coming up with the 'regional city' which would have a variety of urban communities across a green landscape of farms, parks and wilderness with the help of telecommunication and the automobile. This had major influence on the County of London Plan, 1944.", "Patrick Geddes had first advocated for the \"real and active participation\" of citizens when working in the British Raj, arguing against the \"Dangers of Municipal Government from above\" which would cause \"detachment from public and popular feeling, and consequently, before long, from public and popular needs and usefulness\". Further on, self-build was researched by Raymond Unwin in the 1930s in his Town Planning in Practice. The Italian anarchist architect Giancarlo De Carlo then argued in 1948 that \"\u201cThe housing problem cannot be solved from above. It is a problem of the people, and it will not be solved, or even boldly faced, except by the concrete will and action of the people themselves\", and that planning should exist \"as the manifestation of communal collaboration\". Through the Architectural Association School of Architecture, his ideas caught John Turner, who started working in Peru with Eduardo Neira. He would go on working in Lima from the mid-'50s to the mid-'60s. There he found that the barrios were not slums, but were rather highly organised and well-functioning. As a result, he came to the conclusion that:\"When dwellers control the major decisions and are free to make their own contributions in the design, construction or management of their housing, both this process and the environment produced stimulate individual and social well-being. When people have no control over nor responsibility for key decisions in the housing process, on the other hand, dwelling environments may instead become a barrier to personal fulfillment and a burden on the economy.\"The role of the government was to provide a framework within which people would be able to work freely, for example by providing them the necessary resources, infrastructure and land. Self-build was later again taken up by Christopher Alexander, who led a project called People Rebuild Berkeley in 1972, with the aim to create \"self-sustaining, self-governing\" communities, though it ended up being closer to traditional planning.", "* Cities in Evolution, Patrick Geddes, 1915"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Patrick Geddes (1854\u20131932), Scottish biologist, sociologist, geographer and pioneering town planner"]}, {"page": "Jane Jacobs", "response": ["* Cities in Evolution, Sir Patrick Geddes"]}, {"page": "John Ruskin", "response": ["Pioneers of town planning such as Thomas Coglan Horsfall and Patrick Geddes called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in justification of their own social interventions; likewise the founders of the garden city movement, Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin.Michael H.
