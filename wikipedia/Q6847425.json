The key aim was to gain automatic promotion and that was a task that had so far in the first half of the season been greatly helped by on loan winger Ben Marshall, who had probably been the best player for The Owls so far. However, the thing on all the fans' minds was Marshall's future at the club, as his loan from Stoke City was due to end during the middle of the month and his contract at Stoke City due to end in the summer. Only being 20 years of age, it was made clear by Gary Megson, known to be great friends with Stoke City manager Tony Pulis, the outcome would either be that 'Marshall will either sign a new contract at Stoke City and hopefully come back on loan to us (Sheffield Wednesday) or another club will snap him up and buy him'. Wednesday had a match to concentrate on however and their first game of 2012 came at home to Tranmere Rovers. The home game was first of four in a row for Wednesday. Sheffield Wednesday got off to a great start when Reda Johnson scored on just the second minute, then five minutes later Chris Lines scored his first home goal of the club to put The Owls 2\u20130 up. The game relaxed after this until the eighty-second minute when Ian Goodison scored from a corner to put a nervous last ten minutes of the game, with Sheffield Wednesday losing points in the final minutes of games just weeks earlier. However, Sheffield Wednesday managed to hold on and the game finished 2\u20131. On the Thursday after this game left back Mark Reynolds who had played only a few games since he joined the club at the beginning of the season was sent out on loan till the end of the season to Aberdeen. Sheffield Wednesday faced top of the Football League Championship West Ham United in the FA Cup the following weekend. Both teams made changes and was a very tight encounter even though the odds were stacked up on West Ham United to go through to the next round. It took a late goal to separate the sides when Chris O'Grady scored with two minutes to go of the ninety and sent Sheffield Wednesday through to the next round of the competition. The next day Sheffield Wednesday found they would be playing Blackpool away in Round 4 of the competition. With the transfer market open for the January month The Owls made their first signing when Miguel Llera, who had signed on loan for the month previously, signed on a two-year contract on a free transfer from Blackpool. Also, the club saw the introduction of Mike Jones a winger signed on an undisclosed fee for two-and-a-half years from fellow League One club Bury. In terms of departures, the club saw three when young goalkeeper Sean Cuff was sent out on loan to Cambridge United for a month, out-of-contract James O'Connor left for American club Orlando City, and Giles Coke went back on loan to Bury for the rest of the season. Back to matches and Sheffield Wednesday faced their toughest opponent of the season so far when the played top of the league Charlton Athletic at home, Charlton Athletic were five points clear of second place Sheffield Wednesday and had not dropped from the top of the league since October. The first goal was largely expected to be the key goal and the team who would go on to win the game. Sheffield Wednesday, unbeaten at home throughout the season and only having two draws at Hillsborough Stadium, started slightly on the back foot in front of a crowd of over 26,000 and were the first to concede when Charlton Athletic captain Johnnie Jackson curled a free-kick around the wall and into the net. That turned out to be the only goal of the game and Sheffield Wednesday were ended of their unbeaten run since the beginning of the season at home. Although with much of the season to go, the game was likely to end any chances of Sheffield Wednesday winning the league with Charlton Athletic now eight points clear of second place and Wednesday slipping down to fourth place with city rivals Sheffield United taking up second place four points ahead of The Owls, although they had played one extra game. The final of the four straight home games was against Hartlepool United and after a goalless first half it was Peter Hartley's goal that put Hartlepool United ahead two minutes into the second half. It took a goal by Jermaine Johnson when he took on four players on the right flank before finishing into the far, low bottom corner to put Sheffield Wednesday back on level terms. That goal lifted the fans in the stadium and the players reacted and scored a second with fifteen minutes to go with Gary Madine on the score sheet this time. However, again The Owls opted to start to defend their lead and then what seemed to be a goal out of nothing from outside the box and caught the keeper off his line, as Antony Sweeney's eighty-eighth minute effort meant Sheffield Wednesday could only manage a draw. With Wednesday reaching Round 3 of the FA Cup it meant that the game they would have played in the league on that same weekend was rescheduled to mid-week. This game was rescheduled to 24 January and was away to Scunthorpe United. After two disappointing results in a row Sheffield Wednesday were looking to bounce back. Sheffield Wednesday did exactly that when Chris O'Grady scored in under a minute after a long ball from Miguel Llera found the striker. Sheffield Wednesday then doubled their lead seventeen minutes later as Chris O'Grady grabbed his second. In the second half there was another goal from Jermaine Johnson, when he took on three players after running from the half-way line and slotted the ball coolly into the net when he found himself one-on-one. Jordan Robertson did pull one back for Scunthorpe United from a corner, but the game did finish 1\u20133 to The Owls. Sheffield Wednesday's next trip was in the FA Cup against Blackpool. Gary Megson made many changes to the side as he wanted to rest his key players ready for the tough mid-week tie in the league against fifth place MK Dons. One of those changes was striker Clinton Morrison who put The Owls unexpectedly ahead on the fifty-second minute. However, Sheffield Wednesday conceded yet another late, late goal, this time it was in the last minute of stoppage time again when Sheffield Wednesday conceded a penalty and Kevin Phillips scored from the spot in the ninety-minute, meaning a replay had to be played \u2013 something that neither team wanted due to their league focuses. The draw for the FA Cup saw the winner of the replay to play Premier League side Everton in the fifth round of the competition. After this Tottenham Hotspur young midfielder John Bostock join The Owls on loan until the end of the season. Mid-week and the last day of the month saw Sheffield Wednesday away to fifth place Milton Keynes Dons. Sheffield Wednesday were six points ahead of Milton Keynes Dons in fourth place; however they had played one more game than Milton Keynes Dons. An effort from distance saw the ball hit the bar and then hit goalkeeper Stephen Bywater's leg and roll into the net, giving Milton Keynes Dons the lead after seventeen minutes. Ten minutes later however a corner for Sheffield Wednesday saw Gary MacKenzie put the ball into his own net after the ball bounced off his knee, making it two own goals in the game. The game finished 1\u20131 and as a result Sheffield Wednesday went home happy with. However, the bad news of the month was Sheffield Wednesday were unable to extend key player Ben Marshall's loan until the end of the season. Marshall had made twenty-two appearances for the club, scoring five goals, and was signed by Football League Championship club Leicester City for over a million pounds. The loss of Marshall could have affected the team coming up to the 'business' and most crucial part of the season, and with Sheffield Wednesday only winning one of their last four gains with Ben Marshall, how much of an effect would his loss have on Sheffield Wednesday's automatic promotion hopes?", "|16 ||MF || ||16 ||Mike Jones || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "| Mike Jones"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["On 14 July the senior team played their first friendly away at AFC Wimbledon in a game they won 7\u20130.

Michail Antonio scored five minutes into the second half, before a 15-minute hat-trick for Simon Church and a goal from Jordan Obita completed the scoring. Stuart Taylor came on for the last 30 minutes, replacing Alex McCarthy, as he continued his trial with the club. Reading then flew out to Portugal to play three friendlies, the first of which took place on 21 July against Portuguese third division side Quarteirense in Quarteira. The match finished 1\u20131 with a trademark Ian Harte free kick only enough for draw. Three days later they lost 0\u20132 to Sheffield Wednesday, the goals coming from Mike Jones and Chris O'Grady either side of half time. Reading's final game in Portugal was played on 27 July against first division side Olhanense.

Pe\u010dnik is a winger who had played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup two-years previously. However, it was disappointing to hear that earlier that same day Sheffield Wednesday Academy manager Sean McAuley had left the club having been with the Owls since 2005. McAuley had gone over to America to become assistant manager at Major League Soccer club Portland Timbers. With a number of midfielder's in the Sheffield Wednesday squad Dave Jones decided to off-load promising youngster Liam Palmer on-loan to League One club Tranmere Rovers for a total of six-months. Palmer, a product of the Sheffield Wednesday Academy and a Scotland U-21 international, has scored one goal for the Owls and was a consistent starter at the early parts of the 2011\u201312 football league season. Wednesday played their first pre-season friendlies both at the same time, with manager Dave Jones sending out two different squads to the grounds of Sheffield F.C. and Stocksbridge Park Steels. A single goal by Chris O'Grady against Sheffield F.C. was not enough to earn a win and the game finished rightly as a draw, while a slightly stronger side beat Stocksbridge Park Steels 0\u20134. Two goals from Chris Maguire and one from Gary Madine and young trialist Patrick Antelmi saw the Owls get off to a good start in preparation to the pre-season tour in Portugal where the squad were due to fly to the next day. Sheffield Wednesday played their first game of two in Portugal after nearly a week of training their. The Owls went down 2\u20130 to a strong Sporting Lisbon side. Goals in either half saw off the Owls and was overall seen as a good workout in their preparation to the new season. Two days after this, Sheffield Wednesday were back at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira to play Premier League side Reading, who had just been promoted from the Football League Championship. A goal either side of half-time from Mike Jones and Chris O'Grady saw Wednesday go out deserved 2\u20130 winners. After the win, the Owls came back to their training base in Sheffield. On 28 July 2012, Wednesday played their first game since getting back to England, a friendly against Doncaster Rovers, and with little chances from both teams the game finished a goalless draw. Back to the transfer market and the Owls revealed the new signing of Rhys McCabe on a free transfer after deciding not to join the new-co Rangers. The young attacking midfielder agreed a three-year deal with the club. However, the signing was over-shadowed by the leaving of club captain and fan favourite Rob Jones, who left via mutual consent and went on to join Doncaster Rovers just the very next day.", "On the day of the last game of the month, against Fulham in the second round of the League Cup, Wednesday confirmed that midfielder David Prutton had joined Scunthorpe United on a three-month loan deal. Also, it was announced that Jermaine Johnson and Miguel Llera had been included in the Football League Championship Team of the Week. Later that same day it was confirmed that Diogo Amado had left the club to join Estoril Praia on an undisclosed fee. Amado had been unable to settle at the club after being there just a month having joined earlier on in the summer. Amado did not make a competitive appearance for the Owls, but played a healthy part in pre-season. The end of a busy Tuesday saw Sheffield Wednesday face Premier League Fulham in the League Cup second round. After an even first half, the Owls came out the better in the opening stages of the second half, and were rewarded after Chris Maguire was fouled inside the box and Gary Madine converted the penalty. Nejc Pe\u010dnik later hit the bar, but the game finished 1\u20130, with Wednesday going into the Third Round. The end of August every year always sees the end of the summer transfer window. Wednesday were looking to capture at least another three or four more players before the window shuts on 31 August at 23:00 (BST). The Owls did sign another with two-days to go before the transfer window shuts, as young midfielder Paul Corry joined the club on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee from University College Dublin. The Owls found out who they would meet in Round 3 of the League Cup on 30 August, and they saw themselves drawn away to Premier League new-boys Southampton. The last day of August saw one of the most exciting days of the football calendar \u2013 transfer deadline day. Dave Jones commented in hoping to bring in at least two players, while also expecting departures from the club. At 16:19 (BST), the Owls confirmed that midfielder Mike Jones had joined League One side Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee. Jones joined Wednesday just over six-months previously while Gary Megson was still manager. Under an hour later it was confirmed that Giles Coke, who had played in the mid-week League Cup win against Fulham, had joined Swindon Town on loan for six-months. Finally, with just over four-hours to go until the transfer window shuts Wednesday did confirm a capture, however only on a six-month loan deal. Queens Park Rangers forward Jay Bothroyd had joined the club having in the past worked with manager Dave Jones at Cardiff City. With eight-minutes to go until the transfer window shuts Sheffield Wednesday confirmed the signing of central defender Martin Taylor from Watford.
