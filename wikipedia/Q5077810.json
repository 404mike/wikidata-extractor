He was a significant champion of the Scottish Gaelic language in Victorian Britain.\nFraser-Mackintosh was the son of Alexander Fraser, of Dochnalurg, Inverness, and his wife Marjory Mackintosh. He assumed the additional surname of Mackintosh by royal licence 1857.  He trained as a lawyer and became a councillor in Inverness. He was heavily involved in land and development in the town and was chairman of the Anglo-American Land Mortgage and Agency Co. Using money he made from the construction of Union Street, he bought and laid out the Drummond estate (1863), which had previously belonged to Fraser-Mackintosh's great-great uncle Provost Phineas Mackintosh and Ballifeary estates (1860s).  Fraser-Mackintosh was also a captain in the Inverness-shire Rifle Volunteers from 1860 and a J.P. for Inverness-shire.As a lawyer, he had access to many rare manuscripts and documents, and these formed the basis for his own published works on Scottish history. In his historical work, Fraser-Mackintosh admitted to a sympathy for the Jacobite cause of \"Bonnie Prince Charlie,\" due to being indirectly named after the prince via various Jacobite ancestors. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. In 1875, he was Chief of the Gaelic Society of Inverness. He was the third President of An Comunn Gaidhealach, the national Gaelic Society, serving from 1896 to 1898.It is thought that Fraser-Mackintosh rendered legal assistance to Mairi Mh\u00f2r nan Oran when she was accused of theft from her employer in 1872. He appears to have recruited to her cause by John Murdoch and to have earned her enduring gratitude and affection. He is one of the land rights campaigners mentioned in her celebrated poem Nuair a chaidh na ceithir \u00f9r oirre.\nFraser-Mackintosh was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Inverness Burghs in 1874 and held the seat until the 1885 general election. Initially he was opposed to agrarian unrest, arguing that negative consequences would occur if Scottish Gaels adopted the tactics of the Irish Land League and came to be seen as \"discontented and disaffected.\" Later he changed his mind and was returned as the MP for Inverness-shire for the Crofter's Party in 1885. He was returned unopposed in 1886, but opposing home rule for Ireland, he joined the Liberal Unionist Party, and lost the support of the local Highland Land League. The League backed Liberal Party candidate Donald MacGregor at the 1892 election, who unseated Fraser-Mackintosh. He was then the only Gaelic-speaking member of the Commons and became known as the 'Member for the Highlands'. One of five members of the Napier Commission, set up in 1883, to investigate the crofters' situation; he was the driving force behind the establishment of the Crofters' Commission and for promoting the use of Gaelic in Highland schools. His efforts led to the establishment of  a Free Library in Inverness in 1883.Fraser-Mackintosh died at the age of 72.\nFraser-Mackintosh married Eveline May Holland of Brooklands, Streatham in 1876. His widow left his personal library of over 5000 books and journals to Inverness Burgh library in 1921.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Macpherson", "response": ["In his later years he bought an estate, to which he gave the name Belville or Balavil, in his native Inverness-shire, where he died at the age of 59. Macpherson's remains were carried from Scotland and interred in the Abbey Church of Westminster. The Highland MP and antiquarian, Charles Fraser-Mackintosh, appears to comment enviously on the success of James Macpherson in his second series of Antiquarian Notes (Inverness 1897, pp 369 et seq, public domain):Mr James Macpherson of Ossianic fame, who acquired Phoiness, Etterish, and Invernahaven, began this wretched business and did it so thoroughly that not much remained for his successors ... Every place James Macpherson acquired was cleared, and he also had a craze for changing and obliterating the old names ... [including] ... Raitts into Belville. Upon this point it may be noticed that Mac Ossian, in making an entail and calling four of his numerous bastards [this comment has no support] in the first instance to the succession, declares an irritancy if any of the heirs uses any other designation than that of Macpherson of Belville.After calling Macpherson's children bastards, Fraser-Mackintosh asserts that Macpherson bought the right to be buried in Westminster Abbey. If it was for sale, why not? A recent commentator suggests Macpherson has become known as \"a descendent of a Jacobite clan who became a sycophantic Hanovarian toady, a man for the main chance\"."]}, {"page": "Highland Land League", "response": ["The earlier protests had been largely confined to Skye.

It is often claimed that another servant with a grudge against her planted the stolen clothes in Mairi Mh\u00f2r's box.  She protested her innocence for the rest of her life and was almost universally believed by the Gaelic speaking community. At the time of her trial she was supported by John Murdoch, campaigning journalist and founder of The Highlander.

On one side were the confederation of Clan Chattan and on the other side was the Clan Cameron. Thirty warriors were selected to represent each side, but one of the Chattan men fell sick prior to the commencement of the battle and it was therefore proposed that the Camerons should lose one man to keep the numbers even on each side. However, a local man from Perth named either Henry Wynd or Henry Smith who was either a smith or armourer, by trade volunteered to take the sick man's place on the condition that he would be paid a fee if he survived. According to John Scott Keltie, Henry was known as Gow Crom which is Scottish Gaelic for \"Crooked Smith\". Only one man of the Clan Cameron and eleven men of the Clan Chattan survived the battle, including Henry Wynd or Smith. Historian Charles Fraser-Mackintosh stated that Henry, who was a swordsman, had contributed greatly to the success of his side during the battle. Keltie stated that Henry was the only one of the survivors on the Chattan side who was not wounded and that by his excellence as a swordsman had mainly contributed to gain the day. After the battle Henry Smith was invited north, and adopted into the Clan Chattan where he became the progenitor of the family known in Scottish Gaelic as Sliochd an Gobh Cruim which means \"the race of the crooked smith\", according to Alexander Mackintosh-Shaw. According to Charles Fraser-Mackintosh, they are known as Sliochd a Ghobha Chrom and that Henry had twelve followers who to keep in his favor learned to make swords and how to use them. They spread out over the country and in time took the surname of Mackintosh who was their chief. Fraser-Mackintosh states that the Gows took protection of Mackintosh (who was the chief of Clan Chattan) in 1399. However, the modern publication Scots Kith & Kin (2014) states that the Gows were a sept of the Clan Macpherson who are also part of the Clan Chattan."]}]}}
