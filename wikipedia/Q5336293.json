Eddie McCloskey and Brendan McCarry fired over points, and they could have had more but for some solid defending from Joe Brady. Coolderry's Cathal Parlon and Brian Carroll brought the Leinster champions level, but a second Loughgiel goal from Liam Watson in the 18th minute gave the Antrim side a massive lift. Two more goals in as many minutes from Watson secured the hat-trick and left Coolderry with a 10-point deficit."]}]}}
