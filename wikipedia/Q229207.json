The producers found Judge the easiest to cast due to his muscular presence. Shanks was cast because he did \"the perfect imitation of James Spader\", according to Wright. The producers knew Don S.

The producers had met him during sci-fi conventions and had previously discussed casting him in other Stargate roles. The producers approached Emmy Award-winning actor Beau Bridges directly to play the role of Hank Landry.

While news outlets cited declining ratings, expensive production and lack of promotion as possible reasons for the cancellation, the Sci Fi Channel's Mark Stern merely stated the decision was not ratings-based. Instead, he said the production staff was given enough time to tie up all the loose ends of the story and SG-1 cast members were planned to be incorporated into the renewed Stargate Atlantis. Meanwhile, the SG-1 producers and rights-holder MGM expressed a desire to continue SG-1 as a movie, mini-series, or an eleventh season on another network.

The first film, Stargate: The Ark of Truth, was released in March 2008 and wraps up the Ori storyline.

Martin Wood would serve as director. The premise of the film would have been the \"possibility of the Stargate program going public\".

Wright and Joe Mallozzi expressed optimism that production would eventually start, until Wright announced in April 2011 that the SG-1 film project was permanently shelved, along with plans for future Atlantis and Stargate Universe films and a cross-over film incorporating elements from all three series.

The reviewer considered the visual effects to be especially impressive and considered Amanda Tapping's performance in the final scene to be \"particularly heart-rending, poignant to say the least\".", "\"Lost City\" was presented as a single 1 hour 22 minute feature for the DVD release.
