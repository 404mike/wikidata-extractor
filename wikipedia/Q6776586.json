As Norman Naimark writes, these concepts are different but related, for \"literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people\". William Schabas adds, \"Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come. Genocide is the last resort of the frustrated ethnic cleanser.\" Sociologist Martin Shaw has criticized distinguishing between ethnic cleansing and genocide as both ultimately result in the destruction of a group though coercive violence.Shaw, Martin (2015b), What is Genocide, Polity Press, ISBN 978-0-7456-8706-3 \u2018Cleansing\u2019 and genocide.

Martin Shaw described these atrocities as \"the purest genocide of the Cold War era.\" Backed by the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation, an organization of Khmer pro-Soviet Communists and Khmer Rouge defectors led by Heng Samrin, Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978. The invasion succeeded in deposing Pol Pot, but the new state would struggle to gain international recognition beyond the Soviet Bloc sphere. Despite the previous international outcry at the Pol Pot regime's gross human rights violations, representatives of the Khmer Rouge were allowed to be seated in the UN General Assembly, with strong support from China, Western powers, and the member countries of ASEAN. Cambodia would become bogged down in a guerrilla war led from refugee camps located on the border with Thailand. Following the destruction of the Khmer Rouge, the national reconstruction of Cambodia would be severely hampered, and Vietnam would suffer a punitive Chinese attack."]}, {"page": "Edward S.

Taking an action with some other goal (e.g. exporting grain to import machinery) but which the actor certainly knows will also cause peasants to starve does not count as intentionally starving the peasants. However, this is an interpretation of 'intent' which flies in the face of the general legal interpretation.\" Sociologist Martin Shaw supports this view, as he posits that if a leader knew the ultimate result of their policies would be mass death by famine, and they continue to enact them anyway, these deaths can be understood as intentional even if that was not the sole intent of the policies. Wheatcroft, in turn, criticizes this view in regard to the Soviet famine because he believes that the high expectations of central planners was sufficient to demonstrate their ignorance of the ultimate consequences of their actions and that the result of them would be famine. Ellman states that Stalin clearly committed crimes against humanity but whether he committed genocide depends on genocide definitions, and many other events would also have to be considered genocides. Additionally, Ellman is critical of the fixation on a \"uniquely Stalinist evil\" when it comes to excess deaths from famines, and argues that famines and droughts have been a common occurrence throughout Russian history, including the Russian famine of 1921\u20131922, which occurred before Stalin came to power. He also states that famines were widespread throughout the world in the 19th and 20th centuries in countries such as China, India, Ireland, and Russia. According to Ellman, the G8 \"are guilty of mass manslaughter or mass deaths from criminal negligence because of their not taking obvious measures to reduce mass deaths\", and Stalin's \"behaviour was no worse than that of many rulers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\""]}, {"page": "New wars", "response": ["Other authors also attempted to characterize the shift in warfare but using other descriptors.

Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because class enemies, foreign spies and saboteurs, or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that the vision itself might be unworkable, because that meant capitulation to the forces of reaction.\" Michael Mann writes that communist party members were \"ideologically driven, believing that in order to create a new socialist society, they must lead in socialist zeal. Killings were often popular, the rank-and-file as keen to exceed killing quotas as production quotas.\" According to Vladimir Tism\u0103neanu, \"the Communist project, in such countries as the USSR, China, Cuba, Romania, or Albania, was based precisely on the conviction that certain social groups were irretrievably alien and deservedly murdered.\" Alex Bellamy writes that \"communism's ideology of selective extermination\" of target groups was first developed and applied by Joseph Stalin but that \"each of the communist regimes that massacred large numbers of civilians during the Cold War developed their own distinctive account\", while Steven T. Katz states that distinctions based on class and nationality, stigmatized and stereotyped in various ways, created an \"otherness\" for victims of communist rule that was important for legitimating oppression and death. Martin Shaw writes that \"nationalist ideas were at the heart of many mass killings by Communist states\", beginning with Stalin's \"new nationalist doctrine of 'socialism in one country'\", and killing by revolutionary movements in the Third World was done in the name of national liberation.", "The Killing Fields are a number of sites in Cambodia where large numbers of people were killed and their bodies were buried by the Khmer Rouge regime during its rule of the country, which lasted from 1975 to 1979, after the end of the Cambodian Civil War. Sociologist Martin Shaw described the Cambodian genocide as \"the purest genocide of the Cold War era.\" The results of a demographic study of the Cambodian genocide concluded that the nationwide death toll from 1975 to 1979 amounted to 1,671,000 to 1,871,000, or 21 to 24 percent of the total Cambodian population as it was estimated to number before the Khmer Rouge took power. According to Ben Kiernan, the number of deaths which were specifically caused by execution is still unknown because many victims died from starvation, disease and overwork. Researcher Craig Etcheson of the Documentation Center of Cambodia suggests that the death toll was between 2 and 2.5 million, with a \"most likely\" figure of 2.2 million. After spending five years researching about 20,000 grave sites, he posited that \"these mass graves contain the remains of 1,112,829 victims of execution.\" A study by French demographer Marek Sliwinski calculated slightly fewer than 2 million unnatural deaths under the Khmer Rouge out of a 1975 Cambodian population of 7.8 million, with 33.5% of Cambodian men dying under the Khmer Rouge compared to 15.7% of Cambodian women. The number of suspected victims of execution who were found in 23,745 mass graves is estimated to be 1.3 million according to a 2009 academic source. Execution is believed to account for roughly 60% of the total death toll during the genocide, with other victims succumbing to starvation or disease.", "Benjamin Valentino writes: \"Although not all the deaths due to famine in these cases were intentional, communist leaders directed the worst effects of famine against their suspected enemies and used hunger as a weapon to force millions of people to conform to the directives of the state.\" Daniel Goldhagen says that in some cases deaths from famine should not be distinguished from mass murder, commenting: \"Whenever governments have not alleviated famine conditions, political leaders decided not to say no to mass death \u2013 in other words, they said yes.\" Goldhagen says that instances of this occurred in the Mau Mau Rebellion, the Great Leap Forward, the Nigerian Civil War, the Eritrean War of Independence, and the War in Darfur. Martin Shaw posits that if a leader knew the ultimate result of their policies would be mass death by famine, and they continue to enact them anyway, these deaths can be understood as intentional."]}, {"page": "Roy Shaw (arts administrator)", "response": ["While at Manchester University he was an editor of the short-lived journal, Humanitas, along with Herbert McCabe, who later became a Dominican priest.
