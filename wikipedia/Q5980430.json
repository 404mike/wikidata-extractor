In their history of the Scottish Cup, David Potter and Phil H. Jones claim that \"the first ninety minutes of the game was, in the opinion of most people, a dreadful game of football\" and note that even the commentators on the television coverage of the match struggled \"to keep their audience involved\". The main action came in extra time. During this period Iain Ferguson seemed to have opened the scoring for Dundee United, but the goal was disallowed as the referee controversially ruled Kevin Gallacher to be in an offside position.

Motherwell began to settle, however, before the game then went in to something of a lull.
