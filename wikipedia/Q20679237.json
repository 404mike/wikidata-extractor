In 1960 Dobson began working as a lecturer in archaeology in the Department of Extra Mural Studies, teaching in the adult education department - a post in which he remained until retirement in 1990. In this capacity Dobson organized a series of tours of Hadrian's Wall sites every four years in the 1960s. During these he introduced his students (and others) to many little-known (to the amateur) sites on the wall. He worked closely with David Breeze (chief inspector of ancient monuments for historic Scotland and visiting professor at Durham University since 1994) on their joint studies in aspects of Hadrian's Wall and produced one of the most influential texts on the subject, still in print today. He undertook a series of excavations in Corbridge in the 1960s and 1970s, and provided an eyewitness account of the discovery of the Corbridge Hoard.Allason-Jones, L., Bishop, M.

Marcius Dioga\", Cahiers du Centre Gustave Glotz, 2 (1991), pp. 165-188 The earliest appointment known for Dioga was as military tribune assigned to Legio XII Fulminata, stationed at Melitene in Cappadocia; he could have served during the reign of Commodus This was undoubtedly the second step in the tres militiae that equestrians with military commissions advanced through. The first, commander of a cohors of 500 men was described on a lost line on the two inscriptions. The next known appointment was his commission as praefectus of the Classis Pannonica, a fleet of river boats that patrolled the Danube above the Iron Gates, whose headquarters is believed to be at Taurunum.Graham Webster, The Roman Imperial Army (New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1969), p. 161 There is no mention of Dioga commanding a cavalry ala, the expected third step of the tres militiae; Sablayrolles speculates that the line listing this may have been lost from both inscriptions.Sablayrolles, Libertinus miles, p. 502 Or command of the Classis Pannonica may have served as the final step of his tres militiae. Nevertheless, this was Dioga's last military commission."]}]}}
