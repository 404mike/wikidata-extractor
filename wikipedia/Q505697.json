Most notably, he is known for serving as the director of the East India Company. Due to his strong belief in the state and his prior experience as a merchant, Mun took on a prominent role during the economic depression which began in 1620.  To defend the East India Company and to regain England's economic stability, Mun published A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East-Indies.\nThrough mercantilist principles, Mun created a proposed set of \"means to enrich a kingdom\" which centred on ensuring that exports exceeded imports.  In other words, Mun advocated for achieving a positive balance of trade which would cause England's wealth to steadily increase.  Thomas Mun is also widely considered to be a sophisticated thinker and has become a hugely important part of the history of economic theory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Balance of trade", "response": ["An early statement concerning the balance of trade appeared in Discourse of the Common Wealth of this Realm of England, 1549: \"We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.\"Now attributed to Sir Thomas Smith; quoted in Jos\u00e9 Rizal, The Wheels of Commerce, vol.

In 1891, Alfred Waterhouse built another Weigh House church, on Duke Street. The building was deemed so magnificent that nearby Robert Street was renamed Weighhouse Street in its honour.
