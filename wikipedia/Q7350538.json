The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with the outbreak of the First World War, which prevented construction of further class members. Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway\u2019s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR's passenger locomotive fleet.Swift, p. 9 His response was to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.Bradley (1987), p. 41"]}, {"page": "Eastleigh Works", "response": ["Among the locomotives produced by the LSWR under Drummond at Eastleigh, were the S14 0-4-0 and M7 0-4-4 tank engines, the P14 and T14 4-6-0, and D15 4-4-0, classes. Following the appointment of Robert Urie as Chief Mechanical Engineer in 1912, the works were responsible for the construction of the H15, S15, and N15 (King Arthur) 4-6-0 classes, and the G16 4-8-0, and H16 4-6-0 tank engines."]}, {"page": "Brighton railway works", "response": ["From 1905 Brighton works was unable to keep pace with the locomotives requiring to be serviced, and backlogs began to build up.

An outside investigation in 1908, conducted by Robert Urie, then Works Manager of Nine Elms Works found 108 of the LB&SCR's 541 locomotives (20%) were awaiting or under repair, and that a general overhaul at Brighton took 43 days, compared with 7.2% of the locomotives of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway under repair and 21 days taken by Ashford Works."]}, {"page": "LSWR M7 class", "response": ["Following the successful use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally fitted a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, together with an extended smokebox and larger cylinders.

As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally fitted with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic Warning System, but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed."]}, {"page": "LSWR B4 class", "response": ["Drummond designed a similar class of five locomotives in 1907, with a slightly smaller boiler and lipped chimney.

As the LSWR lacked existing freight designs capable of undertaking this task, a new design was needed to serve the south coast ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton. The design was also to power traffic including milk trains, which required fast transit to the dairies in London.Russell (1991). p. 257. Robert Urie used this opportunity to develop his recent H15 class design further, applying the 4-6-0 locomotive concept to a purpose-built freight design built to order number S15. It was this order number that gave the class the name \"S15\".Clarke (April 2008). p. 48.", "This was the third design by Robert Urie for the LSWR. The outline was made during the First World War, and incorporated lessons learned from the operation of his H15 class, a design that was to provide the basis for future standardisation on the LSWR.Bradley (1987). Section \"S15 class\". To economise on maintenance, the S15 class had interchangeable components that could be used on a similar design, the N15 class passenger locomotive, which had the same overall appearance. Details such as the boiler, the two-cylinders and valve gear were standardised between the classes, although a taper boiler was used on the S15 and N15 classes, as opposed to the parallel boiler of the H15 class.Clarke (April 2008). p. 49. The only other major difference was the smaller diameter of the driving wheels.Russell (1991). pp. 257\u2013260. Smaller diameter wheels gave better traction, essential for a fast freight locomotive."]}, {"page": "LSWR L11 class", "response": ["The L11 class was one of a number of designs by Dugald Drummond incorporating a large proportion of standard parts that could be interchanged with other classes of locomotive.
