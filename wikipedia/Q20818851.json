Disaster was prevented by mere minutes. When the IRA announced its cease-fire that same year, Joe Little was in the Belfast studio beginning an interview with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when the sound broke down live on air on a temporary basis. During one edition, the entire programme did malfunction, and, with interviews suspended and a commercial break impossible, Hanly intervened to prevent a complete disaster for several minutes by commenting to the show's previous guest: \"There was one other question I wanted to ask you [...]\". Joe Little interviewed Lady Valerie Goulding to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of The Blitz of London by Germany."]}, {"page": "Joseph Little", "response": ["* Joe Little (1902\u20131965), English football outside left for Plymouth Argyle, Darlington, Bradford Park Avenue and Rotherham United"]}, {"page": "List of aviators by nickname", "response": ["* \"Lightning\" \u2013 Joe Little, African American WW2 pilot (member of the Tuskegee Airmen)"]}, {"page": "1978 Florida state elections", "response": ["*Joe Little - 103,275 (11.7%)"]}, {"page": "Walter Cook (footballer)", "response": ["Cook played for Leeds City immediately after the First World War, but had left the club for Midland League club Castleford Town of the Midland League before the Football League resumed.
