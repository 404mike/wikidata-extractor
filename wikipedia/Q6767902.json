The bitch, Eve, bought by George at Leadenhall Market, was old enough to be grey-muzzled, but of good type. The dog, Adam, was of reputed Lyme Hall origin, but bought at Tattersalls and suspected by Garnier of containing a \"dash of Boarhound\", an ancestral form of Great Dane. Garnier took them with him when he was posted to Canada and brought back their puppy, Lion. He was bred to Lukey's Countess to produce Governor, the source of all existing male Mastiff lines (Lion was also mated to Lufra, a Scottish Deerhound, and their puppy Marquis appears in the pedigrees of both Deerhounds and Irish Wolfhounds).thumb|left|Lukey's Governor, born 1861, a six generation ancestor of Ch. Crown Princethumb|left|The controversial Ch. Crown Prince, pictured in old age In the 1880s soundness was sacrificed for type, which was widely attributed to the short-headed, massive, but straight-stifled and chocolate-masked Ch. Crown Prince. This dog dominated all of his contemporaries in terms of the number of offspring. Subsequently, the Mastiff lost popularity but gained a consistency of type, with leaner, longer-headed specimens becoming relatively less common. Prominent among the breeders of this era who began to restore soundness were Edgar Hanbury and his relation, the politician and philanthropist Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, later Chairman of The Kennel Club, who reaching his peak as a breeder with the Crown Prince grandson, Ch. Beaufort, eventually exported to America."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Mark Hanbury Beaufoy"]}, {"page": "Kennington (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Mark Hanbury Beaufoy"]}, {"page": "High Sheriff of Wiltshire", "response": ["*1900: Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, of Coombe House, Shaftesbury"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Mark Hanbury Beaufoy"]}, {"page": "Mark Beaufoy", "response": ["His grandson, Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, was an English vinegar manufacturer and politician.
