Some of his key roles were the Counsel in Trial by Jury, Strephon in Iolanthe, Pish-Tush in The Mikado, Giuseppe in The Gondoliers, Mr. Cox in Cox and Box, Grosvenor in Patience and the Lieutenant of the Tower in The Yeomen of the Guard. He recorded most of these roles with the company. Styler was particularly popular with both audiences and his fellow members of D'Oyly Carte.
