Torgersen.Work outside the Freehold universe includes The Hero (2004), written with John Ringo, and the time travel story A Long Time Until Now (2014). Short fiction by Williamson includes the story \"Soft Casualty\", an exploration of psychological warfare which won a readers' choice award organized by Baen Books.

Kratman's first novel, A State of Disobedience (2003), deals with a revolution against tyranny in a future United States. The book was described by Lesley Farmer in Kliatt as a \"libertarian-inspired combat story\" with shallow characterization. Another politically-oriented stand-alone novel, Caliphate (2008), takes place in a future Islamic Europe where a German girl is sold into prostitution to pay her family's yizya. The work has been described as a part of a trend towards more speculative fiction focus on Islam after the September 11 attacks and as driving \"some readers to apoplexy\". Mark Steyn discussed the novel's political aspects at length and also described it as \"a brisk page-turner full of startling twists and bad sex\".", "Short fiction by Kratman includes a contribution to the Forged in Blood (2017) anthology, which takes place in the Freehold universe created by Michael Z.
