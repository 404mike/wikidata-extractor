Stonehouse is remembered for his unsuccessful attempt at faking his own death in 1974, a scheme uncovered after a claim that Stonehouse was recently-disappeared murder suspect Lord Lucan.\nMore than twenty years after his death, it was publicly revealed that he had been an agent for the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic military intelligence. In 1979, the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, and top cabinet members learned from a Czech defector that Stonehouse had been a paid Czechoslovak spy since 1962. He had provided secrets about government plans as well as technical information about aircraft, and received about \u00a35,000. He was already in prison for fraud and the government decided there was insufficient evidence to bring him to trial, so no announcement or prosecution was made.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 7", "response": ["*1976 \u2013 Member of Parliament and suspected spy John Stonehouse resigns from the Labour Party after being arrested for faking his own death."]}, {"page": "List of political scandals in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Labour MP John Stonehouse's faked suicide (1974)"]}, {"page": "Privy Council of the United Kingdom", "response": ["Individuals can choose to resign, sometimes to avoid expulsion.
