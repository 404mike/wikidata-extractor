His most noted composition was the song Ave Maria with accompaniment by piano, and violin obbligato.\nKahn was born in London in 1880.  He was a boy soprano, and at the age of 15 won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, where he studied for four years under the organist and composer Walter Parratt. He also studied piano with Marmaduke Barton, and theory with Charles Wood and Walford Davies.\nKahn accompanied some of the great musicians of the day, including violinists Mischa Elman and Fritz Kreisler; sopranos Dame Nellie Melba, Luisa Tetrazzini, Florence Austral and Oda Slobodskaya, tenors Enrico Caruso, John McCormack, Richard Tauber, Vladimir Rosing, Joseph Hislop and Beniamino Gigli; and baritones Titta Ruffo and John Brownlee. Of all these artists, he was most closely associated with Richard Tauber, whom he accompanied regularly for 14 years, from 1933 up until Tauber's death.Tauber recorded four of his songs for Parlophone, and sang others in broadcasts.\nHis Ave Maria was recorded in 1913 by Enrico Caruso and Mischa Elman, with the composer at the piano.Percy Kahn was married to the contralto Olive Kavann, with whom he also recorded.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amy Woodforde-Finden", "response": ["Kashmiri Song and, to a lesser extent, Till I wake were frequently recorded, including by tenor Richard Tauber with Percy Kahn at the piano. Two complete sets of the Four Indian Love Lyrics were made by the English tenor Frank Titterton; and three by the Australian bass-baritone Peter Dawson, in 1923, 1925 and 1932."]}, {"page": "Richard Tauber", "response": ["Tauber made over 720 vocal recordings for the Odeon/Parlophone companies, plus several as an orchestral conductor, mainly of his own works, but also of music by Grieg and Johann Strauss, Jr. Of the 120 acoustic recordings, the most important are of arias by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Kienzl, and songs by Schumann, Richard Strauss and Grieg. There are also five duets with Elisabeth Rethberg, arias by Verdi, Puccini etc., and excerpts from Korngold's Die tote Stadt, including a duet with Lotte Lehmann. Among the electrical recordings, there are albums of German folksongs, and 12 songs from Schubert's Winterreise, accompanied by Mischa Spoliansky, and an album of folksongs by Franz Gabriel and Hermann L\u00f6ns. Perhaps most prized are the four Mozart arias recorded in 1938 and 1939, and the aria from Der Freisch\u00fctz made in 1946. Among his last recordings are two songs by Richard Strauss, accompanied at the piano by Percy Kahn. In his lifetime, his many recordings of music by Franz Leh\u00e1r, much of it written for him, and his own songs from the operetta Old Chelsea (1942) were best sellers, along with a huge range of lighter and popular music in German and English. A number of his broadcasts have been preserved, including a series of General Motors Concerts from America in 1937, a Radio Hilversum concert of 1939, and excerpts from his three series of weekly programmes for the BBC (1945\u201347)."]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists", "response": ["* Percy Kahn"]}, {"page": "Enrico Caruso compact disc discography", "response": ["# Ave Maria (Percy Kahn) File:Caruso-AveMaria.ogg", "# \"Ave Maria\" (Percy Kahn) File:Caruso-AveMaria.ogg"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists (recorded)", "response": ["* Percy Kahn"]}, {"page": "List of Desert Island Discs episodes (1951\u20131960)", "response": ["|||Percy Kahn||No book||Tape recorder|| more"]}, {"page": "1966 in British music", "response": ["*2 May \u2013 Percy Kahn, pianist and composer, 85"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 1966", "response": ["* Percy Kahn, English pianist and composer (b. 1880)"]}]}}
