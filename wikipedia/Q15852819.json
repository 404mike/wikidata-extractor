In 1968, he played the lead role in a revival of D. H.

Old Lambert (John Barrett) is marked physically and mentally by his work at the coalface. ... All are excellently portrayed in this first-rate production.\" In 1970, Barrett played the lead role in Barry Hines's play Billy's Last Stand. One reviewer wrote, \"Both John Barrett as Billy and Ian McKellen as Darkly give powerful performances, each sombre, thoughtful, balanced and real, though, by the end, the melodrama seems even to have seeped through to their performances.\" Another said, \"The acting is first-rate. ... John Barrett is wonderfully solid and self-satisfied at the start as an innocent faced by capitalism; and in his final gritty resignation to his fate the actor never puts an eyelid wrong.\""]}, {"page": "The Daughter-in-Law", "response": ["The play premiered on 16 March 1967 at the Royal Court Theatre, London, directed by Peter Gill.
