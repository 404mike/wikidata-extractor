The Silk Dressing Room contains a large tin bath on castors.  The other bedrooms are the Chintz Bedroom, which is furnished as a sitting room, the Lemon Bedroom, and the Amber Bedroom, which is furnished as a Victorian day nursery.  Most of the paintings in the bedrooms depict family members.  The Egerton Room was originally the Blue Bedroom but, with its dressing room, is now used for an exhibition about the Egerton family.  In addition to family portraits, the paintings in these rooms include schemes for the design of the house by the architects, and paintings of architectural features by J. C. Buckler.  There are also three paintings of excavations for the Manchester Ship Canal by Benjamin Williams Leader.
