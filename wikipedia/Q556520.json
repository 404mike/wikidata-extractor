As a young man, it enabled him to be employed as a mechanical draughtsman at the Portland Locomotive Company and later preparing wood engravings for natural history publications. This relatively well-paid work enabled him to save enough money to support his further education. Morse was recommended by Philip Pearsall Carpenter to Louis Agassiz (1807\u20131873) at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University for his intellectual qualities and talent at drawing. After completing his studies he served as Agassiz's assistant in charge of conservation, documentation and drawing collections of mollusks and brachiopods until 1862. He became especially interested in brachiopods during this time, and his first paper on the topic was published in 1862."]}, {"page": "Lant Carpenter", "response": ["#Philip Pearsall Carpenter was born on 4 November 1819 in Bristol, Somerset, England.
