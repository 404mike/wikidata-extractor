A left-arm fast-medium pace bowler, he appeared for England in two Test matches in 1889.\nFothergill began his career as a club professional in the north east of England. He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was the most productive bowler for the county in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides.\nIn the English winter of 1888\u201389, he was chosen to tour South Africa with the MCC, and played in two matches which were later designated as Test matches, though Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described them as being \"arguably not even first-class.\" He took 119 first-class wickets during his career, of which eight came in his two Tests.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Montague Druitt", "response": ["On 26 May 1884, Druitt was elected to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) on the recommendation of his fellow Butterflies player Charles Seymour, who proposed him, and noted fielder Vernon Royle, who seconded his nomination.Leighton, p. 38 One of the minor matches he played for MCC was with England bowler William Attewell against Harrow School on 10 June 1886. The MCC won by 57 runs.Leighton, pp. 61, 183 Druitt also played against MCC for Blackheath: on 23 July 1887, he bowled out Dick Pougher for 28 runs, but he only made 5 runs before bowled out by Arnold Fothergill with a ball caught by Pougher.

His first match for the county was against the MCC in late July. He appeared six further times in 1883, against county opposition, and in all matches that season, collected 52 first-class wickets at an average of 30.20. In 1883, he also made his highest first-class score, making 47 runs during Somerset's second innings against Hampshire. He came into bat with the score at 86 runs for the loss of seven wickets, and was the last wicket to fall, by which time Somerset had moved to 181, and Bastard had shared a tenth wicket partnership of 74 with Arnold Fothergill.

He performed better with the ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against both Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54\u00a0runs in the second innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51\u00a0runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85\u00a0runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, this time with the bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores in the twenties by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings.", "Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.Foot (1986), pp. 23\u201328. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton, during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy.Roebuck (1991), pp. 30\u201332. In Somerset's first match of 1886, Sainsbury hit his highest score for the county in almost three years, scoring 90 out of a Somerset total of 241. The bowling of Arnold Fothergill helped to restrict their opponents, Warwickshire, in the second innings; but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory, Somerset were bowled out for 58. Throughout 1886, Sainsbury's batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in the previous two years of first-class cricket, and he regularly made scores in the twenties and thirties. He hit 94 from the middle order against the MCC in mid-August, his highest score of the season. Toward the end of the 1886 season the arrival of Sammy Woods and George Nichols vastly improved the quality of the bowling for the county, but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start.Roebuck (1991), pp. 36\u201343. A victory over Essex, in which Sainsbury scored 71, was bracketed by heavy losses to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire. Against Hampshire, Sainsbury reached his highest total for Somerset, scoring 164 out of a total of 315, to help his side on their way to a six-wicket victory. A big win over Warwickshire followed, and the county was said to be \"a ship heading out for an ocean of prosperity\".Roebuck (1991), p. 43."]}, {"page": "Robert Warton (umpire)", "response": ["In the 1st Test, South Africa won the toss and batted first, but were bowled out for 84, with Johnny Briggs taking 4/39 and England captain Sir Aubrey Smith taking 5/19.

Besides Grace himself, other noted players in the USEE team were Fred Grace, Billy Midwinter, Henry Charlwood and James Southerton. Grace took 20 wickets in the match and, batting at number six (he was habitually an opening batsman despite his status as an all-rounder), scored 22 and 73. The USEE won by 193 runs. The railways served Grace well in July and he was immediately away north to Newcastle upon Tyne for the next engagement against Eighteen of Newcastle upon Tyne, starting on Monday 15 July. The Newcastle team included Dick Barlow, Alex Watson and Arnold Fothergill so Grace may have bitten off more than he could chew. Fothergill dismissed him for 5 in the first innings after Newcastle had made a sizeable 251 (Barlow 42). The USEE were humiliatingly bowled out for 66 and had to follow on.
