A left-arm fast-medium pace bowler, he appeared for England in two Test matches in 1889.\nFothergill began his career as a club professional in the north east of England. He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was the most productive bowler for the county in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides.\nIn the English winter of 1888\u201389, he was chosen to tour South Africa with the MCC, and played in two matches which were later designated as Test matches, though Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described them as being \"arguably not even first-class.\" He took 119 first-class wickets during his career, of which eight came in his two Tests.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
