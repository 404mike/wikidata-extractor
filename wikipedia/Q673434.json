This is the first legal abortion aired on American television since the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling. However, Maude Findlay had an abortion on Maude the year before, after New York legalized the practice. Erica was chosen for this storyline as a way to prevent controversy. Since she was a bad girl and not one of the heroines, her choice would not be viewed as something the show supported. The show also protected themselves from controversy by writing Erica as mentally blocking out the abortion and, for a time, believing she miscarried. Viewers loved the story and Erica became a symbol of free choice.Siegel, p. 58-9. Erica develops a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion. \"Erica's abortion was simply because she didn't want to have a child, and I think if you do that now, you would perhaps hurt your character,\" said former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish. McTavish later rewrote the story so the doctor, Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), transplants the aborted fetus into his infertile wife. They raise the child, Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), as their son without Erica's knowledge. Inkling Magazine pointed out how unrealistic this storyline was because \"the techniques by which abortion is performed don't exactly lend themselves to excising an embryo viable enough to survive in another woman's womb.\" The magazine said more likelihood existed in the possibility that Madden harvested Erica's eggs during the procedure, though an invasive surgery like that going unnoticed appeared unlikely as well. Egglesfield gained different information on the probability of the story. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he said, \"Actually, my father is an obstetrician/gynecologist and my brother is a doctor, as is one of my best friends, and their collective opinion is that this is possible; it is possible to take a fetus out of one woman and place it into the womb of another woman, but it's only possible within the first week of pregnancy, before the fetus actually starts attaching itself to the uterine lining.\" In the storyline, Greg harbors an obsession with Erica, which motivates him to choose her for the transplant in the first place. Greg and Josh make their first appearances in 2005. Greg's wife recently died and he moves to Pine Valley for closer proximity to Erica under the guise of opening a clinic. Josh follows him soon afterward and, not knowing Erica is his mother, attempts to destroy Erica in order to steal her fame for himself. Erica discovers the truth and is eventually able to form a relationship with him. In 2009, All My Children let Egglesfield go and killed off Josh. Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) shoots him and Erica is then forced to decide whether or not to donate Josh's heart to a seriously ill Kendall. \"The first thought that came to my mind when I was told the storyline and read the script was Sophie's Choice,\" said Lucci. Erica reluctantly agrees to the transplant. Lucci said she believed this decision would \"haunt\" Erica because, if Kendall's life was not in the balance, she would have put more effort into saving Josh.Soap Opera Digest.

Di admits that she knew Dixie was alive the whole time. Tad is angry and rejects her. Dixie tells Tad that Kate is alive somewhere.

In \"Comfort and Joy\", he encounters Flash, who is trying to deliver a specific toy to the kids at Central City Orphanage, and accidentally breaks the toy during their scuffle. In the spirit of the holiday season and touched by Flash\u2019s dedication to the children, Ultra-Humanite calls a truce and repairs the toy, with some modifications to suit his own high-culture sensibilities (rather than rapping and making flatulence noises, the toy now delivers a narration of The Nutcracker voiced by the Ultra-Humanite's precise, upper-class enunciation).

Widespread speculation about the identity of Sam's father was reignited when it was rumored that General Hospital was looking for a \"name actor\" to cast in the role of Sam's father. Rumors began to circulate naming Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan), Blackie Parrish (John Stamos) and Dr. Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) as potential candidates for Sam's father; Lindstrom having previously worked opposite Monaco as her father on the soap opera Port Charles.  Another rumor emerged that veteran soap actor, Peter Reckell, who played Bo Brady on the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives from 1983-2012, would be joining General Hospital in the role of Evan Jerome. It was widely speculated that Reckell was cast to play Sam's father, linking her to the Jerome crime family that was prominent on General Hospital in the 1980s. However, after weeks of speculation, Reckell addressed the rumors stating that he wasn't going back to Days of Our Lives or joining any other soap.
