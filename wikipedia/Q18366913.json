Munro (1849-1930) was a British professor of mechanical engineering at Bristol and author who wrote the science fiction stories A Trip to Venus (1897), Sun-Rise in the Moon (1894) and A Message from Mars (1895). A Message from Mars was included as the first chapter of A Trip to Venus, and A Trip to Venus was included in Farewell Fantastic Venus by Brian Aldiss and Harry Harrison. Munro also wrote Heroes of the Telegraph (1891) and other historical and reference books, such as A pocket-book of electrical rules and tables for the use of electricians and engineers (1884). Because they were published before 1925, most of Munro's works are in the public domain.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Venus in fiction", "response": ["*In John Munro's A Trip to Venus (1897), the narrator, an engineer, an astronomer and his daughter travel by a newly invented flying machine to Venus and Mercury.
