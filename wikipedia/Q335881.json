Labour's election in 1964 led to reconsideration of the issue and this time the only senior dissenting voice was that of the Home Secretary, Frank Soskice. Although willing to accept the right of petition, he objected to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court on the basis that it would deprive the United Kingdom of a degree of flexibility in dealing with petitions and could lead to political embarrassment. Nonetheless, by 1965 a majority of government ministers believed that the Court would not pose a significantly greater threat to national sovereignty or to political survival than the Commission of Human Rights to which the United Kingdom was subject. Further pressure for acceptance came from the British judge and President of the Court, Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe Peter Smithers, Terence Higgins MP and various non-governmental organisations."]}, {"page": "Aldenham School", "response": ["*Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair (1885\u20131975), legal scholar, judge of the International Court of Justice, 1946\u20131959, and first President of the European Court of Human Rights, 1959\u20131965"]}, {"page": "Arnold Duncan McNair, 1st Baron McNair", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair"]}, {"page": "Sir Arnold McNair", "response": ["#redirect Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair"]}, {"page": "Arnold McNair", "response": ["#redirect Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair"]}, {"page": "McNair", "response": ["*Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair (1885\u20131975)"]}, {"page": "Arnold Duncan McNair", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair"]}]}}
