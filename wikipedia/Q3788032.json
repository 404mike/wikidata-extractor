He also had keen interest in caving from his education at Sidcot School, becoming a founder member, and first secretary, of the Wessex Cave Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Human factors and ergonomics", "response": ["The term ergonomics (from the Greek \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd, meaning \"work\", and \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, meaning \"natural law\") first entered the modern lexicon when Polish scientist Wojciech Jastrz\u0119bowski used the word in his 1857 article  (The Outline of Ergonomics; i.e. Science of Work, Based on the Truths Taken from the Natural Science). The French scholar Jean-Gustave Courcelle-Seneuil, apparently without knowledge of Jastrz\u0119bowski's article, used the word with a slightly different meaning in 1858. The introduction of the term to the English lexicon is widely attributed to British psychologist Hywel Murrell, at the 1949 meeting at the UK's Admiralty, which led to the foundation of The Ergonomics Society. He used it to encompass the studies in which he had been engaged during and after World War II.Hywel Murrell"]}]}}
