His father started a relatively briefly second-ranking branch of the Earl of Onslow's family, the land owning and land-developing heirs of much of the land of the Earls of Surrey which in 1870 became the senior branch of the family on the accession to the earldom of Guildford Onslow's nephew.\nHe was educated at Eton College and joined his father's regiment, the Scots Fusilier Guards. He reached the rank of captain and also served in the 11th Regiment of Foot. He was a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire.In October 1858, Onslow was elected at a by-election as one of the two Members of Parliament (MP) for Guildford in Surrey. He was returned at the next three general elections, holding the seat when Guildford's parliamentary representation was reduced to one seat at the 1868 general election, but at the 1874 general election he lost the seat to the Conservative Party candidate, his sixth cousin Denzil Roberts Onslow.In 1861 he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surnames of Mainwaring and Ellerker.Onslow died at the age of 68.\nOnslow married a cousin, Rosa Anne Onslow, daughter of General Denzil Onslow of Staughton House, Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire (since 1974 Cambridgeshire).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tichborne case", "response": ["The Claimant quickly acquired significant supporters; the Tichborne family's solicitor Edward Hopkins accepted him, as did J.P. Lipscomb, the family's doctor. Lipscomb, after a detailed medical examination, reported that the Claimant possessed a distinctive genital malformation. It would later be suggested that Roger Tichborne had this same defect, but this could not be established beyond speculation and hearsay.Woodruff, pp. 139\u201340McWilliam 2007, pp. 199\u2013200 Many people were impressed by the Claimant's seeming ability to recall small details of Roger Tichborne's early life, such as the fly fishing tackle he had used. Several soldiers who had served with Roger in the Dragoons, including his former batman Thomas Carter, recognised the Claimant as Roger.McWilliam 2007, p. 24 Other notable supporters included Lord Rivers, a landowner and sportsman, and Guildford Onslow, the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Guildford who became one of the Claimant's staunchest advocates. Rohan MacWilliam, in his account of the case, calls this wide degree of recognition remarkable, particularly given the Claimant's increasing physical differences from the slim Roger. By mid-June 1867 the Claimant's weight had reached almost  and would increase even more in the ensuing years.McWilliam 2007, pp. 25\u201326", "From his cell in Newgate, the Claimant vowed to resume the fight as soon as he was acquitted.Woodruff, pp. 221\u201322 On 25 March 1872 he published in the Evening Standard an \"Appeal to the Public\", requesting financial help to meet his legal and living costs: \"I appeal to every British soul who is inspired by a love of justice and fair play, and is willing to defend the weak against the strong\".McWilliam 2007, pp. 61\u201362Woodruff, pp. 223\u201324 The Claimant had gained considerable popular support during the civil trial; his fight was perceived by many as symbolising the problems faced by the working class when seeking justice in the courts. In the wake of his appeal, support committees were formed throughout the country. When he was bailed early in April, on sureties provided by Lord Rivers and Guildford Onslow, a large crowd cheered him as he left the Old Bailey."]}, {"page": "Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\"| Guildford Onslow", "| Guildford Onslow"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Guildford Onslow"]}, {"page": "Guildford James Hillier Onslow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Guildford Onslow"]}, {"page": "Guildford James Hillier Mainwaring-Ellerker-Onslow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Guildford Onslow "]}, {"page": "List of Vanity Fair (British magazine) caricatures (1875\u20131879)", "response": ["|1875-07-24||Mr Guildford Onslow||The Claimant's Friend||Ape||M 0107||25px"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1857\u20131868)", "response": ["|Guildford Onslow"]}, {"page": "Onslow (surname)", "response": ["* Guildford Onslow (1814\u20131882), English politician"]}]}}
