In the beginning of the 19th century, it was thought that people were not able to attend to more than one stimulus at a time. However, with research contributions by Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet this view was changed.  Hamilton proposed a view of attention that likened its capacity to holding marbles. You can only hold a certain number of marbles at a time before it starts to spill over. His view states that we can attend to more than one stimulus at once. William Stanley Jevons later expanded this view and stated that we can attend to up to four items at a time."]}, {"page": "William Hamilton", "response": ["*Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet (1788\u20131856), Scottish metaphysician", "*Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet (1788\u20131856), Scottish metaphysician"]}, {"page": "Sir William Hamilton, Bart", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet"]}, {"page": "Thomas Brown (philosopher)", "response": ["Brown's philosophy occupies an intermediate place between the earlier Scottish school and the later associational psychology, to which he really belonged.
