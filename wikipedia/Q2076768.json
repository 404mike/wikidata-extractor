His experience in the Caribbean, where he \"quickly absorbed the plantation owners' views about slavery\",Hochschild, p. 186. lent weight to his position, which was perceived as well-argued and just by some of his contemporaries.Ziegler, pp. 97\u201399. In his first speech before Parliament he called himself \"an attentive observer of the state of the negroes\" who found them well cared for and \"in a state of humble happiness\".Hochschild, p. 187. Others thought it \"shocking that so young a man, under no bias of interest, should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade\".Zachary Macaulay writing to Miss Mills, 1 June 1799, quoted in Ziegler, p. 98. In his speech to the House, William insulted William Wilberforce, the leading abolitionist, saying: \"the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites, and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce\".Fulford, p. 121.

In 1804, Clarkson resumed his work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, strengthened with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, it was too late in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not."]}, {"page": "Clapham Sect", "response": ["Lampooned in their day as \"the saints\", the group published a journal, the Christian Observer, edited by Zachary Macaulay and were also credited with the foundation of several missionary and tract societies, including the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Church Missionary Society.", "* Zachary Macaulay (1768\u20131838), estate manager, governor of Sierra Leone, father of Thomas Babington Macaulay"]}, {"page": "Clapham", "response": ["In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Clapham Sect were a group of wealthy City merchants (mostly evangelical Anglican) social reformers who lived around the Common.

They were very prominent in campaigns for the abolition of slavery and child labour, and for prison reform. They also promoted missionary activities in Britain's colonies. The Society for Missions to Africa and the East (as the Church Mission Society was first called) was founded on 12 April 1799 at a meeting of the Eclectic Society, supported by members of the Clapham Sect, who met under the guidance of John Venn, the Rector of Clapham.

Numerous Britons expressed discontent over a Dutch settler exhibiting an enslaved woman in the country. A British abolitionist society, the African Association, conducted a newspaper campaign for her release. The British abolitionist Zachary Macaulay led the protest, with Hendrik Cesars protesting in response that Baartman was entitled to earn her living, stating: \"has she not as good a right to exhibit herself as an Irish Giant or a Dwarf?\" Cesars was comparing Baartman to the contemporary Irish giants Charles Byrne and Patrick Cotter O'Brien.Lederman, Muriel and Ingrid Bartsch (2001). The Gender and Science Reader. New York: Routledge, p. 351. Macaulay and The African Association took the matter to court and on 24 November 1810 at the Court of King's Bench the Attorney-General began the attempt \"to give her liberty to say whether she was exhibited by her own consent.\" In support he produced two affidavits in court. The first, from a William Bullock of Liverpool Museum, was intended to show that Baartman had been brought to Britain by individuals who referred to her as if she were property. The second, by the Secretary of the African Association, described the degrading conditions under which she was exhibited and also gave evidence of coercion. Baartman was then questioned before an attorney in Dutch, in which she was fluent, via interpreters. However, the conditions of the interview were stacked against her, in part again because the court focused on the Boer Cesars' involvement in bringing Baartman to London, while largely ignoring Dunlop's role in the affair; it prevented Cesars from being in the room when Baartman made her state, but allowed Dunlop to remain.", "Historians have subsequently stated that this therefore casts great doubt on the veracity and independence of the statement that Baartman then made. She stated that she in fact was not under restraint, had not been sexually abused and had come to London on her own free will. She also did not wish to return to her family and understood perfectly that she was guaranteed half of the profits. The case was therefore dismissed. She was questioned for three hours. The statements directly contradict accounts of her exhibitions made by Zachary Macaulay of the African Institution and other eyewitnesses. A written contract was produced,\"Dunlop produced a contract signed by himself and Sara dated 29 October 1810, which was to run from the preceding March for five years. This stated that she was his domestic servant and would allow herself to be exhibited in public in return for 12 guineas a year.\" which is considered by some modern commentators to be a legal subterfuge."]}, {"page": "Helensburgh", "response": ["*Zachary Macaulay, mathematician and abolitionist"]}, {"page": "Beilby Porteus", "response": ["These were the first challenges to the establishment in an eventual 26-year campaign to eradicate slavery in the British West Indian colonies. Porteus made a huge contribution and eventually turned to other means of achieving his aims, including writing, encouraging political initiatives, and supporting the sending of mission workers to Barbados and Jamaica. Deeply concerned about the lot of the slaves as a result of the reports he received, Porteus became a committed and passionate abolitionist, the most senior cleric of his day to take an active part in the campaign against slavery. He became involved with the group of abolitionists at Teston in Kent, led by Sir Charles Middleton, and soon became acquainted with William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, Henry Thornton, Zachary Macaulay and other committed activists. Many of this group were members of the so-called Clapham Sect of evangelical social reformers and Porteus willingly lent his support to them and their campaigns.", "In 1787, Porteus was translated to the bishopric of London on the advice of Prime Minister William Pitt, a position he held until his death in 1809. As is customary, he was also appointed to the Privy Council, and Dean of the Chapel Royal. In 1788, he supported Sir William Dolben's Slave Trade Bill from the bench of bishops, and over the next quarter century he became the leading advocate within the Church of England for the abolition of slavery, lending support to such men as Wilberforce, Granville Sharp, Henry Thornton and Zachary Macaulay to secure the eventual passage of the Slave Trade Act in 1807."]}, {"page": "Hannah More", "response": ["In the 1780s Hannah More became a friend of James Oglethorpe, who had long been concerned with slavery as a moral issue and who was working with Granville Sharp as an early abolitionist.Thomas Wilson, The Oglethorpe Plan.

By this time she was close to William Wilberforce and Zachary Macaulay, sympathising with their evangelical views. Her poem Slavery appeared in 1788.

He subsequently became the editor or author of a majority of the Anti-Slavery Society's publications (generally anonymously) and, following the passing of the Emancipation Act in 1833, his legal expertise allowed him to become the official counsel for the society. Beldam's efforts at this period were mostly investigating abuses of the interim measures by which slaves would become apprenticed to their former masters as a means of allowing them to develop as fully independent, free citizens. Thanks to Beldam's careful collection of information, Parliament was forced to end the apprenticeship system in 1838, three years early."]}, {"page": "Henry Weekes", "response": ["*Bust of Zachary Macaulay with medallion depicting the kneeling figure of a slave, Westminster Abbey, London (1842)"]}, {"page": "Barnet Burns", "response": ["At the age of 13 or 14 he became a cabin boy and ended up working for Louis Celeste Lecesne in Jamaica.
