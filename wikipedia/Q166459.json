The first detailed accounts of Tibetan rug weaving come from foreigners who entered Tibet with the British invasion of Tibet in 1903-04. Both Laurence WaddellLhasa and its Mysteries, by L Austine Waddell, John Murray, London, 1905 and Perceval LandonThe Opening of Tibet, by Perceval Landon, Doubleday, New York, 1905 described a weaving workshop they encountered near Gyantse, en route to Lhasa. Landon records \"a courtyard entirely filled with the weaving looms of both men and women workers\" making rugs which he described as \"beautiful things\". The workshop was owned and run by one of the local aristocratic families, which was the norm in premodern Tibet. Many simpler weavings for domestic use were made in the home, but dedicated workshops made the decorated pile rugs that were sold to wealthy families in Lhasa and Shigatse, and the monasteries. The monastic institutions housed thousands of monks, who sat on long, low platforms during religious ceremonies, that were nearly always covered in hand-woven carpets for comfort. Wealthier monasteries replaced these carpets regularly, providing income, or taking gifts in lieu of taxation, from hundreds or thousands of weavers."]}, {"page": "Bhimsen Thapa", "response": ["Bhimsen Thapa was a military leader and a de facto ruler of Nepal.
