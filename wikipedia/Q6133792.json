She completed her M.Sc. in Integrated Electronic Devices at the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es (INSA) in Lyon, France in 1998. After completing her Masters, Lacour remained at INSA and conducted her graduate studies in Electrical Engineering from 1998 to 2001. In 2001, Lacour moved to the United States to work under the mentorship of Dr. Sigurd Wagner as postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University. During her time at Princeton, Lacour made significant advancements in developing stretchable electronics that could be implemented in biological systems more easily than typical electronic hardware. Lacour finished her postdoctoral work in 2005 and began further postdoctoral work at the University of Cambridge under the mentorship of Dr. James Fawcett where she began to explore the therapeutic potential of her technologies in repairing nerves after injury. In 2007, Lacour received the University Research Fellowship from the Royal Society and became a Research Project Manager and head of the Stretchable Bioelectronics group at the Nanoscience Centre in Cambridge, UK."]}]}}
