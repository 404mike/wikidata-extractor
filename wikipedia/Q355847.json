He is the current Manager of Scarborough Athletic, of the Northern Premier League.\nGreening began his career in 1996 with York City, but moved to Manchester United in 1998, with whom he won the 1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League as a non-playing substitute in the final. However, he failed to make a breakthrough in the Manchester United first team and followed United assistant manager Steve McClaren to Middlesbrough in 2001. During his time at Middlesbrough, Greening earned his first call-up to the England national team, but he did not make an appearance. In 2004, he joined West Bromwich Albion for \u00a31.25 million, and, in 2008, captained the team to the Championship title. Greening signed for Fulham in 2009 and helped them to the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final, before signing permanently the following summer.

For the last match of the season, away to Queens Park Rangers, fans of West Bromwich Albion chose to dress up as superheroes in honour of Phillips, who is nicknamed \"Super Kev\"; Albion won the match 2\u20130 to win promotion to the Premier League as champions. Phillips won numerous awards over the season. He received Player-of-the-Year awards from both the West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club and from the club itself, after scoring 24 goals from 30 starts and finishing as the Championship's second top goalscorer.

Carson, who had played for five different clubs since making his debut for Leeds in 2004, explained that he wanted to get settled at one club, saying \"I've been like a nomad for three or four years. It'll be good to get some roots and hopefully settle. I can see myself here for four or five years, even longer.\" He made his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Arsenal in the opening match of the 2008\u201309 Premier League season. Despite relegation to the Championship, Carson kept his first team place and after the departure of captain Jonathan Greening he was given the captaincy. West Bromwich Albion won promotion back to the Premier League, finishing second, 12 points clear of third place Nottingham Forest with Carson keeping 15 clean sheets out of 43 matches. He had been playing regular football for the Midlands club, but in the 2010\u201311 season, his form seemed to dip and in January 2011, Carson was briefly dropped to the bench for Welsh goalkeeper Boaz Myhill.

He scored twice in a 4\u20131 League Cup win against Bradford City on 20 September 2005, his first goals for the club. He generally struggled in his first ever season in the Premier League, as his season was damaged by a series of niggling injuries and a shoulder problem, but he still managed to score eight goals. Ellington's first Premiership goals came in the 4\u20130 win against Everton; he scored a goal in either half by a penalty and a long range shot. He became quite unpopular with the West Brom fans towards the end of the same season because of his complaint of a \"bruised toe\", and his refusal to have painkilling injections to help him through such a minor complaint. He almost redeemed himself near the end of the season though, when he scored for Albion in the 1\u20131 draw with Birmingham and almost went on to score the winner as a substitute, hitting the woodwork. In June 2006, West Bromwich Albion rejected an undisclosed offer for Ellington from his former club Wigan Athletic, insisting that the player was \"not for sale\"."]}, {"page": "Roy Hodgson", "response": ["Players joining Fulham before the 2009\u201310 season included right back Stephen Kelly and midfielders Bj\u00f8rn Helge Riise, Damien Duff and Jonathan Greening. Hodgson enjoyed a fantastic run in the Europa League. The club's campaign, which started in July 2009 in the third qualifying round, featured impressive performances in the group stage, including defeating Basel at the hostile St. Jakob-Park in the final group game to qualify for the knockout stage at the expense of the Swiss club. In the following rounds, Fulham went on to eliminate holders Shakhtar Donetsk 3\u20132 on aggregate, Italian runners-up Juventus 5\u20134 on aggregate and German champions Wolfsburg 3\u20131 on aggregate. The victory against Juventus was especially memorable. Fulham lost 3\u20131 in Turin and went 4\u20131 down on aggregate in the second minute of the second leg at Craven Cottage. However, a goal from Bobby Zamora, a brace from Zolt\u00e1n Gera and a late winner from Clint Dempsey meant that Fulham won the tie 5\u20134 on aggregate. On 29 April 2010, Hodgson guided Fulham to their first major European final in their 130-year history, winning the home leg 2\u20131 after a 0\u20130 away draw to gain a 2\u20131 aggregate victory over Hamburg in the Europa League semi-final. In the final on 12 May at the HSH Nordbank Arena in Hamburg, Fulham played Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The game went to extra time at 1\u20131 after first-half goals from Diego Forl\u00e1n and Simon Davies. With a penalty shoot-out looming and just four minutes remaining, Forl\u00e1n scored again to win the game for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. In the Premier League, the Europa League commitments showed as their League form became inconsistent. Fulham lost four of their first six games before losing only one of their following twelve. Five successive defeats preceded a run of five unbeaten. Three straight defeats were then followed by three unbeaten before their final four games garnered one win and three defeats, meaning the club finished twelfth, just four points off ninth place.
