For the tennis player see Edward Corrie (tennis).\nEdward Lyall Corrie (January 1848 - 1931) was an English rower who won  Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta three times.\nCorrie was born in Liverpool, the son of Edgar Corrie, a merchant, and his wife Helen.Corrie moved to London where he became a discount broker. He rowed for Kingston Rowing Club where he was coached by Walter Bradford Woodgate. In 1866, he partnered Woodgate to win Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta.  This was the infamous occasion when Woodgate entered the event twice, using the name Wat Bradford in the other entry when he partnered another Kingstonian M M Brown. The rules of entry at the regatta were subsequently revised to prevent this. Corrie partnered  M M Brown in 1867  to win Silver Goblets again. In 1870 Corrie partnered E Hall for his third win of SIlver Goblets. He was captain of Kingston in 1872 when he was party to the revision of the laws of Boat Racing.Corrie died at Reigate at the age of 83.\nCorrie married Julia Sophia Hammond at St George Hanover Square in 1872.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jimmy Wang (tennis)", "response": ["| Edward Corrie   Trevor Dobson"]}, {"page": "Kingston Rowing Club", "response": ["* Edward Corrie"]}, {"page": "Jamie Baker (tennis)", "response": ["| Edward Corrie"]}, {"page": "Walter Bradford Woodgate", "response": ["*1866 \u2013 Silver Goblets (with Edward Corrie)", "Woodgate caused controversy at Henley Royal Regatta and his actions twice resulted in changes to Henley's rules.
