He rowed for Kingston Rowing Club where he was coached by Walter Bradford Woodgate. In 1866, he partnered Woodgate to win Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta.  This was the infamous occasion when Woodgate entered the event twice, using the name Wat Bradford in the other entry when he partnered another Kingstonian M M Brown.
