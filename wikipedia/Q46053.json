Dunn appeared in both series of The Tony Hancock Show and made many appearances with Tony Hancock, Michael Bentine, Dora Bryan and Dick Emery, among others, before winning the role of Jones in Dad's Army in 1968.\nAfter Dad's Army ended, Dunn capitalised on his skill in playing elderly character roles by playing the lead character Charlie Quick, in the slapstick children's TV series Grandad, from 1979 to 1984.\nDunn died in Portugal, where he had settled in the region of Algarve, on 6 November 2012 as a result of complications from an operation that had taken place earlier that week.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Father Ted", "response": ["The show was already scheduled to conclude with the third season prior to Morgan's death, as Morgan said that he did not want to continue playing the role of Father Ted for fear of being typecast: \"I don't want to be the next Clive Dunn and end up playing the same character for years.\""]}, {"page": "January 9", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 Clive Dunn, English actor (d. 2012)"]}, {"page": "Michael Bentine", "response": ["On his return to Britain in 1954, he worked as a scriptwriter for Peter Sellers and then on 39 episodes of his own radio show Round the Bend in 30 Minutes, which has also been wiped from the BBC archive.
