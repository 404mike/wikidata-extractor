He played for Redruth R.F.C. and was capped 26 times for Cornwall.He was a member of the Cornwall rugby union team, which on 26 October 1908 won the Olympic silver medal for Great Britain. He also played for Cornwall in the County Championship final match against Durham that same year, at Redruth, scoring twice in a famous 17-3 victory, Bert was capped by England against Wales in 1910, the first year Twickenham opened and scored a wonderful individual try in a 11-6 win. Although being selected for further matches against Scotland, Ireland and France he declined and also declined an invitation to tour with the British and Irish Lions in 1908 to Australia and New Zealand. Around the same time, it was reported that he refused 400 golden sovereigns to sign for a Rugby league team in the north of England.\nIn 1910 when he was just 25 years old and in his prime Bert Solomon hung his boots up and a legend was created.\nIt is also reported that Bert was a solitary character, who like nothing better than his pigeons. Sometimes he refused to play for Redruth if his pigeons were still out, and often had to be cajoled into playing. Such was his skill that he apparently made a difference of 1000 people on a crowd.\nThe Solomon legacy will forever live in the hearts and memories of all Cornish rugby supporters, he excited a generation of Cornish folk with his dazzling skills, a rugby genius who was outshining the greatest internationals of his era and who at the end of the day was happier out of the spotlight.\nThere is now a book published regarding his life and career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["Penzance RFC and England international winger Barrie Bennetts had to withdraw with an injury in the morning and was replaced by Barney Solomon \u2013 the elder brother of the much more famous Bert.
