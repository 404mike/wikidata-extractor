He was honorary professor of poetry at the Manchester Royal Institution, and in 1856 was granted a civil list pension. His friends included Robert Southey. Swain's epitaph for John Horsefield is noted by English Heritage as an element of their rationale for listing Horsefield's tomb as a Grade II monument.Charles Swain was born to an English father and French mother in Every Street, Manchester, England, on 4 January 1801, He received an education and began work when aged 15 as a clerk for Tavar\u00e9 and Horrocks, a dye-works that was part-owned by a maternal uncle. He married Ann Glover in January 1827 and the couple went on to have five daughters and a son, of which four daughters lived to become adults.Swain left his job at the dye-works after fourteen years to become a bookseller. That venture did not last and two years later he joined Lockett & Co., a firm of engravers and lithographers in Manchester. He had artistic interests \u2013 as indicated by his memoir of Henry Liverseege, the Mancunian artist, and books such as A Cabinet of Poetry and Romance: Female Portraits from the Writings of Byron and Scott (1845) \u2013 and he went on to buy the engraving department from the firm and to run it himself.By the time the bookselling venture ended, Swain was already friends with Robert Southey and with other literary names. His poems had been published in journals from 1822 onwards and he had also had various more substantial works published, such as Metrical Essays on Subjects of History and Imagination (1827), Beauties of the Mind: a Poetical Sketch with Lays Historical and Romantic (1831) and The Mind (1832).Swain died on 22 September 1874 as the result of an epileptic fit. He had been living at Prestwich Park, Prestwich, at the time, in a house bought for him by friends. His wife died four years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["Lascelles Abercrombie \u2013 Percy Addleshaw \u2013 Douglas Ainslie \u2013 Thomas Bailie Aldrich \u2013 William Alexander \u2013 William Allingham \u2013 Sir Edwin Arnold \u2013 Matthew Arnold \u2013 Thomas Ashe \u2013 Alfred Austin \u2013 William Edmonstoune Aytoun \u2013 Philip James Bailey \u2013 Richard Harris Barham \u2013 Maurice Baring \u2013 George Barlow \u2013 Jane Barlow \u2013 William Barnes \u2013 Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield \u2013 Thomas Lovell Beddoes \u2013 Henry Charles Beeching \u2013 Charles Dent Bell \u2013 Hilaire Belloc \u2013 Arthur Christopher Benson \u2013 Laurence Binyon \u2013 John Stuart Blackie \u2013 Richard Doddridge Blackmore \u2013 Mathilde Blind \u2013 Wilfrid Scawen Blunt \u2013 George Henry Boker \u2013 Gordon Bottomley \u2013 Francis William Bourdillon \u2013 Robert Bridges \u2013 Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Rupert Brooke \u2013 Robert Barnabas Brough \u2013 Oliver Madox Brown \u2013 Thomas Edward Brown \u2013 Elizabeth Barrett Browning \u2013 Robert Browning \u2013 William Cullen Bryant \u2013 Robert Buchanan \u2013 Arthur Gray Butler \u2013 Wathen Mark Wilks Call \u2013 Thomas Carlyle \u2013 Bliss Carman \u2013 John Clare \u2013 Caroline Clive \u2013 Arthur Hugh Clough \u2013 Hartley Coleridge \u2013 Mary E.
