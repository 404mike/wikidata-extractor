The line-up increased with the addition of bassist/multi-instrumentalist Yorkie \u2013 who started working with the band years before their success with Spiders \u2013 in late 1996, so that Scott could concentrate more on vocals and guitar.", "A tour of the US followed in mid-1997, which was less successful than many had hoped, with stories of homesickness and, in Murphy's, case a severe nervous breakdown, as well as Scott losing his voice for two months. The death of Yorkie's mother Gladys Palmer, a local Liverpool singer, devastated the band, and Parle left the group straight after the band completed work on their second album. Caffrey was quickly chosen to take over from Parle.", "Since the band's original break-up, most of the former members have continued to play in bands and music industry: Scott, along with Phil Hartley, a former live technician for the group, formed a punk band called the Drellas, which in its final incarnation included Allan Jones on drums and Ryan Clarke on vintage keys. Hartley, who plays bass, also produces for the band, along with other Antipop Records acts such as Metro Manila Aide, The Dead Class, The Temps and Fraktures.

He has already contributed backing to vocals on \"Neighbourhood\", one of the band's biggest hits from Spiders, and was involved in the production of several of the album's B-sides, but he was asked to join the band proper as their full-time bassist, which allowed Scott to focus on his vocals. However, shortly after joining the band, the death of his mother Gladys Palmer, a Liverpudlian singer who owned the rehearsal rooms Space practised in, came as a devastation to the group. Her death brought a \"tinge of sadness\" to the recording sessions.", "For \"The Ballad of Tom Jones\", Cerys Matthews of the Welsh band Catatonia, who Space had supported live back in 1996, was brought in to duet with Scott, which fueled rumours in the press that the two were linked romantically, when in fact they were just good friends. Yorkie provided the scratch-track for Matthews' vocals in the song's demo."]}, {"page": "Spiders (album)", "response": ["Whilst on tour, the band discovered the music of hip-hop group Cypress Hill, and quickly became attracted to their bass-driven grooves and use of sampling. Soon after, they decided to recruit Scott's friend and former bandmember in Hello Sunset, Franny Griffiths, who at the time was living and working at a nightclub in Ibiza, in joining the band on keyboards and electronics, establishing the band's trademark, multi-genre style. Although Griffiths was unimpressed by the demo tape that they had sent him, he agreed to join them on the condition that they start writing better material. Early versions of \"Mister Psycho\", \"Kill Me\", \"Neighbourhood\", \"Money\" and \"Spiders\" were amongst the songs the band demoed under the new line-up, and were recorded in their friend David \"Yorkie\" Palmer's bedroom. According to Griffiths, he had to sell off his car in order to purchase his first sampler. Successful indie label Gut Records (who previously had chart hits with Right Said Fred on their sub-label Tug) paid attention to the band as they had started initiated a sub-label that was also named Hug Records, asking Mark Cowley for permission to release music with the same company name.", "Scott composed all of his songs for the album on bass guitar, namely a Framus 5/150 Star Bass and Vox Teardrop from the 1950s and 1960s. In 2018, Scott stated that he has a personal preference of using older instruments and equipment, saying \"I was against effects back then, to tell you the truth. I\u2019m not into being retro for its own sake, but basically I just couldn\u2019t be arsed pressing loads of pedals. My sound just needed to be dubby. I took all the treble right off the amps\". An Ibanez fretless bass was used in the recording of \"Female of the Species\" to emulate a double bass, as according to Scott, \"it was the only way to get that sound. I was dead against it at first, because it seemed so naff and cheesy. At the time, only people who had their basses really high on their chests played those instruments\".. \"Female of the Species\" was initially performed using a straight beat, until Griffiths came up with the idea to \"stick scratching samples and a hip-hop swing underneath the track\". As such, in the studio's basement, Parle, using only one microphone (\"the minimum of studio technology\"), \"merely bunged a load of delay on the resulting loop\". David \"Yorkie\" Palmer sang backing vocals on \"Neighbourhood\", although he had yet to officially join the band, though he assisted them in recording many of the album's B-sides.Liner notes.", "Space played several prolific festivals in this era, and numerous shows that were well received by British critics. A concert played by the band in Dublin in November 1996 was attended by Universal Records staff and their guests; it was integral in the label singing the band in the United States. After the minor success of Spiders and especially \"Female of the Species\" in the United States, Space toured the US in mid-1997. However, the tour was marked with numerous problems. The band were constantly under stress, and such was its extent that Griffiths developed an ulcer, Scott lost his voice and Murphy, \"still only 21, simply lost it completely and had a spell in psychiatric care being fed anti-depressants and milk,\" whilst Parle eventually left the band, being replaced by Leon Caffrey soon afterwards. After his cameo on Spiders, David \"Yorkie\" Palmer joined the band in late 1997 as a bassist, but the death of his mother, popular Liverpullidan singer Gladys Palmer, came as a devastation to the band."]}, {"page": "Suburban Rock 'n' Roll", "response": ["In a webcast interview in 2003, Bassist David \"Yorkie\" Palmer elaborated on the concept of Suburban Rock 'n' Roll: \"The album basically deals with the subject of surveillance and a certain loss of freedom in modern society. On different levels from like the tiny sort of restrictive signs you see everywhere like you know: no ball games, no trespassing, no dogs, no cycling, clean it up to more oppressive things on a larger scale such as cameras in the back of police vans, helicopters with cameras in. Generally the whole idea that even though you may think you live in the most idyllic place every place comes with its own restrictions that prohibit you doing certain things and we just found it interesting because it seems to be an unnameable group of people who put these restrictions into place, it doesn't seem to be by general consensus.\" Some of the lyrics deal with Tommy Scott's feelings of raising a family in suburbia, and how it parallels with having grown up on a council estate plagued by high levels of crime and unemployment (as previously discussed in the song \"Neighbourhood\"), as well as his opinions and experiences in the music industry.", "Whilst recording Suburban Rock 'N' Roll, the band made a conscious decision not to repeat the sound of their last two albums, and set out to explore more experimental methods, with a greater emphasis on sampling. Jamie Murphy's departure affected the direction of the music, as Yorkie noted: \"Some of the tracks have no noticeable guitar whereas you know Jamie being a proper sort of guitar hero type person wouldn't allow that, it would, if there was a space there for guitar there would be guitar. So it's a little bit sparser, maybe a little bit more disciplined the sound and its allowed I think texture wise like the keyboards and other things that we use like the samples to come through a bit more.\" The band credited the New York synth punk duo Suicide as a big influence on the album, and would often listen to their debut album on their way to the studio, providing inspiration for the track \"Pretty Suicide\".", "Keyboardist Franny Griffiths defended the album's lack of dance tracks, which had been somewhat of a tradition on previous Space releases: \"For me it's better. People might say why's there no dance tracks or maybe there's no Yorkie tracks, but I think when you listen back to it you'll see why them things aren't on it because its more consistent, even though it's all our different ideas, it's at a better blend, it runs better and you can listen to each track after each other no problem. You're not jumping from one track to another, you want to actually listen to it from start to finish.\"", "* Dave \"Yorkie\" Palmer \u2013 bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals", "* Dave \"Yorkie\" Palmer \u2013 layout & design"]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Dave \"Yorkie\" Palmer (Space)"]}, {"page": "Music for Aliens", "response": ["While they were busy finding a new label and working on their next album, Space released these tracks in order to keep their waiting fans happy.

Several of the songs that made it onto Attack of the Mutant 50ft Kebab, including the title track, \"Anthony's Brainwaves\" and \"Happy Clowns\" (then known as \"Gone in an Instant\" or \"Cash Converters\" by fans), were written by Scott and performed live during this period.  Meanwhile, keyboardist Franny Griffiths started making music under the moniker Subway Showdown and later played in the band Dust with original Space guitarist Jamie Murphy, whilst Yorkie returned to producing for other bands and formed a new group Moongoose."]}]}}
