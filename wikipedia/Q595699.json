Some thought that the base of the metric system could be attacked by pointing out some errors that crept into the measurement of the two French scientists. M\u00e9chain had even noticed an inaccuracy he did not dare to admit. As this survey was also part of the groundwork for the map of France, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked, from 1861 to 1866, the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected.

In 1870, Fran\u00e7ois Perrier was in charge of resuming the triangulation between Dunkirk and Barcelona.

The aim of the survey was to establish precise geographical coordinates of almost 300 significant landmarks which could be used as the fixed points of local topographic surveys from which maps could be drawn. In addition there was a purely scientific aim in providing precise data for geodetic calculations such as the determination of the length of meridian arcs and the figure of the Earth. Such a  survey had  been proposed by William Roy (1726\u20131790) on his completion of the Anglo-French Survey but it was only after his death that the  Board of Ordnance initiated the trigonometric survey, motivated by military considerations in a time of a threatened French invasion. Most of the work was carried out under the direction of Isaac Dalby,  William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby, but the final synthesis and report (1858) was the work of Alexander Ross Clarke.
