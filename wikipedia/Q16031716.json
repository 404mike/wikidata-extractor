Of M\u0101ori descent, he identified with the Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu and Rangit\u0101ne iwi. He was born in Whakatomotomo, Wairarapa, New Zealand in about 1843. From 1892, he was a member of Te Kotahitanga, the autonomous M\u0101ori Parliament. One of six candidates in the  for the Eastern Maori electorate, he came second to the incumbent, Wi Pere. He was one of the owners of Lake Wairarapa and took a stance supportive of the government's view of land ownership. His support was acknowledged by him being appointed captain of a volunteer force, and he was to train 18 M\u0101ori as a guard of honour for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Richard Seddon, Tunuiarangi, and his guard of honour travelled to London on the Ruahine. In conjunction with Wi Pere and James Carroll, he had secretly prepared a petition concerning the remaining land held by M\u0101ori to remain in their ownership in perpetuity. Scottish MP John McAusland Denny presented the petition on Tunuiarangi's behalf to Joseph Chamberlain, and Tunuiarangi received an invitation from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to explain his concerns. The petition caused great embarrassment to the Liberal Government of New Zealand, and is regarded as one of the reasons of the government passing the Native Lands Settlement and Administration Bill 1898, the precursor to the Maori Lands Administration Act 1900."]}]}}
