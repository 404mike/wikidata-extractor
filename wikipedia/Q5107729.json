Either side of a loss to Wasps, they had convincing wins over newly promoted Leeds Carnegie and over Sale Sharks, only their second home win over Sale since they joined the top flight in 2004\u201305, which was then followed by an unlucky loss at champions Leicester Tigers. A poor spell followed with 10 games without a win. During the winless spell, the club did become the first Premiership team to draw four games in a season and the first team to draw three successive league games. Following this bad spell, the Warriors secured a much needed 13\u20130 victory over Newcastle at Sixways, before another six consecutive losses. On 25 April, the Warriors were relegated from the Premiership after a 12\u201310 loss away to Leeds Carnegie, their first relegation in 22 years. They played the 2010\u201311 season in the Championship with Richard Hill as the new head coach, on a 2-year contract and Chris Pennell as the new captain.", "However, after releasing a number of older players the club began a rebuilding phase led by Ryan who recruited young talents unable to get game-time at big clubs. Warriors achieved promotion back to the Premiership at their first attempt, beating Bristol in the playoffs thanks to a last minute Chris Pennell try and Ryan Lamb conversion. The club also managed to win the B&I Cup defeating Doncaster 35\u20135."]}, {"page": "Graham Dilley", "response": ["He was married and divorced twice and had four children, including Chris Pennell, who has played rugby union for England and Worcester Warriors,Gallagher B (2007)Chris Pennell chooses oval ball, The Daily Telegraph, 20 December 2007.
