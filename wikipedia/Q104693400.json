He signed for the Diamonds as a teenager from the junior leagues in 1927, having a difficult task of not only finding a role in the strong side of the 1920s which challenged consistently for the Scottish Football League title and won the Scottish Cup in 1924, but also specifically replacing Bob McPhail, the team's inside left who had moved on to Rangers.\nHe became an increasingly important member of the team (although collectively they were unable to match the standards set earlier in the period), moving to outside left after the departure of Jimmy Somerville in 1930. In the 1931\u201332 season, his contribution was 41 league and cup appearances (including the semi-final loss to Kilmarnock) and seven goals, plus a selection for the Scottish Football League XI, but he played only six times in the following campaign before his career was halted by a broken leg, and he was released by Airdrie before its end.Short spells with few appearances followed at top-tier sides Hamilton Academical, Partick Thistle and Queen of the South, then a year at second-level King's Park where he featured slightly more often, but he then dropped out of senior football aged 28.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Bertram", "response": ["George Bertram may refer to:", "*George Bertram (footballer, born 1896), (1896\u20131963), English footballer for Fulham, Brentford", "*George Bertram (footballer, born 1908), (1908\u20131972), Scottish footballer for Airdrieonians"]}, {"page": "George Bertram (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Bertram (footballer, born 1908)"]}]}}
