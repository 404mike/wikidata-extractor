In addition to originating the \"mannequin parade\", a precursor to the modern fashion show, and training the first professional models, she launched slit skirts and low necklines, popularized less restrictive corsets, and promoted alluring and pared-down lingerie.Opening branches of her London house, Lucile Ltd, in Chicago, New York City, and Paris, her business became the first global couture brand, dressing a trend-setting clientele of royalty, nobility, and stage and film personalities. Duff-Gordon is also remembered as a survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, and as the losing party in the precedent-setting 1917 contract law case of Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, in which Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo wrote the opinion for New York's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals, upholding a contract between Duff-Gordon and her advertising agent that assigned the agent the sole right to market her name. It was the first case of its kind, clothes labelled and sold at a lowered cost in a cheaper market under an expensive \"brand name\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 20", "response": ["*  1935   \u2013 Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, English fashion designer (b. 1863)"]}, {"page": "June 13", "response": ["*1863 \u2013 Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, English fashion designer (d. 1935)"]}, {"page": "1863", "response": ["* June 13 \u2013 Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, English fashion designer (d. 1942)"]}, {"page": "1935", "response": ["* April 20 \u2013 Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, British fashion designer (b. 1863)"]}, {"page": "Elinor Glyn", "response": ["The family lived in Guelph for seven years at a stone home that still stands near the University of Guelph.
