He was Lincoln's leading scorer in the \n1993\u201394 season with 13 goals in all competitions. After leaving Lincoln in 1996 he joined Conference club Altrincham.Dave took a break from football after leaving Altrincham. After the break he joined Thundridge City FC as a player-coach, his most memorable moment being his overhead kick in a league match. He has now taken on a full coaching role for the club and has led the team to two top half finishes, two seasons in a row. Thundridge City FC earned promotion in the 2015/16 season.\nDespite Johnson enjoying early success with Thundridge, he has recently found himself under pressure from the club's board following a poor first half of the 2016/17 season. Dubbed the \"Yorkshire Ranieri\", he matches the Italian's Leicester record in finding success one season, followed by disappointment the next.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Johnson", "response": ["*David Johnson (nephrologist), Australian kidney specialist", "*C.
