He was a right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper.Mobey played for Surrey from 1930 to 1938 but he was essentially their reserve wicketkeeper as understudy to Ted Brooks. Mobey would have toured India with the England national cricket team in 1939\u201340 if Marylebone Cricket Club's scheduled tour had gone ahead. The team had been selected but the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939 caused the tour's immediate cancellation.Mobey was born at Surbiton and died at Woking, both in Surrey. He made 81 first-class appearances according to CricketArchive, scoring 1,684 runs @ 18.10 with a highest innings of 75, one of six half-centuries. He held 127 catches and completed 11 stumpings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)", "response": ["In World War II, McIntyre served in the British Army in North Africa, and was wounded in the Anzio landings, ending as a sergeant in the APTC. He became friends with the Bedser twins near the end of the war when all three served in Italy. After the war, he successfully filled in for Surrey as an emergency wicket-keeper, and took over the position permanently from Gerald Mobey when he retired in 1946. In addition to his excellent wicket-keeping, he was a strong first-class batsman, and passed 1,000 runs on three occasions. He was kept out of the England cricket team by Godfrey Evans. He made his Test debut alongside David Sheppard and Malcolm Hilton in the fourth Test against the West Indies at the Oval in 1950, when Evans was incapacitated with a broken thumb. He toured Australia and New Zealand with the MCC that winter, and played in the first Test of the 1950-51 Ashes series as a batsman, with Evans keeping wicket. He played his third and last Test in the fourth Test against South Africa at Headingley in 1955, his benefit season, when Evans was again injured. Evans was still not available for the fifth Test, but McIntyre was also not able to play. He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1958."]}]}}
