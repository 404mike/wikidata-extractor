(The American poet William Theodore Peters, who commissioned Dowson's piece and would play Pierrot in its premiere,. published a poetic \"Epilogue\" for it in 1896, and the composer Sir Granville Bantock would later contribute an orchestral prologue [1908].) One of the gadflies of Aestheticism, W. S. Gilbert, introduced Harlequin and Pierrot as love-struck twin brothers into Eyes and No Eyes, or The Art of Seeing (1875), for which Thomas German Reed wrote the music. And he ensured that neither character, contrary to many an Aesthetic Pierrot, would be amorously disappointed."]}, {"page": "Lord Alfred Douglas", "response": ["Douglas married poetess Olive Custance in 1902. They had a son, Raymond. Converting to Roman Catholicism in 1911, Douglas repudiated Wilde's homosexuality and in a High-Catholic magazine, Plain English, expressed openly anti-Semitic views, while rejecting the policies of Nazi Germany. He was jailed for libelling Winston Churchill over claims of World War I misconduct. Douglas wrote several books of verse, some in a homoerotic Uranian genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" came in one of them (Two Loves), though widely misattributed to Wilde.", "After Wilde's death, Douglas made a close friendship with Olive Custance, a bisexual heiress and poet. They married on 4 March 1902. Olive Custance was in a relationship with the writer Natalie Barney when she and Douglas first met. Barney and Douglas eventually became close friends and Barney was named godmother to their son, Raymond Wilfred Sholto Douglas, born on 17 November 1902.", "Douglas edited a literary journal, The Academy, from 1907 to 1910, during which time he had an affair with the artist Romaine Brooks, who was also bisexual. The main love of her life, Natalie Clifford Barney, also had an affair with Wilde's niece Dorothy and even, in 1901, with Douglas's future wife Olive Custance, the year before the couple married."]}, {"page": "Symbolism (arts)", "response": ["* Olive Custance (1874\u20131944)"]}, {"page": "Natalie Clifford Barney", "response": ["Due in part to Jean Chalon's early biography of her, published in English as Portrait of a Seductress, Barney had become more widely known for her many relationships than for her writing or her salon.\"I would be asked at dinner parties what I was working on and, replying, 'Natalie Clifford Barney,' I expected the usual post Jean Chalon response, 'What?

Colette was a demi-liaison, while the artist and furniture designer Eyre de Lanux, with whom she had an off-and-on affair for several years, was listed as an adventure.  Among the liaisons\u2014the relationships that she considered most important\u2014were Olive Custance, Ren\u00e9e Vivien, \u00c9lisabeth de Gramont, Romaine Brooks, and Dolly Wilde.Schenkar, 156, and Rodriguez, 298, give slightly different accounts of this list. Of these, the three longest relationships were with de Gramont, Brooks, and Wilde; from 1927, she was involved with all three of them simultaneously, a situation that ended only with Wilde's death.
