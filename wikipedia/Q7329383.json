Thomas Talbot and Sir John Talbot were his younger brothers.He was elected as the MP for Dublin County in the Parliament of Ireland in May 1790, sitting until March 1791 when it was ruled that he had not been duly elected.He was returned to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as one of two representatives for County Dublin in 1807, a seat he held until 1830. In 1834 he succeeded his mother in the barony. This was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. In 1836 he was sworn of the Irish Privy Council. Three years later he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Furnival, of Malahide in the County of Dublin, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords.\nLord Talbot of Malahide died in October 1849. He had no surviving male issue and the barony of Furnival died with him. He was succeeded in the Irish barony by his younger brother, James.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
