He was criticised by fellow panellist Dreda Say Mitchell for focusing on \"black culture\", since \"Black communities are not homogenous. So there are black cultures. Lots of different black cultures\". The then-leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, spoke about Starkey's remarks, saying that \"they are racist comments, frankly\". The author Toby Young, blogging in the Telegraph, defended Starkey by claiming that Starkey had been talking not about black culture in general. The Spectator columnist Rod Liddle argued in support of the remarks. Jones described the comments as \"one of the ugliest episodes of the backlash\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Starkey argued his views had been distorted, he referred only to a \"particular sort\" of \"black culture\", and that the \"black educationalists\" Tony Sewell and Katharine Birbalsingh supported the substance of his Newsnight comments."]}, {"page": "Roger Scruton", "response": ["Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan called Scruton \"the greatest conservative of our age\", adding: \"The country has lost a towering intellect.

The scholar and former politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali described him as a \"dear and generous friend, who gave freely to those who sought advice and wisdom, and he expected little in return\". Another friend and colleague, Douglas Murray, paid tribute to Scruton's personal kindness, calling him \"one of the kindest, most encouraging, thoughtful, and generous people you could ever have known\".

Author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez noted in the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds that the lines portray the second theme prevalent in Madonna's work alongside sex, that of romantic love. The singer relegates love as savior in the lyrics when she belts \"I believe in the power of love / I believe that you can rescue me\". It references the 1967 songs, \"Stop Her on Sight (S.O.S.)\" by Edwin Starr and \"Respect\" by Aretha Franklin. According to Katharine Birbalsingh from The Daily Telegraph, the confessional lyrics found Madonna reaching out directly to the listener, \"pleading for the love and attention\" needed through the lines like \"You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak / You see that I am silly, and pretentious and a freak\" before it turned to an affirmation of her grit."]}, {"page": "Black conservatism", "response": ["Other notable black conservatives in the United Kingdom include education reformer and writer Katharine Birbalsingh, who described her views as being \"small c conservative \u2013 a social conservative\", according to BBC News, and commentators Calvin Robinson and Inaya Folarin Iman.", "* Katharine Birbalsingh"]}, {"page": "To Sir, With Love (novel)", "response": ["The novel has been compared with the 2011 novel To Miss With Love by Katharine Birbalsingh."]}, {"page": "The Daily Telegraph", "response": ["* Katharine Birbalsingh, columnist"]}, {"page": "Dunraven School", "response": ["* Katharine Birbalsingh, former assistant headteacher"]}, {"page": "Michaela Community School", "response": ["Michaela Community School (simply referred to as MCS or Michaela) is an 11\u201318 mixed, free secondary school and sixth form in Wembley, Greater London, England.
