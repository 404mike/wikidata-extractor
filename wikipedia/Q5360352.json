One was John \"Jack\" Casey\u2014tall and stick-thin, with a bony face and a stammering  delivery\u2014who originally appeared as \"Bretton Woods\" (named after the location of the famous 1944 United Nations monetary and financial Conference), and only later redubbed as \"Eli\"  Woods (often \"Our Eli\"). The other stooge, 'Hutton Conyers' would be played either by members of the Casey family - including, on occasion, James Casey - or (from 1956 to 1959) by Roy Castle. Much later, Woods was in the support cast of Castles in the Air, a comedy series on BBC Radio 2.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, Woods featured in two Eddie Braben scripted comedy shows: The Show With Ten Legs (26 episodes, 1978\u201380) and The Show with No Name (13 episodes, 1982\u201384). Both shows harked back to the music hall tradition. As a performer, Woods turned his lifelong stutter to his advantage, using it to comic effect in many contexts. For many years active as a stage and radio performer, Woods also appeared in a number of television comedies, as well as playing small parts in a variety of films including A Private Function released in 1984.Although Woods's birth name was John Casey, he was better known to his family as Jack. He died at home in Stockton-on-Tees in the early hours of Thursday 1 May 2014, aged 91.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alison Steadman", "response": ["On radio, Steadman's talent for mimicry and character voices was given full rein in shows such as Week Ending, Castle's on the Air and The Worst Show on the Wireless, in both the latter of which she played the over-protective mother to Eli Woods' long-suffering Bunty/Precious. From 1982 to 1984, she joined Eli Woods and Eddie Braben (Morecambe and Wise's scriptwriter) in the UK radio show The Show with No Name for thirteen episodes, in what can be described as an updated version of Round the Horne comedy sketch show. Later, from 2002, she starred as Mrs Naughtie in the series Hamish and Dougal. Steadman had a spell in Roy Hudd's long running comedy show The News Huddlines in the early to mid 1980s. In December 2009, she starred in the late Mike Stott's My Mad Grandad on BBC Radio 4.\"My Mad Grandad\", BBC, 28 December 2009 From 2012 she played \"Ginny Fox\", a parody of Virginia Woolf, in the sitcom Gloomsbury.

James junior quickly discovered a greater talent for writing the sketches. So when his father moved into radio, James Casey ended up writing everything, including editions showcasing other comedians: for the radio series Northern Variety Parade, he wrote scripts not only for his father but also for popular comedians such as Norman Evans, for whom Casey wrote Over the Garden Wall style sketches. Jimmy James's radio broadcasts, written by his son, were in radio series such as The Mayor's Parlour and Home James; and, since each series pulled in huge audiences, Casey was offered a staff job as a BBC producer.", "A promising Des O'Connor radio series was ruined by the BBC reneging on the promise of a prime weekend timeslot; but Mike Yarwood and the young Morecambe and Wise also profited from Casey's witty scripts. He also worked closely with Eric and Ernie's eventual tv scriptwriter Eddie Braben (in the comedy sketch series The Worst Show on the Wireless \u2013 in which his son David Casey, and his cousin Eli Woods, also featured), produced Roy Castle on radio in Castle's on the Air (Roy Castle had begun his career, in the 1950s, as a member of Jimmy James and Co in the variety theatres), and he discovered and promoted a young Alison Steadman (also in The Worst Show on the Wireless).", "In 1982 he retired from the BBC, just before Ken Dodd could ask him to produce yet more radio shows. Upon retiring from radio, Casey revived his father's variety act to great acclaim with Roy Castle and Eli Woods, on The Michael Parkinson Show on BBC television in 1982. As a result of that appearance, they were invited to include the act in that year's Royal Variety Performance.
