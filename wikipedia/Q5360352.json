One was John \"Jack\" Casey\u2014tall and stick-thin, with a bony face and a stammering  delivery\u2014who originally appeared as \"Bretton Woods\" (named after the location of the famous 1944 United Nations monetary and financial Conference), and only later redubbed as \"Eli\"  Woods (often \"Our Eli\"). The other stooge, 'Hutton Conyers' would be played either by members of the Casey family - including, on occasion, James Casey - or (from 1956 to 1959) by Roy Castle. Much later, Woods was in the support cast of Castles in the Air, a comedy series on BBC Radio 2.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, Woods featured in two Eddie Braben scripted comedy shows: The Show With Ten Legs (26 episodes, 1978\u201380) and The Show with No Name (13 episodes, 1982\u201384). Both shows harked back to the music hall tradition. As a performer, Woods turned his lifelong stutter to his advantage, using it to comic effect in many contexts. For many years active as a stage and radio performer, Woods also appeared in a number of television comedies, as well as playing small parts in a variety of films including A Private Function released in 1984.Although Woods's birth name was John Casey, he was better known to his family as Jack. He died at home in Stockton-on-Tees in the early hours of Thursday 1 May 2014, aged 91.", "link_mentions": {}}}
