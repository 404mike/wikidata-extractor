Since the 19th century, two most prominent theories were of Bohemia, and the land of the Boykos in Eastern Galicia in the Carpathians. The latter was mostly argued by 19th-century scholars, like Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik (1795\u20131865) and Henry Hoyle Howorth (1842\u20131923), who also included the White Serbs among the Polabian Slavs. Rather than relating Boiki and Bohemia, which in turn derived from ethnonym of the Celtic tribe Boii, they related the toponym to the much younger ethnonym of the Rusyns sub-ethnic group Boykos. B\u00e9ni K\u00e1llay (1839\u20131903) noted that many historians assumed that Serbian territory was identical to the Czech lands (Bohemia) based on DAI's account and the name Bojka, but he also supported \u0160af\u00e1rik's thesis. Other scholars who had a similar opinion were Vladimir \u0106orovi\u0107 (1885\u20131941), and Ljubivoje Cerovi\u0107 (b. 1936).

They noted that the name was uncommon and probably not of Slavic origin. Slovak historian Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik compared the name to Purgas, which was the name of a Mordvins chief mentioned in 1229. Howorth considered that the Croats were subject to \"alien princes, perhaps of Avar descent\". Franjo Ra\u010dki considered that Porga could have been a foreign transcription of the Slavic name Borko.Franjo Ra\u010dki, Documenta historiae Croaticae periodum antiaquam illustrantia, p. 291 Vladimir Ma\u017eurani\u0107 noted that it was a genuine personal name which was attested in medieval Kingdom of Croatia at least since 12th as well Banate and Kingdom of Bosnia since 13th century in the form of Porug (Porugh de genere Boi\u0107, nobilis de Tetachich near terrae Mogorovich), Poruga, Por\u010da, Pur\u0107a / Pur\u010da, and Pur\u0111a (vir nobilis nomine Purthio quondam Streimiri).", "\u017divkovi\u0107 pointed out that Porga could not be Borna (r. 810\u2013821) or Branimir (879\u2013892), with whom the older generation of scholars have tried to identify him. The change of noble personal names, which shifted from Iranian (or another language of different origin) to Slavic, simply could not have happened in a mere few generations. As such, the time of the White Croat conquest of the Avars is estimated to be during the 7th, and not 9th, century. Missing the chronology, the early scholar Henry Hoyle Howorth believed that Porga was the son of one of the five brothers mentioned in chapter 30 who had left White Croatia. Working on that assumption, Croatian historian Ivo Omr\u010danin believed that Porga would have ruled in ca. 660\u2013680, while his father would have ruled ca. 635\u2013660. Serbian historian Tibor \u017divkovi\u0107 noted therefore that since the earliest possible date of Croat arrival would have been ca. 630, the baptism had to be before 638, while Heraclius was still on good terms with the pope. However, that would mean that the Croats had two archons at the time of Heraclius, and would rule for six or seven years, which is unlikely. \u017divkovi\u0107, based on De Administrando Imperio, thinks that the Croats' baptism is connected to Constans II (r. 641\u2013668), as the event that distinguishes the father of Porga (Heraclius I) from Porga (Heraclius Constantine)."]}, {"page": "Names of the Serbs and Serbia", "response": ["Some scholars argue that the Serb ethnonym is antique.
