He has been described by spiritualists as the most renowned psychic of the 20th century. Skeptics have pointed out a number of alleged frauds Flint perpetuated during his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Don't Look Now", "response": ["Roeg wanted Julie Christie to attend a s\u00e9ance prior to filming. Leslie Flint, a direct voice medium based in Notting Hill, invited them to attend a session which he was holding for some American parapsychologists, who were coming over to observe him.  Roeg and Christie went along and sat in a circle in the pitch dark and joined hands. Flint instructed his guests to \"uncross\" their legs, which Roeg subsequently incorporated into the film."]}, {"page": "Mediumship", "response": ["Direct voice communication is the claim that spirits speak independently of the medium, who facilitates the phenomenon rather than produces it. The role of the medium is to make the connection between the physical and spirit worlds. Trumpets are often utilised to amplify the signal, and directed voice mediums are sometimes known as \"trumpet mediums\". This form of mediumship also permits the medium to participate in the discourse during s\u00e9ances, since the medium's voice is not required by the spirit to communicate. Leslie Flint was one of the best known exponents of this form of mediumship.", "In 1970 two psychical researchers investigated the direct-voice medium Leslie Flint and found that all the \"spirit\" voices in his s\u00e9ance sounded exactly like himself and attributed his mediumship to \"second-rate ventriloquism\".M. Lamar Keene. (1997). The Psychic Mafia. Prometheus Books. p 122.  \"A medium still riding high in England is Leslie Flint, famed as an exponent of direct voice. William Rauscher and Allen Spraggett, who attended a sitting Flint held in 1970 in New York, said that it was the most abysmal flop of any seance they had endured. All the spirit voices sounded exactly like the medium and displayed an incredible ignorance of nearly everything pertaining to the sitters. The \"mediumship \" was second-rate ventriloquism.\" The medium Arthur Ford died leaving specific instructions that all of his files should be burned. In 1971 after his death, psychical researchers discovered his files but instead of burning them they were examined and discovered to be filled with obituaries, newspaper articles and other information, which enabled Ford to research his s\u00e9ance sitters backgrounds.Tim Madigan, David Goicoechea, Paul Kurtz.
