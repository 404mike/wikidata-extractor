Two more top-half finishes came in the following seasons, though a relatively weak 1980\u201381 season saw the dismissal of long-serving manager Ian McNeill shortly before the end of the season. They gained their first Football League promotion under the management of former Liverpool player Larry Lloyd in 1981\u201382, when a points tally of 91 saw them join the former Division Three for the first time, beginning a 10-year spell in English football's third tier. The club struggled in their first season in Division Three, which led to Lloyd's sacking in early 1983, at which point Bobby Charlton, a director at the time, took over as temporary manager before being replaced by Harry McNally. Under McNally's management, the club stabilised in Division Three and secured a pair of mid-table finishes, but a dreadful 1984\u201385 season cost him his job, with Tranmere manager Bryan Hamilton stepping into the breach. Under Hamilton's management, the club's performances went to the next level and they won their first silverware as a league club that season with the Freight Rover Trophy. They were beaten in the Northern final of the same competition the following season by Bolton Wanderers. More importantly, Hamilton achieved Division Three survival, which had looked an impossible task earlier that season.", "| Harry McNally"]}, {"page": "Chester City F.C.", "response": ["Thanks to the signing of players including Milton Graham, John Kelly and Stuart Rimmer, and astute management of Harry McNally, Chester returned to the Third Division in 1986. Three years later they narrowly missed out on a play-off spot as McNally worked miracles on a limited budget, but further bad times lay ahead. In 1990, Chester were moved out of their Sealand Road home and temporarily shared Macclesfield's Moss Rose ground. Despite regularly attracting tiny crowds, Chester defied the odds to avoid relegation from Division Three in both 1990\u201391 and 1991\u201392. They returned to the city, the new brand new Deva Stadium in 1992 in the renamed Division Two after a Football League restructure. The first competitive match at the Deva Stadium took place on 25 August 1992 against Stockport County, with the visitors running out 2\u20131 victors. The following Saturday saw the first League game at the new home of Chester City, which saw the Blues overcome Burnley 3\u20130. The Deva Stadium is notable for being right on the England\u2013Wales border: the pitch is in Wales, but the entrance and part of the club offices are in England.", "* Harry McNally (Jul 1985 \u2013 Oct 1992) "]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 in English football", "response": ["*12 December 2004: Harry McNally, 68, was a charismatic former manager of Wigan Athletic and Chester City.

The largest stand, known as the Red Insure (main) Stand, and The Harry McNally Terrace are both for home fans.

In summer 2007, Chester converted the South Stand from terracing to seating (as mentioned above). There have been few other changes of significance in the history of the Deva Stadium, although the North Terrace was renamed the Harry McNally Terrace in December 2006 in honour of one of its most popular managers (who died two years earlier).
