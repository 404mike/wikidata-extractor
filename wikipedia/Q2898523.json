He worked closely with such Liberal leaders as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill in designing social welfare projects, including the National Insurance Act 1911. During the First World War he played a central role in the main government propaganda agency.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Lloyd George", "response": ["As Liberal leader at last, Lloyd George used his fund to finance candidates and put forward innovative ideas for public works to reduce unemployment, detailed in works such as Britain's Industrial Future (known as the Yellow Book), and We Can Conquer Unemployment (known as the Orange Book). Charles Masterman, a member of the commission which prepared Britain's Industrial Future, wrote: \"When Lloyd George came back to the party, ideas came back to the party\". Lloyd George was helped by John Maynard Keynes to write We Can Conquer Unemployment, setting out economic policies to solve unemployment. In 1927, Lloyd George gave \u00a3300,000 and an annual grant of between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000 for the operations of the Liberal headquarters. He also gave \u00a32,000 per annum to the parliamentary party until 1931. Even with the money the results at the 1929 general election were disappointing. The Liberals increased their support only to 60 or so seats, while Labour became the largest party for the first time. Once again, the Liberals ended up supporting a minority Labour government. In 1929, Lloyd George became Father of the House (longest-serving member of the Commons), an honorific position without power."]}, {"page": "Love and Mr Lewisham", "response": ["Love and Mr Lewisham was well received, and Charles Masterman told Wells that he believed that along with Kipps, it was the novel most likely to endure.Smith (1986), p. 202. Sir Richard Gregory compared the novel to Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure.Smith (1986), p. 208."]}, {"page": "John Buchan", "response": ["Recognised for his abilities, Buchan was appointed as the Director of Information in 1917, under Lord Beaverbrook\u2014which Buchan said was \"the toughest job I ever took on\"\u2014and also assisted Charles Masterman in publishing a monthly magazine detailing the history of the war, the first edition appearing in February 1915 (and later published in 24 volumes as Nelson's History of the War). It was difficult for him, given his close connections to many of Britain's military leaders, to be critical of the British Army's conduct during the conflict. At Beaverbrook's request, Buchan met with journalist and neo-Jacobite Herbert Vivian and admitted to Vivian that he was a Jacobite sympathiser."]}, {"page": "H. H. Asquith", "response": ["In March 1923 a petition for reunion among Liberal backbenchers received 73 signatures, backed by the Lloyd Georgeite Daily Chronicle and the Asquithian Liberal Magazine. But reunion was opposed by senior Asquithian Liberals like Sir John Simon, Viscount Gladstone and Charles Masterman, and as late as 30 June by journalists such as H. W. Massingham and Gardiner of The Nation. Viscount Gladstone felt that \"it was generally recognised that Asquith was no longer effective as an active leader\" but that Lloyd George must not succeed him. By July Asquith was superficially friendly to Lloyd George and consulted him, but he did not include him in the Shadow Cabinet. Asquith wanted Lloyd George to make the first move but although the latter put out feelers to senior Asquith supporters he insisted that he was \"neither a suppliant nor a penitent\". M.S.R. Kinnear writes that Asquith felt that with Lloyd George's faction declining in strength he had everything to gain by waiting, while too quick an approach would antagonise the Labour leaders who hated Lloyd George and whose support he might need for a future Lib-Lab coalition. Kinnear also argues that Asquith's \"gloating\" over the defeat of Coalition Liberals in 1922 is evidence that \"the most important factor influencing Asquith against quick reunion was his personal dislike of Lloyd George and his desire for vengeance.\"", "The 1924 election was Asquith's last Parliamentary campaign, and there was no realistic chance of a return to the Commons. He told Charles Masterman \"I'd sooner go to hell than to Wales,\" the only part of the country where Liberal support remained strong. The King offered him a peerage (4 November 1924). Asquith felt he was not rich enough to accept, and would have preferred to die a commoner like Pitt or Gladstone. He accepted in January 1925 after a holiday in Egypt with his son Arthur. He deliberately chose the title \"Earl of Oxford\", saying it had a splendid history as the title chosen by Robert Harley, a Conservative statesman of Queen Anne's reign. He was thought by some to have delusions of grandeur, Lady Salisbury writing to him that the title was \"like a suburban villa calling itself Versailles.\" Asquith found the controversy amusing but the College of Heralds insisted that he add \"and Asquith\" to the final title, after protests from Harley's descendants. In practice he was known as \"Lord Oxford\". He never enjoyed the House of Lords, and thought the quality of debates there poor."]}, {"page": "Robert Bridges", "response": ["During the First World War, Bridges joined the group of writers assembled by Charles Masterman as part of Britain's War Propaganda Bureau at Wellington House."]}, {"page": "Psychological warfare", "response": ["In August 1914, David Lloyd George appointed a Member of Parliament (MP), Charles Masterman, to head a Propaganda Agency at Wellington House. A distinguished body of literary talent was enlisted for the task, with its members including Arthur Conan Doyle, Ford Madox Ford, G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over 1,160 pamphlets were published during the war and distributed to neutral countries, and eventually, to Germany. One of the first significant publications, the Report on Alleged German Outrages of 1915, had a great effect on general opinion across the world. The pamphlet documented atrocities, both actual and alleged, committed by the German army against Belgian civilians. A Dutch illustrator, Louis Raemaekers, provided the highly emotional drawings which appeared in the pamphlet."]}, {"page": "1914 in literature", "response": ["*September 2 \u2013 Charles Masterman invites 25 \"eminent literary men\" to Wellington House in London to form a secret British War Propaganda Bureau.

The British secretly set up the War Propaganda Bureau under MP Charles Masterman. Caine was one of twenty-five leading authors Masterman invited to the Bureau's London headquarters, Wellington House on 2 September 1914 with the purpose of best promoting Britain's interests during the war. Shortly after, Caine was one of fifty-three of the leading authors in Britain to sign the 'Authors' Declaration', a manifesto drafted by Masterman stating that Britain \"could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.\" Issued on 17 September the document was sent by special cable to the New York Times. Caine abandoned literary contracts in America valued at 150,000 dollars in order to devote all his energies to the British war effort."]}, {"page": "John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon", "response": ["Simon contemplated resigning in protest at the declaration of war in August 1914 but, in the end, changed his mind. He was accused of hypocrisy even though his position was not actually very different from that of Lloyd George. He remained in the Cabinet after Asquith reminded him of his public duty and hinted at promotion. He damaged himself in the eyes of Hobhouse (postmaster-general), Charles Masterman and the journalist C. P. Scott. Roy Jenkins believed that Simon was genuinely opposed to war.Jenkins 1999, p. 374."]}, {"page": "Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett", "response": ["Birkett's maiden speech in Parliament responded to a proposal by Charles Dukes,Hansard 1803\u20132005: House of Commons sitting of 20 February 1924, Mothers' Pensions a Labour Party Member of Parliament, in favour of state pensions for widows with children, and wives whose husbands were unable to work because of injury.Hyde (1965) p. 119. Birkett went further than the proposed change and suggested that pensions should be provided to unmarried mothers, deserted wives and divorced wives. His speech was well-received; the Nottingham Journal described it as making \"a most excellent impression\" on the House of Commons, and Charles Masterman called him \"a possible future Lord Chancellor\".Hyde (1965) p. 120. Because of his focus on his career as a barrister rather than as a politician, Birkett rarely appeared in the House of Commons, but he worked hard when he did attend. On one occasion, he spent all night in a Parliamentary session that ended at 6 a.m. and then attended a court session the next day."]}, {"page": "Reginald McKenna", "response": ["The problems of Ireland paled into insignificance in early August.
