Perry Groves, who played alongside Beattie at Colchester United, describes how Beattie, ostensibly playing at left-back, emerged to meet a cross from Kevin Keegan, beat two Scottish defenders and \"looped a great header\" into the goal, voted one of the top 50 goals England have scored. His final game for England was in October 1977 against Luxembourg in a qualification match for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. In total, he earned nine caps between 1975 and 1977, scoring once.", "Beattie was renowned for his strength, the nickname \"Beast\" reflecting that, but also his quality on the ball (with the resultant other nickname of \"Diamond\").

Whilst Nicholas could display extravagant skills, a lack of consistency restricted his impact. The arrival of George Graham as the new manager of Arsenal in the summer of 1986 saw Nicholas no longer have an automatic place in the team. Arsenal, however, did reach the League Cup final against Liverpool in April 1987. Liverpool's Ian Rush gave his side the lead on 23 minutes, but Nicholas equalised seven minutes later after a goal mouth scramble. In the second half, he appeared to be fouled in the penalty box by Gary Gillespie, but the referee ignored Arsenal's claims for a penalty. With seven minutes left, Nicholas received a cross from Perry Groves and shot at goal. The ball took a deflection off Ronnie Whelan, and went into the goal having deceived Bruce Grobbelaar. Arsenal held on to win 2\u20131. With this Wembley brace Nicholas thus became a club hero.", "In the summer of 1987, Celtic attempted to persuade Nicholas to return to Parkhead. However, he rejected his old club's offer, and decided to stay at Arsenal in the expectation he would remain part of their side. It proved to be a poor decision; Nicholas was dropped four games into the start of the 1987\u201388 season, in favour of Perry Groves as the strike-partner for new signing Alan Smith.
