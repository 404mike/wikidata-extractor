Hopwood's work, entitled The Laws of the Navy, set forth what might safely be termed the \"wisdom of the ages\" for all who seek to make their way in large, hierarchical organizations, with special emphasis on the seagoing versions. During the Great War era, Lieutenant Rowland Langmaid, R.N., made a series of drawings to accompany the poem, which was published in the version illustrated here. The writer Eeyore Smith in The Naval Review remarked \"that The Laws of the Navy has had a considerable influence upon the careers of many naval officers who have served during the last half century. The commonsense, the mild cynicism (\"there be those who have risen thereby\"), the jingling metre, accentuated by the illustrations of [Langmaid], have left their marks upon the memories of those who have come across the twin frames which hang upon the bulkheads and walls of ships and naval establishments.\""]}, {"page": "Rowland (given name)", "response": ["*Rowland Langmaid (1897\u20131956), British seaman"]}]}}
