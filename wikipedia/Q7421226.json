He was born at Kettering, Northamptonshire.\nMahmood was a right-handed lower-middle-order batsman and a right-arm leg-break, top spinner and googly bowler. Having played for Essex schools from childhood, Mahmood rose to eventually represent Essex 2nd XI in 1997 and 1998. He was famously targeted by Nasser Hussain, the then England Test team\u2019s vice-captain to train with England during the 1997 Ashes series to prepare against the threat of Shane Warne. Mahmood trained with the England team in Tests held at Edgbaston, Lords and The Oval. Mahmood was a prodigy of Joe Hussain, Nasser Hussain\u2019s father and was a graduate of Ilford Cricket School under Joe\u2019s guardianship.

The ensuing concussion went undetected by the medical staff at Somerset and Mahmood was forced to play whilst suffering from the side-effects of concussion. Mahmood unfortunately had to retire from the game due to this injury in 1999. \nHe returned to King\u2019s College, London to complete his undergraduate degree in Applied Computer Science and pursued a career working for internationally renowned consulting firms Deloitte Consulting and Capgemini Ernst & Young where he developed a specialism in Data Science, Six Sigma and Operational Excellence.
