He served as master of numerous White Star Line vessels. He was the captain of the RMS Titanic, and perished when the ship sank on its maiden voyage.\nRaised in a working environment, he left school early to join the merchant navy and the Royal Naval Reserve. After earning his master's ticket, he entered the service of the White Star Line, a prestigious British company. He quickly rose through the ranks and graduated in 1887. His first command was the SS Celtic. He served as commanding officer of numerous White Star Line vessels, including the Majestic (which he commanded for nine years) and attracted a strong and loyal following amongst passengers.\nIn 1904, Smith became the commodore of the White Star Line and was responsible for controlling its flagships. He successfully commanded the Baltic, Adriatic and the Olympic. In 1912, he was the captain of the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank on 15 April 1912; over 1,500 perished in the sinking, including Smith, who went down with the ship. For his stoicism and fortitude in the face of adversity, Smith became an icon of British \"stiff upper lip\" spirit and discipline.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 15", "response": ["**Edward Smith, English Captain (b. 1850)"]}, {"page": "January 27", "response": ["*  1850   \u2013 Edward Smith, English captain (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "1912", "response": ["** Edward Smith, English ship's captain (b. 1850)"]}, {"page": "1850", "response": ["** Edward Smith, British captain of the Titanic (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Campania", "response": ["The most well-known person in the Italian maritime industry is Neapolitan captain Francesco Schettino who crashed super-modern, full-equipped with all navigational and safety systems, cruise ship Costa Concordia on the underwater rocks of Giglio island in serene weather without any technical problem on board.
