While both the conventionally-bred and the engineered varieties exhibit altered expression of the same transcription factor of the MYB gene class which controls the anthocyanin biosynthesis, the engineered variety additionally produces the pigments in the flesh of the fruit rather than just the skin. This results in almost 100-fold higher concentration of anthocyanins in the engineered fruits compared to the conventional varieties.  The inventors of the GM blue tomato, Jonathan D. G. Jones and Cathie Martin of the John Innes Centre, founded a company called Norfolk Plant Sciences to commercialize the blue tomato. They partnered with a greenhouse farm in Canada to grow blue tomatoes from which to create new commercial products.John Innes Centre 25 January 2014 Press Release: Bumper harvest for GM purple tomatoes"]}, {"page": "Catherine Martin", "response": ["* Cathie Martin,  (born 1955) Professor of Plant Sciences at the University of East Anglia"]}, {"page": "Enrico Coen", "response": ["After a year (1983/4) he sought a different plant system to continue his research at John Innes Centre in Norwich which studied Antirrhinum, commonly known as snapdragon, and was hired together with colleague Cathie Martin to join the lab of Brian Harrison and Rosemary Carpenter.
