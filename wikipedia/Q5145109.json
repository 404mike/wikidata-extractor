Amongst other subsequent contributors, the letterpress printing was accomplished by Arthur (Art) Larson at Horton Tank Graphics, Daniel Kelleher at Wild Carrot Letterpress, Carol Blinn at Warwick Press and the Baskins' son Hosea Baskin, who printed Jewish Artists (1993) in Leeds. Arthur Larson also printed woodcuts, and Michael Kuch, etchings. The Oxbow Press (Roberta Bannister and Gail Alt), a photo-lithographic/offset printer, printed many of Gehenna's prospectuses and a few books as well, including The Gehenna Press: The Work of Fifty Years exhibition catalogue. Leonard Baskin continued to define the sensibility and typography and frequently the binding design of the books, as well as commissioning writers and illustrating the majority of the Press's works.           In 1992, Southern Methodist University's Bridwell Library and the Library of Congress mounted an exhibition to commemorate the Gehenna's half-century mark. Bibliographer and antiquarian bookseller Colin Franklin, along with Baskin and his son Hosea co-authored a bibliography of the Gehenna Press from 1942-1992, and Franklin also wrote a critical assessment. Oxbow Press published the book-length result: The Gehenna Press: The Work of Fifty Years, 1942\u20131992.
