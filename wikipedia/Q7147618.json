The estate had started some clearances, integral to their program of agricultural improvements. Whilst clearances in 1812 went reasonably smoothly, in 1813 Sellar failed to successfully negotiate with angry resistance in the Strath of Kildonan. A state of confrontation existed for more than six weeks and concessions ultimately had to be made by the estate to defuse the situation. In 1814, Sellar had the job of clearing some of the residents of Strathnaver. His actions here gave rise to a number of charges brought by the Sheriff-substitute Robert McKid, who was an enemy of Sellar's. The most serious of these was culpable homicide. Sellar was acquitted at his trial in April 1816, but has remained as the focus for much of the anger and indignation arising from the clearances. Sellar and Young were replaced by a new factor later in 1817, and Sutherland estate continued with even larger clearances, particularly in 1818-1820.\nSellar remained on the Sutherland estate as a tenant sheep farmer, becoming successful and well respected by others in the sheep and wool sector. In 1838 Sellar bought a sheep farm at Morvern in Argyll, thereby becoming a landowner.\nSellar was keen to express his opinions on the management of the Highlands, writing highly emphatic letters on the subject. He never deviated from his view that the Highland clearances were the correct course of action. As a lawyer he had had a very confrontational manner, clearly enjoying dispute and, by his own admission, being too willing to break someone in the courts. His precise view of the law is, in the eyes of some historians, his most believable defence against the charges on which he was tried - that he would always follow the process of law precisely.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Young Sellar", "response": ["Sellar was born at Morvich in Sutherland the son of Patrick Sellar of Westfield, Morayshire and his wife Anne Craig of Barmakelty, Moray.

Graduating with a first-class in classics, he was elected fellow of Oriel, and, after holding assistant professorships at Durham, Glasgow and St Andrews, was appointed professor of Greek at St Andrews (1857).

They provided an extra level of ambition for the estate.  New industries were added to the plans, to employ the resettled population. A coal mine was sunk at Brora, and fishing villages were built to exploit the herring shoals off the coast. Other ideas were tanning, flax, salt and brick manufacturing.

A 20-mile round trip on foot would not be unusual. Duties had to be performed in all weathers - when Patrick Sellar went to collect rents and issue eviction notices in the winter of 1813\u201314, one of his guides lost several toes to frostbite in the severe conditions. Alcoholism could be the result of the isolation that a Highland factor endured, together with the unrelenting hard work. The physical and mental health of many brought an early end to their careers. However, the job was well paid, with a typical salary being \u00a3200 per annum in the middle of the 19th century, with some earning twice that amount. In addition most factors would be provided with a house and a home farm to run for their own profit (thereby giving an example of the latest agricultural methods to the tenants).", "The opinions of factors on their work are available from a few published accounts. In the main era of clearance, Patrick Sellar emphatically made the case for the changes made under him and on other estates - an opinion from which he never deviated. He felt that his own family had benefited from the clearance of his grandfather (who had been a stonemason), starting the Sellars on a path of upward mobility. In a later generation of factors, Evander McIver steadfastedly criticised the existence of overcrowded crofting communities that had been created in the first phase of the clearances. He believed that the economic system was flawed, with neither the estate nor the crofters able to make a decent income from the resources available. This was a widely held view among post-clearance factors, so explaining their support of emigration programs from the congested districts."]}, {"page": "George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland", "response": ["The first of the new wave of clearances involved relocations from Assynt to coastal villages with the plan that farmers could take up fishing. The next eviction, in the Strath of Kildonan in 1813, was met with opposition and a 6 week long confrontation that was resolved by calling out the army and the estate making some concessions to those who were evicted. In 1814, one of the estate's factors, Patrick Sellar, was supervising clearances in Strathnaver when the roof timbers of a house were set on fire (to prevent the house being reoccupied after the eviction) with, allegedly, an elderly and bedridden woman still inside. The woman was rescued, but died 6 days later. The local law officer, Robert Mackid, was an enemy of Sellar and started taking witness statements so that Sellar could be prosecuted. The case went to trial in 1816 and Sellar was acquitted. The publicity arising from the trial was not welcome to the Sutherlands. Sellar was replaced as factor and further, larger clearances continued in 1818 to 1820. Despite efforts to avoid press comment, in 1819 The Observer newspaper ran the headline: \"the Devastation of Sutherland\", reporting the burning of roof timbers of large numbers of houses cleared at the same time."]}, {"page": "Strathnaver", "response": ["The first clearances in Strathnaver involved only 28 families (an estimated 140 people). Eviction notices were given in December 1813 by Patrick Sellar, the estate factor. The notices took effect on Whitsun 1814. Events were complicated by two things. Firstly Sellar had successfully bid for the lease of the sheep farm that the clearance would create. Secondly, the laying out of the land for the new crofts had been seriously delayed - displaced tenants had little time to prepare for their removal. Nevertheless, some departed before the appointed day, whilst others waited for the eviction party's arrival.", "The result of this clearance activity was the transformation of the strath from traditional semi-subsistence agriculture to sheep farming. In later years, the Highland Clearances were re-examined, notably by the Napier Commission, who published their report in 1884. One outcome of this was the creation of the Congested Districts Board (CDB) in 1897, tasked with alleviating the problems of the over-crowded crofting communities created by clearance. This coincided with Patrick Sellar's grandson deciding not to continue with the tenancy in Strathnaver. After protracted negotiations, the CDB were able to buy North Syre in 1901 and lay it out into 29 substantial crofts, creating the present-day landscape."]}, {"page": "The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil", "response": ["The sudden expansion of English and Scottish capital and estate enlargement \u2013 \"more money to buy more land\" \u2013 at the beginning of the 19th century is outlined next.

Associated with this was the suggestion by some theorists that the Celtic population were less hardworking than those of Anglo-Saxon stock (i.e. Lowlanders and, in some instances, English), so giving an economic element to a racial theory.

These views were held by people like Patrick Sellar, the factor employed by the Countess of Sutherland to put her plans into effect, who often wrote of his support for these ideas, and Sir Charles Trevelyan, the senior government representative in organising famine relief during the Highland Potato Famine.
