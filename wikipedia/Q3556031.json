She attended the Thetford Girls' School and later the High Wycombe College of Art and Technology, where she studied art and participated in college amateur productions. In her mid-twenties, Carlson played a few minor parts in films and television programmes.\nJames Carreras, the head of Hammer Films, saw one of her photographs in a newspaper and offered her a role opposite Christopher Lee in Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968). She starred in two further Hammer Horror films, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) and The Horror of Frankenstein (1970). She also appeared in the Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) episode \"The Ghost Who Saved the Bank at Monte Carlo\" in 1969 and an episode of The Saint (\"The Man who Gambled with Life\") with Roger Moore and also an episode of Department S (\"The Double Death of Charlie Crippen\").\nCarlson was one of the 4 main characters in the TV thriller series, Spyder's Web (1972), along with Anthony Ainley, Roger Lloyd-Pack, and Patricia Cutts. She had a small role in a 1975 episode of Public Eye playing Ingrid, the German girlfriend of Knaggs, a wanted bankrobber/gangster, played by Ray Lonnen. \nCarlson went into semi-retirement after marrying and moving to the United States. She now lives in South Carolina with her husband and three children and is a professional painter.\nCarlson emerged from a 24 year retirement to star in the 2019 film House of the Gorgon alongside fellow Hammer film stars Caroline Munro, Martine Beswick, and Christopher Neame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1944", "response": ["** Veronica Carlson, English actress and model"]}, {"page": "Peter Cushing", "response": ["The Curse of Frankenstein was an overnight success, bringing both Cushing and Lee worldwide fame.Burton, Tim (2006).

Cushing reprised the role of Baron Victor Frankenstein in five sequels. In the first, The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), his protagonist is sentenced to death by guillotine, but he flees and hides under the alias Doctor Victor Stein.

Cushing played the lead role twice more in Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974). The former film portrays Frankenstein as a far more ruthless character than had been seen before, and features a scene in which Cushing's Frankenstein rapes the character played by Veronica Carlson. Neither Carlson nor Cushing wanted to do the scene, filmed despite director Terence Fisher's objections, and the controversial sequence was edited out of the film for its American release.Carlson, Veronica (actor).

Cushing envisioned the character as an idealist warrior for the greater good, and studied the original book carefully and adapted several of Van Helsing's characteristics from the books into his performance, including the repeated gesture of raising his index finger to emphasise an important point.Leggett, p. 49 Cushing said one of the biggest challenges during filming was not missing whenever he struck a prop stake with a mallet and drove it into a vampire's heart.Cushing, p. 147 Dracula was released in 1958, with Cushing once again starring opposite Lee, who played the title character, although Cushing was given top billing.Meikle, p. 55 During filming, Cushing himself suggested the staging for the final confrontation scene, in which Van Helsing leaps onto a large library table, opens window curtains to weaken Dracula with sunlight, then uses two candlesticks as a makeshift crucifix to drive the vampire into the sunlight. As with the Frankenstein film, critics largely disliked Dracula because of its violence and sexual content, deeming it inferior to the 1931 Universal version.Lee, Christopher (actor).
