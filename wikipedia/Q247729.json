See for example Thomas Asbridge, The First Crusade: A New History (Oxford: 2004); Christopher Tyerman, God's War: A New History of the Crusades (Penguin: 2006); Jonathan Riley-Smith, The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading (Pennsylvania: 1991); and the lively but outdated Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades: Volume 1, The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (Cambridge: 1953). On 22 July, a council was held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to establish a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond IV of Toulouse and Godfrey of Bouillon were recognized as the leaders of the crusade and the siege of Jerusalem. Raymond was the wealthier and more powerful of the two, but at first he refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety and probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway.. The more popular Godfrey did not hesitate like Raymond, and accepted a position as secular leader. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (\"advocate\" or \"defender\" of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is used only in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term princeps, or simply retained his title of dux from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey had become a legendary hero, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\".William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea, trans. E.A. Babcock and A.C. Krey, Columbia University Press, 1943, vol. 1, bk. 9, ch. 9.

The new kingdom, and Godfrey's reputation, was secured with the defeat of the Fatimid Egyptian army under al-Afdal Shahanshah at the Battle of Ascalon one month after the conquest, on August 12, but Raymond and Godfrey's continued antagonism prevented the crusaders from taking control of Ascalon itself.Asbridge, pg. 326.", "As Hans Mayer says, \"the Muslim inhabitants of the Latin Kingdom hardly ever appear in the Latin chronicles\", so information on their role in society is difficult to find. The crusaders \"had a natural tendency to ignore these matters as simply without interest and certainly not worthy of record.\"Hans Mayer, \"Latins, Muslims, and Greeks in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem\", History 63 (1978), pg. 175; reprinted in Probleme des lateinischen K\u00f6nigreichs Jerusalem (Variorum, 1983). Although Muslims, as well as Jews and Eastern Christians, had virtually no rights in the countryside, where they were essentially the property of the crusader lord who owned the land,Mayer calls them \"chattels of the state\"; Hans Mayer, \"Latins, Muslims, and Greeks in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem\", History 63 (1978), pg. 177; reprinted in Probleme des lateinischen K\u00f6nigreichs Jerusalem (Variorum, 1983). tolerance for other faiths was in general no higher or lower than that found elsewhere in the Middle East. Greeks, Syriacs, and Jews continued to live as they had before, subject to their own laws and courts, with their former Muslim overlords simply replaced by the crusaders; Muslims now joined them at the lowest level of society. The ra'is, the leader of a Muslim or Syriac community, was a kind of vassal to whatever noble owned his land, but as the crusader nobles were absentee landlords the ra'is and their communities had a high degree of autonomy.Prawer, Crusader Institutions, pg. 207; Jonathan Riley-Smith, \"Some lesser officials in Latin Syria\" (English Historical Review, vol. 87, no. 342 (Jan., 1972)), pp. 1\u201315.", "An unknown number of Muslim slaves lived in the Kingdom. There was a very large slave market in Acre that functioned throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Italian merchants were sometimes accused of selling Southeastern European Christians as slaves along with Muslim slaves.Jonathan Riley-Smith, The Feudal Nobility, pp. 62\u201363. Slavery was less common than ransom, especially for prisoners of war; the large numbers of prisoners taken during raids and battles every year ensured that ransom money flowed freely between the Christian and Muslim states.Yvonne Friedman, Encounter between Enemies: Captivity and Ransom in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. Brill, 2002, throughout. Escape for prisoners and slaves was probably not difficult, as the inhabitants of the countryside were majority Muslim, and fugitive slaves were always a problem.

During his short reign, Godfrey had to defend the new Kingdom of Jerusalem against the Fatimids of Egypt, who were defeated at the Battle of Ascalon in August. He also faced opposition from Dagobert of Pisa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who was allied with Tancred. Although the Latins came close to capturing Ascalon, Godfrey's attempts to prevent Raymond of St. Gilles from securing the city for himself meant that the town remained in Muslim hands, destined to be a thorn in the new kingdom's side for years to come."]}, {"page": "Walter Sans Avoir", "response": ["Walter Sans Avoir (in French Fr.

Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Michaud's influential narratives concentrated on topics of war, conquest, and settlement while France's colonial ambitions in the Levant were linked explicitly. Emmanuel Rey's  described Frankish settlements in the Levant as colonies where the offspring of mixed marriages adopted local traditions. The first American crusade historian, Dana Carleton Munro, described the care the Franks took to \u2018\u2019win the goodwill of the natives\u2019\u2019. Historians rejected this approach in the 20thcentury. R. C. Smail argued it identified an integrated society which did not exist to justify French colonialism. The new consensus was the society was segregated with limited social and cultural interchange. Focusing on evidence of social, legal, and political frameworks in Jerusalem, Joshua Prawer and Jonathan Riley-Smith presented the widely accepted view of a society that was predominantly urban, isolated from the indigenous peoples, with separate legal and religious systems. Prawer's 1972 work, The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem: European Colonialism in the Middle Ages, extended this analysis: the lack of integration was based on economics with the Franks' position depending on a subjugated, disenfranchised local population. The Franks' primary motivations were economic. Islamic historian Carole Hillenbrand argued that the Islamic population responded with resentment, suspicion, and rejection of the Franks. Recently this has been challenged by historians such as Ronnie Ellenblum using archaeological research, but no alternative model has been accepted. Christopher Tyerman points out this is not a return to older theories as the same sources are used and the archaeology is unprovable. Specialist Denys Pringle notes that it does not contradict the earlier view. Hans Eberhard Mayer had already advised that the number of Franks living in rural settlements should not be underestimated. These theories support the idea that the crusader states formed part of the wider expansion of Western Europe: driven by religious reform and growing  papal power. However, historians argue there was no vigorous church reform in the East or resulting persecution of Jews and heretics. Some consider regulations from the 1120 Council of Nablus as exceptional and Benjamin Z. Kedar believed they followed Byzantine, rather than western reformist, precedent. The debate has led historians like Claude Cahen, Jean Richard, and Christopher MacEvitt to argue the history of the crusader states is distinct from the crusades, allowing the application of other analytical techniques that place the crusader states in the context of Near Eastern politics. These ideas are still in the process of articulation by modern historians."]}, {"page": "Gifford Lectures", "response": ["*2006\u201307 Simon Conway Morris Darwin 's Compass: How Evolution Discovers the Song of Creation and Jonathan Riley-Smith The Crusades and Christianity"]}, {"page": "Krak des Chevaliers", "response": ["Between 1142 and 1144 Raymond\u00a0II, Count of Tripoli, granted property in the county to the order.

Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state, which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with Raymond\u00a0II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Further, Raymond\u00a0II could not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers.

This reflects the view of the Roman Catholic Church (including medieval contemporaries such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux) that every military campaign given Papal sanction is equally valid as a Crusade, regardless of its cause, justification or geographic location. This broad definition includes attacks on paganism and heresy such as the Albigensian Crusade; the Northern Crusades and the Hussite Wars; and wars for political or territorial advantage such as the Aragonese Crusade in Sicily, a Crusade declared by Pope InnocentIII against Markward of Anweiler in 1202; one against the Stedingers; several (declared by different popes) against Emperor FrederickII and his sons; two Crusades against opponents of King Henry\u00a0III of England and the Christian re-conquest of Iberia. ", "Jonathan Riley-Smith considers that much of the popular understanding of the crusades derives from the 19thcentury novels of Scott and the French histories by Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Michaud. Michaud became the most influential 19thcentury historian of the Crusades with his 1812 , its 1831 revision and 1829 companion Bibliotheque des croisades (\"library of the Crusades\"). He married allied admiration with supremacist triumphalism. His views provided support for the nascent European commercial and political colonialism of the time in the Near East to the point where the Outremer were \"Christian colonies\". It was a long lasting view: T. E. Lawrence reminded the French claiming at the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference that \"the Crusaders had been defeated; the Crusades had failed\" In 1917, Louis Madelin described a benevolent Franco-Syrian society in Outremer, that was an attractive idea during the French mandates in Syria and Lebanon. Rene Grousset's 1934 to 1936  described  (\"France in the Levant\"). In 1953 Jean Richard described the kingdom of Jerusalem as \"the first attempt by Franks of the West to found colonies\".", "Claude Cahen in 1940's  (\"Northern Syria at the time of the Crusades\") established the study of the Latin settlements as features of Near Eastern history detached from the West. However, Hans Eberhard Mayer in 1965's Geschichte der Kreuzzuge (\"history of the Crusades\") questioned the definition of crusading. Jonathan Riley-Smith straddles the two schools on the actions and motives of early crusaders.  The definition of the crusade remains contentious. Riley-Smith's view that \"everyone accepted that the crusades to the East were the most prestigious and provided the scale against which the others were measured\" is largely accepted. There is disagreement whether it is only those campaigns launched to recover or protect Jerusalem that are proper crusades e.g. Mayer and Jean Flori. or whether all those wars to which popes applied equivalent temporal and spiritual were equally legitimate e.g. Riley-Smith and Norman Housley. These arguments do not place what was only a coherent paradigm around 1200 in the context of Medieval Christian holy war, as argued by John Gilchrist that Crusading was result an ecclesiastical initiative but a submission by the church to secular militarism and militancy completed only in the early 13thcentury. Today, Crusade historians study the Baltic, the Mediterranean, the Near East, even the Atlantic, and crusading's position in, and derivation, from host and victim societies. Chronological horizons have crusades existing into the early modern world e.g. the survival of the Order of St. John on Malta until 1798."]}, {"page": "Battle of Svolder", "response": ["* Sawyer, Peter (2005). \"Scandinavia in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries.\" In The New Cambridge Medieval History IV.
