Although four, Joe Ledley, Darcy Blake, Curtis McDonald and Joe Jacobson, had all been with the club prior to the academy's founding and one, Cameron Jerome, had been released by another team before signing for Cardiff. Lee Robinson was appointed as Kerr's replacement in June 2006. During the 2006\u201307 season, two further graduates of the academy, Chris Gunter and Aaron Ramsey, both made their professional debuts. In making his debut, Ramsey became the youngest player in the club's history to feature for the senior side at 16 years and 124 days. Robinson was credited as being a key figure in Ramsey's decision to reject interest from other clubs by local media, but left Cardiff suddenly in 2007 with the club refusing to elaborate on the decision.", " Curtis McDonald"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["|30||Curtis McDonald||LM||||Cardiff||||2||2||Academy||1 June 2006||Trainee||2007"]}, {"page": "List of Forest Green Rovers F.C. seasons", "response": ["Curtis McDonald"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Newport County A.F.C. season", "response": ["In the FA Cup, County were drawn away in the first round to Conference North qualifiers Brackley Town.
