She then competed in two more $25k events in March (reaching the quarterfinals of one) before heading to Bulgaria to compete in the Fed Cup for Britain. She played two singles matches (winning one) and four doubles matches (winning two). Following this, she reached two consecutive $25k semifinals in Incheon and Gimcheon, one as a qualifier and the other as a lucky loser.

Following this, she reached the final round of qualifying for the US Open before going on to win the $75k in Shrewsbury. She beat fellow Brit, Katie O'Brien, in the final. This result was enough to put both finalists into the top 100 for the first time in each of their careers. After this, Baltacha reached the semifinals of one more $50k, the second round of a $100k (where she had to withdraw due to food poisoning) and the quarterfinals of a $75k tournament.
