He was thereafter colonial secretary of the British Honduras (Belize) (1887\u20131889), colonial secretary (1889\u20131893) and lieutenant-governor of Mauritius (1892\u20131893), and governor of Trinidad and Tobago (1897\u20131900). The principal building, erected as his stately home, at great cost, incorporated the very latest innovations including a hydraulic lift and gas lighting to all parts of the main house. The portico is said to have been built for a visit of the Prince of Wales to make sure he did not get wet when alighting from his coach. When it was completed it was one of the largest private houses in the north of Northumberland, and Jerningham lived there until his death in 1914. Lady Jerningham (d. 1902) had been Annie, daughter of E. Liddell, of Benton Park, and widow of C. T. Mather of Longridge, and her statue sits on the Elizabethan town walls in Berwick-upon-Tweed looking towards the distant school. The building was afterwards a hotel, until it became a convent school."]}, {"page": "Index of Trinidad and Tobago\u2013related articles", "response": ["*Hubert Jerningham"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|Hubert Jerningham"]}, {"page": "Jerningham", "response": ["*Hubert Jerningham, KCMG, DL (1842\u20131914), British Liberal Party politician and Governor of Trinidad and Tobago 1897\u20131900"]}, {"page": "Sir Hubert Edward Henry Jerningham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hubert Jerningham"]}, {"page": "1881 Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election", "response": ["In 1881, Dudley Marjoribanks, MP, was elevated to the peerage as Baron Tweedmouth.

Biggart argued that requiring him to travel to Trinidad put an unfair burden on him because of the cost, especially since he had applied to take the examination in Tobago in 1900. The administration of Governor Hubert Jerningham had promised \"reasonable considerations\" for the inhabitants of Tobago when it became a ward, and Biggart argued that he should either be granted an exemption from the licensing requirement, or he should be given the opportunity to take the examination in Tobago. The medical board decided to allow Biggart to take the examination in Tobago, but that in doing so said they were not setting a precedent. "]}]}}
