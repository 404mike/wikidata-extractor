The campaign opened with Belgium at the Heysel Stadium, and though Ireland contained danger man Nico Claesen, they had to settle for a 2\u20132 draw after conceding twice from corner-kicks; Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady scored the goals for Ireland. They then dominated Scotland at Lansdowne Road, but failed to find the net and instead drew 0\u20130. In the return fixture at Hampden Park Mark Lawrenson scored an early goal and another clean sheet won the Irish their first win of qualification. The campaign faltered with a 2\u20131 loss in Bulgaria, though Charlton was furious with referee Carlos Silva Valente as he felt that both of Lachezar Tanev's goals should not have counted as Nasko Sirakov allegedly pushed Mick McCarthy in the build-up to the first and he felt that Sirakov was outside the penalty box when he was fouled by Kevin Moran \u2013 Valente instead gave a penalty. They picked up another point after a 0\u20130 draw with Belgium in Dublin. Despite not particularly impressing, Ireland then picked up six points with two victories over Luxembourg. They ended the campaign with a 2\u20130 home win over Bulgaria, Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran the scorers, though Liam Brady (an ever-present in qualification) picked up a two match suspension after lashing out late in the game after being repeatedly kicked by Bulgarian midfielder Ayan Sadakov. Despite the victory the Irish had to rely on a favour from the Scots in order to qualify, who duly obliged with a 1\u20130 victory, courtesy of Gary Mackay \u2013 a substitute earning his first cap \u2013 in Sofia to keep Bulgaria one point behind Ireland in the table."]}, {"page": "Heart of Midlothian F.C.", "response": ["*Most appearances: Gary Mackay, 640 (515 L, 58 SC, 46 LC, 21 E) 1980\u00a0\u2013 1997Appearances (Retrieved 19:21, 25 November 2006 (UTC))", "*Most league appearances: Gary Mackay, 515"]}, {"page": "Republic of Ireland national football team", "response": ["Ireland's first appearance at a major finals tournament came in Euro 1988.

Hibs equalised before half time and came close to taking the lead. Hearts replaced the tiring John Robertson with Foster. With just four minutes remaining, Gary Mackay played a long ball over the top of the Hibs defence for Foster to run on for.
