The critic continued: \"This can have the opposite effect, of course, and Ransmayr has affectations that can be irritating. All the same, he is a marvelous writer, though, unlike most novelists, he writes more about sensations than feelings.\" Publishers Weekly wrote: \"Ably translated by Woods, this novel paints a convincing postapocalyptic world sent back into a nearly pre-civilized state. But Ransmayr (The Terrors of Ice and Darkness), though clearly probing the question of how Germany is to view itself in the wake of the Holocaust and WWII, never pulls his story out of his dark, expressionist atmospherics into the clear light of an answer.\""]}, {"page": "Gabriele Ullstein", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gabriele Annan"]}, {"page": "Lady Annan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gabriele Annan"]}, {"page": "Gaby Annan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gabriele Annan"]}]}}
