Many of the species she classified and identified as being placed into improper genera were found in Asian countries, especially in the isolated island of Borneo.\nElettariopsis smithiae, a species of ginger native to Malaysia and Thailand, is named in honour of her. In 2001, a genus titled Smithatris was named after her, the two species in the genus being Smithatris supraneanae and Smithatris myanmarensis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alpinia zerumbet", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Rosemary Margaret Smith"]}, {"page": "List of taxonomic authorities named Smith", "response": ["* Rosemary Margaret Smith (1933\u20132004), a Scottish botanist"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (Q\u2013R)", "response": ["* R.M.Sm. \u2013 Rosemary Margaret Smith (1933\u20132004) "]}, {"page": "Pleuranthodium", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Rosemary Margaret Smith"]}, {"page": "Stadiochilus", "response": ["Stadiochilus is a genus of plants in the ginger family.
