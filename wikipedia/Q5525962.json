Gunmen at a paramilitary display in Portadown in 2000 told journalists: \"He [Wright] did what he had to do to ensure that our faith and culture were kept intact.\" Wright was also taken up as an inspiration by Johnny Adair and the UDA West Belfast Brigade. In the immediate aftermath of Wright's killing, Adair told his main gunmen Stephen McKeag and Gary Smyth that they had a free hand to \"avenge\" Wright's death, with McKeag almost immediately launching a machine gun attack on a bar in a mainly Catholic area despite the UDA being officially on ceasefire. The West Belfast Brigade would later reference Wright as a true loyalist who had been a victim of the UVF in a leaflet circulated to foment a feud between the UDA and the UVF. Despite this, the two men had had a fractured relationship during Wright's life and according to Adair's sometime girlfriend Jackie \"Legs\" Robinson, Adair had told her that Wright was a \"bastard\" when the UVF leader attended a party at Robinson's house. Robinson wrote the incident off as jealousy on Adair's part as Wright was already well established as a leading figure in loyalism by that stage whilst Adair was still making his name."]}, {"page": "Gary Smith", "response": ["*Gary Smyth (born 1969), Northern Irish footballer", "*Gary Smyth (loyalist), Northern Irish former loyalist paramilitary"]}, {"page": "Gary Smyth", "response": ["Gary Smyth (born 20 December 1969 in Belfast) is a Northern Irish former footballer and manager.
