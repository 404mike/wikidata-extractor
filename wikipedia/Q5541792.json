He started his career in football management with Burnley in March 1900, when he was hired as the club's second official manager following the departure of Harry Bradshaw almost a year earlier. The side were struggling when he joined the club, and with just one month of the 1899\u20131900 season remaining, relegation to the Second Division seemed almost inevitable. Their relegation was confirmed on 28 April 1900 after a 4-0 defeat away at Nottingham Forest. He signed three players, Henry Collins, Jimmy Lindsay and George Lockhart, in the close season. The team achieved a third-placed finish in their first season in the Second Division and finished ninth the following year. The team's fortunes suffered a swift decline in the 1902\u201303 season, and Burnley finished bottom of the Football League and were forced to apply for re-election. Burnley were re-elected and Mangnall started the next campaign as manager, but he left the club in October 1903 to join Second Division rivals Manchester United."]}, {"page": "George Lockhart", "response": ["George Lockhart may refer to:", "* Sir George Lockhart, Lord Carnwath (c. 1630\u20131689), Scottish lawyer and judge", "* George Lockhart (footballer) (1877\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "* George Lockhart (politician) (1673\u20131731), Scottish writer, politician and spy", "* George Lockhart of Tarbrax (died 1658), Commissioner for Glasgow in the Scottish Parliament", "* George Lockhart Rives"]}]}}
