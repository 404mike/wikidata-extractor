However, Ricardo \u2013 who set the pattern of modern textbooks \u2013 had a mind that was entirely unhistorical.\u201d  There were several advantages in combining economics and history according to Toynbee.  To begin with, it improved economic understanding.  \u201cWe see abstract propositions in a new light when studying them in relation to historical facts.  Propositions become more vivid and truthful.\u201d Meanwhile, studying history with economics makes history easier to understand.  Economics teaches us to look out for the right facts in reading history and makes matters such as introducing enclosures, machinery, or new currencies more intelligible.  Economics also teaches careful deductive reasoning.  \u201cThe habits of mind it instils are even more valuable than the knowledge of principles it gives.
