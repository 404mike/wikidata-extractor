F. D. Moule (1977), James Dunn (1980), Brian Hebblethwaite (1985) and David Brown (1985).Hick, John, The Metaphor of God Incarnate, page 27. \"A further point of broad agreement among New Testament scholars ... is that the historical Jesus did not make the claim to deity that later Christian thought was to make for him: he did not understand himself to be God, or God the Son, incarnate. ... such evidence as there is has led the historians of the period to conclude, with an impressive degree of unanimity, that Jesus did not claim to be God incarnate.\" Larry Hurtado, who argues that the followers of Jesus within a very short period developed an exceedingly high level of devotional reverence to Jesus, at the same time rejects the view that Jesus made a claim to messiahship or divinity to his disciples during his life as \"naive and ahistorical\". According to Gerd L\u00fcdemann, the broad consensus among modern New Testament scholars is that the proclamation of the divinity of Jesus was a development within the earliest Christian communities.Gerd L\u00fcdemann, \"An Embarrassing Misrepresentation\", Free Inquiry, October / November 2007. \"...\u00a0the broad consensus of modern New Testament scholars that the proclamation of Jesus's exalted nature was in large measure the creation of the earliest Christian communities.\" N.

But Andrew Loke argues that if Jesus did not claim and show himself to be truly divine and rise from the dead, the earliest Christian leaders who were devout ancient monotheistic Jews would have regarded Jesus as merely a teacher or a prophet, but not as truly divine, which they did.Andrew Ter Ern Loke, The Origin of Divine Christology (Cambridge University Press, 2017), pp. 100\u2013135"]}, {"page": "Gnosticism", "response": ["Tertullian calls Paul \"the apostle of the heretics\", because Paul's writings were attractive to gnostics, and interpreted in a gnostic way, while Jewish Christians found him to stray from the Jewish roots of Christianity.

Dunn states that Josephus positions John as a righteous preacher (dikaiosyne) who encourages his followers to practice \"righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God\" and that Mark 6:20 similarly calls John \"a righteous (dikaios) and holy man\". Dunn states that Antipas likely saw John as a figure whose ascetic lifestyle and calls for moral reform could provoke a popular uprising on moral grounds, as both Josephus and the New Testament suggest."]}, {"page": "Paul the Apostle", "response": ["Paul says that prior to his conversion,, ,  he persecuted early Christians \"beyond measure\", more specifically Hellenised diaspora Jewish members who had returned to the area of Jerusalem. According to James Dunn, the Jerusalem community consisted of \"Hebrews,\" Jews speaking both Aramaic and Greek, and \"Hellenists,\" Jews speaking only Greek, possibly diaspora Jews who had resettled in Jerusalem. Paul's initial persecution of Christians probably was directed against these Greek-speaking \"Hellenists\" due to their anti-Temple attitude. Within the early Jewish Christian community, this also set them apart from the \"Hebrews\" and their continuing participation in the Temple cult.", "Sanders' publications have since been taken up by Professor James Dunn who coined the phrase \"The New Perspective on Paul\". N.T. Wright, the Anglican Bishop of Durham, notes a difference in emphasis between Galatians and Romans, the latter being much more positive about the continuing covenant between God and his ancient people than the former. Wright also contends that performing Christian works is not insignificant but rather proof of having attained the redemption of Jesus Christ by grace (free gift received by faith). He concludes that Paul distinguishes between performing Christian works which are signs of ethnic identity and others which are a sign of obedience to Christ."]}, {"page": "Resurrection of Jesus", "response": ["James Dunn notes that there is a great difference between Paul's resurrection appearance, and the appearances described in the Gospels. Where \"Paul's seeing was visionary [...], 'from heaven',\" in contrast, the Gospel-accounts have a \"massive realism\" to them. Dunn contends that the \"massive realism' [...] of the [Gospel] appearances themselves can only be described as visionary with great difficulty \u2013 and Luke would certainly reject the description as inappropriate.\" According to Dunn, most scholars explain this as a \"legendary materialization\" of the visionary experiences, \"borrowing the traits of the earthly Jesus.\" Yet, according to Dunn, there was both \"a tendency away from the physical [...] and a reverse tendency towards the physical.\" The tendency towards the material is most clear, but there are also signs for the tendency away from the physical, and \"there are some indications that a more physical understanding was current in the earliest Jerusalem community.\"", "Easter (or Easter Sunday) is the preeminent Christian feast that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus, and, according to Susan J. White, \"is clearly the earliest Christian festival.\"Foundations of Christian Worship by Susan J. White 2006  p. 55 According to James Dunn, \"In Easter we celebrate man become God [...] that in the death and resurrection of Christ God has broken the stranglehold of human selfishness, has proved the enduring and conquering strength of divine love.\" According to Thorwald Lorenzen, the first Easter led to a shift in emphasis from faith \"in God\" to faith \"in Christ\".

Eerdmans Publishing, 1999. Pp.176-211 p 179. 'The challenge thus posed to Christian NT scholars in particular cannot therefore be ducked... The question we must face, then, is whether such attitudes are already inseparable from the scriptures on which they were based. ... in terms of the present inquiry, Does the attitude to Jews in the post-70 NT documents indicate that the final breach, the decisive parting of the ways between Christianity and (rabbinic) Judaism, has already happened?' According to Louis Feldman, the term \"antisemitism\" is an \"absurdity which the Jews took over from the Germans.\" He thinks the proper term is anti-Judaism.Louis Feldman, Studies in Hellenistic Judaism, BRILL 1996 pp.277f. and n.1:'Of course, the term antisemitism is an absurdity which the Jews took over from the Germans. There was no such thing in antiquity, since its basis, the Machic family tree, was hardly known outside the circles of the Jews themselves, until the rise of Christianity, which could not well be hostile to the race of its savior. The more accurate term would be \u201canti-Judaism\u201d but the term \u201canti-Semitism\u201d is so widespread that it may seem artificial to discard it.\u2019 The distinction between anti-Judaism and antisemitism is often made, or challenged,David Luckensmeyer, pp.167-171. with regard to early Christian hostility to Jews: some, notably Gavin I. Langmuir,Avner Falk, Anti-semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred, ABC-CLIO, 2008 pp.6-8 prefer anti-Judaism, which implies a theological enmity. They say that the concept of antisemitism \"makes little sense\" in the nascent days of the Christian religion and that it would not emerge until later.Guy G Strousma, \u2018From anti-Judaism to antisemitism in Early Christianity,\u2019 in Ora Limor, Guy Stroumsa, Contra Iudaeos: Ancient and Medieval Polemics Between Christians and Jews, Mohr Siebeck 1996 pp.1-26 p.5: 'It obviously makes little sense to speak of Christian anti-Semitism in the earliest stages of the new religion, since the belief in Jesus Christ was at first held within a Jewish sectarian movement . .Anti-Judaism is hence perceived as inherent to Christianity, while antisemitism would represent an attitude of a rather different nature, appearing later, and elsewhere In this context, the term antisemitism implies the secular biological race theories of modern times.Ruth Sheridan Retelling Scripture: 'The Jews' and the Scriptural Citations in John 1:19-12:15, BRILL, 2012 Rev.ed. pp.38 f. Sheridan argues the dichotomy is problematic Peter Sch\u00e4fer prefers the word Judaeophobia for pagan hostility to Jews, but considers the word antisemitism, even if anachronistic, synonymous with this term, while adding that Christian anti-Judaism eventually was crucial to what later became antisemitism.Peter Sch\u00e4fer,  Judeophobia: Attitudes Toward the Jews in the Ancient World, Harvard University Press 1997 pp.6-7, p:7, pp.197ff.\u2019The only term I avoid is \u201canti-Judaism\u201d thus following those scholars who restrict it to early Christian expressions of hostility towards the Jews.\u00ec James D. G. Dunn argues that the various New Testament expressions of anger and hurt by a minority puzzled by the refusal of a majority to accept their claims about Jesus the Jew reflect inner tensions between Jewish communities not yet unified by rabbinical Judaism, and a Christianity not yet detached from Judaism. The Greek word Ioudaioi used throughout the New Testament could refer either to Jews or, more restrictively, to Judeans alone."]}, {"page": "Ascension of Jesus", "response": ["In modern times, a literal reading of the Ascension-stories has become problematic, due to the differences between the pre-scientific cosmology of the times of Jesus, and the scientific worldview that leaves no place for a Heaven above earth.

Similarly, in the words of McGill University's Douglas Farrow, in modern times the Ascension is seen less as the climax of the mystery of Christ than as \"something of an embarrassment in the age of the telescope and the space probe,\" an \"idea [that] conjures up an outdated cosmology.\" "]}, {"page": "Historicity of Jesus", "response": ["According to New Testament scholar James Dunn, nearly all modern scholars consider the baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion to be historically certain.

Historical scholars see differences between the content of the Jewish Messianic prophecies and the life of Jesus, undermining views Jesus was invented as a Jewish Midrash or Peshar.
