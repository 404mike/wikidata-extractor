The army remained encamped outside Boulogne and the British were initially suspicious that his departure was a ruse, and that he would double back unexpectedly to take command of the army and launch the invasion. In the meantime the frigate HMS Immortalite was sent under the command of Captain Edward Owen to carry out surveys along the French coast around the port. Fulton subsequently pronounced his inventions ready, and an assault was planned for early October. Working at Portsmouth Dockyard Fulton had built several types of craft and explosive devices. The 'torpedo-catamaran' was a coffer-like device balanced on two wooden floats and steered by a man with a paddle. Weighted with lead so as to ride low in the water, the operator was further disguised by wearing dark clothes and a black cap. His task was to approach the French ship, hook the torpedo to the anchor cable and, having activated the device by removing a pin, remove the paddles and escape before the torpedo detonated. Also to be deployed were large numbers of casks filled with gunpowder, ballast and combustible balls. They would float in on the tide and on washing up against an enemy's hull, explode. Also included in the force were several fireships, carrying 40 barrels of gunpowder and rigged to explode by a clockwork mechanism."]}, {"page": "George Nicholas Hardinge", "response": ["Hardinge's earlier patron, Earl St Vincent, had by now risen to the post of First Lord of the Admiralty, and he promoted Hardinge to the rank of commander on 29 April 1802.

Serving in the English Channel, initially under Captain Edward Owen, and later Admiral James Saumarez, he took part in the attack on Granville. The Terror was heavily damaged in this operation, and Hardinge's next command was the 18-gun , which he commanded in the North Sea. On 28 March 1804 he was sailing off the Vlie when he discovered two Dutch brig-corvettes at anchor in the roads. Since the Scorpion was too large to risk navigating the passage, Hardinge decided to make an attack with his boats. While waiting for conditions that would allow an attack, he was joined by the 14-gun , and at 9.30 in the evening of 31 March two boats from Beaver and three from Scorpion altogether carrying 60 men, set off to attack the Dutch. They approached the nearest one, the Atalante and rushed her, Hardinge being the first to leap aboard. After some fierce fighting they subdued the Dutch crew, with Hardinge at one point fighting hand to hand with the Dutch captain. The Dutch captain was able to disarm Hardinge, but other members of the crew came to his aid. Seeing that his opponent was outnumbered Hardinge called upon the Dutch captain to surrender, but he refused and the British were forced to kill him. 'He fell covered with honourable wounds', as Hardinge later recounted. The British secured the Atalante, and attempted to attack the second Dutch ship, but found that she had moved out of range.

The British force broke off the fight at nightfall and Verhuell decided to anchor in the roadstead of Calais. During the night his chief-of-staff captain A.A.

The French shore batteries also took part in the duel. The combined fire of the Dutch schooners and French heavy artillery forced the British fleet to break off the fight after two hours. The flotilla suffered the loss of 11 gunboats, that had to enter the harbour of Calais. His flotilla thus reduced to 21 gun schooners, Verhuell decided to round Cap Gris-Nez, well aware that the British were waiting for him. Much against his better judgment, the French Marshal Davout joined him aboard the schooner Heemskerk, and around 3 PM Verhuell weighed anchor to proceed toward the Cape. He was now faced by a British squadron of two ships of the line, six frigates and thirteen brigs that neared him to often only the distance of a pistol shot. Two brigs attempted to board Heemskerk, but were repelled. The Batavian ships were from the shore supported by Davout's horse artillery, and the British ships mostly over-shot the low-lying Dutch vessels, so that the damage remained limited. Finally, Verhuell's flotilla managed to round the Cape, after which the British attack abated, though they followed the flotilla till it had safely reached Ambleteuse around 7 PM. The British then made a final attempt to sink the Dutch flotilla, lying at anchor below the shore batteries, by gunfire, but were driven off by the French heavy guns after an hour.de Jonge, pp.566-575While Verhuell was underway to Ambleteuse, the French admiral, Lacrosse, launched a diversionary action with ships from the Boulogne flotilla.
