He played for Durham, Lancashire and England as a right arm fast-medium bowler and a right-hand tail-end batsman. After a successful start to the 2009 cricket season, Onions was selected to face the West Indies in Test cricket, and following success in the series, was retained for the 2009 Ashes series. In April 2010, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named him as one of its five cricketers of the year for 2009. A back injury in March 2010 prevented Onions from playing cricket until 2011. He returned to competitive cricket that season, taking 50 wickets in the County Championship, and towards the end of the year was called up to England's Test squad. However, in September 2020, Onions announced his retirement from cricket after his back injury returned.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 9", "response": ["*  1982   \u2013 Graham Onions, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Durban", "response": ["Durban is host to the KwaZulu-Natal cricket team, who play as the Dolphins when competing in the Sunfoil Series.

He struck his highest first-class score that season, making 192 not out against Warwickshire.  He played 14 List A matches in 2007, scoring 345 runs with a high score of 75 not out.

His performances in the 2007 saw Carberry named as the Hampshire Cricket Society Player of the Year, as well as seeing him selected for the England Lions tour of India.  He played for the Marylebone Cricket Club in the Champion County match against Sussex at the beginning of the 2008 season, batting once in the match and scoring 8 runs before being dismissed by Ryan Harris.  His form dropped in 2008, with him scoring 815 first-class runs at average of 31.34, with a single century score of 108 (although this came for England Lions against the touring New Zealanders).

England won the toss and chose to bat first. They started exceptionally well with Strauss and Cook opening and going in for lunch 126/0. There was bad luck for the Australians after the interval when Strauss hit a ball back towards bowler Nathan Hauritz who, in trying to take the catch, dislocated his finger. England's pre-lunch form continued into the afternoon, until, with the score 196/0, Cook was dismissed LBW by Johnson just short of his century on 95. England soon lost Bopara for 18 and, from 222/2, England started to collapse: the next four middle order batsmen fell for just 74 with Australia's bowlers looking far better than they had done earlier in the day. Strauss continued past 150 to reach 161 with Broad on 7 going into day 2 and England on a possible shaky 364/6.", "England started the day in fine form as Graham Onions removed Shane Watson and Michael Hussey with the first two balls of the day, before taking the wicket of Ricky Ponting soon after as the Australian captain tried to hook a quick bouncer. The Australians only added another 30 runs before James Anderson took the next wicket, sparking a sequence of four Anderson wickets in four overs for just 10 runs. Anderson and Onions shared the last two wickets between them as Nathan Hauritz and Ben Hilfenhaus put on 34 for the tenth wicket. England opened their innings with the momentum in their favour, but they had to face the same batting conditions as the Australians had, and Alastair Cook was removed for a duck in the second over. Ravi Bopara was the next to fall as he continued his poor run of form and put on just 23 runs. However, Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell batted until the end of the day to take England into the third day at 116/2.", "Resuming with a 94 run lead Clarke and North extended their partnership to 152 runs before it was broken by Graham Onions. After the lunch break, North continued with good support from the Australian tail and reached his century with a six. Clark was the best of the others with three sixes in his score of 32 (22 deliveries), and Australia finished with a total of 445. Stuart Broad recorded his best Test effort with figures of six wickets for 91 runs. The English openers started comfortably in the quest to erase the 343 run deficit. But just as it seemed they were in control, Ben Hilfenhaus struck twice in two balls, first removing Strauss with a ball that swung in subtly and then Bopara was dismissed for leg before, despite replays showing a deft inside edge onto his pad. Johnson produced a spell of left arm swing bowling that captured the prime wickets of Bell (3), Collingwood (4) and opener Cook. Nightwatchman Anderson was left with Prior at stumps with England in trouble at 82/5, still 261 runs behind Australia's total."]}, {"page": "Low Fell", "response": ["Several of these villas remain today and contribute to the dozen Grade II listed buildings in the suburb, which has continued to develop into an affluent area with a village feel.
