It's bad writing and it lets the reader ignore the larger point Crichton is trying to make.\" In The Guardian, Peter Guttridge wrote that the charts and research in the book got \"in the way of the thriller elements\" and stated the bibliography was more interesting than the plot.

And, indeed, when Fforde wrote the first version of this novel in 1994 - he called it Who Killed Humpty Dumpty? - it was rejected by every publisher he sent it to. But I love it. The Big Over Easy is great not just because it's very funny (albeit with some excruciating puns) but also because it works properly as a whodunit. Although I was wrong to say Spratt is untroubled. As a conflation of three nursery rhyme Jacks, he has several 'issues' to deal with, including the need for a fat-free diet and a strong compulsion to kill giants.\" Guttridge concluded his review saying simply, \"Comic genius\"."]}, {"page": "The Treatment (novel)", "response": ["Peter Guttridge of The Observer described it as \"a bleak, powerful story of child abuse\".Peter Guttridge, \"You've got mail - from your dead wife\", The Observer, 28 July 2001, Retrieved 8 October 2013 Maxim Jakubowski of The Guardian said it was one of the best offerings of the month, and \"Books don't get any harsher about the rotten core of humanity\".Maxim Jakubowski, \"Big in crime\", The Guardian, 6 July 2001, Retrieved 8 October 2013 In 2002 it won the WH Smith Thumping Great Read Award.", "*Peter Guttridge, \"You've got mail - from your dead wife\", The Observer, 28 July 2001"]}, {"page": "Left Coast Crime", "response": ["* 2006: Cast Adrift by Peter Guttridge"]}, {"page": "Peter Guttridge (writer and critic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Guttridge"]}, {"page": "Eureka Street (novel)", "response": ["*Peter Guttridge writing in The Observer concludes \"Wilson has a pleasurably flexible, easy-going narrative style.
