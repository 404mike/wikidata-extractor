It was a Poetry Book Society Choice. The volume includes \u2018Handsworth Liberties\u2019, a sequence of sixteen poems written between 1974 and 1977. These poems recall images of the neighbourhood where he grew up. Fisher described the writing of these pieces as an attempt to \u2018repel the invasion of landscape\u2019 associated with childhood memories.Interview with Peter Robinson, 1977, excerpted in Interviews Through Time.", "In 1980 Oxford University Press published Poems 1955\u20131980, affording Fisher's work a level of recognition it had not previously enjoyed. Six years later OUP published A Furnace,  an ambitious book-length poem structured around the idea of a double spiral with a central section, \u2018Core\u2019, flanked by sections where passages move \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018out\u2019 from the core. An \u2018Introit\u2019 provides the background and context to the work.'They are all gone into the world,' a conversation with Peter Robinson published in Interviews Through Time. As with Fisher's other work, it is a collage of images, but here drawn from a wide range of places and historical periods. In 1980 Fisher travelled outside of Britain for the first time and A Furnace includes references to a prehistoric burial site in Brittany, to Paris, Trier, Chicago and to Ampurias in Spain. Bunting's Briggflatts is in some senses a model, though Fisher allows himself more space and the language is less compacted than in Bunting.", "In an interview with Peter Robinson given in 1998 Fisher questions the idea that his work has gone through distinct periods of development, and the collected poems The Long and the Short of It, published by Bloodaxe in 2005, does not present the poems in a chronological sequence. In a note at the end of the book Fisher says: \u2018my habits of working on projects from time to time over long periods and my heterodox approach to the methods I use would make an arrangement that seemed chronological false: so nothing of the kind is here attempted.\u2019The Long and the Short of It, Bloodaxe, 2005.", "Fisher attracted the attention of a diverse range of critics and reviewers over the years. Eric Mottram, writing in Stand (1969\u201370) praised Fisher as an experimental modernist,Eric Mottram, Stand, 1969\u201370. while Donald Davie, in a chapter devoted to Fisher in Thomas Hardy and British Poetry (1973), claimed affinities with what he considered a native tradition.Donald Davie, Thomas Hardy and British Poetry, Routledge & Keegan Paul, 1973. Peter Robinson has suggested that this kind of \u2018dualism of approach\u2019, with modernists and traditionalists both claiming Fisher as one of their own, has continued to the present.Peter Robinson, \u2018Introduction\u2019 in The Thing About Roy Fisher, ed. John Kerrigan and Peter Robinson, Liverpool University Press, 2000. Fisher himself never sought to associate with any particular camp or school, and his writing during all periods of his career embraces a range of styles. Critics as diverse as Andrew Crozier, Sean O\u2019Brien, and Marjorie Perloff have written in praise of Fisher, though from very different perspectives.", "News for the Ear: A Homage to Roy Fisher edited by Peter Robinson and Robert Sheppard appeared in 2000, as a tribute to the poet on his seventieth birthday. A volume of critical essays, The Thing About Roy Fisher, edited by John Kerrigan and Peter Robinson, was published the same year. A compendium of interviews with Fisher, Interviews Through Time, edited by Tony Fraser, also appeared in 2000, with an updated version issued in 2013.", "In 2010, An Unofficial Roy Fisher edited by Peter Robinson was published in celebration of the poet's eightieth birthday.
