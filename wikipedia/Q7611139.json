The tunnel is named after the local land owner, Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1729\u20131814), who refused to allow a deep cutting through his property and insisted on a tunnel. The tunnel has red brick portals, capped with Bath stone, each with a decorative plaque of Pennant stone. The tunnel was begun in 1806 and finished in 1809. It is lined with English bond brickwork and has a wide bore to cope with the Newbury barges used on the canal. There is no towpath through the tunnel, so walkers and cyclists must walk across the top of the hill. When canal boats were pulled by horses the boatmen had to haul their barges through the tunnel by hand, pulling on chains that ran along the inside walls."]}, {"page": "Marquess of Ailesbury", "response": ["*Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1729\u20131814)"]}, {"page": "List of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle", "response": ["|Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury||75px||1739\u20131814||1786||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire", "response": ["*Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury 22 March 1780 \u2013 8 April 1782"]}, {"page": "George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu", "response": ["He was born George Brudenell at Cardigan House, Lincoln's Inn Fields, in London, the eldest son of George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan and his wife Lady Elizabeth Bruce, daughter of Thomas Bruce, 3rd Earl of Elgin.
