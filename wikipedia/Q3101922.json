He obtained a BA in classics from Oxford in 1837 (and an MA in 1843 and DD in 1849) and was ordained as a deacon in 1839 and a priest in 1840 in the Church of England. He rapidly became involved in the Church Missionary Society and he and the Revd Thomas McClatchie arrived in Shanghai on 25 September 1844 to establish a mission. Poor health forced an early return to England, but Smith's Narrative of his period in China was published in 1847.\nSmith worked hard to raise money for further missionary work in China, and in 1849 was made bishop of the new diocese of Victoria (Hong Kong) and warden of the newly founded St Paul's Missionary College (see St. Paul's College). With his new wife Lydia, n\u00e9e Brandram, Smith arrived in Hong Kong on 29 March 1850 and threw himself into missionary and educational work. He learned Mandarin, becoming sufficiently fluent to conduct services in it.\nSmith was also responsible for missionary work in China and Japan. A weak constitution limited this work, but he nevertheless visited Japan (1860), the Ryukyu islands (1850), India and Ceylon (1852\u20131853), Australia (1859), and elsewhere, partly to work for emigrants from China.\nSmith left Hong Kong for the last time in 1864, retiring from the bishopric the next year. He died in his house at Blackheath (then in Kent, now in London), on 14 December 1871 after a short illness.", "link_mentions": {}}}
