Williams and MM, as it was known, helped promote and contextualise the progressive in pop music. In particular, Williams wrote several key articles around 1970 that increased UK attention to the (then disintegrating) Velvet Underground. Melody Maker still covered jazz and Williams wrote about the more progressive developments in this field also.\nThe magazine's serious approach to rock music and culture, under the editorship of Ray Coleman, secured MM a huge circulation by the close of the 1960s and the start of the 1970s. It left New Musical Express, a more pop-orientated weekly, in its wake as MM caught the mood of rock followers at a time when the music had transcended its Top 40 roots to become a powerful symbol of social and cultural change. Williams was a vocal and influential supporter of Bob Marley during the early seventies. He wrote several key features at Melody Maker which resulted in Marley's first important cover stories.\nWilliams moved on to new challenges in the early 1970s. Beginning in May 1970 he contributed to The Times and continued to write for that paper until October 1989. He also wrote regularly for Radio Times. He left journalism to join Island Records' A&R department in 1973, becoming department head. For two years he signed and developed artists including Pete Wingfield, Stone Delight, Bryn Haworth and John Cale.\nThe first presenter of the BBC rock show The Old Grey Whistle Test (launched in 1971) while still a member of the MM team, and shortly thereafter its producer, he later became editor of the new London listings guide Time Out and returned to MM as editor from 1978 to 1980.After a period as features editor at The Sunday Times he became editor of the Independent on Sunday's Sunday Review. His music journalism has been gathered in the volume Long Distance Call: Writings on Music and biographies of Bob Dylan (A Man Called Alias), Miles Davis (The Man in the Green Shirt), and Phil Spector (Out of His Head) are among his list of other publications.\nWilliams remains an active journalist and is the former chief sports writer of The Guardian, covering a full array of sports. He has written several books on Formula One including The Death of Ayrton Senna, Racers (an analysis of the main participants of the 1996 F1 season), Enzo Ferrari: A Life, and The Last Road Race (a study of the changing balance in Formula One between British and Italian teams, using the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix as the backdrop).\nWilliams' comments about music and related film, photography and art topics are published in the form of his blog, The Blue Moment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roxy Music", "response": ["The band's fortunes were greatly increased by the support of broadcaster John Peel and Melody Maker journalist Richard Williams.

Richard Williams was more critical in a retrospective review for Q magazine, writing that Springsteen had exaggerated his usual characters and themes in a deliberate attempt at commercial success.

Vivien Goldman, previously at NME and Sounds, gave the paper much improved coverage of reggae and soul music, restoring the superior coverage of those genres that the paper had in the early 1970s.

According to Williams, the album conveys \"the joy of a boy with a new toy\" and \"sounds like what you might get if you taped a contact microphone to the stomach of a digestively challenged robot\". Scott Elingburg of PopMatters welcomed its Apple Years reissue and described the album as the artist's \"most 'experimental' work\" and, like the remastered Wonderwall Music, \"raw and gorgeous, alive and capable of sparking ingenuity\". He said that while Harrison was not a synthesizer innovator in the mould of Brian Eno or Jeff Lynne, \"the intention behind Electronic Sound is one of exploration and discovery, an artist limbering up his musical mind to discover how far the boundaries of modern instrumentation could take him. Out of context, Electronic Sound would sound maudlin, even dull.

In a review for Uncuts Ultimate Music Guide issue on Harrison, Jon Dale describes Wonderwall Music as \"a beguiling, charming snapshot of a moment in time\".
