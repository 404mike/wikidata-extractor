His  pioneering designs of dinghies using plywood did much to popularise the sport of sailing in the period immediately following World War II.Born in Hammersmith, London near the River Thames Holt designed more than 40 boats, many of which are listed below. He worked for many years with fellow sailing enthusiast and businessman Beecher Moore.Jack Holt was awarded an OBE in 1979 for his services to sailing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dinghy sailing", "response": ["During the Second World War plywood had become a major building material for aircraft. After the war, plywood was adapted for building sailing dinghies. Two primary methods of construction were adopted: stitch and glue and timber-framed construction. Jack Holt designed many dinghies to be built by home handymen using these construction techniques. The Mirror Dinghy was predominantly built using stitch and glue, while the Enterprise and  Heron is an example of a boat built using plywood on a timber frame."]}, {"page": "Mirror (dinghy)", "response": ["The Mirror was designed by Jack Holt and TV do-it-yourself expert Barry Bucknell in 1962. It employed a novel construction method where sheets of marine plywood are held together with copper stitching and fibreglass tape. This is called tack and tape or stitch and glue construction. Buoyancy is provided by four independent integral chambers rather than by bags.  It was originally designed to be built with simple tools and little experience, and this meant that the design was quite simple. For example, the characteristic 'pram' front reduces the need for the more complicated curved wooden panels and joinery needed for a pointed bow, and a daggerboard is used instead of a hinged centreboard. The result is a robust, versatile and fairly light boat that can be easily maintained and repaired, and can also be launched into the water very quickly from storage or transport.  Although most experienced sailors would carry a paddle rather than oars, if necessary it rows well. If the transom is strengthened, an outboard motor can be used for propulsion.", "Richard Creagh-Osborne commented in the Dinghy Yearbook 1964 (pub. Adlard Coles) that the Mirror 'was one of the two best one design dinghies drawn by Jack Holt - the other being the Heron'. Initially the design met with a considerable degree of scepticism from the established boating fraternity due to its unconventional design and construction (actually pioneered by Ken Littledyke for canoe construction) but Creagh-Osbourn and Beecher Moore were two of the highly respected pundits of the dinghy scene who were far sighted enough to see the value of the design, and immediately supported it. Within a few years its dramatically lower cost (only just over half the cost of the Heron or Gull) and massive promotion by the Daily Mirror (under the guidance of a dedicated team headed by Victor Shaw) transformed the boat into the most popular two man dinghy in terms of sales per annum worldwide. This was sadly relatively short lived, and the imposition of 25% VAT in the late 1970s on boats, killed the dinghy market and the sales of the Mirror - it never really recovered, and by the time the economy improved, its franchise of practical post war kit builders had been replaced by kids who had little understanding of the most basic woodworking skills and even less interest - it remains popular but not to the extent and enthusiasm that fostered the book 'Mirrormania' in 1976.Mirror mania Sally Karslake,  Pub. Mirror class Association, 1976 www.worldcat.org, accessed 11 November 2020", "Three other dinghy designs are also associated with the 'Mirror' name: the (Mirror) Miracle of 12\u00a0ft 8ins length, the Marauder (Mirror 14) (14\u00a0ft 6ins), and the Mirror 16 (16\u00a0ft 1ins). Of these, the Marauder was designed by Peter Milne, while the other two were Jack Holt designs. The Miracle also sports a squared-off 'transom bow' (albeit smaller than that of the smaller Mirror), while the two larger designs enjoy a more traditional bow treatment. All of them were conceived as potential home-build projects, though the Marauder is a less obviously hard-chine design.", "Category:Boats designed by Jack Holt"]}, {"page": "Heron (dinghy)", "response": ["The Heron Dinghy is a dinghy designed by Jack Holt of the United Kingdom as the Yachting World Cartopper (YW Cartopper).
