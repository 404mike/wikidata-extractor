The first 13 years were spent at 29 Great George Street, Westminster. There, the collection increased in size from 57 to 208 items, and the number of visitors from 5,300 to 34,500. In 1869, the collection moved to Exhibition Road and buildings managed by the Royal Horticultural Society. Following a fire in those buildings, the collection was moved in 1885, this time to the Bethnal Green Museum. This location was ultimately unsuitable due to its distance from the West End, condensation and lack of waterproofing. Following calls for a new location to be found, the government accepted an offer of funds from the philanthropist William Henry Alexander. Alexander donated \u00a360,000 followed by another \u00a320,000, and also chose the architect, Ewan Christian. The government provided the new site, St Martin's Place, adjacent to the National Gallery, and \u00a316,000. The buildings, faced in Portland stone, were constructed by Shillitoe & Son.Hulme, Graham pg 105 Both the architect, Ewan Christian, and the gallery's first director, George Scharf, died shortly before the new building was completed. The gallery opened at its new location on 4 April 1896. The site has since been expanded twice.

As it was exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857, the curator George Scharf wrote: \"The whole picture, notwithstanding the boldness of the attitudes, is tame, and inadequate in execution.\" This lack of admiration can be explained in comparison to contemporary depictions of the biblical story, especially Belshazzar's Feast by John Martin (c. 1821), that earned much more reputation by its size and grandeur of its composition. This assessment changed in the second half of the 20th century together with the revaluation of Rembrandt's historical paintings. After Belshazzar's Feast was acquired by the National Gallery in 1964, it became very popular and was used many times as an illustration for commercial products like album covers.

In his studies of the Rosetta Stone, the scholar Thomas Young had already realised that the cartouches contained the names of the Pharaohs and he had identified the name 'Ptolemy'. In a marginal note on some of the lithographs, Bankes proposed to identify the name 'Cleopatra' in cartouches on this inscription.

King Maximilian noticed the young artist and purchased his copy of a portrait of Prince Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais. After working for a few years as a miniature painter and drawing master, Scharf learned the technique of lithography, which had been recently invented by his fellow countryman Alois Senefelder. Scharf left Germany and wandered for five years in France and the Low Countries. Caught up in the siege of Antwerp in 1814, Scharf escaped and joined the English army, where he was appointed lieutenant of baggage in the engineer department. In this capacity he was present at the Battle of Waterloo and accompanied the allied armies to Paris. While there, he drew some views of the Bois de Boulogne.

He deduced that Droeshout had inexpertly attempted to add modelling shadows.George Scharf, On the Principal Portraits of William Shakespeare, London, Spottiswoode, 1864, p. 3.

She surmises that Droeshout's engraving may have been derived from this lost portrait.Mary Edmond, \"It was for gentle Shakespeare cut\". Shakespeare Quarterly 42.3 (1991), p. 344.
