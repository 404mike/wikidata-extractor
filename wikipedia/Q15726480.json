He played in Celtic's winning 2015 Scottish League Cup Final team, before going out on three-month loan to Tippeligaen side Rosenborg. The Norwegian club went on to win a domestic league and cup double, and Henderson played enough games for him to earn winner's medals in both competitions. He then went on loan to Hibernian for most of the 2015\u201316 season, helping the club win the 2015\u201316 Scottish Cup. Henderson then rejoined the Celtic squad, but made few first-team appearances.\nHe was transferred to Serie B club Bari in January 2018, then moved to Hellas Verona as a free agent a few months later after Bari were declared bankrupt. He helped Verona to promotion, and in August 2019 became the first Scot to play in a Serie A match since Graeme Souness in 1986.\nHenderson has represented Scotland at various youth levels, including captaining the under-17 team.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Broxburn", "response": ["*Liam Henderson,(footballer)"]}, {"page": "Henderson (surname)", "response": ["*Liam Henderson (born 1996), Scottish football player (Celtic FC, Hibernian FC)", "*Liam Henderson (English footballer) (born 1989), English football player (Watford FC)"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Serie A players", "response": ["*Liam Henderson \u2013 Verona, Empoli \u2013 2019\u201320, 2021\u2013"]}, {"page": "Last-minute goal", "response": ["* 2016 Scottish Cup Final \u2013 Rangers vs. Hibernian, 21 May 2016: Heading into stoppage time, the scoreline was tied at 2\u20132.
