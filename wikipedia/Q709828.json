Plans for 1943 were scuppered by a letter to The Times from Hinsley, stressing Franklin Roosevelt's commitment to freedom of conscience and arguing that Catholic schools should not be bullied by the state, as they often provided for the poorest inner-city communities. Churchill telephoned Butler to tell him. \"You are landing me in the biggest political row of the generation\". (Butler later embellished the story to claim that Churchill had sent him a mounted copy of the letter, with \"There you are, fixed, old cock\" scrawled across it).Howard 1987, pp. 128\u2013129.

This laid the foundation for the creation of the Council of Christians and Jews primarily by William Temple, Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury and Joseph Hertz, Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom towards the end of the Second World War in 1942.
