He is Professor of European Studies at Oxford University. Much of his work has been concerned with the late modern and contemporary history of Central and Eastern Europe.\nHe has written about the former Communist regimes of that region, their experience with the secret police, the Revolutions of 1989 and the transformation of the former Eastern Bloc states into member states of the European Union. He has examined the role of Europe and the challenge of combining freedom and diversity, especially in relation to free speech.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Czechoslovakia", "response": ["*Williams, Kieran, \"Civil Resistance in Czechoslovakia: From Soviet Invasion to \"Velvet Revolution\", 1968\u201389\",in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present (Oxford University Press, 2009)."]}, {"page": "July 12", "response": ["*1955 \u2013 Timothy Garton Ash, English historian and author"]}, {"page": "Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["In March 1990, Thatcher held a Chequers seminar on the subject of German reunification that was attended by members of her cabinet and historians such as Norman Stone, George Urban, Timothy Garton Ash and Gordon A.

As early as 1969, armed campaigns of paramilitary groups began, including the Provisional IRA campaign of 1969\u20131997 which was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland and the creation of a United Ireland, and the Ulster Volunteer Force, formed in 1966 in response to the perceived erosion of both the British character and unionist domination of Northern Ireland. The state security forces \u2013 the British Army and the police (the Royal Ulster Constabulary) \u2013 were also involved in the violence. The British government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Republicans regarded the state forces as combatants in the conflict, pointing to the collusion between the state forces and the loyalist paramilitaries as proof of this.  The \"Ballast\" investigation by the Police Ombudsman has confirmed that British forces, and in particular the RUC, did collude with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and did obstruct the course of justice when such claims had been investigated,The Ballast report : \"...the Police Ombudsman has concluded that this was collusion by certain police officers with identified UVF informants.\" although the extent to which such collusion occurred is still disputed."]}, {"page": "Pope John Paul II", "response": ["The British historian Timothy Garton Ash, who describes himself as an \"agnostic liberal\", said shortly after John Paul II's death:"]}, {"page": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)", "response": ["In the 1980s, Solidarity was a broad anti-bureaucratic social movement, using methods of civil resistance to advance the causes of workers' rights and social change.Aleksander Smolar, Self-limiting Revolution': Poland 1970\u201389\", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009, , pp. 127\u201343.
