A versatile defensive midfielder, Beaumont made the breakthrough into the Dundee United first team during the 1983\u201384 season, but found it hard to get a regular spot in a defence with a back four of Malpas, Gough, Hegarty and Narey. He was used as cover for all four, and appeared as a defensive midfielder occasionally over the next couple of seasons.\nBeaumont spent nearly half of the 1986\u201387 season in the starting eleven, his best run in the first team, making 40 appearances, and played in six matches of United's UEFA Cup run that season, including an appearance as substitute for Paul Sturrock in the first leg of the final. Beaumont left United in January 1989 for Luton Town, for whom he appeared in the 1989 Football League Cup Final.\nHe returned to Scotland with Hibernian in October 1991. Weeks later, he was an unused substitute as they beat Dunfermline Athletic in the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final. Injuries hampered him after this, however, and he was forced to quit the senior game in 1994. Beaumont became a police officer in Fife, playing for the Scottish Police team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1988\u201389 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Dave Beaumont"]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|CB ||6|| Dave Beaumont"]}, {"page": "1987 UEFA Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||14 || Dave Beaumont || || "]}, {"page": "1991 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||14||Dave Beaumont"]}, {"page": "1993 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF||?|| Dave Beaumont"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["Two months then followed without a win, as Dave Beaumont left for Hibernian and new signing Steve Thompson left after only seven matches in a swap deal with Leicester City for Des Linton and Scott Oakes. Talented full back Matt Jackson also moved on, to sign for Everton. Form was no better in the cups, as Luton were knocked out of both the League Cup and the Full Members' Cup in October. The acquisition of goalkeeper Steve Sutton in November raised spirits, though Luton's next victory did not come until 20 December, when a Harford goal sealed a 1\u20130 win over Coventry. The next two matches were at home, and Luton won them both \u2013 another goal from Harford secured a defeat of Arsenal on Boxing Day, and Chelsea were beaten 2\u20130 two days later. Despite three successive wins, Luton still remained in the relegation zone on New Year's Day.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dave Beaumont", "| 10 October 1991 ||  Dave Beaumont ||  Hibernian ||align=\"right\"| \u00a3110,000 ||align=\"center\"|"]}]}}
