The date for the takeover of the New Territories was fixed as 17 April 1899 and Tai Po was chosen as the administrative centre. However the transfer was not smooth and peaceful. Before the handover in early April, Captain Superintendent of Police, Francis Henry May and some policemen erected a flagstaff and temporary headquarters at Tai Po and posted the Governor's proclamation of the takeover date. Fearing for their traditional land rights, in the Six-Day War of 1899, a number of clans attempted to resist the British, mobilising clan militias that had been organised and armed to protect against longshore raids by pirates. The militia men attempted a frontal attack against the temporary police station in Tai Po that was the main British base but were beaten back by superior force of arms. An attempt by the clansmen at guerilla warfare was put down by the British near Lam Tsuen with over 500 Chinese men killed, and collapsed when British artillery was brought to bear on the walled villages of the clansmen. Most prominent of the villages in the resistance Kat Hing Wai, of the Tang clan, was symbolically disarmed, by having its main gates dismounted and removed. However, in order to prevent future resistance the British made concessions to the indigenous inhabitants with regards to land use, land inheritance and marriage laws; the majority of which remained in place into the 1960s when polygamy was outlawed. Some of the concessions with regard to land use and inheritance remain in place in Hong Kong to this day and is a source of friction between indigenous inhabitants and other Hong Kong residents."]}, {"page": "Governor of Hong Kong", "response": ["| Sir Francis Henry May\u6885\u542b\u7406", "| Sir Francis Henry May\u6885\u542b\u7406", "| Sir Francis Henry May\u6885\u542b\u7406"]}, {"page": "Peak Tram", "response": ["*May Road.

No Fijians to date had graduated from a university, and the British colonial administration was unwilling to encourage higher learning for the natives.  However, Ratu Madraiwiwi was personally acquainted with the colonial Governor, Sir Francis Henry May, and in 1911 asked him to try to arrange for his son to study at a British university on the grounds that he had passed the matriculation exams at Wanganui Collegiate School.  May's influence persuaded the British Colonial Secretary, reluctantly, to grant Sukuna a one-year leave of absence from his responsibilities in Fiji to study history at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1913.  Financial constraints had prevented him from realising his dream of pursuing a four-year law degree at Cambridge."]}, {"page": "Secretary for Education (Hong Kong)", "response": ["| Sir Francis Henry May ||"]}, {"page": "Chief Secretary for Administration", "response": ["| rowspan=3| Sir Francis Henry May\u6885\u542b\u7406", "| Sir Francis Henry May"]}, {"page": "Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)", "response": ["| Sir Francis Henry May"]}, {"page": "Cecil Clementi", "response": ["Due to his outstanding performance in the services, Clementi was promoted to Assistant Colonial Secretary and Clerk of Council, in 1907.
