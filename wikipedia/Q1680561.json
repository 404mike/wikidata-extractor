While in command of Phoebe, Hillyar was present at the Invasion of Ile de France in 1810, was heavily engaged at the Battle of Tamatave in 1811 and captured the USS Essex off Valpara\u00edso in Chile in 1814. In addition, Hillyar was engaged in numerous other operations, his first battle occurring in 1781 off Boston. He remained in the Navy until his death in 1843, and was active at sea during the 1830s, commanding fleets in the North Sea and off Portugal. He was knighted twice and two of his sons later became full admirals, Charles Farrell Hillyar and Henry Shank Hillyar.\nHis eldest daughter Mary Ann married January 1843 in Malta Sir Cecil Bisshopp, Bt of Parham in the County of Sussex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joel Roberts Poinsett", "response": ["In early September 1813, the United States Frigate Essex arrived in Chilean waters, forcibly seizing the British whalers in the area.

However, this could not happen until Commodore Porter completed his cruise of the Pacific.  Finally, as the Essex set out with Poinsett aboard, the British frigates HMS Phoebe and HMS Cherub were spotted in the port of Valparaiso.  Commodore Porter returned to Santiago to utilize the guns of the fort there. After waiting six weeks, Porter decided to launch a desperate breakout but was easily defeated by Captain James Hillyar of the Phoebe.

Phoebe was sent to destroy the trading post at Astoria. Dixon detached Cherub and Racoon to guard the whaling fishery, while Phoebes mission was modified, becoming to seek out and capture or destroy Essex. Captain James Hillyar of Phoebe was to keep his mission a secret. The Admiralty would question why Cherub and Racoon were not detached earlier. Dixon would assert that the specie trade was a priority and that only once Phoebe had arrived, would Cherub and Racoon safely get to the Pacific as if Essex had encountered the two sloops on their own, the ships being much smaller, would have surely been captured. Dixon feared that Essex had reinforcements, which it did not, hence, he intended on detaching another frigate to accompany Phoebe in the event that Essex was not alone, but none were available. Hillyar was given complete discretion as Dixon was aware that new intelligence would reach Phoebe much faster than orders from Montagu in Rio de Janeiro would, the only exception being that Phoebe must not violate the neutrality of the Spanish colonies."]}, {"page": "Bishopp baronets", "response": ["* (6 July 1821 \u2013 19 January 1849) was the son of the 9th baronet and married Mary Ann, the eldest daughter of Rear-Admiral Sir James Hillyar, in January 1843.
