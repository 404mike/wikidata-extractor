The officer was superintending his gun at the time and had no weapon in his hand, but Gunner Smith, wielding the hand spike of his gun, warded off the thrust of the spear, giving the lieutenant time to draw his sword and bring the assailant to his knees. The latter, however, made a wild thrust at the officer with a long knife, which Gunner Smith again warded off, but not before the lieutenant was wounded. Gunner Smith then managed to kill the native before he could attack again.In 1895, while working at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, Smith was involved in an accident when his forearm was crushed by machinery.\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, England.\nGunner Smith's unit, 1 Battery, Southern Division, Royal Artillery, was later re-numbered 176 Battery and still exists today. In 1955 it was awarded the honour title \"Abu Klea\" in recognition of Gunner Smith's VC.", "link_mentions": {}}}
