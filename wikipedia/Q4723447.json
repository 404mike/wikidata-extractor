The officer was superintending his gun at the time and had no weapon in his hand, but Gunner Smith, wielding the hand spike of his gun, warded off the thrust of the spear, giving the lieutenant time to draw his sword and bring the assailant to his knees. The latter, however, made a wild thrust at the officer with a long knife, which Gunner Smith again warded off, but not before the lieutenant was wounded. Gunner Smith then managed to kill the native before he could attack again.In 1895, while working at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, Smith was involved in an accident when his forearm was crushed by machinery.\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, England.\nGunner Smith's unit, 1 Battery, Southern Division, Royal Artillery, was later re-numbered 176 Battery and still exists today. In 1955 it was awarded the honour title \"Abu Klea\" in recognition of Gunner Smith's VC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plumstead", "response": ["*Alfred Smith VC (1861 - 6 January 1932)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Abu Klea", "response": ["The battle was short, lasting barely fifteen minutes from start to finish.

Another action happened two days later at Abu Kru (the Battle of El Gubat) and the advance rescue force leader Major General Sir Herbert Stewart was mortally wounded by Remington Rifile Fire by the Madist's that night, he knew it was a mortal wound, and he transferred command to a inexperienced leader, Brigadier General Sir Charles Wilson (the column's intelligence officer) who was slow to organizing his forces and in tarrying another day, it was he who was the cause of that advance detachment's delay."]}, {"page": "Alfred Smith", "response": ["Alfred Smith or Alf Smith may refer to:", "*Alfred Smith (cricketer, born 1812) (1812\u20131892), another English cricketer", "*Alfred Smith (cricketer, born 1847) (1847\u20131915), English cricketer", "*Alfred Smith (Australian cricketer) (1908\u20131989), Australian cricketer", "*Alfred Smith (artist) (1854\u20131932), French artist from Bordeaux", "*Alfred Smith (British politician) (1860\u20131931), Member of Parliament for Sunderland, 1929\u20131931", "*Alfred Smith (supercentenarian) (1908\u20132019), at his death the oldest man in Scotland", "*Alfred Smith (VC) (1861\u20131932), English soldier, recipient of the Victoria Cross in Sudan", "*J.
