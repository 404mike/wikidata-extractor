He had spent the pre-season ahead of the 2012\u201313 season training with the club, although the transfer had been held up while the club waited for confirmation from the Football League in accordance with new financial fair play rules. Beardsley made his Preston debut in a 2\u20130 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 14 August 2012, assisting the club's second goal of the match, with his low cross being scored by Nicky Wroe. He scored his first goal for Preston on 4 September 2012 after converting David Amoo's cross in the third-minute of their 1\u20131 away draw with Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, a tie that Preston won 3\u20131 on penalties. Beardsley scored one further goal that month, heading in Jeffrey Monakana's cross on 64 minutes as Preston came from behind to beat Yeovil Town 3\u20132 at home. It proved to be Beardsley's last goal for five months, ending his goal drought in a 3\u20131 away loss to Yeovil on 12 February 2013, in what was Westley's last match in charge of the club. Beardsley made just two appearances under new manager Simon Grayson over the remainder of the season, both as a second-half substitute. Shortly after the season ended, he was told he could leave Preston if a suitable offer was received. He made 22 appearances during the 2012\u201313 season, scoring 3 times, as Preston ranked in 14th place in League One."]}, {"page": "Adam Murray", "response": ["Murray became caretaker-manager of Mansfield Town after Paul Cox left the club 19th in the League Two table on 21 November 2014. He rejected advice to take an older mentor as his assistant and instead retained existing coaches Richard Cooper and Micky Moore, who he said were \"as hungry as I am for coaching\". Murray's first game as manager, a day later at Field Mill, was a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. After a successful month as caretaker-manager, Murray was given the job on a permanent basis on 5 December, becoming the youngest manager in the top four divisions of English football. He made four free transfer signings in the January transfer window: defenders Junior Brown, Michael Raynes and Matty Blair, and midfielder Ricky Ravenhill. He sold Rob Taylor to Tranmere Rovers after the versatile player sought a move closer to his home. He also made use of the loan market, bringing in Billy Kee, Callum Elder, Lenny Pidgeley, Jeffrey Monakana, Adam Smith and Terry Hawkridge. Murray signed a new two-year contract in May. Mansfield ended the 2014\u201315 season in 21st-place, seven points above relegated Cheltenham Town, and Murray released seven players in the summer, saying that \"I feel the whole club needs a fresh start\". Ollie Palmer was also sold to Leyton Orient."]}, {"page": "Christian Smith (footballer)", "response": ["In June 2019, Smith joined Dulwich Hamlet, along with Wealdstone teammate Jeffrey Monakana. Hamlet won three of their opening four games of the 2019\u201320 season and Smith was quick to praise the training facilities at Champion Hill. On 19 October, he scored the opening goal in a 2\u20131 victory at Havant & Waterlooville that took the club into the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time in 21 years. He also scored in the next round, a 4\u20131 defeat to Carlisle United.

The visitors opened the scoring after just two minutes; Felipe Morais turning in Greg Tansey's cross at the back post. Yeovil responded instantly through Paddy Madden's scissor kick. Shortly after the interval, Lucas Akins was on hand to turn in substitute Marcus Haber's low cross, before James Dunne's deflected effort doubled Stevenage's advantage and put the game beyond doubt. Four days later, Stevenage suffered their second consecutive heavy home defeat, this time losing 4\u20131 to Preston North End. The away side scored early on through Stuart Beavon's powerful strike, before Stevenage's Greg Tansey briefly restored parity with a curling effort from the edge of the area. Preston regained the lead through Jack King following good work from Jeffrey Monakana ten minutes before half-time. Two second-half long-range strikes from Monakana and Nicky Wroe respectively gave Preston a comfortable win. Another defeat followed a week later, losing 4\u20131 away to Sheffield United. The home side took the lead on the twenty-minute mark, defender Neill Collins heading home unmarked from Ryan Flynn's centre. Stevenage equalised just before half-time, captain Mark Roberts scoring with a header from Filipe Morais' corner. The parity was short-lived, however, as Shaun Miller netted twice after the interval, before Chris Porter added a fourth late-on to ensure a routine victory. Stevenage then travelled to Bournemouth three days later, securing a 1\u20131 draw. The visitors took the lead mid-way through the first-half when Marcus Haber found space down the right wing, before laying the ball onto Greg Tansey, who found the net from just outside the area. Bournemouth equalised with fifteen minutes remaining, substitute Matt Tubbs heading in Lewis Grabban's cross at the back post. Another 1\u20131 scoreline followed when Stevenage took on league leaders Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way on 24 November. The game came to life with just ten minutes left; Tranmere striker Jake Cassidy found space in the area, and headed in Adam McGurk's cross unmarked. Stevenage then hit the post late-on through Robin Shroot, before equalising deep into stoppage time when Greg Tansey picked up Mark Roberts' pass and curled a looping shot over Owain F\u00f4n Williams in the Tranmere goal. The goal was Tansey's third in four games."]}, {"page": "Jack King (footballer, born 1985)", "response": ["King experienced full-time professional football for the first time when he signed for League One club Preston North End on a one-year deal in July 2012. Preston manager Graham Westley had previously scouted King several times whilst he managed Stevenage, but felt he was too similar a player to Michael Bostwick, and therefore no move materialised at the time. King made his debut for Preston in a 2\u20130 victory over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 13 August 2012, a game in which he scored the opening goal of the match courtesy of a header. King adjusted well to playing in the Football League for the first time in his career, scoring three times in four games in the opening months of the season; two coming in league victories over Hartlepool United and Doncaster Rovers respectively, and the other in a 3\u20131 League Cup defeat to Middlesbrough at Deepdale. King remained a regular feature under new manager Simon Grayson, and scored his first goal under Grayson's management in Preston's comfortable 3\u20130 victory against Scunthorpe United on 6 April 2013 when he headed in Jeffrey Monakana's cross to complete the win. He played 47 times during the 2012\u201313 campaign, scoring seven times, as Preston finished the season in 14th place."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["In light of the injury crisis, Dunne brought in two loanees in time for the following weekends fixture against Bradford City.
