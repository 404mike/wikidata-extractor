In 2004\u201305, the club had its most successful FA Trophy campaign, reaching the Third round before being eliminated 2\u20131 by Histon. During the summer of 2006, head coach Paul Tisdale left the club to take up the vacant manager's position at Exeter City. He was replaced at Team Bath by Andy Tillson, a former Grimsby Town and Bristol Rovers defender. The 2006\u201307 season brought success to both Bath clubs; Bath City won the Southern League, and Team Bath finished as runners-up. In the playoffs, Team Bath won their semi final against Hemel Hempstead Town 3\u20131, and advanced to play Maidenhead United in the final. Maidenhead, who had been relegated from the Conference South the season before, won the match 1\u20130, consigning Team Bath to another season in the Southern League. Team Bath repeated their league form the following season, and once again finished as runners-up, this time behind King's Lynn. A 4\u20131 victory against Bashley in the playoff semi-final, aided by a hat-trick from the league's top-scorer Sean Canham, saw Bath reach their second successive playoff final. Team Bath improved on the previous season, beating Halesowen Town 2\u20131 in the final, Canham once again providing Bath with a decisive goal in the 89th minute. The win secured the team a place in the Conference South."]}, {"page": "Canham", "response": ["* Sean Canham (born 1984), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["| 14 || FW || Sean Canham || 2 || 0", "| Sean Canham"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["Stevenage hosted Crewe Alexandra in the first weekend of September, which resulted in a 1\u20131 draw. Crewe were forced to wear Stevenage's yellow away strip after the referee deemed their current away kit to clash with the red and white of Stevenage. Stevenage took the lead just before the interval, Yemi Odubade tapping the ball into the net after Stacy Long's initial shot had rebounded off of the post. Crewe equalised ten minutes into the second-half, Ashley Westwood scoring from just outside the area. The home side were reduced to ten men just minutes later as Long was sent-off for two bookable offences. A week later, Stevenage lost their second league game of the season, losing 1\u20130 to Cheltenham Town at Whaddon Road. The following game, Stevenage drew 0\u20130 at home to Torquay United \u2013 who had sat at the top of the table before the start of the match. Stevenage won their first away game of the season against Lincoln City, winning 1\u20130 at Sincil Bank. New loan signing Chris Holroyd scored the only goal of the game just before half-time, lashing the ball high into the roof of the net after Charlie Griffin had brought down Darius Charles' throw-in. First-team coach Dino Maamria was also listed as a substitute, but was unused. Three days later, Stevenage recorded their second away win of the campaign, beating Hereford United 4\u20131. Stevenage opened the scoring after thirteen minutes, Chris Holroyd latching onto Lawrie Wilson's cross to give the visitors a one-goal lead going into the interval. However, just four minutes into the second-half Hereford restored parity through Sean Canham. On the hour mark, the away side led once again, Jon Ashton heading home Wilson's corner to score his first goal of the season. Stevenage doubled their advantage just seven minutes later, Chris Holroyd scoring from six yards out. Holroyd completed his hat-trick with ten minutes remaining; Peter Vincenti broke down the right, squared the ball to Holroyd who composed himself before scoring his fourth goal in two games."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| 10 ||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Sean Canham", "| Sean Canham", "| Sean Canham"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|| Sean Canham"]}]}}
