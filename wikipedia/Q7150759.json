Brian Lee was appointed in December and took charge of his first game on 28 December 1968, a 0\u20130 draw at Clapton Lee's appointed was a real watershed moment for the club and within a month Lee was picking the team and the Selection Committee was disbanded. Lee's impact was even greater, and he started to rebuild the team in the summer of 1969. The reserve side was disbanded, due to limited resources. The quartered kit were also changed, the side wearing plain Cambridge blue shirts and Oxford blue shorts. Geoff Anthony, Peter Suddaby, John Delaney, Johnny Hutchinson and Keith Searle all joined the club and the side finished as runners-up in the league to Enfield Wanderers legend Len Worley played his last game for the club, as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win at Croydon Amateurs on 13 December 1969. He played 512 games for Wycombe, scoring 67 goals. Ted Powell, Larry Pritchard and Paul Fuschillo joined the club in the summer of 1970 and a hugely talented team won the club's third Isthmian League title, pipping Sutton United to the Championship by just one point. The quarter-finals of the FA Amateur Cup were reached again, but Skelmersdale United stunned at 10,203 crowd winning 3\u20130 at Loakes Park. The title was retained the following season as the side flew out of the traps, losing just one of its first 22 league matches, scored 102 goals in 40 games. The club was, however, determined to repeat its one and only FA Amateur Cup triumph and Aveley, Spennymoor United, Walton and Hersham and Hayes were beaten as the Blues reached the semi-final. It was played at Griffin Park, Brentford, scene of defeat in the semi-final of 1950. The opponents this time were Isthmian League rivals Hendon Wycombe were missing the influential Larry Pritchard through injury. The majority of the 9,210 crowd travelled from High Wycombe and they were aghast to see the Dons take the lead against the run of play after 14 minutes. Johnny Hutchinson equalised on 60 minutes but Hendon grabbed a winner with a lon-range shot that stood despite appeals that a Hendon player was in an offside position."]}, {"page": "Fuschillo, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Fuschillo"]}]}}
