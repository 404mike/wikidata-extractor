Early marriage and exile from Cuba in the wake of the Castro revolution put a halt to her career, which she resumed after the birth of her third child in the early 1960s. She went on to dance in the United States with Ballet Concerto in Miami, became principal dancer with the National Ballet of Washington, D.C., and has performed in principal guest roles with the National Ballet of Venezuela, Washington Ballet, Ballet Spectacular.

Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: \"No, No, No\" centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and \"The Rest Cure\" told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him.Stone, p. 28. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: \"Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We do not want to see either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic.\"Cecchi, Emilio. La Tribuna, quoted in Wilson, p. 111.
