In the end, Theophilos chose Theodora, and indicated his choice by giving her a golden apple. According to the later chronicler Symeon Logothete, Theophilos had at first been struck by the beauty of another girl, Kassia (later a prominent poet and composer) and cynically said to her that \"through a woman, evils came to man\" (referring to Eve). This comment, deemed by Judith Herrin to have been an \"unfortunate way to engage a future wife's affections\", prompted Kassia to reply \"through a woman, better things began\" (referring to the Virgin Mary). After Kassia's response,  Theophilos, taken aback by the bold retort, passed her by and gave the apple to Theodora. According to Warren Treadgold, Theodora was \"beautiful, sensible and adaptable, and suited him well; but Theophilus seems to initially not have realized that his bride, like Euphrosyne, was an iconophile\". Theodora was crowned empress in the Church of St Stephen in Daphne on 5 June 830 and the couple were then married in the Hagia Sophia."]}, {"page": "Duff Cooper Prize", "response": ["*2020 \u2013 Judith Herrin, Ravenna: Capital of Empire, Crucible of Empire"]}, {"page": "Rosamond McKitterick", "response": ["In 2010 McKitterick was awarded the Dr A.
