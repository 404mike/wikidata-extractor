He served as Member of Parliament for Epsom for 23 years, from 1955 to 1978, and held the offices of Solicitor General (1962\u20131964) and Attorney General for England and Wales (1970\u20131974) and for Northern Ireland (1972\u20131974). Had he been appointed Lord Chancellor, as seemed likely during the mid-1970s, he would have been the first Roman Catholic to hold that position since Thomas More in 1532.", "link_mentions": {}}}
