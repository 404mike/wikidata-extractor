Around this time too the Royal Navy were perfecting the Brotherhood burner cycle engine which offered a performance as good as the oxygen-enriched air engine but without the issues arising from the oxygen equipment and which was first used in the extremely successful and long-lived 21 in. Mk. VIII torpedo of 1925. This torpedo served throughout WW II (with 3,732 being fired by September 1944) and is still in limited service in the 21st Century. The improved Mark VIII** was used in two particularly notable incidents; on 6 February 1945 the only intentional wartime sinking of one submarine by another while both were submerged took place when HMS Venturer sank the German submarine U-864 with four Mark VIII** torpedoes and on 2 May 1982 when the Royal Navy submarine  sank the Argentine cruiser  with two Mark VIII** torpedoes during the Falklands War. This is the only sinking of a surface ship by a nuclear-powered submarine in wartime and the second (of three) sinkings of a surface ship by any submarine since the end of World War II).

In April 1918, the regiment was despatched to France, where Christie was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment as a signalman. During the following June, he was injured in a mustard gas attack and spent a month in a military hospital in Calais. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him blind and mute for three and a half years.Kennedy, p. 29 His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to talk much louder than a whisper for the rest of his life. Ludovic Kennedy wrote that no record of Christie's blindness has been traced and that, while he may have lost his voice when he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute. His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argued, was a psychological reaction to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas.Kennedy, pp. 30\u201332. The reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying personality disorder that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to get attention and sympathy.Kennedy, p. 33", "The evidence of builders working at the house was ignored,John Christie of Rillington Place: Biography of a Serial Killer p. 73 and their various interviews with Evans suggest that the police concocted a false confession. It should have been clear, for example, from the very first statement made by Evans in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, on 30 November 1949, that he was totally unaware of the resting place of the body of his wife or how she had been killed.The Murders of the Black Museum p. 466 He claimed that his wife's body was in either a manhole or a drain at the front of the house,The Murders of the Black Museum p. 467 but a police search failed to find any remains there. That should have prompted a thorough search of the house, wash-house and garden, but no further action was taken until later, when the two bodies were found in the wash-house. Evans was also totally unaware at his first interview that his daughter had been killed. The police interrogation in London was mishandled from the start, when they showed him the clothes of his wife and baby and revealed that they had been found in the wash-house. Such information should have been kept from him so as to force him to tell police where the bodies had been concealed. The several apparent \"confessions\" contain questionable words and phrases in high-register language such as \"terrific argument\" which seem out of place for a distressed, uneducated, working-class young man such as Evans and bear no relation to what he probably said. These were almost certainly inventions made much later by the police, according to comments made by Ludovic Kennedy long after the truth about Christie had emerged.The Psychology of Interrogations and Confessions: A Handbook p. 169"]}]}}
