She was created Baroness Featherstone, of Highgate in the London Borough of Haringey on 20 October.Under the Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010 she was appointed as a Home Office Minister with responsibility for criminal information and equalities, before being promoted, in 2012, Minister with responsibility for International Development. Previously she was Liberal Democrat spokesman for Youth and Equality issues, and chair of the Liberal Democrats technology board. As originator and architect of the same sex marriage law during the coalition, Featherstone launched the consultation by the UK Government on introducing same-sex marriage and was the first politician to take part in the Out4Marriage campaign, and returned to the Home Office as Minister of State in November 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Page 3", "response": ["Page 3 was controversial and divisive throughout its history. Its defenders often represented the feature as an inoffensive aspect of British culture, as when Conservative Party MP Richard Drax in 2013 called it a \"national institution\" that provided \"light and harmless entertainment\". Many of its critics considered it demeaning and objectifying to women, or as softcore pornography inappropriate for publication in a national newspaper readily available to children. Some politicians, notably including Labour Party MPs Clare Short, Harriet Harman, and Stella Creasy, Liberal Democrats MP Lynne Featherstone, and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, took stances against Page 3 and made efforts to have it removed from newspapers. Meanwhile, The Sun vigorously defended the feature, often responding to criticism with ad hominem attacks. When Short tried in 1986 to introduce a House of Commons bill banning topless models from British newspapers, The Sun ran a \"Stop Crazy Clare\" campaign, distributing free car stickers, calling Short a \"killjoy\", printing unflattering images of her, and polling readers on whether they would prefer to see Short's face or the back of a bus.", "Lucy-Anne Holmes, a writer and actress from Brighton, began the No More Page 3 campaign after noticing during the 2012 Summer Olympics that the largest photograph of a woman in the nation's best-selling newspaper was not of an Olympic medalist, but of \"a young woman in her knickers\". Holmes argued that Page 3 perpetuated outdated sexist norms, portrayed women as sex objects, negatively affected girls' and women's body image, and contributed to a culture of sexual violence. Launched in August 2012, the campaign gained support at the Liberal Democrats party conference the following month, where former MP Evan Harris proposed a party motion to \"[tackle] the projection of women as sex objects to children and adolescents by restricting sexualised images in newspapers and general-circulation magazines to the same rules that apply to pre-watershed broadcast media\". Liberal Democrats MP Lynne Featherstone supported the motion, claiming that Page 3 contributed to domestic violence against women, although the party's then-leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg distanced himself from it over concerns about press freedom, stating: \"If you don't like it, don't buy it ... you don't want to have a moral policeman or woman in Whitehall telling people what they can and cannot see\". The No More Page 3 campaign collected over 240,000 signatures on an online petition and gained support from over 140 MPs, as well as a number of trade unions, universities, charities, and women's advocacy groups. It sponsored two women's soccer teams, Nottingham Forest Women F.C. and Cheltenham Town L.F.C., who played with the \"No More Page 3\" logo on their shirts."]}, {"page": "Julie Burchill", "response": ["On 13 January 2013, Burchill wrote an article for The Observer defending Suzanne Moore after a reference by Moore to transsexuals had been greeted with a great deal of criticism. In Burchill's view, it showed the \"chutzpah\" of transsexuals to have their \"cock cut off and then plead special privileges as women\". There were a number of objections to her writing from members of the transgender community and non-transgender community alike. The editor of The Observer, John Mulholland, responded on the comments page to what he described as \"many emails protesting about this piece\" and stated that he would be looking into the issue. Liberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone, formerly a junior Minister for Women and Equalities, called for the dismissal of Burchill and Mulholland in response to the piece.

The piece should not have been published in that form. I don't want the Observer to be conducting debates on those terms or with that language. It was offensive, needlessly.
