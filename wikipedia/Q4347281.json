In October 1883, he joined Bolton Wanderers, becoming the first Welsh player to move to England in pursuit of a professional football career; however, professionalism was not legalised until July 1885, and he had to leave the club after 21 months. After moving to Manchester to become a fitter with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at their carriage and wagon works in Newton Heath, he joined the company's football team and played in their first major competitive fixture, an FA Cup First Round tie away to Fleetwood Rangers on 30 October 1886; the match finished in a 2\u20132 draw, but Newton Heath were eliminated after refusing to play extra time.Powell quickly became the club's first-choice right-back and was made club captain in 1887. He played in all but one match in Newton Heath's first season of organised league football in 1888\u201389, when they were awarded The Combination title despite not all the teams having completed their fixture schedules. The following year, Newton Heath's first season in the Football Alliance, Powell and his fellow full-back John Mitchell switched sides, with Powell taking over at left-back. However, it proved to be Powell's last full season with the club, as he only played four more games in 1890\u201391, his final competitive appearance coming in the FA Cup Second Round Qualifying defeat to Bootle Reserves on 25 October 1890. He was replaced as captain by George Evans, before retiring at the end of the season.\nOver the span of his career, Powell made 15 appearances for Wales, five of them while with Newton Heath.After his retirement from football, Powell continued to work for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway before becoming a pub licensee in Manchester and later Wrexham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. players", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| Jack Powell"]}, {"page": "1886\u201387 in English football", "response": ["|William Cobbold (Cambridge University) (14mins), Tinsley Lindley (Cambridge University) (55 & 80 mins) & Jack Powell (Own goal) (75 mins)"]}, {"page": "Llewelyn Kenrick", "response": ["Kenrick missed the 1878 match against Scotland (lost 9\u20130) but returned to the side the following year for matches against England and Scotland.

Jack Powell missed his train connection at Chester and Kenrick turned out in his everyday clothes to give \"a splendid performance\" at right-back. Some years later, William Pierce Owen recalled the match at Blackburn:It was snowing and hailing and we had been playing for some time, when I saw what I thought was a spectator breaking into the field and making a violent attack upon Marshall and Rostron, the English right wing. Upon closer inspection I found it was Llewelyn Kenrick of Ruabon. He was dressed in long tweed trousers, wore ordinary boots and sported a smart Oxford shirt. He played with the utmost vigour until unfortunately his knee gave way and once more Wales had only ten men on the field.Davies and Garland (1991), p. 157"]}, {"page": "1947 in Wales", "response": ["*16 March - Jack Powell, footballer, 86"]}, {"page": "1860 in Wales", "response": ["*25 March \u2013 Jack Powell, footballer (died 1947"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["* First international: Jack Powell and Tom Burke for Wales against England (26 February 1887)"]}, {"page": "1886\u201387 Newton Heath LYR F.C. season", "response": ["The 1886\u201387 FA Cup was Newton Heath's first foray into a major competitive football tournament.
