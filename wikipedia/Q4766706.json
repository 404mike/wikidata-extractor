At Middlesex, she was the first woman and the first neurosurgeon on staff, as well as being the only consultant neurosurgeon in western Europe and North America at the time. Beck set up and ran the neurosurgery service at Middlesex, and published important research on the management of intracerebral haemorrhage. In 1952 she received attention in the press for performing surgery on A. A. Milne, the author of Winnie-the-Pooh, two months after he suffered a stroke. The Times praised her \"remarkable piece of surgery\", but Milne's biographer Ann Thwaite claimed that the surgery left him \"partly paralyzed\" with a \"distinct change in character\"; he died three years later."]}]}}
