This production revived at the Gielgud Theatre, in London's West End from 17 September 2010 until 15 January 2011. The principal cast was David Haig as Jim Hacker, Henry Goodman as Sir Humphrey, Jonathan Slinger as Bernard Woolley and Emily Joyce as Claire Sutton, Hacker's special policy advisor. This production, while following the spirit and tone of the original series in many respects, was set contemporaneously at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence, with BlackBerrys frequently in evidence,Remarkably, Sir Humphrey was able to show Bernard Woolley how to disable the Prime Minister's BlackBerry. and even included a topical reference to a coalition agreement which Sir Humphrey had drafted (the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats having formed a coalition government in Britain in May 2010).Antony Jay & Jonathan Lynn (2010) Yes, Prime Minister (the play) (Faber & Faber). In reality, during the negotiations that led to the coalition government in 2010, the two parties appear largely to have shunned support available to them from the civil service: see David Laws (2010) 22 Days in May and Rob Wilson (2010) 5 Days To Power, who concluded that, \"probably the influence of the civil service, including the Cabinet Secretary, in pushing the [parties] together to avoid a financial crisis has been overplayed\". The plot was a little more provocative and risqu\u00e9 than most of those seen previously (including a debate about the ethics of procuring a twelve-year-old as a sexual partner for a visiting dignitary,Yes, Prime Minister, act 1, scene 2 (pages 36\u201340) a proposition which it is suggested might be spun in the national interest as a \"euro-job\")Yes, Prime Minister, act 2, scene 1 (page 61). The suggestion of \"euro-job\" was prompted by Hacker's objection to \"Anglo-Kumranistan Liaison Project\" as \"a bit of a mouthful\": ibid. and included some stronger expletives (reflecting perhaps their widely reported use among New Labour's hierarchy between 1997 and 2010).See, for example, Alastair Campbell (2007) The Blair Years; Andrew Rawnsley (2010) The End of the Party; Anthony Seldon  & Guy Lodge (2010) Brown at 10. There was also a higher element of traditional farce.David Haig interviewed in Country Life, 8 September 2010", "The play features a new character, Claire Sutton, who is introduced by the Prime Minister as head of the policy unit at Number Ten. She is a 21st-century successor to Dorothy Wainwright, but less haughty and seemingly more willing to get her hands dirty. She is described by Jay and Lynn as in her late thirties, attractive and intelligent. She calls Hacker by his first name (\"Fiscal mechanics, Jim\"), whereas Dorothy addressed him as \"Prime Minister\". In response to a sarcastic interjection about \"starving permanent secretaries\", Sir Humphrey patronises her as \"dear lady\" (as he did \"that Wainwright female\" in the TV series).Jay & Lynn (2010) Yes, Prime Minister, especially pages 14, 32 and 81-3.
