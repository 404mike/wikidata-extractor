Beatrice was also the last of Queen Victoria's children to die, 66 years after the first, her elder sister Alice.\nBeatrice's childhood coincided with Queen Victoria's grief following the death of her husband on 14 December 1861. As her elder sisters married and left their mother, the Queen came to rely on the company of her youngest daughter, whom she called \"Baby\" for most of her childhood. Beatrice was brought up to stay with her mother always and she soon resigned herself to her fate. The Queen was so set against her youngest daughter marrying that she refused to discuss the possibility. Nevertheless, many suitors were put forward, including Louis Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial, the son of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France, and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, the widower of Beatrice's older sister Alice. She was attracted to the Prince Imperial and there was talk of a possible marriage, but he was killed in the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879.\nBeatrice fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg, the son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia von Hauke and brother-in-law of her niece Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. After a year of persuasion, the Queen, whose consent was required pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act, finally agreed to the marriage, which took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July 1885. Queen Victoria consented on condition that Beatrice and Henry make their home with her and that Beatrice continue her duties as the Queen's unofficial secretary. The Prince and Princess had four children, but 10 years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of malaria while fighting in the Anglo-Asante War. Beatrice remained at her mother's side until Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901. Beatrice devoted the next 30 years to editing Queen Victoria's journals as her designated literary executor and continued to make public appearances. She died at 87, outliving all her siblings, all of her siblings' spouses, two of her children, and several nieces and nephews including Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and George V of United Kingdom.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 14", "response": ["*1857 \u2013 Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (d. 1944)"]}, {"page": "October 26", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "1944", "response": ["** Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, youngest and last surviving child of Queen Victoria (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "1896", "response": ["** Prince Henry of Battenberg, Lombardy-born British royal, married to Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "1857", "response": ["** Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, youngest child of Queen Victoria (d. 1944)"]}, {"page": "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)", "response": ["Alix's godparents were the Prince and Princess of Wales (her maternal uncle and aunt), Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (her maternal aunt), the Duchess of Cambridge (her great-grand-aunt), the Tsesarevich and Tsesarevna of Russia (her future parents-in-law), and Princess Anna of Prussia."]}, {"page": "Princess Margaret of Connaught", "response": ["Princess Margaret was born at Bagshot Park and baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on 11 March 1882 by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
