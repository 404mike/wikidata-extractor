He joined Chelmsford City, where his performances attracted the attention of Chesterfield. He signed for the League Two side in January 2013, where he would make his professional debut. He was then signed by Rotherham United, but struggled to hold down a regular starting berth, his one and only goal came in a 5-1 defeat to Bournemouth in the FA Cup in 2015. He was subsequently loaned out during the 2014\u201315 season to Scunthorpe United, Oxford United and Colchester United. Following his release from Rotherham in the summer of 2015, he joined Colchester United on a permanent basis.

As a result, he found himself rotating in and out of the starting line\u2013up over the position, due to competition and his own injury concern. Bradley scored his first goal of the season, on 5 October 2013, with a header in the first half, in a 1\u20130 win over Brentford. However, he suffered a groin injury that kept him out for a month. It wasn't until on 7 December 2013 when Bradley made his return from injury, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20131 loss against Rochdale. Following his return from injury, he continued to regain his first team place in the right\u2013back position despite the arrival of James Tavernier and facing his own injury concern. Because of the competitions that Bradley faced, he played in different positions, playing either the defender or midfield positions. Bradley then scored his second goal of the season on 11 March 2014, but then twisted his knee and was substituted, as Rotherham United beat Oldham Athletic. After the match, Manager Steven Evans remained optimistic that Bradley's injury wasn't serious. However, it was announced that Bradley would be out for the rest of the 2013\u201314 season. While on the sidelines, he watched as the club beat Leyton Orient 4\u20133 on penalties following a 2\u20132 draw throughout 120 minutes, a win that saw Rotherham United promoted to the Championship. At the end of the 2013\u201314 season, Bradley made twenty\u2013eight appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

It was then announced on 15 May that club captain Magnus Okuonghae would not be offered a new deal to remain with the club when his deal expired. Okuonghae, who had spent six years with the U's, played 215 games for the club, but a ruptured achilles tendon early in the previous campaign brought a premature end to his season. Tony Humes described Okuonghae as \"an excellent servant to the club\".

Chris Porter, who captained the side during the first-half, scored the opening goal after 24 minutes from a Richard Brindley cross. Brindley was again the provider for triallist Olly Lee to score the second soon after.

In the home encounter with Chesterfield on 16 February, the U's looked to capitalise on an early red card for Chesterfield's Gary Liddle after a foul on Kane Vincent-Young. They took the lead through Macauley Bonne on 69\u00a0minutes, but the lead lasted just three minutes when Lee Novak equalised from the penalty spot after Richard Brindley brought Ollie Banks down in the area.
