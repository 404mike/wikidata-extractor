The latter expedition was plagued with personality conflicts and the withdrawal of many climbers. While in camp, some other climbers overheard news that England had lost a football match to Germany. \"It seems we have beaten you at your national sport\", said a German. After a pause Whillans replied, \"Aye, and we've beaten you at yours...twice.\" Another incident occurred one night in an alpine hut when two climbers were engaged in a whispered conversation disturbing the sleep of other climbers, one of whom was Whillans. Eventually he demanded that they shut up; there was a brief pause before one of the youths aggressively refused to be quiet, remarking into the darkness \"Who do you think you are?\" The gruff reply of \"Whillans\" was followed by complete silence. However, Whillans's biographer Jim Perrin suggests many of these stories are myths. Whillans liked to emphasise his working class credentials, and on lecture tours, enjoyed telling the story of being stormbound in a tent high in the Himalayas with Dougal Haston who had finished reading The Lord of the Rings and passed him the book. Whillans read a few pages and remarked: \"I'm not reading that crap, it's full of fooking fairies\"!", "He died at the age of 52 of a heart attack and was the subject of a biography titled The Villain by the author\u2013climber Jim Perrin in 2005.", "* Jim Perrin (2005), The Villain : the Life of Don Whillans, Hutchinson, .", "* Tom Patey \u2013 A Short Walk With Whillans \u2013 SMC Journal 1963, and included in Mirrors in the Cliffs ed.
