He was born on 3 Oct. 1792 at Weston Favell in Northamptonshire. He is remarkable as having compiled over 100 publications but whether as bookseller, lecturer, 'general factor,' or school-master, Cole was invariably unsuccessful. As self-trained and industrious antiquary, he appears to have been utterly unsuited for the cares of a business life and  he was constantly on the move and  died in poverty. Cole generally printed only few copies of his books which make them rare. As his books contain much out-of-the-way information, they are sought after by collectors. He was in the habit of binding up extra plates and additional manuscript matter in his private copies. A silhouette portrait of Cole and facsimile of his handwriting are given in the Yorkshire Library", "link_mentions": {}}}
