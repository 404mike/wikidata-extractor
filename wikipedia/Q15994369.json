He was born on 3 Oct. 1792 at Weston Favell in Northamptonshire. He is remarkable as having compiled over 100 publications but whether as bookseller, lecturer, 'general factor,' or school-master, Cole was invariably unsuccessful. As self-trained and industrious antiquary, he appears to have been utterly unsuited for the cares of a business life and  he was constantly on the move and  died in poverty. Cole generally printed only few copies of his books which make them rare. As his books contain much out-of-the-way information, they are sought after by collectors. He was in the habit of binding up extra plates and additional manuscript matter in his private copies. A silhouette portrait of Cole and facsimile of his handwriting are given in the Yorkshire Library", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Chichele", "response": ["Thomas Chichele's occupation does not appear but his eldest son, William, is on the earliest extant list (1383) of the Grocers' Company, London. On 9 June 1405 Henry Chichele was admitted, in succession to his father, to a burgage in Higham Ferrers. His mother, Agnes Pincheon, is said to have been of gentle birth. There is therefore no foundation in fact for the account (copied into the Dictionary of National Biography from a local historian, John Cole, Wellingborough, 1838) that he was picked up, as a poor ploughboy \"eating his scanty meal off his mother's lap\", by William of Wykeham. This story was unknown to Arthur Duck, Fellow of All Souls, who wrote Chichele's life in 1617."]}, {"page": "Francis Wrangham", "response": ["John Cole included a catalogue of Wrangham's library in A Bibliographical and Descriptive Tour of Scarborough (1824).
