We are all thrilled about it and I can't wait to be with her on set to show her around.\" A show source added \"Brooke was behind her all the way and was praying she would get the part \u2013 and after Ellie won the bosses over she couldn't contain herself. She was so pleased and happy for her. Ellie-Louise is made of the same stuff as Brooke, which means she'll fit in and get on well with everyone.\" Storylines involving Faye include being adopted by Anna (Debbie Rush) and Eddie Windass (Steve Huison), being hit by her mother's partner Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) in a controversial plot, being bullied herself and being peer pressured into bullying Simon Barlow (Alex Bain), contacting her birth father Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) which ultimately leads to her falsely accusing Anna of abusing her and falling pregnant at the age of twelve and only letting best friend Craig Tinker (Colson Smith) know and struggling to cope with daughter Miley Windass (Erin, Eilah and Elsie Halliwell).", "Hayley books a holiday for herself and Roy, but he is uncertain about leaving the caf\u00e9 with his mother, who tells him to relax because she has got Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) to help her. While Roy and Hayley are away, Sylvia introduces a new regime into the caf\u00e9 by setting prices on condiments like milk, sugar and tomato sauce and even charging to use the caf\u00e9 toilet and giving customers smaller portions on their plates. This upsets the likes of Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), Karl Munro (John Michie) and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). Eventually, Norris decides to ruin Sylvia's ideas by staying in the caf\u00e9 after it closes making Sylvia serve him, when Norris needs the toilet, Sylvia decides to lock him in the lavatory, leaving Norris for the night.

Of filming the labour scenes, Foote told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy \"I was really nervous leading up to doing the scenes, and there was quite a long wait to do them. We filmed the storyline out of sequence, so I filmed quite a lot of scenes which take place after the baby arrives before I'd actually filmed the birth. But then the shoot for these scenes finally came up.\" The actress said it was strange, but she had support from Debbie Rush (who plays Anna Windass) and a midwife. Katy goes into labour while she is playing Mary in a nativity play and Foote said she is quite shocked when she realises the baby is coming. Katy is also scared because she is not giving birth in a hospital, which would be more comfortable for her. While Katy is giving birth, Chesney is trying to get to the community centre in time. In his absence, Anna helps support Katy. When asked if she was pleased with the baby's name, Joseph Peter, Foote said \"I'm surprised it's not Jesus! They've obviously gone for the next best thing instead by choosing Joseph. It's a nice name, and then they've chosen Peter as a way of remembering Schmeichel the dog, so that's really nice too.\" Foote added she had found working with the baby who plays Joseph really good and she had had practice with a baby before when her character looked after Chesney's young niece.
