In this version, he has some form of schizophrenia that hinders him because his supply of medication was destroyed when he goes back in time; making matters worse is that since he did not take it in regular doses, it no longer has any effect on him. Without his medication, he acts more erratic and suffers from memory loss. When he sees the Fatal Five on the news, which pulls a trigger in his mind and makes him remember (although not too well) of his goal, Kallor's behavior worsens and he uses his powers to get out of Arkham and, ultimately, get involved with the main plot of the movie. Because Jessica Cruz also suffers from some mental illness (in her case, severe PTSD and survivor's guilt), she forms a strong friendship with him and easily connects with him. He ultimately sacrifices himself to pull the sun back together after Emerald Empress attempted to destroy it to wipe out Earth, therefore the Legion in the future.
