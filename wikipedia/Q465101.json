He was the chief excavator of the first archaeological expedition to Lachish (Tell ed-Duweir) from 1932 to his death.\nStarkey was robbed and killed near Bayt Jibrin on a track leading from Bayt Jibrin to Hebron. Issa Battat, a rebel commander from the ad-Dhahiriya area who led a rebel unit during the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine against the British, was held responsible by the British authorities for Starkey's killing. Battat was later killed in an ambush by British forces in May 1938. On the other hand, Yosef Garfinkel has suggested that the murder of Starkey had more to do with a dispute between the archaeologists, the government, and the Arab owners of the Lachish site. No agreement had been reached for access to the top of the mound and the government was in the process of compulsorily expropriating it.Starkey is buried in Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion, Jerusalem.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tel Lachish", "response": ["The first expedition at Lachish, then Tell ed-Duweir, from 1932 to 1939, was the Starkey-Tufnell British expedition which included James Leslie Starkey as expedition leader, Olga Tufnell, G.L.

They succeeded in finding Lachish, with a \"wealth of well-stratified pottery\", a \"key part of the ceramic corpus of Palestine\", and the Lachish Letters, c. \"written to the commander of the garrison at Lachish shortly before it fell to the Babylonians in either 589 or 586 B.C.\" Starkey was murdered in 1938 while travelling to Jerusalem to open the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum.

Tufnell returned to London and over the next two decades, worked at the Institute of Archaeology in London, \"sorting, collating, studying and presenting the material found at Lachish\".
