Malcolm Warner is now the Director of the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach, California, and was previously the Deputy Director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas from 2007-2012,  having held his position as senior curator since 2002.  Previous positions include research curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, curator of European art at the San Diego Museum of Art, and senior curator of Paintings and Sculpture at the Yale Center for British Art. He received his Ph.D. from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London on the professional career of John Everett Millais.He is responsible for the organization of many important exhibitions such as The Victorians; British painting from 1837-1901 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. (1997), Stubbs and the Horse, an exhibit at the National Gallery of London of paintings, engravings, and detailed anatomical studies of horses done by George Stubbs, This other Eden: paintings from the Yale Center for British Art, The Mirror and the Mask; Portraiture in the age of Picasso, and Butchers, Dragons, Gods and Skeletons, a collection of film installations by Philip Haas.  \nThe New York Times review of Warner's book for The Victorians exhibition said that, in addition to the expected \"languidly draped ladies of the popular Pre-Raphaelite painters\", readers \"may be pleasantly surprised . . . by some of the other color plates (and substantial explications)\". The Contemporary Review called this book \"an important work for all students of the Victorian era\", and added, \"The descriptions of the paintings by Malcolm Warner, assisted by other scholars, provide a model of the way to explain the symbolism and significance of works of art in a detailed but easily understood manner.\" His other books include The Phaidon companion to art and artists in the British Isles with Michael Jacobs (1980), and Friendship and loss in the Victorian portrait: May Sartoris by Frederic Leighton (Yale University Press, 2009).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laguna Art Museum", "response": ["* The first Art & Nature took place in 2013. The centerpiece installation of the event was Sand Drawing by Jim Denevan, a monumental pattern of spirals displayed on the Main Beach. Denevan began work on the installation at 4 a.m. Along with forty volunteers, he worked throughout the day, tracing in the sand intricate geometric designs with solar lanterns that lit up to reveal a lotus flower design and other patterns when darkness fell. In addition to Jim Denevan's piece, Art & Nature included other nature-themed exhibitions such as Adam Silverman: Clay and Space, Sea Change: Tanya Aguiniga's Bluebelt Forest, and ex\u2022pose: Richard Kraft.  These exhibitions were also supplemented with a keynote lecture by Kevin Starr, a lecture by Malcolm Warner, panel discussions, and a music concert: Surround Art & Sound by Herman Ekbote and Suman Laha.  "]}, {"page": "Autumn Leaves (painting)", "response": ["The painting has typically been interpreted as a representation of the transience of youth and beauty, a common theme in Millais's art. Malcolm Warner argues that Millais was influenced by the poetry of Tennyson, at whose house he had once helped to rake together autumn leaves. Warner suggests that lines from Tennyson's song \"Tears, Idle Tears\" in The Princess (1847) may have influenced him:"]}, {"page": "Hope (painting)", "response": ["Watts himself was ambivalent when questioned about the religious significance of the image, saying that \"I made Hope blind so expecting nothing\", although after his death his widow Mary Seton Watts wrote that the message of the painting was that \"Faith must be the companion of Hope. Faith is the substance, the assurance of things hoped for, because it is the evidence of things not seen.\" Malcolm Warner, curator of the Yale Center for British Art, interpreted the work differently, writing in 1996 that \"the quiet sound of the lyre's single string is all that is left of the full music of religious faith; those who still listen are blindfolded in the sense that, even if real reasons for Hope exist, they cannot see them; Hope remains a virtue, but in the age of scientific materialism a weak and ambiguous one\"."]}]}}
