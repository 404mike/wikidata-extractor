The study looked at three athletes: Modahl, a tennis player and a jogger. All gave a urine sample when the pH level was 5, and half the sample was frozen, while the other half was stored for three days at the same temperature as the room in Lisbon where Modahl's original sample was stored (as part of the study the weather details were collected from the meteorological institute in Lisbon to recreate the conditions). The urine samples stored in elevated temperatures all measured pH 9 and all three samples showed a false positive reading for testosterone versus epi-testosterone. This evidence supported Modahl's claim of innocence and she won the appeal."]}, {"page": "Trypanosoma brucei", "response": ["* Simon Gaskell, professor of chemistry and current principal of Queen Mary, University of London, researches various forms of mass spectrometry to determine the quantity and longevity of these proteins."]}, {"page": "List of heads of member institutions of the University of London", "response": ["*Simon Gaskell"]}, {"page": "List of Principals of Queen Mary University of London", "response": ["|Simon Gaskell"]}, {"page": "Claire E. Eyers", "response": ["Following her PhD in Dundee, Eyers joined the group of Professor Natalie Ahnin the USA, and was awarded an Outstanding Postdoctoral Fellow Award (Pacific/Mountain Affiliate) of the American Heart Association (2004), held at the University of Colorado Boulder. Subsequently, in 2005, she returned to the UK to take up a position with Professor Simon Gaskell as Deputy Head of the Michael Barber Centre for Mass Spectrometry at the University of Manchester. Her work in Manchester, a national and international centre of excellence for mass spectrometry best known for the development of fast atom bombardment (FAB), involved the development, refinement and application of strategies for protein quantification by mass spectrometry, and gas-phase characterisation of modified peptides and glycans. During her time in Manchester, she also contributed to securing the first bronze (2011) and subsequently silver (2013) Athena SWAN (Scientific Women's Academic Network) award for the School of Chemistry. In 2007, Eyers was awarded a personal Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship to set up her own research proteomics laboratory, and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2010. Since 2014, she has been the Professor of Biological Mass Spectrometry in the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences at the University of Liverpool and is currently Director of the Centre for Proteome Research. She is currently Research and Impact Lead for the Institute of Integrative Biology at the University of Liverpool, a founder member of the Workload Model Working Group, which oversaw a charter Gold ranking Athena SWAN award for the IIB in 2017, a first for the University of Liverpool. Eyers sits on the Selection Committee for L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science, Professional Body Memberships and is a member of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, the British Society for Proteome Research (a member of the UK Biosciences Federation) , the British Mass Spectrometry Society and the UK Biochemical Society. Her expertise in protein phosphorylation and biological mass spectrometry have resulted in a number of professional appointments. She is currently Chair of BBSRC Committee D. Alongside Professors Sabine Flitsch and Perdita Barran, Eyers is also Co-founder and Scientific Director of Bio-Shape Ltd, a company specialising in the analysis of proteins, carbohydrates and their conjugates using mass spectrometry-based methods."]}]}}
