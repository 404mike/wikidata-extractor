Hoddle played Bodin as a more attack-minded wing back, making better use of Bodin's crossing ability. He also installed Bodin as the club's penalty taker - moves which were to come to fruition the following season, when he scored a total of twelve goals from his new position. Five of these goals came from the penalty spot - the last of which gave Swindon the lead in the dying minutes of the 1993 play-off final win over Leicester City. He was named as the club's Player of the Season for 1992\u201393. He performed well in the Premier League, scoring seven league goals, including penalty strikes against Manchester United and Arsenal as Swindon were relegated at the end of the 1993\u201394 season. He remained as John Gorman's first choice left back for two more seasons, despite a second successive relegation in 1994\u201395. He helped the club to the Second Division championship under Steve McMahon in 1995\u201396, ahead of initial first choice left-back Jason Drysdale, before leaving the club at the end of that season despite being named on the PFA Team of the Year for the second time in his career."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Jason Drysdale", "|  Jason Drysdale"]}, {"page": "Brian Drysdale", "response": ["After retiring from playing Brian Drysdale became a self-employed carpenter in Stockwood, Bristol.
