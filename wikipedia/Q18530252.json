When a dispute arose between George Blackwell, the archpriest, and a number of his clergy, who appealed against him for maladministration and exceeding his commission, Bishop and John Charnock were sent to Rome by their brethren to remonstrate against him. On their arrival they were both taken into custody by order of Cardinal Henry Cajetan, the protector of the English nation, who had been informed that they were turbulent persons and the head of a factious party.

A fleet was being assembled under Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis to attack the Spanish West Indian trade. This would adversely affect British commercial interests too, so plans were put in place to stop it.", "John Charnock describes Nevell as \"a man of approved courage, ability, and integrity, against whom the only charge the bitterest of his enemies could with propriety make, was, that he was unfortunate.\""]}, {"page": "Sir Charles Rich, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["On 28 February 1701 Rich was appointed second lieutenant of the 64-gun , transferring to the 70-gun , again as second lieutenant, on 1 December 1701.
