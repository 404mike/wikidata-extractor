Watts and Boulton gradually replaced the machinery with their own products, and in order to test the endurance they took the Caledonia on a trip to Rotterdam and up the Rhine. The sidewheeler Defiance had gone as far as Cologne in June 1816, and the Caledonia reached Koblenz in November 1817. It had, however, been necessary to use draft horses on the final part, and when the owners asked the Kingdom of Prussia for a concession for a regular service, their request was refused. Caledonia spent the winter at Rotterdam, and more machine parts were delivered from England for installation. In the spring of 1818, the sidewheeler was back on the Thames, and James Watt Junior continued his experiments, among other things varying the number of paddles on each wheel. While this was happening, the Danish solicitor, and later diplomat, Steen Andersen Bille (1781-1860), had petitioned the Danish King for the exclusive concession for a steamship connection between Copenhagen and Kiel in Holstein (then a part of the Danish Monarchy). There were two other applicants for the concession, but both withdrew, and in October 1818 Bille's concession was confirmed. He wanted to buy the Caledonia, but at the time he worked as an administrator in the Danish West Indies, so the bankers Hambro and Son in Copenhagen (later Hambros Bank in London) took care of the purchase.
