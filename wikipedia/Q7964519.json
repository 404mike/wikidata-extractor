The city\u2019s education department had decided that children with no musical training should have a chance to perform. The Manchester Children's Choir was therefore formed in 1925 by Walter Carroll, Music Advisor to Manchester Education Committee, from elementary schools in the area. Grammar school pupils were assumed to have no time to spare for non-academic endeavours such as this, which required two evenings a week rehearsal throughout the whole academic year. The choir existed from 1925 to 1939 and gave concerts, usually in local town halls, during Civic Week. The concerts with the Halle lasted from 1929 until Walter Carroll's retirement in 1935. At the time of the recording 60 boys and 190 girls from Greater Manchester schools took part. They were trained by Carroll's assistant, Gertrude Riall, who put phonetic spellings such as \"darnce\" on a board to ensure words such as \"dance\" were not sung with the local accent."]}, {"page": "List of Compositions by Walter Carroll", "response": ["Walter Carroll, Mus.

He was her first music teacher, and the original manuscript for a 1912 composition written by him for her piano lessons entitled Tunes for Ida still survives. In 1913 she moved with her family into Glenluce, a large semi-detached house in Manchester where she lived for the rest of her life. She attended Ashfield School and the Manchester High School for Girls. Beginning at the age of 16, she studied the piano at Hilda Collen's Matthay School of Music which became the Northern School of Music (NSM). She soon after took up the double bass when the school's orchestra desperately needed a player; an instrument with which she connected to later as a composer. In the mid 1950s she conducted the string orchestra at the NSM."]}]}}
