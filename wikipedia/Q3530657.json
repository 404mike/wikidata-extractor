He was born in Ipswich, Suffolk, and grew up in Cornwall with his sister Vashti Anna, two brothers, Jo Spencer and Charlie Winston, and parents Jeff and Julie Gleave (who were regulars on the folk music circuit in the late 1960s and early 1970s).  Tom and his siblings use their middle names as stage surnames.\nAfter moving to London at age 19 to attend music college, he spent many years on the gig circuit before successful residencies at Bush Hall in Shepherds Bush and The Bedford, Balham brought him to the attention of record labels.\nA self-titled EP was released by Sony Music through the Columbia Records label in May 2004 and included the tracks \"Joanna\", \"Half a Man\" and \"My Declaration\".\nHis debut album, Feather and Stone, was released by Columbia in October 2004 to critical acclaim, and was a regular on the BBC Radio 2 playlist. Singles from the album included \"This Boy\" and \"My Declaration\". The album release was followed by a headlining UK tour. He also supported Nerina Pallot on her UK tour in January 2007.\nHis second album Skybound (released 7 January 2008) was recorded independently and released on the revived Charisma Records label through EMI after he split with Sony in 2007. The first single, \"Better\", was released in January 2008 and was subsequently used on the soundtrack for the motion picture Run Fatboy Run. \"Miracle\" was used by the BBC to cover the final montage of their Olympics and Paralympics coverage. The second single was \"Tell Her Today\".\nBaxter contributed the track \"Make a Stand\" to the Survival International charity album Songs for Survival in 2008. Later that year Boyzone covered and released \"Better\", reaching number 22 in the UK Singles Chart.\nIn 2009, \"My Declaration\" was covered by Eliza Bennett and used in the soundtrack the film Inkheart (Bennett also played the female lead, Meggie Folchart, in the movie). \"Almost There\" was covered by Dame Shirley Bassey as the opening track of her album The Performance.
