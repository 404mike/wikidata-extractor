The model was proposed by Ronald Rivlin in 1948.  In contrast to linear elastic materials, the stress-strain curve of a neo-Hookean material is not linear.  Instead, the relationship between applied stress and strain is initially linear, but at a certain point the stress-strain curve will plateau.  The neo-Hookean model does not account for the dissipative release of energy as heat while straining the material and perfect elasticity is assumed at all stages of deformation."]}, {"page": "Rivlin", "response": ["* Ronald Rivlin (1915\u20132005), Anglo-American physicist, developer of the Mooney-Rivlin model for calculating the mechanical behaviour of rubber and similar materials"]}, {"page": "Mooney\u2013Rivlin solid", "response": ["In continuum mechanics, a Mooney\u2013Rivlin solidMooney, M., 1940, A theory of large elastic deformation, Journal of Applied Physics, 11(9), pp. 582\u2013592.Rivlin, R.

The model is based on Ronald Rivlin's observation that the elastic properties of rubber may be described using a strain energy density function which is a power series in the strain invariants I_1, I_2, I_3 of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensors.Rivlin, R. S., 1948, \"Some applications of elasticity theory to rubber engineering\", in Collected Papers of R. S. Rivlin vol. 1 and 2, Springer, 1997. The Yeoh model for incompressible rubber is a function only of I_1. For compressible rubbers, a dependence on I_3 is added on. Since a polynomial form of the strain energy density function is used but all the three invariants of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor are not, the Yeoh model is also called the reduced polynomial model."]}, {"page": "Gaetano Fichera", "response": ["A complete list of Fichera's friends includes some of the best scientists and mathematicians of the 20th century: Olga Oleinik, Olga Ladyzhenskaya, Israel Gel'fand, Ivan Petrovsky, Vladimir Maz'ya, Nikoloz Muskhelishvili, Ilia Vekua, Richard Courant, Fritz John, Kurt Friedrichs, Peter Lax, Louis Nirenberg, Ronald Rivlin, Hans Lewy, Clifford Truesdell, Edmund Hlawka, Ian Sneddon, Jean Leray, Alexander Weinstein, Alexander Ostrowski, Renato Caccioppoli, Solomon Mikhlin, Paul Naghdi, Marston Morse were among his friends, scientific collaborators and correspondents, just to name a few. He built up such a network of contacts being invited several times to lecture on his research by various universities and research institutions, and also participating to several academic conferences, always upon invitation. This long series of scientific journeys started in 1951, when he went to the USA together with his master and friend Mauro Picone and Bruno de Finetti in order to examine the capabilities and characteristics of the first electronic computers and purchase one for the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo: the machine they advised to purchase was the first computer ever working in Italy.
