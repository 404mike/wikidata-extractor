He played for their football team alongside such players as England internationals Walter Boyes and Bill Nicholson. By October 1942, he had been promoted from private to corporal, was playing at right half rather than inside forward, and had signed professional forms with Sunderland.

A year of so into his Sunderland career, the same correspondent described him as \"sometimes in a hurry to use the ball before he had it under control\", and feeding Johnny Spuhler with passes that were well-conceived but so overhit that \"some of them Spuhler could not reach if he had a flying start on a Spitfire\"."]}]}}
