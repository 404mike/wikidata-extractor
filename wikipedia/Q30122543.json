Price last fought at the Echo Arena in July 2013, where he lost his second consecutive fight to American veteran Tony Thompson. It was revealed that Price had parted ways with trainer Dave Coldwell and would now train with George Vaughan, Derry Mathews and Joe McNally. Price called this fight a 'make or break' for career. A day later, it was announced that he would fight journeyman Raphael Zumbano Love. Former trainer Coldwell stated based on his last conversation with Price, he had decided to retire. Coldwell wished Price well in his return. Following a hand injury suffered in training, the fight was called off. Price would next fight UK based Polish journeyman Kamil Sokolowski on 2 December 2017 at the Brentwood Centre Arena in Brentford, having last fought there in 2010. Price put on a muted performance, beating Sokolowski after six rounds. The referee scored the fight 60\u201354 in favour of Price. He stated he intentionally went the full six rounds. In the post-fight interview, Price said, \u201dHe\u2019d be a good sparring partner. I thought that was a good performance tonight. I landed most of my jabs. I want to do an 8 rounder. I must have thrown 4 punches all night with spite in it. I was boxing his face off.\u201d When asked who he would fight next, Price gave no names."]}, {"page": "List of Hamilton Academical F.C. players", "response": ["|Callum Smith||||2020\u20132021||24||2||"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Dunfermline Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| Callum Smith"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Dunfermline Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["*5 May 2017: After finishing fifth at the end of the 2016\u201317 season, manager Allan Johnston opted to offer new deals to the majority of the playing squad.
