His father, Thomas Jevons, was an iron merchant who wrote about legal and economic subjects as well. His mother Mary Anne Jevons was the daughter of William Roscoe. At the age of fifteen he was sent to London to attend the University College School. Around this time, he seemed to have formed the belief that he was capable of important achievements as a thinker. Towards the end of 1853, after having spent two years at University College, where his favourite subjects were chemistry and botany, he received an offer as metallurgical assayer for the new mint in Australia. The idea of leaving the UK was distasteful, but pecuniary considerations had, in consequence of the failure of his father's firm in 1847, become of vital importance, and he accepted the post."]}, {"page": "William Roscoe", "response": ["Roscoe and his wife had seven sons and three daughters, including William Stanley Roscoe (1782\u20131843), a poet, Thomas Roscoe (1791\u20131871), translator from Italian, and Henry (1800\u20131836), a legal writer who wrote his father's biography.
