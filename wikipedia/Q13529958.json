The scheme did not receive BR's official authorisation, but staff in station booking offices and parish councillors and commuters helped in the distribution of the cards, which had to be posted back to be recorded. In the event, 450 cards were returned and the results passed on to the local MP, Henry Kerby, who contacted Barbara Castle, Fraser's replacement as Minister of Transport. She replied on 16 March 1966 stating that she had considered the evidence and thought it was necessary to lay on extra services for passengers travelling at peak times. This would be done by varying the closure decision to include a condition that replacement bus services should be provided. Provided by Southdown Motor Services, the buses were sparsely patronised and eventually withdrawn. They had been introduced on the mistaken assumption that rail commuters would automatically switch to bus transport to travel long distances, whereas in the event only those travelling to Shoreham or Brighton used them. What actually transpired was revealed in a survey conducted in 1968, which showed that former rail users had arranged to share cars with friends or colleagues in the short term before eventually acquiring their own cars, taking early retirement or moving closer to their workplaces."]}, {"page": "Henry Briton Kerby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Kerby"]}, {"page": "1971 Arundel and Shoreham by-election", "response": ["A by-election for the United Kingdom House of Commons was held in the constituency of Arundel and Shoreham on 1 April 1971, following the death of sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Henry Kerby."]}, {"page": "Kerby (name)", "response": ["*Henry Kerby (1914\u20131971), British Conservative Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "1954 Arundel and Shoreham by-election", "response": ["The 1954 Arundel and Shoreham by-election was held on 9 March 1954.
