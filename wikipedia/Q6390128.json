It was devised by Kenneth Garside while he was deputy librarian there.  Intellectually, it was based on the close relationship between the library and the teaching departments.  The library at UCL rejected the major published classification schemes because \"none of them would generally acceptable to the teaching departments without such major modifications as would have destroyed its essential character.\" Instead, it was modeled around the \"subject reading rooms\" into which the collection had been divided.  The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme."]}]}}
