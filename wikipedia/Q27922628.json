Known as Et si je m'en vais avant toi, L'\u00e9clairage or \"the orange album\"\u2014in reference to its cover\u2014the record was released in November 1972 and promoted through the single \"La berlue\", released in June. Immediately after finishing Et si je m'en vais avant toi, Hardy and Cox recorded the English-language release If You Listen, which included cover versions of several little-known American and British songs. Hardy's Sonopresse period, which had started off well thanks to the success of Comment te dire adieu? and Soleil, ended on a sour note with the commercial failure of La question, Et si je m'en vais avant toi and If You Listen\u2014which she nevertheless considered her \"best [albums] by far\". After her contract expired, the record label decided not to renew it. The singer was relatively unbothered by the poor sales, feeling that she had been artistically vindicated with these records. ", "Hardy is known for her demanding attitude towards her music\u2014such as her decision to leave low-quality French studios to go record in London during the mid-1960s\u2014something that set her apart from her French compatriots. As she matured, Hardy honed her own despairing songwriting, but also chose with alacrity the works on offer from leading professionals.  Producer Erick Benzi recalled: \"From when she was 18, she knew she was different. She was capable of going in front of big artists like Charles Aznavour and saying, 'Your song is crap, I don't want to sing it.' She never made compromises.\" Tony Cox recalled his experience working with Hardy: \"Fran\u00e7oise was good in that she liked things to be slightly more adventurous than the norm. There was a bit of the Left Bank about her \u2013 she\u2019s not your average pop singer, that\u2019s for sure.\" She is also known for her disapproving views towards her skills as a singer and musician, telling Rock & Folk in 2018: \"I'm not a musician, that's it. By stopping to compose, I went towards ease, but also towards realism. I understood that even if I did learn things, I would never be able to do as well as real melodists. That's why I thought it was best to bring in musicians whose work touched me.\"", "Following the poor commercial performance of La question, Hardy leaned towards a more folk and rock-influenced sound.Quinonero, 2017, \"Le rouge et l'orange\" Around this time, she became an admirer of then little-known English folk singer-songwriter Nick Drake and championed his work in interviews. She recalled:  \"For me, he didn't belong to a particularly British tradition: his style was quite different from that of The Beatles, the Stones and other groups that I was listening to a lot around this time. It is the soul which comes out of his songs that touched me deeply \u2013 romantic, poetic... but also the refined melodies. As well as the very individual timbre of his voice, which adds to the melancholy of the whole thing.\" According to Tom Pinnock: \"There are certainly analogues with Nick Drake, in their personalities, voices and even a similar taste in chords and harmony.\" This led Joe Boyd to propose that the English musician write an album of songs for her, which would be produced by Tony Cox. Although Drake and Hardy met several times, including a visit to her recording sessions in London, the project was never carried out. Nevertheless, Cox was keen to work with Hardy regardless and, in late 1971, they recorded If You Listen, which featured a \"crack team\" of British folk-rock musicians. Influenced by Drake, the album showcases Hardy's taste for this musical style at the time, featuring \"cinematic\" arrangements that emphasize the acoustic guitar and light strings. The same year, she released Et si je m'en vais avant toi, also known as \"the orange album\" in reference to its cover, which incorporated influences from American blues, folk and rock music. The album features a slightly humorous tone and catchier rhythms, which were atypical for the singer."]}, {"page": "Lesley Duncan", "response": ["In 1978 Duncan married the record producer Tony Cox and they moved to the Isle of Mull, Scotland, in 1996, where most residents came to know her as a cheerful gardener and knew nothing of her previous life in the music industry. By all accounts content to lead a more private, family-oriented life in her later years, she died on 12 March 2010 of cerebrovascular disease, following an extended illness."]}, {"page": "Time and a Word", "response": ["The group continued to follow their early musical direction of performing original material and rearranged cover versions of songs by pop, jazz, and folk artists. They followed the same format as Yes: an album of eight tracks with two covers. A discussion amongst Squire, Anderson, and Colton during the writing process led to the decision of incorporating orchestral arrangements into some of their new songs. Anderson wished to use an orchestra as their new ideas needed additional sounds. He observed that Banks and Kaye had not worked together to create a strong sound that their new arrangements required. To attempt to solve this, the group discussed using a Mellotron and tested one out, but the idea fell through. Instead, a brass section of session players and a string section formed of students from the Royal College of Music were hired to perform arrangements written and conducted by Tony Cox.", "Yes premiered most of Time and a Word during their two solo concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 21 and 22 March 1970. For the second half, they played songs from the album with a twenty-piece orchestra led by Tony Cox. Anderson later considered the shows a failure, due to a lack of rehearsal time and a poor sound system. To record the orchestra, microphones were left dangling above the players using coat hangers. Banks thought the experiment was a \"daft idea\". Nevertheless, Chris Welch wrote a positive review in Melody Maker noting that despite the amplification problems, the \"musical break-through\" reaction from the audience suggested to him that the group had \"arrived\". The shows were the last in which Yes performed with an orchestra, until the 2001 Symphonic Tour to support their nineteenth studio album Magnification, which also featured orchestral arrangements.", "*Tony Cox\u00a0\u2013 orchestration, conductor"]}, {"page": "T\u00edr na n\u00d3g (band)", "response": ["Their second album A Tear and a Smile was released in 1972, and produced by  Tony Cox.

From Alan Robinson's 2004 liner notes to BGO's reissue of this and the previous album on one CD: \"..Certainly, of the three original T\u00edr na n\u00d3g albums, Strong in the Sun is by far the most conventional, most mainstream, although that's not to say that Fisher had ironed out all of the band's entertainingly whimsical rough edges.

On The Shore featured cover artwork by Storm Thorgerson of the Hipgnosis studio. Like other folk contemporaries, Trees was compared with Fairport Convention, but regarded as delivering with a more psychedelic edge. The group's material was divided between adaptations of traditional songs and original compositions, primarily by Bias Boshell.
