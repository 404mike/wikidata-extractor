Banks was born in Aston, now part of Birmingham, and joined Small Heath as a backup to goalkeeper Chris Charsley in 1889. In his first competitive game he conceded nine goals away at Sheffield Wednesday, and in his remaining three games, at the end of the 1889\u201390 season, he let in a total of nineteen. He then joined Warwick County of the Midland League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1889\u201390 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Small Heath retained most of the previous season's regular players, despite talk of \"two or three desertions that will be serious to their prospects if rumour should turn out to be correct\".Notes on Sport.

Birmingham Daily Post. p. 5. 9 December 1889. Small Heath, without Charsley, Short, Walton and Will Devey, could field only ten men for their rearranged visit to The Wednesday, top of the table and a particularly strong side at home. Jenkyns took over the captaincy, and he, Speller and reserve goalkeeper Francis Banks performed well, but the team was overwhelmed; the result, a 9\u20131 loss, in which Small Heath's only goal was scored by Wednesday's Teddy Brayshaw, remains a club record defeat.Record Results.
