He played with various local bands on the early Birmingham jazz scene before deputising with an American band at the Birmingham Palais. He toured around Europe for much of the 1920s before returning to England to play with bands led by Harry Shalson, Al Starita, Jean Pougnet, Bill Gerhardi, Percival Mackey, Arthur Lally and Lew Stone. He was Ray Noble's preferred drummer for the studio recordings he made with The New Mayfair Dance Orchestra between 1929\u20131934  In 1934, Harty also became Noble's manager, sailing to the United States with him and vocalist Al Bowlly later that year, to organise a touring band there. He remained Noble's manager and drummer into the 1950s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ray Noble", "response": ["Noble took Al Bowlly and his drummer Bill Harty to the US and asked Glenn Miller to recruit American musicians to complete the band. Miller played the trombone in the Ray Noble orchestra which performed Glenn Miller's composition \"Dese Dem Dose\" as part of the medley \"Dese Dem Dose/An Hour Ago This Minute/Solitude\" during a performance at the Rainbow Room in 1935. The American Ray Noble band had a successful run at the Rainbow Room in New York City with Bowlly as principal vocalist."]}, {"page": "Lew Stone", "response": ["In November 1933, Stone transferred his band to the Cafe Anglais and in February 1934 started a successful tour for the Mecca Agency. The band returned to the Monseigneur in March 1934 until the summer when the Monseigneur was sold to become a cinema. In September 1934, Al Bowlly and Bill Harty left to join Ray Noble in U.S. For about a year from November 1934, Stone moved to the Regal Zonophone record label, continued with theatre tours, and the band was resident for a time at the Hollywood Restaurant. Alan Kane became the main vocalist while there were also vocal contributions from band members Nat Gonella, Joe Ferrie, Tiny Winters, Joe Crossman, and American composer Al Hoffman. When Gonella left to concentrate on his own Georgians band in March 1935, trumpeter Tommy McQuater joined Stone's band. On 12 October, Stone featured Sam Browne as vocalist for the first time with \"Cheek To Cheek\" and \"Isn't This A Lovely Day?\". In November, Stone and his band returned to the Decca record label. In 1936, Stone stopped touring and formed a smaller band which opened on 30 March at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris. The band also began to broadcast regularly for commercial radio stations Radio Normandy and Radio Luxembourg. In October, Stone became musical director for the show On Your Toes (opened February 1937). The band continued at the Cafe de Paris until 31 July 1937. In September, Stone became musical director of the show Hide and Seek at the London Hippodrome, starring Cicely Courtneidge and Bobby Howes."]}, {"page": "Jazz of Birmingham", "response": ["Jazz has been popular in Birmingham since the 1920s, an era when interest in the music within England was otherwise largely confined to London. The Birmingham Palais was one of the pioneering venues of British jazz and opened in Ladywood in 1920, hosting early touring bands from the United States such as the Frisco Jazz Band in 1920, Benny Peyton's Jazz Kings in 1921, the Paramount Six and the Southern Rag-a-Jazz Orchestra in 1922, and Bill Shenkman's Buffalo Orchestra in 1923. The Palais also maintained its own resident bands that combined notable visiting American musicians such as Sidney Bechet and Emile Christian with emerging local musicians who would go on to establish the native British jazz tradition, such as Bill Harty, Billy Jones, Jack Raine, and Jack Payne."]}, {"page": "My Woman (1932 song)", "response": ["Stone and his band recorded the song in Chelsea, London, on 29 November 1932 as the last of three songs at a Decca session. It was arranged by Stone, with a trumpet solo by Nat Gonella. The other personnel in Stone's band were Alfie Noakes (trumpet), Joe Ferrie, Lew Davis (trombone), Joe Crossman, Jim Easton, Ernest Ritte (clarinet, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone), Harry Berly (clarinet, tenor saxophone, ocarina, viola), Eddie Carroll (piano), Bill Herbert (guitar), Tiny Winters (string bass) and Bill Harty (drums).Shaw, M., Rust, B. (2002). Jazz and Ragtime Records, 1897-1942: L-Z. United States: Mainspring Press. p.1635. \"My Woman\" was originally released in 1933 as the B-side to \"Junk Man Blues\", recorded at the same session. Stone's version (billed as a Fox-Trot on the label) was the only contemporary recording of the song by a British dance band."]}]}}
