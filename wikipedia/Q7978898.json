He was also one of the finest tenors of his generation and was a distinguished oratorio soloist.\nHe was a chorister at Lincoln Cathedral (1911\u20131915) and made his professional stage debut with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, where he performed from 1923 to 1927. He made his West End Debut in The Three Musketeers in 1930.  He began recording for HMV in 1929 and made over 500 solo recordings and many duet recordings with Anne Ziegler.  He and Ziegler embarked on their famous duettist variety act in 1940. They starred in three musical plays, \"The Vagabond King\" (1943), \"Sweet Yesterday\" (1945) and toured in \"And so to Bed\" (1953\u20131954) and appeared in several musical films in the 1940s. They made frequent broadcasts together. In 1948 they went on a successful concert tour of New Zealand and Australia.\nWhen musical tastes changed in the 1950s they decided to emigrate to South Africa in 1956 where they continued their stage work as well as teaching singing in their Johannesburg studio.  They returned to the United Kingdom in 1978 where they broadcast on BBC radio, appeared on television in the Russell Harty Show and made personal appearances throughout the United Kingdom in \"An Evening with Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth\".
