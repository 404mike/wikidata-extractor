He was born in Southborough, Kent and died at Winchester, Hampshire.\nHone-Goldney was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He played in a lot of minor matches at Cambridge, but had appeared in only one first-class game when picked for the University match in 1873: in this game, he batted at No 11 and bowled only two overs, without success. He made a similarly scant impression in his third and final first-class match in 1876, though the game itself, between a team called The Gentlemen of the Marylebone Cricket Club and Kent, was rendered notable by the feat of W. G. Grace in scoring 344, the highest first-class score to that point and the first innings of more than 300.", "link_mentions": {}}}
