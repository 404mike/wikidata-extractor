He was a social security adviser to Labour Secretaries of State from 1974 to 1979.  The Sun claimed he leaked the cabinet papers covering the debates about Child benefit.  In fact it was Malcolm Wicks. He claimed to have tabled more (good) amendments to Social Security legislation than anyone in history.\nHe is credited with bringing the idea of a welfare rights movement to the UK, after he visited the US. He famously attended parliamentary debates, and on the same day composed press releases at the CPAG office which he then delivered, in person, to Fleet Street - all by bicycle.He spent his years in retirement working with Southwark Pensioners Action Group, campaigning for a better deal for pensioners. He also founded Southwark Explorers Club and the Welcome Singers.He died as a result of a being knocked over by a car in Herne Hill on 11 October 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Child Poverty Action Group", "response": ["One of its first actions was to send a letter to the Prime Minister, on 22 December 1965, signed by a number of distinguished public figure, which stated:\"The signatories of this letter would probably not all agree on the precise details of a scheme for reform: we are agreed, however, that action should be taken to achieve a radical improvement in the standard of living of families in poverty and we wish to bring this memorandum to your attention. We ask that the present arrangements for family allowances and the allowances for children be reconsidered and revised, and that bigger direct allowances be paid in respect of children in the poorest families.\"Tony Lynes was the first full-time secretary of the Group in 1966.

J. M. Mackenzie. He remained there until 1953, when he took up a lectureship at the University of Toronto. Returning to England two years later, he joined the London School of Economics (LSE) as a reader (and thus Richard Titmuss's deputy as chair of social administration); in 1961, he succeeded Titmuss to the chair and became the LSE's second Professor of Social Administration. As The Scotsman summarised, Donnison was thus among a \"distinguished group of social administration experts at LSE in the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 notably Titmuss, Brian Abel-Smith, Peter Townsend, Roy Parker, John Grieve and Tony Lynes\"; with a \"profound commitment to eradicating poverty of income and opportunity, [they] had a deep and lasting influence on the development and growth of Britain's welfare state.\" Here, he focused on housing and planning; he received a major grant from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation to study the social effects of the Rent Act 1957. He wrote Housing since the Rent Act, which was published in 1961, and subsequently served on Milner Holland's Royal Commission on Housing in Greater London from 1965 and the government's Central Housing Advisory Committee. In 1967, he wrote The Government of Housing, a best-selling Pelican study which resulted from his work as a consultant to the UN Economic Commission for Europe. He also studied education and served on the Plowden Committee on Primary Education in 1967, developing the concept of Educational Priority Areas with Michael Young. From 1968 to 1970, he also chaired the Public Schools Commission, which reported on the financial state of public schools and then went on to investigate direct-grant grammar schools."]}]}}
