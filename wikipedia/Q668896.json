He also represented Scotland and the Scottish Football League XI.\nA schoolboy internationalist, Combe joined his local club Hibernian at the age of 17 from Inveresk Athletic. He was originally an inside right but dropped back to the half back line upon the formation of the Hibs Famous Five forward line, his old position taken by Bobby Johnstone. Despite operating largely in the shadows of the \"Five\", Combe enjoyed a long and successful career. He won League winners medals in 1948, 1951 and 1952. He also won one Scottish League Cup runners-up medal.\nCombe was also a Scotland internationalist, earning three caps in 1948. He made his debut in a 2\u20130 defeat by England and also appeared against Switzerland and Belgium that year, scoring against the latter. He was selected in Scotland's 22 man squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup but the Scottish Football Association only budgeted to take 13 players (including only one goalkeeper) to the finals in Switzerland. Combe was one of the nine who did not travel, along with the likes of Ernie Copland and Jimmy Binning. Inside forward George Hamilton was also on reserve, but travelled after Bobby Johnstone withdrew through injury.\nCombe retired from playing in 1957 and was appointed Hibernian's trainer. He held that role for two years before briefly becoming player-manager of Dumbarton. In his later years, Combe worked as a shopkeeper in his native Leith, then in the marketing department of Scottish Gas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["1950\u201351 was the high point of the Famous Five era.
