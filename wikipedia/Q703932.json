Graham's side featured tight defensive discipline, embodied by his young captain Tony Adams, who along with Lee Dixon, Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn, would form the basis of the club's defence for over a decade.

Arsenal needed to win by two goals to take the title; Alan Smith scored early in the second half to make it 1\u20130, but as time ticked by Arsenal struggled to get a second, and with the 90 minutes elapsed on the clock, they still needed another goal. With only seconds to go, a Smith flick-on found Michael Thomas surging through the Liverpool defence; the young midfielder calmly lifted the ball over Bruce Grobbelaar and into the net, and Arsenal were League Champions. However, there was no chance to enter the European Cup just yet for Graham's team, as the ban on English clubs in European competitions (which was imposed by UEFA in 1985 following the Heysel disaster) continued for another season.", "Graham's Arsenal became cup specialists, and in 1992\u201393 they became the first side to win the FA Cup and League Cup double, both times beating Sheffield Wednesday, 2\u20131 in the League Cup Final and 2\u20131 in the FA Cup Final replay.
