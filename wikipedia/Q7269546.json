He cites philosopher Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski and her book Virtues of the Mind in outlining intellectual virtues (such as humility, caution and carefulness) and intellectual vices (such as gullibility, carelessness and closed-mindedness). Whereas intellectual virtues help in reaching sound examination, intellectual vices \"impede effective and responsible inquiry\", meaning that those who are prone to believing in conspiracy theories possess certain vices while lacking necessary virtues."]}, {"page": "Immanuel Kant", "response": ["Prominent recent Kantians include the British philosophers P.

The 1952 printing, which did not carry these lines, can be inspected online at Internet Archive. As it appeared in print (in both 1939 and 1941) it runs, in full, as follows: \"There is an urgent need to-day,\" writes Professor Stebbing, \"for the citizens of a democracy to think well. It is not enough to have freedom of the Press and parliamentary institutions. Our difficulties are due partly to our own stupidity, partly to the exploitation of that stupidity, and partly to our own prejudices and personal desires.\" The work arose out of a synopsis she wrote for a series of radio broadcasts intended for the BBC. Published on the eve of the Second World War, Stebbing wrote in the Preface: \"I am convinced of the urgent need for a democratic people to think clearly without the distortions due to unconscious bias and unrecognized ignorance. Our failures in thinking are in part due to faults which we could to some extent overcome were we to see clearly how these faults arise.\" p.9 [1952]Chapter IV opens thus:\"Some forms of ineffective thinking are due to our not unnatural desire to have confident beliefs about complicated matters with regard to which we must take some action or other. We are sometimes too lazy, usually too busy, and often too ignorant to think out what is involved in the statements we so readily accept. ...we easily fall into the habit of accepting compressed statements which save us from the trouble of thinking. Thus arises what I shall call 'Potted Thinking'. This metaphor seems to me to be appropriate, because potted thinking is easily accepted, is concentrated in form, and has lost the vitamins essential to mental nourishment. You will notice that I have continued the metaphor by using the word 'vitamins.'  Do not accept the metaphor too hastily: it must be expanded. Potted meat is sometimes a convenient form of food; it may be tasty, it contains some nourishment. But its nutritive value is not equivalent to that of the fresh meat from which it was potted. Also, it must have originally been made from fresh meat, and must not be allowed to grow stale. Similarly a potted belief is convenient; it can be stated briefly, sometimes also in a snappy manner likely to attract attention. A potted belief should be the outcome of a belief that is not potted.  It should not be held on to when circumstances have changed and new factors have come to light. We should not allow our habits of thought to close our minds, nor rely upon catch-words to save ourselves from the labour of thinking. Vitamins are essential for the natural growth of our bodies; the critical questioning at times of our potted beliefs is necessary for the development of our capacity to think to some purpose.\" p.67\u201368 [1952]"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Quassim Cassam (born 1961)"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Philosophy, University of Cambridge", "response": ["*Quassim Cassam"]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Quassim Cassam"]}, {"page": "List of British Muslims", "response": ["* Quassim Cassam \u2013 Professor of Philosophy at the University of Warwick"]}, {"page": "List of University of Warwick people", "response": ["* Quassim Cassam - Professor of Philosophy"]}, {"page": "List of Kenyan Asian people", "response": ["* Quassim Cassam, professorhttp://www.thefreethinktank.com/interview-professor-quassim-cassam/ Interview with Prof. Cassam"]}]}}
