Appia was a scene design painter who most famously collaborated with Richard Wagner to create the sets for some of his original productions. Aided by the invention of electricity, Appia used light and shade in new ways to create the illusion of three-dimensional sets. He combined color with dynamic light intensity to create a new perspective of scene design and stage lighting. As Adolf Aber sums up, \"The whole aim of such a production is\u2014as Appia points out\u2014to get the actor, as the true bearer of the drama, back into the centre of the action.\" Appia sought to create this effect through the \"subtle art of lighting on the stage\",. His philosophy of actor-centric theater served as inspiration for Wagner's grandson Wieland Wagner when he directed Wagner's operas at the Bayreuth festival in the 1950s and 1960s. As a director, Wieland's manifestation of this philosophy birthed the theatrical aesthetic of Regieoper."]}, {"page": "Hans Schnoor", "response": [": \"How strong Riemann's beliefs since 1919, the year of his death, have been bent over with Jewish fixity, of which Alfred Einstein new editions in countless articles displays overwhelming evidence; in many cases the encyclopedia resembled a Jewish temple of fame. Now that the last possible separation between non-Jewish and Jewish in the realm of Adolf Hitler's empire was carried out in the areas of cultural, intellectual and scientific life, one might have expected a correspondingly radical departure from Einstein's editing practice in the new Riemann. But what happened? The whole of Judaism, which had settled into our culture over the past decades, has been given extensive tributes. [...] Thus stands a Herr Adolf Aber as \"DJ\" lies German Jew (!) in the new Riemann.
