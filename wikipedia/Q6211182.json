At the time of his departure, Jones was the longest serving manager in the Championship having held his post since May 2005. The club held talks with former England and Newcastle United captain Alan Shearer to replace Jones but he rejected the job despite stating that he was impressed with the \"vision, ambition and determination of the owner Dato Chan Tien Ghee and the board\". The Bluebirds instead approached Championship rivals Watford for permission to speak to their manager Malky Mackay, which was initially rejected. However, after the two clubs agreed a compensation fee, Mackay was officially appointed as Dave Jones' replacement on 17 June on a three-year contract. Mackay set about reshaping his coaching staff, allowing assistant manager Terry Burton, first-team coach Paul Wilkinson and fitness coach Alex Armstrong to leave the club, before appointing David Kerslake, Joe McBride and Richard Collinge as their replacements. Goalkeeping coach Martyn Margetson later also left the club to take up the same position at Premier League side West Ham United. Cardiff also appointed Mackay's former Watford colleague Iain Moody as their new head of recruitment."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["|First Team Coach || Joe McBride"]}, {"page": "Joe McBride (footballer born 1960)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe McBride (footballer, born 1960)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["* Joe McBride Sr., Joe McBride Jr. (son)"]}]}}
