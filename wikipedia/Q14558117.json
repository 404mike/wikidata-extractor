Murray then played at the 2019 Winston-Salem Open, where he faced Tennys Sandgren in the first round. Murray lost in straight sets, though the score was close. Murray then contemplated dropping down to Challenger level, skipping the US Open entirely to focus on two tournaments happening concurrently. Murray opted to play at the 2019 Rafa Nadal Open Banc Sabadell Challenger event, the first time he had competed on the second tier Challenger Tour since 2005. In the first round of the event, Murray defeated 17-year-old Imran Sibille in straight sets in under 43 minutes to record his first singles victory since his hip surgery. He lost to Matteo Viola in the third round."]}, {"page": "Daniel Nestor", "response": ["| Neal Skupski"]}, {"page": "ATP Awards", "response": ["| 2020 ||  Jamie Murray &  Neal Skupski"]}, {"page": "Miami Open (tennis)", "response": ["| Dan Evans   Neal Skupski"]}, {"page": "Cincinnati Masters", "response": ["| 2020 ||  Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta   Alex de Minaur ||  Jamie Murray   Neal Skupski || 6\u20132, 7\u20135"]}]}}
