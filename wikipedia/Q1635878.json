Smith and Lavington, meanwhile, remarked that Lee was \"the very incarnation of Fleming's crusty admiral.\" One American newspaper, The Spokesman-Review, described Lee as \"a real roast-beef-and-Yorkshire-pudding type of British actor.\" Murray Pomerance refers to Lee as a \"paternal actor\" in embodying this role. Terence Pettigrew, in his study British film character actors: great names and memorable moments agreed, noting that Lee was a \"gruff, reliable, no-nonsense role character actor\", with \"kindly eyes, droll manner and expressly Anglo-Saxon level-headedness\". In 1967, Lee appeared in O.K. Connery, a spoof of the James Bond film series which starred Connery's brother Neil Connery, Lois Maxwell (Miss Moneypenny), and several former actors of the series. During this period he also appeared in several ITC television productions such as The Baron, Man in a Suitcase, and Danger Man.
