Action can refer to that of a piano or other musical keyboards, including the electronic or digital stage piano and synthesizer, on which some models have \"weighted keys\", which simulate the touch and feel of an acoustic piano. The design of the key action mechanism determines the \"weighted keys\" feeling; by Tobias Matthay (1963), p. 91. that is, the feeling of the heaviness of the touch of the keys.\"A professional pianist is likely to care most about the piano's action, because that is what controls its responsiveness and relative lightness--or heaviness--of touch.
