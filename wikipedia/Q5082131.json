He served an apprenticeship as a printer and took art lessons in the evenings. He won a place at the Royal Academy in 1892 but was unable to take it up due to lack of finances.\nThe first full book he illustrated was Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses (1895) which includes over 100 pen and ink drawings. It was extremely popular, going through many reprints, and generated numerous commissions. He illustrated many fairy tales and children's books throughout his career, including Eugene Field's Lullaby Land (1897), W. E. Cule's Child Voices (1899),  Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9's Sintram and His Companions (1900), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1907), Grimm's Fairy Tales (1910), Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden (1911), and books written by Walter Copeland Jerrold and himself.\nHe was also an active painter, especially in later life, and was elected to the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1932.\nRobinson married Edith Mary Favatt in 1897 in Middlesex, England and they were the parents of four daughters and two sons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W.
