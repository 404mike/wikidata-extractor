He has been making music since 1994 and released his first album, Welcome to the Pailindrome, in 1999. Songs which he has created include \"Pat n Peg\", which turns an argument between two EastEnders characters into a track through the looping of the shouts You bitch! and You cow! and the addition of a hip hop beat, and \"Intro-Inspection\". In a 2002 front page survey of the genre, The New York Times remarked on \"Intro-Inspection\" and called Osymyso \"one of the most popular bootleg artists\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spaced", "response": ["Spaced Series 1 and 2 were both released on DVD in the United Kingdom.

The ambition of this piece would later be recalled by the British bootlegger Osymyso, whose \"Intro-Inspection\" emulates the pop-junkie feel of Plexure."]}, {"page": "Warp (record label)", "response": ["* Warp20 (Elemental): a CD album featuring an hour-long piece by Osymyso, made from sections, samples and fragments of Warp music from the previous twenty years."]}, {"page": "The Big Chill (music festival)", "response": ["2002 Enchanted Garden, Larmer Tree, Wilts: Lamb, Badmarsh and Shri, Peshay, Lambchop, Quantic, Lemon Jelly, To Rococo Rot, Pole, DJ Krush, Boomclick, Osymyso, Dominic Glynn (No Bones), Laura B."]}, {"page": "Intro-Inspection", "response": ["#REDIRECT Osymyso"]}, {"page": "Intro-Introspection", "response": ["#redirect Osymyso"]}, {"page": "Intro inspection", "response": ["#Redirect Osymyso"]}, {"page": "EastEnders theme tune", "response": ["DJ Osymyso\u2014known for remixing popular culture\u2014produced a mashup version of the theme, which turned the infamous fight between Peggy Mitchell and Pat Butcher into a breakbeat dance track. The theme was part of a routine by stand-up comedy Bill Bailey during his Bewilderness shows. Bailey describes how depressing he finds the theme and imagines lyrics he feels are fitting: \"Everyone is going to die/We're all gonna die/In a variety of different ways\". He then proceeds to supply an alternative version of the theme which he feels is more appropriate, embodying the multicultural nature of the East End of London by using mode, sitar and tabla. In 2009, American alternative metal band Faith No More performed the theme tune at the Reading and Leeds Festivals."]}, {"page": "Pure Shores", "response": ["In 2002, DJ Osymyso sampled the song on his album Intro-Inspection (2002).
