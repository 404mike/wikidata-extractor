Pressley was replaced by Chris Beech. The 2019-20 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the Cumbrians in a disappointing 18th place.  Beech then set about the task of re-building the squad following the disappointing 18th-placed finish, bringing in a raft of new signings and developing a new football system. The 2020\u201321 season started in positive fashion for the blues with the club sitting top of the table at Christmas, resulting in Beech signing a new contract extension. However a string of weather based postponements combined with COVID-19 infections throughout the squad meant that only 1 fixture was completed in 8 weeks from January until late February. The postponements meant Carlisle had to play Saturday-Tuesday every week until the end of the season, a poor run of form saw the side slip from top to 14th in the table, however results picked up towards the end of the season seeing the Cumbrians finish in 10th place.", "On 10 October 2021, manager Chris Beech was sacked due to a poor run of form for Carlisle."]}, {"page": "Rochdale A.F.C.", "response": ["On 1 June 2011 manager Keith Hill joined Championship club Barnsley.

Eyre's last game was a 0\u20130 draw against Yeovil, in which Yeovil's keeper Rene Gilmartin played the second half with a dislocated finger.

As his replacement he signed Stephen Pears from Liverpool, as well as young defenders Glen Davies and Chris McDonald, teenage winger David Clegg, Exeter City midfielder Mark Cooper, and Blackpool midfielder Chris Beech. Hartlepool started the 1996\u201397 campaign with wins over Colchester United and Fulham, but his playing career came to an end after the fifth game of the season, against Wigan Athletic, when he retired due to a persistent knee injury. He continued to bemoan refereeing decisions which seemed to consistently go against Hartlepool. This in turn led to continued punishments from the FA over his use of foul language towards officials. With his team on a poor run of results at the foot of the table, he left the club by mutual consent on 4 November 1996.
