Frederick's brother, Albert Henry Mallalieu, was head of that family of Tan-y-Marian, Llandudno.Mallalieu was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley at a by-election in 1916. He was re-elected as a Coalition Liberal at the 1918 general election, when because of his support for Lloyd George's Coalition Government, the Conservative Party did not field a candidate.\nHowever, a Conservative candidate did stand at the 1922 general election, and Mallalieu was reduced to third place, losing his seat to the Labour Party's Philip Snowden. His share of the vote had fallen from 58.8% in 1918 to only 25.1% in 1922.\nMallalieu did not stand for Parliament again, and died in 1932, aged 71.\nHe married, in 1902, Ann, daughter of Joseph Hardman; two of their sons were elected to the House of Commons:\n\nLance (born 1905) was Liberal MP for Colne Valley from 1931 to 1935, then Labour MP for Brigg from 1948 to 1974\nWilliam (born 1908) was Labour MP for Huddersfield from 1945 to 1950, then for Huddersfield East from 1950 to 1979.Sir William Mallalieu's daughter Ann has been a Labour life peer since 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*Frederick Mallalieu, MP for Colne Valley 1916\u20131922"]}, {"page": "Huddersfield New College", "response": ["* Frederick Mallalieu, Liberal MP for Colne Valley from 1916\u201322"]}, {"page": "Ann Mallalieu, Baroness Mallalieu", "response": ["Lady Mallalieu comes from a distinguished political family.
