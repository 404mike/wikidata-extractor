After working on farms he moved into newspapers, working his way up to become assistant editor of the Northern Daily Mail. As a freelance writer, his first book, Farmer's Creed, was published in 1938. This book recounted his memoirs about his time as a farm worker on Werneth Low.\nToday his work has been opened to a new audience through the show entitled In the Footsteps of Crichton Porteous, which toured widely in England, and particularly in the north-west. The show used his books to retrace some of the locations featured.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peak District", "response": ["Children's author Alison Uttley (1884\u20131976) was born at Cromford; her novel A Traveller in Time, set in Dethick, recounts the Babington Plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots from imprisonment.

Geraldine Brooks's first novel, Year of Wonders (2001), blends fact and fiction in the story of the plague village of Eyam.
