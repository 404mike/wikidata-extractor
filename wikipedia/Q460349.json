Beginning her career as an activist in the Women's Social and Political Union, Marsden eventually broke off from the suffragist organization in order to found a journal that would provide a space for more radical voices in the movement. Her prime importance lies with her contributions to the suffrage movement, her criticism of the Pankhursts' WSPU, and her radical feminism, via The Freewoman. There are those who also claim she has relevance to the emergence of literary modernism, while others value her contribution to the understanding of Egoism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 13", "response": ["*1960 \u2013 Dora Marsden, English author and activist (b. 1882)"]}, {"page": "Individualist anarchism", "response": ["This position on property is quite different from the Native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor.Weir, David.

Marsden focused the paper around the discussion of sex and the idea of being sexual, causing many issues to arise amongst readers.
