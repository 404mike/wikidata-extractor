After completing his ban, Lewington established himself as first-choice goalkeeper over Shea, recording three clean sheets in his first four matches, with teammate Damian Scannell describing him as \"the best keeper in this division in this division and the division above [League One]\". Scannell also added that Sam Walker, whose solid performance in goal for Northampton Town helped the Cobblers to a 2\u20131 win over the Daggers on 24 September, was \"not better than Chris Lewington\". John Still added that he expected a lot of interest from other clubs in his goalkeeper, following further good performances, including a second-half penalty save from Ryan Hall in their 3\u20131 defeat to the Shrimpers in the Football League Trophy on 4 October. After making 19 league appearances, Lewington signed a new three-year deal on 1 November.
