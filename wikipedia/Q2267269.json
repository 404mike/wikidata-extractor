A further inspiration for M was Maxwell Knight, the head of MI5, who signed his memos as \"M\" and whom Fleming knew well. The tradition of the head of MI6 signing their name with a single letter came from Mansfield Smith-Cumming, who would sign his initial \"C\", with green ink."]}, {"page": "MI9", "response": ["MI9 initially received little financial support and was understaffed due to power struggles and personality clashes with MI6, the \"oldest and grandest\" of the British secret services. The assistant-head of MI6 was Claude Dansey, known as ACSS.

Now a major, he returned to the War College Division in July 1915. He found that there was a general apathy about intelligence-gathering, and the MID had been downgraded from the second division of the General Staff, and merged with the third division, ending its separate identity. Van Deman wrote a history of MID detailing its beginnings in 1885, its rise in 1903, and fall in subsequent years. He was convinced that the Army must have a coordinated intelligence organization if it were to avoid defeat in the near future, especially as it was now obvious that the U.S. would soon be involved in the war in Europe. Eventually Van Deman was able to get an audience with the Secretary of War to present his case. There he convinced the War Department to accept his idea of an intelligence department for U.S. forces. A crucial role was played by Colonel Claude Dansey of the British Security Service in proposing similar ideas to Colonel Edward M. House, a member of an American liaison mission to Britain and one of President Wilson's advisors."]}, {"page": "Sigismund Payne Best", "response": ["With war looming in 1938, Best was recruited into Claude Dansey's 'Z' organization, a new branch of the SIS.

The evidence cited is that MI6's deputy leader Claude Dansey, who also had influence in MI9, opposed the execution of Cole when it was first proposed by the Pat Line. The unconfirmed claims are that Dansey placed a higher priority on preserving the intelligence gathering operations of MI6 than the escape lines and tolerated Cole's misdeeds to protect him as an MI6 agent."]}, {"page": "Christiaan Lindemans", "response": ["Christiaan Antonius Lindemans (24 October 1912 \u2013 18 July 1946) was a Dutch double agent during the Second World War, working under Soviet control.
