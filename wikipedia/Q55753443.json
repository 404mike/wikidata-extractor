Born in Dublin, he spent 33 years in industry as a chemical engineer and consultant, working overseas in the oil industry. A keen musician, Edgeworth-Johnstone developed the Johnstone flute, a simple version of the instrument made from the aluminium brass tubing used in oil refineries. The instrument's design was admired by renowned flautist James Galway, but Edgeworth-Johnstone did little with the invention until he published details in a 1993 book.\nHe later became Lady Trent Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Nottingham and was involved in reforming the courses there to be more applicable to industry. Edgeworth-Johnstone retired in 1967 but continued to work to advance engineering education, authoring a 1969 report on the subject for the Institution of Chemical Engineers. In later life he lived in Brighton, where he represented the county of Sussex in pistol shooting, before moving to France, where he died at Parc\u00e9-sur-Sarthe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of University of Nottingham people", "response": ["* Robert Edgeworth-Johnstone - first Lady Trent professor of chemical engineering"]}, {"page": "1900 in Ireland", "response": ["* 4 February \u2013 Robert Edgeworth-Johnstone, chemical engineer (died 1994 in France)"]}, {"page": "Walter Edgeworth-Johnstone", "response": ["In 1897, Edgeworth-Johnstone married Helen Gunning Walker Waters.
