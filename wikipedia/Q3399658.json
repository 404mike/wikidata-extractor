Although an Englishman by birth, he developed a lifelong interest in the history and genealogy of the royal families and nobility of mediaeval Wales. He learned to read the Welsh language and went on to publish a compendious series of volumes containing the edited texts of medieval Welsh genealogical tracts and his own detailed reconstructions of family lines. His work is now an essential resource for any serious student of early and medieval Welsh history.\nMuch of his work has been made available online.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cunedda", "response": ["Cunedda and his forebears led the Votadini against Pictish and Irish incursions south of Hadrian's Wall. Sometime after this, the Votadini troops under Cunedda relocated to North Wales to defend the region from Irish invasion, specifically the U\u00ed Liath\u00e1in, as mentioned in the Historia Brittonum. Cunedda established himself in Wales, in the territory of the Venedoti, which would become the centre of the kingdom of Gwynedd. Two explanations for these actions have been suggested: either Cunedda was acting under the orders of Maximus (or Maximus's successors) or Vortigern, the high king of the British in the immediate post-Roman era. The range of dates (suggested by Peter Bartrum) runs from the late 370s, which would favour Maximus, to the late 440s, which would favour Vortigern."]}, {"page": "Battle of Camlann", "response": ["Camlann is mentioned in Peniarth MS.37, a 14th-century copy of the Gwentian code of the Cyfraith Hywel (Welsh law), which (according to Peter Bartrum) shows that it was a topic familiar to Welsh writers. The law states \"when the queen shall will a song in the chamber, let the bard sing a song respecting Camlan, and that not loud, lest the hall be disturbed.\" The 15th/16th-century poet Tudur Aled says that the battle came about through the treachery of Medrod and happened \"about two nuts\".Bartrum, Peter C., A Welsh classical dictionary : people in history and legend up to about A.D. 1000, The National library of Wales, 1993, pp. 109-111.

Cynlas appears in the genealogies of the kings of Rhos, in Gwynedd, as a son of Owain Danwyn and a father of Maig. The relationship is attested in the Harleian genealogies (HG), the Genealogies from Jesus College MS 20 (JC), and the Achau Brenhinoedd a Thywysogion Cymru (ABT). However the JC disagrees with the other sources on the exact relationship between the three men. Cynlas' cognomen, \"Goch\", is only mentioned in the ABT.

Bartrum explains (p.\u00a0130) that around the year 1400 the monks of Glastonbury adapted the lineage of the Vulgate Quest's Grail Kings to descend from Enigeus (sister of Joseph of Arimathea) down to Lambor, father of the Maimed King, who in this account fathers an unnamed son who is in turn the father of Arthur's mother Eigr or Ygerne. Bartrum points out that later Welsh texts adapted this genealogy, replacing the word filius (\u2018son\u2019), which stood for the unnamed son, with Amlawdd Wledig."]}, {"page": "Bartrum, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Bartrum"]}]}}
