Ferdinand Foch, or \"Marshal Foch\", was supreme commander of Allied forces from April 1918 onwards. The chair was endowed by an arms trader, Basil Zaharoff, in Foch's honour; he also endowed a post in English Literature at the University of Paris in honour of the British Field Marshal Earl Haig. Zaharoff wanted the University of Paris to have a right of veto over the appointment, but Oxford would not accept this. The compromise reached was that Paris should have a representative on the appointing committee (although this provision was later removed). In advance of the first election, St\u00e9phen Pichon (the French Foreign Minister) unsuccessfully attempted to influence the decision.  The first professor, Gustave Rudler, was appointed in 1920. , the chair is held by Catriona Seth.  The position is held in conjunction with a Fellowship of All Souls College."]}]}}
