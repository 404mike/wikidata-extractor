In a first-class career that lasted from 1888, when he was 18, till 1928, when he was 58, he also played cricket for Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present (1890), fifteen matches for The Gentlemen (1891\u20131906), North of England (1891\u20131908), Gentlemen of England (1891\u20131910) and  C. I. Thornton's XI (1892\u20131899) and, among other teams, twenty-seven games for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI (1909\u20131928).In 242 first-class matches, Smith scored 7,686 runs at 21.46, with a highest score of 164 not out for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI against Cambridge University in 1912. In 1891 he scored 154 for North against South, he and Charles de Trafford adding 254 in 105 minutes. A right-arm fast bowler, Smith took 454 wickets at 25.69, with a best return of 7 for 40 for Yorkshire against MCC in 1893. For Oxford University in 1890 he took 13 for 146 in the match against Lancashire. Standing six feet one inch tall, he was also a good fieldsman.Smith was a schoolteacher who played most of his cricket during the summer school holidays. In 1958 A. A. Thomson said of him: \"Ernest was one of that devoted band of August schoolmasters \u2013 happily they survive to-day \u2013 who pack their boys off home and add a kind of academic gaiety to the month's cricket.\" He added that Smith could \"defend like a lowered portcullis if Yorkshire were in serious trouble\" or bat \"like a charging cavalry leader\".Smith died in April 1945 in Eastbourne, Sussex. His brother, A. E. Smith, played one first-class game for the \"English Residents\" in Philadelphia in 1890.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["Although some people assumed that Hawke had turned his back on Yorkshire, he returned with new vigour in 1886 to begin what he himself referred to as his consistent association with the county. While Hawke had formerly been the figurehead who tossed the coin, he now took complete charge of operations and began the transformation of the team in earnest.Coldham, p. 47. The team that Hawke inherited from Emmett, which Hawke referred to as \"the boys of my old brigade\", was in decline by 1886 and several players would retire or be dismissed during the next couple of years so that, by the end of the 1887 season, it was clear that Yorkshire faced what Coldham called \"a protracted period of rebuilding\".Coldham, p. 59. Within the next seasons, the likes of Ted Peate, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Louis Hall and George Ulyett had all retired. Left arm spinner Bobby Peel, wicket-keeper David Hunter, all-rounder George Hirst, opening batsman Jack Brown and the amateurs Stanley Jackson and Ernest Smith were among the replacements who formed Yorkshire's successful teams of the 1890s and 1900s.Hodgson, p. 53."]}, {"page": "Ernest Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["Ernest Smith (1914\u20132005) was a Canadian soldier and recipient of the VC.", "Ernest Smith may also refer to:", "*Ernest Smith (artist) (1907-1975), native American artist", "*Ernest Smith (baseball) (1908\u2013?), Negro league baseball player", "*Ernest Smith (boxer) (1912\u2013?), Irish Olympic boxer", "*Ernest Smith (cricketer, born 1869) (1869\u20131945), English cricketer", "*Ernest Smith (cricketer, born 1888) (1888\u20131972), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Ernest Smith (1869)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ernest Smith (cricketer, born 1869)"]}, {"page": "John Frazer (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1924, as a postgraduate student with more time, Frazer finally played first-class cricket for Oxford University. He played in most of the team matches in the 1924 season, batting mainly in the middle order, but his best score and his only total ever of more than 50 was made as an opening batsman, with 81 in the match against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Eastbourne, a rather weak team composed entirely of amateurs, many of them not in the first flush of youth (Ernest Smith, the captain, was 54 and had played for Oxford University 36 years earlier in 1888). Frazer's timing for a big innings was immaculate: the next Oxford game was the University Match and he duly won a cricket blue to go with his two soccer blues, scoring 5 and 20 in his two innings in a nine-wicket defeat by Cambridge. Frazer played seven further matches for Sussex when the university term was over, without success, and appeared for two amateur teams in first-class matches against Oxford University in 1925, but that was the end of his first-class cricket career."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Ernest Smith (1891\u20131906)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Ernest Smith (1892\u20131902) : E.
