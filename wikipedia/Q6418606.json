Seen as a high flier, she went on to serve as a minister in Gordon Brown's government from 2007 to 2009, mainly at the Treasury, but also at the Department for Work and Pensions, having previously been a Special Advisor at the Department for Trade and Industry. At the time she was the second-youngest government minister, and the youngest woman.\nUssher resigned from her ministerial role in 2009 following her involvement in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal in which it was reported she had taken action on the advice of her accountants to reduce her  capital gains tax liability. She did not stand at the 2010 election, citing the desire for a more normal family life while her children were young. Since then, she has worked primarily in public policy thought leadership, at Demos and as Managing Director of Tooley Street Research. In August 2021, she predicted that unemployment would not rise when the coronavirus furlough scheme ended at the end of the following month. At the time this was out of step with most economic forecasts however, when the official ONS data was released four months later, her prediction was shown to be correct.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 18", "response": ["*  1971   \u2013 Kitty Ussher, English economist and politician"]}, {"page": "Virginia Bottomley", "response": ["Julia Cleverdon married Bottomley's late father, John.Davidson, Andrew (2007), \"The MT interview: Julia Cleverdon\" , Management Today, 28 September 2007; retrieved 3 January 2011.

Originally Hall Royd Junction was triangular, and the lifted curve allowed services from Burnley to reach Manchester via Todmorden (regular services over it had ceased in November 1965). Reinstating the curve was a priority for Lancashire County Council and was ranked as the most important project in its 2010 Rail Improvement Schemes draft report. The government stated in March 2010 that reinstating the link would cost around \u00a37\u00a0million and any new rail services would require initial subsidy. Burnley MP Kitty Ussher wrote to the North West Development Agency to seek assurance that it could find the money. In October 2010 Network Rail agreed to pay for the final assessment of the plans. This assessment, completed in May 2011, concluded that it could be feasible to reinstate the curve, although the original route could not be used as the original curve was deemed to be too sharp. An alternative route was instead put forward, and it was stated that, if funds could be obtained by early 2012 to carry forward the project, the curve could be back in use by the end of 2013."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Burnley || Kitty Ussher || Labour || Peter Pike || Labour"]}, {"page": "Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Burnley saw strong opposition support for the Liberal Democrats in 2005 who moved into second place; meanwhile a local independent pushed Yousuf Miah, a Conservative into fourth position.
