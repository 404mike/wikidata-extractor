Half a century later, in 1427, a captain sailing for Prince Henry the Navigator, possibly Gon\u00e7alo Velho, may have rediscovered the Azores, but this is not certain. In Thomas Ashe's 1813 work, A History of the Azores, the author identified a Fleming, Joshua Vander Berg of Bruges, who made landfall in the archipelago during a storm on his way to Lisbon. He stated that the Portuguese explored the area and claimed it for Portugal. Other stories note the discovery of the first islands (S\u00e3o Miguel, Santa Maria and Terceira) by sailors in the service of Henry the Navigator, although there are few documents to support the claims."]}, {"page": "American literature", "response": ["Back then, some of the American literature were pamphlets and writings extolling the benefits of the colonies to both a European and colonial audience.
