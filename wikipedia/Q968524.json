He has won four Grammy Awards, for Producer of the Year and Album of the Year for 1985, Record of the Year for 1990, and Engineer of the Year for 1993. A 1992 poll in Mix magazine voted him one of the world's \"Top Ten Most Influential Producers\". Padgham's co-productions include hits by Phil Collins, XTC, Genesis, the Human League, Sting, and the Police. He pioneered (with Peter Gabriel and producer Steve Lillywhite) the \"gated reverb\" drum sound used most famously in Collins' song \"In the Air Tonight\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheryl Crow", "response": ["In 1992, Crow recorded her first attempt at a debut album with Sting's record producer Hugh Padgham. The self-titled debut album was due to be released in September 1992, but Crow and her label mutually decided that the album did not merit release. Crow described it as \"too produced\" and \"slick\". However, a handful of cassette copies of the album were leaked, along with press folders for album publicity. This album has been widely dispersed via file sharing networks and fan trading. In the meantime, Crow's songs were recorded by major artists such as Celine Dion, Tina Turner and Wynonna Judd."]}, {"page": "XTC", "response": ["XTC were impressed by Steve Lillywhite's work on Ultravox's 1977 debut, and Siouxsie and the Banshees The Scream, and he was contacted to produce their third album with a drum sound that would \"knock your head off\". With engineer Hugh Padgham, the band embarked to the newly built Townhouse Studios, \"with its now world-famous stone room\"; Gregory later recalled that Padgham had \"yet to develop his trade-mark 'gated ambience' sound\". Coinciding with Gregory's arrival, the band recorded \"Life Begins at the Hop\" (1979), a Moulding composition. By this time, Moulding \"wanted to ditch [our] quirky nonsense and do more straight-ahead pop.\" He was surprised to learn that the label chose his song as a single over Partridge's. Upon release, it was the first charting single for the band, rising to number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. For a period, most of the group's singles were not placed on their albums. Moulding explained that this was because of an industry convention in the 1960s and the 1970s, and that when \"we wanted to shift albums later on, that approach got blown out of the water.\""]}, {"page": "Genesis (band)", "response": ["In November 1980, Genesis bought Fisher Lane Farm, a farmhouse with an adjoining cowshed near Chiddingfold, Surrey, as their new rehearsal and recording facility. The building was remodelled into a studio in four months before recording for Abacab began in March 1981. The new environment had a productive effect on the writing process as the band wrote enough for a double album, but they discarded one hour's worth of songs that sounded too similar to their past albums. Banks said the band made an effort to keep melodies as simple as possible, which signalled further changes in their direction. The shift was underlined in its production when Hentschel, their producer and engineer since 1975, was replaced by Hugh Padgham after Collins liked his production on Face Value and Gabriel's third solo album. Production duties were solely credited to the band for the first time with Padgham as their engineer. The album is formed of group written material with an individual song from each member. \"No Reply at All\" features the Phenix Horns, the horn section of American band Earth, Wind & Fire."]}, {"page": "The Police", "response": ["The Police's fourth album, Ghost in the Machine, co-produced by Hugh Padgham, was recorded at Air Studios on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, with the exception of \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" which was recorded at Le Studio at Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada, and released in 1981. It featured thicker sounds, layered saxophones, and vocal textures. It spawned the hit singles \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" (featuring pianist Jean Roussel), their fourth UK No. 1 (No. 3 in the U.S.), \"Invisible Sun\", and \"Spirits in the Material World\".Whitburn, Joel (2004).

As the band was unable to agree on a cover picture, the album cover had three red pictographs, digital likenesses of the three band members in the style of segmented LED displays, set against a black background. In the 1980s, Sting and Summers became tax exiles and moved to Ireland (Sting to Roundstone, County Galway, and Summers to Kinsale in County Cork) while Copeland, an American, remained in England. The group opened and closed the 1981 concert film, Urgh! A Music War. The film, which captured the music scene in the wake of punk, was masterminded by Stewart Copeland's brothers Ian and Miles. The film had a limited release but developed a mythic reputation over the years."]}, {"page": "Melissa Etheridge", "response": ["In January 1993, Etheridge came out publicly as a lesbian.

He signed with Virgin Records and WEA for American distribution in order to distance himself from the Charisla label, and oversaw every stop of its production; he wrote the liner notes himself and by hand. His divorce was the focus of its lyrical themes and song titles: \"I had a wife, two children, two dogs, and the next day I didn't have anything. So a lot of these songs were written because I was going through these emotional changes.\" Collins produced the album in collaboration with Hugh Padgham, with whom he had worked on Peter Gabriel's self-titled 1980 album. Face Value reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was also an international success, reaching number one in six other countries and number seven in the US where it went on to sell 5 million copies. \"In the Air Tonight\", the album's lead single, became a hit and reached number two in the UK charts. The song is known for the gated reverb effect used on Collins's drums, a technique developed by Padgham when he worked as an engineer on Gabriel's song \"Intruder\", on which Collins played drums."]}, {"page": "The Age of Plastic", "response": ["The Age of Plastic was afforded a budget of \u00a360,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ).

Padgham reportedly had a much more relaxed style than Tickle which the Enz found ideally suited them.
