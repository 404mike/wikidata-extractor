He was born in Doxey, Staffordshire and died at Harpole, Northamptonshire.\nGobey played in second eleven cricket for Warwickshire in the 1930s as an amateur left-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler, but his only first-class cricket came in two matches inside a week in the difficult 1946 season, when Warwickshire lacked players because of slow demobilisation after the Second World War; he was not successful in either game, scoring only two runs in three innings and failing to take a wicket in his two overs of bowling.", "link_mentions": {}}}
