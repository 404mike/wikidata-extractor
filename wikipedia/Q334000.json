Now known as Margaret Ewing, she was selected by the SNP as their candidate for Moray at the 1987 election. She was re-elected to Westminster and again in 1992 and 1997, holding this seat until standing down at the 2001 general election to concentrate on Holyrood. She stood for the leadership of the SNP in 1990 but lost out to Alex Salmond despite the backing of many prominent SNP members (such as Jim Sillars). Ewing had become leader of the SNP's parliamentary group after the 1987 election. The leadership vacancy was caused by the fact that the SNP Chairman Gordon Wilson had lost his seat at Dundee Dundee East and previous group leader Donald Stewart had retired from parliament. While, the three SNP MPs elected in 1987 had not been members of the previous parliament, both Ewing and Andrew Welsh had served in parliament in the past. A post-election meeting held at Perth between Ewing, Welsh, Salmond (newly elected as MP for Banff and Buchan) and Wilson led to Ewing's appointment with Welsh becoming the group's chief whip."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Andrew Welsh"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Andrew Welsh"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Andrew Welsh"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Andrew Welsh"]}, {"page": "Andrew Welsh", "response": ["*Andrew Welsh (politician) (1944\u20132021), Scottish politician", "*Andrew Welsh (footballer) (born 1983), Australian rules footballer"]}, {"page": "North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"3\"|Andrew Welsh(SNP)"]}, {"page": "Catherine Stihler", "response": ["Whilst a student at St Andrews, she was elected president of the Students' Association, serving from 1994\u201395.
