Since 1992, he has concentrated on reviving his original career as an actor, although he also freelanced as an announcer for Westcountry Television in Plymouth during the mid-late 1990s.\nAs an actor, Elsmore has played parts in various films and television series including The Bill, Lovejoy, The Governor, Casualty and Doctors.\nWhile working for Thames, he also made cameo and guest appearances in networked productions such as Rainbow, Pauline's Quirkes, The Kenny Everett Video Cassette and Eric & Ernie's Christmas Show, often parodying his role as a continuity announcer. In the case of the latter, he holds the distinction of appearing in Morecambe and Wise's last TV sketch.He has also written and directed for the stage, and still works providing voice-overs for various DVD and video releases. In 2006 he provided the narration for English electronic group Mordant Music's album Dead Air.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "ITV Emergency National Service", "response": ["The announcing team for the special service was mainly David Hamilton, John Benson, Sheila Kennedy and Philip Elsmore, who would all continue as Thames announcers when the regional services restarted at the end of the strike.Beaumont, Ian No Logo  Inside TV, 1 January 2002, accessed 1 June 2006"]}, {"page": "Elsmore", "response": ["* Philip Elsmore"]}, {"page": "Phillip Elsmore", "response": ["#redirect Philip Elsmore "]}, {"page": "List of continuity announcers in the United Kingdom", "response": ["| Jill Bechley, John Benson (1957\u20131966), Sidonie Bond, John Braben, John Duncanson, John Edmunds, Philip Elsmore, David Hamilton, Sheila Kennedy, Keith Martin, John McGavin, Mel Oxley, Owen Oyston, Bill Steel (1967\u20131968), Juliet Stevens,Clifford Swindells ", "| Michael Alexander, Philip Ashley, Greg Bance, John Benson, Guy Blackmore, Sidonie Bond, Peter Brook, Jane Criddle, John Crosse, Ian Curry, Richard Davies, Clifford Earl, Adrian Edwards (1976\u20131980), Tom Edwards, Philip Elsmore, Su Evans,Bill Flynn, Liz Fox, Sharon Gray, David Hamilton, Gill Hewitt, Aline James, Lesley Judd, Martin King, Peter Marshall, Keith Martin (1958\u20131981), Verity Martindill, John McGavin, Diana Moran, Martin Muncaster (1958\u20131960), Brian Nissen (1958\u20131981),Meryl O'Keefe (1958\u20131960), Mel Oxley, Julian Peffier, Simon Prebble, Mike Prince, Christopher Robbie, Peter Shoesmith, Clifford Swindells, Vanessa Thornton, Nicholas Tresillian, Christine Webber, Colin Weston, Stewart White, Muriel Young", "| John Benson, Guy Blackmore, Victoria Crawford (1986\u20131989), Tom Edwards, Philip Elsmore (1968\u20131992), Evande Fisher (mid-1980s\u20131991), David Hamilton (1968\u20131982), Gill Hewitt, Hilary Holden (1980s), Bob Holness, Robin Houston (1978\u20131992), John Jason, Sheila Kennedy, Mark Lipscomb (1980s\u20131992), Mark Longhurst, Sarah Lucas (late 1970s-early 1980s), Peter Marshall (1976\u20131992), Sally McLaren (mid-late 1980s), Jenny Ogwen, Denise Palmer, Laura Penn (1989\u20131990), Mike Prince, Christopher Robbie, Bill Steel, Lorana Stevens, Vivien Stuart, Patricia Yorston (1980s)", "| Trish Bertram, Malcolm Brown, Philip Elsmore (1993-1999), Peter Griffin (1993\u20132002), Bruce Hammal, Chris Langmore (1994\u20132002), Lorna Stevens (1993\u20131994), Roger Tilling (1996\u20131997)"]}]}}
