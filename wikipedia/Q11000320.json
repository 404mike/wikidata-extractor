He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler. He was born in South Bermondsey and died in Stockwell, London. His brother Tom Abel and father, the England and Surrey batsman Bobby Abel, were also first-class cricketers.His last appearance in the County team was in 1926 and, after a few games with the Second Eleven, he joined Accrington, the Lancashire League Club. A batsman of the unorthodox school, Abel was a pleasing, forcing player and, even though he never gained the distinction of obtaining a century in County Championship matches, he put together many useful scores. Abel won his Surrey cap in 1910 and scored his only first-class hundred, 117, against Cambridge University in 1923. He took five wickets in an innings three times, with a best of 5 for 28 against Middlesex.His best season was 1923 when he had an aggregate of 957, while in 1914--when Surrey won the County Championship--he hit up 524 runs in sixteen County games with a highest score of 87. As a bowler, Abel began as fast-medium, but lessening his pace he exploited the leg-break and the googly. In his most successful season as a bowler 1919, he took thirty-seven wickets. He was a first-rate slip fielder. After serving in the First World War, Abel did not enjoy good health.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abel (surname)", "response": ["* William Abel (1887\u20131934), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Tom Abel (cricketer)", "response": ["He was the son of Bobby Abel, the Surrey and England cricketer and the brother of William Abel who played for Surrey between 1909 and 1926."]}, {"page": "Jim Cutmore", "response": ["Cutmore was born in Walthamstow, Essex (now in the London Borough of Waltham Forest). He made his Essex debut on 5 July 1924 in a home match against Surrey in the 1924 County Championship; coming in at number 7, he made 18 runs in the first innings and 29 in the second, as well as taking the second-innings wicket of William Abel with one of the four balls he bowled in the innings; Surrey won the match by 5 wickets. As his career continued, Cutmore rose up the Essex batting line-up, even opening the innings on occasion; in 1927, he opened the batting in an away match against Gloucestershire at Greenbank and went on to make his career best score of 238 not out before Essex declared on 578/6. By the end of his career, Cutmore had settled near the top of the middle-order. His final appearance came on 17 June 1936, away to Yorkshire; with Essex batting second, Cutmore came in at number 3 and made 21 runs before being trapped LBW by Bill Bowes; in the second innings, he opened the batting, but this time made only 13 runs before he was caught by Arthur Mitchell off the bowling of Hedley Verity."]}, {"page": "Abel, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Abel"]}]}}
