T. Wright or Tom Wright, is an English New Testament scholar, Pauline theologian and Anglican bishop. He was the bishop of Durham from 2003 to 2010. He then became research professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at St Mary's College in the University of St Andrews in Scotland until 2019, when he became a senior research fellow at Wycliffe Hall at the University of Oxford.Wright writes about theology and Christian life and the relationship between them. He advocates a biblical re-evaluation of theological matters such as justification, women's ordination, and popular Christian views about life after death. He has also criticised the idea of a literal Rapture. The author of over seventy books, Wright is highly regarded in academic and theological circles for his \"Christian Origins and the Question of God\" series. The third volume, The Resurrection of the Son of God, is considered by many clergy and theologians to be a seminal Christian work on the resurrection of Jesus, while the most recently released fourth volume, Paul and the Faithfulness of God, is hailed as Wright's magnum opus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "And did those feet in ancient time", "response": [" Another interpretation, amongst Nonconformists, is that the phrase refers to the established Church of England.

According to the \"New Religionsgeschichtliche Schule\",Larry Hurtado (10 July 2015), \"Early High Christology\": A \"Paradigm Shift\"? \"New Perspective\"? c.q. \"Early High Christology Club\", which includes Martin Hengel, Larry Hurtado, N. T. Wright, and Richard Bauckham, this \"incarnation Christology\" or \"high Christology\" did not evolve over a longer time, but was a \"big bang\" of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul. Some 'Early High Christology' proponents scholars argue that this \"high Christology\" may go back to Jesus himself.Larry Hurtado, \"The Origin of 'Divine Christology'?\"", "There is a controversy regarding whether Jesus himself claimed to be divine. In Honest to God, then-Bishop of Woolwich John A. T. Robinson, questioned the idea.Robinson, John A. T. (1963), Honest to God, page 72. John Hick, writing in 1993, mentioned changes in New Testament studies, citing \"broad agreement\" that scholars do not today support the view that Jesus claimed to be God, quoting as examples Michael Ramsey (1980), C. F. D. Moule (1977), James Dunn (1980), Brian Hebblethwaite (1985) and David Brown (1985).Hick, John, The Metaphor of God Incarnate, page 27. \"A further point of broad agreement among New Testament scholars ... is that the historical Jesus did not make the claim to deity that later Christian thought was to make for him: he did not understand himself to be God, or God the Son, incarnate. ... such evidence as there is has led the historians of the period to conclude, with an impressive degree of unanimity, that Jesus did not claim to be God incarnate.\" Larry Hurtado, who argues that the followers of Jesus within a very short period developed an exceedingly high level of devotional reverence to Jesus, at the same time rejects the view that Jesus made a claim to messiahship or divinity to his disciples during his life as \"naive and ahistorical\". According to Gerd L\u00fcdemann, the broad consensus among modern New Testament scholars is that the proclamation of the divinity of Jesus was a development within the earliest Christian communities.Gerd L\u00fcdemann, \"An Embarrassing Misrepresentation\", Free Inquiry, October / November 2007. \"...\u00a0the broad consensus of modern New Testament scholars that the proclamation of Jesus's exalted nature was in large measure the creation of the earliest Christian communities.\" N. T. Wright points out that arguments over the claims of Jesus regarding divinity have been passed over by more recent scholarship, which sees a more complex understanding of the idea of God in first century Judaism. But Andrew Loke argues that if Jesus did not claim and show himself to be truly divine and rise from the dead, the earliest Christian leaders who were devout ancient monotheistic Jews would have regarded Jesus as merely a teacher or a prophet, but not as truly divine, which they did.Andrew Ter Ern Loke, The Origin of Divine Christology (Cambridge University Press, 2017), pp. 100\u2013135"]}, {"page": "December 1", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 N.

In fact, if they had made the story up, they would have had strong motivation to make Peter, Jesus's closest disciple while he was alive, the discoverer of the tomb instead. He also says that the story of Mary Magdalene discovering the empty tomb is independently attested in the Synoptics, the Gospel of John, and in the Gospel of Peter. N. T. Wright states that \"it is, frankly, impossible to imagine that [the women at the tomb] were inserted into the tradition after Paul's day.\""]}, {"page": "New International Version", "response": ["In 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured what Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to Protestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly, relies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was talking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans.\"In this context, I must register one strong protest against one particular translation. When the New International Version was published in 1980, I was one of those who hailed it with delight. I believed its own claim about itself, that it was determined to translate exactly what was there, and inject no extra paraphrasing or interpretative glosses. This contrasted so strongly with the then popular New English Bible, and promised such an advance over the then rather dated Revised Standard Version, that I recommended it to students and members of the congregation I was then serving. Disillusionment set in over the next two years, as I lectured verse by verse through several of Paul's letters, not least Galatians and Romans. Again and again, with the Greek text in front of me and the NIV beside it, I discovered that the translators had another principle, considerably higher than the stated one: to make sure that Paul should say what the broadly Protestant and evangelical tradition said he said. I do not know what version of scripture they use at Dr Piper's church. But I do know that if a church only, or mainly, relies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was talking about.\"  In support of this claim, Wright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do not convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or reflect his own thinking about the pistis Christou debate. All editions of the NIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's specific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to the 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus Christ\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans 3:22."]}, {"page": "Predestination", "response": ["Biblical scholar N. T. Wright argues that Josephus's portrayal of these groups is incorrect, and that the Jewish debates referenced by Josephus should be seen as having to do with God's work to liberate Israel rather than philosophical questions about predestination. Wright asserts that Essenes were content to wait for God to liberate Israel while Pharisees believed Jews needed to act in cooperation with God. John Barclay responded that Josephus's description was an over-simplification and there were likely to be complex differences between these groups which may have been similar to those described by Josephus. Francis Watson has also argued on the basis of 4 Ezra, a document dated to the first century AD, that Jewish beliefs in predestination are primarily concerned with God's choice to save some individual Jews."]}, {"page": "Resurrection of Jesus", "response": ["The English theologian and historian N.

Wright, however, emphatically and extensively argues for the reality of the empty tomb and the subsequent appearances of Jesus, reasoning that as a matter of history both a bodily resurrection and later bodily appearances of Jesus are far better explanations for the rise of Christianity than are any other theories, including those of Ehrman. Dale Allison has also argued for an empty tomb, that was later followed by visions of Jesus by the Apostles and Mary Magdalene.", "For Christians, including some scholars, the resurrection is taken to have been a concrete, material resurrection. According to N. T. Wright in his book The Resurrection of the Son of God, \"There can be no question: Paul is a firm believer in bodily resurrection.

Wright also define evil in terms of effect saying an \"...act is objectively good (or bad) if it is good (or bad) in its consequences\". Hinduism defines evil in terms of its effect saying \"the evils that afflict people (and indeed animals) in the present life are the effects of wrongs committed in a previous life.\" Some contemporary philosophers argue a focus on the effects of evil is inadequate as a definition since evil can observe without actively causing the harm, and it is still evil."]}, {"page": "Religion and sexuality", "response": ["New Testament scholar N.
