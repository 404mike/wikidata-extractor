He played first-class cricket for Somerset in four matches in the 1921 season and a further four in the 1923 season. He was born in Bath, Somerset and died there as well.\nWhiting was an amateur right-handed batsman and leg-break bowler. In his eight matches for Somerset he batted in both the middle order and at the tail-end; as a bowler, he took at least one wicket in every opposition innings in the games he played. In his first game against Middlesex, he shared the first innings wickets with Jack White and then took the only two wickets to fall in the second innings. His figures of four for 28 remained the best of his first-class career, and his second innings of 28, when he top-scored for Somerset, was also his highest first-class score. Whiting played three further matches in 1921. His first match on his return in 1923, against Warwickshire, saw him take seven wickets, with four for 55 in the Warwickshire second innings. But after three further matches, his first-class career was over.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Walter Whiting (1921\u20131923) 8 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Whiting (surname)", "response": ["*Walter Whiting (1888\u20131952), English cricketer"]}]}}
