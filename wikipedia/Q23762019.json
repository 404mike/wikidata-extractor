Bernard is a British historian who specializes in the reign of King Henry VIII, specifically the English Reformation of the 1530s \u2013 both in England and globally \u2013 and the \"reign\" of Anne Boleyn. He is most famous for his arguments for the strength of Henry VIII as a ruler not controlled by faction, and for his theory that Anne Boleyn was guilty of adultery in 1536, based on a poem by Lancelot de Carles. He is commonly juxtaposed with David Starkey and Eric Ives, who have forcefully presented opposing arguments. Bernard's willingness to defend unpopular positions has been noted both by his admirers and his critics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reading School", "response": ["|George W.

She suggested that Ives's theory on Anne's fall (that it was caused by foreign policy and palace politics) was based on an over-reliance on Spanish sources and that his theory on her youth was ridiculous.

Until recently it was generally accepted that Lancelot de Carle was not present at Anne Boleyn's trial and execution, but that another Frenchman, Crispin de Milherve was an eyewitness. In The Sunday Times review: The Lady in the Tower: The Fall of Anne Boleyn by Alison Weir 1 November 2009, John Guy argued that French scholars had demonstrated that Lancelot de Carle and Crispin de Milherve were the same man.\"Weir believes that a separate poem by another Frenchman, an eyewitness at Anne's trial, one Crispin de Miherve, corroborates de Carles and adds extra details. Unfortunately, Crispin is a phantom. A French scholar proved in 1844 that the text Weir is using had been doctored, and in 1927 it was shown by comparing all the genuine manuscripts that the two poems are identical and by de Carles. Weir has been duped.\" More groundbreakingly, in 2010, Professor George W. Bernard, from the University of Southampton, suggested that the letter proves that Anne Boleyn could indeed be guilty of the adultery she was accused of.
