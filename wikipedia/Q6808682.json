When Phil learns about his brother's return, he tricks Grant into helping him with quest against Johnny. During Grant's absence, Phil and Johnny embarked on a feud that led to Dennis and Sharon getting involved. The impact escalated after Dennis humiliated Johnny on Christmas Day 2005, which prompted Johnny to throttle Sharon with an ultimatum; Dennis will be killed unless she and him leave Walford for good. On the eve of 2006 commencing, Dennis learned from Phil about the threat Johnny made to Sharon \u2013 as well as being told that Johnny killed his best-friend and Sam's ex-husband, Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), on the same night Chrissie killed Den. This resulted in Dennis beating up Johnny, who then ordered Jake's brother Danny (Jake Maskall) \u2013 his henchman \u2013 to kill Dennis. Following Dennis' murder, Phil was wracked with guilt for sparking the events of Sharon losing her husband and has vowed revenge on Johnny more than ever. After hearing Phil explain his reasons for wanting to bring Johnny to justice for killing Dennis, specifically as a promise he made to Sharon before she left Walford, Grant reluctantly accompanies his brother in settling their score with Johnny once and for all. Their efforts quickly falter by Grant arguing with Phil about the situation he has put them in, all the while Phil demands Grant to maintain their course against Johnny \u2013 who uses this opportunity to capture the brothers. Johnny later orders Danny to kill the brothers and bury them in the woods. After marching them into the forest for execution, Danny prepares to kill Grant; however, the brothers are saved when Jake appears and shoots Danny \u2013 accidentally killing him. After telling the brothers that it was Danny who killed Dennis on Johnny's orders, Jake allows Phil and Grant to flee whilst he himself proceeds to bury Danny in the woods. Phil and Grant rush back to Johnny's mansion to confront him once more, only to find out that he has already been arrested; Johnny surrendered to the police after his daughter, Ruby (Louisa Lytton) threatened to disown her father unless he confessed to his crimes. Following his arrest, Johnny is sentenced to life imprisonment and later dies of a heart attack \u2013 allowing Phil and Grant to finally put their demons to reason for good. The brothers reconcile after Phil apologises to Grant for the situation he put them in, and Grant forgives Phil for his actions."]}, {"page": "EastEnders theme tune", "response": ["| 40 || 9 June 2006 || Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Courtney Mitchell (Megan Jossa) leave Walford to live in Portugal."]}, {"page": "Billy Elliot the Musical", "response": ["* Debbie \u2013 Amy Duggan, Megan Jossa\"Additions to Billy Elliot cast\"  monstersandcritics.com.
