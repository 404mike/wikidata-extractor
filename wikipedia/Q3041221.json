In her 1977 autobiography A Life of Contrasts, she wrote, \"I didn't love Hitler any more than I did Winston [Churchill]. I can't regret it, it was so interesting.\" In her final interviews with Duncan Fallowell in 2002, she responded that her reaction to the newsreels of death camps was \"Well, of course, horror. Utter horror. Exactly the same probably as your reactions.\" However, when asked about having revulsion against Hitler for this, she said that \"I had a complete revulsion against the people who did it but I could never efface from my memory the man I had actually experienced before the war. A very complicated feeling. I can't really relate those two things to each other. I know I'm not supposed to say that but I just have to.\" At other times, however, she behaved so as to suggest intense anti-semitic attitudes; the journalist Paul Callan remembered mentioning that he was Jewish while interviewing her husband in Diana's presence. According to Callan, \"I mentioned, just in the course of conversation, that I was Jewish\u2014at which Lady Mosley went ashen, snapped a crimson nail and left the room ... No explanation was given but she would later write to a friend: 'A nice, polite reporter came to interview Tom [as Mosley was known] but he turned out to be Jewish and was sitting there at our table.
