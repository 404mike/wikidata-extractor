Working mainly in a Neo-Classical style, his extensive output made a significant contribution to the Monmouth townscape.  The architectural historian John Newman writes that his buildings \"give(.) Monmouth its particular architectural flavour.  For two decades from the mid-1820s he put up a sequence of public buildings and private houses in the town, in a style deft, cultured, and only occasionally unresolved.\" The Market Hall and 1-6 Priory Street are considered Maddox's \"most important projects\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
