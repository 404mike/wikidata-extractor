Of the starting forward line of Billy Brawn, Jack Sibbald, Frederick Chapple, Bob McTavish and Patsy Hendren, Chapple and Hendren were the only players to score during the period, which lead manager Halliday to sign Chelsea's Hugh Dolby and Bill Smith from non-league football. Dolby failed to score in four matches and was dropped, while Smith helped contribute to a revival in mid-November, after full back Dusty Rhodes replaced Fred Halliday as manager on 13 November 1912. Between 9 November and 5 March 1913, Brentford lost just three matches, but another loss of form and injuries to the forward line led to seven consecutive defeats in March. A crucial 4\u20131 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on 5 April boosted the Bees' survival chances, but a defeat and a win in the following two matches respectively put Brentford one place above the relegation zone going into the final day, level on points with Norwich City, but ahead by virtue of a 0.774 goal average.", "|Jack Sibbald", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jack Sibbald", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jack Sibbald", "| Jack Sibbald"]}, {"page": "1910\u201311 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Jack Sibbald", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jack Sibbald", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jack Sibbald"]}, {"page": "1909\u201310 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jack Sibbald"]}]}}
