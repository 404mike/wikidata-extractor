They were Monte, Perc, Ern, Wally, Bud and Frank.\nWally Westmore's career began with the highly successful Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) in which the transition of Fredric March from Jekyll to Hyde was considered groundbreaking in the field of film make-up.

Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor Wally Westmore to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined."]}, {"page": "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)", "response": ["Wally Westmore's make-up for Hyde \u2014 simian and hairy with large canine teeth \u2014 influenced greatly the popular image of Hyde in media and comic books. In part this reflected the novella's implication of Hyde as embodying repressed evil, and hence being semi-evolved or simian in appearance. The characters of Muriel Carew and Ivy Pierson do not appear in Stevenson's original story; Ivy Pierson's character is original to the film, while Muriel [Agnes] Carew does appear in the 1887 stage version by playwright Thomas Russell Sullivan."]}, {"page": "To Catch a Thief", "response": ["* Makeup supervision - Wally Westmore "]}, {"page": "The Court Jester", "response": ["* Wally Westmore\u2015makeup supervision"]}, {"page": "Darryl Hickman", "response": ["In 1946, he played the younger version of Van Heflin's character Sam Masterson in the film noir The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. To make it seem credible that Hickman looked like a young Van Heflin, the latter provided a picture of himself as a teenager to  makeup artist Wally Westmore.  In this period, he also acted alongside Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde in the 1945 film Leave Her to Heaven. Being the sole survivor among the cast, he provided extra commentary in the DVD release of the movie. His experience of working with Tierney was mixed, considering her to have been aloof and not given her best performance. It won Tierney an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The year after the release of Leave Her to Heaven, Hickman was lauded by a newspaper as \"one of Hollywood's top juveniles\".  Hickman later became critical of child acting, lamenting how the profession for young actors deprives them of a real childhood. He opted to get therapeutical assistance for several years to come to terms with his past."]}, {"page": "Little Boy Lost (1953 film)", "response": ["Costumes were designed by Edith Head.
