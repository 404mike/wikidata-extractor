They also convinced Mihailovi\u0107 that active resistance was futile for as long as the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans. The killings occurred only a few days before Captain Bill Hudson, a Special Operations Executive officer, met with Mihailovi\u0107 at his Ravna Gora headquarters. Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. \"Morning and night was the most desolating atmosphere,\" he recounted, \"because the women were out in the fields, and every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails. This had a very strong effect on Mihailovi\u0107.\" \"The tragedy gave to Nedi\u0107 convincing proof that the Serbs would be biologically exterminated if they were not submissive,\" Djilas wrote, \"and to the Chetniks proof that the Partisans were prematurely provoking the Germans\". Mihailovi\u0107's decision to refrain from attacking the Germans led to a rift with Tito and the Partisans. The Chetniks' non-resistance made it easier for the Germans to confront the Partisans, who for much of the remainder of the war could not defeat them in open combat."]}, {"page": "List of SOE agents", "response": ["|Bill Hudson||||  British|| 1910-1995|| DSO OBE || According to The Sunday Times, Ian Fleming used Hudson as a model for his character, James Bond.

The mission was put on hold due to pushback from Stalin who wanted neither the British nor Americans to support the Poles. SOE eventually decided to go ahead with a mission working with the Polish resistance, but by this time, the Warsaw Uprising had already been suppressed. Under the command of Bill Hudson, Kemp and other SOE agents dropped into south eastern Poland, near Cz\u0119stochowa, with the goal of assisting the Home Army in an advisory role. On New Years Day, the farm the SOE was using as an HQ was attacked by Germans, and Kemp and the other SOE agents barely escaped while the resistance fighters held back German half tracks to cover their retreat. After the Red Army had taken all of Poland, Hudson had received orders from London to turn themselves over to the Soviets. Expecting to be welcomed as friends and allies, Hudson, Kemp, and the rest of the SOE were instead imprisoned by the NKVD. During this imprisonment, they were regularly questioned and interrogated. Kemp believes they did this due to the ongoing Yalta Conference to see what the future of British-Soviet relations would be like before releasing SOE agents.

He was a major in the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force prior to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, and was involved in the coup that deposed Prince Paul of Yugoslavia on 27 March 1941. After the coup, he escorted Prince Paul to exile in Greece, and was in Cairo during the invasion in April. In September 1941, he was landed on the coast of the Italian governorate of Montenegro along with the British Special Operations Executive officer Captain Bill Hudson and two companions. He escorted Hudson to the German-occupied territory of Serbia and introduced him to the Yugoslav Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito at U\u017eice, then accompanied Hudson to Ravna Gora to meet Mihailovi\u0107. Ostoji\u0107 soon became Mihailovi\u0107's chief of staff, and after the German attempt to capture the Chetnik leader during Operation Mihailovic in December 1941, brought the Chetnik Supreme Command staff to Montenegro where they were re-united with Mihailovi\u0107 in June 1942. During the remainder of 1942, Ostoji\u0107 launched a counter-attack against Usta\u0161e troops of the Independent State of Croatia returning to the eastern Bosnian town of Fo\u010da where they were expected to continue their genocidal anti-Serb policies. As many as 2,000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in the town by forces under Ostoji\u0107's command. Ostoji\u0107 later oversaw large-scale massacres of civilians and burning of Muslim villages in the border region between Montenegro and the Sand\u017eak.", "Following the subsequent German-led invasion of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav capitulation 11 days later, Ostoji\u0107 remained in Cairo until he was selected to join a combined British\u2013Yugoslav Special Operations Executive team which was to infiltrate into occupied Yugoslavia and make contact with resistance groups. The other members of the team were: Captain Bill Hudson; a fellow JKRV officer, Major Mirko Lalatovi\u0107; and a radio operator. They flew from Cairo to Malta on 13 September 1941, before being landed from the British submarine HMS Triumph on the coast of the Italian governorate of Montenegro near Petrovac between 20 and 22 September 1941. They quickly came into contact with the communist-led Montenegrin Partisans, including Milovan \u0110ilas and Arso Jovanovi\u0107, who escorted Hudson and Ostoji\u0107 to Partisan-held U\u017eice in the German-occupied territory of Serbia. While Hudson familiarised himself with the Partisans, Ostoji\u0107 went on to visit the Chetnik leader Pukovnik Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107's headquarters at Ravna Gora. After briefing Mihailovi\u0107, Ostoji\u0107 went back to escort Hudson to Ravna Gora, arriving there on 25 October. When he first arrived at Ravna Gora, Ostoji\u0107 had delivered a message to Mihailovi\u0107 from the War Minister of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, Armijski \u0111eneral Bogoljub Ili\u0107, assuring him of the official support of the government-in-exile, but stating that \"a rebellion would not be tolerated\". Ostoji\u0107 also told Mihailovi\u0107 that the communists had taken control of Montenegro. Ostoji\u0107 and Lalatovi\u0107 then assumed senior staff positions in Mihailovi\u0107's supreme command headquarters."]}, {"page": "D. T.
