When secondary sources list the incarnations of the Doctor, they list Hartnell, Troughton, ..., Tennant and now Smith (and sometimes Cushing and maybe occasionally Grant). Show me some citations that bother listing The Watcher and The Valeyard or Hurndall in the same way! This navigation box is always going to be a summary, a simplification. One will always be able to ask why no Trevor Martin, or whoever. It seems to me that it would be more useful, following WP:WAF, to list the Doctors that most secondary sources bother with.

I've tried to present an argument based on Wikipedia principles of notability, an out-of-universe perspective and reliable sources. As I said before, show me some citations that list Hurndall in the same way as Hartnell, Troughton, Pertwee, etc. I can't think of any. Yes, of course, Hurndall played the 1st Doctor in \"The Five Doctors\" and that is covered in the articles on that story and on the First Doctor, but what we have here is just a briefy summary to aid navigation. Most citations, as far as I can see, list Hartnell, Troughton, Pertwee, Baker, Davison, Baker, McCoy, McGann, Eccleston and Smith (or some subset thereof), so it seems to me sensible to do the same.
