It includes detailed analyses of Trump family financial records. The article describes an alleged tax fraud scheme conducted by Trump and his siblings related to their joint inheritance of their parents's real estate holdings, effectively evading over $500million in gift and estate taxes. The alleged schemes involved siphoning money from the companies to the children throughout their lives and understating the value of transferred properties. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance announced on the day of the expos\u00e9's publication that it would review the allegations. In mid-2021, Mary L.
