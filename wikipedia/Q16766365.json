Six days later, he provided an assist for Wayne Rooney against Newcastle United, and United went on to win the match 3\u20131.

After failing to offer any shots, either on or off target, and only having 26 touches against League One side Preston North End on 17 February, Martin Keown, a BBC commentator, described his performance as \"another night of nothing from Falcao\" and questioned if he was \"fit enough\". On 10 March, a day after being an unused substitute as United were knocked out of the FA Cup at home by Arsenal, Falcao played for their under-21 team in a 1\u20131 draw with Tottenham Hotspur, being substituted after 72 minutes. The demotion was publicly criticised by former footballers Dietmar Hamann and Willem van Hanegem, whom had described the decision Van Gaal made to be \"disrespectful and disgraceful\", despite Van Gaal saying that he didn't \"intend to humiliate\" Falcao.Falcao 'Turun Kelas' ke MU U-21, Van Gaal Dikecam Diego Maradona also criticised Van Gaal for his treatment of Falcao, saying, \"he was closer to the devil than anything.\" At season's end, he was adjudged by many to be among the worst signings of the season.
