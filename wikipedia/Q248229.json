With this in hand, Massey became Deputy Chief Scientist to the Scientific Section of Mine Design Department at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in Havant in early 1941. This time, the job was to create mines as good as the German ones. Massey brought his team with him. While Bates worked on packaging to protect the mine when it was dropped from an aircraft, Buckingham and Gunn calculated its theoretical effectiveness, and Crick designed the circuitry. Their mine codenamed MX, was soon in service, and the group turned its attention to developing acoustic or pressure mines. On the retirement of A. B.

Cauer's application of Tchebyscheff polynomials resulted in the filters now known as elliptic filters, or sometimes Cauer filters, which have optimally fast passband to stopband transitions for a given maximum attenuation variation.  The well known Chebyshev filters can be viewed as a special case of elliptic filters and can be arrived at using the same approximation techniques.  So can the Butterworth (maximally flat) filter, although this was an independent discovery by Stephen Butterworth arrived at by a different method.Cauer, 1927, 1933"]}, {"page": "Analogue filter", "response": ["The approximation problem in network synthesis is to find functions which will produce realisable networks approximating to a prescribed function of frequency within limits arbitrarily set. The approximation problem is an important issue since the ideal function of frequency required will commonly be unachievable with rational networks. For instance, the ideal prescribed function is often taken to be the unachievable lossless transmission in the passband, infinite attenuation in the stopband and a vertical transition between the two.  However, the ideal function can be approximated with a rational function, becoming ever closer to the ideal the higher the order of the polynomial.  The first to address this problem was Stephen Butterworth (1930) using his Butterworth polynomials. Independently, Cauer (1931) used Chebyshev polynomials, initially applied to image filters, and not to the now well-known ladder realisation of this filter.Darlington, pp.7\u20138", "Butterworth filters are an important classA class of filters is a collection of filters which are all described by the same class of mathematical function, for instance, the class of Chebyshev filters are all described by the class of Chebyshev polynomials.  For realisable linear passive networks, the transfer function must be a ratio of polynomial functions.  The order of a filter is the order of the highest order polynomial of the two and will equal the number of elements (or resonators) required to build it.  Usually, the higher the order of a filter, the steeper the roll-off of the filter will be. In general, the values of the elements in each section of the filter will not be the same if the order is increased and will need to be recalculated. This is in contrast to the image method of design which simply adds on more identical sections of filters due to Stephen Butterworth (1930)Butterworth, S, \"On the Theory of Filter Amplifiers\", Wireless Engineer, vol. 7, 1930, pp. 536\u2013541 which are now recognised as being a special case of Cauer's elliptic filters. Butterworth discovered this filter independently of Cauer's work and implemented it in his version with each section isolated from the next with a valve amplifier which made calculation of component values easy since the filter sections could not interact with each other and each section represented one term in the Butterworth polynomials. This gives Butterworth the credit for being both the first to deviate from image parameter theory and the first to design active filters. It was later shown that Butterworth filters could be implemented in ladder topology without the need for amplifiers.  Possibly the first to do so was William Bennett (1932)William R. Bennett, Transmission network, , filed 29 June 1929, issued 15 March 1932 in a patent which presents formulae for component values identical to the modern ones. Bennett, at this stage though, is still discussing the design as an artificial transmission line and so is adopting an image parameter approach despite having produced what would now be considered a network synthesis design. He also does not appear to be aware of the work of Butterworth or the connection between them.Matthaei et al., pp.85\u2013108"]}, {"page": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester", "response": ["Notable former  staff include  Frederic Calland Williams and  Tom Kilburn  who  pioneered the first stored-program digital computer, Stephen Butterworth famous for the eponymous filter.

Cauer et al., p. 5  A special case of elliptic rational functions is the Chebyshev polynomials due to Pafnuty Chebyshev (1821\u20131894) and is an important part of approximation theory.Swanson, p. 58  Chebyshev polynomials are widely used to design filters.  In 1930, British physicist Stephen Butterworth (1885\u20131958) designed the Butterworth filter, otherwise known as the maximally-flat filter, using Butterworth polynomials.McCarthy, p. 51  Butterworth's work was entirely independent of Cauer, but it was later found that the Butterworth polynomials were a limiting case of the Chebyshev polynomials.Swanson, p. 58  Even earlier (1929) and again independently, American engineer and scientist Edward Lawry Norton (1898\u20131983) designed a maximally-flat mechanical filter with a response entirely analogous to Butterworth's electrical filter.Darlington, p. 7", "If the requirement to use only passive elements is lifted, then the realisation can be greatly simplified.  Amplifiers can be used to buffer the parts of the network from each other so that they do not interact.Belevitch, p. 852  Each buffered cell can directly realise a pair of poles of the rational function.  There is then no need for any kind of iterative expansion of the function.  The first example of this kind of synthesis is due to Stephen Butterworth in 1930.Belevitch, p. 850  The Butterworth filter he produced became a classic of filter design, but more frequently implemented with purely passive rather than active components.  More generally applicable designs of this kind include the Sallen\u2013Key topology due to R. P. Sallen and E. L. Key in 1955 at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and the biquadratic filter.Glisson, p. 727  Like the Darlington approach, Butterworth and Sallen-Key start with a prescribed transfer function rather than an impedance.  A major practical advantage of active implementation is that it can avoid the use of wound components (transformers and inductors) altogether.Vaisband et al., p. 280  These are undesirable for manufacturing reasons.Comer & Comer, p. 435  Another feature of active designs is that they are not limited to PRFs.Wing, p. 91"]}]}}
