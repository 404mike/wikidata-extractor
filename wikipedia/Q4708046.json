The series was effectively a starring vehicle for Spall, produced in the vein of similar shows at the time like Minder and Lovejoy for example, whose principal characters seek to exploit and take advantage of others through unscrupulous business schemes in the pursuit for prosperity in their trade. It was commissioned by Carlton Television, during a time when the company was investing and promoting heavily in improving its comedy output with shows such 'Carlton Comedy Playhouse' and 'Head Over Heels', as a means of trying to boost ITV's reputation in comedy production and seriously challenge the BBC's dominance in this field. At the time, the series was produced as a part of a major \u00a358 million pound drive by ITV to improve its output across its network. Unfortunately, the series struggled to gain traction with viewers and regularly attracted viewing figures of less than eight million viewers on average. Made at a time when ITV was obsessed with promoting ratings grabbing prime time shows like A Touch of Frost, Peak Practice and Inspector Morse, the show barely stood a chance and was quietly cancelled after the second series had concluded in August 1994."]}]}}
