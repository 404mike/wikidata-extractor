Williams joined Everton from school, but transferred to Tranmere in May 1957, joining his brother Ray there. He scored 88 goals in 161 Football League appearances during his four seasons at Tranmere, but conflict with manager Walter Galbraith led to his being transfer-listed. Williams moved to Plymouth at the end of the 1960\u201361 season, then to Bristol Rovers soon after. He was then banned due to a bribery scandal. In 1962, Keith moved with Ray to South Africa to set up business there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Bristol Rovers F.C.", "response": ["For the 1962\u201363 season, Rovers abandoned their now familiar blue and white quarters in favour of blue pinstripes. Also in this season, the club signed goalkeeper Esmond Million from Middlesbrough for \u00a35,000. In April 1963, The People newspaper ran a story alleging that Million had accepted a bribe to lose the match against Bradford (Park Avenue) on 20 April. During the game he had allowed a backpass to slip past him and allowed a cross to go, enabling Bradford to score twice. Unfortunately for Million, Rovers also scored twice so the game ended 2\u20132 and Million did not receive the money he had been offered to lose the game. Million and his accomplice, Keith Williams, were fined \u00a350 each by Doncaster Magistrates' Court, and banned from football for life by The FA."]}, {"page": "Keith Williams", "response": ["Keith Williams may refer to:", "* Keith Williams (baseball) (born 1972), San Francisco Giants baseball player", "* Keith Williams (basketball) (born 1965), American basketball player", "* Keith Williams (bodybuilder) (born 1973), and former American footballer", "* Keith Williams (Australian footballer) (1926\u20132004), Fitzroy VFL footballer", "* Keith Williams (footballer, born 1937), footballer for Everton, Tranmere Rovers, Plymouth Argyle and Bristol Rovers", "* Keith Williams (footballer, born 1957), footballer for Aston Villa, Northampton Town and Bournemouth", "* Keith Williams (cornerback) (born 1983), Canadian football cornerback", "* Keith Williams (offensive lineman) (born 1988), Pittsburgh Steelers football player", "* Keith Williams (architect) (born 1958), British architect", "* Keith Williams (businessman), British businessman", "* Keith Williams (comics) (born 1957), American comic book and comic strip artist", "* Keith Williams (developer) (1929\u20132011), Australian entrepreneur", "* Keith Williams, Jamaican reggae singer better known as Honey Boy", "* Keith Williams, character in Ambush at Cimarron Pass", "* Keith Williams, winner of 2003 Jeopardy!
