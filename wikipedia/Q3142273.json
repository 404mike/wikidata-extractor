He was a leader in the field of intellectual property law. He was co-author of the Modern Law of Copyright (1980).Laddie was educated at Aldenham School and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He studied medicine but changed to law. He became a barrister in 1969. He is credited with having developed the idea of applying for an Anton Piller order while still a junior. After 25 years at the bar, he was appointed a High Court judge in April 1995, and was assigned to the Chancery Division, as one of the Patents Court judges.\nHe resigned from his post as a judge in 2005, \"because he found it boring\" and felt isolated on the bench. He became a consultant for Willoughby & Partners, a boutique law firm, UK legal arm of Rouse & Co International, a move which was criticised by some. He was thought to be the first High Court judge to resign voluntarily in 35 years, and the first subsequently to join a firm of solicitors. No one since Sir Henry Fisher, in 1970, had resigned from the bench.He was appointed to a Chair in Intellectual Property Law at University College London, with effect from 1 September 2006. He founded there the Institute of Brand and Innovation Law. The Sir Hugh Laddie chair in Intellectual Property has subsequently been established at UCL.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anton Piller order", "response": ["Hugh Laddie is generally credited with the \"invention\" of the Anton Piller order.See Guardian; Telegraph; UCL News (\"he is credited with having invented the 'Anton Piller' (search and seizure) order and was described by Lord Denning as the 'enterprising' Mr Laddie.\"); Rouse. .
