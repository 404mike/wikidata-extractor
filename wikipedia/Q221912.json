The taxon was originally known from a series of five specimens collected in Bhutan during 1933-1934 by the botanists Frank Ludlow and George Sheriff. Four of these specimens were referred to in the type description, which contained little information on the species' biology other than they were collected at an altitudinal range of 2000\u20132200 metres in forest."]}, {"page": "Ascreavie", "response": ["A new house was built on the estate in the 1850s, to designs by the Dundee architect William Scott. The Youngs lived there until the 1940s when it was purchased by the circus-owning family of Bertram Mills. The house was then sold on in 1949 to Major George Sherriff (1898\u20131967). Major Sherriff had undertaken a number of plant collecting expeditions with Frank Ludlow in the Himalayas in the 1930s. At Ascreavie he and his wife began to develop the gardens using plants which he had gathered on these expeditions, including many rare rhododendrons. Since Sherriff's death, the plant collection has been maintained, and a number of specimens have been donated to botanic gardens in Dundee and Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "Paeonia ludlowii", "response": ["The species was named in his honor Frank Ludlow who collected seed of Paeonia ludlowii in the Tsangpo Valley (upper Brahmaputra river) in 1936, after which it became for the first time known to western science, on his expedition with Major George Sherriff in South-East Tibet."]}, {"page": "Paeonia sterniana", "response": ["Paeonia sterniana resulted from hybridisation between P. lactiflora and P. mairei which in the past probably were sympatric in the Himalayas, but are no longer present in the same area where P. sterniana occurs. P. sterniana was discovered for western science in 1938, by Frank Ludlow and George Taylor. Seeds were brought to the West in 1947, and subsequently cultivation started at Kew Gardens. Harold Roy Fletcher described the species in 1959. In 1997 Joseph Halda thought this taxon not worthy of full species status and reduced it to P. emodi subsp. sterniana. This view however is not supported in the most recent literature."]}, {"page": "Four Rugby Boys", "response": ["Tibetologist Alex McKay observes that the three surviving Rugby boys formed, together with their fellow countrymen that had been educated in British India or at Frank Ludlow's English school at Gyantse (1923\u20131926), \"a growing circle of generally progressive thinkers, in whose company Europeans visitors felt comfortable\" and who were recognised by the British cadre as \"a major propaganda channel\".Alex McKay, Tibet and the British Raj: the frontier cadre, 1904\u20131947, Curzon Press, Richmond, 1997, p. 293, p. 136: \"They formed a growing circle of generally progressive thinkers, in whose company European visitors felt comfortable.

By contrast, Ludlow observed the species in southeastern Tibet, probably during the winter, and did not find it particularly reserved. He reports having killed a specimen in a willow tree, far from the species' usual coniferous nesting grounds. The specimen was captured on the outskirts of a forest, on a ridge between two valleys, where it stood on a dead branch from which it launched in pursuit of insects in flight, like a flycatcher."]}, {"page": "Frederick Claude Stern", "response": ["Stern collected plants between 1900 and 1910, working with Reginald Farrer, Frank Ludlow, Joseph Rock, and George Sherriff. In 1914 he financially participated in a plant collecting expedition by Farrer and William Purdom to Yunnan and Kansu. He cultivated some of the novelties collected in Yunnan and Gansu in his garden at Highdown. Other plant hunters sent new plants to Stern, and he acquired an extensive collection of plants from Veitch & Son in 1912. Over the years, Stern introduced many new plants to the garden and created new hybrids of Berberis, Eremurus, hellebore, lily, Magnolia, rose and snowdrop, among which Magnolia 'Highdownensis' (probable cultivar of M. wilsonii), rambler roses 'Coral' (a triploid R. sinowilsonii hybrid), 'Weddingday' (1950, R. sinowilsonii hybrid), and Rosa \u00d7highdownensis (1928, R. moyesii hybrid).

Many of the specimens collected by Sherriff are held in the Natural History Museum, London. In 1947 he was appointed OBE, and in 1948 was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour.

The land was in walking distance of the centre of Perth on the lower banks of Kinnoull Hill. The new arts and crafts house was called Branklyn and in the former orchard they laid out their gardens. The gardens were remarkable because they used unusual Asian seeds which were native to Tibet, Bhutan and China. The seeds were sourced from Lhasa-based naturalist Frank Ludlow, the Scottish botanist George Forrest, English explorer Frank Kingdon-Ward, and other plant collectors. Her husband took the lead on the design and layout, but it was Dorothy who was the skilled botanist and horticulturist."]}, {"page": "Ludlow (name)", "response": ["* Frank Ludlow (1885\u20131972), English botanist, ornithologist, and World War I officer"]}]}}
