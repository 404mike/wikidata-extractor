Sassoon and Sitwell were often seen out in each other's company, leading Sassoon's friend and mentor, the critic Edmund Gosse, to suggest that they marry. According to Sassoon's biographer, Max Egremont, Sassoon quickly replied, \"I don't think poets should marry one another.\" Throughout the 1920s and 30s, Sitwell relied on Sassoon for criticism of her work, both privately and publicly. In 1922 he wrote a glowing review of Fa\u00e7ade in the Daily Herald entitled 'Too Fantastic for Fat-Heads,' in which he compared Sitwell to the artist Aubrey Beardsley and declared, 'Aubrey Beardsley has triumphed over all the fat-heads of his day.
