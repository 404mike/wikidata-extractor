He played county cricket only from the age of 26, but his abity to make the ball rise sharply on the somewhat fiery Old Trafford wickets became noticed the following year, but after the wickets became less difficult he was dropped from the side. The following year, his bowling was a valuable part of Lancashire's finest season in county cricket (sixteen wins and no losses) but his inability to play late in the season attracted the notice of Wisden.\nThe following year, he improved even further \u2013 at times bowling well even on wickets too dead to suit a fast bowler. A superb display of pace and length against Somerset at Old Trafford made him an automatic choice for the Test team for the Fourth Test against Australia. He took four wickets in each innings, and in the final match of the series at The Oval took six out of the 14 wickets to fall, including five for 110 runs in the first innings. In all cricket that season, he took the wicket of Victor Trumper six times and finished with an aggregate of 181 wickets for 19.25 each. His tremendous stamina and ability to maintain his fastest pace through even the longest spells of bowling was described as \"nothing short of remarkable\" by the 1906 Wisden.\nHowever, having established himself as the best fast bowler in the world, at the end of the season Brearley announced that business claims would prevent him playing again. Although he changed his mind and did play five times for Lancashire in 1906 besides helping Neville Knox to form a remarkably hostile attack for the Gentlemen at Lord's, he refused to play again for his county until 1908. In 1907, Brearley only played a handful of first-class games for the Gentlemen and a couple of privately raised teams, but was still thought good enough to only just miss out on a Test place at Lord's against South Africa. 1908 saw Brearley end his dispute with the Lancashire committee and bowl superbly before business kept him out of most of the August matches. He took 148 wickets in just seventeen matches and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. In 1909 he was even more impressive so long as he could play, but failed in his only Test, and in the following two years business and a major accident limited him to just fourteen of Lancashire's fifty eight Championship games.\nThe following year, Brearley's rift with the Lancashire committee became irreconcilable and at the beginning of 1912 it was clear he would play no county cricket. However, so well-thought of was he that, playing when business allowed for Cheshire in the Minor Counties competition, Brearley played one further Test but the wicket was too soft for him to get a foothold.\nEven when the best fast bowler in the world, Brearley could never go on an overseas tour owing to business commitments.\nBrearley made one late first-class appearance in 1921 at the age of 45 when he was picked for Archie MacLaren's amateur team that took on, and beat, Warwick Armstrong's previously invincible Australians. Brearley's own contribution was modest: he scored one run and did not bowl.\nA wholehearted cricketer who bustled about whatever he did, Brearley's batting fame rested on his hurried walk to the wicket and the much-told Old Trafford story that, at the sound of him scurrying to the wicket, the horse walked between the shafts of the heavy roller ready for the end of the innings. In all cricket, he took 844 wickets but scored only 908 runs.Neville Cardus wrote \"Every ball was a crisis as far as Brealey was concerned\".Brearley maintained faith in his ability long after his retirement.  When watching new fast bowlers in later years Brearley was often heard to exclaim that he could still 'throw his hat faster'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1908 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the YearThis award was subtitled Lord Hawke and Four Cricketers of the Year. \u2013 Walter Brearley, Lord Hawke, Jack Hobbs, Alan Marshal, John Newstead"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Walter Brearley"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Lancashire won its first county championship in 1897, a productive bowling attack made up of Johnny Briggs, Willis Cuttell, Albert Hallam, and Arthur Mold took 420\u00a0wickets between them.

However, by developing fast-medium swingers of a similar style to George HirstThe Times; 4 June 1909; p. 12 as a dry-weather alternative to his slow-medium spinners, Dean improved steadily to be by 1910 clearly the best bowler in the Lancashire eleven with 137 wickets.Pardon, Sydney H.; John Wisden\u2019s Cricketers\u2019 Almanac; Forty-Eighth Edition (1911); Part II, p. 67 In 1911, although he was overworked when Walter Brearley was away on business, Dean went from strength to strength, taking 175 wickets in the County Championship and being by 23 wickets the leading bowler in first-class cricketFirst-Class Bowling in England in 1911 by Wickets. cricketarchive.co.uk (and this in spite of often resting when the fast bowler was away from business).

When Brearley came back into the eleven in 1908, Cook was relegated to the Second Eleven, but in 1910 he re-established in place and in the May following year, helped by a bad pitch and feeble Northamptonshire batting, he bowled with considerable pace and a lot of spin to take eight wickets for 39 runs. Cook indeed bowled so well early that season that Lancashire seemed to have found an excellent pace bowler when Brearley could not play. However, he was felt impossible to fit in when that fast bowler was free from business and on returning to the side he did not maintain his early season form, nor did he do anything of note against the top counties."]}, {"page": "List of Lancashire County Cricket Club records", "response": ["|align=left|1.\u00a0Harry Dean2.\u00a0Walter Brearley3.\u00a0Harry Dean"]}, {"page": "Henry Martyn (cricketer)", "response": ["Martyn didn't appear again for Somerset until July 1902, when he was part of the team to face the touring Australians, a match in which he played as a specialist batsman, making a half-century in the first-innings.

England had won the first Test of the summer against the Australians comfortably by 10 wickets. The selection committee who chose the team for the second Test at Lord's omitted Gilbert Jessop and named 13 players, including both Jayes and King of Leicestershire, plus Tom Hayward if he could prove his fitness. On the morning of the match, despite weather that had made the pitch ideal for fast bowling, Jayes was left out and England went into the game without a fast bowler and with the unfit Hayward: the Australians won by nine wickets and went on to win The Ashes by two games to one, with two draws. Wisden's editor Sydney Pardon blamed \"extraordinary blundering\" in the selection committee for a match that, he wrote, \"proved the turning point of the season\". Jayes should not have been picked in the first place, Pardon wrote, because Walter Brearley should have been selected; but, \"failing Brearley, Jayes ought clearly to have played, a right-handed fast bowler being, according to nearly all expert opinion, an absolute necessity at Lord's\". Late in the season when the Test series was over, Jayes played for \"An England XI\" against the Australians in a \"holiday game\" at Blackpool, but he was not selected for any Tests.
