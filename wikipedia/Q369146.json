Dean enjoyed a run in the team in late August and throughout September, but was dropped after losses by three and four goals to Norwich City and Middlesbrough respectively. Dean later told the Hounslow Chronicle that he felt he had been made the scapegoat for the defeats; manager Mark Warburton suggested that his players should keep their frustrations private. He broke back into the team in late October and went on to keep hold of his starting place for much of the season alongside Tarkowski.
