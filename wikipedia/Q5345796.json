That was his only appearance that season; the following summer he again played once, this time against Oxford University, taking two wickets and hitting his highest score, 43, from number ten in the order.\nIn 1905 Solly played two County Championship games with reasonable success: he took seven wickets at 25.28, including a career best of 3-25 against Gloucestershire. He played a single match the following year (against Oxford) and in 1907 appeared twice more in the Championship, claiming 3-66 in what proved to be his last innings' bowling, against Somerset.\nHe died in Wales at the age of 83, in Cefn Mably, Glamorgan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*Edward Walter Solly (1882\u20131966) \u2013 cricketer for Worcestershire"]}, {"page": "Solly", "response": ["* Edward Walter Solly (1882\u20131966), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Edward Solly (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward Walter Solly (1882\u20131966), English cricketer"]}]}}
