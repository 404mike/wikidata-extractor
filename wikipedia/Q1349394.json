One of the great Victorian botanical explorers, Spruce spent 15 years exploring the Amazon from the Andes to its mouth, and was one of the first Europeans to visit many of the places where he collected specimens. Spruce discovered and named a number of new plant species, and corresponded with some of the leading botanists of the nineteenth century.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Russel Wallace", "response": ["Wallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near Bel\u00e9m, then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist Richard Spruce, along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from yellow fever), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.Wilson p. 36; Raby pp. 89, 98\u201399, 120\u201321.", "After a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace.van Whye, John Dispelling the Darkness, World Scientific, 2013, p. 310. However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement.Shermer p. 156. In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, William Mitten, an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built the Dell, a house of concrete, on land he leased in Grays in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867\u20131874), Violet (1869\u20131945), and William (1871\u20131951).Slotten pp. 239\u201340."]}, {"page": "Amazon River", "response": ["* Richard Spruce, 1849\u20131864"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Richard Spruce (1817\u20131893), English botanistAbbreviation in botany: Spruce and explorer who collected plants in South America"]}, {"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*Richard Spruce"]}, {"page": "Henry Walter Bates", "response": ["Henry Bates was one of a group of outstanding naturalist-explorers who were supporters of the theory of evolution by natural selection (Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace 1858).

In 1939, Japanese mycologist Yosio Kobayasi described Nakaiomyces nipponicus, a similar-looking fungus that differed by having scattered, dark spines on its surface. Later research, however, showed that the fruit bodies were those of Tremella fuciformis parasitized by an ascomycete, Ceratocystis epigloeum, that formed the dark spines.

Shoumatoff had in fact spent eight months in Bates's \"glorious forest\" (he quotes) with a copy in his backpack; he thus admires Bates's acceptance of the inevitable discomfort and homesickness from personal knowledge, noting that Bates only complained when all the following had occurred together: he had been robbed, he had gone barefoot having worn out his shoes, he had received no parcels from England, and worst of all he had nothing left to read. But otherwise Bates was \"lost in wonder\" at the astonishing diversity of the natural history of the Amazons. He was, writes Shoumatoff, one of the four largely self-educated geniuses who pioneered tropical biology, and who all knew each other: Darwin, Wallace, Bates, and the botanist Richard Spruce."]}, {"page": "Welburn, Derwent", "response": ["* Richard Spruce, English botanist and explorer."]}, {"page": "Yurimaguas", "response": ["With a long and illustrious history,Samuel Fritz, \"Misi\u00f3n de los Omaguas, Yurimaguas, Aizuares, Ibanomas y otras naciones desde Napo al rio Negro\" in Pablo Maroni's 1738 Noticias aut\u00e9nticas del famoso r\u00edo Mara\u00f1\u00f3n or Journal of the Travels and Labours of Father Samuel Fritz in the River of the Amazons 1686-2008, reprinted in 1922) Yurimaguas is a tourist destination, especially during the August 15 annual Catholic festival of the Assumption.
