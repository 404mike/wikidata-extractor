Lady de Clifford complained about Charlotte's allowing her ankle-length underdrawers to show.  Lady Charlotte Bury, a lady-in-waiting to Caroline and a diarist whose writings have survived, described the Princess as a \"fine piece of flesh and blood\" who had a candid manner and rarely chose to \"put on dignity\".  Her father was proud of her horsemanship.  She was fond of music by Mozart and Haydn, and she identified with the character of Marianne in Sense and Sensibility. In 1808, Charlotte Jones was appointed as Charlotte's own official miniature portrait painter."]}, {"page": "William Light", "response": ["Returning to England in 1824, Light met and fell in love with the beautiful and wealthy 19-year-old Mary Bennet, illegitimate daughter of the 3rd Duke of Richmond, in the London studio of the miniature painter Charlotte Jones. After a whirlwind romance, they married on 16 October 1824. They travelled to Europe, spending a couple of years in France, Switzerland and Italy (mainly Rome), where Light published his Views of Pompeii in 1828. Light returned to England, where he bought a yacht, Gulnare, after which the couple cruised the Mediterranean for some years. In 1830 they went to Egypt, where Light first met promoters of a new colony in Australia. Light made numerous sketches and Mary studied Egyptology while in Egypt, becoming a friend and keen correspondent of Egyptologist John Gardner Wilkinson. The couple became friends with Muhammad Ali, Pasha and founder of modern Egypt."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Jones", "response": ["Charlotte Jones may refer to:", "* Charlotte Jones (writer) (born 1968), British playwright and actress", "* Charlotte Jones (painter) (1768\u20131847), miniature painter to Princess Charlotte", "* Charlotte Jones (comics), fictional character (a latent mutant in the Marvel Comics Universe)"]}, {"page": "Maria Cosway", "response": ["The end of her life included service at her school, making substantial renovations and additions to the medieval building.
