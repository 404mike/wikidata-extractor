Leading by 158 on first innings, England got a dream start by dismissing Lisa Keightley for a duck, and wickets just kept falling. Gunn and Brunt took two wickets each as the Australians faltered to 18 for 4, before the twin sisters Kate and Alex Blackwell fought back. However, Isa Guha removed Alex, another two wickets fell, and by tea Australia were 67 for 7. An attritional partnership for the seventh wicket between Kate Blackwell and Shelley Nitschke, which yielded 112 runs in four hours, carried Australia past 100, but still they were only 21 ahead with three wickets in hand at the close of day three. The last day started just like England wanted, Katherine Brunt dismissing Kate Blackwell and wicket-keeper Julia Price with successive deliveries, and all that was left was to take the last wicket. England toiled, but the Australians defended for nearly two hours and faced 35 overs, until number 11 Emma Liddell finally edged behind to Jane Smit and was out for 24. Shelley Nitschke made her second fifty in two Tests and was left stranded on 88 not out, while slow left arm bowler Clare Connor ended with the bowling analysis of 26-20-25-1. Brunt finished with four wickets in the second innings, for a match total of nine for 111.", "England, buoyed by having won their first Ashes Test series in 42 years, tied the series at 2\u20132 with a victory at The County Ground, Taunton. Australia, however, made a good start with Lisa Keightley and Karen Rolton making fifties to propel the team to 142 for 1. Two quick wickets from Clare Connor slowed them down, however, and they finished with a total on 215 for 5. Chasing that total, England lost Charlotte Edwards for 1 in the second over, but Laura Newton and Claire Taylor put them back with a 65-run partnership. Spinner Lisa Sthalekar then took two quick wickets, and England were set back to 79 for 3 after 19.3 overs. Despite two maiden overs from left-arm bowler Karen Rolton, Taylor kept hitting boundaries, ending with 116 before finally letting a ball from Cathryn Fitzpatrick onto her stumps - bowled for 116. By that time, though, she had made the first century of the series, and England only needed five more runs to win. Lydia Greenway and Jane Smit carried England over the target with nine balls to spare, setting up the fifth and final match, also at Taunton, to be a series decider."]}, {"page": "Jane Cassar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jane Smit"]}, {"page": "Women's Cricket World Cup", "response": ["| Jane Smit || "]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 ICC Women's Quadrangular Series", "response": ["* Jane Smit"]}, {"page": "1993 Women's Cricket World Cup", "response": ["* Jane Smit"]}, {"page": "Smit", "response": ["* Jane Smit (b. 1972), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1997 Women's Cricket World Cup", "response": ["* Most dismissals: Jane Smit (ENG) 13.Most dismissals \u2013 Hero Honda Women's World Cup, 1997/98 from CricInfo retrieved 2 June 2008", "* Most dismissals in an innings: Jane Smit (ENG) Four.Most dismissals in an innings \u2013 Hero Honda Women's World Cup, 1997/98 from CricInfo retrieved 2 June 2008"]}]}}
