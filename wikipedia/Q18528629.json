She worked at University College London, where she attained the rank of reader. Armstrong is most known for her work on English intonation as well as the phonetics and tone of Somali and Kikuyu. Her book on English intonation, written with Ida C. Ward, was in print for 50 years. Armstrong also provided some of the first detailed descriptions of tone in Somali and Kikuyu.\nArmstrong grew up in Northern England. She graduated from the University of Leeds, where she studied French and Latin. She taught French in an elementary school in the London suburbs for a while, but then joined the University College Phonetics Department, headed by Daniel Jones. Her most notable works were the 1926 book A Handbook of English Intonation, co-written with Ward, the 1934 paper \"The Phonetic Structure of Somali\", and the book The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu, published posthumously in 1940 after she died of a stroke in 1937 at age 55.\nShe was the subeditor of the International Phonetic Association's journal Le Ma\u00eetre Phon\u00e9tique for more than a decade, and was praised in her day for her teaching, both during the academic term and in the department's summer vacation courses. Jones wrote in his obituary of her that she was \"one of the finest phoneticians in the world\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 9", "response": ["*1937 \u2013 Lilias Armstrong, English phonetician (b. 1882)"]}, {"page": "Daniel Jones (phonetician)", "response": ["Apart from his own vast array of published work, Jones will be remembered for having acted as mentor to numerous scholars who later went on to become famous linguists in their own right.

The book was published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed he should have been listed as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a phonetics course from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled by a grant from the International African Institute, he also took a social anthropology course under Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans in Kenya."]}, {"page": "Index of phonetics articles", "response": ["* Lilias Armstrong"]}, {"page": "1937 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 9 December \u2014 Lilias Armstrong, phonetician (born 1882)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Leeds people", "response": ["*Lilias Armstrong, phonetician (B.A., 1906)"]}, {"page": "1882 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 29 September \u2013 Lilias Armstrong, phonetician (died 1937)"]}, {"page": "Armstrong (surname)", "response": ["*Lilias Armstrong (1882\u20131937), English phonetician"]}, {"page": "Lilias", "response": ["* Lilias Armstrong (1882 \u2013 1937), British phonetician "]}, {"page": "List of people from Salford", "response": ["* Lilias Armstrong (1882\u20131937), phonetician; born in Pendlebury"]}]}}
