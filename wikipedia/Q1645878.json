After training at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, she was awarded the Lenin Prize for sculpture before fleeing the communist regime in 1967. She visited Chile where a sympathetic socialist government led by Salvador Allende was in power.\nShe escaped from Prague in 1967 with her doctor husband and her three children. They travelled in an old battered car to Yugoslavia, on the pretence of a camping holiday. They only had passports for themselves; the children were not included on them. Through a fortunate coincidence, an Italian couple, who were travelling alone but had three of their children included on their passports, took pity on the couple's predicament, and offered to follow them through the border to Italy, bringing the three children in as their own.\nReunited with the children, they travelled through Italy and crossed into France. Sedleck\u00e1 spent months in Paris alone with the children, staying with very generous friends, while her husband journeyed on alone to Britain to attempt to make entry arrangements for them all. They were finally granted the necessary visas to enable them to settle in Britain.\nHer first private commission in Britain, in 1975, was from Kathleen Hunt of Walthamstow, for a 70 cm resin statue of the Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus (The Madonna). She sculpted many monumental portraits and busts since, including Freddie Mercury of Queen, now in Montreux, Switzerland; Beau Brummell in Piccadilly, London, and many in private collections. (Her statue of Mercury served as a model for the large illuminated statue that currently dominates the front of the Dominion Theatre in London since the May 2002 premiere of the musical We Will Rock You.)\nCommissioned portrait heads include Laurence Olivier (she also modeled the huge head used for his appearance in Dave Clark's musical Time at the Dominion Theatre), Donald Sinden, Paul Eddington, Richard Briers, Jimmy Edwards, Ted Moult, Bobby Charlton, Lord Litchfield and Sir Frank Whittle. In August 1992 her work was shown at the Czech Embassy in London as part of an exhibition devoted to the work of five distinguished Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 sculptors.\nShe was married several times, lastly to the sculptor Franta Belsky, who died in 2000.\nIn late 2010, visual artist Aleksandra Mir befriended Sedleck\u00e1. A series of interviews in the following spring led to the publication of a monograph on Sedleck\u00e1's life and work together with an unsolicited proposal of bringing the statue, now exiled in Montreux, back to London on temporary loan and to place it on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square.\nSedleck\u00e1 died in London on 4 August 2020, aged 91.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sherlock Holmes", "response": ["There are multiple statues of Sherlock Holmes around the world.

A sculpture depicting both Holmes and Watson was unveiled in 2007 in Moscow, Russia, based partially on Sidney Paget's illustrations and partially on the actors in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. In 2015, a sculpture of Holmes by Jane DeDecker was installed in the police headquarters of Edmond, Oklahoma, United States. In 2019, a statue of Holmes was unveiled in Chester, Illinois, United States, as part of a series of statues honouring cartoonist E. C. Segar and his characters.

Two centuries later it served as model for a 2002 statue of Brummell by Irena Sedleck\u00e1 erected in Jermyn Street. A plaque on the front of this statue is inscribed with these words of his: 'to be truly elegant one should not be noticed'. On the other side of Piccadilly, a blue plaque has marked Brummell's former home in Chesterfield Street since 1984, while in 2013 another plaque commemorated his name as a member of the hunting and dining club in Melton Mowbray also patronised by the Prince Regent."]}, {"page": "Made in Heaven", "response": ["The cover for the album has two different photos: the CD cover photo was shot at dusk, depicting Irena Sedleck\u00e1's Mercury sculpture located at Lake Geneva in Montreux, Switzerland, on the front, with May, Taylor and Deacon gazing at the Alps on the rear cover; meanwhile, the LP cover photo was shot in the same spot at dawn, depicting the same statue on the front but with May, Taylor and Deacon gazing at the sunrise on the rear cover.", "*Richard Gray \u2013 artwork, cover photograph of Irena Sedleck\u00e1's Mercury sculpture in Montreux"]}, {"page": "Franta Belsky", "response": ["In 1944, he married Margaret Owen the newspaper cartoonist, who signed her own work Belsky.
