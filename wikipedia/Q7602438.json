The results are moody [...], pretty [...] and uniformly catchy.\" In a mixed review, Claire Allfree of Metro viewed the album as \"undeniably pretty aerated synthpop\", but felt that \"Goulding's girly, heartfelt voice is oddly depthless, while the electronic vapour and four-to-the-floor house beats swoop in a wash of perfectly calibrated bland sound.\" Mark Beaumont of NME expressed that \"there's nothing here groundbreaking enough to justify the critical frothing. It's largely straight-ahead folk-pop dappled with a mild ground-frost of sequenced beats, Auto-Tune, and synth sizzles.\" David Renshaw of Drowned in Sound stated that \"Lights sounds like a na\u00efve folk album given a blog house remix\" and concluded, \"Devoid of a true soul or sense of honesty Lights can be a pretty hollow listen.\" The Guardians Alexis Petridis was unimpressed, dismissing the album as \"general acoustic singer-songwriter material\".", "* Starsmith \u2013 keyboards, drum programming ; bass ; saxophone ", "* Starsmith \u2013 production ", "* Starsmith \u2013 programming, acoustic guitar, bass, electric guitar, backing vocals ", "* Starsmith \u2013 production "]}, {"page": "Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree", "response": ["Braide also collaborated with Vickers on three other tracks, \"Me & You\", \"Four Leaf Clover\" and \"N.U.M.B\", which were recorded at the songwriter-producer's London studio.
