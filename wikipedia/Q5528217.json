He is the host of the podcast Get Off My Lawn, on the online video platform Censored.TV,  which he founded. He co-founded Vice in 1994 at the age of 24, and relocated to the United States in 2001. In more recent years, he has drawn attention for his far-right political activism and his role as the founder of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist white supremacist organization designated as a terrorist group in Canada. McInnes has been accused of promoting violence against political opponents, but has claimed that he only has supported political violence in self-defense and that he is not far-right or a supporter of fascism.Born to Scottish parents in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England, McInnes immigrated to Canada as a child. He graduated from Carleton University in Ottawa before moving to Montreal and co-founding Vice with Suroosh Alvi and Shane Smith. He relocated with Vice Media to New York City in 2001.During his time at Vice, McInnes was called a leading figure in the New York hipster subculture. After leaving Vice in 2008, McInnes became increasingly known for his far-right political views. He is the founder of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist, men's rights and male-only organisation classified as a \"general hate\" organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He has rejected this classification, claiming that the group is \"not an extremist group and [does] not have ties with white nationalists\". He holds both Canadian and British citizenship and lives in Larchmont, New York.In 2018, McInnes was fired from Blaze Media, and was banned from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for violating terms of use related to promoting violent extremist groups and hate speech. In June 2020, McInnes's account was suspended from YouTube for violating YouTube's policies concerning hate speech, posting content that was \"glorifying [and] inciting violence against another person or group of people.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southern Poverty Law Center", "response": ["In February 2019, several months after resigning as chaiman of the Proud Boys, Gavin McInnes filed a defamation lawsuit against the SPLC.

The SPLC took the lawsuit \"as a compliment\" and an indication that \"we're doing our job.\" On its website, SPLC said that \"McInnes plays a duplicitous rhetorical game: rejecting white nationalism and, in particular, the term 'alt-right' while espousing some of its central tenets\" and that the group's \"rank-and-file [members] and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists. They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Proud Boys have appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings like the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\" McInnes is represented by Ronald Coleman. In addition to defamation, McInnes claimed tortious interference with economic advantage, \"false light invasion of privacy\" and \"aiding and abetting employment discrimination.\" The day after filing the suit, McInnes announced that he had been re-hired by the Canadian far-right media group The Rebel Media. The SPLC filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in July 2019.Cushing, Tim (July 11, 2019). \"SPLC Asks Court To Toss Proud Boy Founder's Defamation Lawsuit By Asking 'Where's The Lie?'\". TechDirt. .

In 2020, Malkin faced criticism for speaking at the America First Political Action Conference, which is hosted by white nationalist Nick Fuentes and also featured Patrick Casey, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Identity Evropa.
