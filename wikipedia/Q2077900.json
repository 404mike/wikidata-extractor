Potts (academic)", "response": ["In 1979 Potts joined the academic staff at the Department of Civil Engineering at Imperial College and was responsible for research and teaching  in the field of numerical and analytical methods in geomechanics. At Imperial College, Potts worked with and was influenced by Professors Peter Rolfe Vaughan and John Burland. Since 1998, he holds the position of Professor of Analytical Soil Mechanics and of Head of Geotechnics. Professor Potts has worked extensively on the development of computer methods of analysis and, more particularly, on the application of elasto-plastic finite element programs to the analysis of real geotechnical structures.Professor David M. Potts - Research His consulting work has been concerned with the design of piles, including tension piles for offshore anchored structures, the response of offshore gravity platform foundations to cyclic loading, retaining structures of various types, cut-and-cover tunnels, bored tunnels, culverts subject to mining subsidence, the stability of embankments on soft ground, the stability and deformation of earth dams, the behaviour of reinforced earth structures, the prediction of ground movements around deep excavations and the role of progressive failure in embankment and cut slope problems."]}]}}
