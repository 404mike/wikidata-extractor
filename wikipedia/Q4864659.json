Reed was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm slow.\nReed made his first-class debut for Hampshire in 1958 against Cambridge University. It would then be seven years before Reed would represent Hampshire again in 1965, making his County Championship debut against Lancashire. Reed represented Hampshire in 122 first-class matches from 1965 to 1970, with his final appearance for the county coming against Nottinghamshire in the 1970 County Championship. Reed also played one-day cricket for Hampshire, with his one-day debut coming in the 1966 Gillette Cup against Lincolnshire. From 1966 to 1972, Reed played 32 one day matches for Hampshire, with his final one-day game coming against Kent in the 1972 John Player League.\nIn his 122 first-class matches for the county, Reed scored 4,910 runs at a batting average of 24.30, with 29 half centuries, 2 centuries and a high score of 138 against Oxford University in 1970. In addition Reed took 57 catches in the field for the county.\nIn Reed's 32 one-day matches for the county he scored 900 runs at a batting average of 36.00, with 1 half century, 2 centuries and a high score 143* against Buckinghamshire in 1970.\nIn addition to playing first-class matches for Hampshire, Reed also represented the Marylebone Cricket Club in a single first-class match in 1966 against Ireland on the Marylebone Cricket Club's tour of Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoff Keith", "response": ["There were more matches but a different batting position in 1965: Barry Reed and Mike Barnard became Marshall's more regular opening partners, while Keith resumed batting in the middle order. His aggregate for the season at 561 runs was lower than in 1964, but his average had improved to 26.75 and the season included the only century of his career, an unbeaten 101 in the match against the South African touring side. His little used off-spin also got its best reward in the 1965 season, with four wickets for 49 runs in Gloucestershire's first innings in the match at Bristol."]}, {"page": "Barry Reed", "response": ["Barry Reed may refer to:", "* Barry Reed (author) (1927\u20132002), American trial lawyer and bestselling author", "* Barry Reed (cricketer) (born 1937), former English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Barry Reed, cricketer, was born in Southsea"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Barry Reed (1966) : B.
