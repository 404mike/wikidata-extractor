Smith was primarily a midfielder, but could also play at full back. Smith made 200 appearances in all competitions for both Hibs and Leicester.Smith started his professional career with Hibs, where he played a part in the successful teams of the early and mid-1970s. Smith attracted the attention of Rangers manager Jock Wallace by scoring a spectacular goal for Hibs against Rangers in a 1976 match. Wallace became Leicester City manager in 1978, and signed Smith for an \u00a385,000 transfer fee later that year. Smith helped Leicester win promotion to the top division twice during his spell with the club. He regularly captained Leicester during his eight years there.He was loaned to Peterborough and Hibs during the 1982\u201383 season, and then returned to Hibs on a \"permanent\" basis in 1986. After leaving Hibs for the final time in 1987, Smith played a prominent defensive role for a Dunfermline side that gained promotion to the Premier Division, but was released at the end of that season.After ending his career with spells at Partick Thistle and Berwick Rangers, Smith became a taxi driver, and later ran a pub in Dalkeith called Smith's Bar. He died in February 2010 after suffering from cancer, less than a week after former teammate Alan Gordon died from the same illness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dalkeith", "response": ["* Bobby Smith (1953\u20132010), footballer with Hibernian and Leicester City"]}, {"page": "Robert Smith", "response": ["* Bobby Smith (rhythm and blues singer) (1936\u20132013), lead singer of the (Detroit) Spinners", "*Bobby Smith (safety) (born 1938), American football defensive back", "*Bobby Smith (running back) (born 1942), American football running back", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1870), played one game for Stoke", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1900s), Scottish footballer", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1933) (1933\u20132010), English footballer for Tottenham Hotspur", "* Bobby Smith (Irish footballer) (1922\u20131992), football player for Bohemians", "* Bobby Smith (Canadian soccer) (born 1940), Canadian soccer player", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1941) (1941\u20132019), English footballer for Barnsley F.C. and Chelmsford City F.C.", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1944), English footballer and manager", "* Bobby Smith (American soccer) (born 1951), American soccer player", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1953), for Hibernian and Leicester City", "*Bobby Smith (baseball) (1934\u20132015), MLB outfielder, 1957\u20131965", "*Bobby Smith (basketball) (1937\u20132020), American basketball player", "* Bobby Smith (ice hockey) (born 1958), all-star NHL hockey player", "* Bobby Smith (javelin thrower) (born 1982), American javelin thrower", "* Bobby Smith (activist) (born 1982), political and fathers' rights activist"]}, {"page": "2010 in association football", "response": ["* 22 February - Bobby Smith, Scottish footballer (56)", "* 18 September - Bobby Smith, English striker (77, after a short illness)"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 in English football", "response": ["*22 February 2010 \u2013 Bobby Smith, 56, former midfielder who spent eight seasons at Leicester City between 1978 and 1986, and also had a long career in his native Scotland, mostly with Hibernian and Dunfermline Athletic.Bobby Smith obituary, Hibernian FC official site.
