Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond of the K Foundation received media coverage for the award of the \"Anti-Turner Prize\", \u00a340,000 to be given to the \"worst artist in Britain\", voted from the real Turner Prize's short-list. Rachel Whiteread was awarded their prize. She refused to accept the money at first, but changed her mind when she heard the cash was to be burned instead, and gave \u00a330,000 of it to artists in financial need and the other \u00a310,000 to the housing charity, Shelter. The K Foundation went on to make a film in which they burned \u00a31\u00a0million of their own money (Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid).

Their financing enabled Artscribe to become a colour glossy. Collings continued his policy of internationalism, bringing in articles and reviews from the United States and continental Europe to mix with coverage of British art. He also set up a group of contributing editors based abroad, and persuaded high-profile artists to make unique cover-images and 'artist's pages' for the magazine.  These included glamorous figures of the moment such as George Condo, Julian Schnabel, Markus L\u00fcpertz, Albert Oehlen, , Jean-Michel Basquiat, Eric Fischl and Nancy Spero, but also worthy Brits, such as Art & Language, Hannah Collins, Ian McKeever and Gerard Hemsworth. In 1987 Collings received a commendation for his transformation of Artscribe from the Turner Prize jury (other art-world figures singled out for commendation that year were Nicholas Serota, soon to be director of the Tate). Collings was fired as editor by the owners later that year after an argument with one of the office staff. (He went on to write and present popular TV programmes on art and now combines TV work with painting.)"]}, {"page": "List of Turner Prize winners and nominees", "response": ["|Hannah CollinsVong PhaophanitSean Scully"]}, {"page": "Source (photography magazine)", "response": ["Hannah Collins,"]}, {"page": "James Mackay (film producer)", "response": ["In 1981, he established a production and distribution company Dark Picture, specializing in new film and video, and thus began his collaboration with Derek Jarman.
