He was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium-fast.\nMcIntosh was educated at Uppingham School in Rutland, where he played for the school cricket team and for three years he was the mainstay of their bowling attack, captaining the side in 1926, a season in which he took 45 wickets at a bowling average of 11.45. He later went to University College, Oxford, where he played for the University Cricket Club, making his first-class debut in 1927 against the Harlequins. 1927 was also the year that McIntosh played his only first-class match for the West of England when they played the touring New Zealanders at the County Ground, Exeter; additionally in 1927 he also made three appearances for Devon in the Minor Counties Championship. From 1927 to 1929, McIntosh made 21 first-class appearances for Oxford University, playing his final match for them against Surrey.McIntosh received his Oxford Blue in his first year of 1927, thanks largely to an injury to Walter McBride, and in 1928. Poor health and having to bowl on over-prepared wickets which led to a poor bowling season for him in 1929 ruled him out of contention for a Blue in that year. A bowler, he took 62 wickets in total for the University. These came at an average of 34.33 and included two five wicket hauls, with best figures of 5/52.McIntosh later returned to the British Raj, where he played a single first-class match each for the Europeans (India) against the Indians and for Madras against the Marylebone Cricket Club, both in 1934. He died in Budleigh Salterton, Devon on 21 March 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert McIntosh", "response": ["Robert McIntosh or derivatives may refer to:", "*Robert McIntosh (cricketer) (1907\u20131988), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "West of England cricket team", "response": ["* Robert McIntosh (1927)"]}, {"page": "List of Tamil Nadu cricketers", "response": ["* Robert McIntosh, 1933/34"]}]}}
