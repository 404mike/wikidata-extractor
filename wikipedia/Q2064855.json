This contrasts with Zoe's more formal style. The novel discusses the microcosm of the 'chippies' and the 'subbies' in order to discuss the ridge between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in a dystopian future where those living in cities do not have suffrage, and the elite suburb-dewellers control the nation."]}, {"page": "Invisible!", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Swindells"]}, {"page": "Abomination (novel)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Swindells"]}, {"page": "Abomination (Novel)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Swindells "]}, {"page": "Homelessness in popular culture", "response": ["*1993.
