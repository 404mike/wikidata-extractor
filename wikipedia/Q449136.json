Her early novels earned her a reputation for sensationalism, which meant her later, stronger work tended to be neglected by critics, although she was described as a queen of the circulating libraries.\nHer novel Dear Faustina (1897) has been noted for its homoeroticism. Her novel Lavinia (1902) depicts a seemingly \"unmanly\" young man, who wishes he had been born as a woman instead. \nBroughton was a descendant of the Broughton baronets, as a granddaughter of the 8th baronet. She was the niece of Sheridan le Fanu, who helped her start her literary career. Broughton was a longtime friend of fellow writer Henry James, and was noted for her adversarial relationship with both Lewis Carroll and Oscar Wilde.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Feminist science fiction", "response": ["Virginia Wolf relates to this aspect of feminist science fiction in the article \"Feminist Criticism and Science Fiction for Children\". As she discusses the scarcity of women in the field, she states, \"During the first period, that of the nineteenth century, apparently only two women wrote Science Fiction, Mary Shelley and Rhoda Broughton,\" and continues, \"In the early twentieth century, a few women were successful Science Fiction writers\". But, \"The times changed. Repression gave way to questioning and outright rebellion, and in the Science Fiction of the 1960s stylistic innovations and new concerns emerged 'Many of their stories, instead of dealing with the traditional hardware of science fiction, concentrated on the effects that different societies or perceptions would have on individual characters'\".  Andre Norton, a semi-well known analyst of Science fiction argues along these lines as well. As Norton explored one or more novels she came across, she realized that the creation of characters and how they are shown is a clear connection to the real world situation. From here, she goes in depth of characters in these feminist novels and relates them to the real world. She concludes here article along these lines. She wanted to get the idea out that feminists have a way to get their voice out there. Now, all their works are famous/ popular enough for their ideas to be let out. Virginia Wolf can attest to this fact. She introduced the idea that women were not represented well in the field till the early 1900s and added to the fact by stating, \"Women are not represented well in Science Fiction\"."]}, {"page": "June 5", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 Rhoda Broughton, Welsh-English author (b. 1840)"]}, {"page": "Sheridan Le Fanu", "response": ["Both his grandmother Alicia Sheridan Le Fanu and his great-uncle Richard Brinsley Sheridan were playwrights (his niece Rhoda Broughton would become a successful novelist), and his mother was also a writer, producing a biography of Charles Orpen.
