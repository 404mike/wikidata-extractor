Her early novels earned her a reputation for sensationalism, which meant her later, stronger work tended to be neglected by critics, although she was described as a queen of the circulating libraries.\nHer novel Dear Faustina (1897) has been noted for its homoeroticism. Her novel Lavinia (1902) depicts a seemingly \"unmanly\" young man, who wishes he had been born as a woman instead. \nBroughton was a descendant of the Broughton baronets, as a granddaughter of the 8th baronet. She was the niece of Sheridan le Fanu, who helped her start her literary career. Broughton was a longtime friend of fellow writer Henry James, and was noted for her adversarial relationship with both Lewis Carroll and Oscar Wilde.", "link_mentions": {}}}
