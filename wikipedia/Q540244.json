He was ordained at Far West, Missouri in April 1839 where the other members of the Quorum of the Twelve had traveled. He suffered from malaria in Commerce, Missouri during the July epidemic. In 1839 he and John Taylor were the first two of the apostles to leave from the Nauvoo/Montrose area to go on missions to Britain. He spent over a month in the Staffordshire Potteries and then travelled to Herefordshire, where he preached to members of the United Brethren. Almost all of the members of the United Brethren converted to Mormonism. Outside of London, the missionary work in England was very successful, and by August 1840 there were around 800 members, with local members acting as leadership and proselyting missionaries. Preaching in London was difficult, and Woodruff had dreams about serpents attacking him before he and his companions were able to baptize forty-nine people. Membership in England did not stay there, since many converts left to join the other members in the United States. When he left England in April 1841, 140 members joined him in journeying to New York. Woodruff met Phebe in Maine, and they traveled to Nauvoo together in October 1841.", "In Nauvoo, the Twelve Apostles assigned Woodruff to assist with the church's temporal matters in Nauvoo. He became co-manager of Times and Seasons in February 1842. Woodruff supervised the physical printing of the paper, and he and John Taylor also published a general interest newspaper called Nauvoo Neighbor starting in May 1843. He bought and sold real estate, helped clerk in a provision store, and farmed. He became a member of the Nauvoo city council and served as chaplain for the Nauvoo Legion, a local militia. He also helped to organize the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge and the Nauvoo Agricultural and Manufacturing Society. As a member of the Twelve Apostles, he was also a member of the Council of Fifty. He took detailed notes on the King Follett discourse. He joined the other Twelve Apostles in a trip to the east coast to raise funds for a temple and hotel under construction in Nauvoo, setting out in July 1843 and returning in November 1843. Woodruff and his wife Phebe received their second anointing in Nauvoo in 1844, making them members of the Anointed Quorum. In May 1844, Woodruff left on another trip to preach and promote Joseph Smith's presidential campaign. News of Joseph Smith's death reached Woodruff on July 9, and fellow apostles returned to Nauvoo in August.", "After Brigham Young's death in August 1877, John Taylor became the new president of the church and Woodruff became president of the Twelve Apostles. Woodruff chaired the committee to separate Brigham Young's personal property from church property, finding that Brigham Young owed the church almost $700,000 in real-estate and other expenses. In 1879, George Reynolds was convicted of polygamy in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Utah's U.S. marshal started looking for Woodruff, and Woodruff fled to Bunkerville, Nevada, and northern Arizona and New Mexico. A new supreme court ruling required the federal government to provide positive evidence of polygamy before convicting the husband, and Woodruff could appear in public again until the 1882 when the Edmunds Act was passed. The Edmunds Act outlawed unlawful cohabitation, which was easier to prove than polygamy, and church leadership advised men in polygamous marriages to live in one house with one wife. Prosecution of polygamous men began in earnest in 1884, and Woodruff went into hiding in St. George during 1885 and often wore a dress and sunbonnet as a disguise. He was able to visit Phebe before her death on November 9, 1885, but fearing arrest, did not attend her funeral, instead watching it from the president's office. After Phebe's death, he lived at Emma's house or with friends.", "After the death of John Taylor in July 1887, Woodruff assumed leadership of the church as the senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Woodruff wanted to reorganize the First Presidency right away, continuing with George Q. Cannon as first counselor. Other members of the Quorum took this opportunity to raise grievances against Cannon, stating that he had defended his son John Q. too vigorously during his excommunication, to the point of hiding his crimes. The Twelve Apostles with Woodruff as its president presided over the church until the Quorum came to an agreement in April 1889. After George Q. Cannon apologized to the Quorum, they approved his appointment as first counselor. In 1887, the new U.S. marshal, Frank H. Dyer, told Woodruff he would not arrest him, and Woodruff could make public appearances again in Salt Lake City. Outside of Salt Lake City, deputy marshals vigorously hunted down suspected polygamists, being paid more with more convicts. In an effort to appear attractive to the federal government for statehood, Woodruff counseled local press not to excessively criticize the federal government, and asked missionaries in the southeastern United States to soften their approach to decrease complaints from local ministers. He also asked leaders to stop preaching the practice of plural marriage. On behalf of the church, Woodruff courted the favor of businessman Alexander Badlam Jr. and prominent Republican Isaac Trumbo. The two men moved to Arlington, Virginia, under false names, seeking to persuade Republican congressmen to support Utah's bid for statehood in 1888. After Utah was denied statehood, Woodruff personally traveled to California in 1889 to speak with politicians."]}, {"page": "Brigham Young (film)", "response": ["* George Melford as John Taylor"]}, {"page": "Emma Smith", "response": ["On March 17, 1842, the Ladies' Relief Society of Nauvoo was formally organized as the women's auxiliary to the church. Emma became its founding president, with Sarah M. Cleveland and Elizabeth Ann Whitney as her counselors. She had persuaded John Taylor and Joseph Smith to call the organization the \"Relief Society\" instead of the \"Benevolent Society\". The Latter-Day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia records that Emma Smith \"filled [the position] with marked distinction as long as the society continued to hold meetings in that city [Nauvoo].\" She saw upholding morality as the primary purpose of the Relief Society. As \"protecting the morals of the community\" became her mission, Smith supported the public confession of sins; on this subject, Smith called the women of Nauvoo to repentance with \"all the frankness of a Methodist exhorter.\" She served as president of the Relief Society until 1844. According to the minutes of the founding meeting, the organization was formed to \"provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor, [search] after objects of charity [and] to assist by correcting the virtues of the female community\". Shortly before this, Joseph had initiated the Anointed Quorum\u2014a prayer circle of important church members that included Emma. As she had in Kirtland, Emma Smith lead \"the work of boarding and clothing the men engaged in building [the Nauvoo temple]\".

He is considered by many to have been the first African-American elder and seventy in the Latter Day Saint movement. Abel, although predominantly of Scotch and English descent, appears by his African heritage to have been the first and one of the few black members in the early history of the church to have received the priesthood. And it was his distinction to be the faith's first missionary to have descended in part through African bloodline. Abel did not have his priesthood revoked when the Church began its priesthood ban for black men but he was denied by third Church President John Taylor a chance to receive his Temple endowment. As a skilled carpenter, Abel often committed his services to the furthering of the work and to the building of LDS temples. He died in 1884, shortly after serving a final mission for the church (in his lifetime he officially served three) to Cincinnati, Ohio.", "Tragedy struck the family in 1871 when firstborn Moroni \u2014 son of Elijah and Mary's youth who had crossed the plains with them and just entered manhood \u2014 died.

Stevenson, \"and Ables [sic] approached John Taylor, his successor, again requesting his endowment,\" but it was again withheld from him.", "Although Abel remained a faithful member of the church his entire life, he was not exempt from discrimination that existed in his church and state. His membership, participation, and leadership in the church both during and after his Illinois and Ohio years was frequently questioned and challenged. After moving to Utah Territory, Abel asked Brigham Young for permission to be sealed to his wife and children, which was denied. Abel again requested a sealing five years later to his deceased wife, son, and daughter, this time from President John Taylor, who then passed it on for the body of the Twelve to consider. But his request was again refused, and neither was he allowed to enter the temple to be endowed.", "While there were yet no attempts to take away Abel's priesthood authority, that authority was questioned by church leaders. In 1879, a meeting was held on Saturday, 31 May, at the residence of Provo mayor Abraham O. Smoot to discuss the conflicting versions of Joseph Smith's views on blacks and the priesthood in response to Abel's petition to be sealed to his recently deceased wife. President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles John Taylor, his secretary L. John Nuttall, mayor Smoot, apostle Brigham Young, Jr. (son of the late prophet), and Zebedee Coltrin were in attendance. According to Nuttall, who detailed the meeting in his journal, Coltrin and Smoot made statements about all they could recollect Joseph Smith having ever said about blacks and the priesthood.", "John Taylor recounted a story he had remembered and then asked Coltrin to confirm if the account was accurate. In this story, Coltrin had at one time remarked that black people should not have the priesthood, to which Smith had responded with the account of the Apostle Peter's vision in Acts 10, in which he was commanded by God to \"not call any man common or unclean\" and to teach the Gentiles despite being a Jew himself, implying that blacks should have the priesthood. However, Coltrin denied that this conversation had ever taken place. Though it would seem apparent that the Prophet himself related the story to Taylor, the recorded minutes of the meeting do not make it clear where Taylor originally heard the story.", "By meeting's end, John Taylor \u2014 concluding at last that Joseph Smith had made \"an exception\" and had given Abel the priesthood despite his race, perhaps because he was an Octoroon (or one-eighth black) and perhaps also, as per Coltrin's testimony, because he had further proved his worthiness by helping to advance and to build the early church \u2014 decided that Abel's priesthood would be \"allowed to remain.\""]}, {"page": "Black people and Mormonism", "response": ["Young once taught that the devil was black, and his successor as church president, John Taylor, taught on multiple occasions that the reason that black people (those with the curse of Cain) were allowed to survive the flood was so that the devil could be properly represented on the earth through the children of Ham and his wife Egyptus.
