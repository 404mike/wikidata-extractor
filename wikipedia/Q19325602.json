The case concerned the death of 15-year-old Reginald Cancellor (some sources give his name as Chancellor and his age as 13 or 14) at the hands of his teacher, Thomas Hopley. Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor's part, but instead beat the boy to death.\nAn inquest into Cancellor's death began when his brother requested an autopsy. As a result of the inquest Hopley was arrested and charged with manslaughter. He was found guilty at trial and sentenced to four years in prison, although he insisted that his actions were justifiable and that he was not guilty of any crime. The trial was sensationalised by the Victorian press and incited debate over the use of corporal punishment in schools. After Hopley's release and subsequent divorce trial, he largely disappeared from the public record. The case became an important legal precedent in the United Kingdom for discussions of corporal punishment in schools and reasonable limits on discipline.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Catherine Cooper Hopley", "response": ["Hopley was born in Whitstable, Kent, the only daughter among four children to parents Edward Hopley (1780\u20131841), a surgeon, and  Catherine Cooper Prat (1792\u20131878).

Her youngest brother Thomas Hopley (1819\u20131876) was a schoolteacher convicted in the beating death of a student in the Eastbourne manslaughter trial.
