He has regularly worked and toured with Lloyd Cole post-Commotions including playing on and touring in support of Cole's 2006 album, Antidepressant. He also worked on Cole's albums Bad Vibes, Love Story, Etc, Music in a Foreign Language, and Guesswork. Clark was a member of Bloomsday with Stephen Irvine of the Commotions and Chris Thomson of The Bathers. Clark features on the Bathers' 1993 album, Lagoon Blues. He collaborated with Canadian singer Mae Moore on her album Dragonfly - his guitar playing featured on her single \"Genuine\", which reached No. 6 on the RPM \"Top 100\" singles chart in Canada. In 1995 and 1998 he worked on two albums with French singer Axelle Renoir.\nTwo songs, co-written by Clark for Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, have been covered by other artists: \"Rattlesnakes\", by Tori Amos and \"(Are You) Ready to Be Heartbroken?\", by Sandie Shaw.\nHe lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and has released two solo albums, Sundogs in 2008 and Second Story Sunlight in 2010. Both albums mix minimalist and cinematic guitar styles with ambient electronica. He currently also plays and writes with Ambrose Pottie (drums) and Alisdair Jones (bass) in post-jazz trio, Sleepers.\nClark toured the UK, Ireland, France, New-Zealand, Australia with Lloyd Cole in an acoustic concert at multiple venues in October, November and December 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lloyd Cole", "response": ["Love Story (1995) established stripped-down, largely acoustic sound landscapes with the help of Stephen Street (known for his work with Blur and The Smiths) and former Commotion Neil Clark; the album produced a minor hit with the song \"Like Lovers Do\", affording Cole a mid-1990s appearance on Top of the Pops. However, following a massive purge of the artist roster that came with Universal Music's takeover of PolyGram and Cole's disappointment with the label, his contract was terminated, despite at least two full-length recordings being locked in its vaults (later released in 2002 by One Little Indian). Love Story was a Top 30 hit in the UK. ", "In 2004, to mark the 20th anniversary of the release of Rattlesnakes, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions reformed to perform a one-off tour of the UK and Ireland.  The reformation was never intended to be permanent, and Cole released another solo album in 2006, Antidepressant, using his usual home recording outfit by playing all the instruments himself with friends like Sobule, Derby and the guitar work of former Commotion Neil Clark on some tracks. The album included fan favourites 'Woman in a Bar' and 'The Young Idealists' a.o. Lloyd has mentioned 'Rolodex Incident' as a personal favourite.", "A new studio album, Guesswork, was released on 26 July 2019 by earMUSIC. Recorded (mostly) in his attic studio in Massachusetts, \u2018Guesswork\u2019 was produced by Lloyd and mixed by maverick German producer Olaf Opal, with executive production from Chris Hughes. The record was mastered by Kai Blankenberg at Skyline Tonfabrik in Dusseldorf. The electronic sounding album also featured contributions from a.o. Fred Maher and former Commotions Blair Cowan and Neil Clark. It was preceded by the singles 'Violins' and ' Night Sweats'. The former was accompanied by a video, as was album opener 'The Over Under', which gained a video directed by John Wood and Paul Harrison.

Recorded with a core band of Thomson, Sam Loup (bass), Jon Turner (keyboards) and James Locke (drums), it gained an enthusiastic critical reception, but label politics limited its success. Thomson went back to the drawing board, changed record labels, and released the follow-up Sweet Deceit on Island Records in 1990, to further critical acclaim. Thomson then took time out from The Bathers to work with two former members of Lloyd Cole and the Commotions (Neil Clark and Stephen Irvine) and Madness bass player Mark Bedford in the one-off band Bloomsday, who released their lone album Fortuny in 1990.", "Returning to The Bathers, Thompson signed to the German label Marina Records, which would go on to release three albums by the band \u2013 Lagoon Blues (1993), Sunpowder (1995) and Kelvingrove Baby (1997). Working from a floating membership (which still included James Grant, Neil Clark and James Locke) The Bathers now featured string players and arrangers Mark Wilson and Iain White, keyboard player Carlo Scattini and drummer/percussionist Hazel Morrison (who also added operatic soprano backing vocals). Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins recorded several tracks with the band on 1995's Sunpowder, and performed live with them in Glasgow. Although Thomson enjoyed a good relationship with Marina, he felt that a label nearer home would be preferable: consequently, The Bathers' sixth album Pandemonia appeared on Wrasse Records in 1999."]}, {"page": "Neil Clark (guitarist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Neil Clark (musician)"]}, {"page": "Mainstream (Lloyd Cole and the Commotions album)", "response": ["#\"From the Hip\" (Neil Clark, Cole, Blair Cowan, Lawrence Donegan, Stephen Irvine, McKillop) \u2013 3:57", "*Neil Clark \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Stephen Irvine", "response": ["Stephen Irvine (born 1959) is a Scottish musician, formerly a member of Lloyd Cole and the Commotions.
