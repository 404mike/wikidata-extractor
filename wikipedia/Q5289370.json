I really enjoyed being that person, feeling what it's like to be intimidating.\" The film was made by Mortimer's friend, Dolly Wells, in her directorial debut. The actor's performance earned praise, but several critics were disappointed with her amount of screen time. Next, she appeared in Greg Kinnear's comedy Phil; it was negatively received by critics. In the horror film Mary, Mortimer starred opposite Gary Oldman. The film is about a family in isolated waters and the ship they bought which has terrifying secrets.
