She thought she had a winning method for the gambling tables. They took with them her niece Isabelle Giraudin. They also used the titles of \"Sir\" Vere and \"Lady\" Goold, which they claimed they were entitled to use. According to a book by Charles Kingston, their system did not work, but Leonard Gribble's account suggests that it worked for at least a couple of days or a week. However, the Goolds soon were without funds. At the casino, they met a wealthy Swedish woman, Emma Levin, the widow of a Stockholm broker. Mrs Levin already had a friend named Madame Castellazi accompanying her, but soon the widow had Mrs. Goold as well. The two \"hangers-on\" detested each other, and finally had a public dispute in the casino. This got into the social columns at Monte Carlo, and Madame Levin decided she had to leave the city because of the publicity.", "* Leonard Gribble \"Adventures in Murder, Undertaken by Some Notorious Killers in Love\" (New York: Roy Publisher, no date), p.\u00a076\u201385: Chapter VIII: \"Duet in Monte Carlo\"."]}, {"page": "Louis Grey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leonard Gribble"]}, {"page": "The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (novel)", "response": ["The Arsenal Stadium Mystery is a novel by Leonard Gribble.
