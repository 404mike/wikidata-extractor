"]}, {"page": "History of The Bill", "response": ["Following his arrival in 2005, Johnathan Young reduced the amount of personal and sensational storylines and shifted the programme's focus to more crime-based stories. Similar to Richard Handford in the late 90s and early 2000s, Young's plots were a mix of crime-based policing drama and personal issues, although they normally stemmed from policing, such as DC Zain Nadir falling for his target Kristen Shaw whilst working undercover with a gang of drug runners. Episode titles were reintroduced beginning with Episode #490, Sweet Revenge, broadcast on 21 March 2007. A spokesperson for the programme commented on how the titles summed up the 'essence' of an episode. The return of episode titles followed a title sequence change on January 3, 2007, paying homage to the original 1984 titles by featuring shots of London, interspersed with police work and shots of Sun Hill Police Station; the break bumpers and music were also updated. By that time the serial format was largely dropped and stories became more self-contained, with those that were serialised broadcast over two or three episode blocks. Young also axed a number of fringe characters such as civilian staff and non-police officer characters, while those he felt lacked the longevity required for the series including PC Steve Hunter, DC Suzie Sim and Superintendent Adam Okaro. However, the decision to axe PC Reg Hollis after 24 years in 2008 proved highly controversial, and led the character's devastated actor Jeff Stewart to attempt suicide. 2008 also saw the series celebrate its 25th anniversary with Proof of Life, a crossover with German drama Leipzig Homicide.", "In another controversial move just under two years after Jeff Stewart was axed, 22-year show veteran PC Tony Stamp was sacked by the show's producers soon after the revamp, stating they felt Stamp did not 'fit in with the show's new dynamic'; actor Graham Cole said he was devastated to leave the show, having been a regular since 1988 and an extra from 1984.

The other exit was that of Inspector Gina Gold; having been a hard as nails, iron-fisted manager during her time on the show, the character of Gold began to crumble under pressure out of fear of losing another officer, having been close friends with Keane. This came to light in the episode Lifesaver, in which Sgt. Stone and PC Armstrong rescued a suicidal woman from her car that had crashed into the River Thames, and again in the episode Demolition Girl when Armstrong is almost crushed by the debris of an imploding tower block tried to stop a woman running back into the building.
