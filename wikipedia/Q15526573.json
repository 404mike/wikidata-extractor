This led to discussions between Mather and former Rangers director Dave King over the latter's potential investment in the club and Rangers manager, Ally McCoist agreeing to take a substantial pay-cut. Mather's meeting with King caused unease in the Rangers boardroom and was thought to be the reason behind his removal as chief executive on 16 October leaving only two directors on the Plc board. The lack of corporate governance was criticised by Rangers nominated adviser and led to the appointment of David Somers as non-executive director and acting chairman a few weeks later. On the same day as Somers' appointment, the date for the AGM was set for 19 December. This instigated an arms race between warring factions for control of Rangers. In the five weeks prior to the AGM, the board proceeded to appoint Norman Crighton as non-executive director, Graham Wallace as the new chief executive and confirmed Somers as permanent chairman, much to the bemusement of the requisitioners who questioned the appointments so close to the AGM. Around this time, going perhaps unnoticed, was the news that Police Scotland was investigating whether former owner Craig Whyte was still involved at Rangers as well as the acquisition and management of the club. Perhaps the most important machinations involved moves by the board to secure support from other shareholders and their voting rights, with the largest single shareholder Laxey Partners indicating its  support for the current board at the AGM. A week before the AGM it was clear that the board had amassed a sizeable proportion of voting rights, which ultimately, saw them re-elected and the requisitioners defeated."]}, {"page": "David Somers", "response": ["David Somers may refer to:", "* David Somers (businessman) (born 1948), Chairman of Rangers Football Club", "* David Somers (referee) (born 1966), Scottish football referee"]}, {"page": "David Somers (Scottish businessman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Somers (businessman)"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["When offers of funding from Dave King, a \u00a316m package, and Brian Kennedy were rejected by Rangers\u2019 hierarchy, who instead opted Mike Ashley's \u00a32m loan offer, it was clear who was victorious.
