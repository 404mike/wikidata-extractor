In the Premier League Cup they suffered a shock semi final defeat to Birmingham City, collapsing from 3\u20131 ahead to lose 4\u20133 to the Northern Division leaders. The Belles knocked holders Arsenal out of the Women's FA Cup in the quarter finals, ending a run of six successive defeats\u2014stretching back almost two years\u2014against their old rivals. The BBC reported that the final whistle was \"joyously celebrated\" by the Doncaster Belles players.
