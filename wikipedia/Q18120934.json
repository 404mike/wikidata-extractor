From a young age she attended the ladies' gallery of the House of Commons, while mixing a busy social life with charitable works. Dillon began keeping a diary in 1879, which she would continue to write until her death. Her ancestor, Mary Mathew, was also a diarist and kept the diary for the discipline of the daily activity. She soon began to write for the love of it, and some have surmised she wrote with the intention her diaries would be read by others. She attended lectures in Old English and literature at King's College, London from late 1882 to 1884, and began to learn Irish in 1893."]}]}}
