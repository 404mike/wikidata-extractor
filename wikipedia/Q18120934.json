Born in an Irish Catholic family in Cork, Mathew was educated at the largely Protestant Trinity College, Dublin, before joining the English bar. In 1881, although still a junior barrister, he was appointed to the High Court of Justice, where he sat in the Queen's Bench Division and was said to be the best nisi prius judge of his time. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1901, before resigned from the bench due to health reasons in 1905.\nMathew was a driving force behind the creation of Commercial List in 1895, the forerunner of the modern Commercial Court, and was the first judge in charge of the List.", "link_mentions": {}}}
