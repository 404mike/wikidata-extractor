He successfully defended many people accused of notorious murders and became known as \"The Great Defender\".\nMarshall Hall practised as a barrister in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, when the public took a great interest in the sensational court cases of the day. Big criminal and civil trials were widely reported on by the popular press on a daily basis. As a consequence, he and other successful barristers of the day became very famous. The widespread belief that he was a much better orator than lawyer may explain his failure to achieve elevation to the High Court Bench, which was a source of great disappointment to him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 24", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 Edward Marshall Hall, English lawyer and politician (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "September 16", "response": ["*1858 \u2013 Edward Marshall Hall, English lawyer and politician (d. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett", "response": ["Birkett became a popular defence counsel, something that on occasion caused him trouble; he was once forced to refuse a defendant's request to act as his representative because Birkett was expected in a different court.Hyde (1965) p. 77.

He strongly resisted all claims that Barrow had been poisoned, claiming instead that she had died by taking a medical preparation containing arsenic. Despite the advice given by his Counsel, Seddon insisted on giving evidence in his own defence;\"Murder in Mind\"  p. 1474 it was claimed that he turned the jury against himself through his arrogant and condescending attitude.

Despite a fierce battle from the defence team, the jury took just one hour to find him guilty. Margaret Seddon was acquitted of any involvement in the murder.

Hall then focused on the medical evidence, emphasising that Dr Cadman's opinion as to Munro's time of death deserved careful consideration, adding that Munro would undoubtedly have screamed when struck across the mouth, yet nobody had reported hearing her screams, or to hearing shingle shovelled over her body after her death. Referring to the prosecution contention that the motive for the murder was robbery and the testimony from Dorothy Ducker that his client had promised her he and Field would \"have more money\" by the late afternoon of 19 August, Hall contended Munro was not worth robbing, and no evidence existed of premeditation. Hall finished his closing argument by stating that if the jury could not accept the evidence put forward by the prosecution as conclusive, both Gray and Field were entitled to a verdict of not guilty.Famous Trials 2: Herbert Rowse Armstrong, Field and Gray, George Joseph Smith, Ronald True  p. 79"]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Marshall Hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Marshall Hall"]}, {"page": "Murder of Mabel Greenwood", "response": ["Harold Greenwood (1874 \u2013 17 January 1929) was an English solicitor who was accused and acquitted of murdering his wife by arsenic poisoning.
