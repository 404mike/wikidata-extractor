He successfully defended many people accused of notorious murders and became known as \"The Great Defender\".\nMarshall Hall practised as a barrister in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, when the public took a great interest in the sensational court cases of the day. Big criminal and civil trials were widely reported on by the popular press on a daily basis. As a consequence, he and other successful barristers of the day became very famous. The widespread belief that he was a much better orator than lawyer may explain his failure to achieve elevation to the High Court Bench, which was a source of great disappointment to him.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
