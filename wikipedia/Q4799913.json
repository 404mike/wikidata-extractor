Cricket websites do not indicate whether he was left or right-handed, and in his one first-class match, he did not bowl.\nIn 1921, he played non-first-class cricket for Durham in the Minor Counties, mostly as a middle-order batsman, but occasionally opening the innings. He scored 100 runs in eight innings, two of them not out, including his personal highest of 49 against Yorkshire Second Eleven.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Arthur Pape (1912) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "Pape (surname)", "response": ["* Arthur Pape (1890\u20131945), English cricketer"]}]}}
