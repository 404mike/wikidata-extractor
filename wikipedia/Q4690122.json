Rahman, but found it hard to communicate her ideas to him and the planned musical collaboration did not take place. Rahman did, however, provide M.I.A. with a number of contacts and allow her to use his studio, where 22 members of drumming group The Tapes were recorded for Kala. Producer Switch, who had initially travelled to India purely to engineer the planned sessions, ultimately became involved in the composition of several tracks for the album. A visit to Angola to work with DJ Znobia was cancelled after Znobia was involved in a car accident, but M.I.A. was able to record in Trinidad, Liberia, Jamaica and Australia. She and Switch relied heavily on Logic Pro, a digital audio workstation produced by Apple, and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment, using a microphone and a Macbook Pro. The album features guest vocals from Afrikan Boy, The Wilcannia Mob, and Timbaland, and further collaborations with Switch, Blaqstarr, Morganics and Diplo.

She had originally planned to include \"Mango Pickle Down River\"\u2014her remix of The Wilcannia Mob's song \"Down River\"\u2014on a mixtape, but chose to include it on the album because she felt it was rare to hear the \"aboriginal voice\" in recorded music, and described opening track \"Bamboo Banga\" as having a \"bamboo-stick beat, house-y feel\". The song \"Jimmy\" was included as a tribute to her mother and is M.I.A.'s version of an old Bollywood film track to which she used to dance at parties as a child. Despite the involvement of Baltimore club musician Blaqstarr, \"The Turn\" turned out to be the album's only ballad, and the track has been described as the least like club music. \"20 Dollar\" was written about the relative ease of buying AK-47s in war-torn Liberia. \"XR2\" recalls part of the artist's life growing up with rave music in early 1990s London, while the song \"Paper Planes\" jokingly plays on M.I.A.'s problems with visas and certain perceptions of immigrants.", "* Afrikan Boy \u2013 vocals "]}, {"page": "Paper Planes (M.I.A. song)", "response": ["Director Bernard Gourley, known for his work with hip hop artists, directed the music video for \"Paper Planes\".
