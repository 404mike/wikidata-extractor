He was a member of the 1950 FIFA World Cup squad, and scored five goals in nine international games. He was described as one of the best inside forwards of his generation.\nAt club level, he played for Tottenham Hotspur from 1946 to 1956, helping the club to win the Second Division title in 1949\u201350, and then the First Division title in 1950\u201351; \"Spurs\" also finished as First Division runners-up in 1951\u201352. He scored 69 goals for the club in 325 games. In January 1956 he signed for Port Vale for a \u00a37,000 fee, though was then sold on to Nottingham Forest for the same fee ten months later after he was criticized for being too much of 'an individualist'. He was a success at Forest, helping the club to win promotion to the top-flight in 1956\u201357. He moved on to Leyton Orient in 1958, before retiring in 1960.

Spurs finished in fourth place, six points behind champions Liverpool, and exited the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup at the opening stages. Greaves scored 35 goals in 41 league games to again finish as the division's top scorer.

Devonshire started playing for non-league Southall and in doing so came to the attention of league clubs such as Reading, Southampton, and Brentford. By day he worked as a fork-lift truck driver at the Hoover Factory in Perivale, Middlesex. During this time he was spotted playing for Southall by West Ham United scouts, Eddie Baily and Charlie Faulkner who recommended him to West Ham manager, Ron Greenwood.

He organised a more defensive line-up for the 1955\u201356 campaign, and spent a club-record \u00a37,000 for Tottenham Hotspur playmaker Eddie Baily.
