His best bowling and batting performances were both achieved in his first season, 1895. In his first game, against Cambridge University, he took three Cambridge wickets for 93 runs. Then a week later, in the match against Oxford University he made 33, batting at No 10.His brother Arthur played Minor Counties cricket for Durham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bucknell", "response": ["*John Bucknell (7 June 1872 \u2013 5 March 1925) was an English cricket player."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Bucknell (1895\u20131905) 10 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Jack Bucknell", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Bucknell"]}, {"page": "Bucknell, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Bucknell"]}]}}
