He was born at Bedminster, Bristol and died at Darlington, Co Durham.\nBucknell was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace or leg-break bowler. His first-class cricket career was spasmodic, with three matches in each of the 1895, 1899 and 1905 seasons and a single game in 1904. His best bowling and batting performances were both achieved in his first season, 1895. In his first game, against Cambridge University, he took three Cambridge wickets for 93 runs. Then a week later, in the match against Oxford University he made 33, batting at No 10.His brother Arthur played Minor Counties cricket for Durham.", "link_mentions": {}}}
