In the years since her last appearance, she has become more mature, principled and assertive. Effy eventually becomes a stock trader with some help of her friend, Dominic (Craig Roberts), who claims to be in love with her. After achieving success through illicit information provided to her by Dominic, she pursues a relationship with Jake (Kayvan Novak), her wealthy boss, and begins to live the high life. Unfortunately, this is short-lived when the Financial Services Authority receives a tip-off, and evidence, that her success was the result of insider trading, and Jake places the blame squarely with her (although he had actually encouraged her to do it). To make matters worse, her personal life is shattered when Naomi is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Effy finds herself having to deal with both the possibility of going to prison and the pain of losing Naomi. Eventually, after managing to get Emily back to London to ensure that Naomi's last days will be spent with her beloved girlfriend at her side, she agrees, after some sympathy from Victoria, Jake's ex-girlfriend and the FSA agent investigating Effy, to sign a confession that will name Jake and reduce her own prison sentence.

Turned at the age of 16, he is actually 46 years old when he first appears, although he maintains a teenage appearance and perspective. Following his turning, his parents provided him with blood in order to protect both him and their neighbours. Eventually both of Adam's parents aged and died, with his father spending his final days in the Barry hospital in which George and Nina work. Having caught Adam while he tried to feed from his father, George and Nina attempted to take him to Mitchell for training. Mitchell was reluctant to take on more responsibility as he himself was continuing to struggle with his own thirst. Instead, he arranged for Adam to stay with Richard and Emma, a seemingly middle-aged vampire couple who apparently had \"a system\" in place to enable them to live safely and not pose a threat to society. George and Nina returned to get him back when they realised that Richard and Emma were essentially perverts, their 'system' consisting of a BDSM-esque party where the humans allowed themselves to be drunk from. Despite the comfort that the vampires could offer him, Adam rejected the vampires' way of life, bluntly informing them that they were all perverts. Although George was willing to take on the responsibility, Adam recognised that he couldn't force them to cope with him like his parents had, deciding to make his own way in the world so that he could find out whether or not he would be dangerous on his own. After Mitchell advised him to find good people to share his life with so that they could keep him under control by 'inspiring' him with the disappointment they would feel, Adam decided to depart on the next train out of the city to see where it took him, demonstrating a marked improvement when he rejected a girl he had initially attempted to drain when she offered to go with him. In the spin-off Becoming Human, Adam formed his own small 'group' at his new school in the form of recently turned werewolf Christa and recently murdered ghost Matt, the three teaming up to investigate Matt's murder.

It flaunts some stylistic devices, such as titles and sections and self-aware narration, but it doesn't try too hard to be desperately clever. It's a self-confident work for the first-time director, Richard Ayoade, whose purpose I think is to capture that delicate moment in some adolescent lives when idealism and trust lead to tentative experiments.
