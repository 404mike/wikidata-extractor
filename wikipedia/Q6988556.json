The first syllable of his surname is pronounced \"Wise\", but Sir Humphrey and Bernard persistently call him \"Weasel\". Weisel does not appear after the first series, following his acceptance of a position on a quango (Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation) tasked with investigating the appointment of other quangos, the government's honours system, and \"jobs for the boys\".
