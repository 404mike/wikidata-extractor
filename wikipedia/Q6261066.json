Though Hague was a strong orator, a Gallup poll for The Daily Telegraph found that two-thirds of voters regarded him as \"a bit of a wally\", for headlines such as his claim that he drank 14 pints of beer in a single day in his youth. He was also criticised for attending the Notting Hill Carnival and for wearing a baseball cap in public in what were seen as poor attempts to appeal to younger voters. Shortly before the 2001 general election, Hague was much maligned for a speech in which he predicted that a re-elected Labour government would turn the UK into a \"foreign land\". The BBC also reported that the Conservative peer John Lord Taylor criticised Hague for not removing the whip from John Townend, a Conservative MP, after the latter made a speech in which he said the British were becoming \"a mongrel race\", although Hague did reject Townend's views."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Townend"]}, {"page": "Maastricht Rebels", "response": ["*John Townend (Bridlington)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Townend"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Townend"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Townend"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Townend"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Townend"]}, {"page": "Laurence Robertson", "response": ["Robertson courted controversy in May 2001 by ignoring James Cran's advice not to publicly express support for John Townend.
