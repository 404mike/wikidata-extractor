Other medical themes that have been discussed on the programme include dementia and diabetes mellitus. The Tuesday edition of the programme takes the form of a phone-in on a consumer matter and is referred to as Call You and Yours.

The focus of this edition was fair pay for women in the aftermath of the resignation by Carrie Gracie from her post as the BBC's China Editor and her claim that the BBC was guilty of pay discrimination. Robinson had publicly given support for Ms Gracie and was replaced due to \"impartiality issues\". Shari Vahl presented this edition of the programme instead.

BBC management itself was said to be \"deeply unimpressed\" with Humphrys comments. Because of the BBC's impartiality rules, Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey, a prominent advocate of equal pay at the BBC, was unable to conduct an interview with Gracie on the programme, while You and Yours presenter Winifred Robinson was briefly taken off-air for tweeting her support for Gracie. More than a fortnight later, it was reported Conservative Culture minister Tracey Crouch, and other female MPs, have refused to be interviewed by Humphrys in response to his comments about Gracie's resignation.
