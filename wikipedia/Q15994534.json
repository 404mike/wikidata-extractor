A monumental lion statue was erected at Qasr Ibrim in his honour. It bears an inscription in hieroglyphic Meroitic describing the king as \"beloved of Amun of Luxor\". Jack Plumley dated it to between 286 and 306. There are two Meroitic graffiti at Philae, on the north and south walls of the passage between Hadrian's Gate (where pilgrims arrived) and the hypostyle. The graffiti are proskynemata to the goddess Isis and were almost certainly carved when the king was there in person as a means of continuing his presence after he left. Below each is \"a relief of a king presenting the hieroglyph sekhet,\" a symbol of the sekhet fields and a traditional representation of the king handing over the Dodecaschoenus to Isis. The image, however, is an earlier Egyptian one \"usurped\" by Yesebokheamani."]}]}}
