He spent time on loan at Windsor & Eton and was twice named as Wimbledon's Young Player of the Year as the club progressed from the Isthmian League Premier Division to the Conference Premier with two successive promotions, including winning the Conference South title in 2008\u201309. He was signed by Championship club Coventry City for an undisclosed fee in January 2010, following a short loan spell. He missed the first half of the 2010\u201311 season with injury problems, which also brought his loan spell at Crewe Alexandra to a premature end. Despite ongoing injury issues he managed to make 31 appearances in the 2011\u201312 season and was allowed to leave the club by mutual consent in January 2013, at which point he rejoined AFC Wimbledon, who had by then won a place in the English Football League.\nHussey left Wimbledon and signed with Burton Albion in June 2013. He ended the 2013\u201314 season on loan at Bury, but returned to Burton to play at Wembley in their League Two play-off final defeat. He joined Bury on a free transfer in May 2014 and featured 42 times in the club's 2014\u201315 League Two promotion campaign. He made 50 appearances in the 2015\u201316 season and was sold on to League One rivals Sheffield United for an undisclosed fee in June 2016. He struggled for game time in the 2016\u201317 League One title winning season and was transfer-listed. He spent the 2017\u201318 season in League Two on loan at Swindon Town and joined Cheltenham Town on a free transfer in May 2018. He helped Cheltenham to reach the play-offs at the end of the 2019\u201320 season, though they were eliminated at the semi-final stage. The club went on to win promotion as League Two champions in 2020\u201321, with Hussey featuring 48 times. He was sold to Port Vale in January 2022.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hussey", "response": ["* Chris Hussey (born 1989), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Stephen O'Halloran", "response": ["However, O'Halloran later came under criticism when the team conceded two late goals in two matches against Swansea City and Leicester City.
