By the early 1600s the area had already developed a reputation as one where the traditional power of the aristocracy and the established church was weak,;  becoming a haven for incomers who did not fit in with established thinking elsewhere: religious non-conformists, scientific and literary free-thinkers, industrial entrepreneurs and political dissenters. The Midlands Enlightenment that followed in the 18th century saw the town's growth into an important centre of  literary, musical, theatrical and artistic activity, and the emergence of an unusually tolerant, secular society, characterised by \"unfussy conviviality ... lack of dogmatism ... and a  sponge-like ability to absorb new ideas\". This openness and cultural pluralism was further encouraged by the town's broad-based and entrepreneurial economic structure. The \"city of a thousand trades\" was made up of a wide variety of highly skilled specialists operating in small workshops, producing a constantly diversifying range of products in response to changing market conditions and collaborating in a shifting, fragmented web of overlapping and informal groupings. The result was the development of a culture that valued variety, adaptability and change more than uniformity and continuity; whose need for cooperation and trust bred an innate suspicion of boastfulness and pretension; and which was characterised by the remarkable capacity for \"accommodating difference\" that has been an enduring theme of the city's history. The historian William Hutton, noting the diversity of Birmingham's culture as early as 1782, remarked that \"the wonder consists in finding such agreement in such variety\". Over two centuries later in 2008 the philosopher Sadie Plant could still describe \"the city's unique, almost declass\u00e9 mixture of individualism and co-operation\"."]}, {"page": "Anti-art", "response": ["An expression of anti-art may or may not take traditional form or meet the criteria for being defined as a work of art according to conventional standards.Paul N.

Andrew Hussey claims in his biography of Debord that the term spectacle began life not in a Marxist context, but was first borrowed from Nietzsche and his concept of the mass secret. The critic Sadie Plant argues that later theories of postmodernism, particularly those of Baudrillard and Lyotard, owe much to Debord's theory, and represent an apolitical appropriation of its criticism of the unreality of life under late capitalism.

Out of Xenofeminism grew a strand of accelerationist thought labeled \"gender accelerationism,\" asserting that the destruction of the patriarchy and the gender binary is not just a preferred future, but an outright inevitability of capitalism's acceleration.

Recoding Gender: Women\u2019s Changing Participation in Computing, written in 2012 by Janet Abbate, examines the history of programming and how gender bias shifted the demographic of programmers. The main argument made by Janet Abbate in this book was that women are discriminated against in the technology field and are not given the same opportunities as men. This is a problem in the world today because everyone should be treated equally and not judged based on their gender. It is unfair for someone to be overlooked and not given the same opportunities to showcase their skills. A method used by Janet Abbate throughout this book was archival research. She used data from the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Commerce from the end of the twentieth century (Abbate, 2012, p.\u00a03). It makes sense that she would use this method because she was researching information from the late 1900s.
