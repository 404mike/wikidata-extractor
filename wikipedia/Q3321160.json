Notable examples of his design work include the ZX81 case and touch-sensitive keyboard and the ZX Spectrum's rubber keyboard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sinclair QL", "response": ["The electronics were primarily designed by David Karlin, who joined Sinclair Research in summer 1982. The industrial design was done by Rick Dickinson, who already designed the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum range of products. Sinclair had commissioned GST Computer Systems to produce the operating system for the machine, but switched to Domesdos, developed by Tony Tebby as an in-house alternative, before launch. GST's OS, designed by Tim Ward, was later made available as 68K/OS, in the form of an add-on ROM card."]}, {"page": "ZX Spectrum", "response": ["The Spectrum is based on a Zilog Z80, a CPU running at 3.5\u00a0MHz (or NEC D780C-1 clone). The original model has 16\u00a0KB (16\u00d71024 bytes) of ROM and either 16\u00a0KB or 48\u00a0KB of RAM. Hardware design was by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research, and the outward appearance was designed by Sinclair's industrial designer Rick Dickinson.", "Rick Dickinson came up with a number of designs for the \"ZX82\" project before the final ZX Spectrum design. A number of the keyboard legends changed during the design phase including ARC becoming CIRCLE, FORE becoming INK and BACK becoming PAPER. The Spectrum reused a number of design elements of the ZX81: The ROM code for things such as floating point calculations and expression parsing were very similar (with a few obsolete ZX81 routines left in the Spectrum ROM). The simple keyboard decoding and cassette interfaces were nearly identical (although the latter was now programmed to load/save at a higher speed). The central ULA integrated circuit was somewhat similar although it implemented the major enhancement over the ZX81: A (fully) hardware based television raster generator (with colour) that indirectly gave the new machine approximately four times as much processing power as the ZX81, simply due to the Z80 now being released from this video generation task. A bug in the ULA as originally designed meant that the keyboard did not always scan correctly, and was rectified by a \"dead cockroach\" (a small circuit board mounted upside down next to the CPU) for Issue 1 ZX Spectrums.", "The ZX Spectrum Next is an expanded and updated version of the ZX Spectrum computer implemented with FPGA technology funded by a Kickstarter campaign in April 2017, with the board-only computer delivered to backers later that year. The finished machine, including a case designed by Rick Dickinson who died during the development of the project, was released to backers in February 2020. MagPi called it \"a lovely piece of kit\", noting that it is \"well-designed and well-built: authentic to the original, and with technology that nods to the past while remaining functional and relevant in the modern age\". PC Pro magazine called the Next \"undeniably impressive\" while noting that the printed manual lacked an index, and that some features are \"not quite ready\". A further Kickstarter for an improved revision of the hardware was funded in August 2020."]}, {"page": "ZX81", "response": ["The ZX81 was designed to be small, simple, and above all, inexpensive, with as few components as possible. Video output is to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data are loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes. It uses only four silicon chips and a mere 1\u00a0KB of memory. There is no power switch or any moving parts with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present in some models. It has a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard. The ZX81's limitations prompted a market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought designer Rick Dickinson a Design Council award.", "The ZX80's design introduced many key features that were carried over to the ZX81; as Sinclair himself later said, \"the ZX80 was very much a stepping stone to the ZX81\".Scot (Aug/Sept 1981) The design was driven entirely by the desired price \u2013 the machine had to cost less than \u00a3100 but still make a healthy profit. Its distinctive wedge-shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch-sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair. As he later recalled of Sinclair's approach, \"Everything was cost driven. The design was the face of the machine.\"BBC News (23 April 2007) The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair's cost-cutting. It made use of a sheet of plastic, on which the keys were printed, overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed. This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter-style keyboard, though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and \"feel\".", "The task of designing the ZX81's case again fell to Rick Dickinson, who produced an updated version of the ZX80's wedge-shaped case. This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher-quality case. Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as \"an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width\", though this approach was eventually dropped.Dickinson (24 August 2007) From start to finish, the design process took about six months.Cooke (August 1982)", "left|thumb|One of Rick Dickinson's original concept drawings for the ZX81, envisaging the machine as part of \"an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach\".|alt=Sketch of two concept designs for the ZX81, showing the computer with a series of similarly shaped boxes stacked behind it in a row."]}, {"page": "Cambridge Z88", "response": ["* Rick Dickinson's \"Pandora to Z88\" gallery on Flickr"]}, {"page": "Northumbria University", "response": ["* Rick Dickinson, designer of the ZX81 computer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Yorkshire", "response": ["|Rick Dickinson"]}, {"page": "Sandwich degree", "response": ["Alumni of the Newcastle Polytechnic Bachelor of Arts degree in \"Design for Industry\" include Rick Dickinson of Sinclair and Jony Ive of Apple."]}]}}
