The term supposedly refers to nine streams originating from Safed Koh. However, according to S. H. Hodivala, the name of the province derives from the Sanskrit term Nagarahara, which appears in a 9th-century inscription discovered at Ghosrawa in present-day Bihar, India. Nang-go-lo-ho, the Chinese transcription of Nagarahara, appears in the annals of the Song dynasty of China.

H. Holdich, The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 29, No. 1/2 (1899), pp. 2-9 (retrieved 4 May 2007). Bellew concluded that Pashtun tribal names could be traced to Greek and Rajput names, from which he theorised the widespread intermixing of ancient Greek  tribes with the ancient tribes of northern India, from the time of the Maurya Empire. For example, Bellew states that Sarabaur (or Sarban) the reputed ancestor of the \"Afghans\" (i.e. Pashtuns), was a corruption of the word Suryabans or Suryavansh, \"the Solar dynasty\", one of the main lineages from which Rajputs claim descent. He sees many parallels between Pashtun group names and Yaduvanshi Rajput clans: The sub-tribes of the Utmanzais, such as the \"Baddo\" with theYaddo (or Yadu, one of the tribes of the Rigveda); between the \"Gadun Pastoons\" and the Jadaun Rajputs; the Pashtun Bettani with the ancient elite Rajput Bhatti clan. He further claims that Pashtuns have so many points in common with the Rajput customs \"as to raise the suspicion of a real connection\"."]}, {"page": "John Biddulph", "response": ["Biddulph was born in 1840, and was the third son of Robert Biddulph.

Henry Walter Bellew argues that the location of his death was here at Daulat Beg Oldi. The news of Sultan's death led to a bloody succession which saw the ascension of Abdurashid Khan. Abdurashid Khan recalled the forces in Tibet and exiled Haidar. By then, Haidar had some successes against the Changpa Tibetans of Baryang, but his forces suffered greatly from the altitude and elements. By the time the army returned to Yarkand, of the starting few thousands, less than a dozen were left. The exiled Haidar received the refuge from his maternal aunt in Badakhshan.

On page 8 of this seminal work, Bellew refers to the Baraki's origins as \"mysterious\" but not of Arab/Ansari descent. On page 62, he writes of the Baraki: \"After the time of the Greek dominion, the Baraki increased greatly in numbers and influence, and acquired extensive possessions towards the Hindu Kush in the north and the Suleman range in the south, and eastward as far as the Indus. During the reign of Mahmud Ghaznavi (2 November 971 \u2013 30 April 1030), the Baraki were an important tribe, and largely aided the Sultan in his military expeditions. The reputation then acquired as soldiers they still retain, and the Afghan monarchs always entertain a bodyguard composed exclusively of Baraki. . . . In Afghanistan though their true origin is not suspected, the Baraki are a distinct people. The Baraki pretend descent from the Arab invaders, but this is a conceit of their conversion to Islam. They are a fine, tall and active people, with fairer complexions than the generality of Pashtuns, and are held in consideration as a respectable people. They have no place in the Pashtun genealogies by that name, being generally reckoned along with the Tajik population.
