He succeeded his father to the barony in 1795 but, as this was an Irish peerage, it did not entitle him to a seat in the British House of Lords. The following year he was instead elected to the House of Commons for Saltash, a seat he held until 1802.\nLord Macdonald died in June 1824, aged 50. He never married and was succeeded in his titles by his younger brother, Godfrey Macdonald, 3rd Baron Macdonald of Sleat.", "link_mentions": {}}}
