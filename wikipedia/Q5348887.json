He moved to Bangor in 1953 to join the newly founded Marine Biology Station as a lecturer with Denis Crisp, and completed his PhD in 1957. He had a wife, Marian, and two children, Rhiannon and Aled.He retired early in 1986, but went on to lecture in Kuwait, returning to do part-time lecturing at the University of Wales, Bangor. He died in a car accident at Gaerwen, aged 79.He wrote A key to the Genera of the British Seaweeds (1962).  It was most valuable as an update to Newton's Handbook of 1931 had become out-of-date and this was required to identify the genera of algae to be found on the shores of the British Isles.\nHe joined the British Phycological Society [1] in 1955 and served as a Member of Council (1959 and 1974\u20131977), as Assistant Secretary (1959) and Hon. Treasurer (1964\u20131968).  At the Eighth International Seaweed Symposium, held in Bangor in 1974, he was a member of the organizing committee and secretary.  He was President of the North Wales Wildlife Trust and Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory.", "link_mentions": {}}}
