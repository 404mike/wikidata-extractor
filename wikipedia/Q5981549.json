He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm bowler, initially a medium-pacer and later a spinner.\nFolley started his career as a seamer in 1982, playing for Lancashire. He switched to spin bowling after coaching and encouragement from Jack Bond. Over the next two seasons, he averaged less than thirty with the ball, taking 129 wickets, and in one match, had match figures of 12/57. Lined up for an England team spot, he suffered an injury to his left arm, and quit the game, after tours to Jamaica and Zimbabwe.\nIn 1991 he was given a second chance, playing for Derbyshire, but his first-team performances did not live up to his earlier performances.\nTwo years later, playing for Whitehaven, Folley was hit underneath the eye in a freak accident while batting in a match against Workington, and was taken to local hospital for a minor operation to repair his perforated eyeball There, while under anaesthesia, he suffered a heart attack and died. The hospital later admitted negligence. He was thirty years old.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Graeme Fowler", "response": ["He is the only batsman to score two complete hundreds in a match with the aid of a runner. Playing for Lancashire at Southport in 1982, he strained his thigh while fielding on the first day during Warwickshire's innings of 523\u20134 declared, but batted without a runner to score 26 not out at stumps.  He then scored exactly 100 before lunch on the second day with David Lloyd as his runner. In the second innings, Ian Folley ran for him (and acknowledged the crowd's applause for the century) when Fowler scored 128 not out on the third day. In 1987, Fowler scored an unbeaten century in a Sunday League match against Somerset, despite an injury which forced him to bat with a runner.1987 Lancashire v Somerset - Old Trafford , Matt Proctor, Old Trafford Cricket Ground, Manchester].
