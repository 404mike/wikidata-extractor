On 15 July, Court was credited with the destruction of a second Eindekker. Five days later, Court was again teamed with Richardson, and at 1830 hours, they destroyed an Eindekker and drove a second one down out of control, for two victories apiece. Richardson having been wounded during this sortie, Court was assigned to a newly arrived pilot, Corporal Thomas Mottershead for familiarization flights and initial combat missions. On 5 August, Court and Second Lieutenant W. H. Rilett, while crewing FE.2b Serial No. 6932, were shot down, crash landing just behind the British lines and then having the wrecked plane shelled by German artillery. Just over a month later, on 9 September, Court was teamed with Noel Webb, when they drove a German two-seater out of control, making Court an ace. He was subsequently promoted to Sergeant. On 27 September, Court flew with Second Lieutenant Victor William Harrison; in that day's dogfight, they shot down, and were shot down by, a German two-seater crew of Albert Dossenbach and Hans Schilling. All survived. Court went on to two final wins while flying as observer for fellow ace James Leith Leith; one the destruction of a German fighter plane on 22 October, the other a Fokker fighter driven down out of control on 9 November.Franks, et al, p. 83.
