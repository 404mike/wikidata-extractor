Their only purchase was greeted with suspicion by the Dart: the 19-year-old Adam Fraser \"is said to be a most capable half-back. Whether he is worth all the trouble the club have gone through to secure him remains to be seen, but if he is anything like a 'class' player it is strange that he has never been heard of before.\" It was reported that the Cambridge University and England full back Lewis Vaughan Lodge had agreed to play for the club, but he did appear until February. Meanwhile, after a casual start, Small Heath came back from a three-goal deficit to beat Leyton 8\u20133 in a friendly. Winning ways continued in the League as they beat Nottingham Forest with a goal in the first five minutes, scored by Hands from a Hallam centre. Roach's performance in goal suggested he was the best of the four tried thus far, and Frank Lester made a promising debut at back, but both teams' forwards were disappointing.", "After a lively friendly against Aston Villa produced a 2\u20131 win for Small Heath, they returned to losing ways at Bolton Wanderers.

Small Heath put out a strong side against Blackburn Rovers\u00a0\u2013 the Leicester Chronicle believed that \"at no period of the season have they had such a representative team\". While Corinthian back Lewis Vaughan Lodge's long-expected first appearance for the club\u00a0\u2013 which proved to be his last\u00a0\u2013 was marred by a lack of discipline positionally, Haddon enhanced his reputation at centre-forward and contributed to Wheldon's fine winning goal after debutant Bill Robertson had scored from a penalty kick. The Rovers forwards played an effective dribbling game, but Small Heath's once-characteristic \"dash\" earned them victory and took them into March off the bottom of the table."]}, {"page": "Charles Lodge Adamson", "response": ["His father, also called Charles, played minor counties cricket for Durham, as well as first-class cricket for Queensland, who he played for once while on the 1899 British Lions rugby union tour to Australia.
