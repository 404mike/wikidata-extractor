One of these was an early version of \"Rockin' for Myself\". He thought it sounded much more commercial than the other and when the demand for underground techno began to fall off, he recorded a new version of the track, which would become a massive hit in clubs. Warner Records signed him and a new remix was released, reaching the Top 20 in the UK. From then, Rodway stuck with the name Motiv 8. He told in an interview, that because of the song's success, Jarvis Cocker of Pulp approaced him, asking for a remix of \"Common People\". The following success of that remix played a big part in establishing the name Motiv 8, according to Rodway.", "Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"If rave/NRG is your dance flavor of choice, \"Rockin' For Myself' by Motiv8 is a must menu addition. Angie Brown, last heard fronting singles by Bizarre Inc., puts forth a respectable performance, while Steve Rodway crafts an instrumental picture that strobes with vibrant keyboard colors and racing beats.
