He took five wickets in an innings on ten occasions during the season, including twice in a match against Middlesex, to claim ten wickets in the match. Playing a match for Liverpool and District against the touring Australians, he took his best bowling figures in an innings that season, claiming seven wickets for 72.

His final match of the season was a further fixture against the Australians, in which he took eight wickets in the match for the North. In all, Crossland took 112 first-class wickets at an average of 10.06 in 1882, topping the national bowling averages.

He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. \"C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!\" Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University at the end of the season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue\u2014the awarding of the Cambridge \"colours\" to sportsmen\u2014by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets.

His first match in the summer of 1882 was played for the university against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), a match which Cambridge won by 189 runs, aided by the strong bowling of Ramsay, who claimed 13 wickets and conceded 49 runs, the tenth best bowling performance for the university. Later in the summer he claimed eight wickets against Lancashire, and then picked up 12 wickets against the touring Australians. In the match against the Australians, he collected five wickets in the first innings and seven in the second, albeit more expensively than in the match against the MCC. He was less prolific against Lancashire for Somerset, during a match played in such cold weather that catches were hard to hold. Bill Roe said that during this match, Lancashire's number eleven, George Nash was dropped off every ball of an over bowled by Ramsay, before Roe himself caught Nash off the first ball of the following over. Ramsay was selected to play for the \"Gentlemen of England\" against the touring Australians, and claimed three wickets in a match which the Australians won by an innings.

The Western Daily Press noted that Somerset were not able to field a full-strength team in the match, missing Evans, Ramsay and Roe. However, the Lancashire team which faced them was described by the same paper as being \"very second-rate\". The weather was showery most of the day, and play was abandoned at half five because of the rain, with Lancashire on 231 for 8 having won the toss and batted first. Heavy rain overnight made the ground unplayable on the second day, so play resumed the following day, although rain continued to threaten. The original wicket was badly damaged, being described in the York Herald as \"a puddle\", and so the stumps were moved to enable play to begin. Somerset took the final two Lancashire wickets in the first ten minutes, bowling them out for 237. Fowler and Sainsbury opened the batting for Somerset, and put on eighteen runs together before being dismissed in quick succession. The Western Daily Press recorded that \"after this disaster waited on the visitors.\" Only two other batsmen scored any runs for Somerset, and they were all out for 29 runs, the second lowest first-class total at the time. Somerset followed-on, and their second innings proceeded in much the same fashion as the first; the pair scored 35 runs, while the rest of the team only added a further 6. Somerset lost the match by an innings and 157 runs. The Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette defended Somerset's performance on the third day slightly, noting that the poor condition of the pitch favoured the Lancashire bowlers. Lancashire's George Nash took eight wickets in the first innings, including four in one four-ball over, while fellow spin bowler Jack Crossland collected six in the second innings."]}, {"page": "1896 Minor Counties Championship", "response": ["The leading run-scorer, Harry Foster, who played for Worcestershire, was the only batsman to score more than one century over the course of the season.
