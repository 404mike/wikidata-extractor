He rowed at Eton and Oxford, winning the Silver Sculls at Oxford. He graduated from the RCS in 1935 with a first class degree and then worked briefly as an assistant master at Eton (1935\u201336).\nMorrison-Scott was appointed as an Assistant Keeper (2nd class) in Department of Zoology at the British Museum (Natural History) on 1 October 1936. During World War II, he was a member of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and commanded a flotilla of tank landing craft during D-Day in Normandy, earning the Distinguished Service Cross (DCS). He was promoted to Assistant Keeper (1st class) in 1943. He became the Head of the Mammal Section in 1945 and Principal Scientific Officer in 1948. From 1956\u20131960, he was Director of the Science Museum. Then from 1960 he was Director of the British Museum (Natural History) until his retirement on 30 November 1968.He was Honorary Treasurer of the Zoological Society of London (1950\u201376). He was a Trustee of the Imperial War Museum (1956\u201360), He was a governor of the Imperial College of Science and Technology (1956\u201372) and was elected a Fellow in 1963. He was a Council member of the National Trust (1968\u201383) and a member of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries (1973\u201376).\nHe was a Fellow of the Museums Association and was knighted for his services.\nTerence Morrison-Scott married Rita Layton in 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Science Museum, London", "response": ["* Sir Terence Morrison-Scott DSc FMA (1956\u20131960)"]}, {"page": "Pallas's cat", "response": ["In 1951, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott considered"]}, {"page": "Scimitar oryx", "response": ["The scimitar oryx is a member of the genus Oryx and the family Bovidae. The German naturalist Lorenz Oken first described it in 1816, naming it Oryx algazel. The nomenclature has undergone various changes since then, with the introduction of names like Oryx tao, O. leucoryx, O. damma, O. dammah, O. bezoarticus and O. ensicornis. In 1826, Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar used the name Oryx ammah for the species. A year later, the name Oryx leucoryx came into use, but as this was a synonym of the Arabian oryx (then called Oryx beatrix), it was abandoned, and Oryx algazel was accepted once more. Over 100 years later in 1951, Sir John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott found that the name Oryx algazel was also ineligible for use. Finally, in January 1956, the International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature accepted Oryx dammah as the scientific name. There have been no more changes since then, though many papers published after 1956 created confusion by using names like O. gazella tao."]}, {"page": "Barbary lion", "response": ["*In 1951, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott recognized only two lion subspecies in the Palearctic realm, namely the African lion Panthera leo leo and the Asiatic lion P. l. persica."]}, {"page": "Panthera leo leo", "response": ["*Three decades later, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott recognized only two lion subspecies in the Palearctic realm, namely the African (P. l. leo) and Asiatic lions (P. l. persica)."]}, {"page": "Saudi gazelle", "response": ["Gazella gazella saudiya was the scientific name proposed by Douglas Carruthers and Ernst Schwarz in 1939.

In 1951, Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott assigned O. g. brookei as a subspecies of the Turkestan red pika (Ochotona rutila), but it is now treated as a subspecies of Glover's pika. Pen et al., in 1962, described the Muli pika (Ochotona muliensis) as a new form of the Glover's pika, but it is now considered an independent species based on skull morphology.  The Glover's pika was earlier treated as a subspecies of the Turkestan red pika, but it is now considered as an independent species based on the skull morphology, pelage color, and zoogeography. It had also been treated as a subspecies of the Chinese red pika (Ochotona erythrotis) partly because of its assignment under the Turkestan red pika. According to morphological and molecular studies,\u00a0the Glover's pika\u00a0is closely related to the Chinese red pika and the two are sister groups. In 1948, Argyropulo described the species Ochotona kamensis, and explained it to be the larger and more differentiated than the Chinese red pika and the Glover's pika. In 1985, after observing striking similarities between their skull structures and coat colors, Feng and Zheng synonymized Ochotona kamensis with Ochotona gloveri. In 1988, however, Erbajeva synonymized Ochotona kamensis with Ochotona gloveri brookei, and retained the name kamensis, as she did not use the principle of priority which recognizes the first valid application of a name to a plant or animal."]}, {"page": "Red rock hare", "response": ["In the 1950s, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott classified Poelagus as a subgenus of Pronolagus.
