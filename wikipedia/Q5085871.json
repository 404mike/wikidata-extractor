She made significant contributions to plant palaeontology and coal classification, and was the first female academic on the faculty of the University of Manchester. With her second husband, Humphrey Verdon Roe, Stopes founded the first birth control clinic in Britain. Stopes edited the newsletter Birth Control News, which gave explicit practical advice. Her sex manual Married Love (1918) was controversial and influential, and brought the subject of birth control into wide public discourse. Stopes publicly opposed abortion, arguing that the prevention of conception was all that was needed, though her actions in private were at odds with her public pronouncements.", "Stopes was born in Edinburgh. Her father, Henry Stopes, was a brewer, engineer, architect and palaeontologist from Colchester. Her mother was Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, a Shakespearean scholar and women's rights campaigner from Edinburgh. At six weeks old, her parents took Stopes from Scotland; the family stayed briefly in Colchester then moved to London, where in 1880 her father bought 28 Cintra Park in Upper Norwood. Both of her parents were members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where they had met. At an early age, she was exposed to science and was taken to meetings where she met the famous scholars of the day. At first, she was home-schooled, but from 1892 to 1894 she attended St George's School for Girls in Edinburgh. Stopes was later sent to the North London Collegiate School, where she was a close friend of Olga Fr\u00f6be-Kapteyn."]}, {"page": "1888 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Carmichael Stopes \u2013 The Bacon/Shakespeare Question"]}, {"page": "1840 in literature", "response": ["*February 5 \u2013 Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, Scottish writer and women's rights activist (died 1929)"]}, {"page": "Upper Norwood", "response": ["* Charlotte Carmichael Stopes (1840\u20131929), suffragette and Shakespearean scholar, organized cultural groups in Upper Norwood in the 1880s."]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["* Charlotte Carmichael Stopes (1840\u20131929) \u2013 scholar, author, and campaigner for women's rights"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy", "response": ["The WEU committee held an annual conference and over 150 public meetings between 1892 and 1896.
