Notice of his award appeared in the London Gazette of 26 June 1947.  [1]\nThe 19-year-old was driving a 3-ton truck full of cleared ammunition and explosives into the magazine area when it caught fire.  Knowing it could explode at any moment, he tried to remove the burning camouflage netting and, when that failed, tackled the developing blaze with fire extinguishers.  Despite his efforts the lorry exploded and Hughes died two days later of his wounds.\nA plaque containing a replica of his medal and summary of his action hangs in the St. Francis Centre in the Gorbals in Glasgow, where Hughes was born.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe Hughes", "response": ["Joe Hughes may refer to:", "*Joe Hughes (baseball) (1880\u20131951), baseball player for the Chicago Cubs", "*Joe Hughes (footballer) (1898\u2013?), Welsh professional footballer", "*Joe Hughes (British Army soldier) (died 1946), British recipient of the George Cross", "*Joe Hughes (boxer) (born 1990), British boxer"]}, {"page": "Joseph Hughes (GC)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Hughes (British Army soldier)"]}, {"page": "Joe Hughes (GC)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Hughes (British Army soldier)"]}]}}
