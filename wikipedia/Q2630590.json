As Dave Jones sat in the stand for his last game of the two-game touchline ban, Sheffield Wednesday started by far the strongest team and had two really good chances within just the first five minutes; Jermaine Johnson just nicked the ball off one of the opposition defender's but his shot was well saved by Matt Gilks, then another mistake lead to Giles Coke striking a fierce shot from 25-yards which forced an even better save out of Matt Gilks. Thomas Ince went close at the other end of the pitch with a long-distance shot, and then a mistake \u2013 this time by Wednesday \u2013 led by another in quick succession due to the poor pitch condition, saw Ince through one-on-one, but Chris Kirkland pulled out a good save to turn the ball behind for a corner. Into the second half and a corner by Blackpool saw one of their players have the best opportunity of the game when he hit the bar, this then led to a cross and a goal-mouth scramble which was eventually cleared away by the Owls. Apart from this the second half only entertained some half-chances, but both keepers had to ensure they were on their guard. The final whistle blew and it was seen as good point for Sheffield Wednesday as it was an extra point towards safety. The last three o'clock kick-off of the season for Sheffield Wednesday was when the Owls faced Ipswich Town at Hillsborough Stadium, with points for either team being vital in securing Championship safety. It was Ipswich who had the first chance of the game when a corner was whipped in and headed down at the far post to see Danny Pugh fortunately being able to clear off the line. It was not too long into the game when the first goal did come, and it was poor defending by Sheffield Wednesday when a long throw-in was not headed clear by Miguel Llera, and Jay Tabb easily tapped the ball into the net. Soon after the goal Chris Kirkland made a great save from a volley outside the box. Wednesday's luck soon got worse though as a tactical substitution saw Kieran Lee replaced by Steve Howard, seeing Wednesday's main goal threat, Jermaine Johnson, go out on the wing. Just three minutes later Jermaine Johnson pulled his hamstring and another sub had to be made, and if Jermaine Johnson had injured himself before the tactical substitution, then Steve Howard would most likely have just replaced him, however instead two subs had been made within half-an-hour, and another injury was added to the list, unfortunately it was Sheffield Wednesday's main goal threat. The Owls did have a great opportunity when Steve Howard had a free header sail over the bar from a corner. Before half-time though a goal-mouth scramble saw a Leroy Lita volley saved and then Anthony Gardner's shot cleared off the line by an opposing defender. Ipswich went close with a shot just a few minutes into the second half, but Sheffield Wednesday continued to make chances of their own, such as when Miguel Llera had a great effort in the area well saved by the opposing goalkeeper. Finally the well deserved equaliser did come, and it was good link up play between Chris Maguire and Lewis Buxton down wing that produced a cross that managed to make its way to the back post where Leroy Lita scored an unstoppable shot into the bottom corner. Miguel Llera then soon had a free-header which he somehow failed to put into the back of the net and then when J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan's pace on the wing produced a cross, Leroy Lita headed home to send Hillsborough wild. However, scenes soon died down as the goal was disallowed for offside. The last main piece of action of the game came from another long-throw from Ipswich, which Kirkland failed to punch clear, it was flicked on with the ball heading towards the empty net but luckily Danny Pugh was there yet again to clear off the line. It left the Owls four-points from safety, like several other teams, with just two games to go."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["|1||GK||align=left| Matt Gilks                                         ||2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["On 11 June Belgian Jos\u00e9 Riga was appointed as Blackpool's new manager.
