This challenge, in part, prompted the University Proctor, William Farish, to introduce the practice of assigning specific marks to individual questions in University tests and, in so doing, replaced the practice of 'judgement' at Cambridge with 'marking'. Marking subsequently emerged as the predominant method to determine rank order in meritocratic systems.Pollitt, A. (2012). Comparative judgement for assessment. International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 22(2), 157\u2013170. In 1760 he became a fellow of Trinity and in 1762 received his MA degree.

This is known as the Farish effect, a phenomenon noted by 18th-century chemist William Farish.

Each component, individually, stimulates the vallate papillae."]}, {"page": "Peter Jeffrey Booker", "response": [":\"... there are copious illustrations from the works not only of these early pioneers, but throughout the entire book and including computer-drawn 'drafting feasibility studies' based on what we call today 'computational geometry' but actually derived from the analytical geometry of the great French geometrician Gaspard Monge born in 1746 near Dijon, and to whose work a whole chapter is devoted. Another pioneer and contemporary of Monge, the Englishman the Rev William Farish has a chapter to himself which describes his investigations and development of isometric drawing.\""]}, {"page": "Thomas Bigge", "response": ["Bigge joined the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1795, and played a significant role there.
