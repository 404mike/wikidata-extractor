The aim was to create a \"Garden City\" to be modelled on the ideas of Ebenezer Howard's Garden City Movement. It was their intention to build a self-contained community with smallholdings, public buildings, open spaces, recreation grounds, woodland and a railway station, as well as developing sites for churches, hotels and factories. On Saturday 1 May 1920, ten weeks after the formation of the Society, the foundations of the first two houses were laid and by March 1922 ninety-one houses had been built. Unfortunately due to a lack of funding the scheme never reached full completion, with about 600 houses actually being built. Original drawings however showed that there were further plans to develop the farmland at Manor Farm, north of the A3. By the mid-1970s, one third of the properties were still owned by Onslow Village Ltd. Then, in 1984, the company was wound up and many shareholders and tenants had the chance to buy their homes at affordable prices.history section of Onslow Village website "]}, {"page": "Paymaster General", "response": ["*Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow 1928\u20131929"]}, {"page": "Zoological Society of London", "response": ["*Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow (1936\u20131942)"]}]}}
