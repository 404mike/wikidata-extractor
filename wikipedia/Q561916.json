Scott wrote a series of letters to the Edinburgh Weekly Journal under the pseudonym \"Malachi Malagrowther\" for retaining the right of Scottish banks to issue their own banknotes. This provoked such a response that the Government was forced to relent and allow the Scottish banks to continue printing pound notes.
