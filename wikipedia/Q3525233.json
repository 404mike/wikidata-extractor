He studied at the Scots College, (Paris), of which he became vice-principal. He was the author of two learned works, Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of the Northern Parts of Britain (1729), and Civil and Ecclesiastical History of Scotland, 80 to 818 (published 1853).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Glasgow", "response": ["The university has been without its original Bull since the mid-sixteenth century. In 1560, during the political unrest accompanying the Scottish Reformation, the then chancellor, Archbishop James Beaton, a supporter of the Marian cause, fled to France. He took with him, for safe-keeping, many of the archives and valuables of the Cathedral and the university, including the Mace and the Bull. Although the Mace was sent back in 1590, the archives were not. Principal Dr. James Fall told the Parliamentary Commissioners of Visitation on 28 August 1690, that he had seen the Bull at the Scots College in Paris, together with the many charters granted to the university by the monarchs of Scotland from James II to Mary, Queen of Scots. The university enquired of these documents in 1738 but was informed by Thomas Innes and the superiors of the Scots College that the original records of the foundation of the university were not to be found. If they had not been lost by this time, they certainly went astray during the French Revolution when the Scots College was under threat. Its records and valuables were moved for safe-keeping out of the city of Paris. The Bull remains the authority by which the university awards degrees."]}, {"page": "John of Fordun", "response": ["Collectively, this work, divided into five books, is known as the Chronica Gentis Scotorum. The first three are unverified historically, which therefore casts doubt on their accuracy.  Yet they also form the groundwork on which Boece and George Buchanan afterwards based some of their historical writings. Thomas Innes argued that some of the history these men presented was doubtful in his Critical Essay (i, pp.\u00a0201\u20132,4), but Innes himself had his own political agenda and his work has also been criticized by modern historians. Fordun's claim of an unbroken line of royal descent from Fergus I in 330 BC can be seen as a contribution to a Scottish national origin myth constructed to counter the legend of Brutus of Troy, which English monarchs deployed to claim sovereignty over the whole of Britain.Donaldson, William (1980), Inside the Kist of Glendulochan: Some Thoughts on Political Fiction, in Cencrastus No. 4, Winter 1980-81, pp. 20 - 22,  The 4th and 5th books contain much valuable information, and become more authentic the nearer they approach the author's own time.

After the later scholarly work of Thomas Innes, this list was given little credence in its initial parts. It was, however, the culmination of centuries of development of king-lists for the Kingdom of Scotland. Much fictional material had been introduced into these lists by the humanist Hector Boece, writing half a century before Buchanan. Peter Hume Brown in his biography of Buchanan describes him as somewhat more sceptical than Boece in what he accepted as historical; but less so than John Mair, writing earlier. Buchanan has been called inconsistent in his treatment of classical sources since his rejection of the legend of Gathelus does not extend to the early Scottish kings, who are equally unsupported by classical authors."]}, {"page": "Thomas Innes", "response": ["Thomas Innes may refer to:", "*Thomas Innes (historian) (1662\u20131744), Scottish Roman Catholic priest and historian", "*Thomas Innes of Learney (1893\u20131971), Lord Lyon"]}, {"page": "James Stanier Clarke", "response": ["In 1816, Clarke published a Life of King James II, from the Stuart MSS. in Carlton House (2 vols.).
