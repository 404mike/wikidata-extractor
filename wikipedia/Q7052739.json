The MCC agreed to do so, so long as the county was able to secure home and away fixtures with eight over first-class opponents in 1921. By the middle of 1920 he had secured sufficient fixtures for Glamorgan for the following season, which secured their entry into the 1921 County Championship. He played in Glamorgan's debut first-class appearance against Sussex at Cardiff Arms Park, which Glamorgan won by 23 runs. He was vice-captain in 1921, but secured the captaincy once more for the 1922 season, successing Norman Riches, he continued in this role for the 1923 season. His form dropped away in 1923, with his 380 runs that season coming at an average of 14.61. This led to him retiring from the first-class game at the end of that season, having made 46 first-class appearances for Glamorgan.
