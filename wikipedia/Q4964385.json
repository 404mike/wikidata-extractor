He was born in Horwich, Lancashire.\nKrikken played a large number of games for Lancashire's Second XI between 1965 and 1968, but the county persisted with Keith Goodwin as first-team keeper and Krikken appeared for them only twice at first-class level, making little impression on either occasion: against Oxford University in 1966 he took three catches and scored 4 and 0, while against Scotland the following year he took two catches but did not bat in either innings.\nIn 1969 Krikken moved to Worcestershire, but again was unable to dislodge the first-choice keeper (in this case Rodney Cass) and was selected only once, against Cambridge University, taking two catches and being dismissed for 4 in his only innings. Even at Second XI level his batting was poor: he never reached 30 in more than 40 innings.\nHe is the father of Karl Krikken, who had a long career with Derbyshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Karl Krikken", "response": ["Krikken was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, the son of Brian Krikken, a wicket-keeper with Lancashire and Worcestershire between 1966 and 1969. Krikken joined Derbyshire in the 1987 season and was the club's first-choice wicket-keeper for most of his career after displacing Bernie Maher in the side. He was also a lower-order right-handed batsman."]}, {"page": "Gordon Wilcock", "response": ["Wilcock was signed by Worcestershire in 1968, having been spotted playing club cricket for Ilkley Cricket Club. He made one Second XI appearance for the county that season, and many more in 1969, but Brian Krikken prevented his standing as keeper until the end of the year. Wilcock also played for Dudley Cricket Club during this period, and continued in the seconds in 1970."]}, {"page": "Krikken, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Krikken"]}]}}
