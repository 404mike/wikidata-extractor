Although the majority of his service was against the French during the Napoleonic Wars, he is best remembered for the action of 25 October 1812, an engagement against a larger American frigate during the War of 1812 in which his ship HMS Macedonian was captured. Carden was criticised for the loss of his ship, specifically his handling of the vessel during the action. Following his defeat in October 1812 he never served again in an active capacity, but he remained in the Navy and continued to gradually rise though the ranks in retirement, eventually becoming a full admiral before his death in 1858.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ballycastle, County Antrim", "response": ["* John Surman Carden (1771-1858) - officer of the British Royal Navy, died in Ballycastle"]}, {"page": "USS United States vs HMS Macedonian", "response": ["The capture of HMS Macedonian  was a naval action fought near Madeira on 25 October 1812 between the heavy frigate , commanded by Stephen Decatur, and the frigate , under the command of John Surman Carden.

At 23:00, Carden was detached to look for Collingwood and inform him of the location and direction of the French while Mundy continued to follow the enemy squadron. Although Hydra was now isolated and hopelessly outnumbered, Lamellerie made no effort to attack the British ship: he even failed to respond when the brig Furet, falling behind the larger and faster frigates, came within range of Hydra.James, p. 214 Mundy opened fire at 04:30, Lieutenant Dumay on Furet acknowledging that he was hopelessly outgunned and completely unsupported by immediately striking his colours.Clowes, p. 198  As Collingwood's squadron was nowhere within sight and the French were rapidly pulling ahead, Mundy abandoned the chase, secured his prize and turned back eastwards as the French continued into the Atlantic. It is not known why Lamellerie fled from such an inferior force and allowed one of his ships to be captured without opposition: modern historian Richard Woodman describes his conduct as \"astonishing, given the weakness of the opposition and [the strength of his] own combined force\", but in a separate work suggests that Lamellerie's orders precluded any engagement until his force was safely off the coast.Woodman, p. 219"]}, {"page": "John Surnam Carden", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Surman Carden"]}, {"page": "John Carden", "response": ["*John Surman Carden (1771\u20131858), British Royal Navy officer"]}, {"page": "Surman", "response": ["*John Surman Carden (1771\u20131858), officer of the British Royal Navy in the early nineteenth century"]}, {"page": "Carden (surname)", "response": ["*John Surman Carden (1771\u20131858), British Royal Navy officer"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Navy admirals (1707\u2013current)", "response": ["| John Surman Carden"]}]}}
