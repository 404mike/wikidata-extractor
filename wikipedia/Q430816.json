ELSPA along with other concerned groups believed that the BBFC lacked the clarity needed for video game ratings; current CEO Mike Rawlinson also said that the BBFC ratings were developed for linear content, while PEGI's were better reflective of interactive content such as video games. In 2008, ELSPA started a large push to getting PEGI as the approved system, while in the interim petitioning the BBFC to color-code its ratings labels to approach the same color-coding used by PEGI. The UK Parliament passed the Digital Economy Act 2010 into law, and required by July 2012 to transfer the rating of video games from BBFC to the VSC (outside of games that contain strong pornographic content) and officially adapting the PEGI rating system, along with legal enforcement of selling mature titles to minors.
