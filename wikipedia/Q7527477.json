He served five successive terms as mayor on its first achieving municipal borough status, from 1867 onwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Furness Railway", "response": ["In 1881 revenue for the second half of the year was about \u00a3300,000 and the dividend 7% a year; second-half revenue declined to \u00a3216,000 in 1885 (with the dividend being cut to 2%), but recovered to \u00a3275,000 in 1889 allowing a dividend of 5% a year. In 1892 there was no dividend for the first year-half (because of a prolonged strike in the Durham coalfield) this triggered a renewal of previous complaints from shareholders that the company had sunk between two and three million pounds into docks at Barrow, but refused to give any indication of the profitability (or otherwise) of the docks. The additional complaint was now made that most of the directors were ornamental and deferred to Sir James Ramsden who had held managerial posts with the company since 1846, and had been the managing director since 1866. For the second half of 1892, despite the disruption to traffic and loss of an engine caused by subsidence at Lindal, a dividend at the rate of 3% a year was declared; amendments seeking to force the resignation of Sir James were moved, but defeated.", "In May 1895, Sir James Ramsden, by now 73, resigned due to ill health. He was not replaced as managing director. A new general manager (Alfred Aslett) was recruited from the Cambrian Railways, where he had 'worked wonders ... from being one of the most sluggish it has become one of the most enterprising lines in the kingdom' The incumbent 'secretary and general manager' became 'secretary' only  (his assistant, Ramsden's son, became 'superintendent of the line') before retiring in 1897 after thirty-three years in the post; the locomotive superintendent retired at the same time after forty-six years with the company.", "The first locomotive superintendent, recruited from Bury, Curtis and Kennedy in 1846, was later to be knighted as Sir James Ramsden, a leading civic figure and first Mayor of Barrow. No locomotives were actually built in the local works itself: they were generally standard designs, purchased from other manufacturers.  By 1921, fifteen different works were represented. However, W. F. Pettigrew, who had taken over operations in 1896, was to introduce some measure of standardisation."]}, {"page": "Seascale", "response": ["The community of Seascale continued as a series of farms until the coming of the Furness Railway in 1850. This ran from Whitehaven to Barrow in Furness.  Some small development took place in the wake of this, but it was recorded that in 1869 \"there was not a shop in the place\".Gissing and the Lake District, Frank J Woodman, 1980. The Gissing Society Newsletter Vol XVI Further development had to wait until 1879 when Sir James Ramsden of the Furness Railway promoted an ambitious plan to develop Seascale as a holiday resort. Edward Kemp of Birkenhead produced the designs, which included a large hotel, marine walks and villas, which would have stretched along  of the coastline, however only a small number of buildings were constructed. The Scawfell Hotel, dating from that time and adjacent to the railway station, was demolished in 1997.The buildings of England \u2013 Cumbria. Matthew Hyde and Nikolaus Pevsner, 2010.

Seascale was also promoted as an ideal centre for touring the western valleys of the Lake District.

Below diagonally intercepting the arms is a band containing a bee and arrow to reflect the town's name (B-arrow). The stag and serpent either side are taken from the crests of the Duke of Devonshire and the Duke of Buccleuch respectively, who were the principal landowners at the time of Barrow's early growth. The ram's head a top of the arms symbolises Sir James Ramsden, Barrow's first mayor and a major figure in the development of the town. The Latin script below reads 'Semper Sursum', which is the town's motto meaning 'ever onwards'."]}]}}
