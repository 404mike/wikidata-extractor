In the early 1870s she emerged as a pioneering female aesthete in a mostly male community of artists and writers. By the late 1880s she had become prominent among New Woman writers such as Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), Amy Levy, Mona Caird, Olive Schreiner, Rosamund Marriott Watson, and Katharine Tynan. She was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne, William Michael Rossetti, Amy Levy, Edith Nesbit, Arthur Symons and Arnold Bennett. Her much-discussed poem The Ascent of Man presents a distinctly feminist response to the Darwinian theory of evolution.", "Blind's only novel, \"Tarantella\", a prose romance, is a remarkable work in many ways, but was neither a commercial nor a popular success. Richard Garnett wrote that \"the fate of this remarkable book is one of the injustices of literature\". Noting that \"it has an exciting story, interesting characters, ease and naturalness of dialogue\", and \"is the receptacle of much of the writer's most serious thought and intense personal feeling\", Garnett attributes the novel's failure to attract a wide audience to the preference for realism and the \"minute analysis of character\" in the mid-1880s. Tarantella, by contrast, \"is very romantic, very idealistic, very eloquent, and not in the least concerned with minutiae\". Garnett concludes that \"now that the taste for romance has revived\", Blind's novel \"ought to have another chance of taking its rightful place\". While the novel was translated into French in 1893, and reprinted in a single-volume format the same year by T.

This enabled her to study the great artists of the Renaissance, and the influence of Quattrocento artists like Botticelli is especially visible in her works from this point onwards. After this period, De Morgan's art began to move away from the more traditional, classical subjects and style favoured by the Slade school towards a development of her own particular, mature style.

The architectural writer Michael Hall was also impressed, describing Bodley's drawing room as \"Edwardian antiquarian taste at its most refined\". The process of reconstruction was less harmonious, Williams and Garner rowed constantly and Garner ultimately resigned. Almost all of Bodley and Garner's work was eradicated in the \"brutal\" remodelling undertaken by William Randolph Hearst. Williams also assembled a collection of arms and armour which was housed at the castle, and made major improvements to the castle's setting, moving the village which previously stood close to the castle's walls to a new location outside of the gates and constructing three entrance lodges. In 1903, the novelist Violet Paget, writing under her pseudonym Vernon Lee, used the castle as the model for St Salvat's Castle in her Gothic novel Penelope Brandling: A Tale of the Welsh Coast in the Eighteenth Century. Godfrey Williams, Morgan's son, disliked St Donat's, by tradition on account of its being haunted although this is disputed, and in 1921, having first culled the herd of deer that his father had reintroduced to the park, put the castle up for sale. Its advertisement in The Times, dated 3 May 1921, described the castle as \"a comfortable and liveable old-world home of the first importance\".
