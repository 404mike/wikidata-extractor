Throughout these months, the young author revised Paul Morel, the first draft of what became Sons and Lovers. In addition, a teaching colleague, Helen Corke, gave him access to her intimate diaries about an unhappy love affair, which formed the basis of The Trespasser, his second novel. In November 1911, Lawrence came down with a pneumonia again; once recovered, he abandoned teaching in order to become a full-time writer. In February 1912, he broke off an engagement to Louie Burrows, an old friend from his days in Nottingham and Eastwood."]}, {"page": "1975 Whitbread Awards", "response": ["*Helen Corke, In Our Infancy"]}, {"page": "The Trespasser (novel)", "response": ["The Trespasser is a 1912 novel by D.
