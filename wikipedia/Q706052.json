Anunoby emigrated to the US as a child, playing youth basketball in Missouri and college basketball for Indiana. Whilst Admiral Schofield, who played that season with the Washington Wizards, was born in London, he has never held British nationality; he was born to a U.S. Navy family, and returned to the U.S. with his family in early childhood. Another British player, Tarik Philip, was added to the Washington Wizards roster at the end of the 2018\u201319 season. The most recent NBA player to have been developed in the British basketball system, South Sudanese refugee and naturalised British citizen Luol Deng retired at the end of the 2018\u201319 season. At the time of his retirement, Deng career on-court earnings of $151 million, making him the highest earner of any British player in history, and one of the highest paid British athletes. Other British basketball players who have played in the NBA include Chris Harris, James Donaldson, Steve Bucknall, John Amaechi, Michael Olowokandi, Ndudi Ebi, Ben Gordon, Kelenna Azubuike, Pops Mensah-Bonsu, and Joel Freeland.", "A 2018 piece on the web outlet of US sports media giant ESPN explored why British basketball has so far failed to develop players to the degree of countries such as France, Germany and Australia. The first is the dominance of other sports, especially football, in the country's sporting culture. A 2016 survey by Sport England found that basketball was the third most-played sport among the 14\u201325 age group in England, just behind rugby union in numbers\u2014but both sports combined have less than one-third the participation of football. Additionally, a British sport journalist pointed out that football academies are \"really bad at letting players out of the system who aren't going to make it\", frequently keeping players until age 17 or 18, beyond an age at which they can reasonably be developed for top-level basketball. Another issue is politically related. Basketball is not played in the elite fee-paying secondary schools that produce a disproportionate share of the UK's political leaders. Also, several British basketball insiders have cited problems with the sport's governance within the UK, with Kevin Routledge, chairman of the BBL's Leicester Riders, calling it \"shambolic\", and former NBA player John Amaechi saying \"British basketball is dominated by people who are well meaning but poorly skilled\". Funding is another issue. The British government provided many sports, including basketball, with major funding in advance of the 2012 Olympics. However, Team GB was perceived as a failure in basketball, with the women's team going winless and the men going 1\u20134, though losing by only 1 point to eventual silver medallists Spain. As a result, basketball's funding was dramatically cut. The sport also currently lacks private funding, with Amaechi claiming that many British BBL players are not paid living wages. Finally, until very recent years, British players were reluctant to develop themselves in the more competitive leagues of continental Europe."]}, {"page": "Outside the Lines", "response": ["The program has also featured exclusive interviews with newsmakers such as: President George W.
