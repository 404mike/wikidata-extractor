The Chronicle offers no further information.\nFrithugyth, like her predecessor as Queen of Wessex, \u00c6thelburg, wife of Ine of Wessex, is recorded in surviving charters, not merely witnessing her husband's donations of land to the church, but also making donations in her own right. Although the reliability of many of these charters is questionable, historian Barbara Yorke notes that \"Queen Frithugyth would be an unlikely choice as donor in a completely fictitious\" charter.\nThe principal donation attributed to Frithugyth is a sizable estate at Taunton, given to Winchester Cathedral. This was expanded by later Kings of Wessex and England, including \u00c6thelwulf, \u00c6thelstan, and Eadred, who refer to Frithugyth's earlier donation.\nNo descendants of \u00c6thelheard and Frithugyth are known.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "740", "response": ["* Frithugyth, queen of Wessex "]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelheard of Wessex", "response": ["\u00c6thelheard's wife Frithugyth is recorded in the Chronicle as making a pilgrimage to Rome in 737."]}, {"page": "Frithuwold of Chertsey", "response": ["The possible Frith family may also have included the eighth-century figures Saint Frithuswith,  and Frithugyth, wife of King \u00c6thelheard of Wessex.Blair, \"Frithuwold's kingdom\", pp. 106\u2013107; Yorke, p. 110.
