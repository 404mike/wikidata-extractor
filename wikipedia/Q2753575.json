Preserving Sissinghurst was \"an act of intense filial duty\". He had first raised the possibility of giving the house and garden to the National Trust in 1954, but Sackville-West was adamantly opposed. After her death in 1962, which saw the castle pass to him although Benedict was the elder son, he began lengthy negotiations to bring about the handover. The Trust was cautious: it felt that an endowment beyond the Nicolsons' means would be required, and it was also unsure that the garden was of sufficient importance to warrant acceptance. Sir George Taylor, Chairman of the National Trust's Gardens Committee doubted it was \"one of the great gardens of England\", and had to be persuaded of its merits by Sackville-West's close friend and one-time lover, the gardener Alvilde Lees-Milne. Discussions continued until, in April 1967, the castle, garden, and Sissinghurst Farm were finally accepted."]}, {"page": "Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh", "response": ["*George Taylor, director"]}, {"page": "George Heriot's School", "response": ["* Sir George Taylor (botanist) (1904 - 1993) "]}, {"page": "George Taylor", "response": ["George Taylor may refer to:", "*George Taylor (Alamo defender) (c. 1816\u20131836), soldier in Texas army, died in the Battle of the Alamo", "*George Taylor (British Army officer) (1905\u20131994), served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Mau Mau campaign", "*George Taylor (Medal of Honor) (1830\u20131893), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*George Taylor (Canadian politician) (1840\u20131919), Canadian House of Commons member", "*George Taylor (Pennsylvania politician) (c. 1716\u20131781), signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence", "*George Taylor (New York Representative) (1820\u20131894), American Congressman from New York", "*George Taylor (Connecticut politician) (1802\u20131881), politician and physician", "*George Taylor (Australian politician) (1861\u20131935), Australian labour leader and member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia", "*George Taylor (Australian rules footballer) (1876\u20131953), Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne", "*George Taylor (manager) (1853\u20131911), American baseball manager", "*George Taylor (cricketer) (1909\u20131986), English cricket player", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131982), played in the Football League for Brentford and Millwall", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u2013?), English football outside right, who played for Coventry City F.C. in the 1930s", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u2013?), English football left half", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20131982), Scottish footballer, played for Aberdeen and Plymouth Argyle", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1920) (1920\u20131983), English football goalkeeper, played for West Ham United", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1948), Scottish footballer, played for Grimsby Town", "*George Taylor (Negro leagues) (1869\u2013?), Negro leagues first baseman", "*George Taylor (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s, 1910s and 1920s", "*George Taylor (DC Comics), fictional character in the DC Comics universe, chief editor of the Daily Star", "*George Taylor (artist) (1914\u20131996), English commercial artist", "*Sir George Taylor (botanist) (1904\u20131993), British botanist, from 1956 to 1971 director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew", "*George Taylor (gardener) (1803\u20131891), introduced celery to the United States", "*George Taylor (priest) (died 1811), Anglican priest", "*Taylor (Planet of the Apes), Colonel George Taylor, fictional hero of the first two films of the original Planet of the Apes series played by Charlton Heston"]}, {"page": "Meconopsis villosa", "response": ["Meconopsis villosa, the Himalayan woodland-poppy, is an ornamental poppy, which is native of Nepal.

In their description of Paeonia lutea var. ludlowii, these authors indicate that it is distinctly different from variety lutea. Recent analysis shows that these differences between ludlowii and the other described taxa in the P. delavayi-group are consistent whilst the character states within the other taxa occur in any combination. Therefore Hong concludes that ludlowii should be acknowledged as a distinct species, while the other taxa cannot be upheld and should be synonymized with P. delavayi."]}, {"page": "James Macdonald (ornithologist)", "response": ["In 1962 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
