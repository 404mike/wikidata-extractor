Bailey lived in London until 1972 when he moved to Dartmouth in Devon.\nIn the mid to late 1970s he moved back to London and for a time he was the Course Organiser of the Musical Instrument Repair Course (set up by Selwyn Jones, Paul Harvey and John Stone) at Merton College in Wimbledon. The demands of academic management however did not suit him and he was happiest when in the classroom passing on his skills to students. Hence in the late 70's he moved back to Dartmouth and he continued to make instruments there into the 1990s.\nJohn was originally a woodwork teacher at a school in Hendon and made instruments in his spare time.  His business card from the early seventies said \"Albert John Bailey \u2013 Violin Maker\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John (given name)", "response": ["*John Bailey (MP) (died 1436), MP for Cricklade and Calne", "*John Bailey (Australian politician) (born 1954), former Australian politician", "*John Bailey (Massachusetts politician) (1786\u20131835), Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts", "*John Bailey (Irish politician) (1945\u20132019), member of Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council", "*John Bailey (Victorian politician) (1826\u20131871), Australian politician", "*John Bailey (luthier) (1931\u20132011), maker of fine guitars in England", "*John Bailey (producer), Canadian recording engineer, producer", "*John Bailey (footballer, born 1950), English footballer and chairman", "*John Bailey (footballer, born 1957), English footballer", "*John Bailey (footballer, born 1969), English footballer", "*John Bailey (rugby league) (born 1954), Australian rugby league footballer and coach", "*John Bailey (English cricketer) (born 1940), English cricketer", "*John Bailey (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1941), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "Appalachian dulcimer", "response": ["Cheap imports from Romania, Pakistan and China are slowly making inroads into the American market.mountain dulcimer builders  at everythingdulcimer.com, retrieved October 30, 2011.
