She was the third of Frederick William Beechey's five children. In 1858, she married a Hudson's Bay Company official, Edward Hopkins, whose work took him to North America. Hopkins travelled alongside with him. While sailing, she was able to sketch extensively, therefore, capturing a now lost way of living \u2013 the last days of the fur trade.Hopkins painted actively during the 1860s and '70s. Her best-known works are several large paintings made from her sketches. She portrayed a voyageur's life in the mid-nineteenth century. Hopkins, however, remained relatively unknown until recently. At the same time, considering that, she was an artist placed in a context where gender-imposed restrictions were prevalent. In fact, Frances Anne Hopkins was dubbed as a woman who \"staked out an identity based on difference: a woman in a group of men.\" Her works were featured at exhibitions of the Art Association of Montreal, followed by, eleven exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London.The Hopkins family returned to England in 1870 where she lived until her death. Hopkins was an artist able to record an important aspect of Canadian history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people on the postage stamps of Canada", "response": ["* Frances Anne Hopkins (1988)"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian artists", "response": ["* Frances Anne Hopkins (1838\u20131919), painter"]}, {"page": "Kaministiquia River", "response": ["The river has been depicted by many prominent Canadian artists such as William Armstrong (1822\u20131914), Frances Anne Hopkins (The Red River Expedition at Kakabeka Falls, 1877) and Lucius Richard O'Brien (Kakabeka Falls, 1882)."]}, {"page": "The Song of Hiawatha", "response": ["thumb|Minnehaha Feeding Birds, Frances Anne Hopkins, ca. 1880", "Early paintings were by artists who concentrated on authentic American Native subjects.
