During his election campaign Shipwright's election address pledged him to a strong Navy, and a foreign policy which aimed at securing an honourable peace with a just settlement of reparations and war debts. In domestic policy he sought economy without decreasing safety and efficiency.

Shipwright won the election with 11,566 votes and a majority of 2,687 over Mansel.
