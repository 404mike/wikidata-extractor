Inge was a right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper.  He was born at Holmwood, Surrey.\nInge made his debut in county cricket for Oxfordshire against Cambridgeshire in the 1928 Minor Counties Championship.  Three seasons later in 1930 while attending the University of Oxford, he made his first-class debut for Oxford University against Glamorgan at the University Parks, in what was his only first-class appearance for the university.  In that same season he was selected to play for a combined Minor Counties team, making two first-class appearances against Wales at Penrhyn Avenue, Rhos-on-Sea, and Lancashire at Old Trafford.  These two appearances bought him limited success, with 19 runs and behind the stumps a single catch and three stumpings.  He continued to play Minor counties cricket for Oxfordshire prior to World War II, making 68 appearances.  After the war he made a further 94 Minor Counties Championship appearances for Oxfordshire, playing his final match against Berkshire in 1955.He died at Rugby, Warwickshire, on 18 March 1991.
