Henley was recruited by Robert Fitzroy Bell, the major backer of the Observer, and brought in young writers including Rudyard Kipling. The political line was that of Charles Whibley, assistant editor, a diehard Tory. Bell became discouraged by 1894, and sold out. Henley was succeeded by James Edmund Vincent, with Percival Parr as editor.Parr had played in the 1880 FA Cup Final."]}, {"page": "Clopton Lloyd-Jones", "response": ["He returned to the Oval on 10 April, when as the inside-forward or winger he scored the only goal when Clapham Rovers won the Cup Final against Oxford University to deserve fully his description in the Football Annual for that year as 'A very neat dribbler and dangerous shot at goal; was invaluable in the Cup Ties.' In the first half, he attempted to score twice, with a shot from the left which glanced off a goalpost, and a centre kick downfield which was saved by the Oxford goalkeeper Percival Parr. In the second half, six minutes before the close of time, the deadlock was broken when his teammate Francis Sparks conducted the ball to within \"about six yards of the University goal\". Although Oxford's Charles King attempted to stop the ball with a weak mis-kick, Lloyd-Jones, \"who had followed well up shot it between the posts. This feat quite 'brought down the house.'\" According to The Field magazine's report, there was \"vociferous cheering, throwing up of hats, and other demonstrations of delight from their supporters.\"  At the game's end, Lloyd-Jones, and his team captain Robert Ogilvie, were specially cheered by the crowd. At 21 years and 150 days Lloyd-Jones was the 'baby' of his team and the youngest Cup Final scorer in the event's then history.He superseded Charles Clerke (Old Etonians), who was 21 years 173 days at the 1879 Cup Final, and then superseded in turn by Teddy Wynyard (Old Carthusians), who was aged 20 years 8 days at the 1881 Cup Final."]}, {"page": "Percivall Parr", "response": ["#REDIRECT Percival Parr"]}]}}
