The club made a poor start to the 1978-79 season, failing to win their first six league encounters. Despite this however, they recorded victories against Juventus and PSV Eindhoven in the European Cup, with Cooper failing to be selected for the ties by Greig. A mixed season domestically followed and they had all but lost the title in a 4\u20132 away defeat to Celtic on 21 May 1979. Describing losing the championship, Cooper said \"you just want to emigrate as soon as you have got changed and walked out of the ground. It is like a spectre which haunts you for weeks.\" Despite this, Rangers won the 1979 Scottish League Cup Final in a 2\u20131 victory against Aberdeen and were victorious in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final, winning 3\u20132 over Hibernian. Tensions were beginning to rise between Cooper and Greig, mainly due to less-frequent selection of Cooper by the new manager. Cooper would often return home to Hamilton complaining the club he loved was \"kicking him in the teeth\". That season, Cooper made 49 appearances and scored ten goals. On 4 August 1979, Cooper scored a memorable solo goal against Celtic in the 1979 Drybrough Cup Final at Hampden. A crossed ball in from Alex MacDonald met Cooper at the edge of the box, where he went on to \"keepie up\" the ball over Roddie MacDonald, Murdo MacLeod, Tom McAdam and Alan Sneddon before slotting the ball past onrushing Celtic goalkeeper Peter Latchford. The goal was voted the greatest ever Rangers goal by Rangers fans and listed by The Guardian's Rob Smyth as the second greatest ever solo goal, after Diego Maradona's Goal of the Century. Sandy Jardine, who had scored a spectacular second goal for Rangers during the match, admitted his goal had been overshadowed by Cooper's. \"I scored one of my best goals that day,\" said Jardine, \"and it hardly got a mention.\""]}, {"page": "Macdonald", "response": ["* Roddie MacDonald (born 1954), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Clan Macdonald of Clanranald", "response": ["* Roddie MacDonald (born 1954), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1978 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||5||Roddie MacDonald"]}, {"page": "1976 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||5||Roddie MacDonald"]}, {"page": "1975 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||5||Roddie MacDonald"]}, {"page": "1974 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||14||Roddie MacDonald "]}, {"page": "1980 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["The match represented a last chance of success in the 1979\u201380 season for the traditionally dominant Old Firm, as Aberdeen had won the Scottish league championship.
