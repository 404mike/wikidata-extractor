This simple perpendicular church was constructed during the 13th century, with early 16th century additions. Its plan comprises a chancel with an organ chamber to the north and a three bay nave with tie beam roof. The church was restored in 1868. Wickhambreaux was one of the early minsters founded in Kent before 700. The Art Nouveau stained glass east window of the Annunciation dates from 1896. The donor was \u201cCount\u201d James Francis Gallatin and this was the first commission in Europe given to American glassworkers. The window is dedicated to Gallatin's mother Mrs Harriette Duer de Gallatin, who had been married to Albert Gallatin Jr.  It was designed by Arild Rosenkrantz and manufactured in John La Farge's New York Studio. James Francis Gallatin was the great grandson of Albert Gallatin the longest serving United States Secretary of the Treasury and member of Thomas Jefferson's cabinet. James Francis Gallatin edited the pro-ported diary of his grandfather James Gallatin who had acted as private secretary to Albert Gallatin at the conclusion of the War of 1812.  Published in 1914 as 'A Great Peace Maker: The Diary of James Gallatin'.  This has subsequently been assessed to be a fraud committed by James Francis Gallatin.  In an article in The American Historical Review (LXII July 1957 pp 878\u2013885) Raymond Walters Jr. stated '. . . I reached the conclusion that the diary is a complete fraud.' James Francis styled himself Count Gallatin, though his right to the title was disputed, but he was known to his own family as 'bad Jimmy'. Walters notes that no manuscript for the diary has survived or was ever known to have been seen by anybody other than Jimmy. J. R. Ackerley in his posthumously published autobiography speculated that his father had a homosexual relationship with \"Count\" James Francis de Gallatin James Francis Gallatin was declared bankrupt 14 times in-between 1879 and 1889, and died in 1915 with \u00a3128 to his name."]}, {"page": "1972 in poetry", "response": ["* J.
