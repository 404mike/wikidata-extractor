Once again, within 25 minutes they had blown Ballymena away and were 3\u20130 up again with goals from Mark McAllister, Peter McMahon and Michael Gault, and sealed their place in the final by winning 3\u20131 that was met with wild celebrations from the large Portadown support and the players and management. With the Kop Stand at Windsor Park collapsing, the final was forced to be moved to The Oval, where they would take on Glentoran. In the league, Portadown played Glenavon at Mourneview Park with the winner being guaranteed third place and a lucrative UEFA Europa League qualifying round spot. Glenavon raced into a two-goal lead before James Singleton was sent off for clashing with Ken Oman. Portadown had levelled it 2\u20132 through Peter McMahon and Gary Twigg goals, before Eoin Bradley was hauled down by Ross Redman and a last-minute penalty was dispatched by Andy McGory. Portadown were strong favourites going into the final, but the final failed to live up to expectations, with virtually nothing happening in the first half. In the second half, David Scullion scored to give The Glens the lead after a controversial refereeing decision had denied Portadown a penalty just before what proved to be the only goal."]}, {"page": "Alan McDonald (Northern Ireland footballer)", "response": ["In June 2007 he became manager of Glentoran in his native Belfast, where he stayed for three seasons, guiding the club to the IFA Premiership title in 2008\u201309. He also coached his country's under-21 side. After McDonald was appointed manager of Glentoran, he started to bring in new faces. He signed Dungannon Swifts winger David Scullion along with Rory Hamill. McDonald also brought in young promising players, including Daryl Fordyce, Philip Carson, Matty Burrows, and Shane McCabe. He also added goalkeeper Michael Dougherty as backup to Elliott Morris, and brought in Hearts defender Johnny Taylor. In his first full season as manager of the East Belfast club, McDonald led Glentoran to win the County Antrim Shield over Crusaders. In McDonald's second season, he led the club to become Irish Premiership champions after four years. During his second season McDonald continued to bring in new faces, after selling Michael Dougherty, McDonald brought in Dundela keeper James Taylor. In his third season in charge McDonald started by signing former Northern Ireland international Keith Gillespie and Newry City player Richard Clarke. But Glentoran went on a losing streak, and after a 6\u20130 home defeat to Coleraine, fans turned against McDonald and calling for him to resign. McDonald stayed on until his side lost 2\u20130 to Dungannon Swifts F.C. and McDonald resigned after the game."]}, {"page": "2006 Setanta Sports Cup", "response": ["*  David Scullion (Dungannon Swifts)"]}, {"page": "Scullion, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Scullion"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Australian State League players", "response": ["* David Scullion"]}]}}
