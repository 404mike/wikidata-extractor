In 1999, an assessment of the first 1,000 veterans involved in the Ministry of Defence's Gulf War medical assessment programme found \"no evidence\" of a single illness, physical or mental, that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group.: \"As the veterans assessed by the programme were all self selected, the prevalence of illness in Gulf war veterans cannot be determined from this study. Furthermore, it is not known whether the veterans in this study were representative of sick veterans as a group.\"To recapitulate using : \"[T]hough Gulf War veterans' illnesses are real and sometimes disabling, they do not seem to constitute a unique illness.\" Nevertheless, in 1999, MEDACT petitioned for the WHO to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and Iraqi civilians. A major 2006 review of peer-reviewed literature by a US Institute of Medicine committee concluded that, \"[b]ecause the symptoms vary greatly among individuals\", they do not point to a syndrome unique to Gulf War veterans, though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre-deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible.. The quote is of Lynn Goldman, who chaired the IOM committee that carried out the review. notes that \"despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being\" among Gulf War veterans, \"exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group. Likewise, there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality\". Simon Wessely praised the IOM's review, and noted that, despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed, its other findings made it \"equally clear that service in the Gulf war did aversely affect health in some personnel\".. The quote is of Wessely himself. Aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans' postwar health, because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service, another major stumbling block with some studies, like the thousand-veteran one, is that the subjects are self-selected, rather than a random sample, making general conclusions impossible.; ."]}, {"page": "List of mass hysteria cases", "response": ["* Ketereh, Malaysia (2019) \u2014 In August 2019, the BBC reported that schoolgirls at the Ketereh national secondary school (SMK Ketereh) in Kelantan, started screaming, with some claiming to have seen 'a face of pure evil'.
