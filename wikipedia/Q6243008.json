Riklis had already funded the 1982 film Butterfly as a vehicle for his wife Pia Zadora, and he wanted The Lonely Lady to serve the same purpose. Riklis reportedly supplied approximately half of the film's $6\u20137 million budget, along with completion costs, but refused any mention in credits. Robert R. Weston, responsible for the previous Robbins adaptation The Betsy, was the producer. Butterfly director Matt Cimber would write the script, before being replaced by Ellen Shepard and the duo John Kershaw and Shawn Randall."]}]}}
