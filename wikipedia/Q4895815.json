Blackburn Rovers were reluctant to part company with him, but the financial inducements offered by Southampton persuaded him to try his luck in the south. Described as \"strongly built\", Blackburn \"never gave less than 100%, but at time his play was too impetuous to be reliable\". He made his \"Saints\"  debut at right-back in the opening match of the 1900\u201301 season, a 4\u20133 victory at Luton Town and played in nine of the first ten games of the season until a serious ankle injury put him out of the side, with Bertram Sharp taking over.

He made his first-team debut when he took the place of Bertram Sharp at left-half for the game against Reading on 13 October 1900. He retained his place for the next match and made one further appearance in February, as Southampton went on to claim the Southern League title for the fourth time in five years."]}, {"page": "1900\u201301 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["The new recruits included three players from Everton, full-backs George Molyneux and Bertram Sharp and centre-forward Wilf Toman as well as former Everton and England forward Edgar Chadwick, who would renew his partnership with Alf Milward which had been described as \"the best in the league\" during their time together at Everton. From local football, the club recruited two players who were to play a major role in the future of the club: Bert Lee would have two long periods with the club as a player before becoming a trainer from 1914 to 1935. Fred Harrison would remain at The Dell for seven years and become the club's main goalscorer, with 88 goals from 166 appearances.", "| Bertram Sharp"]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["| Bertram Sharp"]}]}}
