Random Hold composed of David Rhodes, Bill MacCormick, David Ferguson, and Pete Phipps were described by a music journalist as \"disco orientated rock\", and by Nina Myskow in The Sun as a band to watch for as \"Their music shows talent, menace, originality and brains. A dynamic combination\". The band produced several singles in this period including \"Montgomery Clift\" and albums The View From Here (1980) and Burn the Buildings (1981).
