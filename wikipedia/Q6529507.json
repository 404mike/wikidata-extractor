After ten minutes, Alloa missed a goal scoring opportunity when Martin Cameron's shot went above the cross-bar after a pass from Gary Clark and three minutes later Mark Wilson's shot forced a save from Inverness goalkeeper Les Fridge. Alloa scored the first goal of the game in the 19th minute with a 12-yard shot from Gary Clark when Inverness failed to clear the ball from a corner kick. Shortly after, Alloa went close to doubling their lead when Fridge was forced to make another save. Alloa dominated the match for most of the first half-hour but Inverness equalised the score at 1\u20131 on 28 minutes when Alloa goalkeeper Mark Cairns deflected the ball into the path of striker Barry Wilson after making his first save of the game from a shot by Davide Xausa. Three minutes later, Alloa midfielder Mark Wilson ran clear down the right wing and shot the ball past goalkeeper Fridge to restore Alloa's lead to 2\u20131 before half-time.", "|GK || || Les Fridge"]}, {"page": "John McNaught (footballer, born 1964)", "response": ["His final competitive appearance for the club was at the outset of 1987\u201388, again at Old Trafford, where he is credited in some sources as the Chelsea goalscorer in a 3\u20131 reverse, though the statistic is mostly recorded as an own goal by the Red Devils' goalkeeper Gary Walsh. By October 1987, with no prospect of further appearances (which would have triggered an additional payment to Hamilton) he had walked out on the club and returned to Scotland. Despite being at Chelsea for little over a year, his spell coincided with those of a large number of other Scottish players at the club: Joe McLaughlin, Les Fridge, Billy Dodds, Kevin McAllister, John Millar, Eddie Cunnington, Gordon Durie, David Speedie, Steve Clarke, Doug Rougvie and Pat Nevin."]}]}}
