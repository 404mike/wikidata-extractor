Supported by Queen Victoria and Empress Maria Fedorovna she investigated a cure for leprosy. She set out on a round trip from Moscow to Siberia to find a cure, creating a leper treatment centre in Siberia. She returned to England and helped to found Bexhill Museum, but she was obliged to retire as a trustee. Marsden's finances came under scrutiny as did her motives for the journey. She was however elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. She has a large diamond named after her and is still celebrated in Siberia, where a large memorial statue was erected at Sosnovka village in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Museum", "response": ["In 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and hunter-gatherers, many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (much assembled by the British naval officer Maurice Portman), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator Hugh Nevill), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the Ainu of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist John Anderson), Siberia (with artefacts collected by the explorer Kate Marsden and Bassett Digby and is notable for its Sakha pieces, especially the ivory model of a summer festival at Yakutsk) and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the Sarawak collection put together by Dr Charles Hose, as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a gamelan musical set, was assembled by Sir Stamford Raffles."]}, {"page": "Leprosy", "response": ["* Kate Marsden"]}, {"page": "Bexhill-on-Sea", "response": ["* Kate Marsden FRGS (1859\u20131931), nurse who travelled through Siberia helping Yakut lepers, lived in Bexhill in the 1910s and became a founder of Bexhill Museum."]}, {"page": "List of nurses", "response": ["thumb|right|150px|Kate Marsden", "*Kate Marsden (1859-1931), British missionary nurse"]}, {"page": "LGBT History Month", "response": ["* 2018: Kate Marsden, Gilbert Baker, Claude McKay and Jan Morris"]}, {"page": "North-Eastern Federal University", "response": ["* A Kate Marsden scholarship is given to the best English language program student each year at the Institute of Foreign Languages and Regional Studies."]}, {"page": "The Girl's Own Paper", "response": ["The story paper provided a mix of stories and educational and improving articles, with 'Answers to Correspondents' and occasional coloured plates, poetry and music.
