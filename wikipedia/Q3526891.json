He made one Test appearance for England, in 1931. An all-rounder, Lee was a right-handed batsman and bowled both off break and slow-medium pace bowling with his right arm. He scored 1,000 runs in a season on thirteen occasions. Part of the County Championship winning sides in 1920 and 1921, Lee aggregated 20,158 runs and took 401 wickets in first-class cricket.\nThe son of a greengrocer, Lee worked hard to earn himself a place in the Middlesex side in the years before the First World War, eventually getting his chance in 1914 when other players had joined the early war effort. Lee enlisted in the army in September 1914 and served until December 1915; although shot in the leg, declared dead and taken prisoner of war, he survived and returned to play for Middlesex in 1919. He secured his place in the team with three strong all-round seasons, and was twice part of a top four when each batsman scored a century in the same innings\u2014he shares this achievement with Jack Hearne. Less prolific through the mid-1920s, he scored runs heavily once again towards the end of the decade. He made his only Test appearance in 1931, drafted into the England team after injuries and illness depleted the squad. He continued playing county cricket until 1934, when he was released by Middlesex aged 44, to allow the county to develop younger players. He umpired first-class cricket from his retirement until the Second World War, standing in 153 matches.\nLee's career was overshadowed by more attractive, faster-scoring batsmen in the team, such as Hearne and Patsy Hendren.  His two younger brothers also played first-class cricket; both Jack and Frank moved to Somerset after failing to break into the Middlesex team. All three brothers scored centuries during the 1931 season, the first instance of three professional brothers doing so in first-class cricket. Two years later, all three were involved in a single dismissal: Harry was caught by Frank off the bowling of Jack in a county match. At the time of his death in 1981, Lee was the second-oldest living Test cricketer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown", "response": ["* Harry Lee (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Harry Lee", "response": ["Harry Lee may refer to Harry Lee Kuan Yew (1923\u20132015), first Prime Minister of Singapore, or", "* Harry Lee (cricketer) (1890\u20131981), English cricketer", "* Harry Lee (tennis) (1907\u20131998), British tennis player", "* Harry Lee (athlete) (1877\u20131937), American track and field athlete", "* Harry Lee (footballer, born 1887) (1887\u2013?), English football forward", "* Harry Lee (footballer, born 1933), English footballer", "* Harry Lee (footballer, born 1995), English footballer", "* Harry Lee (Canadian football) (born 1932), Canadian football player", "* Harry Lee (United States Marine) (1872\u20131935), US Marine Corps General and military governor of Santo Domingo", "* Harry Lee (sheriff) (1932\u20132007), Chinese-American sheriff of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana", "* Harry Lee (shell collector) (living), American shell collector"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Harry Lee \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Frank Lee (cricketer)", "response": ["Lee's brothers also played first-class cricket. Harry Lee, 15 years older than Frank Lee, was a batsman and spin bowler for Middlesex from 1911 to 1934 and played in one Test match.

He had been shot in the leg at the Battle of Aubers Ridge and lay for three days between the lines before being taken into German custody and repatriated as a hopeless case. His leg, although shortened and withered, recovered enough for him to make a century at Lancing in 1917.  Unable to serve again in the forces he took a position in 1917 as cricket and football coach to the Maharajah of Cooch Behar and was booked to sail to India on the S.S. Nyanza.  At the last moment his passage was switched to the Nagoya:  the Nyanza was torpedoed just out of Plymouth.  He went on to play 437 first-class games and a Test match for England, against South Africa at Johannesburg in February 1931."]}]}}
