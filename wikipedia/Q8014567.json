One of the main protagonists in the legalisation of roundarm, he was one of the most successful bowlers of his era. His status is borne out by his nickname: The Nonpareil.\nLillywhite's known first-class career spanned the 1825 to 1853 seasons, and he played for Sussex County Cricket Club as well as the Marylebone Cricket Club, and also represented Surrey, Hampshire, and Middlesex in the period before the formation of the current county clubs. Detailed bowling figures for many of his matches are not known: he took 1576 wickets in 237 matches, and took 155 five-wicket-hauls and 55 ten-wicket-hauls. He was an original member of William Clarke's All-England Eleven. Part of a cricketing dynasty, he was the father of John Lillywhite and Fred Lillywhite, and uncle of James Lillywhite.", "link_mentions": {}}}
