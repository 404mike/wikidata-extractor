For example, Yorgos Tsemperopoulos held a 2-hour seminar at the University of Edinburgh in 2014 as part of the Festival activities.

At the 2016 Festival, a Q&A session also followed the screening of Short Fuse and involved its co-screenwriter Kostas Skiftas and producer/co-screenwriter Konstantinos Moutsinas.
