He held up a banner reading, \"Lambrakis RIP\", referring to a Greek MP and peace activist who had been murdered.  According to Rooum's account, the banner was confiscated by a police officer and read by four plain clothes men.  Rooum asked, \"Can I have my banner back?\"  He was approached by one of the officers: \"This big one with the short-back-and-sides stepped forward. 'Can you have your what back?' \"'My banner.\"  \"He smiled at me.  'You're fucking nicked, my old beauty,' he said, and gave me a terrific clout on the ear.\"Rooum, Donald, \"I've dislodged a bit of brick\", Anarchy, No.36, Vol.4. No.2, February 1964 At the police station, the officer, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, \"took from his pocket a screwed-up newspaper, which he opened with a flourish.  Inside was a piece of brick.  His smile widened. 'There you are, my old beauty.  Carrying an offensive weapon.  You can get two years for that.'\" Rooum was a member of the National Council of Civil Liberties and he had, by good fortune, read some material on forensic science and so gave his clothes to his defence solicitor Stanley Clinton Davis for analysis. No brick dust was found in his pocket and Rooum convinced the magistrate that therefore no brick could have been there at the time of the alleged offence.Link to article on Challenor, mentioning Rooum's role in exposing him James Morton (1993) Bent Coppers pp.118\u20139 There followed a public inquiry that criticised the police and led to the imprisonment of three officers.Parliamentary question by Shirley Summerskill to Home Office ministers Report of Enquiry, by Mr A.E.James, QC, 1965 HMSO, Cmnd 2735 Rooum received \u00a3500 compensation (\u00a39,655 at 2017 value) and other convictions were overturned. Challenor was deemed mentally unfit to plead and was committed to Netherne mental hospital. A subsequent enquiry found that he had probably been suffering from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia for some months before the incident, but the lack of any successful prosecution against him was seen by some as evidence of further establishment corruption.Parliamentary question to Attorney General re Challenor by Arthur Lewis"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Arthur Lewis"]}, {"page": "Arthur Lewis", "response": ["Arthur Lewis may refer to:", "*Arthur Lewis (athlete) (born 1972), American Paralympic athlete ", "*Arthur Lewis (English cricketer) (1901\u20131980), English cricketer", "*Arthur Lewis (Australian cricketer) (1830\u20131907), Australian cricketer", "*Arthur Lewis (Australian politician) (1882\u20131975), member of the Australian Parliament", "*Arthur Lewis (British politician) (1917\u20131998), English Labour MP for Newham North West", "*Arthur Lewis (rugby union) (born 1941), former Wales and British Lions international rugby union player", "*Arthur Lewis (photographer) (1885\u20131952), Welsh photographer", "*Arthur Lewis (art director)", "*W.
