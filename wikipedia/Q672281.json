Mortensen equalised after 35 minutes with a deflected \"cross-shot\". Four minutes later, Bolton took the lead again when Willie Moir outstripped Blackpool's goalkeeper George Farm after short crossing pass of Bobby Langton and Bolton went in at half-time 2\u20131 ahead. Ten minutes into the second half, Eric Bell, playing through injury with a torn hamstring, put Bolton further ahead, a lead they kept for 13 minutes. Then came the turnaround for which the match has become famous, when Matthews proved to be the inspiration for a Blackpool comeback. His cross from the right wing, with 22 minutes remaining, was met by Mortensen who netted his and Blackpool's second goal. Then, with less than two minutes remaining, Mortensen completed his hat-trick and Blackpool's comeback to equalise directly from a free-kick. Then, with just seconds remaining, Matthews again crossed from the right wing. His cross, which passed just behind Mortensen, was met by Bill Perry, whose shot made the score 4\u20133 and won the match for the Seasiders. Even Nat Lofthouse, in defeat, is said to have stood and applauded.", "|LH ||6|| Eric Bell"]}, {"page": "Eric Bell (disambiguation)", "response": ["Eric Bell (born 1947) is an Irish musician; lead guitarist for Thin Lizzy.", "Eric Bell may also refer to:", "* Eric Bell (baseball) (born 1963), American baseball player", "* Eric Bell (footballer, born 1929) (1929\u20132012), English football player", "* Eric Bell (footballer, born 1922) (1922\u20132004), English footballer", "* Rico Bell (a.k.a.
