He was born in Edgware.Salvat was a magazine designer in London and the Amateur Athletics Association three mile champion before competing in international events, running for Great Britain against France in the 5,000m at White City and in the Olympics later that year. He was a member of Finchley Harriers, now Hillingdon Athletic Club, in northwest London.Athletics agent Eric Shirley Jr, whose father Eric Shirley was Salvat's training partner, said: \"He was an amazing man with an amazing amount of charisma. His pre-race diet, two hours before he competed, even at the very highest international level, would be a pie and a pint. It's not unknown for him to start a race with a brandy glass in his hand, hand it over to someone, and even have a cigar waiting for him at the end.\"Salvat died in poverty in Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex on 24 April 2013. Nobody claimed his body after his death and he would have had a pauper's funeral, but pubs and businesses in Hurstpierpoint, as well as his former athletics club, raised money for a funeral and a wake.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hurstpierpoint", "response": ["A notable local resident was Jimmy Hill, former Match of the Day presenter and football player, manager and chairman, who was generous of his time for local events, clubs and societies until his death on 19 December 2015 aged 87.
