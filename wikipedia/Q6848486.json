A close ally of the Communist Party USA (CP) for the first twelve years of his leadership of the union, he broke with it in 1948. \nQuill had varying relations with the mayors of New York City. He was a personal friend of Robert F. Wagner Jr. but could find no common ground with Wagner's successor, John Lindsay, or as Quill called him \"Linsley\", and led a twelve-day transit strike in 1966 against him that landed him in jail. However, he won significant wage increases for his members. He died of a heart attack three days after the end of the strike. Quill's leadership is not only noted for his success in improving workers' rights but also for his commitment to racial equality, even preceding the Civil Rights Era.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1966", "response": ["* January 2 \u2013 1966 New York City transit strike: A wildcat strike by public transportation workers in New York City, led by Mike Quill, begins, designed to coincide with the beginning of Republican John V.
