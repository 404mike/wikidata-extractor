He is shown as being first in the Derbyshire batting lineup and yet not out for just six runs in the second innings, for a team total score of 118. A possible explanation is that he retired hurt early in the game but returned later for another attempt at bat. He was a right-handed batsman and made 9 runs in his single first-class appearance.Needham died at Taddington at the age of 27.", "link_mentions": {}}}
