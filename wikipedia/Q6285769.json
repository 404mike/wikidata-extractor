He is shown as being first in the Derbyshire batting lineup and yet not out for just six runs in the second innings, for a team total score of 118. A possible explanation is that he retired hurt early in the game but returned later for another attempt at bat. He was a right-handed batsman and made 9 runs in his single first-class appearance.Needham died at Taddington at the age of 27.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Needham", "response": ["After graduation, Needham was elected to a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College and worked in Hopkins' laboratory at the University Department of Biochemistry, specialising in embryology and morphogenesis. His three-volume work Chemical Embryology, published in 1931, includes a history of embryology from Egyptian times up to the early 19th century, including quotations in most European languages. His Terry Lecture of 1936 was published by Cambridge University Press in association with Yale University Press under the title of Order and Life. In 1939 he produced a massive work on morphogenesis that a Harvard reviewer claimed \"will go down in the history of science as Joseph Needham's magnum opus,\" little knowing what would come later.", "Three Chinese scientists came to Cambridge for graduate study in 1937: Lu Gwei-djen, Wang Ying-lai and Shen Shih-Chang (\u6c88\u8a69\u7ae0, the only one under Needham's tutelage). Lu, daughter of a Nanjing pharmacist, taught Needham Chinese, igniting his interest in China's ancient technological and scientific past. He then pursued, and mastered, the study of Classical Chinese privately with Gustav Haloun.Gregory, 'Joseph Needham,' in Peter Harman, Simon Mitton, (eds.)

In fact it was Needham who insisted that science should be included in the organisation's mandate at an earlier planning meeting. After two years in which the suspicions of the Americans over scientific co-operation with communists intensified, Needham resigned in 1948 and returned to Gonville and Caius College, where he resumed his fellowship and his rooms, which were soon filled with his books. He devoted his energy to the history of Chinese science until his retirement in 1990, even though he continued to teach some biochemistry until 1993.", "detract from his argument.Pierre-Yves Manguin: \"Trading Ships of the South China Sea.

When he and Lu Gwei-djen met in 1937, they fell deeply in love, which Dorothy accepted. The three of them eventually lived contentedly on the same road in Cambridge for many years. In 1989, two years after Dorothy's death, Needham married Lu, who died two years later. He suffered from Parkinson's disease from 1982, and died at the age of 94 at his Cambridge home.
