He made it clear that he intended to incorporate more of the feeling of claustrophobia like that of a particular scene in the previous film. Marshall told Bloody-Disgusting.com about new ideas for the film, \"The monsters they can deal with, and a bit of the claustrophobia, they can deal with, but the combination is definitely something we want to incorporate that into the sequel, by putting the monster and the girls in a really tight spot.\" Jon Harris, the editor of the first film, was brought on to direct and edit the sequel.
