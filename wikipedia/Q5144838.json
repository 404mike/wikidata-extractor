In the 1990s he was the Head of Northern Broadcasting at the BBC, before in 1997 he was rather surprisingly appointed as the Corporation's Head of Television Drama. Adams was an unexpected choice for the position as he had no background in drama programming, but the Corporation was eager to appoint somebody to the position which had not had a full-time occupant since the previous year, when Charles Denton had left.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC television drama", "response": ["There was much criticism in the press over the inability of the BBC to find a full-time Head of Drama, with even the BBC Chairman Sir Christopher Bland criticising the amount of time it was taking to find a new Head of Department, stating publicly that: \"There aren't a lot of people who are pre-eminently qualified and able to do the biggest job in drama. That's the difficulty.\" . Experienced BBC Drama staff such as Michael Wearing (Head of Serials) were leaving the department, which was seen to be in trouble after the failure of hugely expensive productions such as the historical drama Rhodes in 1996. \"Many in the drama business, and not just BBC insiders, are worried about the hand-over of creative say to the controllers, low morale and the lack of a head,\"  The Guardian reported in December 1996. Finally in June 1997 Colin Adams was appointed as the new Head of Drama. Adams was a surprising choice, his previous role at the Corporation having been as Head of Northern Broadcasting. However, he was essentially an administrator and seen by Drama staff as a temporary appointment."]}, {"page": "Colin Adams", "response": ["Colin Adams is the name of:", "*Colin Adams (executive), British TV executive", "*Colin Adams (mathematician) (born 1956), American mathematician and author"]}]}}
