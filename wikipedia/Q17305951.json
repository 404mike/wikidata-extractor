More recently two major new theories have been proposed. Geoffrey Wainwright, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and Timothy Darvill, of Bournemouth University, have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing\u2014the primeval equivalent of Lourdes. They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves. However, they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well. Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions. A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the \"Amesbury Archer\" grew up near the Alpine foothills of Germany; and the \"Boscombe Bowmen\" probably arrived from Wales or Brittany, France."]}, {"page": "Archaeological excavation", "response": ["This describes the use in excavations of various types and sizes of machines from small backhoes to heavy duty earth-moving machinery. Machines are often used in what is called salvage or rescue archaeology in developer-led excavation when there are financial or time pressures. Using a mechanical excavator is the quickest method to remove soil and debris and to prepare the surface for excavation by hand, taking care to avoid damaging archaeological deposits by accident or to make it difficult to identify later precisely where finds were located. The use of such machinery is often routine (as it is for instance with the British archaeological television series Time Team) but can also be controversial as it can result in less discrimination in how the archaeological sequence on a site is recorded. One of the earliest uses of earth-moving machinery was at Durrington Walls in 1967. An old road through the henge was to be straightened and improved and was going to cause considerable damage to the archaeology. Rosemary Hill describes how Geoffrey Wainwright \"oversaw large, high-speed excavations, taking bulldozers to the site in a manner that shocked some of his colleagues but yielded valuable if tantalising information about what Durrington had looked like and how it might have been used.\" Machines are used primarily to remove modern overburden and for the control of spoil. In British archaeology mechanical diggers are sometimes nicknamed \"big yellow trowels\"."]}, {"page": "Durrington Walls", "response": ["Richard Colt Hoare noted Durrington Walls in 1810, and observed that centuries of agriculture had left \"its form much mutilated\".Stonehenge and Avebury: The World Heritage Site.

Consisting of large oak timbers placed at 50\u00a0cm intervals it would have served as a huge barrier to the middle of the site. Evidence that the timber posts that had stood in the trench were burnt was also seen. The excavator, Geoffrey Wainwright, estimated that 1600 timbers had stood in the trench, enclosing an area of 45,000 m\u00b2. Two entrances were found in the palisade, each only 1m wide. The timber enclosure was built around 500 years after the outer henge enclosure and caused the builders to remodel the enclosure earthworks."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Wainwright", "response": ["Geoffrey Wainwright (1939 \u2013 17 March 2020) was an English theologian.
