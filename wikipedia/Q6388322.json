Ken Pounds, the President of the RAS from 1990-2, proposed expanding their remit into a more general meeting, inspired by the large meetings of the British Association and the American Astronomical Society. The goal was to attract a broad section of the UK astronomy research community and provide a focus for media attention on the discipline. To reflect this newly expanded format, the series was re-named the 'National Astronomy Meeting' (NAM) from 1992 onwards."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (K)", "response": ["*Ken Pounds"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Alwyne Pounds", "response": ["#REDIRECTKen Pounds"]}]}}
