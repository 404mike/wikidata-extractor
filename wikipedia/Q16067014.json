After beating Rotherham County in a qualifying tie, Palace were  drawn away to Newcastle United in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another title. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Palace scored through Horace Astley against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock 1\u20130 win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of Fulham and Brentford respectively, the latter after a replay, and in the quarter-finals, Palace were drawn at home to First Division club Everton, who were flying high in second place. In front of a then record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4\u20130 winners.Matthews, pp.15\u201316"]}, {"page": "George Woodger", "response": ["Born in Croydon, he signed for Crystal Palace in 1905 from local club Thornton Heath Wednesday, and played a part in their 1\u20130 away win against Newcastle United in the FA Cup in 1907.

The decision seemed to unnerve Newcastle, and they once again lost impetus. Palace then took the lead through Horace Astley not long before half-time. Reports differ as to whether Astley seized on a clearance or received a pass from George Woodger,* but the old Millwall opportunist managed to evade the Newcastle defenders and crash a shot past an astonished Jimmy Lawrence. The Magpies started the second half the stronger side, but although they had the better of the play and possession, they failed to make it count. Palace were quick on the counter-attack, and Lawrence twice had to deny Woodger the chance to double the lead in the fifteen minutes after the restart. Palace's attacking energy was lost after a crunching collision between Newcastle's forward Speedie and Palace's centre half Ryan.  Both men were injured, and whilst Newcastle pushed Speedie out wide, Palace left Ryan in the middle but also pulled back Woodger, Astley and Harker in an attempt to close the game down. With Palace sitting back, Newcastle threw everything into attacking football. With six minutes to go Ryan was again injured, this time forced off the field, leaving Palace reduced to ten men.", "| ||  || Horace Astley"]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Horace Astley"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Horace Astley"]}, {"page": "1907\u201308 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["The 1907\u201308 season was one of change for the new club.  John Robson departed the club to manage Brighton and Hove Albion, and club secretary Edmund Goodman stepped in to take over the role.  Goodman's first problem was to find a replacement for goalkeeper Bob Hewitson. Hewitson had departed for Oldham, and his early replacement was William Hall of Manchester City. Hall played in the first ten games before losing his place to Josh Johnson, signed from Plymouth Argyle. Johnson swiftly established himself as first choice and would go on to play 295 times for the first team. Dick Harker left for Hibernian and Charlie Wallace was snapped up by Aston Villa, where he would go on to win both the Football League and the FA Cup.
