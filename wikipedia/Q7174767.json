Hucker had been at the club since he was a junior but had played very few games. He had seen a succession of managers bring their own preferred goalkeepers in while he bided his time in the reserves.\nHe got his big chance in a FA Cup Third Round tie at Loftus Road in 1982 against Middlesbrough. The first-choice keeper at the time, John Burridge, was injured but was also not very keen on playing on the synthetic playing surface that Loftus Road had at the time. Hucker played very well in the cup tie and retained his place for the remainder of the season, including in the 1982 FA Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur in which he was voted the 'Man of the Match' for his performance in the first game, in which he played extremely well despite being injured.\nHucker was to play a key role the following season as well as QPR stormed to the Second Division title and then the following year as Rangers finished top London club in the 1983\u201384 season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Like many of the talented players of that team his form suffered as Terry Venables left the club in 1984 to be replaced by Alan Mullery. He lost his place during the 1985\u201386 season (to Paul Barron and he transferred to Oxford United in February 1987. Hucker played 160 league games for QPR.\nIn a three-year spell at Oxford, Hucker played 66 league matches, but towards the end of his time there, he went on several loan spells, first to West Bromwich Albion in 1987\u201388, making seven appearances, and then twice to Manchester United without making a single appearance.\nHe finished his career in non-league football and went on to establish a successful goalkeeping coaching school after retiring from the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Loftus Road", "response": ["During the summer of 1981 an artificial pitch of Omniturf was installed at Loftus Road, the first such surface to be used in British professional football. The surface was not favoured by everyone, with QPR keeper Peter Hucker describing it as \"basically a bit of carpet over two feet of concrete\", and stated that as a goalkeeper, he strongly disliked diving onto it saying that \"I'd have close to third degree burns because the pitch would totally rip the skin off.\" Rangers lost the first league match played on the new surface 1-2 versus Luton Town on 1 September 1981. During the time that Loftus Road had the Omniturf pitch installed, QPR reached two cup finals and became Second Division champions, something that critics claimed was caused by the advantage the pitch presented, and QPR's home games in the 1984\u201385 UEFA Cup were played at Arsenal's Highbury Stadium. It was claimed that manager Terry Venables would let opposition teams train on the pitch when it was dry, and then deliberately dampen the pitch so that the ball played differently to what they expected at kick off. It was removed in April 1988 because of football legislation and replaced with grass. There were just three other league stadiums in the whole country with a plastic pitch, and by 1994 all of these had been ripped up."]}, {"page": "John Burridge", "response": ["In 1975, Burridge joined Aston Villa for \u00a375,000. He was signed by Ron Saunders and spent two seasons at Villa Park, winning the League Cup with them, but eventually lost his place to Jimmy Rimmer. He had a short but successful loan spell at Southend United before joining Crystal Palace in 1978, signed by Terry Venables. In a 4\u20131 victory over Ipswich Town, after Palace went 4\u20130 up, Burridge, to entertain the fans, sat on the crossbar. After two and a half seasons at Palace, he joined London rivals Queens Park Rangers, again signed by Venables. He was dropped in favour of Peter Hucker for the 1982 FA Cup Final."]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 in English football", "response": ["27 November 1984: QPR and Southampton play out a goalless Milk Cup replay at Loftus Road. Steve Moran has an 85th minute penalty saved by Rs' keeper Peter Hucker."]}, {"page": "Peter hucker", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Hucker "]}, {"page": "1982 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The first game was a tense and largely dull game of few clear cut chances. QPR's young goalkeeper Peter Hucker was certainly the busier keeper although Spurs were mainly being kept to long range efforts. Hucker's performance in the first match would ultimately earn him the Man of the Match award. QPR were not outclassed however, although their attacking options were hindered when prolific striker Clive Allen, who had scored the winner in the semi-final, was injured early in the game and was a peripheral figure thereafter. He was replaced by Gary Micklewhite five minutes into the second half. Ninety minutes came and went with the score 0\u20130. With ten minutes of extra time remaining, Glenn Hoddle found himself just outside the QPR penalty box. His shot took a deflection (off Tony Currie) and found the right-hand corner of Hucker's goal. Not to be outdone, five minutes later Simon Stainrod took a long throw ten yards from the Spurs goal line. Rangers' burly centre-back Bob Hazell, flicked the ball on at the near post and Terry Fenwick headed the ball past Spurs keeper Ray Clemence at point-blank range, making the final score 1\u20131.", "The replay took place at Wembley five days later. Clive Allen had not recovered from his injury and his replacement on the Saturday, Gary Micklewhite, started the game. Early in the game after only six minutes had elapsed, the Spurs midfielder Graham Roberts broke through into the Rangers penalty area. Rangers' captain on the evening, Tony Currie (regular captain Glenn Roeder was suspended), made a lunge to get the ball but only succeeded in bringing Roberts down. It was a clear penalty. Glenn Hoddle coolly slotted the penalty away sending Peter Hucker the wrong way. QPR soon managed to get into the game though and before long had the ball in the net by Micklewhite, but the goal was disallowed for an offside against Stainrod. It was fair to say that for  much of the rest of the game they were the better side, taking the game to their more highly fancied opponents. The only thing they could not manage to do was score. The closest they came was in the second half when John Gregory received a raking long pass from the left wing from Simon Stainrod and spotted Spurs keeper Ray Clemence slightly off his line. Gregory's audacious volleyed chip from just inside the box however, agonisingly hit the crossbar and bounced to safety. Steve Archibald hit the post late on for Spurs but Hoddle's early penalty remained the only goal, and Spurs retained the trophy just as they had done in 1962. Spurs became the only team to win three FA Cup Final replays, as well as the only team to win FA Cup Final replays in successive years.", "|GK ||1 || Peter Hucker", "|GK ||1 || Peter Hucker"]}, {"page": "Langdon Academy", "response": ["* Peter Hucker, goalkeeper for QPR"]}, {"page": "Hucker", "response": ["*Peter Hucker (born 1959), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Hucker, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Hucker"]}]}}
