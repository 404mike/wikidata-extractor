She was born and raised in Alton, Hampshire, England, and became involved in the local folk club scene in the late 1960s. She has played in a number of bands and formed a number of collaborations with other artists, but has become well known in recent times as a solo artist and songwriter. She enjoys singing songs with meaningful words and has named her major influences as Bob Dylan, Al Stewart, Dave Evans, Leon Rosselson, Billy Bragg, Bruce Cockburn and Robb Johnson. Several of her own songs have entered the repertoires of notable artists, such as Martin Carthy and June Tabor and, in 2000, Holland received the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards \"Best Song of 1999\" for her song \"A Place Called England\".

The flower to which the song's lyrics refer is one of England's national emblems, the Tudor Rose. The patriotic hymn \"I Vow To Thee, My Country\", composed by Gustav Holst and Cecil Spring Rice, has long been adopted as a symbol of national pride and remembrance, and is often considered among potential future anthems for the United Kingdom altogether. Also, \"There'll Always Be an England\", an English patriotic song, written and distributed in 1940 and highly popular throughout World War II. It was composed and written by Ross Parker. The words were written by Hughie Charles, and the most popular version was sung by Vera Lynn. 1950s comedy duo Flanders and Swann premiered \"Song of Patriotic Prejudice\" (with refrain \"The English, the English, the English are best/I wouldn't give tuppence for all of the rest\") in their At the Drop of Another Hat revue in London on 2 October 1963.
