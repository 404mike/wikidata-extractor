Nottinghamshire had their own complaints, and protested to the MCC regarding Crossland's residential qualification to play for Lancashire. During the previous season, a letter had been written to Cricket magazine suggesting that Crossland's qualification for Lancashire was invalid, as they claimed that although he was engaged on the Old Trafford ground staff for the summer, he continued to reside in Sutton-in-Ashfield during the winter. Crossland was summoned to Lord's over the matter, but the Lancashire committee refused to send him, stating that he was playing for them that day.. The protest was eventually dismissed, though the MCC noted that \"it would be of value ... to have the evidence on both sides for future reference.\" Neutral umpires were introduced in 1883, and there was some concern in Lancashire about whether Crossland would be no-balled during the first match of the year. The match against Derbyshire featured one of the most highly regarded umpires, Thomas Brownhill from Yorkshire, and Crossland bowled without censure. In June that season, Crossland travelled as part of the Lancashire team to Lord's, to play against the Marylebone Cricket Club. The umpires for the match had been advised to be strict in applying the law on throwing, and it was noted in the press that Crossland had modified his bowling action, and no complaints could be made against it.. The Daily News did suggest that \"if [Crossland] always bowled as he bowled yesterday there would be no disputes about him\u2014and he would not get many wickets.\""]}, {"page": "Brownhill (surname)", "response": ["*Thomas Brownhill (1838\u20131915), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Brownhill, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Brownhill"]}]}}
