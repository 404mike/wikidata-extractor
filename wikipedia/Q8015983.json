Captain William Mynors named it on Christmas Day (25\u00a0December) 1643. It was first settled in the late 19th\u00a0century. Christmas Island's geographic isolation and history of minimal human disturbance has led to a high level of endemism among its flora and fauna, which is of interest to scientists and naturalists. The majority (63\u00a0percent) of the island is included in the Christmas Island National Park, which features several areas of primary monsoonal forest. Phosphate, deposited originally as guano, has been mined on the island since 1899.", "The first European to sight the island was Richard Rowe of the Thomas in 1615.
