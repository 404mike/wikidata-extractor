He resigned the Chair of Astronomy to become Professor of Natural Philosophy in 1803, a position he held until his death in 1846.\nMeikleham's first post was Rector of Ayr Academy in 1792. In 1794 he was employed as assistant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy. He conducted his duties so successfully that he continued to take classes after the incumbent Professor's death and during the tenure of his successor.\nIn August 1799, King George III issued a commission to William Meikleham to be Professor of Practical Astronomy and Observer at the University of Glasgow, and on 29 October 1799 he was admitted to office.\nProfessor William Meikleham had none of the fiercely conservative attitudes of others in the University.  He proved to be a much more active and dynamic teacher than his colleagues, including his successor in the Chair of Practical Astronomy, James Couper.", "link_mentions": {}}}
