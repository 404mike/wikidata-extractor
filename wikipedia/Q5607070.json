Besides the plots to assassinate him by agents of the Queen of England, the rebels against the rule of the Spanish Crown, encouraged by Elizabeth and her emissaries, now present in Douai, expelled the students of the University from Douai in March 1578. Allen then re-established the College at Rheims, a city then under the patronage and protection of the House of Guise. The collegians took refuge at the University of Rheims, where they were well received, and continued their work as before, and Allen was soon afterwards elected a canon in the Chapter of Rheims Cathedral. Thomas Stapleton, Richard Bristow, Gregory Martin, and Morgan Phillips were amongst Allen's companions."]}, {"page": "Book of Judith", "response": ["In 16th-century France, writers such as Guillaume Du Bartas, Gabrielle de Coignard and Anne de Marquets composed poems on Judith's triumph over Holofernes.  Croatian poet and humanist Marko Maruli\u0107 also wrote an epic on Judith's story in 1501, the Judita. The Catholic tract A Treatise of Schisme, written in 1578 at Douai by the English Roman Catholic scholar Gregory Martin, included a paragraph in which Martin expressed confidence that \"the Catholic Hope would triumph, and pious Judith would slay Holofernes\". This was interpreted by the English Protestant authorities at the time as incitement to slay Queen Elizabeth I. It served as the grounds for the death sentence passed on printer William Carter who had printed Martin's tract and who was executed in 1584."]}, {"page": "Douay\u2013Rheims Bible", "response": ["A run of a few hundred or more of the New Testament, in quarto form (not large folio), was published in the last months of 1582 (Herbert #177), during a temporary migration of the college to Rheims; consequently, it has been commonly known as the Rheims New Testament. Though he died in the same year as its publication, this translation was principally the work of Gregory Martin, formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford, close friend of Edmund Campion. He was assisted by others at Douai, notably Allen, Richard Bristow, and Thomas Worthington, who proofed and provided notes and annotations. The Old Testament is stated to have been ready at the same time but, for want of funds, it could not be printed until later, after the college had returned to Douai. It is commonly known as the Douay Old Testament. It was issued as two quarto volumes dated 1609 and 1610 (Herbert #300). Surprisingly these first New Testament and Old Testament editions followed the Geneva Bible not only in their quarto format but also in the use of Roman type."]}, {"page": "Cuthbert Mayne", "response": ["At Oxford, Mayne met Edmund Campion and other Catholics, such as Gregory Martin, Humphrey Ely, Henry Shaw, Thomas Bramston, Henry Holland, Jonas Meredith, and Roland Russell. At some point Mayne, too, became a Catholic. Late in 1570, a letter addressed to him from Gregory Martin, urging him to come to Douai, fell into the hands of the Bishop of London, and he sent a pursuivant to arrest Mayne and others mentioned in the letter. Warned by Thomas Ford, Mayne evaded arrest by going to Cornwall and then, in 1573, to the English College, Douai (now in northern France)."]}, {"page": "Gregory Martin", "response": ["*Gregory Martin (scholar) (c. 1542\u20131582), Catholic Priest, scholar, and Bible translator", "*Gregory Martin (wrestler), professional wrestler, see MCW Cruiserweight Championship"]}, {"page": "William Carter (martyr)", "response": ["Among Catholic books he printed a new edition (1000 copies) of Gregory Martin's \"A Treatise of Schisme\", in 1580, for which he was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London, 1582, and paid for his own meals there down to midsummer, 1583.

Bishop John Milner wrote a pamphlet to defend it from one of the Protestant attacks which its republication early in the nineteenth century provoked."]}, {"page": "George Leo Haydock", "response": ["Haydock's tenure at Ugthorpe came during  a critical period when the long era of persecution of English Catholics was finally drawing to a close.  There was significant agreement even among Protestants that the Penal Laws should be repealed.  However, forces opposing repeal were organized for a last ditch effort.  According to the historian Lingard (q.v.)  \u201cThe [Anglican] clergy have been placed in the front of the battle; and, with the cry of danger to the church has been coupled that of danger to the constitution.  To perpetuate religious disabilities, episcopal charges have been published, meetings of the clergy have been held, and petitions from dioceses, colleges  and arch-deaconries have been poured into both houses of parliament.  In aid of these efforts, the press has also been put into requisition:  and the labours of anti-catholic journalists, the establishment of an anti-catholic magazine, and the diffusion of anti-catholic tracts, published in every shape, and adapted to every understanding, bear honourable testimony to the zeal and activity of those who assume the lead in this orthodox crusade.\u201d  Lingard, p. 1 Haydock saw a need to meet this challenge.  Since interpretations of Scripture were a significant part of  the anti-repeal effort,  Haydock set out to complete what would become his  Magnum Opus:  commentary for a new edition of the English Catholic Bible. That Bible was called the Douay Version (Douay-Rheims Bible), originally translated from the Latin Vulgate in the 16th century chiefly by Gregory Martin, one of the first professors at the English College, Douai (University of Douai).  It was revised and newly annotated in the 18th century by Richard Challoner (1691\u20131781), a scholar at University of Douai and then Vicar Apostolic of the London District, and later by Father Bernard MacMahon (1736?\u20131816). Haydock took his text from the Challoner-MacMahon revision, but added a substantially extended commentary.  This commentary was partly original and partly compiled from Patristic writings and the writings of later Bible scholars. It was intended as a counter-offensive to Protestant interpretations.   As Haydock states in his Preface, \"To obviate the misinterpretations of the many heretical works which disgrace the Scripture, and deluge this unhappy country, has been one main design of the present undertaking.\" "]}, {"page": "Thomas Haydock", "response": ["The Doway or Douay Bible (Douay-Rheims Bible) was the standard translation for English speaking Catholics.  It was originally translated from the Latin Vulgate in the 16th century chiefly by Gregory Martin, one of the first professors at the English Catholic College affiliated to the university of Douai. It was revised and newly annotated in the 18th century by Richard Challoner q.v., a scholar from university of Douai.  Shortly after Challoner's death, Father Bernard MacMahon (1736?-1816) published further revisions of the Douay-Rheims Bible. A large new edition of the Bible complete with an extended commentary seems a daunting project for a publisher of Haydock's limited means.  He may have been encouraged by the success of a similar Protestant effort:  the self-interpreting Bible of John Brown (Theologian, 1722\u20131787), first published in 1778 and frequently reprinted.  The contemporary controversy swirling around efforts to repeal the Penal Laws and the place of Biblical exegetics in that controversy were certainly major encouraging factors for the proposed new Bible.  In any case, Haydock's great enthusiasm for the Catholic cause was sufficient to overcome all obstacles."]}, {"page": "John Fowler (Catholic scholar)", "response": ["In 1577 Fowler relocated to Douai, where he printed Gregory Martin's Treatise of Schism in 1578.
