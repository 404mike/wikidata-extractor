The proposal that the order of nature showed evidence of having its own human-like \"intelligence\" goes back to the origins of Greek natural philosophy and science, and its attention to the orderliness of nature, often with special reference to the revolving of the heavens. Anaxagoras is the first person who is definitely known to have explained such a concept using the word \"nous\" (which is the original Greek term that leads to modern English \"intelligence\" via its Latin and French translations). Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher from Clazomenae named Hermotimus who had taken a similar position.Metaphysics I.4.984b. Amongst Pre-Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar intelligent ordering principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example Empedocles, like Hesiod much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of love,Kirk, Raven, and Schofield. 1983. The Presocratic Philosophers (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ch. 10. and Pythagoras and Heraclitus attributed the cosmos with \"reason\" (logos).Kirk, Raven, and Schofield. 1983. The Presocratic Philosophers (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 204, 235. In his Philebus 28c Plato has Socrates speak of this as a tradition, saying that \"all philosophers agree\u2014whereby they really exalt themselves\u2014that mind (nous) is king of heaven and earth.

According to Epicureanism, the gods do not interfere with human lives or the rest of the universe in any way \u2013 thus, it shuns the idea that frightening weather events are divine retribution.James Warren (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Epicureanism, p. 124 One of the fears the Epicurean ought to be freed from is fear relating to the actions of the gods.James Warren (ed.), The Cambridge companion to Epicureanism, p. 105 The manner in which the Epicurean gods exist is still disputed. Some scholars say that Epicureanism believes that the gods exist outside the mind as material objects (the realist position), while others assert that the gods only exist in our minds as ideals (the idealist position). The realist position holds that Epicureans understand the gods as existing as physical and immortal beings made of atoms that reside somewhere in reality. However, the gods are completely separate from the rest of reality; they are uninterested in it, play no role in it, and remain completely undisturbed by it. Instead, the gods live in what is called the metakosmia, or the space between worlds. Contrarily, the idealist (sometimes called the \u201cnon-realist position\u201d to avoid confusion) position holds that the gods are just idealized forms of the best human life, and it is thought that the gods were emblematic of the life one should aspire towards. The debate between these two positions was revived by A. A. Long and David Sedley in their 1987 book, The Hellenistic Philosophers, in which the two argued in favour of the idealist position. While a scholarly consensus has yet to be reached, the realist position remains the prevailing viewpoint at this time."]}, {"page": "Gaius Cassius Longinus", "response": ["\"Among that select band of philosophers who have managed to change the world,\" writes David Sedley, \"it would be hard to find a pair with a higher public profile than Brutus and Cassius \u2014 brothers-in-law, fellow-assassins, and Shakespearian heroes,\" adding that \"it may not even be widely known that they were philosophers.\"David Sedley, \"The Ethics of Brutus and Cassius,\" Journal of Roman Studies 87 (1997) 41\u201353.", "The dating bears on, but is not essential to, the question of whether Cassius justified the murder of Caesar on Epicurean grounds.

Romans of the Late Republic who can be identified as Epicureans are more often found among the supporters of Caesar, and often literally in his camp. Momigliano argued, however, that many of those who opposed Caesar's dictatorship bore no personal animus toward him, and Republicanism was more congenial to the Epicurean way of life than dictatorship. The Roman concept of libertas had been integrated into Greek philosophical studies, and though Epicurus' theory of the political governance admitted various forms of government based on consent, including but not limited to democracy, a tyrannical state was regarded by Roman Epicureans as incompatible with the highest good of pleasure, defined as freedom from pain. Tyranny also threatened the Epicurean value of parrhesia (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1), \"truthful speaking,\" and the movement toward deifying Caesar offended Epicurean belief in abstract gods who lead an ideal existence removed from mortal affairs.Arnaldo Momigliano, Journal of Roman Studies 31 (1941), pp. 151\u2013157.

Anaxagoras's theory was that the original state of the world was a roughly even mixture of all opposites, and that it was the effect of the action of nous (intelligence or mind) that led to the partial separation of such opposites, hot from cold, land from water, rarefied from dense. Anaxagoras also developed the philosophical innovation of dualism of mind from matter, diverging from the stringent monism of his predecessor, Parmenides.

As late as the 13th century, Thomas Cantipratensis asserted that some people still regard groves as consecrated to dusii and entered them to sacrifice to \"their own gods\" (suis diis, dative plural of deus); see discussion under Surviving tradition below. The 19th-century Celiticist Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville regarded the dusii as divinities who might be compared to aquatic deities of the Homeric tradition in Greece as lovers who begat children with mortal women; see \"Esus, Tarvos trigaranus,\" Revue Celtique 19 (1898), pp. 228, 234\u2013235, 251 online.

Like these deities, heBoth ancient Greek and Latin categorize nouns within three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Although grammatical gender is distinguished from biological gender, Latin places humans (homines), animals (animalia), and anthropomorphic beings perceived as having sexual characteristics in their gender-specific category. Some \"monsters\" are neuter (the sea monster ketos in Greek, for instance). The dusii are masculine in both grammatical gender and in their sexual behavior in all the sources in which they appear, with the possible exception of Gervase of Tilbury, who seems to think they can also be female; see below. The Greco-Roman deities to whom they are compared are aggressively masculine, often depicted as ithyphallic. might be seen as multiple in nature,The multiplicity of the group of deities to which the dusii belong \u2014 Pan/panes, Faunus/fauni, Inuus/inui, Silvanus/silvani, Incubus/incubi \u2014 is related to the question of monotheistic tendencies in ancient religion: \"Lower gods were executors or manifestations of the divine will rather than independent principles of reality. Whether they are called gods, demons, angels, or numina, these immortal beings are emanations of the One\": Michele Renee Salzman, \"Religious koine in Private Cult and Ritual: Shared Religious Traditions in Roman Religion in the First Half of the Fourth Century CE,\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 113. The name of Pan was sometimes etymologized as meaning \"All\"; although scientific linguistics has shown this derivation to be incorrect, it appears in the Homeric Hymn to Pan (6th century BC) and influenced theological interpretations in antiquity, including the speculations of Plato: see H.J. Rose and Robin Hard, The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology (Routledge, 2004), p. 215 online, and David Sedley, Plato's Cratylus (Cambridge University Press) pp. 96\u201397 online, where Pan as \"all\" is connected to the logos: \"This is the climax of the divine etymologies.\" The \"all-ness\" of Pan accounted for his multiple manifestations, reflected by nominal plurals. On the distinction between modern scientific and ancient theological etymology, see Davide Del Bello, Forgotten Paths: Etymology and the Allegorical Mindset (Catholic University of America Press, 2007). and referred to in the plural (dusioi), most commonly in Latin as dusii. Although the Celtic Dusios is not described in late-antique sources independently of Greek and Roman deities, the common functionality of the others lay in their ability to impregnate animals and women, often by surprise or force. Dusii continue to play a role in the magico-religious belief systems of Gaul and Francia as a type of incubus in early-medieval paganism and Christianity."]}]}}
