He continued in that role until 1944, when Edinburgh asked him to return to teaching there. But he did not find the conditions \u201cat all congenial\u201d, and so he secured an appointment in 1946 at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry under Professor (later Sir) Charles Dodds, where he worked on the proteolytic degradation of insulin. This work was not altogether successful, in part because of the great strides made by Sanger. So, in 1949, Butler moved to the Chester Beatty Research Institute in Chelsea, directed by Alexander Haddow. There were two main themes to his work at the Chester Beatty, one of which \u2013 on the proteins associated with DNA in the structure of chromosomes, the histones \u2013 is especially associated with Butler."]}, {"page": "1966 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Alexander Haddow, , Professor of Experimental Pathology, University of London and Director, Chester Beatty Research Institute, Institute of Cancer Research."]}, {"page": "Sir Alexander Haddow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Haddow"]}, {"page": "James Duncan Robertson", "response": ["He studied Zoology at Glasgow University under Prof John Graham Kerr graduating BSc in 1933.
