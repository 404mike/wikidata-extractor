His Ojibwa name was Kahkew\u0101quon\u0101by (Gakiiwegwanebi in the Fiero spelling), which means \"[Sacred] Waving Feathers\".  In Mohawk, he was called Desagondensta, meaning \"he stands people on their feet\".   In his youth his band of Mississaugas had been on the verge of destruction.  As a preacher and a chieftain, as a role model and as a liaison to governments, his leadership helped his people survive contact with Europeans.\nJones was raised by his mother Tuhbenahneequay in the traditional culture and religion of the Mississauga Ojibwas until the age of 14.  After that, he went to live with his father Augustus Jones, a Welsh-born United Empire Loyalist.  There he learnt the customs and language of the white Christian settlers of Upper Canada and was taught how to farm.  Jones converted to Methodism at age 21 after attending a camp-meeting with his half sister.  Methodist leaders in Upper Canada recognised his potential as a bridge between the white and Indian communities and recruited him as a preacher.  As a bilingual and bicultural preacher, he enabled the Methodists to make significant inroads with the Mississaugas and Iroquois of Upper Canada, both by translating hymns and biblical texts in Ojibwe and Mohawk and by preaching to Indians who did not understand English.  Beyond his preaching to the Indians of Upper Canada, he was an excellent fundraiser for the Canadian Methodists, and toured the United States and Great Britain giving sermons and speeches.  Jones drew audiences of thousands, filling many of the buildings he spoke in, but came to resent the role, believing the audiences came to see Kahkew\u0101quon\u0101by, the exotic Indian, not Peter Jones, the good Christian he had worked so hard to become.\nJones was also a political leader.  In 1825, he wrote to the Indian Department; his letter was the first the department had ever received from an Indian.  This brought him into contact with Superintendent of the Indian Department James Givins and influential Bishop John Strachan, with whom he arranged the funding and support of the Credit Mission.  There he lived and worked as a preacher and community leader, leading the conversion of Mississaugas to a European lifestyle of agriculture and Christianity, which enabled them to compete with the white settlers of Upper Canada.  He was elected a chief of the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission in 1829 and acted as a spokesman for the band when petitioning the colonial government and its departments.  During his British tours, he had audiences with King William IV and Queen Victoria, directly petitioning the latter on the issue of title deeds for the Mississaugas of Upper Canada.  During his life, Jones did manage to obtain some concessions from various provincial governments, such as having control over the trust funds for the Mississaugas of Credit turned over to their chiefs, but he was never able to secure title deeds for the Credit settlement.  In 1847, Jones led the band to relocate to New Credit on land donated by the Six Nations, who were able to furnish the Mississaugas with title deeds.  The Mississaugas of New Credit have since been able to retain title to the land, where they remain.  Jones' health had been declining for several years before the move to New Credit, and he was unable to accompany them to an unconstructed settlement, retiring to a nearby estate outside of Brantford, Canada West, where he died in the summer of 1856.", "link_mentions": {}}}
