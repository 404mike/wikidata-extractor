He was one of the few who survived the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) in 1917. The emotional scars of what he had witnessed as he tended the wounded and dying in Flanders were to remain with him for the rest of his life. It could well be that his wartime experiences led to his desire to live in idyllic surroundings and pursue the gentle art of fly fishing with such single-minded dedication.A History of Flyfishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Merlin Unwin Books (paperback edition 1994) page 120", "Bell was a bank angler and, as far as is recorded, he never fished from a boat. In its formative years Blagdon anglers would normally employ large sea trout or low water salmon flies during the daytime, very often using tandem and multi-hook arrangements; or alternatively lures at night. Dr Bell would use neither, but instead he preferred to fish with his own small imitative patterns.The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Robert Hale Ltd (1992)", "His flies were quite small, 10s, 12s, sometimes 14s. He might have a Worm Fly on a single hook on the point, a Grenadier on the middle dropper and a Buzzer on the top. All his dressings were plain and simple\".A History of Flyfishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Merlin Unwin Books (1992) chapter 15: Bell's Bugs"]}, {"page": "T C Ivens", "response": ["Ivens stressed the importance of long distance casting and favoured the use of slowly recovered \u2018deceiver\u2019 nymph fly patterns when the conditions allowed.The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark & Eric Restall, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) page 124 His original series of flies included five nymph patterns,Tying and Fishing the Nymph by Taff Price, Blandford a Cassell imprint (1995) page 193 the best known being his Black & Peacock SpiderFlydressing by David J Collyer, David & Charles (1973) pages 143-144 which is still in common use today.", "For those occasions when nymphs were not suitable (for example during strong winds when it is not possible to keep in touch with slowly-recovered flies) he used quickly-retrieved \u2018attractor\u2019 patternsA History of Flyfishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Merlin Unwin Books (paperback edition 1994) page 125 and his Jersey HerdFlydressing II by David J Collyer, David & Charles (1981) pages 209-211 fly is again still widely used.", "Tom Ivens' legacy is best summed up in the words of Conrad Voss Bark in The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing as follows: 'His aim was to put reservoir fishing on as scientific and simple a basis as possible, and his book and his whole philosophy had an instant appeal to large numbers of men who were being attracted to reservoir fishing for the first time since World War II, as well as those who had previously been fishing traditional wet flies without knowing quite why.'The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark & Eric Restall, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) page 124 Reservoir fly fishing has evolved considerably since then but the foundations laid in those early years are relevant today."]}]}}
