He spent almost his entire playing career at West Ham United and went on to manage the club between 1950 and 1961.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoff Hurst", "response": ["Hurst's football career began when he was apprenticed to West Ham United at the age of 15. Alongside Bobby Moore, both played in the 1959 FA Youth Cup final team that lost to Blackburn Rovers (1\u20132 on aggregate), but both were also in the team that won the  Southern Junior Floodlit Cup (1\u20130 v Chelsea) later that year. Manager Ted Fenton first selected him for a senior game in a Southern Floodlit Cup tie with Fulham in December 1958. He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid \u00a37 a week with a \u00a320 signing on fee. His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton's hand; Hurst put in an indifferent performance and the team lost 3\u20131. He made only two further appearances in the 1959\u201360 season, and realised that Bobby Moore was making better progress in the same position than he was. He played six times in the 1960\u201361 campaign and seriously considered turning his main focus to cricket. In April 1961 Ron Greenwood took over as manager, and drastically changed team training by putting a focus on footballing skill rather than physical fitness."]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["In 1932, the club was relegated to Division Two and long term custodian Syd King was sacked after serving the club in the role of manager for 32 years, and as a player from 1899 to 1903. Following relegation, King had mental health problems. He appeared drunk at a board meeting and soon after committed suicide. He was replaced with his assistant manager Charlie Paynter, who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games. The club spent most of the next 30 years in this division, first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player Ted Fenton.", "The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being \"The Academy of Football\", with the moniker adorning the ground's new stadium fa\u00e7ade. The comment predominantly refers to the club's youth development system which was established by manager Ted Fenton during the 1950s, that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks. Most notably, the club contributed three players to the World Cup-winning England side of 1966, including club icon Bobby Moore, as well as Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst who between them scored all of England's goals in the eventual 4\u20132 victory. Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included Trevor Brooking, Alvin Martin, Tony Cottee and Paul Ince.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Ted Fenton || style=\"text-align:center;\" | ||1950\u201361||484||193||107||184||39.87||  Division Two Champions 1957\u201358"]}, {"page": "West Ham", "response": ["*Ted Fenton, footballer and football manager"]}, {"page": "Southend United F.C.", "response": ["|1961\u20131965||Ted Fenton"]}, {"page": "Martin Peters", "response": ["Peters signed his first professional contract in November 1960. His first manager Ted Fenton left the club in 1961, to be replaced by Ron Greenwood. He was a major influence on Peters and his progress as a young footballer. In his first years with West Ham, Peters had played in both defensive and midfield positions before Fenton had encouraged him to play as a right-half. He made his debut on Good Friday 1962 in a 4\u20131 home win against Cardiff City. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 6\u20131 win at Manchester City on 8 September 1962. Also in 1962, Peters played in goal for West Ham in a game against Cardiff City after regular goalkeeper, Brian Rhodes had been injured."]}, {"page": "Ron Greenwood", "response": ["After retiring Greenwood moved into coaching. He coached Eastbourne United, Oxford University (where he came to the attention of Sir Harold Thompson, a future Chairman of The Football Association), and England youth teams. He combined the England under-23 post with being the assistant manager at Arsenal under George Swindin, having moved to Highbury in December 1957.

He played for North-East Essex Schools and Essex Army cadets before joining West Ham United in March 1950 from Colchester Casuals, his league debut coming two seasons later in a 2\u20131 away win against Coventry City. Bond had been spotted playing by West Ham assistant-manager Ted Fenton when he was manager with Colchester United. He had convinced manager Charlie Paynter to offer Bond a contract and Bond turned professional in March 1950.   His ability as a goal-scoring right-back soon resulted in him gaining a regular place in the Hammers side, his partnership with Noel Cantwell proving particularly useful. As West Ham won the Second Division title in 1957\u201358, Bond missed only one game, and scored eight goals. At this time he was also selected for the England 'A' side. A popular favourite of the fans at Upton Park, he was usually referred to as 'Muffin' because of his ability to kick like a mule. In 1959, he was tried as a centre forward, scoring twice in one game against Bolton Wanderers and a hat-trick against Chelsea in February 1960."]}, {"page": "John Lyall", "response": ["Watched by the club's manager, Ted Fenton, and chief scout Wally St Pier, Lyall was offered a place at West Ham United aged fifteen. In October 1955 he was taken on as a groundstaff boy, with duties such as boot cleaning, painting the football stands and wages clerk. He played youth team football as a left back. In February 1957 he won his only significant international honour when he played for England Youth in a 7\u20131 victory over Luxembourg at Upton Park.
