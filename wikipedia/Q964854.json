He was born in Renton, West Dunbartonshire.\nGalbraith began his career playing junior football at Vale of Leven and Shawfield before signing for Clapton Orient in 1921. He went on to spend a decade at the club, making 277 league appearances, before joining Cardiff City in February 1931. He was signed as a replacement for the club's FA Cup-winning captain Fred Keenor, but was unable to stop the club's slide as they fell into the Third Division South. He left the club in 1935 to manage Milford United, before later returning to Clapton Orient as a coach. Between 1936 and 1938, and for a short spell in 1939, Galbraith managed French side RC Lens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RC Lens", "response": ["* Jack Galbraith (1936\u201338)", "* Jack Galbraith (1939)"]}, {"page": "Galbraith", "response": ["* Jack Galbraith, former Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Fred Keenor", "response": ["The club entered a period of decline in the following years. Two seasons after their cup triumph and despite conceding the fewest goals in the division, Cardiff were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1928\u201329 season. An ageing Keenor became a target of frustrated fans as Cardiff suffered financial difficulties that saw the majority of the team's star names sold in a bid to raise funds. Replacements were signed from amateur sides, but the team struggled in the Second Division. Before the 1930\u201331 season Keenor was still on the wages he had received when the club was in the First Division. They gave him a twenty-five per cent pay cut during the season and a fifty per cent cut during the off-season. Club director Walter Bartley Wilson, who had intended to leave Keenor with no choice but to leave the club due to the severe drop in wages, instigated the cuts. Keenor told him, \"Bart, I'm going to surprise you too. I'm going to take it\". Despite this, he was eventually dropped from the team as they struggled for form and the club signed Jack Galbraith from Clapton Orient as a replacement. The side's form showed little improvement. Keenor played his final match for the club on 6 April 1931 against Tottenham Hotspur, along with the club's all-time record goalscorer Len Davies. They finished the season in 22nd position and were relegated to the Third Division South. Keenor was released at the end of the season, ending a 19-year spell with the side."]}, {"page": "Severnside derby", "response": ["|Jack Galbraith"]}, {"page": "John Galbraith", "response": ["* Jack Galbraith (1898\u2013?), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
