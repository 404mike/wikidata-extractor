He did note that a DM devoted to the setting would find the essays on the history of legends of Krynn and its races \"invaluable in recreating the atmosphere of the place\". He went on to say: \"Unfortunately, all this praiseworthy material - splendidly illustrated and presented though it is - has been lumped together with an odd-ball assortment of Dragonlance trivia.\"  Gallagher complained that with the \"so-called 'authentic'\" runic and numerological analyses of the Dragonlance heroes \"no attempts are made to explain how such occult charts are generated or interpreted!\" and that the section on herbalism included \"no suggestions as to how these might be incorporated into the campaign or what their effects in terms of game mechanics might be\". He concluded the review by saying: \"You may have guessed that I'm not one of the greatest Dragonlance fans, and maybe my lack of involvement in the series is the reason why I can't see the relevance (or even the interest) of much of this material. Be that as it may, there is no way I can recommend this book to anyone other than Dragonlance fanatics and completists."]}, {"page": "Hogshead Publishing", "response": ["In October 1994, James Wallis founded Hogshead Publishing, a company which specialised in role-playing and storytelling games.
