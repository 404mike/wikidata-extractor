He also scored on his return to Vale Park, perhaps with a point to prove after a Vale programme article described him as \"poor\" and his touch as \"frequently awful\". The 1999\u20132000 season was a poor one for Mills, scoring just six goals he was troubled with injury and had a falling out with manager Paul Jewell. He spent March 2000 on loan with First Division Manchester City. His poor form left him labelled as a \"forgotten man\" when he scored twice in the 2000 UEFA Intertoto Cup against Lithuanian side FK Atlantas. New manager Chris Hutchings put Mills on a list of seven \"underachievers\", with a warning that a continuation of poor form would see those players released. Hutchings' reign would last only a further four months. However, in that time Hutchings had sold Mills to Portsmouth for a club-record \u00a31.25 million, to make way for Ashley Ward.

Wilson further strengthened the squad by signing central defender Peter Markstedt. One of the highlights of the season was to follow as Barnsley gained a measure of revenge for their 7\u20130 defeat at Old Trafford. After being drawn against Manchester United in the FA Cup the team played admirably to secure a 1\u20131 draw. In the replay at Oakwell, two goals by Barnsley youth team graduate Scott Jones and a goal for John Hendrie were enough to dump Manchester United out of the FA Cup 3\u20132.

It was the return fixture at Oakwell however, which will be remembered for longer. After a good run of results for Barnsley, hopes were emerging that the team could avoid relegation. With the scores at 1\u20131 referee Gary Wilard sent off Barnsley players Darren Barnard and Chris Morgan. Liverpool then took the lead 2\u20131; the crowd was in a hostile mood yet not out of control. Then, for no apparent reason Wilard left the pitch without informing his assistants as to why. After a short break Wilard returned and Barnsley created an equaliser. In the last few seconds of the game Wilard sent off another Barnsley player, Darren Sheridan, and Liverpool scored a winner from the resulting free kick.", "With the team looking to bounce back to the Premier League John Hendrie was named manager. The Red's promotion hopes were hampered when they lost influential captain Neil Redfearn who was sold to Charlton Athletic after making 338 first team appearances for Barnsley. The season was mostly unremarkable as Barnsley finished 13th in the table. One of the highlights of the season was a 7\u20131 home victory against local rivals Huddersfield Town. This was the only time new signing Craig Hignett and Ashley Ward played together, with Ward leaving for Blackburn. After the season Barnsley lost yet more players from the promotion season, with solid defender Arjan de Zeeuw and attacking midfield player Clint Marcelle both leaving the club. Goalkeeper David Watson also suffered an injury mid-season that later ended his career.", "The first game of the season was an away visit to freshly relegated Bradford City, with the Reds suffering a humiliating 4\u20130 defeat, including goals by ex-Barnsley player Ashley Ward and former Sheffield Wednesday player Benito Carbone. This was to set a tone for Barnsley who did not pick up a victory away from home until they played bottom of the table Stockport County on Boxing Day. After a mediocre start with Barnsley reaching eleventh by mid-September results started to go downhill and the team found themselves hovering around the relegation zone."]}]}}
