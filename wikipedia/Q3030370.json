After serving his apprenticeship in Manchester, Wolff was employed as a draughtsman in Hyde, Greater Manchester, before being employed by the shipbuilder Edward Harland in Belfast as his personal assistant. In 1861, Wolff became a partner at Harland's firm, forming Harland and Wolff. Outside shipbuilding, Wolff served as a Belfast Harbour Commissioner.

Ismay established the company's headquarters at Albion House, Liverpool. Ismay was approached by Gustav Christian Schwabe, a prominent Liverpool merchant, and his nephew, the shipbuilder Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, during a game of billiards. Schwabe offered to finance the new line if Ismay had his ships built by Wolff's company, Harland and Wolff. Ismay agreed, and a partnership with Harland and Wolff was established. The shipbuilders received their first orders on 30 July 1869. The agreement was that Harland and Wolff would build the ships at cost plus a fixed percentage and would not build any vessels for White Star's rivals.

Born in Scarborough in the North Riding of Yorkshire, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy.  In 1846, aged 15, he took an apprenticeship at the engineering works of Robert Stephenson and Company in Newcastle upon Tyne.  Afterwards he was employed in jobs in Glasgow and again in Newcastle, before moving to Belfast in 1854 to manage Robert Hickson's shipyard at Queen's Island.  Four years later he bought the yard and renamed the business Edward James Harland and Company.  In 1861 he formed a business partnership with Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, his former personal assistant, creating Harland and Wolff.  Later, Harland recruited William James Pirrie as another partner.  Edward Harland, Gustav Wolff and William James Pirrie maintained a successful business, receiving regular orders from the White Star Line, before Harland's retirement in 1889, leaving Wolff and Pirrie to manage the shipyard.", "In December 1854, Harland moved to Belfast with Schwabe's encouragement, and was employed as manager of Robert Hickson's shipyard in Queen's Island. Here, Harland became known for strict management and improving workmanship, by cutting wages and banning smoking; he also carried a piece of chalk and an ivory ruler, used for marking mistakes. An employee at Harland's later venture, Harland and Wolff, stated:  Harland was able to keep the shipyard running despite the owner's financial problems. In 1857, Harland employed Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, Gustav Schwabe's nephew, as his personal assistant. Harland began attempting to open his own shipbuilding business, and was unsuccessful with several applications to open yards in Liverpool. But on 21 September 1858, Robert Hickson wrote to him: ", "Edward Harland's new company quickly attracted an order of three boats from John Bibby & Sons. These boats were named Venetian, Sicilian and Syrian; the current company's order book still has the three boats listed as No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. Impressed with the boats, Bibby ordered six more boats from Harland in 1860. The boats that Edward Harland designed were long, had a narrow beam and were flat-bottomed; the boats became known as \"Bibby's coffins\". On 26 January 1860, Harland married Rosa Matilda Wann, of Vermont, Belfast, who was the daughter of Thomas Wann, a stockbroker and insurance agent. In 1861, Harland chose the 27-year-old Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, his former personal assistant, to become a partner in the firm, forming Harland and Wolff. Harland's company had a prosperous relationship with Thomas Henry Ismay's White Star Line, a prominent shipping company, ensuring regular orders and financial success. Harland's designing skills created ships with flatter bottoms and squarer bilges to increase capacity. According to Edward Harland's obituary in The Times, he designed his company's ocean liners \"on the model of a fish swimming through the water.\" Harland's company received orders during the American Civil War from the Confederate States of America, who bought fast steamers to evade the Union blockade. In 1874 Edward Harland recruited William James Pirrie, a former apprentice at the company as a partner; Pirrie later became chairman of the company, and was given the task of finding buyers and negotiating deals. Harland was once asked the nature of the three men's business relationship and replied:  Harland applied for several patents including, in 1860 for \"improvements in constructing and covering the decks of ships and other floating bodies\", in 1871 for \"improvements in apparatus for propelling vessels\", in 1878 for \"improvements in screw-propellers.\" In 1880 Harland and his two partners decided to expand further and built their own engine works. Harland began having less involvement in the running of the shipyard, and in 1889 he retired from daily involvement in the business."]}, {"page": "Gustav Christian Schwabe", "response": ["In May 1842, Schwabe married Helen Dugdale, who was from the Wirral. Her father was John Dugdale, a businessman in Liverpool and Manchester. Schwabe then entered a partnership with his father-in-law, Benjamin Rutter, and Adam Sykes, forming the merchant company Sykes, Schwabe & Co. On 31 December 1853, the partnership was dissolved.  In the 1840s, Schwabe became a junior partner in John Bibby & Sons, a shipping company based in Liverpool. Around the same period, Schwabe met Edward Harland during Harland's apprenticeship in Newcastle upon Tyne at Robert Stephenson and Company. Schwabe arranged for Harland to be employed at the marine engineers J. & G. Thomson, who were building ships for John Bibby & Sons. Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, Schwabe's nephew, who would later go into partnership with Harland, left Hamburg in 1849 to live with Schwabe in Liverpool. In 1858, Schwabe financially assisted Edward Harland's purchase of Robert Hickson's shipyard at Queen's Island, Belfast. Schwabe, with Thomas Henry Ismay, purchased the bankrupt White Star Line in 1867. In 1869, during a game of billiards, Gustav Schwabe made a deal with Thomas Henry Ismay to finance the White Star Line, provided that the White Star Line would buy its ships from Harland and Wolff. Schwabe also convinced Ismay to compete with Cunard in North Atlantic passenger shipping. Schwabe also financially supported Albert Ballin, the managing director of the Hamburg America Line."]}, {"page": "Gustav Wolff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gustav Wilhelm Wolff"]}, {"page": "List of British people with German ancestry", "response": ["* Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, co-founder of shipbuilder Harland and Wolff, Conservative MP"]}, {"page": "1892 Belfast East by-election", "response": ["The Belfast East by-election of 1892 was held on 9 March 1892 after the incumbent Irish Unionist Party, Edward de Cobain, was expelled from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom after a criminal conviction.
