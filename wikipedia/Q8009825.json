At the same time, Birge Harrison was completing his painting \"The Return of the Mayflower\". It was to be awarded a medal at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition and, for its use of an opalescent tone particularly, is seen as a precursor of American Tonalism.", "The other tendency among the artists was to follow the Realism of such painters as Jules Bastien-Lepage and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet in their choice of humble everyday subjects \u2013 in the case of \u00c9taples, the life of the fisherfolk. There are good examples in the work of the American Louis Paul Dessar, who was in the town between 1886-1901, and the Anglo-Australian Tudor St George Tucker, whose first major painting, \"A Picardy Shrimp Fisher\", was executed in \u00c9taples. William Gerard Barry's \"Time Flies\" and Birge Harrison's \"The Return of the Mayflower\", mentioned above, are works of the same tendency.", "Among those painters known as Irish ImpressionistsJulian Campbell, The Irish Impressionists, The National Gallery of Ireland 1984 were the peripatetic William Gerard Barry and the short-lived Frank O'Meara, whose early visit to \u00c9taples has already been mentioned. Another of this group was Barry's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Harry Scully, who stopped in the town in 1896 but was identified with many other art colonies as well. Sarah Cecilia Harrison, noted for her paintings of children and landscapes, was there in 1890 and her \"On the road to \u00c9taples\" was exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy the following year.Campbell (1984), p.95 In 1898 Edith Somerville was painting in the town, companioned by her friend Violet Martin. In this case, though, they profited from their stay by conceiving together the stories gathered in Some Experiences of an Irish R. M. (1899). In the following decade Edward Millington Synge (1866-1913) passed some of the winter there and executed \"The Thaw, Etaples\" (1909), a watercolour of a muddy lane under trees with 'pale yellow sky, purple hills, dull red roof, grey and purple roadway, all obscured by patches of half melted snow\u2019. Also noted for etching, his print of a winter sunset also dates from this stay. The previous year he had married Freda Molony (1869-1924), whose name was mentioned at this period as among those painting in the town and as a successful exhibitor at the Royal Academy. Among her paintings was one of \"The Blessing of the Fishing Fleet\" at \u00c9taples (1906). Paintings of religious processions were comparatively rare in the colony, but in this case Molony's Impressionist approach, with its photographic cutting off of the action by the frame, can be compared with Iso Rae's Post Impressionist treatment of the \"Rogation Sunday\" procession some seven years later (Gallery 6).", "File:William Gerard Barry - An old woman and children in a cottage interior (1910).jpg|William Gerard Barry, An old woman and children in a cottage interior, 1887"]}, {"page": "List of Irish painters", "response": ["* William Gerard Barry (1864\u20131941)"]}]}}
