He took over 1,600 first-class wickets.\nA tall right-arm medium-fast seam bowler of great accuracy and consistency, Gladwin formed, with Les Jackson, the most feared new ball attack in the English first-class game for a dozen years after World War II. Gladwin was both penetrative and mean, with around a third of his overs being maidens, and in thirteen full seasons he took 100 or more wickets twelve times, usually at an average of under 20 runs per wicket.\nCricket writer, Colin Bateman noted that \"Gladwin was so proud of his miserly bowling, that he would correct the scorers at the close of play if there was an error in their figures\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 3", "response": ["*  1916   \u2013 Cliff Gladwin, English cricketer (d. 1988)"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["There have been more downs than ups in post-war years.

However, a series of seam bowlers served England as well as Derbyshire. The list began with Copson and continued with Cliff Gladwin, Les Jackson, Harold Rhodes, Alan Ward, Mike Hendrick and, most recently, Devon Malcolm and Dominic Cork. Spin was in short supply apart from the steady work of Edwin Smith and the under-rated all-rounder Geoff Miller, the current national selector of the England team and noted after-dinner speaker.

He scored 11 and a duck and did not take any catches behind the stumps. Thanks largely to recommendations by Cliff Gladwin, he went on to make his County Championship and Derbyshire debut on 7 June the follow year, scoring another duck and eight as well as taking two catches as Derbyshire drew with Sussex at the County Ground, Derby. His first victim was Sussex's Ken Suttle, yet several players observed that he had much to learn; many bowlers condemned him for standing up to the stumps and missing edges. Taylor would go on to play 17 matches in his debut 1961 season for his county, scoring 20 runs at 11.38 with a best of 48, taking 47 catches and 6 stumpings behind the wicket. 29 more games followed in 1960, however his batting remained unimpressive, scoring 300 runs at 10.71 with a best of 44. He remained dependable behind the stumps, with 77 catches and three stumpings. His 77 catches set a new Derbyshire-record.

He formed formidable bowling partnerships with Cliff Gladwin, and then with Harold Rhodes, both also England Test players. In the 1949 season, his second full season after joining Derbyshire, he took 120 wickets at a bowling average of 20.41. After a successful Test trial taking six fof 37, Jackson was selected in 1949 for the third Test against New Zealand at Old Trafford.Test no. 316: England v New Zealand at Old Trafford, 1949 He made his Test debut alongside Brian Close, opening the bowling with Trevor Bailey while the first choice fast bowler, Alec Bedser, was rested. Jackson met with some success, taking 2 for 47 and 1 for 25, but the match was drawn and he was replaced by Bedser for the fourth and deciding Test. He was not chosen to tour Australia in 1950\u201351, losing out to John Warr whose sole Test wicket came at a cost of 284 runs, but toured to India instead with a Commonwealth side, only to return home early with an elbow injury. Jackson played in another Test trial in 1950, but was unable to make much of an impression: on a soft wicket Jim Laker took 8 wickets for 2 runs, Bob Berry did the bulk of the bowling for \"The Rest\"England v The Rest in 1950 and Jackson's bowling was described as \"mediocre\"."]}, {"page": "List of England Test cricket records", "response": ["English bowler William Attewell, who played 10 Tests between 1884 and 1892, holds the Test record for the best career economy rate with 1.31.

He made his first-class debut for Derbyshire in the 1953 season when he played a single match against Oxford University, but began appearing regularly in the second eleven. Although his father played for the Derbyshire in 1953, they never played in the same first-class match. Rhodes was initially an off spin bowler. He played a single first-class fixture against Scotland in the 1954 season and played four first-class matches in the 1955 season. In the 1956 season he played four matches and took his first five wicket innings against Yorkshire. He played three matches in the 1957 season. He developed to become a fast seam bowler. In the 1958 season he played a full first-class season taking 67 wickets and two five wicket innings. He began opening the county bowling with Les Jackson in the 1959 season after the retirement of Cliff Gladwin. In that season, he played two Tests against India, taking nine wickets.

In the first Test, England recalled Eric Hollies and selected three debutants: Sam Cook, Tom Dollery and Jack Martin. Hutton, Washbrook, Edrich, Compton, Evans and Bedser were retained from the winter tour and these six with Yardley were the mainstays of the England team in 1947. There were changes again for the second Test with Charlie Barnett replacing Dollery, George Pope replacing Martin and Wright coming back in place of Cook. Bedser missed the third Test and was replaced by Cliff Gladwin while  Ken Cranston was brought in to replace Pope. In the fourth Test, Jack Young was introduced in place of Hollies and Harold Butler for Gladwin. Edrich missed the last Test, as again did Bedser, and there were yet more changes elsewhere with Dick Howorth coming in to replace Barnett and Bill Copson replacing Butler. Jack Robertson took Edrich's place. It all meant that, in a five-match series they won 3\u20130, England used 21 different players.", "Derbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392.", "Martin Donnelly dominated the Lord's match with \"a truly magnificent innings\", scoring 162 not out as the Gentlemen made 302 in the first innings, Bill Edrich scoring 79.

The Gentlemen slumped to 25 for five as wickets fell to Cliff Gladwin and Harold Butler but were rescued by Norman Yardley and Ken Cranston, rain ensuring that the result was a draw. The Gentlemen were led by England captain Norman Yardley and selected three Oxford University players \u2014 Donnelly, Tony Pawson and Tony Mallett \u2014 and two from Cambridge University: Guy Willatt and Trevor Bailey. The team included current England players Edrich and Cranston while Billy Griffith kept wicket. Reg Simpson made his first appearance in the fixture but could only score 4 and 0. The Players were captained by Les Ames who played as a batsman, Godfrey Evans keeping wicket. Washbrook opened with Jack Robertson, the other batsmen being Denis Compton, Charlie Barnett and Fletcher. The pace bowlers were Butler and Gladwin, supported by spinners Jack Walsh and Doug Wright.", "Tom Goddard had the best bowling analysis of the season when he took nine for 41 against Nottinghamshire at Bristol. His colleague Sam Cook was second-best with nine for 42 against Yorkshire, also at Bristol. Three other bowlers \u2014 Peter Smith, Len Muncer and Cliff Gladwin \u2014 took nine in an innings and there were twelve instances of eight in an innings, including three by Goddard. Goddard took fifteen wickets in a match three times but the best match analysis was sixteen for 215 by Peter Smith for Essex against Middlesex at Colchester.
