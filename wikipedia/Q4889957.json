A year later, he joined Football League Third Division North side Stalybridge Celtic on amateur terms, making one first-team appearance in the 1921\u201322 season. He was awarded a professional contract in March 1922 and played a further nine league matches in the following campaign. In August 1923, O'Beirne was signed on a free transfer by Football League First Division outfit Burnley. He made his debut for the club on 15 September 1923, replacing Albert Freeman, who had played in the previous two matches, in the goalless draw away at Nottingham Forest. He appeared in the next three league games, and scored his first competitive goal in the Lancashire Senior Cup tie against Manchester City on 15 October 1922. He then spent over four months out of the team, unable to oust regular inside-left Benny Cross. O'Beirne was reinstated to the starting line-up for the 2\u20132 draw with Manchester City on 16 February 1923, but subsequently returned to the reserves for the remainder of the season.Simpson, p. 165"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["Burnley's league campaign began on 28\u00a0August 1920 with a home match against Bradford City, who had finished 15th in the league in 1919\u201320. The season began inauspiciously for Burnley, beaten 1\u20134, but the match did see eventual top scorer Joe Anderson score the first of his 25\u00a0league goals of the campaign. Two further away defeats followed, 0\u20131 at Huddersfield Town and 0\u20132 at Bradford City, leaving Burnley at the bottom of the league table.Simpson (2007), p. 152 This run of defeats was Burnley's worst start to a league season since 1906\u201307, when they also lost their opening three matches.Simpson (2007), p. 14 Manager Haworth subsequently made several changes to the team; goalkeeper Jerry Dawson and defender Tommy Boyle were reinstated, while Bert Freeman and James Lindsay were dropped in favour of Billy Nesbitt and Benny Cross respectively. Burnley picked up their first win on 6\u00a0September 1920, beating Huddersfield Town 3\u20130 at Turf Moor; the goalscorers were Bob Kelly, Tommy Boyle, and Billy Nesbitt. They went on to defeat Middlesbrough 2\u20131 at home, and to draw with them 0\u20130 at Ayresome Park. On 25\u00a0September 1920, four players scored in a 4\u20130 victory against a weakened Chelsea team, giving Burnley their third successive home win.", "October began with a 1\u20131 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, after which the team recorded four straight wins throughout the remainder of the month. Burnley achieved home and away victories against Bradford (Park Avenue), before repeating the feat in the next two matches against Tottenham Hotspur. Burnley beat Tottenham 2\u20131 on 23 October 1920, then achieved a 2\u20130 victory the following week, the first time in the season that any team had been able to prevent Tottenham from scoring in a league match. The team's performance at White Hart Lane was met with disapproval from the correspondent from the Daily Mail, who wrote that Burnley set out to stifle their opponents and in doing so \"spoilt the match\". Burnley carried on their winning streak into November, with goals from Bob Kelly, Tommy Boyle and Benny Cross helping the side to defeat Newcastle United 3\u20131 at home and 2\u20131 away to lift them to second place in the league. The home fixture was marred by tragedy when a charabanc transporting supporters from Grassington overturned, killing five people. After the next game, a 2\u20132 draw with Oldham Athletic at Boundary Park on 20\u00a0November 1920, Burnley moved to the top of the table on goal average, 11\u00a0weeks after having been at the bottom. In the return match at Turf Moor a week later, Oldham were comfortably beaten 7\u20131; Bob Kelly scored four goals, and the others were added by Tommy Boyle and Benny Cross.", "A late Benny Cross goal gave Burnley a 1\u20130 win over Manchester United at Turf Moor, extending the team's unbeaten record to 30\u00a0matches. In the next match, Burnley lost a league fixture for the first time since 4 September 1920 when they were beaten 0\u20133 by Manchester City at Hyde Road. City were also challenging for the league title and eventually finished as runners-up. More than 37,000 spectators attended the match and several people were injured as the stadium became overcrowded. Burnley followed up the setback with successive wins over Manchester City and Manchester United to take the total number of league wins in the season to 23. The team suffered its fifth league defeat of the campaign on 9 April 1921, losing 0\u20132 away at West Bromwich Albion.", "Burnley played West Bromwich Albion again seven days later, drawing 1\u20131. The team went into the match against Everton on 23\u00a0April 1921 needing a draw to clinch the league championship. Everton took the lead 15\u00a0minutes into the game, but Benny Cross scored the equalising goal three minutes later, and Burnley held on to become English champions for the first time in their history. Local newspapers were effusive in their praise of the Burnley side, calling them \"the greatest team that ever was\". The draw with Everton was succeeded by another 1\u20131 stalemate against the same team at Turf Moor. In the penultimate game, Burnley were beaten 0\u20131 away at Sunderland, their sixth and final league defeat of the season. The campaign ended with a 2\u20132 draw against Sunderland on 7\u00a0May 1921 in front of a season-lowest crowd of 22,000. The draw took Burnley to a tally of 59 points, five points clear of second-placed Manchester City, and one short of West Bromwich Albion's then-record total of 60 points set in 1919\u201320.Lee & Whalley (2002), p. 42", "In April 1921, Burnley won the East Lancs Charity Cup for the second consecutive season, beating Blackburn Rovers 8\u20132 on aggregate over two legs. The first leg was won 6\u20132 at Turf Moor thanks to goals from Eddie Mosscrop, Joe Anderson, Benny Cross and a hat-trick from Bob Kelly, before strikes from Joe Anderson and James Lindsay gave Burnley a 2\u20130 win at Ewood Park. This success was followed by a 2\u20131 friendly victory over a Scottish Football League XI in a benefit match for Celtic winger Patsy Gallacher. Burnley also participated in the Lancashire Senior Cup; the league matches against Blackburn Rovers and Preston North End also counted as group stage matches in the competition. The team won all four of these games to qualify for the semi-finals, where they were drawn against Manchester City. The game on 9 May 1921 ended in a 0\u20132 defeat for Burnley, and their opponents went on to win the trophy that year.", "Burnley manager John Haworth used 23\u00a0different players during the 1920\u201321 season, and there were nine different goalscorers. The team played in a 2\u20133\u20135 formation throughout the campaign, with two fullbacks, three halfbacks, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre forward. Billy Watson played the highest number of games, appearing in all 45\u00a0First Division and FA Cup matches. Billy Nesbitt and Joe Anderson each played 43 times. Anderson was the top goalscorer for Burnley in the campaign with 31\u00a0competitive goals, including 25 in the league, the highest total since Bert Freeman's 36\u00a0goals in 1912\u201313.Simpson (2007), p. 129 With a tally of 23 goals, Bob Kelly was the second-highest scorer, followed by Benny Cross with 15, including the goal that won the title for Burnley. Club captain Tommy Boyle was the highest-scoring defender, with seven goals in 38\u00a0league appearances. Winger Billy Nesbitt scored five times during the season.", "|align=\"left\"|Benny Cross"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Cross (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Benny Cross (1898\u20131986), footballer"]}]}}
