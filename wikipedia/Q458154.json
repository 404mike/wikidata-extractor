He was a prototypical British gentleman scientist and inventor of the Victorian era.\nAmongst many accomplishments, he developed the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, and later applied its principles to a novel form of illumination, the Bude light; developed a series of early steam-powered road vehicles; and laid claim\u2014still discussed and disputed today\u2014to the blastpipe, a key component in the success of steam locomotives, engines, and other coal-fired systems.\nEvents surrounding the failure of his steam vehicle enterprise gave rise to controversy in his time, with considerable polarisation of opinion. His daughter Anna Jane Gurney (1816\u20131895) was devoted to him. During her lifetime, she engaged in a campaign to ensure the blastpipe was seen as his invention.", "link_mentions": {}}}
