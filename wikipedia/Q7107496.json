He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.  A tall, fair-haired right-arm fast-medium bowler, he came to prominence for Cambridge University in 1958 when he set the record for the most wickets in the university's abbreviated season with 80 first-class wickets for under 18 each. He played in the university holidays for Warwickshire with very limited success but in 1959 joined that county full-time, taking 100 wickets in the season though at a rather high cost. He repeated the feat in 1960, but at the end of the season was allowed to leave for Glamorgan, where he was appointed captain in place of Wilf Wooller, who had led the county since 1947. \nWheatley formed a hostile new ball partnership with the Test bowler Jeff Jones for a few seasons and in six years as captain took more than 600 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket. He retired from the captaincy at the end of the 1966 season, and played only a few matches in 1967. But in 1968 an early season injury to Jones meant that Wheatley returned to play in 16 County Championship matches, bowling with such success that he took 82 wickets at a cost of under 13 runs each and topped the national averages for the season. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1969 edition of the almanack.\nWheatley played only a few games in Glamorgan's Championship-winning season of 1969 and retired after one match on the celebratory tour of the West Indies the following winter. In all matches, he took 1,099 wickets at an average of under 21 runs per wicket. He was never allowed higher up the batting order than number ten (alternating in the last two places with Jones), and his career runs only just exceeded his wickets. In 1966 he went nine innings in a row without scoring. His highest score in purely county cricket was only 21, though in a festival match in 1961 for the Gentlemen he hit 34 not out and put on 55 for the tenth wicket with Trevor Bailey.In retirement, Wheatley remained prominent in cricket administration both at county and national level. He acted as a Test selector for England and chaired Test and County Cricket Board committees, as well as being president of Glamorgan. He was appointed CBE in the 1997 New Year Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ted Dexter", "response": ["In 1989 he succeeded Peter May as Chairman of the England Cricket Selectors, receiving a modest \u00a318,000 pay to compensate for his lost newspaper contract, the first chairman to be paid.Eager and Ross, p. 6 \"Dexter was soon in action, initially by way of press conferences and then, as the season developed, by lightning visits to the county grounds. These he made, despite an operation to a heel that put him for a while on crutches, by motorbike and car, a demonstration of enthusiasm and interest that was impressive.\" After the chaos of 1988 \u2013 the so-called Summer of Four Captains \u2013 he wanted the tough Mike Gatting as captain, but was vetoed by Ossie Wheatley and his status was immediately undermined. Instead the more relaxed David Gower was appointed for the six-Test series. Dexter tackled the role with energy and enthusiasm, but the shine soon wore off as Allan Border's 1989 Australians beat England 4\u20130 to regain the Ashes, their first series victory in England since 1975. His cause was not helped by the announcement of the Mike Gatting's rebel tour of South Africa in the middle of the series, which removed more than fifteen England players from contention.Eager and Ross, p. 81 Admittedly England were already 2\u20130 down in the series and none of these players had shown any talent so far in the summer, but it was an indication of the division and demoralisation of English cricket. In the First Test at Headingley Dexter selected four fast bowlers and no spinners for the team, advised Gower to put Australia in to bat, only to see them make 601/7 and win by 210 runs. For the Second Test he wrote an inspirational hymn for the England cricketers to sing called \"Onward Gower's Soldiers\" (to the tune of \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\") and appointed a team chaplain, but remained aloof from the players and seldom visited the dressing room. At the end of the summer he told the press that he couldn't think of any mistakes he had made and later joked that the \"lines of Venus were in the wrong juxtaposition\", which was incorrectly interpreted by the press as a genuine belief in New Age mysticism. The lackadaisical Gower was fired at the end of the summer and the more painstaking Graham Gooch was made captain until 1993, despite Dexter having called his previous appointment as captain as \"being hit in the face by a dead fish\"."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Ossie Wheatley"]}, {"page": "Shirley, West Midlands", "response": ["Ossie Wheatley, cricketer (Glamorgan and England), lived in Shirley in the 1950s while attending first Shirley College, a small private boys preparatory school at the end of Bills Lane Shirley, and then King Edward's School, Birmingham."]}, {"page": "Wheatley (surname)", "response": ["*Ossie Wheatley, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Trevor Ford", "response": ["In August 1968, at the age of 44, Ford, who had represented Wales at schoolboy level at cricket, briefly acted as a substitute fielder for Glamorgan in their County Championship match against Nottinghamshire at St. Helen's, Swansea in the match during which Sir Garfield Sobers hit his world record six sixes from an over bowled by Malcolm Nash. Holidaying in South Wales at the time and a spectator at the game, Ford volunteered to field for Glamorgan after Ossie Wheatley left the match due to injury during the lunch interval.

The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, he was very much a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than he might have done in other sides.
