The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, Champion Versions, they added Robin Jones (drums), John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards), and Steve Duffield (bass). While living in a flat in Shepherd's Bush they met Phil Brown, who after hearing their demo took it to Miles Leonard, who promptly signed the band. Duffield quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and quit the band. He later produced recordings under the name Lone Pigeon.

After they had signed to Regal Records, a subsidiary of EMI's label Parlophone, the three EPs were released together as the album The Three E.P.'s in September 1998, which similarly was met with positive reviews. In 1999, they signed to Astralwerks in the United States and the label subsequently released The Three E.P.'s in the country. According to writer Ted Hedrickson, the band \u2013 consisting of multi-instrumentalists Steve Mason, Robin Jones, Richard Greentree and John MacLean \u2013 fused musical elements like ambient drones, trip hop beats and Pink Floyd-style introspective balladry to create their unique sound throughout their EPs, and that these releases \"served as a fabulous taster for the band's self-titled debut.\"", "Each song on the album was approached differently; some songs the band developed from a single idea or melody, while the chords and melodies of others were developed beforehand. Robin Jones stated \"We never really had a master plan ... after we did a song, we turned around and tried to do exactly the opposite. The most exciting songs were the ones where we were making something out of nothing.\" Describing his lyrics for the record, vocalist Steve Mason explained he typically just followed \"the rhythms of the songs, more like a percussionist\", and mentioned that the songs \"don't really tell a story. It's just words that go in there. They mean something, but they don't mean\u2026anything.\" Despite some critics believing some of the tracks to be pastiches, the band explained to writer Lydia Vanderloo that they were not \"really into pastiche or irony or anything\", with Maclean commenting, \"Everything's very serious and honest, hopefully. We're not so scared that we hide behind the irony that a lot of folks seem to hide behind these days.\" Mason later explained to Hedrickson about the creation of the songs:", "According to Craig McLean of Spin, \"both sounded a little random, like a radio scanning across the ether\". However, the band ultimately decided to remove these tracks from the album. Jones recalled: \"We liked some of what we recorded, but it's not really what we wanted it to be from start to finish. We felt the second part was lacking in direction.\" Nonetheless, this decision came several weeks after the band's record label had already included the ambient disc with promotional copies of the album distributed to various people in the music industry. Drummer Robin Jones felt the reason they dropped the disc was because they were rushed into constructing it in only four days, saying they intended it to be \"an ambient\u2026 sound-piece. It\u2019s really indulgent on our part, but I wanted to make it a musical story. In the same way Chill Out by The KLF is a story. So it sort of succeeds. It just needed more\u2026 conclusions. Rushed again.\" The bonus disc was eventually released officially alongside special editions of the album's 2018 remaster.", "*Robin Jones \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "The Aliens (Scottish band)", "response": ["The Aliens are a Scottish band consisting of former Beta Band members Gordon Anderson (aka Lone Pigeon, lead vocals, guitar), John Maclean (keyboards, backing vocals) and Robin Jones (drums, backing vocals).
