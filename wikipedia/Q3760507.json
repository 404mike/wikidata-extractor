Sarll earned a commission and was gazetted a Lieutenant on 28 October 1901 reporting to the Border Scouts. The Scouts were known as 'The Bastards'. During one occasion with 'The Bastards', Sarll was tracking the Boers only to find that he was being tracked. In order to throw them off his trail, he rode randomly in the South African bush, getting lost in the process. Sarll only survived being lost for 8 days by finding a farm with occupants willing to care for him."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* G. F.
