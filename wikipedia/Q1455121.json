The pair recruited bassist Jason Viebrooks and vocalist Gus Chambers to complete the line-up. An early five-piece line-up briefly featured former Overkill guitarist Bobby Gustafson who claims to have come up with the name Grip which Lombardo expanded to Grip Inc. after Gustafson's departure in order to avoid a potential lawsuit. Grip Inc.'s debut record was released in 1995. The album, titled Power of Inner Strength, was distributed via California-based label Metal Blade Records. All-music reviewer Vincent Jeffries singled out Lombardo for praise on the album, saying Slayer fans would \"enjoy the drummer's double bass work and overall aggression throughout the disc.\" Sorychta claimed critics and music fans always spot mistakes in their music, because of Lombardo's popularity with Slayer\u2014they expect the band to sound like Slayer and complain.
