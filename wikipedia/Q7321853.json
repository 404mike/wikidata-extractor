He held positions of power on behalf of King Richard II of England, including two periods as the Sheriff of Anglesey in the 1370s and 80s. Rhys accompanied the king on a military expedition to Ireland in 1398, but in 1400 began to support the revolt of his cousin Owain Glynd\u0175r against King Henry IV of England. In 1401, he and his brother Gwilym ap Tudur took Conway Castle after infiltrating it, and liaised with Henry Percy prior to his own rebellion in 1403. After being outlawed by the king in 1406, Rhys was captured and executed at Chester in 1412, although later oral tradition claims he returned to Anglesey to die there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Owain Glynd\u0175r", "response": ["However, an alternative source states that Glynd\u0175r was under threat because he had written an angry letter to Lord Grey, boasting that lands had come into his possession, and he had stolen some of Lord Grey's horses, and believing Lord Grey had threatened to \"burn and slay\" within his lands, he threatened retaliation in the same manner. Lord Grey then denied making the initial threat to burn and slay, and replied that he would take the incriminating letter to Henry IV's council, and that Glynd\u0175r would hang for the admission of theft and treason contained within the letter. The deposed king, Richard II, had support in Wales, and in January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the English border city of Chester after the public execution of an officer of Richard II.These events led to Glynd\u0175r formally assuming his ancestral title of Prince of Powys on 16 September 1400 at his Glyndyfrdwy estate. With a small band of followers which included his eldest son, his brothers-in-law, and the Bishop of St Asaph in the town of Corwen, possibly in the church of SS Mael & Sulien, he launched an assault on Lord Grey's territories. After a number of initial confrontations between King Henry IV and Owain's followers in September and October 1400, the revolt, a prequel to the War of the Roses (Lancastrian and Tudor dispute) began to spread. Much of northern and central Wales went over to Glynd\u0175r. Henry IV appointed Henry Percy \u2013 the famous \"Hotspur\" \u2013 to bring the country to order. The King and English parliament on the 10th of March 1401 issued an amnesty in which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur, sons of Tudur ap Gronw (forefather of King Henry VII of England). Both the Tudurs were pardoned after their capture of Edward I's great castle at Conwy on May 28th 1401. In June, Glynd\u0175r scored his first major victory in the field at Mynydd Hyddgen on Pumlumon. Retaliation by Henry IV on the Strata Florida Abbey followed by October, but eventually led to Henry's retreat."]}, {"page": "Conwy Castle", "response": ["Henry Bolingbroke took the English throne to rule as Henry IV in 1400, but rebellion broke out in North Wales shortly afterwards under the leadership of Owain Glynd\u0175r. In March 1401, Rhys ap Tudur and his brother Gwilym, cousins of Owain Glynd\u0175r, undertook a surprise attack on Conwy Castle. Pretending to be carpenters repairing the castle, the two gained entry, killed the two watchmen on duty and took control of the fortress. Welsh rebels then attacked and captured the rest of the walled town. The brothers held out for around three months, before negotiating a surrender; as part of this agreement the pair were given a royal pardon by Henry."]}, {"page": "Penmynydd", "response": ["When Welsh nobleman Rhys ap Tudur was executed in 1412, lands of the Penmynydd family were forfeited. The village is notable for its early 17th century almshouses. The bwthyn at Minffordd was the first place on Anglesey used for Nonconformist worship in the early 18th century,.http://www.capeli.org.uk/uploads/newsletter_40.pdf  The village includes the Neuadd Lwyd, a former Victorian rectory that was converted into a country-house hotel. A radio communication transmission mast was installed in 2002 a few yards north of the village at the top of the hill."]}, {"page": "Battle of Bryn Glas", "response": ["After Glynd\u0175r gained early successes in 1400, King Henry led a punitive expedition into north Wales and appeared to have suppressed the revolt.Davies, p. 103 However, Glynd\u0175r remained at large, and anti-Welsh legislation by Parliament ensured that few Welshmen had reason to support continued English rule. On 1 April 1401 (which was Good Friday), two brothers from Anglesey, Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur, seized Conwy Castle by trickery. Glynd\u0175r himself won a victory over an army of English and Flemish settlers in Pembrokeshire at Mynydd Hyddgen in mid-Wales. These two events reinvigorated the rebellion. Henry led another punitive expedition into mid-Wales, but achieved nothing and his army suffered severely from bad weather."]}, {"page": "Glynd\u0175r Rising", "response": ["About the same time, the Tudur brothers from Anglesey launched a guerrilla war against the English. The Tudors of Penmynydd were a prominent Anglesey family who were closely associated with King Richard II. Gwilym ap Tudur and Rhys ap Tudur were both military leaders of a contingent of soldiers raised in 1396 to protect North Wales against any invasion by the French. They joined the king in his military expedition to Ireland in 1398. When Glynd\u0175r announced his revolt, Rhys, Gwilym and their third brother, Maredudd ap Tudur, openly swore allegiance; they were Glynd\u0175r's cousin on their mother's side.", "King Henry IV, on his way back from invading Scotland, turned his army towards Wales. By 26 September he was in Shrewsbury ready to invade Wales. In a lightning campaign, Henry led his army around North Wales. He was harassed constantly by bad weather and the attacks of Welsh guerrillas. When he arrived on Anglesey, he harried the island, burning villages and monasteries including the Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, Gwynedd. This was the historical burial place of the Tudor family. Rhys ap Tudur led an ambush of the king's forces at a place called Rhos Fawr ('the Great Moor'). After they were engaged, the Englishmen fled back to the safety of Beaumaris Castle. By 15 October, Henry was back in Shrewsbury where he released some prisoners and two days later at Worcester with little to show for his efforts.", "Owain remained free but now he was a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt continued to splutter on. In 1410, Owain readied his supporters for a last raid deep into Shropshire. Many of his most loyal commanders were present. It may have been a last desperate suicide raid. Whatever was intended, the raid went terribly wrong and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. Rhys Ddu (\"Black Rhys\") of Cardigan, one of Owain's most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: \"\u2026laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to Tyburn through the City and was there hanged and let down again. His head was smitten off and his body quartered and sent to four towns and his head set on London Bridge.\" Philip Scudamore and Rhys ap Tudur were also beheaded and their heads displayed at Shrewsbury and Chester (no doubt to discourage any further thoughts of rebellion)."]}, {"page": "Maredudd ap Tudur", "response": ["Maredudd ap Tudur (died c. 1406) was a Welsh soldier and nobleman from the Tudor family of Penmynydd. He was one of five sons of Tudur ap Goronwy, and was the father of Owen Tudor.

Tudur had served with the forces of King Edward III of England during the campaigns in France in 1337, assuming the rank of knight in the process. Afterwards, he became a royal officer for the island of Angelsey and ensured that all of his sons found similar roles.

However, following that king's overthrow, Rhys, Gwilym and another brother, Maredudd ap Tudur, gave their allegiance to the rebel Owain Glynd\u0175r, a nephew of one of their father's wives and descendant of the earlier native Welsh princes.  Rhys was executed in 1412 at Chester, and following Glynd\u0175r's demise much of the family's lands were taken by the English crown. The majority were then regranted to another branch of Ednyfed Fychan's lineage, the Griffiths of Penrhyn, whose head, Gwilym ap Griffith, had married Goronwy's daughter, Morfydd."]}, {"page": "Tudur ap Goronwy", "response": [":Rhys ap Tudur (by Mallt)", ":Rhys ap Tudur (by Marged)"]}, {"page": "Gwilym ap Tudur", "response": ["Gwilym ap Tudur (died 1413) was a Welsh nobleman and a member of the Tudor family of Penmynydd.

He remarried in 1405, to Joan, a daughter of Sir William Stanley from Hooton, Cheshire. This was withdrawn by November 1407, when his forfeited lands were restored to him by the King.
