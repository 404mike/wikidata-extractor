Di Canio however continued to be a provider of goals as well, notably in October 2003 when he came on as second-half substitute with Charlton trailing 0\u20131 away at Portsmouth.

Norwich City, Southampton, Crystal Palace, and West Bromwich Albion were all separated by just two points going into the final match. It was the first time since the establishment of the Premier League in 1992 that no team was assured of relegation going into the final matchday and the closest dogfight in the top flight since 1927\u201328, when 11 teams were separated by only two points going into the final matchday, in an era when a win was worth two points instead of today's three. Even worse, only one team survived the drop. West Brom (who started the day bottom) needed to beat Portsmouth at The Hawthorns and they won 2\u20130 thanks to goals from Geoff Horsfield and Kieran Richardson meaning Baggies fans were having to nervously wait for other results. Norwich, who started in pole position, were thumped 6\u20130 at Fulham and were relegated after a dreadful display. Southampton meanwhile hosted Manchester United and looked like staying up after a John O'Shea own goal but the Irishman set up Darren Fletcher to equalize before Ruud van Nistelrooy headed home to send them down. In the other game, Crystal Palace traveled to local rivals Charlton Athletic and after Bryan Hughes gave them a half time lead, Dougie Freedman equalized within two minutes of coming on as a substitute before winning a penalty which top scorer Andy Johnson scored meaning the Eagles looked like staying up but Jerome Thomas's free kick was headed home by Jonathan Fortune, the game finished 2\u20132, relegating them. That meant West Brom became the first team to be bottom at Christmas and stay up, this resulted in the Baggies fans invading The Hawthorns pitch, Portsmouth fans joined in as their local rivals Southampton were relegated, Albion also stayed up with the lowest ever points tally in the Premier League for a surviving team with 34."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["| Jonathan Fortune"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["In the January transfer window, Stoke signed Lee Martin, Dominic Matteo, Gabriel Zakuani and Jonathan Fortune whilst captain Michael Duberry left for Reading leaving Higginbotham to take over as club captain.

Charlton started the brightest when, from an early corner, Jonathan Fortune headed towards goal via a deflection, forcing a good save from Shaka Hislop. Then it was Portsmouth's turn when Yakubu crossed in to the Charlton box. Dean Kiely dropped the cross to Eyal Berkovic, who took too long to get a shot out. There was a quiet period in the game until Danny Murphy got a cross in which Kevin Lisbie managed to head onto the bar. Then Lisbie turned supplier, leading to Charlton's first goal. Lisbie crossed in and Portsmouth failed to clear, allowing Jason Euell to stab the ball past Hislop. Portsmouth then almost equalised soon afterwards with another cross. This one was from Yakubu, who crossed in for Patrik Berger. He took a shot which was blocked into the path of David Unsworth who in turn shot into the side netting. Kiely preserved Charlton's lead, denying Yakubu and Berger as Charlton went in 1\u20130 at half time. Charlton threatened at the start of the second half with efforts from Dennis Rommedahl and Shaun Bartlett but then Portsmouth got an unbelievable equaliser. A short free kick was given to Patrik Berger, who flicked up and volleyed incredibly from approximately 35 yards out, seeing the ball fly into the top corner. Charlton were looking good after that goal and were looking to get a late goal. Rommedahl and Bartlett were both denied by Shaka Hislop, who was having a good game until the 87th minute when Jonathan Fortune swung in a free kick which glanced off David Unsworth's head. Hislop failed to gather the ball as Charlton grabbed a late winner."]}, {"page": "List of English football transfers winter 2006\u201307", "response": ["| Jonathan Fortune ||  || Charlton Athletic || Stoke City || Five-month loan"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["| Jonathan Fortune"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Football League Two", "response": ["|Jonathan Fortune"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["| Jonathan Fortune"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["|Jonathan Fortune", "| Jonathan Fortune", "| Jonathan Fortune"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Jonathan Fortune"]}]}}
