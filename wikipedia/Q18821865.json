Later in 1875, Alexander M\u00fcller during quality assessment of water from wells in Berlin noted that ammonium was stable in sterilized solutions but nitrified in natural waters. A. M\u00fcller put forward, that nitrification is thus performed by microorganisms. In 1877, Jean-Jacques Schloesing and Achille M\u00fcntz, two French agricultural chemists working in Paris, proved that nitrification is indeed microbially mediated process by the experiments with liquid sewage and artificial soil matrix (sterilized sand with powered chalk). Their findings were confirmed soon (in 1878) by Robert Warington who was investigating nitrification ability of garden soil at the Rothamsted experimental station in Harpenden in England. R. Warington made also the first observation that nitrification is a two-step process in 1879 which was confirmed by John Munro in 1886. Although at that time, it was believed that two-step nitrification is separated into different life phases or character traits of a single microorganism."]}, {"page": "Katherine Warington", "response": ["Katherine Warington was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire on 5 September 1897, a twin and one of the five daughters of Helen Louisa Makins and the agricultural chemist Robert Warington FRS [Jnr].Goddard, N.
