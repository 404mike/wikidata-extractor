Her most notable research is in understanding the evolution of recombination, sex chromosomes and mating system for plants.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Selfish genetic element", "response": ["To model the dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) within a genome, one has to realize that the elements behave like a population within each genome, and they can jump from one haploid genome to another by horizontal transfer. The mathematics has to describe the rates and dependencies of these transfer events. It was observed early on that the rate of jumping of many TEs varies with copy number, and so the first models simply used an empirical function for the rate of transposition. This had the advantage that it could be measured by experiments in the lab, but it left open the question of why the rate differs among elements and differs with copy number. Stan Sawyer and Daniel L. Hartl fitted models of this sort to a variety of bacterial TEs, and obtained quite good fits between copy number and transmission rate and the population-wide incidence of the TEs. TEs in higher organisms, like Drosophila, have a very different dynamics because of sex, and Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth, Charles Langley, John Brookfield and others modeled TE copy number evolution in Drosophila and other species. What is impressive about all these modeling efforts is how well they fitted empirical data, given that this was decades before discovery of the fact that the host fly has a powerful defense mechanism in the form of piRNAs. Incorporation of host defense along with TE dynamics into evolutionary models of TE regulation is still in its infancy."]}, {"page": "European Society for Evolutionary Biology", "response": ["* 2001\u20132003 : Deborah Charlesworth"]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 100 || Evolution || Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth ||    (2nd ed.) || || science"]}, {"page": "List of popular science books on evolution", "response": ["* Brian Charlesworth and Deborah Charlesworth (2003).
