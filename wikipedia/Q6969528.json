Sidebottom died in February 1871 causing a by-election. Initially the local Liberal Party selected the Honourable Edward Lyuth Stanley as their candidate, but following a number of delegations of \"working men\", Buckley was chosen. The by-election was held on 28 February and Buckley won the seat by 208 votes.By the 1870s Buckley was a millionaire and in 1873 he purchased the Galtee estate of the Earl of Kingston, near Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ireland. Following a revaluation, he issued rent demands to his new tenants of between fifty and five hundred percent. This led to a great deal of agrarian unrest, evictions and an attempted assassination of Buckley's land agent. His actions also demonstrated weaknesses in the Irish Land Acts which were consequently amended.Buckley was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire in 1867.At the 1874 general election Buckley was defeated by the Conservative candidate, Thomas Harrop Sidebottom. He did not return to parliament.\nAt the time of his death, aged 71, in 1892 he had residences at Alderdale Lodge, Droylsden, Lancashire and Galtee Castle, County Cork.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stalybridge (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Nathaniel Buckley"]}, {"page": "Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway", "response": ["In 1856, a deputation, including the Mayors of Oldham (John Platt) and Ashton-under-Lyne (Nathaniel Buckley), approached the MS&LR to support a line from Guide Bridge which would connect to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) at Oldham."]}, {"page": "Abel Buckley", "response": ["The Buckley family owned two cotton mills in Ashton: Ryecroft and Oxford Road, and Abel became involved in the business.
