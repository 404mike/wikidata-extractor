His first season at the club was spent in the reserves and Davies became disillusioned with the coaching process at the club, claiming \"I couldn't see myself learning anything because I had no one to learn from\". However, Davies later met former Wolves goalkeeper Bert Williams in his shop and Williams offered to help train Davies in his spare time, the pair having training sessions at Wolves' Castlecroft training ground. He had to wait five years before making his debut on 27 January 1962 in an FA Cup tie against rivals West Brom. He managed 12 appearances during this season, and made the position his own in the 1962\u201363 campaign, replacing Malcolm Finlayson."]}]}}
