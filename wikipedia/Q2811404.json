Macdonald was best known for a series of books on the First World War that draw on first hand accounts of surviving veterans.  \nMacdonald lived near Cambridge, England, and worked as a BBC radio producer until 1973, when she began working on a documentary with the Old Comrades Association of the 13th (Service) Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, who were visiting the battlefields of the Western Front. The first of her influential books took its title, They Called It Passchendaele, from a poem by Siegfried Sassoon. Other works included Somme. In 1988, she led a party of veterans to the Western Front, accompanied by Sebastian Faulks, who was inspired by the experience to write his novel Birdsong.Macdonald bequeathed an archive of about 600 recordings of interviews of veteran of the First World War to the Imperial War Museum.", "link_mentions": []}}
