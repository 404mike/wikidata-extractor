After an unsuccessful stint in Formula Ford he landed a drive in his friend Stephen Choularton's team in Formula Atlantic, after showing great promise in a couple of Formula Libre races at Croft. He went on to spend a number of years driving alongside Choularton at SDC Racing in Formula Atlantic and was spotted by Lotus Cars and offered a test drive by them.\nHe participated in two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 19 July 1975. He was also the winner of the 1982 British Formula One Championship. He is notable for being the 500th person to start a Formula One World Championship race.\nCrawford moved to the United States in the early 1980s, finishing runner-up twice in the Can-Am series. He finished fourth on his CART debut at Long Beach in 1984 and went on to become a regular in the Indianapolis 500. It was there in 1987 that Crawford suffered a crash in practice which resulted in serious leg injuries. However, he recovered sufficiently to return to the 500 in 1988, leading the race for a few laps. A late race puncture dropped him from 2nd to 6th.\nCrawford's final 500 was in 1993, although he made unsuccessful attempts to qualify old cars in 1994 and 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Crawford", "response": ["* Jim Crawford (American football) (1935\u20132018), American football player for the Boston Patriots", "* Jim Crawford (baseball) (born 1950), former baseball player", "* Jim Crawford (footballer) (born 1973), Irish footballer", "* Jim Crawford (racing driver) (1948\u20132002), Scottish auto racing driver", "* Jim Crawford (runner), American track athlete and medalist in athletics at the 1971 Pan American Games"]}, {"page": "1975 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Jim Crawford", "|  Jim Crawford"]}, {"page": "1975 Italian Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Jim Crawford", "|  Jim Crawford"]}, {"page": "1975 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Jim Crawford", "|align=\"left\"|  Jim Crawford"]}, {"page": "Roberto Guerrero", "response": ["For 1992 Guerrero drove in a pair of races for the part-time team King Racing, first driving the No. 26 Quaker State Lola T91/00-Buick V6 at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on the Streets of Long Beach, starting 14th and finishing 13th.
