It is typical of this part of the coast, having originally been a very small village which became a much larger settlement during the 1930s. Many of homes from this era were converted railway carriages: very few of these remain, although a few similar ones still exist in nearby Dungeness. Dymchurch is now a popular seaside resort complete with holiday camp, caravan parks, light railway station and amusement park. Today the village is relatively large and mainly dedicated to seasonal tourism."]}, {"page": "Jerrold", "response": ["*Walter Jerrold (1865\u20131929), English writer and journalist"]}, {"page": "Blackie and Son", "response": ["* Walter Jerrold"]}, {"page": "The Song of the Shirt", "response": ["* Walter Jerrold, Thomas Hood: His Life and Times (London: Alston Rivers, 1907)"]}, {"page": "Ernest William Haslehust", "response": ["*Walter Jerrold"]}, {"page": "Robert Maynard Leonard", "response": ["*A Century of Parody and Imitation, ed. with Walter Jerrold (H.
