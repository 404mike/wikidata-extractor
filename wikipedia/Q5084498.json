The work soon paid off when Curran scored two goals in his first four league games, against Hartlepool United on 16 August 2008 and Northampton Town on 30 August 2008. However, Curran suffered a groin injury, stomach muscle injury and back strain that kept him out for months. After making his return from injury in a reserve match against Bury on 14 March 2009, Curran made his first team return three days later, coming on as a substitute for Charlie Barnett in the 68th minute, in a 1\u20130 loss against Cheltenham Town. Having returned to the side Curran was hopeful that he could help the club achieve a play-off place. In the last game of the season, he scored his third goal of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Scunthorpe United, however the result saw the club miss out on the play-offs. Curran ended his 2008\u201309 season, making sixteen appearances and scoring three times."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["||| Charlie Barnett|| Tranmere Rovers||Released||Summer"]}, {"page": "John Paul Kissock", "response": ["Born in Fazakerley, Liverpool, Kissock played for youth side Key Ways from the age of six and joined the academy of Premier League club Everton, his favourite team, a year later.
