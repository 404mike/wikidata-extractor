After his playing days, he became a prominent cricket administrator, acting as secretary at Surrey County Cricket Club and being joint manager, with Pelham Warner, of the English cricket team in Australia in 1932-33 which became embroiled in the Bodyline controversy.\nAs a cricket player, Palairet was overshadowed by his brother, Lionel, who played for the same two first-class sides and was regarded as one of the stylish batsmen of the 1890s and the early 1900s. Their father, Henry Palairet, played first-class cricket twice for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1868 and 1869.\nRichard Palairet's first-class record indicates that he was a useful right-handed batsman, but probably no more than useful: as a schoolboy at Repton he had been more successful than Lionel, but a soccer injury at Oxford restricted his movement and his fluency. He often opened the innings, though less frequently for Somerset, where his brother was ensconced at No 1, than for Oxford.\nIn 112 first-class matches, he made exactly 4,000 runs at an average of 21 runs per innings; he scored only two centuries in a career that lasted 12 years. His highest was 156 against Sussex at the County Ground, Taunton in 1896 when he put on 249 for the second wicket with his brother, who made 154. In the winter of 1896\u201397 he was a member of a touring team to the West Indies led by Arthur Priestley; a second touring side to the West Indies that winter was led by Lord Hawke. After that tour, his appearances in first-class cricket became less frequent.\nPalairet played his last first-class match in 1902, but came back into the game as secretary of Surrey from 1920 to 1932. He stood down from that post to become joint manager on the Bodyline tour. He was president of Somerset County Cricket Club from 1937 to 1946.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grange-over-Sands", "response": ["* Richard Palairet, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["In Jardine's obituary, Wisden described this tour as \"probably the most controversial tour in history. England won four of the five Tests, but it was the methods they employed rather than the results which caused so much discussion and acrimony.\" On the journey to Australia, by the boat Orontes, Jardine kept away from his team. He issued some instructions on their conduct, such as giving autographs or keeping out of the sun. He also began to have disagreements with Plum Warner, who was one of the two team managers along with Richard Palairet.Frith, pp. 61\u201364. He discussed tactics with Harold Larwood and other bowlers, spoke to Hedley Verity about his role in the team, and he may have met batsmen Wally Hammond and Herbert Sutcliffe. Some players reported that Jardine told them to hate the Australians in order to defeat them, while instructing them to refer to Bradman as \"the little bastard.\"Frith, pp. 61, 66.

G. Grace. He played for Arthur Shrewsbury's England XI against Australia in 1893, and scored 71 runs as the English side won by an innings and 153 runs. He scored five half-centuries for Somerset that summer, and his batting average of 28.94 in the County Championship was bettered only by Hewett among his teammates. The next year, Palairet made a big score against his former university. Facing a team that included his brother, Richard Palairet, and was captained by Fry, he made 181 runs in Somerset's second innings, the highest first-class score of his career to that point. He also scored a century against Nottinghamshire, making 119 runs before being out leg before wicket to his old trainer Attewell. He fell just short of 1,000 first-class runs in 1894; though two half-centuries scored against the touring South Africans in matches not considered first-class would have taken him over the milestone."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1932\u201333", "response": ["The MCC team was captained by Douglas Jardine, with Bob Wyatt as vice-captain.

He failed to make a first-class half-century all season, the 47 scored in Somerset's innings and 170 run victory over Gloucestershire being his top-score. His attacking style lent itself to quick scoring, but not always to making big totals. Of his 114 in the Varsity match, Wisden says that he hit with \"a power which was absolutely amazing\". In From Sammy to Jimmy: The Official History of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes his intent \"to hit every ball as far as he could\". During his time at Winchester, Hill had been used as a bowler, but was rarely used at Somerset. In 1894 against Nottinghamshire, he was brought on as the seventh change bowler, only wicket-keeper Leslie Gay and fellow opener Richard Palairet unused. In his 1.4 overs, Hill claimed three wickets for the expense of only a single run."]}, {"page": "John Challen", "response": ["The subsequent 1890 season was a successful one for Somerset; they were unbeaten in their thirteen county matches, winning twelve and tying the other. Challen was fourth in Somerset's batting averages, achieving his highest score of the season, 67, against Leicestershire. Later in the season, he also scored 49 of the 107 runs that Somerset managed during their tied match against Middlesex; his innings was described as \"far and away the best innings of the side.\" Somerset's strong performance in 1890 saw them readmitted to first-class cricket in 1891, whereupon they joined the County Championship, a competition which had only been instituted the previous year. Challen, playing in a first-class match for the first time in over five years, only managed six runs against Middlesex in May that season, though Cricket magazine described the wicket as \"not in favour of the batsmen\" due to heavy rain. In Somerset's first win of 1891, Challen made modest scores of 41 and 18 not out, but he was praised for his steady play, both in a partnership with Lionel Palairet on the first day, and with his brother Richard Palairet towards the end of the game. Challen was praised later in the season for his resilient batting in difficult conditions against Lancashire's spin bowling duo of Johnny Briggs and Arthur Mold, though he could not prevent his side from losing. He scored his highest total of the season in mid-August against Surrey, playing \"sound cricket with plenty of hit tempered by excellent defence\" to score 89 runs in the second innings and help Somerset to victory. In the next match, he took advantage of difficult bowling conditions to score 79 runs against Gloucestershire during another win for Somerset.

During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said he did not want to speak to the Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge.", "In 1932\u201333 the English team, led by Douglas Jardine and jointly managed by Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet, toured Australia and won the Ashes in an acrimonious contest that became known as the Bodyline series. The English team used contentious bowling tactics where the English pace bowlers Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the ball roughly on the line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched, designed to rise at the batsman's body, with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat. Intended to be intimidating, the tactics proved difficult for batsmen to counter and were physically threatening.Douglas, p. 103. The primary target of Bodyline was Donald Bradman, who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Leading English cricketers and administrators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932\u201333, and looked for possible weaknesses in his batting technique.Frith, pp. 37\u201339."]}, {"page": "Michael Palairet", "response": ["Charles Palairet was descended from a Huguenot family called Palayret who had fled initially to the Netherlands, later to England, when Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1689.Neville, P.
