It was last seen by naturalist John Charles Melliss in 1872. William Roxburgh recorded it in the thick forests on the south face of Diana's Peak. De Candolle notes it in dense woods around Diana's Peak and Halley's Mount. Burchell notes it 'On Sandy Bay ridge near Taylor's. Flowering: probably August to March. It was exceedingly rare in Meliss's time, it is not in his book as he had not found it. It was probably the increase of Phormium tenax planting on the ridge that pushed Wahlenbergia roxburghii into final extinction. It is an example of one of the early extinctions of Saint Helena plants as a result of human activity, with a history similar to that of the stringwood (Acalypha rubrinervis), (see List of extinct plants)."]}, {"page": "Mellissia", "response": ["Mellissia was formerly a monotypic genus in the family Solanaceae with the single species, Mellissia begoniifolia (Saint Helena boxwood), , endemic to the island of Saint Helena.
