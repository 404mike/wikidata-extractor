The Sargant Report (1905) was important for the future of education in the Transvaal.\nSargant founded and funded a shortlived school in Hackney, London, called 'School Field'. Its purpose was to demonstrate that children could be given a better education if their teachers were not bound by a narrow curriculum and were not required to focus on success in attainment tests in order to ensure school funding.\nHe was also a poet, appearing in particular in the first of the Georgian Poetry anthologies.", "link_mentions": {}}}
