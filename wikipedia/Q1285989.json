The Sargant Report (1905) was important for the future of education in the Transvaal.\nSargant founded and funded a shortlived school in Hackney, London, called 'School Field'. Its purpose was to demonstrate that children could be given a better education if their teachers were not bound by a narrow curriculum and were not required to focus on success in attainment tests in order to ensure school funding.\nHe was also a poet, appearing in particular in the first of the Georgian Poetry anthologies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Georgian Poetry", "response": ["Lascelles Abercrombie - Gordon Bottomley - Rupert Brooke - G.

On 17 June 1903 Ware was made a member of the Transvaal Legislative Council, and in July he became permanent director of education for the Transvaal. Author  wrote that as a member of the council Ware was \"probably the only South African Superintendent of Education that has represented education directly before the legislature\". Under Ware, the number of children in education in the Transvaal doubled in less than four years. As director, he advocated the eventual creation of a de-centralised system of education with responsibility largely in the hands of local authorities."]}, {"page": "Sargant", "response": ["*Edmund Beale Sargant (1855\u20131935), British colonial administrator"]}]}}
