Joyce won the British Ladies Amateur four times (1922, 1924, 1925, and 1929) and the English Ladies' champion for five consecutive years (1920\u201324).\nShe married Sir John Heathcoat-Amory in 1937, and became Lady Heathcoat-Amory. Her play and swing were greatly admired by Bobby Jones, the American champion of the same era. Jones, who played several exhibition rounds with her, had a very high regard for her game. She essentially retired from competitive play by 1930.\nShe played most of her golf at (and was a member of) Worplesdon Golf Club in Surrey. She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1975.\nAn exhibition of memorabilia can be seen at Knightshayes Court in Devon, where she lived.", "link_mentions": {}}}
