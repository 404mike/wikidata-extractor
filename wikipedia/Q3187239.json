Joyce won the British Ladies Amateur four times (1922, 1924, 1925, and 1929) and the English Ladies' Amateur Championship for five consecutive years (1920\u201324).\nShe married Sir John Heathcoat-Amory in 1937, and became Lady Heathcoat-Amory. Her play and swing were greatly admired by Bobby Jones, the American champion of the same era. Jones, who played several exhibition rounds with her, had a very high regard for her game. She essentially retired from competitive play by 1930.\nShe played most of her golf at (and was a member of) Worplesdon Golf Club in Surrey. She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1975.\nAn exhibition of memorabilia can be seen at Knightshayes Court in Devon, where she lived.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joyce (name)", "response": ["*Joyce Wethered (1901\u20131997), British golfer"]}, {"page": "World Golf Hall of Fame", "response": ["*1975  Joyce Wethered"]}, {"page": "Timeline of golf history (1851\u20131945)", "response": ["Joyce Wethered wins her record fifth consecutive  English Ladies' Championship."]}, {"page": "Curtis Cup", "response": ["|\u00a0Marion Hollins\u00a0Joyce Wethered"]}, {"page": "Memorial Tournament", "response": ["| 2004 ||  Ernie Els || align=center|270 || align=center|\u221218||4 strokes ||  Fred Couples ||align=right|945,000||Lee TrevinoJoyce Wethered"]}, {"page": "Knightshayes Court", "response": ["Sir John Heathcoat-Amory, 3rd Baronet, grandson of the 1st Baronet, married Joyce Wethered, the golfer.

The first post World War I championship was played at Royal County Down in May 1920. Cecil Leitch, the defending champion from 1914, met Molly Griffiths in the final. Leitch was 6 holes up after the morning round and won 7&6. Joyce Wethered made her first appearance at Turnberry in 1921 and she and Leitch would dominate the event in the 1920s, the two meeting in the final in 1921, 1922 and 1925. They had met in the final of the 1920 English Women's Amateur Championship, with Wethered winning, but in the 1921 Womens Amateur Championship, the result was reversed. Leitch was 8 up with 9 holes to play and, although Wethered then won four holes in a row, Leitch won the match 4&3. When the pair met again in 1922 at Royal St George's, the morning round was close, with Wethered a hole ahead. However she then dominated in the afternoon, eventually winning 9&7. In 1923 Leitch was injured and Wethered was surprisingly beaten in the semi-finals, leaving a final between Doris Chambers and Muriel Macbeth. In the final Macbeth was 3 up after the morning round but Chambers won the match at the 36th hole. In 1924, at Royal Portrush, Wethered and Leitch met in quarter-finals. Wethered won 6&4 and went on to win her second title. At Troon in 1925, Wethered and Leitch met in the final for the third time. The match was level after 18 holes and still level after 27.

Joyce Wethered did not enter and Cecil Leitch won, the first woman to win the event four times. A large number of the original entrants scratched and the final was played a day earlier than usual, on a Thursday. Simone de la Chaume won the championship in 1927, the first French woman to do so. She had been a semi-finalist in 1926 and was also the first French winner of the Girls Amateur Championship, in 1924. There was another French winner in 1928 when Manette le Blan won the title. The 1929 championship was played on the Old Course at St Andrews. Wethered came out of retirement to play and met the American, Glenna Collett, in the final. Collett had already won the U.S. Women's Amateur three times. The final created great public interest. After 9 holes Collett led by 5 but her lead was reduced to 2 after the morning round. Wethered then won 7 of the first 9 holes in the afternoon to be 4 up and eventually won 3&1, her fourth win in the championship. Collett reached the final again at Formby in 1930 and met Diana Fishwick in the final. Fishwick was competing in the event for the first time although she had won the Girls Amateur Championship in 1927 and 1928.
