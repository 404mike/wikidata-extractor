Their calculations of the melting points of hydrogen, argon and mercury led them to conclude that the results provided evidence for a zero-point energy. Moreover, they suggested correctly, as was later verified by Simon (1934), that this quantity was responsible for the difficulty in solidifying helium even at absolute zero. In 1924 Robert Mulliken provided direct evidence for the zero-point energy of molecular vibrations by comparing the band spectrum of 10BO and 11BO: the isotopic difference in the transition frequencies between the ground vibrational states of two different electronic levels would vanish if there were no zero-point energy, in contrast to the observed spectra. Then just a year later in 1925, with the development of matrix mechanics in Werner Heisenberg's famous article \"Quantum theoretical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations\" the zero-point energy was derived from quantum mechanics."]}, {"page": "Human capital flight", "response": ["Many Jews escaping from German-occupied Europe to the United Kingdom established successful careers in publishing, medicine, science, psychoanalysis, and other occupations.

As a result, the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort. Four universities provided the locations where the experiments were taking place. The University of Birmingham undertook theoretical work, such as determining what size of critical mass was needed for an explosion. This group was run by Peierls, with the help of fellow German refugee scientist Klaus Fuchs. The laboratories at the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford experimented with different types of isotope separation. Chadwick's group at Liverpool dealt with thermal diffusion, a phenomenon observed in mixtures of mobile particles where the different particle types exhibit different responses to the force of a temperature gradient. Francis Simon's group at Oxford investigated the gaseous diffusion, which works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238. This was determined to be the most promising method. Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather's group at Cambridge investigated whether another element, now called plutonium, could be used as a fissile material. Because of the presence of a team of refugee French scientists led by Hans von Halban, Oxford also had the world's main supply of heavy water, which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power."]}, {"page": "Frank Spedding", "response": ["In 1934, Spedding was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, allowing him to study in Europe.

During these trials Lindemann tried to recruit Mendelssohn to join him in Oxford University. However as Mendelssohn had just accepted a job in Breslau, he felt obliged to refuse. He was joining his cousin, Franci Simon, who had appointed Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Breslau. Nevertheless Lindemann contacted him again in 1932 inviting him to the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford to install a helium liquifier. This he did, and by the time he returned to Breslau in January 1933, he had a grant application to the Rockefeller Foundation to allow him to join the Clarendon Laboratory.

Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass. After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) was determined to be the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process. Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6."]}, {"page": "Simon (surname)", "response": ["* Francis Simon (born Franz Eugen Simon) (1893\u20131956), German/British physical chemist"]}, {"page": "Hans Kronberger (physicist)", "response": ["In 1944 he moved to Birmingham University, joining  Francis Simon's team in the Tube Alloys Project, the British programme to develop an atomic bomb."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Sir Francis SimonEncyclopedia Judaica, 14:1578"]}, {"page": "Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Simon\"|Sir Francis Simon"]}, {"page": "Brebis Bleaney", "response": ["Physics.
