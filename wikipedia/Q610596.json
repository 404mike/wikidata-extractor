His main contribution to human knowledge was developing the theory that linked rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to global temperature. He was the first to demonstrate that the Earth\u2019s land temperature had increased over the previous 50 years in 1938. This theory, earlier proposed by Svante Arrhenius, has been called the Callendar effect.  Callendar thought this warming would be beneficial, delaying a \"return of the deadly glaciers.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
