His main contribution to human knowledge was developing the theory that linked rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to global temperature. He was the first to demonstrate that the Earth\u2019s land temperature had increased over the previous 50 years in 1938. This theory, earlier proposed by Svante Arrhenius, has been called the Callendar effect.

Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling  to be around 5\u20146\u00a0\u00b0C. Other scientists were initially sceptical and believed the greenhouse effect to be saturated so that adding more  would make no difference.
