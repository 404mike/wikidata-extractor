He was an assistant tithe commissioner between 1836 and 1847, writing over 200 articles for the Justice of the Peace between 1838 and 1842. In 1838 and 1839 he published a pair of treatises on the Tithe Acts, which were expanded, bound and published in 1848 as The Tithe Act and the Whole of the Tithe Amendment Acts.\nIn 1846 he married Anne Wakeford, with whom he had a son and two daughters. During the Great Famine in 1847 he established several fisheries on the Irish west coast.

It was claimed he encouraged Kent to confess, and that he convinced her to surrender to the police.  He repeatedly denied this, although he stated that he did not discourage Kent from going to the police after she told him she would.  At her insistence, Wagner spoke to the Home Secretary Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet and chief magistrate Sir Thomas Henry, to whom Kent gave a written confession.  When the case was heard in May 1865, Wagner was cross-examined; his refusal to state what Constance Kent had said to him during her confession resulted in an \"outburst of ultra-Protestant fury\".  Public disquiet at the use of Catholic-style ritual at St Paul's Church turned to national outrage when it was established that confession was heard.  Physical and verbal attacks on Wagner occurred regularly, and Wagner's home and the St Mary's Home for Penitents were put under police guard.  Anti-Catholic Liberal politician George Hammond Whalley falsely claimed in the House of Commons that Wagner had \"got rid of\" a young resident of St Mary's Home who had left money to the Home in her will\u2014she was in fact an inmate of a home elsewhere in Sussex, and Wagner had only met her briefly\u2014and the Central Protestant Association (an anti-High Church organisation) called for the Mayor of Brighton to bring before Parliament a statement condemning the \"base and degrading confessional practices carried on ... by traitors\" within the Church of England.  A meeting they held in Brighton descended into violence.  Later in May 1865, Wagner was assaulted in the street; and on another occasion he was shot at by an unknown assailant but suffered no injury.  Only after national newspapers such as The Times and The Morning Post ran articles condemning the ultra-Protestant disturbances in Brighton did the furor die down."]}]}}
