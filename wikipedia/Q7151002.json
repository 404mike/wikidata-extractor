From 1970 to 1971, Paul Greening served as her Commanding Officer. In 1972, during the Second Cod War, Aurora came to the aid of an Icelandic fishing vessel that had caught fire, rescuing its crew in the process. Soon after this incident, Aurora underwent modernisation which included the addition of the Ikara anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missile launcher that in effect changed the Batch One ships, of which Aurora was part, into a specialised ASW batch rather than its original role as a general-purpose batch. The modernisation was completed in 1976."]}, {"page": "Master of the Household", "response": ["*Rear-Admiral Sir Paul Greening,  1986\u20131992"]}, {"page": "1928 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 June \u2013 Paul Greening, naval officer and courtier (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "2008 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 5 November \u2013 Sir Paul Greening, naval officer and courtier (born 1928)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2008", "response": ["*Sir Paul Greening, 80, British admiral and courtier."]}, {"page": "Naval Secretary", "response": ["* 1978 \u2013 1980 Rear-Admiral Paul Greening"]}, {"page": "Greening (surname)", "response": ["* Paul Greening (1928\u20132008), British courtier"]}, {"page": "Paul Wollven Greening", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Greening"]}, {"page": "Greening, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Greening"]}]}}
