New Bedford released him after fourteen games and the New York Nationals had him play for one game.  He then spent time with an amateur team in the New York area.  In March 1930, Toner joined Bethlehem Steel.  Bethlehem withdrew from the league during the 1930 summer break and Tollan joined the New York Giants for the second half of the 1930 season as well as the 1931 season.  He was part of one of the most improbable comebacks as the Giants took the 1931 League Cup after losing the first game, 8-3, to the Whalers.  Tollan scored the second Giants goal in that game. Frank Tollan followed and supported Glasgow Celtic his entire life. Although raised in Hamilton his love of  the pure and passionate football that Celtic provided instantly made an impact on his and his entire family and friends life. He was noted as saying \"Football without the fans is nothing\" .", "link_mentions": []}}
