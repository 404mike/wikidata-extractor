His first season began brightly for the club, as they looked like promotion contenders capable of at least a play-off place, but a terrible loss of form in the second half of the season almost resulted in them suffering relegation to Division Three.\n1993\u201394 saw Hartlepool finally relegated to Division Three, and at the end of the campaign new manager David McCreery decided that Wratten was no longer part of the clubs plans and gave him a free transfer. A brief spell at York City followed, but Wratten was released without making a first-team appearance and by the age of 24 his professional career was over, although he continued to play football at non-league level with Bishop Auckland in the Northern Premier League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1990\u201391 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Paul Wratten"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Paul Wratten"]}, {"page": "Wratten", "response": ["*Paul Wratten (born 1970), retired English footballer who played as a midfielder"]}, {"page": "Wratten, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Wratten"]}]}}
