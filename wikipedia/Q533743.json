On 7 October 2008, Allen joined Conference Premier club Wrexham on a one-month loan and scored a goal from 25\u00a0yards on his debut for the North Wales team the same day, in a 3\u20131 win over York City at the Racecourse Ground. His loan was curtailed after only one more match, when he damaged ankle ligaments and was sidelined for a month. Allen returned from the injury in December, entering the Swansea squad at home to Barnsley after regular midfielder Ferrie Bodde had been ruled out for the remainder of the season due to injury. With Swansea 2\u20130 down and playing poorly, manager Mart\u00ednez was prompted to bring Allen on from the substitutes' bench. The club went on to earn a late 2\u20132 draw and despite only playing 25 minutes, Allen once more received the man of the match award. On 5 April 2009, Allen came on as a 68th-minute substitute for Mark Gower, and 20 minutes later scored his first goal for Swansea in a South Wales derby 2\u20132 draw away at Cardiff City. At the end of the season, he signed a new three-year contract lasting until 2012."]}, {"page": "Ysgol Tryfan", "response": ["* Owain Tudur Jones - footballer."]}, {"page": "Coleg Menai", "response": ["* Owain Tudur Jones, footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Hibernian F.C. players", "response": ["*Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Jones", "response": ["*Owain Tudur Jones (born 1984), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "2011 Nations Cup", "response": ["|CM ||4 ||Owain Tudur Jones || || ", "|MF ||16||Owain Tudur Jones || || "]}, {"page": "Tudur", "response": ["* Owain Tudur Jones (born 1984), Welsh international footballer"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Norwich City F.C. season", "response": ["|Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Swansea City A.F.C. season", "response": ["*16 June: Norwich City signed midfielder Owain Tudur Jones on a three-year deal for a sum thought to be in the region of \u00a3250,000."]}, {"page": "Owain Tudur Jones/old version", "response": ["#redirect Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "Owain Tudur-Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Norwich City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|30||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Owain Tudur Jones", "|Owain Tudur Jones", "|Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2006 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|CM ||23 ||Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["* 27 August:Welsh midfielders Owain Tudur Jones and Shaun MacDonald sign on loan from Norwich City and Swansea City respectively.", "| Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Owain Tudur Jones", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Owain Tudur Jones", "| Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["| 4|||| DF|| Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Owain Tudur Jones"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Scottish Premier League", "response": ["**Owain Tudur Jones (Inverness CT)"]}]}}
