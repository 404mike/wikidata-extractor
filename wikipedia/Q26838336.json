She always suspected Captain Peacock of cheating on her and all her on-screen appearances were during periods of marital discord. In Mrs Peacock's first appearance (\"Oh What A Tangled Web\"), she suspected Captain Peacock of having an affair with Mr Rumbold's secretary, Miss Hazelwood, because her brother had seen them in a car together, although he was later cleared. In her second appearance (\"A Personal Problem\"), because Captain Peacock had accidentally put his hands down Miss Pickthorpe's cleavage to retrieve some spilt blancmange and semolina pudding at a party (the department Miss Pickthorpe works for was never specified, and the semolina pudding turned out to be Mr Harrowgate and Miss Fawcett the year before. Like Miss Pickthorpe, their department was never found out). Mrs Peacock became Mr Rumbold's secretary, and she pretended that she was having an affair with him to make Captain Peacock jealous. In her third appearance (\"The Sweet Smell of Success\"), Mrs Peacock burst into Mr Rumbold's office because she suspected Captain Peacock of flirting with Mr Rumbold's new secretary, Miss Belfridge. In her fourth appearance (\"Grounds For Divorce\"), Captain Peacock chose to stay with her rather than a bank/accounts clerk who had become infatuated with him. In her fifth appearance (\"Friends And Neighbours\"), Mrs Peacock came to the Grace Brothers houses to check up on her husband (like Mrs Rumbold), but she left satisfied (unlike Mrs Rumbold). Captain Peacock once mentioned that she had many brothers and sisters (\"His And Hers\" and \"The Think Tank\"). By the time of Grace and Favour, Mrs Peacock seems to be either dead or divorced from Captain Peacock as she is neither seen nor mentioned.", "* Diana Lambert (\"Fifty Years On\", as the Six-Pound Fox Customer); also appeared as Mrs. Peacock in two episodes, died 1994\u20135"]}, {"page": "The Vicious Circle (1957 film)", "response": ["* Diana Lambert - Latimer's Office Nurse"]}, {"page": "Crane (TV series)", "response": ["4.
