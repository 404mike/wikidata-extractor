In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844\u20131924) published a paper describing the first successful elective human tracheotomy to be performed for the purpose of administration of general anesthesia.

He was also the first physiologist to make an audacious (if scientifically incorrect) transposition of cortical maps obtained in monkeys to the human brain. This proposal soon led to practical consequences in  neurology and neurosurgery. A Scottish surgeon, Sir William Macewen (1848\u20131924), and two British physicians, the clinical neurologist, Hughes Bennett, and Rickman J. Godlee demonstrated in 1884, that it was possible to use a precise clinical examination to determine the possible site of a tumor or lesion in the brain, by observing its effects on the side and extension of alterations in motor and sensory functions. This method of functional neurological mapping is still used today. Jackson and Ferrier were present at the first operation performed by Godlee on 25 November 1884.
