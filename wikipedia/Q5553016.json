Neil Fox, Harold Poynton, Gerry Round, Derek 'Rocky' Turner and Jack Wilkinson, were unable to accompany the team on the six-match tour, as they were in Australia with the GB tourists. Wakefield Trinity's Chairman Stuart Hadfield was also touring with the national team as Great Britain manager. Trinity therefore added four South African players who were playing for British clubs at that time to their squad. They were Fred Griffiths (Wigan), Tom van Vollenhoven (St. Helens), Wilf Rosenberg (Hull F.C.) and Edward \"Ted\" Brophy (Leigh). Wakefield had three South Africans of their own in the squad in Alan Skene, Jan Prinsloo and Colin Greenwood, with the rest of the party made up of Fred Smith, Ken Hirst, Ken Rollin, Keith Holliday, Dennis Williamson, Milan Kosanovi\u0107, Geoff Oakes, Brian Briggs, Albert Firth and Don Vines. It was some squad so, not surprisingly; they were comfortable winners of all six matches. The tour opened on Saturday 30 June 1962 at Milner Park, Johannesburg, where the local Johannesburg Celtic club were overpowered by 52\u20136.", "#Gerry Round"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Northern Rugby Football League season", "response": ["|1|| Gerry Round"]}, {"page": "Derek Turner", "response": ["Alongside fellow Wakefield Trinity players, Neil Fox, Harold Poynton, Gerry Round, and Jack Wilkinson, Turner was selected for the Great Britain squad to play in 1962 tour of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
