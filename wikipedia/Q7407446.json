Following a brief sojourn to appear a further time for Altrincham in the 2\u20130 home victory over Welling United on 19 December 1992, he managed to displace Bowling from the Lincoln side over the Christmas fixtures and a series of impressive displays saw him rewarded with a new two-year contract in March 1993. He began the 1993\u20131994 season as the Imps first-choice goalkeeper before briefly losing his place to John Burridge over the Christmas and New Year fixtures and permanently following the signing of Andy Leaning in March 1994.
