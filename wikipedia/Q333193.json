Elected as MP for Doncaster in 1951, Barber held various posts in government under Harold Macmillan, including Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Minister of Health. After losing his seat in 1964, he won the 1965 by-election in Altrincham and Sale and returned to Parliament.\nBarber was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Edward Heath in 1970, and oversaw a major liberalisation of the banking system, replaced purchase tax and Selective Employment Tax with Value Added Tax, and also relaxed exchange controls. During his term the economy suffered due to stagflation and industrial unrest, including a miners strike which led to the Three-Day Week. In 1972 he delivered a budget which was designed to return the Conservatives to power in an election expected in 1974 or 1975. This budget led to a period known as \"The Barber Boom\". The measures in the budget led to high inflation and wage demands from public sector workers. He was forced to introduce anti-inflation measures, along with a Price Commission and a Pay Board. After the Conservatives lost the first election in 1974, he did not stand in the second election of that year. Barber became Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank until 1987 and died in 2005.", "link_mentions": {}}}
