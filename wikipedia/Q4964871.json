Before going to Monash he taught one year in Paris (1970\u201371) and several years at the University of Wales Aberystwyth (1973\u201386). In 1986, he became professor at Monash and retired in 2008. Nelson taught modern French literature and cultural history, and literary translation.In addition to a number of monographs including Zola and the Bourgeoisie and \u00c9mile Zola: A Selective Analytical Bibliography, he has made a number of modern translations of \u00c9mile Zola for the Oxford World's Classics series. Speaking about his translation of The Belly of Paris, Nelson said:\n\nMy aim as a translator is to transform Zola's prose into a work of art that approaches the original, that is, is faithful to the spirit of the original. This means capturing the structure and rhythms, the tone and texture, and the lexical choices --in sum, the particular idiom-- of Zola's novel, as well as preserving the \"feel\" of the social context out of which the novel emerged and which it represents.Nelson was formerly the editor of the Australian Journal of French Studies (2002-2020), co-founded the journal Romance Studies, edited the monograph series Monash Romance Studies, and is a former President of AALITRA (the Australian Association for Literary Translation).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "In Search of Lost Time", "response": ["#Swann in Love by Brian Nelson"]}, {"page": "La Fortune des Rougon", "response": ["The first English translation by Henry Vizetelly was published in 1886 and extensively revised (to meet Victorian standards of propriety and avoid prosecution for issuing an indecent publication) by Ernest Vizetelly in 1898, issued under the title The Fortune of the Rougons by Chatto & Windus. It is of reasonably poor quality, not helped by Vizetelly's boast that he had changed one in every three sentences in the course of his editing.
