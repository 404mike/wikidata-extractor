Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for revolutionising the genre of landscape painting with his pictures of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his home \u2013 now known as \"Constable Country\" \u2013 which he invested with an intensity of affection. \"I should paint my own places best\", he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, \"painting is but another word for feeling\".Constable's most famous paintings include Wivenhoe Park (1816), Dedham Vale (1821) and The Hay Wain (1821). Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, he was never financially successful. He became a member of the establishment after he was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 52. His work was embraced in France, where he sold more than in his native England and inspired the Barbizon school.", "link_mentions": {}}}
