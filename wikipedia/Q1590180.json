In the original, there were a total of 93 separate compositions; however only 64 remain either complete or in part.  Some of the 24 composers are known only because of their inclusion in the Eton Choirbook.  John Browne has the most compositions (10), followed by Richard Davy (9) and Walter Lambe (8).", "Stylistically, the music contained in the Eton Choirbook shows three phases in the development of early Renaissance polyphony in England.  The first phase is represented by the music of Richard Hygons, William Horwood and Gilbert Banester.  Most of the music of this early phase is polyphonic but non-imitative, with contrast achieved by alternation of full five-voice texture with sections sung by fewer voices.  The second phase, which includes music by John Browne, Richard Davy and Walter Lambe, uses imitation, cantus firmus techniques, and frequent cross-relations (a feature which was to become a distinctive sound in early Tudor polyphony).  The final phase represented in the choirbook includes music by William Cornysh and Robert Fayrfax, composed around 1500.  Points of imitation are frequent, cantus firmus techniques disappear, and in general the sound of the music is more Continental.", "* 4.  f. 10-11: Gaude flore virginali - Richard Davy", "* 18.  f. 32v-34: Salve regina mater misericordiae - Richard Davy", "* 30.  f. 56v-59: O Domine caeli terraeque creator - Richard Davy", "* 31.  f. 59v-62: Salve Jesu mater vera - Richard Davy", "* 32.  f. 62v-65: Stabat mater dolorosa - Richard Davy", "* 33.  f. 65v-68: Virgo templum trinitatis - Richard Davy", "* 34.  f. 68v-71: In honore summae matris - Richard Davy", "* 69.  missing: Magnificat: Et exultavit spiritus meus - Richard Davy", "* 90.  f. 121: Magnificat: Et exultavit spiritus meus - Richard Davy", "* 92.  f. 124-126: Passio Domini - Richard Davy", "The composers represented in the manuscript are: John Browne (10 works), Richard Davy (9), Walter Lambe (8), Robert Wilkinson (7), William Cornysh (5), William Horwood (4), Robert Fayrfax (2), John Fawkyner (2), Nicholas Huchyn (2), Hugh Kellyk (2), Edmund Turges (2), Gilbert Banester, Brygeman (1), Robert Hacomplaynt (1), John Hampton (1), Holynborne (1), Richard Hygons (1), Nesbet (1), Edmund Sturton (1), John Sutton (1), Sygar (1) and William Stratford (1).", "* Richard Davy: Passion According To St. Matthew.
