Whilst at Grimsby he scored the winning golden goal in the 1998 Football League Trophy final. He also briefly played Premier League football for Blackburn Rovers and also played in the Football League for Leyton Orient, Bolton Wanderers and Peterborough United as well as playing non-League football for Woking, Grays Athletic and Fisher Athletic.

In the summer of 1997, Buckley succeeded in bringing in players to the club who were to be instrumental in the club's upcoming season; former skipper Paul Groves was re-signed from West Bromwich Albion, and Kevin Donovan and David Smith also joined the club from Albion. The mid-season capture of Huddersfield Town midfielder Wayne Burnett proved to be a great bit of business for Buckley.

The Mariners went on to dump Burnley out of the Football League Trophy Northern section area final, which would see the club book its first trip to Wembley Stadium. The club were drawn against Southern section champions AFC Bournemouth and in a tight game, an equaliser from substitute Kingsley Black took the game into extra time, and in the 112th minute Grimsby secured the game courtesy of a golden goal from Wayne Burnett.

It took only four weeks for Grimsby to return to the stadium though, this time to face Northampton Town in the Division Two play-off Final.
