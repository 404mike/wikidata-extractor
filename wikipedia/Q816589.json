The first notable suggestion came from Kyle Sullivan of Lumberton, Mississippi, USA, whose mnemonic was published in the Jan. 2007 issue of Astronomy magazine: \"My Violent Evil Monster Just Scared Us Nuts\". In August 2006, for the eight planets recognized under the new definition, Phyllis Lugger, professor of astronomy at Indiana University suggested the following modification to the common mnemonic for the nine planets: \"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos\". She proposed this mnemonic to Owen Gingerich, Chair of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Planet Definition Committee and published the mnemonic in the American Astronomical Society Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy Bulletin Board on August 25, 2006. It also appeared in Indiana University's IU News Room Star Trak on August 30, 2006. This mnemonic is used by the IAU on their website for the public. Others angry at the IAU's decision to \"demote\" Pluto composed sarcastic mnemonics in protest. Schott's Miscellany by Ben Schott included the mnemonic, \"Many Very Educated Men Justify Stealing Unique Ninth\". Mike Brown, who discovered Eris, mentioned hearing \"Many Very Educated Men Just Screwed Up Nature\". One particular 9 planet mnemonic, \"My very easy memory jingle seems useful naming planets\", was easily changed once the demotion occurred, becoming the 8 planet mnemonic, \"My very easy memory jingle seems useless now\". Slightly risque versions include, \"Mary's 'Virgin' Explanation Made Joseph Suspect Upstairs Neighbor\" And perhaps simplest of all: \"My Very Easy Method: Just SUN\"."]}, {"page": "Schott\u2019s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Schott#Schott's Miscellanies"]}, {"page": "Schott's Miscellanies", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Schott#Schott's Miscellanies"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science, University of Cambridge", "response": ["*Ben Schott, writer and photographer"]}, {"page": "Price tag attack policy", "response": ["The price tag attack policy (), also sometimes referred to as \"mutual responsibility\" (),Amos N.
