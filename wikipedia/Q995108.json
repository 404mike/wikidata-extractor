The movement developed in the United Kingdom and North America in the 19th century around the teachings of John Thomas, who coined the name Christadelphian\"The Christadelphians, or brethren in Christ ... The very name 'Christadelphian' was coined by the founder of the movement, John Thomas, at the time of the American Civil War principally to provide a distinctive nomenclature for the use of the civil authorities [...] At the time of the American Civil War, Thomas coined a name for his followers: Christadelphian \u2013 brethren in Christ. The exigencies of the situation in which the civil authorities had sought to impress men into the armed forces had accelerated the tendency for those religious bodies objecting to military service to become more definite in their teaching and conditions of membership.\" Bryan R. Wilson, Sects and Society (London: William Heinemann, 1961), p. 219, 238\"Christadelphians (or Brethren in Christ) ... Congress had exempted from war service the members of any religious body which was conscientiously opposed to bearing arms.

He once wrote in a letter, \"I did not know a better denomination that would be given to such a class of believers, than Brethren in Christ.

In 1864, he began to publish The Ambassador of the Coming Age magazine. John Thomas, out of concern that someone else might start a publication and call it The Christadelphian, urged Robert Roberts to change the name of his magazine to The Christadelphian,Bryan R.

Wilson is a writer on secularization who is interested in the nature of life in a society dominated by scientific knowledge. His work is in the tradition of Max Weber, who saw modern societies as places in which rationality dominates life and thought. Weber saw rationality as concerned with identifying causes and working out technical efficiency, with a focus on how things work and with calculating how they can be made to work more effectively, rather than why they are as they are. According to Weber, such rational worlds are disenchanted. Existential questions about the mysteries of human existence, about who we are and why we are here, have become less and less significant."]}, {"page": "Apostasy", "response": ["Bryan R.

Ikeda occasionally contributes editorials to major newspapers, which also print reports on Gakkai business. Since the Komeito Party joined the ruling government coalition in 1999, widespread criticism by the media of the Soka Gakkai has abated and the Soka Gakkai is gaining acceptance as part of the Japanese mainstream.Mette Fisker-Nielsen, pp. 65\u201366.name=\"Oxford University Press\"> There has been a \"fractured view\" of the Soka Gakkai in Japan. On the one hand it is seen as a politically and socially engaged movement;Takesato Watanabe, \"The Movement and the Japanese Media\" in David Machacek and Bryan Wilson (eds.), Global Citizens, Oxford University Press, 2000. \"The Soka Gakkai is exceptional in that no other large Japanese religious organization engages in both social and political issues\u2014from the promotion of human rights to the protection of the environment and abolition of nuclear weapons\u2014as actively as it does.\" (p. 217) on the other, it is still viewed with suspicion by some Japanese. \"When I conducted a survey of 235 Doshisha University students a few years ago asking their opinions about the Gakkai and how much they knew about its peace education programs, over 80 percent responded that they had a negative image of the movement and about 60 percent thought that its \"peace movement\" is little more than promotional propaganda. The few respondents with a positive image were either Soka Gakkai members, were related members, or were friends of members.\"Phillip E. Hammond and David W. Machacek, \"Soka Gakkai International\" in J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann (eds.), Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 2658.  \"Daisaku Ikeda (b. 1928), Soka Gakkai's charismatic third president, led the international growth of the movement. Although Ikeda and his successor, Einosuke Akiya, have gone to great lengths to improve the movement's public image, suspicion remains. Soka Gakkai's political involvement through the organ of the Komeito, a political party founded by the Soka Gakkai, and the near godlike reverence that members have for President Ikeda have tended to perpetuate public distrust. Although it has been subjected to a generalized suspicion toward Eastern religious movements in the United States, Europe, and South America, the movement's history outside of Japan has been tranquil by comparison to its Japanese history.\" James R. Lewis claims the Soka Gakkai's perception has suffered from sensationalist and often irresponsible treatment by the media even though the group has matured into a responsible member of society. \"\"For over half a century, one of the most controversial new religions in Japan has been Soka Gakkai. Although this group has matured into a responsible member of society, its ongoing connection with reformist political activity served to keep it in the public eye.  Until relatively recently, it also had a high profile as the result of sensationalist and often irresponsible media coverage.  Apparently as a direct consequence of the social consensus against this religion, some scholars have felt free to pen harsh critiques of Soka Gakkai--critiques in which the goal of promoting understanding has been eclipsed by efforts to delegitimate Soka Gakkai by portraying it as deluded, wrong, and/or socially dangerous.\u00a0... Soka Gakkai also spread to the United States and Europe, where it aroused controversy as a result of its intense proselytizing activities. Although it was never as controversial as groups like the Hare Krishna Movement or the Unification Church, Soka Gakkai\u2014which in the United States went under the name Nichiren Shoshu of America after Soka Gakkai broke with Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b\u2014was not infrequently stereotyped as a brainwashing cult, particularly by anti-cult authors.\" Other scholars reject the cult label.Macioti, p. 124. \"It should be clear to all by now that Soka Gakkai is not a \"sect.\" It is not a small, two-faced cult, characterized by obscure and hidden agendas. Rather it is a movement that has given life to varied associations, all of which are engaged in promoting culture, and raising interest around the theme of values\u2014and a movement that demands to be examined more closely by using scientific methodologies and instruments of evaluation.\" Some scholars who utilize the Bryan R. Wilson typology of newly emerging denominations categorize it as \"gnostic-manipulationist\", a category of teachings holding that the world can improve as people master the right means and techniques to overcome their problems.Bryan Wilson, Religion in Secular Society. Penguin, 1969Bryan Wilson, Magic and the Millennium, Heinemann, London, 1973, pp. 18\u201330  According to Anne Mette Fisker-Nielsen, \"Soka Gakkai's relentless, but highly successful, proselytizing in the 1950s stirred up fear in wider society. Soka Gakkai was portrayed by the mass media as aggressive even violent\u00a0\u2013 although it is difficult to find evidence.\"Mette Fisker-Nielsen, Anne (2012) \"Religion and Politics in Contemporary Japan: Soka Gakkai Youth and Komeito\", Routledge, p. 52.  Throughout the 1950s, the Soka Gakkai was a relatively radical movement that remained outside mainstream Japanese society, but since the foundation of the Komeito in the 1960s, it has considerably moderated its activities and has become a very mainstream movement, especially after the Komeito joined the coalition government in 1999."]}, {"page": "Eileen Barker", "response": ["In a 2003 collection of essays in honour of Eileen Barker, the influential Oxford University-based religious scholar Bryan R.

It may be able to deflate some widely circulated rumours and false impressions derived from media comment\". Wilson added that Barker's social science research, in particular her work on the Unification Church, had been instrumental in demonstrating that the brainwashing concept, which for some years had enjoyed popularity in the media, was unable to explain what actually happened in the process of religious conversion, or to explain why so many members of new religious movements actually leave these movements again after a short period."]}, {"page": "Peoples Temple", "response": ["The mass suicide of the Peoples Temple has helped embed the idea that all new religious movements are destructive in the public's mind.
