On 29 August 1995, while Boutros-Ghali was unreachable on an airplane, Annan instructed United Nations officials to \"relinquish for a limited period of time their authority to veto air strikes in Bosnia.\" This move allowed NATO forces to conduct Operation Deliberate Force and made him a favorite of the United States.

The parties to the accord also agreed to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia, later initiated through the subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 721 of 27 November.
