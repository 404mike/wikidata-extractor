This is derived from the Old English tribal name H\u00e6stingas, meaning `the constituency (followers) of H\u00e6sta'. Symeon of Durham records the victory of Offa in 771 over the Hestingorum gens, that is, \"the people of the Hastings tribe.\" Hastingleigh in Kent was named after that tribe. The place name H\u00e6stingaceaster is found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for 1050,Eilert Ekwall, The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, Oxford University Press, 1936.Mills, A.

However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that H\u00e6stingaceaster may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at Pevensey."]}, {"page": "Yankee", "response": ["Michael Quinion and Patrick Hanks argue that the term comes from the Dutch name Janneke, a diminutive form of Jan (John) which would be Anglicized as \"Yankee\" due to the Dutch pronunciation of J as the English Y. Quinion and Hanks posit that it was \"used as a nickname for a Dutch-speaking American in colonial times\" and could have grown to include non-Dutch colonists, as well. The Oxford English Dictionary calls this theory \"perhaps the most plausible\".

Patrick Hanks points out that 13th-century manorial records describe the village as Stockenechurch, which would logically come from OE stoccen + cirice, literally \"logs church\". This therefore means, he argues, that the village's name originated from a description of a church made from logs. However Starey and Viccars, in their study of the village point to the geography of the local area and the fact that in 1086 Stokenchurch was a woodland in the chapelry of Aston Rowant in Oxfordshire. They present the Hanks opinion as a credible origin however argue that due to the geography the name is more likely to come from the alternative meaning for the Anglo Saxon word stocc, which is an outlying farm or secondary settlement."]}, {"page": "List of lexicographers", "response": ["*Patrick Hanks (UK, born 1940) English language general, onomastic, and LSP"]}, {"page": "List of English words of Hebrew origin", "response": ["*HH: A Dictionary of First Names, Patrick Hanks & Flavia Hodges"]}, {"page": "Price (surname)", "response": ["The name is thought to have originally been spelled \"Pryce\" and pronounced \"Preese\".

It was also used as a surname in Britain from at least the 17th century. Its popularity in Britain as a feminine name is owed to the character Wendy Darling from the 1904 play Peter Pan and its 1911 novelisation Peter and Wendy by J. M. Barrie.Was the name Wendy invented for the book Peter Pan? at The Straight DopePatrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges, Dictionary of First Names, 1990 Its popularity reached a peak in the 1960s, and subsequently declined.
