His first goal of the season came in a Scottish League Cup second round match against Brechin City on 27 August 2008. Described variously as \"stunning\", \"unstoppable\", \"sublime\" and \"a thunderbolt\", he scored the second in a 2\u20130 win when he received a cross from Garry Hay and flicked the ball into the top corner. His next two goals were late winners in successive matches: on 4 October in a 2\u20131 win at Hearts he made a well-timed run into the box in the 82nd minute to collect a return pass from Donovan Simmonds and finish well into the bottom corner; and then on 18 October he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win at home to Motherwell, slipping the ball into the net at the far post in the 89th minute after a deflected shot-cum-cross from Jamie Hamill. Manager Jim Jefferies praised Bryson after the win over Hearts, saying his late run into the box and finish was comparable to a move by Colin Cameron. He was also named man of the match after the win over Motherwell."]}, {"page": "2007 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|LB ||3 || Garry Hay (c)"]}, {"page": "Manuel Pascali", "response": ["At the start of the season, Pascali started the 2011\u201312 campaign with a 1\u20131 draw against Dundee United on 24 July 2011 and soon became a temporary skipper for the club. After a match against Rangers on 27 September 2011, which Kilmarnock lost 2\u20130, Pascali was involved in an altercation in the tunnel with Rangers defender Steven Whittaker which Rangers' manager Ally McCoist dismissed as 'handbags' and \"like two boys in the playground\" in his post-match press conference. Manager Kenny Shiels wanted an end to the row that developed between Kirk Broadfoot and Pascali and referred to Broadfoot as \"the ugly boy from Rangers\" and \"the male model from Ayrshire\" in a radio interview. However, Broadfoot claimed Pascali made death threats and was \"in my face saying he was going to kill me\". In response to this, Pascali denied his [Broadfoot] claim and branded Broadfoot a publicity-seeking coward. Four days after the incident on 1 October 2011, Pascali scored his first of the season in a 2\u20131 defeat by St Johnstone. On 19 November 2011, Pascali scored his second goal of the season in a 1\u20131 draw against Hibernian, followed up by scoring the winning goal for Kilmarnock in a 1\u20130 win at Rugby Park against Rangers in the Scottish Premier League on 27 November 2011. Following his goal against Rangers, Pascali spoke to BBC Scotland's Chick Young and said scoring against Rangers was the best day of his career. On 7 January 2012, Pascali scored the only goal for Kilmarnock in a 1\u20131 draw against Dundee in the Scottish Cup. On 11 February 2012, Pascali broke his leg while stretching for the ball during training. He spent the rest of the 2011\u201312 season on the sidelines. He ended the season with 30 appearances and four goals (three in the league and one in the Scottish Cup). During his rehabilitation, Pascali signed a new deal with Kilmarnock. He penned a three-year contract and manager Shiels described Pascali as \"one of the three quartermasters\" along with Garry Hay and James Fowler."]}, {"page": "2001 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|LB ||24 || Garry Hay "]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Ayr United F.C. season", "response": ["| 28/09/2010 || Garry Hay's Testimonial match || Kilmarnock || 4\u20131 L || Roberts(p 49) || 3,774", "After numerous years of Service Kilmarnock veteran Garry Hay was awarded with a testimonial match against local neighbours, Ayr United.
