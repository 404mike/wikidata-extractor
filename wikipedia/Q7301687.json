Eventually, Fiz confesses her role in the crime and so the police arrest Fiz for Colin's murder. At the police station, Fiz is interviewed for the murder. She is taken into custody but is released and then attends Magistrates' Court. The incident is deemed too serious, so she is sent to Crown Court. Fiz is charged with three murders after John flees the country to Ireland. Fiz is remanded in custody and faces trial at Crown court. Fiz is denied bail and is sent straight to prison to await trial. Fiz struggles with life in prison and to cope without Hope, who has been left in the care of Roy and Hayley. She is offered a place in the Mother and Baby unit, but refuses as she feels it is no place to bring her baby up. She becomes even more distressed when she is forced to do some cleaning in the mother and baby unit, as seeing other mums with their babies upsets her and reminds her of her daughter. Fiz soon changes her mind and requests a place in the unit, but is forced to wait. Horrified when she finds her cellmate, Ginny Portis (Ashley McGuire), unconscious from a drug overdose, Fiz is shocked to discover that her friend Ruth Walsh (Rebecca Callard) has supplied the drugs. When Fiz plans to reveal Ruth's drug supply to the governor, Ruth threatens to make her life a misery. Fiz eventually gets a place in the mother and baby unit, but is beaten up by Ruth and other girls when Ruth is removed from the unit for dealing drugs. Ruth and her friends continue to torment Fiz. After Ruth trashes her room, Fiz stands up to her and tells her to keep away from she and Hope. Upon learning the date of Fiz's trial, it is revealed to the audience that John has returned. Spotting Rosie from his car, who is trying to sell her boyfriend Jason's flat, he poses as a potential buyer named Mr. Chips. He turns up at the flat and ties Rosie up, insisting that it is all her fault that he and Fiz are so miserable and trying to force her to turn up at the court and tell them that it is John who is responsible for the deaths, allowing him to release Fiz but not go to prison himself. His plan fails, however, and he has to drive away at a high speed and crashes his car."]}, {"page": "Band of Gold (TV series)", "response": ["* Rebecca Callard as Tula (Series 2)"]}, {"page": "Bonjour la Classe", "response": ["*Rebecca Callard \u2013 Lucy Cornwell"]}, {"page": "The Mrs Bradley Mysteries", "response": ["Peter Davison as Inspector Christmas; Pooky Quesnel as Delilah Hicks; Isla Blair as Myrtle Quincey; Rebecca Callard as Cecily Moody; Jason O'Mara as Jake Hicks; Matthew Burgess as Constable Sharp; Charlotte Francis as Temperance Baines; John Bowe as Reverend Baines; Alex Palmer as Lester Hicks; Katy Lown as Polly; Eddie Marsan as Ronald Quincey."]}, {"page": "The Return of the Borrowers", "response": ["* Rebecca Callard as Arrietty Clock"]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Ruth Walsh || Rebecca Callard || 2011"]}, {"page": "The Borrowers Aloft", "response": ["*The Return of the Borrowers: The 1993 sequel to The Borrowers, this BBC TV series starred Ian Holm, Penelope Wilton and Rebecca Callard.
