Its earliest forms are associated with the work of G.E. Moore and the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, in addition to a number of mid-20th century philosophers who can be split into two main groups, neither of which could be described as an organized \"school\". In its earlier stages, contemporaries of Wittgenstein at Cambridge University such as Norman Malcolm, Alice Ambrose, Friedrich Waismann, Oets Kolk Bouwsma and Morris Lazerowitz started to develop ideas recognisable as ordinary language philosophy. These ideas were further elaborated from 1945 onwards through the work of some Oxford University philosophers led initially by Gilbert Ryle, then followed by J. L. Austin. This Oxford group also included H. L. A. Hart, Geoffrey Warnock, J. O. Urmson and P. F. Strawson. The close association between ordinary language philosophy and these later thinkers has led to it sometimes being called \"Oxford philosophy\". More recent philosophers with at least some commitment to the method of ordinary language philosophy include Stanley Cavell, John Searle and Oswald Hanfling."]}, {"page": "Mary Warnock, Baroness Warnock", "response": ["From 1949\u201366, Warnock was a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St Hugh's College, Oxford.
