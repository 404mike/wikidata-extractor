Goldberg", "response": ["Goldberg also collaborated with Karman in 1972 to help perform abortions on women in Bangladesh who had been raped by the Pakistani army. Sandra Kabir reported that hundreds of thousands of women had been raped in Bangladesh at this time. Later, Karman and Goldberg had a serious problem with an experimental abortion method known as the supercoil abortion which later caused dangerous side effects. Goldberg intended to help women from Chicago who were scheduled to have abortions, but whose clinic had been shut down. On the weekend of May 13, 1972, she brought the women to Philadelphia where Karman would use the supercoil method. The method had not been tested carefully prior to using it on the women from Chicago. Critics of the incident said that women were being experimented on, however, Goldberg insisted that they knew the risks going into the procedure. Karman and Goldberg again helped provide abortions in Cyprus in 1974 where women had been raped during the Turkish invasion."]}]}}
