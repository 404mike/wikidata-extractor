He observed \"a certain hard body adherent to the auditory nerve,\" and concluded this cause of deafness was beyond the reach of medication or surgery and was therefore incurable. The Schwann cells that multiply to form a VS on the vestibulocochlear nerve were identified 60 years later in 1838 by the German physiologist Theodor Schwann, the co-founder with the botanist Matthias Schleiden of the critically important cell theory that all living things are composed of cells. In 1895, Thomas Annandale, a general surgeon at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, Scotland, was the first to successfully localize and surgically remove a VS. His achievement was exceptional. Finger dissection of VS to 'shell out' the tumor was typical. The main goal when dealing with large tumors was preservation of life.", "By the 1980s, radiation therapy was also becoming an attractive option for VS patients. At the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, Lars Leksell (1907\u20131986) pioneered Gamma Knife radiosurgery. In 1951, he published his landmark scientific paper, \"The Stereotaxic Method and Radiosurgery of the Brain,\" defining radiosurgery as \"the destruction of intracranial targets without opening the skull using very high doses of ionizing radiation in stereotactically directed beams.\" The first Gamma Knife machine was operable in Sweden in 1969, and the first Gamma Knife in the U.S. was installed in 1987 at the Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, PA. Departments of radiation oncology at major medical centers began to modify X-ray linear accelerators (linacs) to do single-session radiosurgery and multiple-session radiotherapy. In 1991, the U.S. National Institutes of Health convened a Consensus Development Conference (December 11\u201313, 1991) for Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma) to evaluate management of the disorder and recommend areas for future activity and research.See Richard T.
