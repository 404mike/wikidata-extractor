He moved on to Darlington where he played until 1975.\nHe was player-manager of Darlington during the 1974\u201375 season, in which the club had to apply for re-election. He left the club at the end of the season and was appointed as coach to Darlington's arch-rivals Hartlepool. In October 1976, he took over as manager, and had two separate spells in this role: one from 1976\u20131983 and the other from 1983\u20131986. Although Hartlepool applied for re-election to the League on three occasions, Horner also guided the club to a respectable 9th-place finish in 1980\u201381, during which the club had been promotion contenders. In his second spell at the club, Hartlepool finished 7th in 1985\u201386, in which they had also been a promotion contender for much of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ray Kennedy", "response": ["Kennedy signed with Mick Docherty's Hartlepool United of the Fourth Division in November 1983. Docherty was sacked the following month, and unsuccessfully attempted to report the club for negotiating an illegal contract with Kennedy. His assistant, Billy Horner, stepped up to manage the club for a second time in the face of a mounting financial crisis. Hartlepool were forced to apply for re-election at the end of the season, and Kennedy was promoted to player-coach for his help in boosting support for the club's re-election campaign. However, he left Victoria Park in summer 1984 to take up the position as player-manager of Cypriot side Pezoporikos. He became increasingly unable to play the game though due to his body's physical decline, and after a poor start to the 1984\u201385 season he returned to England in December against the board's wishes and handed in his resignation the following month, to allow him to run the Melton Constable public house in Seaton Sluice, Whitley Bay. In January 1985, he joined Northern League side Ashington, managed by former teammate Colin Todd, but could only manage six appearances after suffering from increasingly alarming stiffness in his right leg due to his worsening Parkinson's disease. Unable to turn out for his own Melton Constable Sunday League team, he soon found daily life difficult to cope with."]}, {"page": "Horner", "response": ["*Billy Horner (born 1942), English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "William Horner", "response": ["* Billy Horner, English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Keith Houchen", "response": ["He started his professional career at Hartlepool United in February 1978, after failing to win a contract at Chesterfield. He was coached by Billy Horner to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to sell him on to Leyton Orient for \u00a325,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress in his two years in London, he was moved on to York City for \u00a315,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's Fourth Division title winning season in 1983\u201384, before transferring to Scunthorpe United for \u00a340,000 in March 1986. He did not settle at the club, but in the summer he was fortunate enough to win a \u00a360,000 move up through three tiers to First Division side Coventry City.", "He was not offered a professional contract at Chesterfield by manager Arthur Cox and so left the club without making a senior appearance at Saltergate. However, he was soon spotted playing amateur football in Nunthorpe by Hartlepool United manager Billy Horner. Houchen joined the \"Monkey Hangers\" on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one-year contract on \u00a330 a week. When he arrived at the Victoria Park, Hartlepool were a struggling Fourth Division club. He made his debut in a 1\u20131 home draw with Crewe Alexandra. Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that \"we used to have a mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques. Only about six of them would go through and the rest would bounce.\" He scored his first senior goal against Barnsley on 24 March 1978. He scored further goals against Darlington, Rochdale and Newport County to end the 1977\u201378 campaign with four goals in 13 games. He played regular first team football in 1978\u201379, and scored 13 goals in 42 games to become the club's top scorer. He then went on to score 14 goals in 44 games in 1979\u201380, as the club finished 19th, just two points above the re-election zone. His goalscoring record attracted the attention of bigger clubs, however club chairman Vince Barker told Reading that even if Houchen was available then they would not be able to afford him. His exploits continued into the following season, and the club rejected bids of up to \u00a380,000 from Plymouth Argyle and Cardiff City. He scored 17 goals in 48 appearances in 1980\u201381, yet again becoming the club's top scorer, as Hartlepool were in the promotion hunt until a late spell of bad form sent them down the table to ninth. He hit 19 goals in 38 games in 1981\u201382 to become the club's top-scorer for a fourth consecutive season. However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.", "He left Vale Park on a free transfer in June 1993 and turned down a move to Cyprus outfit AC Omonia to return to former club Hartlepool United. Injury meant he did not play for the man who signed him, Viv Busby, and instead he made his second debut for the club under John MacPhail. Houchen went on to score eight goals in 37 games as Hartlepool were relegated into the bottom tier of the Football League in 1993\u201394, finishing a massive 17 points behind Blackpool, who were one point above the relegation zone. MacPhail was quickly sacked and replaced by David McCreery; MacPhail blamed the fact that the club was sometimes unable to pay the player's wages as a reason for poor results on the field. Houchen was a coach at the club, but quickly fell out with temporary 'advisory coach' Sandy Clark. Houchen scored a hat-trick against Bury, though was later sent off in the match for allegedly swearing at referee Kevin Lynch; at the time of the incident Houchen was receiving treatment for knee ligament damage which would keep him out of action for six weeks. McCreery resigned on 20 April 1995, and chairman Harold Hornsey appointed Houchen as his replacement; he became the 23rd manager at the club in 38 years. He appointed his former boss Billy Horner as youth team coach and also employed Brian Honour and Mick Tait. His first game in charge was a 4\u20130 home win over Hereford United, and a 3\u20130 defeat at Preston North End and a final day 3\u20132 victory over Mansfield Town ensured Hartlepool an 18th-place finish. As a player, he was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 39 appearances in 1994\u201395, and was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters.", "Houchen was a big  centre-forward who had strength and power. Early in his career he broke his ribs and backbone, but learned the tricks of the trade, such as interlinking arms with opposition players to prevent them from jumping. Billy Horner compared him with Malcolm Poskett, and stated the only quality missing in Houchen's game was aggression. Horner and his coaching team of George Smith and Willie Maddren taught Houchen how to protect himself from the highly physical centre-halves that dominated the division, and the youngster learned how to hold the ball up and bring other players into the attack."]}]}}
