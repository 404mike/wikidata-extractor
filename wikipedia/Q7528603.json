One of Nowell's claims was that Middleton's acquaintance with Thomas Haweis was supposed to be enough to get him holy orders, refused by the Bishop of Hereford (Lord James Beauclerk) on the grounds of insufficient learning, through unspecified influence. The Chieveley incident was reported to date to three years earlier. Two further prominent defenders of the students were George Whitefield and \"The Shaver\", the pseudonym of the Baptist minister John Macgowan, who waxed satirical against the academics.Catharine K.
