His father George moved to up a new post in the Carriage and Wagon works of the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) at Stratford, Essex seemingly at some point in or before 1846. George, his wife Hephzibah and surviving children Martin, Mary Curtis, George and Frederick moved to 1 Angel Place, Leyton Road, near the Works. Elizabeth, Phoebe Ann and Caroline were born between 1847 and 1851 though Caroline died about aged two. Martin Atock, some 10 years older than Frederick, entered the employ of the ECR about 1848 and left to Ireland in 1861 in to take up positions of locomotive superintendent firstly at the Waterford and Limerick Railway and subsequently at the Midland Great Western Railway."]}, {"page": "MGWR Class E", "response": ["The MGWR class E was a small 0-6-0T steam locomotive class designed in 1891 by Martin Atock, the then locomotive superintendent of the Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) and twelve engines were built.

He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, England.  His father, Sir Ralph Smith Cusack was Chairman of the MGWR from 1865 to 1905 and his brother-in-law, Major Major James William Henry Claud \"H.C.\" Cusack was Deputy Chairman of the MGWR from 1905. His mother was Elizabeth Barker  He served a four-year apprenticeship with Kitson and Company, England, followed by two years at Crewe, then returned to Ireland as a junior draughtsman in 1890.  He married Constance Louisa Vernon in 1892.  When Martin Atock announced his intended retirement from the MGWR Henry Edward Cusack was appointed his joint first assistant locomotive engineer with Basil Hope from the North Eastern Railway.  Martin Atock's son, Thomas, was appointed as second assistant.  Cusack rose to take the Chief Mechancial Engineers position from 1905-1915 and was replaced by the young draughtsman W. H. Morton who rose to support him.", "Cusack oversaw the introduction of MGWR Class D on the transition from his predecessor Martin Atock.  The first attributed locomotive to his era was the MGWR Class A, the largest 4-4-0 in Ireland at the time of introduction in 1902.  The smaller MGWR Class C 4-4-0 followed from 1909.  His era also saw the MGWR Class B goods 0-6-0, an attempt at a larger freight engine.  It is generally noted W. H. Morton is likely to have assisted Cusack with practical design input."]}, {"page": "MGWR Class A", "response": ["In the late 1800s successively more powerful passenger locomotives had been introduced to facilitate increasing train weights and passenger timings.  With Class K the limits of the 2-4-0 were being approached and the rival Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR) had been using 4-4-0's not only on their main Dublin-Cork but secondary routes also and were at the beginning of the 1900s introducing a further generation of larger 4-4-0s.  Martin Atock of the MGWR was known to be resistant to bogies but perhaps influenced by his deputy Edward Cusack in 1900 at the end of his service organised rebuilds of older 2-4-0 locomotives to a small 4-4-0.  When Cusack succeeded Atock he chose to quickly follow through with six large 4-4-0s that to were become known as Class A for the MGWR's premier passenger trains and which were the largest in Ireland for a short while after their introduction."]}, {"page": "MGWR Class P", "response": ["The Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) Class P were an 0-6-0T tank locomotive designed by Martin Atock introduced in 1881 designed for shunting and banking round North Wall freight yard.

The first 0-4-2s were introduced by the Locomotive Superintendent Joseph Cabry, and his successor Robert Ramage in 1863 also seemed to favour the type.  After Martin Atock succeeded in 1872 there were no more orders of the type due to generally poor timekeeping.", "For the final batch of new build locomotives the MGWR switched supplier back to Neilsons.  Following design changes instigated by Martin Atock most of this batch had a four-ring boiler  longer with modified frames.  With their withdrawal in 1892 the use of 0-4-2 by the MGWR came to an end."]}, {"page": "MGWR Class 6", "response": ["The final  engines ordered in the pre Martin Atock era were from Avonside and formed MGWR Class 18.  They were the only significant non 4-2-0 order made by the locomotive engineer Robert Rampage.

The difficulty lies in a coupling rod over more than 2 axles is more complex to allow for vertical motion.  The next two Locomotive Superintendents, Joseph Cabry and Robert Ramage, remained with the 2-4-0, 4-2-0 and even 2-2-2 one or two driving axles designs.
