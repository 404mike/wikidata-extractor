McDonough felt that religion was distracting them from focusing on playing; speaking of Moyes, Alan Comfort and Graham Daniels, he said: \"The three of them sat in the changing room with a little black book, discussing their faith, when they should have been getting psyched up for a relegation scrap.\" Following a 3\u20133 draw with Wigan Athletic on 9 March 1985, McDonough, who was 26 years old at the time, states that he \"battered\" Moyes for not putting sufficient effort into the game.", "Moyes is a devout Christian who would often discuss religion with Alan Comfort and Graham Daniels, although he is often reluctant to talk about his faith in interviews."]}, {"page": "Ron Lauback", "response": ["In 1980, old friend (and fellow ex-Sinner) Dave Machan persuaded Ron to perform again, along with vocalist Kathy Monaco this time in a folk based group called Trinity (Ron played bass for this group). Trinity recorded an albums' worth of material at Dayson Studios (owned by George Day and also home to much of the work done by Ron Wray for the History of Syracuse Music releases) which still remains unreleased. Though Trinity was successful on the nightclub scene, Ron wanted to return to the rock music that was his first love, and tried to re-form The Saint and the Sinners which soon changed their name to East Side Story (later East Side). East Side specialized in classic oldies and seventies hard rock. This band lasted (with virtually the same line-up) for fifteen years before folding in 2000. Some of the members of East Side were Graham Daniels (1984\u20132000), Larry Brennan (1984\u20132000), Tom DiRenzo (1988\u20132000), John Mirra (1991\u20131993; 1997\u20132000), Earl \"the Pearl\" Hamilton (formerly of The New York Flyers now with Redline (1994\u20131997), Dave Machan (1984\u20131987) and Barry Glisker (1984\u20131989)."]}]}}
