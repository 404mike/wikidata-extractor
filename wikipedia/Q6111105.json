He began his football career as an amateur with Birmingham (later renamed Birmingham City) in 1934 but his career was seriously disrupted by the Second World War. He turned professional in 1946 after his Army service. He helped the club win the Second Division championship in 1947\u201348 and 1954\u201355. He played in the semifinal of the 1955\u201356 FA Cup in place of the injured Roy Warhurst, but Johnny Newman was preferred for the final. He was an adaptable, two-footed player, whose position of choice was full-back but who was used in a variety of positions by the club. He had a spell at Stourbridge before returning to Birmingham on the coaching staff, later becoming manager of Moor Green. He died in Birmingham aged 72.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Jack Badham \u2013 Footballer"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 in English football", "response": ["* 1 January 1992 - Jack Badham, 72, played 175 league games as a left-back or left-half for Birmingham City between 1946 and 1957."]}, {"page": "1956 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Semi-final opponents Sunderland found Birmingham without \"hard-man\" left-half Roy Warhurst, who had injured a thigh against Arsenal, but in Jack Badham they had an effective replacement.
