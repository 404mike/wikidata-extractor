He was a member of the European Tour in the 1970s and won his sole European Tour title at the 1975 Double Diamond Strokeplay. However his most consistent season by far was 1977, when he finished seventh on the European Tour Order of Merit, that being the only time he made the top thirty. He played in the 1977 Ryder Cup, becoming the first left-handed European to play in the competition. He also represented England in the World Cup that year partnering with Nick Faldo.\nSince leaving the European Tour in 1981 he has worked as a golf director and club professional in Hardelot France, and then Penina and Sao Lorenzo, Portugal. He was also to coach the national teams in Denmark (where his students included Thomas Bj\u00f8rn), Switzerland and Morocco. After turning 50, he played several seasons on the European Seniors Tour, with his best finish of 2nd after a playoff at the Tournament Players Championship at the Belfry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neil Coles", "response": ["| Peter Dawson"]}, {"page": "Nigerian Open", "response": ["| 1975 ||  ||  David Jagger || align=center|270 || align=center|\u221214 || Playoff ||  Harry Bannerman Peter Dawson || "]}, {"page": "Tournament Players Championship (United Kingdom)", "response": ["| 1977 ||  Neil Coles || align=center|288 || align=center|\u22124 || 1 stroke ||  Peter Dawson || align=center|8,000 || Foxhills"]}, {"page": "Double Diamond Individual Championship", "response": ["| 1975 ||  Peter Dawson || align=center|150 || align=center|+8 || 3 strokes ||  Martin Foster Dale Hayes || align=center|1,500 || Turnberry || "]}, {"page": "PGA Seniors Championship", "response": ["| 2000 ||  John Grace || align=center|282 || align=center|\u22126 || Playoff ||  Peter Dawson || The Belfry || "]}, {"page": "List of European Ryder Cup golfers", "response": ["| Peter Dawson ||  || 1977", "|ENG || align=left|Peter Dawson || 1977 || 1977 || 1 || 3 || 1 ||  || 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "Peter Dawson", "response": ["Peter Dawson may refer to:", "*Peter Dawson (bass-baritone) (1882\u20131961), Australian bass-baritone who gained worldwide renown in the 1920s and 1930s", "*Peter Dawson, chief winemaker of the Hardy Wine Company ", "*Peter Dawson (politician) (1892\u20131963), Canadian politician", "*Peter Dawson (cyclist) (born 1982), Australian Olympic cyclist", "*Peter Dawson (golfer) (born 1950), English golfer", "*Peter Dawson (cricketer) (1946\u20132012), former English cricketer", "*Peter Dawson (swimmer) (born 1957), Australian Olympic swimmer", "*Peter Dawson (priest) (1929\u20132013), Archdeacon of Norfolk", "*Peter Dawson (trade unionist) (1940-2005), Welsh trade union leader", "*Peter Dawson, character in the film Heathers, played by Jeremy Applegate", "*Peter Dawson, character in the Rising Stars comic book"]}, {"page": "1977 Ryder Cup", "response": ["| align=left| Peter Dawson", "|Peter Dawson", "|align=left|Peter Dawson || 1 || 1\u20132\u20130 || 1\u20130\u20130 || 0\u20131\u20130 || 0\u20131\u20130"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Peter Dawson||1950\u2013"]}, {"page": "English Amateur", "response": ["| 1969 || Royal St George's Golf Club || John Cook || align=center|6 & 4 || Peter Dawson || "]}, {"page": "1975 European Tour", "response": ["| Peter Dawson (1)"]}, {"page": "1977 European Tour", "response": ["|align=center|7 || Peter Dawson || || align=center|17,583"]}, {"page": "Coca-Cola Young Professionals' Championship", "response": ["| 1973 || Bernard Gallacher ||  || Bristol & Clifton Golf Club(and Long Ashton Golf Club) || align=center|277 || 4 strokes ||  Peter Dawson || align=center|600 || "]}, {"page": "Double Diamond International", "response": ["*England: Tony Jacklin (Captain), Neil Coles, Nick Faldo, Tommy Horton, Peter Dawson"]}, {"page": "Carris Trophy", "response": ["|1968 || Peter Dawson || Moor Park || 149"]}, {"page": "1977 World Cup (men's golf)", "response": ["|Peter Dawson and Nick Faldo"]}, {"page": "EGA Trophy", "response": ["*1969 John Cook, Peter Dawson, John Davies, Bob Durrant, Andrew Forrester, Warren Humphreys, Bill Lockie, Doug McClelland, George McKay"]}]}}
