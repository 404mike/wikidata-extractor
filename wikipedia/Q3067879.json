During his playing career, Grant played for Celtic, Norwich City, Reading and AFC Bournemouth. He was awarded a testimonial match, played against Bayern Munich, by Celtic in 1997. Grant played in two full international matches for Scotland, both in 1989. Since retiring as a player, Grant has since worked as a football coach.

His approach annoyed some teammates who sought retribution during training sessions; Bellamy later commented, \"one or two of them would try to clean me out with flying tackles. They wanted to bring me down a peg or two.\" One training session left him \"nearly in tears\" after Kevin Scott repeatedly singled him out. Bellamy won support from his midfield partner, the experienced Peter Grant, who struck up a friendship with Bellamy. Bruce Rioch was appointed Norwich manager in 1998 and instantly moved Bellamy from central midfield to attack. The decision reaped rewards immediately; Bellamy scored seven goals in his first eight league appearances of the campaign, including his first career hat-trick on 22 August 1998 in a 4\u20132 home win over Queens Park Rangers. By November, he was one of the leading goalscorers in the First Division and was rewarded with a new five-year contract."]}, {"page": "Jamie Cureton", "response": ["Colchester initially rejected the transfer request, saying that Cureton was an important part of the club's future and that they wanted to keep him, though Norwich City manager Peter Grant confirmed that he would like to sign Cureton.

Despite the criticism, Manager Peter Grant praised Ashdown, saying: \"Jamie put both hands up and said it's the worst he's played in two years in the two games.

Hutton also took part in Villa's 2\u20131 defeat to local rivals West Brom, where a tackle on Shane Long injured Long's knee keeping him out for six weeks. The tackle received no punishment during the game but later sparked a retrospective debate as to the fairness of the challenge. After the match his tackle was labelled 'vicious' by West Brom manager Roy Hodgson. Hutton was defended by Villa assistant manager Peter Grant, who insisted that Hutton is not a dirty player. McLeish also came out in support of Hutton, as well as expressing sympathy for Long. Later in the season Hutton's fiery reputation continued, as he was shown a second yellow card and sent off in Villa's 2\u20131 defeat at home to Arsenal on 21 December."]}, {"page": "Adam Drury (footballer, born 1978)", "response": ["In the close season of 2004 Norwich signed competition for Drury in the shape of the experienced Simon Charlton from Bolton Wanderers but Charlton often ended up playing in the centre of defence with Drury retaining his place on the left. Loss of form during the 2004\u201305 Premier League season did lead to Drury being dropped for a short time and he was relieved of the captaincy (which passed to Craig Fleming) until the start of the 2006\u201307 season when he was re-instated. Towards the end of the 2004\u201305 season he found his form again and turned in an outstanding display as part of the Norwich team that beat Manchester United 2\u20130 at Carrow Road. He continued to be a key member of the Norwich squad on their return to the Championship for season 2005\u201306. Norwich manager Nigel Worthington named Drury as Norwich City captain for the 2006\u201307 season, though Worthington's successor Peter Grant awarded the captaincy to Jason Shackell at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 campaign."]}, {"page": "Luke Chadwick", "response": ["On 13 November 2006, Chadwick signed on loan for Norwich City until 3 January; he was signed by Peter Grant, who had worked with him at Reading and West Ham.

After his loan ended, he signed a 2-year deal for a 200,000 fee. He said that his transfer was due to his wife and children returning to Cambridge."]}, {"page": "Youssef Safri", "response": ["Following the 3\u20131 defeat at Plymouth Argyle in September 2006, Safri and teammate Dickson Etuhu were reported to have traded punches on the team bus during their return journey to East Anglia, although these reports are now thought to have been discredited. After Peter Grant was appointed Norwich manager in October 2006, Safri was not a regular selection. There was speculation that he would leave the club in January 2007, fuelled by his comments in the Eastern Daily Press on 29 December 2006 in which Safri indicated that he would seek a transfer if Grant continued to use him as a substitute. Safri remained at Carrow Road until the end of the 2006\u201307 season, but after falling out with manager Peter Grant, Grant stated in the press on 1 August that Safri would not play for the club again."]}]}}
