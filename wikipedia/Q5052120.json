A small number of pilgrims began visiting the shrine. The Right Reverend Graham Leonard, Bishop of Willesden 1964-1973, actively promoted pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Willesden, and in 1972 a new \"Black Madonna\" statue was commissioned from the sculptor Catharni Stern. On completion it was set in the former chapel of St Catherine within St Mary's parish church, Willesden, and the chapel was redesignated the Shrine Chapel. A visit to this chapel is now the climax of the Willesden pilgrimage."]}]}}
