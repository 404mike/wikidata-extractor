At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was \"unlawfully expelled from the partnership\" for what he called a \"personality clash\" with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: \"I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs\". McCarroll was replaced by Alan White, formerly of Starclub and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist Steve White and recommended to Noel by Paul Weller.

After taking time off for most of 1990, he returned to the road late in the year, touring as \"The Paul Weller Movement\" with long-term drummer and friend Steve White and Paul Francis (session bassist from The James Taylor Quartet). After a slow start playing small clubs with a mixture of Jam/Style Council classics as well as showcasing new material such as \"Into Tomorrow\", by the time of the release of his 1992 LP, Paul Weller, he had begun to re-establish himself as a leading British singer-songwriter. This self-titled album saw a return to a more jazz-guitar-focused sound, featuring samples and a funk influence with shades of the Style Council sound.
