The decision was made to film the battle scenes in neutral Ireland, where it was easier to find the 650 extras.

Walton also provided the music for Olivier's next two Shakespearean adaptations, Hamlet (1948) and Richard III (1955). Henry V was warmly received by critics. The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian wrote that the film combined \"new art hand-in-hand with old genius, and both superbly of one mind\", in a film that worked \"triumphantly\". The critic for The Times considered that Olivier \"plays Henry on a high, heroic note and never is there danger of a crack\", in a film described as \"a triumph of film craft\".

Larkin included six of his own poems\u2014the same number as for Rupert Brooke.
