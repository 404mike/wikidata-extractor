The Governor of New South Wales, Sir Ralph Darling, considered him to be incompetent and tried to persuade the Colonial Office to dismiss him, but Baxter resigned in order to become a judge in Tasmania. In Tasmania, the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir George Arthur, managed to prevent Baxter from taking up his post. Baxter returned to England later in 1831 and died in 1834.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
