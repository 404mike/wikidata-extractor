The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. \nSouthgate was the organiser (leader) of the SOE's STATIONER network (or circuit) operating in a large area centered on Ch\u00e2teauroux in central France and Tarbes in southern France from 1942 to 1944. He was captured by the SS in Montlu\u00e7on in 1944 and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp where he survived until its liberation by American forces in 1945. Southgate was regarded by Maurice Buckmaster, head of SOE's French Section, as one of his best agents.", "link_mentions": {}}}
