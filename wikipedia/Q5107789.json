After playing 19 successive matches from August to December, he was dropped by caretaker manager Viv Busby. Despite this, he stated his determination at earning a new contract with York. After discussing his future at York with manager Billy McEwan he was offered a one-year professional contract in April 2005. He stalled on this contract offer and McEwan criticised him, saying \"He's a young apprentice getting his first professional contract and the last thing in his mind should be money. That should be of secondary importance and he should be grateful York City are offering him a contract\". He was ruled out of most of York's pre-season schedule after breaking a bone in his foot in July. Contract talks between Stockdale and York progressed and on 9 August he signed on for the club."]}, {"page": "Chris Porter", "response": ["Chris Porter may refer to:", "*Chris Porter (producer) (active from 1976),  British record producer, engineer and narrator", "*Chris Porter (basketball) (born 1978), American professional basketball player", "*Chris Porter (comedian) (born 1979), American comedian", "*Chris Porter (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u20131915), English amateur football inside forward", "*Chris Porter (footballer, born 1979), English football goalkeeper and coach", "*Chris Porter (footballer, born 1983), English footballer for Crewe Alexandra", "*Chris Porter (ice hockey) (born 1984), Canadian professional ice hockey left winger"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Sunderland A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Chris Porter"]}, {"page": "Chris Porter (footballer born 1979)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Porter (footballer, born 1979)"]}, {"page": "Keith Finch", "response": ["Finch was born in Easington, County Durham. He began his football career under the YTS trainee with Darlington. He made an unexpected debut for the club at the age of 17, in the first round FA Cup-tie against Southport in October 1999, as a half-time replacement for injured goalkeeper Andy Collett. The Sunday Mirror reported that Finch produced \"three super saves\" to help preserve Darlington's one-goal lead. He had to wait more than two years for his first appearance in the Football League, again as substitute for Collett, this time making \"a string of fine saves\" as Darlington beat Lincoln City 2\u20131 in the Third Division. He had a run of games in the first team while Collett was returning to fitness, but when Collett suffered a collapsed lung at the beginning of March, Finch was left as the only fit goalkeeper at the club. The last of Finch's 12 league appearances was in a defeat to York City on 16 March. Later that month, Darlington signed Chris Porter on a pay-as-you-play basis, though with owner George Reynolds unwilling to pay, a fans' website raised money to cover Porter's wages. Finch was one of several players to be released when their contracts expired at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Christopher Ian Porter", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Porter (footballer, born 1979)"]}]}}
