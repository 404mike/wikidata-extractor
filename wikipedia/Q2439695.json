The title was initially conceived to be the flagship showcase for the new Ben Reilly Spider-Man. The initial seven issues (#0\u20136, January\u2013July 1996) were written and pencilled by Jurgens. Jurgens pushed strongly for the restoration of Peter Parker as the true Spider-Man and plans were made to enact this soon, but Bob Harras, the new Editor-in-chief, demanded the story be deferred until after the \"Onslaught\" storyline. Jurgens had by this stage become disillusioned with the immense amount of group planning and constant changes of ideas and directions and took this as the last straw, resigning from the title. In a past interview several years after his Spider-Man run, Jurgens stated that he would like to have another chance on the character, since his run was with the Ben Reilly character during the Spider-Man Clone Saga, and not Peter Parker. Jurgens wrote and pencilled Teen Titans (vol. 2) for its entire two-year, 24-issue run (October 1996 \u2013 September 1998). George P\u00e9rez, the co-creator of The New Teen Titans served as inker for the series' first 15 issues. After 10 years working on the Superman character, Jurgens ended his run as writer with Superman vol. 2 #150 (Nov. 1999). Also in 1999, Jurgens was writer and layout artist for the tabloid-sized graphic novel Superman/Fantastic Four, with finished art by his former The Adventures of Superman inker Art Thibert. Jurgens worked with Marvel Comics as writer on Thor vol. 2 with pencilling by John Romita Jr. and as writer/artist on Captain America vol. 3. In 1995 he was writer/penciller on Solar #46 from Valiant Comics wherein he worked with inker Dick Giordano and with penciller Tom Grindberg joining in with issues #51\u201354 after Jurgens relinquished penciller duties with issue #50. Jurgens was the debut writer of the Tomb Raider: The Series comic book series licensed to Top Cow Productions and Image Comics, which in 1999.
