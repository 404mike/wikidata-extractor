After graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of career. In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory and John Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter. In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the Society of Arcueil, meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists. That year Babbage applied to be professor at the University of Edinburgh, with the recommendation of Pierre Simon Laplace; the post went to William Wallace."]}, {"page": "Ellipse", "response": ["where n!! is the double factorial (extended to negative odd integers by the recurrence relation (2n-1)!! = (2n+1)!!/(2n+1), for n \\le 0).
