Nine of the team appeared in 37 or more league matches with a line up of Cook; Hopkinson, Thresher; McCall, Williams, Burden; Hinshelwood, Tindill, Atyeo, Etheridge and Watkins. Bristol City opened with 6\u20131 and 7\u20134 wins but then lost 0\u20134 at Sheffield United. Atyeo scored a hat-trick in the 7\u20134 win at Barnsley on 27 August 1958 and added a second hat-trick in the 4\u20130 win v Swansea Town on 11 October 1958. This had City fans dreaming of a return to the First Division as the \"Robins\" remained in contention for promotion through to January when 6th in the table before falling away to a final 10th-place finish. Atyeo was top goalscorer again with 26 goals in 40 appearances leading the line as centre forward. Tindill scored 19 goals and Etheridge 13 goals as the inside forwards. In the FA Cup City lost 0\u20131 in a 4th round replay at Blackpool. The 1\u20131 home draw had attracted 42,594 fans to see an ageing Stanley Matthews confronted by the City left back Mike Thresher."]}]}}
