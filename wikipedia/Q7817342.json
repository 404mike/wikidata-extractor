He was six times runner-up in the professional billiards championship, now regarded as the world championship, losing three times to Melbourne Inman in finals from 1912 to 1914, and three times to Tom Newman in the 1921, 1924 and 1925 finals. He made the unofficial world's highest billiards break of 499,135 in 1907 using a cradle cannon technique shortly before it was banned from the sport. In 1927, his prowess with the pendulum stroke led to that also being banned from use in competition.\nHis highest officially-recognised break was 901, which he compiled in 1916. He authored two books, Dainty Billiards: How to play the close cannon game (1925), and his autobiography Cannons and Big Guns (1928). Reece died on 16 October 1953, a week after suffering a stroke.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe Davis", "response": ["In February 1915 a match took place at Chesterfield, organised by Rudge, between Tom Reece, and Willie Smith.

He used the pendulum stroke during this break. It had recently been introduced by Tom Reece. This involved manoeuvring the object balls into the jaws of a corner pocket so they were touching each other, and scoring long runs of close direct cannons by tapping the cue ball lightly across them from one cushion to the other.Davis, Joe (1976).
