When the walls between universes are sealed Pete and Jackie are sent to the parallel universe for safety; he later returns to rescue Rose from falling into the breach. In the episode's epilogue, it is stated that Jackie is pregnant with his child. Pete does not return with his on screen family in the series four final\u00e9 but it is mentioned that he had been looking after his and Jackie's son, Tony.", "Simon Pegg, who ultimately played the Editor in \"The Long Game\", was reported as being in line to play Pete, before having to pass on the episode. Paul Cornell, who wrote the episode \"Father's Day\" states that he based the character of Pete on his own father, who attempted many different jobs one of which was, like Pete, selling health drinks. In the episode after assuming responsibility for the destructive time paradox, Pete assures Rose \"I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault\". This line was taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. An item of discussion between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose from falling into the void in second series finale \"Doomsday\"; executive producer's Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Noel Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise that he had accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter."]}, {"page": "John Barrowman", "response": ["Following accusations of sexual harassment from 20 women against fellow Doctor Who star Noel Clarke in April 2021, a video from a 2015 science-fiction convention surfaced wherein Clarke and co-stars Camille Coduri and Annette Badland discuss the episode \"Boom Town,\" which was filmed in February 2005, and reference Barrowman exposing himself.
