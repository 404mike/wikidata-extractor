Edward Mann Langley, reviewing the 1901 edition, suggested that its content went well beyond what should be covered in a standard geometry course. And in their own textbook on geometry using paper-folding exercises, The First Book of Geometry (1905), Grace Chisholm Young and William Henry Young heavily criticized Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding, writing that it is \"too difficult for a child, and too infantile for a grown person\". However, reviewing the 1966 Dover edition, mathematics educator Pamela Liebeck called it \"remarkably relevant\" to the discovery learning techniques for geometry instruction of the time, and in 2016 computational origami expert Tetsuo Ida, introducing an attempt to formalize the mathematics of the book, wrote \"After 123 years, the significance of the book remains.\""]}]}}
