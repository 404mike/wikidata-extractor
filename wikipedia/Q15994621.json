One of these, after the author's death, happened to fall into Dr. Mead's hands\u00a0...\" In Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire III p.\u00a099 Gibbon made reference to Burnet's De Statu Mortuorum et Resurgentium noting that Burnet \"exposes the inconveniences which must arise\", if souls \"possess a more active and sensible existence\". Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol and Dean of St. Paul's, criticised Gibbon and claimed that Burnet's views were exactly the opposite.The gentleman's magazine, and historical chronicle, 87  \"The following remarks were written by Bp. Newton at the age of 78 : \"Some books were published in 1781, which employed some of the Bishop's leisure hours in his rural retreat and during his illness. Mr. Gibbon's History of the Decline and fall\u00a0... Mr. Gibbon has the following note: \"Burnet De statu mortuorum (56\u201384) collects the opinions of the fathers, as far as they assert the sleep or repose of human souls till the day of judgment. He afterward exposes (pp. 91, &c.) the inconveniences which must arise, if they possessed a more1 active and sensible existence. Who would not from hence infer that Dr. B. was an advocate for the sleep or and insensible existence of the soul after death? Whereas his doctrine is directly the contrary. He has employed some chapters in treating of the state of human souls in the interval between death and the resurrection; and after various proofs from reason, from scripture, and the Fathers, his conclusions are, that human souls exist after their separation from the body, that they are in a good or evil state according to their good or ill behaviour, but that neither their happiness nor their misery will be complete and perfect before the day of judgment.\""]}, {"page": "John Martin", "response": ["John Martin may refer to:", "*John Martin (businessman) (1820\u20131905), American lumberman
