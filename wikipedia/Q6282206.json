He was articled to the engraver Joseph Collyer the younger, an exacting master who required steady application from his pupil - as a result, Heath acquired a great mechanical skill in his art. His earliest engravings were of portraits in the collected edition of Horace Walpole's works. He was subsequently employed to engrave Thomas Stothard's designs for Harrison's The Novelist's MagazineThe Novelist's Magazine, Volume 1 (Harrison & Co. 1780). and Bell's Poets of Great Britain, and the taste and dexterity with which he rendered these small illustrations brought this style of illustration into great popularity. He made many engravings after artists such as Stothard, Smirke, and others, and these were to be found in publications such as: Sharpe's British Classics, the Lady's Poetical Magazine,The Lady's poetical magazine, volume 1 (London Harrison, 1781).

This version belongs to British artist and engraver Joseph Collyer (1748 \u20131827).  In 1829 Francesco Tassi claimed that Collyer had been commissioned to make the engraving of \"portrait Benvenuto Cellini\" by the British publisher \"Nugent\". Looking for the correct face of Benvenuto, the English artist relied on Cellini's image in Vasari's tondo.  But Collyer simply failed to properly identify the sculptor among the other personalities on the fresco. He erroneously thought that Cellini was the man placed at the very bottom of the tondo. Collyer's Benvenuto was the man shown talking to Francesco di Ser Jacopo, and looking over his shoulder towards the viewer.\u0421ellini, Benvenuto \"Vita di Benvenuto Cellini\", orefice e scultore fiorentino, scritta da lui medesimo, restituita alla lezione originale sul manoscritto poirot ora laurenziano ed arricchita d\u2019illustrazioni e documenti inediti dal dottor Francesco Tassi, vol.
