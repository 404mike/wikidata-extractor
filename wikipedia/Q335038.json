In the first government of Margaret Thatcher, he played a major role in negotiating the Lancaster House Agreement that ended the racial conflict in Rhodesia and enabled the creation of Zimbabwe.\nCarrington had been Foreign Secretary in 1982 when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. He took full responsibility for the failure to foresee this and resigned. As NATO secretary general, he helped prevent a war between Greece and Turkey during the 1987 Aegean crisis.Following the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, Carrington was created a life peer as Baron Carington of Upton.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 6", "response": ["*1919 \u2013 Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington, English army officer and politician, 6th Secretary General of NATO (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "2018", "response": ["** Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington, English politician, 6th Secretary General of NATO (b. 1919)"]}, {"page": "Bilderberg meeting", "response": ["| 120px|Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington", "| Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington  (1919\u20132018)"]}]}}
