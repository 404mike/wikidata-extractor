The very idea of ultrasound and its benefits had to be disseminated to the medical community. In 1959, a Swedish obstetrician Bertil Sund\u00e9n of Lund University, Sweden visited Glasgow on a quest to find a subject for his MD thesis. Glasgow University had established links with Lund University since the time of John Martin Munro Kerr. Lars Leksell of Lund has been experimenting with Ultrasound since the 1950s and had been using a Kelvin and Hughes supersonic detector to experiment with. Leksell's work had been well known to obstetrics and gynaecology professor Alf Sj\u00f6vall, who was friends with Donald and more importantly, knew his work. It was Sj\u00f6vall who decided to send Sund\u00e9n to Glasgow. The outcome of the visit was that Sund\u00e9n wanted to reproduce Donald's work from scratch. Despite the fact that the automatic scanner was almost completed, Sund\u00e9n wanted an exact copy of the machine which Donald had used to produce his first publications, i.e. bed table scanner. The result was an order for a new ultrasound machine costing \u00a32500. This was the first direct-contact scanning machine built anywhere in the world and was a hybrid between the manually operated bed-table machine and the automatic scanner. This was a new prototype and became the basis for the Diasonograph that became the first commercially produced machine in 1965."]}, {"page": "Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Glasgow)", "response": ["* John Martin Munro Kerr MD LLD (1927)"]}, {"page": "Samuel James Cameron", "response": ["Sam Cameron graduated from the University of Glasgow MB Ch.B, with commendation, in 1901.
