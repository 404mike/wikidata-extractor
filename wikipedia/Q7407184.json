The opening of the Majestic, Masque, and Royale signified the westward extension of the traditional Broadway theater district, as well as an expansion of the Chanins' theatrical developments. Each of the Chanin theaters was intended for a different purpose: the 1,800-seat Majestic for \"revues and light operas\", the 1,200-seat Royale for \"musical comedies\", and the 800-seat Masque for \"intimate\" plays. By developing a small, medium, and large theater concurrently, the Chanins were able to lower their development costs. Burns Mantle wrote for the New York Daily News that the Royale had \"a handsome auditorium with a Willy Pogany interior, well proportioned stage, and the established atmosphere of a hospitable and well-run theatre\".

The plan was to retire the characters of Dreyfus, Cato, Francois, and Professor August Balls. Edwards  told the LA Times that the series would change geographically. NYPD Lt. Palmyra would have continued as Sleigh's Dreyfus-type boss character and Charlie (the hip black cop) would have been a role similar to Francois. The series would probably have resembled the Police Academy movies more than the classic Pink Panther films. MGM wanted to continue with a cheaper version of the series. Edwards wanted the series to continue as comedy's answer to James Bond. Edwards would not have directed the later Wass films (Terry Marcel was slated to helm the next one) and Edwards' son, Geoffrey Edwards and Sam Bernard would have scripted. Edwards' co-producer, Tony Adams planned to produce one Panther film every three years in order to finance smaller projects, depending on how the movie would perform. After the critical and financial failure of this film, all of these plans were promptly abandoned."]}, {"page": "Shubert Theatre (Broadway)", "response": ["The Forbes-Robertson Repertory Company's productions included Shakespeare plays,;  as well as other works such as George Bernard Shaw's play Caesar and Cleopatra.

Among theatrical critics, Jack Lait referred to the Music Box as the \"daintiest theatre in America\" in Variety magazine.
