He played more than 100 games in the Football League for each of his four clubs, namely Chelsea, Birmingham City, Brighton & Hove Albion and Peterborough United. He won six caps for England at under-23 level.Murray started his career with Chelsea, and was an important figure in manager Tommy Docherty's \"Diamonds\" side of the mid-1960s, which won the League Cup in 1965 and narrowly missed out on FA Cup and League success. He made 183 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 44 goals.\nMurray, along with several teammates, fell out with Docherty and was transferred to Birmingham City in 1966, where he linked up with ex-Chelsea teammate, Barry Bridges.

With three games left to play they were also in with an outside chance of overtaking Manchester United and Leeds United to win the league title, but Chelsea lost the first of these games 2\u20130 to Liverpool at Anfield. Docherty reversed his decision to allow the players a night out after the game, but Venables and seven other players (George Graham, Barry Bridges, John Hollins, Marvin Hinton, Eddie McCreadie, Joe Fascione, and Bert Murray) broke curfew and went out for a brief night out. Upon their return to the team hotel Docherty suspended all eight players for the remainder of the season. Chelsea then lost 6\u20132 to Burnley, before Docherty reinstated the players for a final day defeat to Blackpool. Venables never forgave Docherty for the punishment, describing it as \"crass, stupid and self-defeating\".

He made his debut in May 1966 during a 2\u20130 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup win over FC Barcelona. On his league debut the following season against West Ham United, Cooke waltzed past England's World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore en route to scoring the winner for Chelsea. Cooke took the place of Bert Murray on the right wing as several players were replaced owing to a growing rift between Docherty and his players. He proved a versatile player when the post World Cup tactics limited the use of wingers and he was often played in a deeper right midfield position behind Tommy Baldwin who had replaced George Graham in a direct swap between Chelsea and Arsenal. His debut season saw Chelsea reach the FA Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur (Cooke's cross had created Tony Hateley's winner for Chelsea in the semi-final against Leeds United).
