Jones was extremely abusive, at one point breaking his hand on Pallenberg\u2019s face. In 1967, Anita left Brian for his bandmate Keith Richards. This added to tensions between Brian and Keith.  Brian had subsequent relationships with Suki Potier, and Swedish model Anna Wohlin, as well as a short relationship in 1968 with infamous American model and psychedelic It Girl Donyale Luna who lived in London and appeared with him in the Stone's 1968 'Rock n Roll Circus,' several months before his death.
