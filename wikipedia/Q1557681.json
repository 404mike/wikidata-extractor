He is often seen as one of the pioneers of the British industrial music scene, alongside bands such as Throbbing Gristle, Monte Cazazza and Cabaret Voltaire, although in his music he has explored a wide range of styles, including free-form improvisation, folk, and even Latin American dance rhythms.Nurse with Wound, originally a three-piece ensemble, is Stapleton's main outlet for his musical work, occasionally in collaboration with other musicians such as Foetus or William Bennett (of Whitehouse). He has also appeared on records by other artists and worked as a producer. He runs the United Dairies record label, which apart from the NWW output released records by Current 93, the Lemon Kittens and Volcano the Bear, as well as krautrock and several experimental artists. Stapleton is also a graphic artist and painter, and has designed album sleeves and book covers.Under the name \"Babs Santini\", Stapleton has created the artwork for most of the Nurse with Wound recordings, as well as for other artists, such as Coil, the Legendary Pink Dots and Current 93.Stapleton lives with his long term partner and wife Sarah Redpath, the family lives in County Clare, Ireland, on a piece of land with houses and caravans hand-built and decorated by Stapleton.

In addition, Nothing also planned to re-issue the first two Coil albums, Scatology and Horse Rotorvator.  However, the rights to these albums became caught up in a dispute between Coil and their former label, Some Bizzare Records.  John Balance recalled in 1999, \"We have no news over Nothing releasing Horse Rotorvator and Scatology, because we gave them it about 5 years ago and had it legally able to be released in the U.S., but Nothing's lawyers were unhappy with a slightly less than watertight legal situation, so didn't go ahead.\"  Balance would go on to claim that Some Bizzare label owner Stephen \"Stevo\" Pearce initially agreed to the Nothing re-issues, before later demanding more money, stating,  \"Since that, that fucking arsehole  Stevo Pearce has reared his very unpleasant head again and asked Nothing for more money and generally thrown a spanner in the works.

These people are proficient in various related musical styles from dark ambient to industrial noise music. They sometimes acquired knowledge from each other when working together, thus it is easy to see that in the music of David Tibet/Current 93, there are mainly two important genres of underground industrial music including ambient music and dark industrial. These mixed styles of music represents the development of the industrial noise music.
