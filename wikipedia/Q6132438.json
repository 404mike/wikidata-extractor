He was born at Bonnytoun, Linlithgow, Scotland, the son of a whisky distiller. He arrived in Hobsons Bay, Port Phillip, Australia on 2 May 1840 with his wife Joan Anderson Park, niece of Mungo Park.  He tried dairy farming in the Yarra valley for a time but moved to broader pastures in the Port Fairy district in 1844.  For the next 22 years Dawson was in partnership in a cattle and sheep station, \"Cox's Heifer Station\" later named Kangatong, some 10 miles east of Macarthur.  \nIn 1866 he left the district and settled for a while near Melbourne, but later moved back to the Camperdown area living at Wuurung Farm on the edge of Lake Bullen Merri, where he became Local Guardian of the Aborigines in 1876.  In 1882, he returned from a trip home to Linlithgow to find that the last survivor of the Djargurd Wurrung, Wombeetch Puyuun, had died and was buried outside the Camperdown cemetery.  After an unsuccessful appeal for public support to finance a memorial in the cemetery he had a granite obelisk erected at his own expense and had Wombeetch Puyuun's remains reburied at its foot.  The obelisk has two dates, 1840 and 1883, which mark the mere 43 years it took for white settlement to displace the Djargurd wurrung from the Camperdown area.\nJames Dawson and his daughter, Isabella Park Taylor (1843\u20131929), shared a deep interest in Aboriginal civilisation.  They used their years at Kangatong to study the languages and cultures of the indigenous peoples of the volcanic plains, and to which in 1881, he published the work Australian aborigines: the languages and customs of several tribes of aborigines in the western district of Victoria, Australia, and a second edition in 1900. He vigorously defended Aboriginal interests against government officials, politicians, his fellow squatters and others, a crusade that he kept up until his death in 1900 at Camperdown at the age of 93.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* James Dawson (1806\u20131900), prominent champion of Australian Aborigines' interests"]}, {"page": "Infanticide", "response": ["James Dawson wrote a passage about infanticide among Indigenous people in the western district of Victoria, which stated that \"Twins are as common among them as among Europeans; but as food is occasionally very scarce, and a large family troublesome to move about, it is lawful and customary to destroy the weakest twin child, irrespective of sex."]}, {"page": "1900", "response": ["* April 19 \u2013 James Dawson, Australian activist (b. 1806) "]}, {"page": "1806", "response": ["* July 5 \u2013 James Dawson, Aboriginal Guardian (d. 1900)"]}, {"page": "Terang", "response": ["The semi-nomadic Kirrae Wuurong clans originally inhabited the area between Mount Emu Creek and the Hopkins River, and much of their language was recorded by a Scottish squatter, James Dawson.Girai Wurrung"]}, {"page": "Tom Wills", "response": ["Since the 1980s, it has been suggested that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, Marngrook, as a child growing up in the Grampians among the Djab wurrung, and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. The theory has provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed \"football's history wars\". In her essay \"A Seductive Myth\", published in the AFL's The Australian Game of Football Since 1858 (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed link an \"emotional belief\" lacking \"any intellectual credibility\". She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew up. Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, an interview has been found with a Mukjarrawaint man who recalls playing Marngrook in the Grampians. Also, in his first-hand account of Aboriginal games, James Dawson, an Aboriginal rights activist, records the Djab wurrung word for football as \"Min'gorm\". De Moore therefore argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, \"or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a game\". That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best."]}, {"page": "Marn Grook", "response": ["James Dawson, in his 1881 book titled Australian Aborigines, described a game, which he referred to as 'football', where the players of two teams kick around a ball made of possum fur.
