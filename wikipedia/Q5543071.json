He also made four appearances for the Welsh national team.\nBorn in Chirk, Denbighshire, Owen began his career with his local team, Chirk, before joining Newton Heath in January 1889. At the time of his signing, he was one of three Owens at the club, the other two being brothers Jack and William Owen. Owen played for Newton Heath for 1\u00bd seasons, during which time he made 19 competitive appearances and scored five goals. In June 1890, Owen was transferred to West Manchester, before moving back to Chirk the following season. Two years with Druids followed, before he returned to Chirk for the final time in 1895. He retired from professional football in 1896, at the age of 31.\nOwen also made four appearances for the Welsh national team. He made his debut for Wales while still with Chirk on 10 March 1888 in a British Home Championship match against Scotland; Wales lost the match 5\u20131. His two Wales caps won as a Newton Heath player came in the 1889 British Home Championship, in which he played in Wales' last two games: a 0\u20130 draw with Scotland and a 3\u20131 win over Ireland. Owen had to wait a further three years for his final Wales appearance, a match in which he scored his only goals for his country: a hat-trick in a 4\u20133 loss to Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chirk", "response": ["* George Owen, Welsh international footballer"]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*29 January \u2013 George Owen, footballer, 56"]}, {"page": "1865 in Wales", "response": ["**George Owen, footballer (died 1922)"]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Newton Heath LYR F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| George Owen"]}, {"page": "George Owen", "response": ["George Owen may refer to:", "*George Owen (physician) (1499\u20131558), royal physician", "*George Owen of Henllys (1552\u20131613), Welsh antiquarian, author, and naturalist", "*George Owen (herald) (died 1665), Welsh officer of arms, son of George Owen of Henllys ", "*George Owen (ice hockey) (1901\u20131986), ice hockey defenseman", "*George Owen (footballer) (1865\u20131922), Welsh footballer", "*George Owen (cyclist) (1893\u2013?), British cyclist", "*George Owens (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Wales national football team results (1876\u20131899)", "response": ["|1892\u201393 British Home Championship|| George Owen (2), William Owen || 3,000 "]}, {"page": "T.

On 15 March, he filled in at right half for the absent Roger Doughty, before an extended run on the left side of the forward line that lasted until the end of the season, filling in first for George Owen for seven games at inside left, then for Edgar Wilson for one game at outside left. During that run of eight games, he scored three goals, the first in a 9\u20131 home win over Small Heath on 7 April, then in a 2\u20131 home win over Birmingham St George's on 19 April and a 2\u20131 home defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on 26 April. He would have had a further two goals from a home match against Grimsby Town on 4 January, but the match was ordered to be replayed due to the poor state of the pitch. On 3 May, he played at inside right in the final of the Manchester Cup against Royton at Brooke's Bar, and scored a hat-trick as Newton Heath won 5\u20132, their fourth Manchester Cup title."]}]}}
