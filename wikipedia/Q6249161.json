Bathing was introduced in the 1680s at a time when hydrotherapy was enjoying a recrudescence in popularity. \"Cold bathing\", opined John Monro, Bethlem physician for 40 years from 1751, \"has in general an excellent effect\";Quoted in  and remained much in vogue as a treatment throughout the eighteenth century. By the early nineteenth century, bathing was routine for all patients of sufficient hardiness from summer \"to the setting-in of the cold weather\". Spring signalled recourse to the traditional armamentarium; from then until the end of summer Bethlem's \"Mad Physick\" reigned supreme as all patients, barring those deemed incurable, could expect to be bled and blistered and then dosed with emetics and purgatives. Indiscriminately applied, these curative measures were administered with the most cursory physical examination, if any, and with sufficient excess to risk not only health but also life. Such was the violence of the standard medical course, \"involving voiding of the bowels, vomiting, scarification, sores and bruises,\" that patients were regularly discharged or refused admission if they were deemed unfit to survive the physical onslaught.", "The reigning medical ethos was the subject of public debate in the mid-eighteenth century when a paper war erupted between John Monro and his rival William Battie, physician to the reformist St Luke's Asylum of London, founded in 1751. The Bethlem Governors, who had presided over the only public asylum in Britain until the early eighteenth century, looked upon St Luke's as an upstart institution and Battie, formerly a Governor at Bethlem, as traitorous. In 1758 Battie published his Treatise on Madness which castigated Bethlem as archaic and outmoded, uncaring of its patients and founded upon a despairing medical system whose therapeutic transactions were both injudicious and unnecessarily violent. In contrast, Battie presented St Luke's as a progressive and innovative hospital, oriented towards the possibility of cure and scientific in approach.;  Monro responded promptly, publishing Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness in the same year."]}, {"page": "William Battie", "response": ["Battie's treatise elicited a response from John Monro, the physician to Bethlem Hospital, who saw it as an attack on his father, who had preceded him, and himself.
