He formerly wrote a column in National Review before moving to a staff position at the website VDARE, where he continues to work. He has also written for the New English Review.  His columns cover a broad range of political-cultural topics, including immigration, China, history, mathematics, and race. Derbyshire's 1996 novel Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream was a New York Times \"Notable Book of the Year\". His 2004 non-fiction book Prime Obsession won the Mathematical Association of America's inaugural Euler Book Prize. A political book, We Are Doomed: Reclaiming Conservative Pessimism, was released in September 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Grothendieck", "response": ["In 1991, Grothendieck moved to a new address which he did not provide to his previous contacts in the mathematical community.
