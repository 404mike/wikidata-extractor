Published in July 1947 to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. The area was proposed to become a Conservation Area, alongside 51 others, for its \"outstanding landscape beauty\" and home to \"great scientific interest\", which was deemed worthy of protection and management through statutory designation. This designation eventually became \"Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\", however the eventual designation for the area was much smaller than originally proposed, only covering most of the Clwydian Range."]}]}}
