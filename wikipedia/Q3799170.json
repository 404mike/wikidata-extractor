Nevertheless, as a direct result of the failings of the Dieppe Raid, the British made several innovations, most notably Hobart's Funnies \u2013 specialised armoured vehicles which, in the course of the Normandy Landings, undoubtedly saved many lives on those three beachheads upon which Commonwealth soldiers were landing (Gold Beach, Juno Beach and Sword Beach)."]}, {"page": "Falklands War", "response": ["By dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations.

During the conflict, British forces fired 95 missiles, of which approximately half suffered failures of various kinds, and only 9 managed to destroy their targets and all of these were slow flying planes and helicopters.

There was also UN pressure for a cease-fire and the UK government position was that the taking of the Darwin\u2013Goose Green isthmus was imperative before any such cease-fire decision as it would allow British forces to control access to the entire Lafonia and thus a significant portion of East Falkland.
