Hales was born in Ballinadee, County Cork as John Hales, son of farmer Robert Hales and Margaret Fitzgerald. He and his brothers Tom, Donal and Robert, were involved in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence.At the 1921 elections Hales was elected to the Second D\u00e1il as a Sinn F\u00e9in member for the Cork Mid, North, South, South East and West constituency.At the 1922 general election, he was elected to the Third D\u00e1il as a pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the same constituency. He received 4374 first preference votes (7.98%). Shortly afterwards, the Irish Civil War broke out between the pro-Treaty faction, who were in favour of setting up the Irish Free State and the anti-Treaty faction, who would not accept the abolition of the Irish Republic.On 7 December 1922, Hales was killed by anti-Treaty IRA men as he left the D\u00e1il. Another TD, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, was also shot and badly wounded in the incident. His killing was in reprisal for the Free State's execution of anti-treaty prisoners. In revenge for Hales' killing, four republican leaders (Joe McKelvey, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows and Richard Barrett were executed on the next day - 8 December 1922). See Executions during the Irish Civil War.According to information passed on to playwright Ulick O'Connor, an anti-Treaty IRA volunteer named Owen Donnelly of Glasnevin was responsible for the killing of Hales. Se\u00e1n Caffrey, an anti-treaty intelligence officer told O'Connor that Donnelly had not been ordered to shoot Hales specifically but was following the general order issued by Liam Lynch to shoot TDs or senators if they could.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Death squad", "response": ["After TD Sean Hales was assassinated, the D\u00e1il began to treat the civil war as a state of emergency. They voted to retaliate by summarily executing four captured members of IRA Executive -- Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey. After the motion passed, all four men were executed by firing squad on December 8, 1922. During the conflict, at least 73 other captured IRA men were treated in the same fashion\u2014some following court martial, others without trial. There are no conclusive figures for the number of unofficial executions of captured IRA insurgents, but Republican officer Todd Andrews estimated 153.Todd Andrews, Dublin Made Me, p269 (see Executions during the Irish Civil War)."]}, {"page": "History of Dublin", "response": ["After some prevarication and after Winston Churchill had actually ordered British troops to assault the rebels, Collins decided he had to act and borrowed British artillery to shell the republicans in the Four Courts. They surrendered after a two-day (28\u201330 June 1922) artillery bombardment by Free State troops but some of their IRA comrades occupied O'Connell Street, which saw street fighting for another week before the Free State Army secured the capital. (See Battle of Dublin). Over 60 combatants were killed in the fighting, including senior republican Cathal Brugha. About 250 civilians are also thought to have been killed or injured, but the total has never been accurately counted. Oscar Traynor conducted some guerrilla operations south of the city until his capture in late July 1922. Ernie O'Malley, the republican commander for the province of Leinster was captured after a shootout in the Ballsbridge area in November 1922. On 6 December 1922, the IRA assassinated Sean Hales a member of Parliament as he was leaving Leinster House in Dublin city centre, in reprisal for the executions of their prisoners by the Free State. The following day, the four leaders of the republicans in the Four Courts (Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Dick Barret, and Joe McKelvey) were executed in revenge. Dublin was relatively quiet thereafter, although guerrilla war raged in the provinces. The new Free State government eventually suppressed this insurrection by mid-1923. In April, Frank Aiken, IRA chief of staff, ordered the anti-treaty forces to dump their arms and go home. The civil war left a permanent strain of bitterness in Irish politics that did much to sour the achievement of national independence."]}, {"page": "Fion\u00e1n Lynch", "response": ["On 6 December 1922, the day the Irish Free State came into being, two members of its legislature were shot by the Irregulars, one of whom, Sean Hales, was killed, as part of a retaliatory policy for the military court executions that had started a few weeks earlier."]}, {"page": "Liam Lynch (Irish republican)", "response": ["Lynch then issued his orders, which were acted upon by IRA men, who killed TD Sean Hales and wounded another TD outside the D\u00e1il. In reprisal, the Free State immediately shot four republican leaders, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Dick Barrett and Joe McKelvey. This led to a cycle of atrocities on both sides, including the Free State official execution of 77 republican prisoners and \"unofficial\" killing of roughly 150 other captured republicans. Lynch's men for their part launched a concerted campaign against the homes of Free State members of parliament."]}, {"page": "James Bernard, 4th Earl of Bandon", "response": ["The family seat, Castle Bernard, near Bandon, County Cork, was one of the great houses burned during the Anglo-Irish War in the early 1920s by the Irish Republican Army under Sean Hales on 21 June 1921.

In September special emergency legislation came into effect under which military tribunals were empowered to pass death sentences. The head of the anti-Treaty forces, Liam Lynch, responded with an announcement that Free State TDs and Senators who had voted for the legislation would be targeted. A number of members of the Oireachtas were attacked, TD Sean Hales was killed and the property of parliamentarians burnt. In addition IRA men around the country burned many of the stately homes of the old Protestant Anglo-Irish landed class\u2014a policy motivated by both class antagonism and nationalist resentment against a class traditionally seen as \"pro-British\". The Free State Government, for its part, officially executed 77 anti-Treaty prisoners. Government forces also carried out a number of atrocities against prisoners. This was particularly pronounced in Kerry, where the fighting was most bitter. On at least three occasions in March 1923, IRA prisoners were massacred with land mines in reprisal for the killing of Free State soldiers. Ironically, the men accused of these war crimes were mostly from the Dublin Guard, themselves IRA veterans from 1919\u201321.

The execution order was signed by Kevin O'Higgins. O'Connor had been best man at his wedding on 27 October 1921. Their deaths remain a symbol of the bitterness and division of the Irish Civil War. O'Connor, one of 77 republicans executed by the Provisional Government, is seen as a martyr by the Republican movement in Ireland."]}, {"page": "Executions during the Irish Civil War", "response": ["On 7 December, Anti-Treaty IRA gunmen shot two TDs, Sean Hales and P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, in Dublin as they were on their way to the D\u00e1il. Hales was killed and O'M\u00e1ille was badly wounded. After an emergency cabinet meeting, the Free State government decided on the retaliatory executions of four prominent Republicans (one from each province). Accordingly, on 8 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four members of the IRA Army Executive, who had been in jail since the first week of the war - Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey - were executed in revenge. O'Connor and Mellows particularly were revered heroes of the War of Independence. This was arguably an unlawful act, as the four Republicans had been captured before the D\u00e1il passed the legislation authorising executions. Later on the same day the D\u00e1il debated the executions and retrospectively approved them by a vote of 39-14.See  One of the poignant aspects of the incident was that O'Connor and Kevin O'Higgins were formerly close friends, and O'Connor had been best man at O'Higgins' wedding just a few months previously. Historian Michael Hopkinson reports that Richard Mulcahy had pressed for the executions and that Kevin O'Higgins was the last member of cabinet to give his consent.", "Sean Hales was the only TD to be killed in the war. However, Republicans continued to burn the homes of elected representatives in reprisal for executions of their men. On 10 December, the house of TD Se\u00e1n McGarry was burned down, killing his seven-year-old son whom the attackers had not realised was inside. Homes of senators were among the 199 houses burned or destroyed by the IRA in the war. In February 1923, Kevin O'Higgins' elderly father was murdered by Republicans at the family home in Stradbally. The President of the Executive Council W. T. Cosgrave's home was burned and his uncle was assassinated."]}]}}
