Hales was born in Ballinadee, County Cork as John Hales, son of farmer Robert Hales and Margaret Fitzgerald. He and his brothers Tom, Donal and Robert, were involved in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence.At the 1921 elections Hales was elected to the Second D\u00e1il as a Sinn F\u00e9in member for the Cork Mid, North, South, South East and West constituency.At the 1922 general election, he was elected to the Third D\u00e1il as a pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the same constituency. He received 4374 first preference votes (7.98%). Shortly afterwards, the Irish Civil War broke out between the pro-Treaty faction, who were in favour of setting up the Irish Free State and the anti-Treaty faction, who would not accept the abolition of the Irish Republic.On 7 December 1922, Hales was killed by anti-Treaty IRA men as he left the D\u00e1il. Another TD, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, was also shot and badly wounded in the incident. His killing was in reprisal for the Free State's execution of anti-treaty prisoners. In revenge for Hales' killing, four republican leaders (Joe McKelvey, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows and Richard Barrett were executed on the next day - 8 December 1922). See Executions during the Irish Civil War.According to information passed on to playwright Ulick O'Connor, an anti-Treaty IRA volunteer named Owen Donnelly of Glasnevin was responsible for the killing of Hales. Se\u00e1n Caffrey, an anti-treaty intelligence officer told O'Connor that Donnelly had not been ordered to shoot Hales specifically but was following the general order issued by Liam Lynch to shoot TDs or senators if they could.", "link_mentions": {}}}
