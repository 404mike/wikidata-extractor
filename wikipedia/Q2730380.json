His career began in the 1760s before first-class statistics began to be recorded and his known first-class career spans the 1772 to 1783 seasons.\nHe has often been confused with his namesake who played for Surrey at the same time.  Although Wood is credited with 12 first-class appearances by CricketArchive, there are only 10 which can definitely be attributed to him.  Using the data in Scores and Biographies, there were 12 matches in which a player known only as \"Wood\" took part, with Wood of Surrey specifically recorded in 13.According to John Nyren, Wood of Kent was a \"change bowler who was tall, stout, bony and a very good general player\".  According to H T Waghorn, he suffered a serious knee injury in 1773 and there were fears of amputation being necessary.  However, he was playing again in 1774 so things cannot have been as bad as they first seemed.\nThe first time a John Wood is mentioned in the sources is when one plays for Caterham against Hambledon in 1769.  This was probably the Surrey-based player.  In the same season, a player called Wood played for the Duke of Dorset's XI against Wrotham in the minor match that featured John Minshull's century.  Given Dorset's strong Kent connection, this was probably John Wood of Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Wood", "response": ["John Wood may refer to:", "* John Wood, the Elder (1704\u20131754), English architect", "* John Wood, the Younger (1728\u20131782) architect", "* John Wood (professor) (c.1775\u20131822), American professor of mathematics", "* John Wood (design theorist) (born 1945), British professor of design ", "* John Wood (activist) (born 1964), education activist, marketing director at Microsoft", "* John Wood (actor, born 1909), Australian actor", "* John Wood (actor, born 1946), Australian actor who appeared in the police drama Blue Heelers", "* John Wood (English actor) (1930\u20132011), Shakespearean actor", "* Mrs. John Wood (1831\u20131915), British actor", "* John Wood, birth name of actor John Fortune", "* John Wood (artist) (1922\u20132012), American artist", "* John Wood (director) (1925\u20132015), pseudonym of Spanish director Juan Bosch", "* John Wood (poet) (born 1947), American poet and historian of photography", "* John Wood (record producer), English record producer", "* John Wood (painter) (1801\u20131870), English history and portrait painter, see Thomas Stothard", "* John Atwood (colonial administrator) (1576\u20131644), also known as John Wood, Assistant Governor of the Plymouth Colony", "* John Wood (congressman) (1816\u20131898), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "* John Wood (Florida politician) (born 1952), member of the Florida House of Representatives", "* John Wood (governor) (1798\u20131880), governor of Illinois", "* John Wood (MP for Ipswich), English MP for Ipswich in 1420", "* John Wood (died 1458), English MP for Worcester and Worcestershire", "* John Wood I of Keele, English MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme", "* John Wood II of Keele, English MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme", "* Sir John Wood (speaker) (died 1484), English MP and Speaker of the House of Commons", "* John Wood (Scottish courtier) (died 1570), Secretary to Regent Moray", "* John Wood (MP for Bossiney) (died 1623), English MP for Bossiney", "* John Wood (Isle of Man governor), Governor of the Isle of Man, 1761\u20131777", "* John Wood (MP for Preston) (1789\u20131856), British MP for Preston", "* John Wood (civil servant, born 1790) (1790\u20131856), British civil servant", "* Sir John Wood, 1st Baronet (1857\u20131951), British Member of Parliament", "* Sir John Wood (civil servant, born 1870) (1870\u20131933), civil servant in the Indian Civil Service", "* John Wood (Australian politician) (1829\u20131914), Victorian and Tasmanian Legislative Assemblies", "* John Wood (diplomat) (born 1944), New Zealand diplomat", "* John Wood (surgeon) (1825\u20131891), British surgeon at King's College Hospital", "* John Wood (Surrey cricketer, born 1744) (1744\u20131793), English cricketer", "* John Wood (Kent cricketer, born 1745) (1745\u20131816), English cricketer", "* John Wood (New Zealand cricketer) (1839\u20131909), New Zealand cricketer", "* John Wood (Australian cricketer) (1865\u20131928), Australian cricketer", "* John Wood (civil servant, born 1870) (1870\u20131933), English cricketer", "* John Wood (cricketer, born 1970), English cricketer", "* John Wood (footballer, born 1880) (1880\u20131916), English footballer", "* John Wood (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131959), English footballer", "* John Wood (footballer, born 1948), English footballer", "* John Wood (Scottish footballer) (1894\u20131971), Scottish forward", "* John Wood (American football) (born 1951), American football player", "* Jackie Wood (1919\u20131993), real name Edward John Wood, footballer", "* John Wood (baseball) (1872\u20131929), baseball player", "* John Wood (canoeist) (1950\u20132013), Canadian Olympic flatwater canoer", "* John Wood (racing driver) (born 1952), CART driver", "* John Wood (rugby league) (born 1956), Great Britain, and Leigh", "* John Wood (millowner) (1758\u2013?), created the Howard Town Mills complex in Glossop, England", "* John Wood (Bradford manufacturer) (1793\u20131871), English industrialist and factory reformer", "* John Wood (explorer) (1812\u20131871), Scottish explorer of central Asia", "* John Wood (photographer) (dates unknown), Civil War photographer for Union Army", "* John Wood, subject of Finders Keepers (2015 film)", "*John Woods (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers to 1771", "response": ["| Only definite reference is in 1761 but probably played in 1759 for All-England.
