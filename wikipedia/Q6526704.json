The film marks Jarrett's feature film debut, and was based upon his own experiences living in Taiwan and working as kindergarten teachers from 1999 to 2001. The events in the movie take place when a fellow ex-pat dies.

Their efforts are complicated by having to keep Jed's body on ice in the bed of their pickup truck while transporting it all over Taiwan.", "* Leonora Moore as Nikita (as Leonora Lim)", "Film Business Asia compared the film to others that had been filmed along Taiwan's scenic East Coast Highway, but noted that the film was \"basically a US indie that just happens to be set in East Asia\", and that rather than being an integral part of the film, \"the landscape and locals are there for decoration.\" They offered though, that despite a lack of engagement with the local culture, the film did \"convey a genuine sense of place from an outsider's perspective,\" and that the film had good production values, and well-composed cinematography and performances.  Taipei Times both interviewed Mark Jarrett and made note of the time he had spent in Taiwan, writing that the film is \"a captivating and visually stunning indie film that ponders the idea of death\".  Twitch Film wrote that while \"performance are all over the map\", the onscreen chemistry between Billy Harvey and Leonora Moore \"is at times breathtaking\". They expanded that much of the film \"is playful (and at times hilarious),\" but that \"the beautiful photography often makes for a melancholy backdrop, as the stunning countryside constantly reminds us that these characters are strangers in a strange land, made all the more small by the ancient otherworldliness that surrounds them on all sides.\"  They summarized that the film was \"at times heavy-handed\", but that the film \"moves deftly between the realms of comedy and tragedy,\" and that the characters \"are at once likeable, and perhaps in the case of many suffering from a bit of the quarter-life crisis, even a bit familiar.\"", "Don Clinchy of the Slackerwood website wrote that the film was \"an intriguing, lyrical and visually poetic film that explores the meaning of mortality,\" calling it \"a deeply existential film with dark humor and darker implications.\"  He made special note of superb work by cinematographer Mike Sampson, and how the work \"perfectly captured\" the \"contrasts between the rural tranquility and urban activity.\"  He did have minor issues with some of the dialogue being \"slightly unnatural\" for a film with \"an otherwise authentic vibe\". He also felt that the film's romance seemed \"contrived and inconsequential\" when compared to the film's \"more substantial themes of existential angst.\"  He also found minor fault with the Nikita character agreeing so readily to take such a trip with two complete strangers, feeling that she seemed \"too sensible\", and her character  needed \"more development and backstory\" to have her actions make better sense. Other than those criticisms, he found the story \"solid and thought-provoking,\" and performances by the film's three leads to be solid. He offered that Billy Harvey's Simon was best, and that Leonora Moore did \"a great job as Nikita, a smart, savvy woman who is a sober, grounding influence on her intemperate traveling companions.\"  He offered that while first-time actor Jeff Palmiotti was occasionally \"hammy\", his performance was \"totally believable\". He concluded that the film was \"a gorgeous and captivating film, a physical and spiritual journey in an exotic land. It has much to say about life, loneliness and death, and our eternal struggles with all three.\""]}]}}
