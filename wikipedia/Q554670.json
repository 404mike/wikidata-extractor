The band peaked in popularity in 1983 with the album True, with its title track reaching No. 1 in the UK and the top five in the US.

Close friends and school mates at Dame Alice Owen's in Islington, they were joined by John Keeble on drums, Michael Ellison on bass and Tony Hadley on vocals when the school relocated to Potters Bar. They rehearsed at lunchtimes in the school's music room, playing sped-up versions of The Rolling Stones\u2019 \"Silver Train\", The Beatles \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" and The Animals \"We've Gotta Get Out of This Place.\" They also played an original Gary Kemp composition, \"I've Got Roots\", which inspired their band name, Roots. Their first gig was a fourth-form Christmas party December 1976 in the school dining room.", "The band changed their name to The Cut when Michael Ellison left, with Steve Norman filling in on bass. In 1977, another Alice Owen's pupil Richard Miller took over on bass guitar and the band changed their name to The Makers, playing power-pop compositions by Gary Kemp or Steve Norman, with titles like \"Fantasy Girl\" and \"Pin-Ups\", inspired by mid-Sixties bands like the Small Faces. They received a number of positive gig reviews from the British music press in Sounds and the New Musical Express. The band changed personnel and name once more when their manager, friend and fellow Dame Alice Owen's schoolmate Steve Dagger suggested Martin Kemp be brought in as their bass player after seeing how much attention he got from The Makers' female fans when he was their roadie. The band was now called Gentry and Martin played his first gig on 1 July 1978 at the Middlesex Polytechnic in Cockfosters.", "After a bitter court case with Chrysalis, Spandau Ballet signed to CBS Records for \u00a31.5 million in 1986 and released their fifth studio album, Through the Barricades. With producer Gary Langan, the band moved away from their pop and soul influences to create a stadium rock sound. A dispute between Our Price Records and Sony over trading arrangements resulted in the Our Price chain and its chart return shops refusing to stock any CBS singles, which affected the record sales of their first single release, \"Fight For Ourselves.\" Though it peaked at 15 in the UK, it was a Top 10 hit in Italy and the Netherlands.

Tony Hadley and Gary Kemp performed \"Through the Barricades\" for the Prince's Trust at Wembley Arena with the 'house band' of Eric Clapton, Midge Ure and Phil Collins and \"With A Little Help From My Friends\" with George Harrison and Ringo Starr.

The album and its singles were not successful in the UK and the album was not released in the United States. Nevertheless, the band continued to have success in Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, where the singles \"Raw\" and \"Be Free with Your Love\" entered the Top 40.

In 1995 Gary released his only solo album, Little Bruises.", "In the 1990s, the band split up after a disagreement about royalties. Hadley, Norman and Keeble launched an unsuccessful court case against Gary Kemp for a share of Kemp's songwriting royalties from his work with Spandau Ballet. Although they vowed to appeal the verdict, they later decided against this. The three non-Kemp members then continued to tour as a trio, but they had to sell their shares in Spandau Ballet's company to Gary Kemp to pay off legal debts.

Many musicians and groups have recalled seeing the performance and reflected on how it affected their lives. The English gothic rock band Bauhaus recalled that seeing Bowie's performance on Top of the Pops was \"a significant and profound turning point in their lives\". The band thereafter idolised Bowie and subsequently covered \"Ziggy Stardust\" in 1982. Reflecting on Bowie's impact on music in 2003, Robert Smith of the Cure said: \"He was blatantly different, and everyone of my age remembers the time he played 'Starman' on Top of the Pops.\" Bono of the Irish rock band U2 told Rolling Stone in 2010: \"The first time I saw [Bowie] was singing 'Starman' on television. It was like a creature falling from the sky. Americans put a man on the moon. We had our own British guy from space \u2013 with an Irish mother.\" English singer-songwriter Gary Numan, who saw the performance when he was 15 years old, said: \"I think it stands as one of the pivotal moments of modern music, or, if not music, certainly a pivotal moment in show business. It must have taken extraordinary courage and/or a monumental amount of self-belief. To say it stood out is an epic understatement. Even as a hardcore T. Rex fan I knew it was special.\" Ian McCulloch of the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen said in 2007: \"As soon as I heard 'Starman' and saw him on Top of the Pops, I was hooked. I seem to remember me being the first to say it, and then there was a host of other people saying how the Top of the Pops performance changed their lives.\" Elton John said: \"It was so different, it was like Wow. No one had ever seen anything like that before\"."]}, {"page": "List of guitarists", "response": ["*Gary Kemp (Spandau Ballet)"]}, {"page": "Dame Alice Owen's School", "response": ["To commemorate the school's quatercentenary in 2013, the school established a 400th Anniversary Committee chaired by the musician Gary Kemp (with Peter Martin, the chair of governors, as vice-chairman), which organised several events.
