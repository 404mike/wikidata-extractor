His defence solicitor Nigel Richardson described his client as being a well-known member of the London gay community, and remarked that \"The whole idea of something being depraved or corrupt is outdated.\" Another of the advocates for the defence, Myles Jackman, tweeted throughout the trial, using the hashtag of #obscenitytrial, and through Twitter helped to build up an online support base for Peacock. Jackman recognised it as having important implications for UK law, noting that the verdict would \"ultimately clarify the law on the representation\" of specialist sexual acts such as BDSM and urolagnia. During the trial, the defence called for expert evidence from academics studying sex and the media.", "Defense solicitor Myles Jackman  claimed that the verdict had been \"a significant victory for common sense\". He considered the trial to be the \"most significant in a decade\", believing that it \"could be the final nail in the coffin for the Obscene Publications Act in the digital age because the jury's verdict shows that normal people view consensual adult pornography as a part of everyday life and are no longer shocked, depraved or corrupted by it\". Jackman had been responsible for maintaining the Twitter account devoted to the trial, and following the verdict, a flurry of Twitter users tweeted in support of Peacock, many criticising the fact that the case ever came to court in the first place."]}, {"page": "Simon Walsh", "response": ["In August 2012, Walsh was charged with possessing five images of \"extreme pornography\", which were not found by police on his computers, but as email attachments on a Hotmail server account.

He was defended by Myles Jackman."]}, {"page": "Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014", "response": ["Upon going into force on 1 December 2014, the regulations were subject to immediate criticism, much of it arising from the debates around female ejaculation. A Vice interview with BBFC officials indicated that apparent female ejaculation was regularly cut due to restrictions on urolagnia, and the difficulty of distinguishing what could be female ejaculation from straightforward urination. A blog for the New Statesman highlighted that many of the activities were popular in the LGBT and BDSM communities or related to expressions of female sexuality. Myles Jackman, an obscenity lawyer, expressed concerns that the regulations set a dangerous precedent and described pornography as \"the canary in the coal mine\" of freedom of speech."]}, {"page": "Miles Jackman", "response": ["#REDIRECTMyles Jackman"]}, {"page": "Help talk:Citation Style 1/Archive 9", "response": [" is throwing an error on Myles Jackman for a citation of a page where the author is known only by a first name.

The provisions for the age verification of pornographic website users raised concerns about the privacy implications of collecting user data, and the possible ineffectiveness of a method focused on restricting payments to pornographic websites. Myles Jackman, ORG's legal director, highlighted the potential vulnerability of age verification systems to hacking, and suggested that it would result in more people using virtual private networks, or anonymous web browsers such as Tor. A public consultation on the BBFC's draft guidance to age verification service providers began in March 2018. The age verification provisions were due to come into effect in April 2018, were delayed until the end of 2018 and then further delayed until spring 2019. In March 2019 the BBFC published its guidance, and draft regulations \u2013 the Online Pornography (Commercial Basis) Regulations 2019 \u2013 were produced for approval by Parliament. The UK government stated in April 2019 that it planned to introduce mandatory age verification on 15 July 2019. In June 2019 the Culture Secretary, Jeremy Wright, announced that the implementation of the law had again been postponed for a period in the region of six months."]}, {"page": "Nigel Richardson", "response": ["In 2012, Richardson, together with his colleague Myles Jackman, successfully defended Simon Walsh, barrister and Greater London Assembly member who was accused of possession of extreme pornography under Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.
