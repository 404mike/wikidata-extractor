During his time there he had a loan spell at Aberdeen and then joined Preston North End.

His next penalty came in a penalty shootout against Rochdale in the Football League Trophy, which was slotted into the top corner after he was brought on as a substitute for Conor McLaughlin especially to take a penalty in the shootout. However, he missed his next penalty, again in the Football League Trophy, and again in a penalty shootout, this time against Chesterfield. He was the third Preston player to take a penalty in this shootout, and he blazed it over the bar, much to the disbelief of the fans. Preston's next penalty-taker, Paul Coutts, had his penalty saved, and then when the next penalty was scored by Chesterfield's Alexandre Mendy, Preston got knocked out of the tournament. Alexander started the next league game against Stevenage but was replaced through injury by Steven Smith after just 3 minutes, after which Alexander did not feature for the Lilywhites for a long time, and there was speculation that he had played his last game for Preston, and in his career."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|Steven Smith", "|Steven Smith"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Scottish Premier League", "response": ["| Steven Smith (Rangers)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Premier League monthly award winners", "response": ["| Steven Smith (Rangers)"]}, {"page": "Rangers F.C.
