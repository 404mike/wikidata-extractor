His debut album Step By Step sold 10,000 copies in his native UK in the late 1980s, and featured several singles, \"Head Above Water\", \"Don't Make Me Wait\", \"The Way We Touch\" and \"Be There\", which also featured James Ingram on backing vocals.\nHis second album Inside Out did not fare quite so well, with only \"I'll Be Waiting\" making any notable impact on the charts. Thus ended his recording contract with Phonogram. Picking up the pieces, in 1992 the singer embarked on a tour with Eric Clapton, before signing a US record deal with Sony Records and releasing a self-titled album in 1993.\nHis third album contained the Diane Warren compositions \"Commitment of the Heart\" (US No. 96) and \"We Don't Know How to Say Goodbye\".\nThe album proved to be his last, and aside from a guest vocal on the Preluxe track \"You're the One for Me\", Griffin has only surfaced vocally on session work for other musicians, most notably Take That (\"Never Forget\") and Kylie Minogue (\"Your Disco Needs You\").\nAs a child, Griffin provided the vocal for the Cadbury Fudge jingle, \"A finger of fudge is just enough\", written by Mike d'Abo.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals", "response": ["* \"When I Fall in Love\" \u2014 Celine Dion & Clive Griffin"]}, {"page": "Celine Dion", "response": ["The single \"When I Fall in Love\", a duet with Clive Griffin, achieved moderate success on the US and Canadian charts and was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning one.
