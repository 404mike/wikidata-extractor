DSO psc, Brig Gen The Story of the Royal Regiment of Artillery RA Institution, Woolwich 1939  The first two troops of Horse Artillery (A \u2013 later entitled \"The Chestnut Troop\" \u2013 and B) were raised in January 1793 at Goodwood, West Sussex, by the Master-General of the Ordnance,  the 3rd Duke of Richmond, to provide fire support for the cavalry. They were joined by two more troops in November 1793. Each troop had six 6-pounder guns. Another development was the formation of a headquarters staff providing a channel between the regiment and the Board of Ordnance. Captain John Macleod was the first brigade major and became the first deputy-adjutant-general in 1795. By 1806, eleven troops had been formed, with ten companies of the Royal Irish Artillery incorporated, as the Seventh Battalion, after the union with Ireland in 1801. The Royal Regiment of Artillery was not part of the British Army at this time, but part of the establishment of the Board of Ordnance, with the Master-General its commanding officer; only after the Board's abolition in 1855 did the Artillery become part of the British Army under the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces."]}, {"page": "Master Gunner, St James's Park", "response": ["|Lieutenant General Sir John Macleod GCH"]}, {"page": "Walcheren Campaign", "response": ["**Royal Artillery, commanded by Brigadier General Master Gunner, Sir John MacleodDuncan Volume I, pp. 179, 181, 219, 220\u2013222, 224\u2013226, 380, 408Duncan Volume II, pp. 154\u2013157, 187\u2013188, 195, 223\u2013224, 226, 229\u2013237, 240, 242, 451 (total of 70 x guns and 74 x mortars)"]}, {"page": "John MacLeod", "response": ["* John Macleod (Sutherland MP) (1862\u2013?), Member of Parliament for Sutherland, 1894\u20131900", "* John Macleod (British Army officer) (1752\u20131833), British general", "* John Macleod (theologian) (1872\u20131948), Scottish minister and Principal of the Free Church College", "* John Macleod (physiologist) (1876\u20131935), Scottish physician, physiologist and Nobel Laureate", "* John Macleod (songwriter), English songwriter and musician", "* John Macleod (art director), deputy design director of the New York Times"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Lieutenant-General John Macleod"]}, {"page": "Robert Gardiner (British Army officer)", "response": ["In 1816 Gardiner married Caroline Mary McLeod, eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General John Macleod and they had issue."]}, {"page": "John McLeod (British Army officer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Macleod (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Joseph Walton (British Army officer)", "response": ["He held the position of Master Gunner, St James's Park from 1783 and of Colonel of the Invalid Battalion from 1793.
