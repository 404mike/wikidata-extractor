Striker Roy Essandoh headed an injury-time winner to seal a 2\u20131 win for the Wanderers at Filbert Street. The semi-final at Villa Park saw Wycombe face Liverpool, and goals from Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler put the Premiership side up 2\u20130. A last ditch effort from club mainstay Keith Ryan gave some hope to the Wanderers, but they would exit the competition after succumbing to a 2\u20131 defeat."]}, {"page": "Steve Brown (footballer, born 1966)", "response": ["Brown retired as a player in May 2004 but was appointed as assistant to Wycombe manager John Gorman along with fellow Blues legend Keith Ryan in November 2004.

Steve Yates pulled a goal back for Tranmere after half-time, but in the 52nd minute Steven Gerrard headed-in a cross to restore Liverpool's two-goal advantage. A mistake by Robbie Fowler gifted substitute Wayne Allison the chance to score, but the striker made amends as he converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute.

Andrew Howell, Kieron St Aimie and Aaron Goode all signed one-year professional contracts after impressing in the youth team under Joe Gallen, who was later sacked, despite his under 18s winning the league. Gregory also signed more backroom staff, including Paul Hunter as the new physio, Mick Harford as assistant manager, Ed de Goey and Warren Neill as coaches and Steve Brown and Keith Ryan as youth team coaches. Creative left winger Lee Cook was sold to rivals Fulham for a deal reported as potentially worth between \u00a32.5 million and \u00a34.5 million.

After Wimbledon's relocation to Milton Keynes, manager Tony Adams offered Smith the chance to take up the role of youth team coach at Wycombe Wanderers in 2004, where he later became assistant first team coach. Following the resignation of Adams, Smith briefly filled the role of assistant manager to caretaker manager Keith Ryan in November 2004, and the club were unbeaten under their guidance. Smith reverted to his previous role of youth team coach when Wycombe appointed manager John Gorman on 30 November 2004.

After 95\u00a0years at Loakes Park, the club moved to their new ground at Adams Park. Loakes Park had become a real home, which everyone, from players to supporters, had become extremely fond of. The new ground was named after Frank Adams, a fine and truly appropriate gesture to the man who helped it become a reality. It was an essential one too as provided the financial base for the manager to build a team capable of achieving the club's dream of promotion to the Football League. Such an achievement wasn't going to be easy and Martin O'Neill started to add to the team he'd been left with. Keith Ryan was signed from Berkhamsted Town and Simon Hutchinson joined from Eastwood Town for \u00a37,000. Popular midfielder Kevin Durham left for Barnet for \u00a315,000.", "The Chairboys had reached the giddy heights of the Quarter-finals and were rewarded with a trip to Filbert Street to take on Leicester City, flying high in fourth place in the Premier League. The club had been unable to do a deal to sign Parkin permanently from Chelsea and sent out an SOS for a striker which was even advertised on teletext. Northern Irish front man Roy Essandoh answered the call and made his debut in 1\u20130 defeat at home to Port Vale. A week later 3,202 Chairboys and girls made the journey up to Leicestershire and saw Manchester United loanee George Clegg and Wanderers legend Keith Ryan lead the attack against the Foxes. After a goalless first half Paul McCarthy scored his fifth FA Cup goal, diving in to head home Steve Brown's free-kick from close range. The dream appeared to have been dashed when Muzzy Izzet finished off a fine move to equalise twenty minutes later but the underdogs brushed off that disappointment and after Robbie Savage had to be substituted through injury and Essandoh replaced Ryan they seized the initiative in the final ten minutes and looked to have a good penalty shout turned down after Stefan Oakes appeared to handle in the area. Lawrie Sanchez was incensed and walked out of his technical area and down the touchline to remonstrate with the linesman. As the game went into injury-time Bulman swung in a cross to far post where Bates headed the ball back for Essandoh to leap like the proverbial salmon and head powerfully past Royce into the top corner. It was a sensational moment and although referee Steve Bennett played the role of spoilsport by showing Steve Brown a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration, there was little time for Leicester to come back and he blew the final whistle to confirm one of the biggest shocks in the competition's history. It sparked wild scenes of elation and disbelief as Wycombe Wanderers, a Football League club for less than eight years, were through to the semi-finals of the FA Cup.", "The epic journey took the Blues to Villa Park to face the mighty Liverpool. 19,403 supporters travelled to Birmingham for one of the proudest moments in the club's history. It was a day to be cherished, with both tears of joy and sadness shed. A determined and well organised defence stood up to an International renowned attack boasting the likes of Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler, Nick Barmby, Gary McAllister, Steven Gerrard and Emile Heskey. They were just 12 minutes left when Gerrard's cross was headed home by Heskey. Four minutes later a Robbie Fowler free-kick made it two and the Reds looked home and dry. However, with just three minutes left Keith Ryan chipped the ball over Sander Westerveld and into the net to make it 2\u20131. The Cup run had seen the team's league form falter and were left precariously close to a relegation battle with a back log of fixtures. An Easter Monday fixture at Bristol City was crucial and Wycombe came from a goal down to win 2\u20131 thanks to a last minute winner from Guy Whittingham.
