Originally starting his production career in the UK hardcore scene, he moved into jungle. He was signed to drum and bass/jungle record label Botchit and Scarper. Wanting to avoid the increasing politics within the scene, he began to produce experimental drum and bass, culminating in the album, The Self Evident Truth of an Intuitive Mind. Following from this, came the next album Waveform. Less accessible, it carried his experimental tracks further into the left field.Partnering with Shy FX, he released the album Long Time Dead, which featured vocals and electric violin by Ysanne Spevack and also started a record label named Digital Soundboy.T Power was half of the band Chocolate Weasel, with Chris Stevens. They released a single \"Music for Body Lockers\", and then a funk and hip-hop album called Spaghettification in 1998.In 2004, in collaboration with fellow producer Andre Williams, Royal issued a couple of singles billed as 'Ebony Dubsters'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shy FX", "response": ["Throughout his career, he has collaborated with T Power, both as Ebony Dubsters and Shy FX and T Power; their 2001 breakthrough track \"Shake Ur Body\" with vocalist Di (real name Dianne Joseph) was a number 7 hit in the UK Singles Chart.

Several EPs and single releases followed; by 2005, Shy FX had made the decision to consolidate his releases onto his own label and founded Digital Soundboy Recordings. In collaboration with T Power, they subsequently released the album Diary of a Digital Sound Boy on 17 October 2005, featuring the songs \"Feelings\", \"On The Run\" and \"Plastic Soul\". Shy FX and T Power also released \"Don't Wanna Know\" featuring Di and MC Skibadee.

The label subsequently grew its genre coverage to the point where its discography includes electro, drum and bass, jungle, dubstep, house and UK funky releases from dozens of artists.
