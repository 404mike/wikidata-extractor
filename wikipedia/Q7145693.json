The 12 books in the Jinny series were published between 1976 and 1988 by Armada.  They are currently in reprint by Catnip Publishers. Two more of her novels, Dream of Fair Horses (1975) and The Horse from Black Loch (1963) have been republished by Jane Badger Books. She has also written under the pseudonym Jane Eliot.The Jinny series books often contain this brief biographical information:\n\n\"Patricia Leitch started riding when a friend persuaded her to go on a pony trekking holiday - and by the following summer she had her own Highland pony, Kirsty.  She wrote her first book shortly after this and writing is now her full-time occupation, but she has also done all sorts of different jobs, including being a riding-school instructor, groom, teacher and librarian.  She lives in Renfrewshire, Scotland, with a bearded collie called Meg.\"\nPatricia Leitch was a vegan.  Animal welfare and vegetarianism are strong themes in her books.  Celtic, Arabic and Buddhist mythology and philosophy are also frequently referred to.\nThe Jinny series marks a significant departure from the traditional 'tweedy' horse and pony stories aimed at middle-class children.  Jinny is a scruffy, willful, tom-boyish girl who doesn't have any social or romantic aspirations. Serious social justice issues are raised throughout the series, forcing Jinny to confront her own prejudices and character faults.\nUnderlying the series is a sense of predestination deriving from Celtic mythology.  Jinny is portrayed as a gifted or chosen child with special and dangerous tasks to perform, guided by mysterious and sometimes frightening characters such as the Red Horse (agent of the Celtic Horse Goddess Epona) and the Walker.  In this way it resembles the Dark Is Rising sequence by Susan Cooper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jane Elliott (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Patricia Leitch (1933\u20132015), British children's author who also used the pseudonym Jane Eliot "]}, {"page": "Pony book", "response": ["* Patricia Leitch"]}, {"page": "1933 in Scotland", "response": ["* 13 July \u2013 Patricia Leitch writer, best known for children's books (died 2015)"]}]}}
