Jessop had to jump out of her lifeboat, resulting in a traumatic head injury which she survived. In her memoirs, she described the scene she witnessed as Britannic went under: \"The white pride of the ocean's medical world ... dipped her head a little, then a little lower and still lower. All the deck machinery fell into the sea like a child's toys. Then she took a fearful plunge, her stern rearing hundreds of feet into the air until with a final roar, she disappeared into the depths.\" Arthur John Priest and Archie Jewell, two other survivors of the Titanic, were also onboard and both survived."]}, {"page": "Frederick Fleet", "response": ["Fleet boarded the Titanic in Southampton on 10 April 1912. The ship made two stops, first in Cherbourg, France, and then in Queenstown, Ireland. The lookouts, six in total, made two-hour shifts due to extreme cold in the crow's nest. The trip was uneventful until the night of 14 April 1912. At 22:00 (10\u00a0p.m.) that night, Fleet and his fellow lookout Reginald Lee replaced George Symons and Archie Jewell at the nest. They were passed the order given earlier by second officer Charles Lightoller to watch out for small ice. The night was calm and moonless, which made it difficult to spot the icebergs due to the lack of waves breaking against the base of the iceberg and reflection. Despite Fleet and his fellow lookouts having repeatedly requested to be provided with binoculars,historicsouthampton.wordpress.com/encyclopedia-titanica.org they were not available for the lookouts. This is sometimes attributed to the last-minute change in the hierarchy of the ship when officer David Blair was removed from the maiden voyage crew (due to the knock-on effect of Henry Tingle Wilde being appointed chief officer) without mentioning where the binoculars had been located. It has been also mentioned that Blair accidentally took the keys of the cabinet containing the binoculars with him. Despite both inquiries into the disaster, nothing clarified why the lookouts were not provided with binoculars, although there are many possible explanations such as one that the White Star Line steamers' lookouts did not particularly use them. Some experts have said that even using binoculars, neither Fleet nor Lee could have spotted the iceberg any sooner given the conditions of the night.10 causes of the Titanic tragedy, NBC news."]}, {"page": "Reginald Lee", "response": ["He joined the Titanics crew on 6 April 1912, having been transferred from its sister ship, RMS Olympic. On 14 April at 10 p.m., Lee joined lookout Frederick Fleet in the crow's nest replacing Archie Jewell and George Symons.

On the night of 14 April 1912, Symons and Jewell were replaced by their colleagues Reginald Lee and Frederick Fleet and off-duty when the iceberg struck the ship. Shortly afterwards, he was ordered to go up to boat deck and help with the task of loading the lifeboats. At around 1:00am, First Officer William McMaster Murdoch began to load Boat #1. Despite the orders of loading the boats with women and children first, Murdoch put Symons in charge of the lifeboat and loaded it with five stokers, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, her secretary and three other First-class passengers. The boat finally rowed away from the Titanic at 1:05am. It was picked by the RMS Carpathia hours later."]}, {"page": "Arthur John Priest", "response": ["Priest worked as a stoker, in the bowels of steam-powered ships. He was considered a part of the black gang, in a group of 27 men, which consisted of six firemen, two trimmers, and the firemen's steward colloquially known as a 'peggy' whose task was to bring food and refreshments to the group. The work was intense and often done while stripped to the waist due to the sustained and intense heat of the furnaces. While working as a stoker, Priest survived five ship sinkings and one collision. The ships he voyaged on included HMHS Asturias (1907), RMS Olympic (1911), RMS Titanic (1912), RMS Alcantara 1916, HMHS Britannic (1916) and SS Donegal (1917). Accidents and sinkings at this time were relatively common. Two other survivors of the Titanic, Archie Jewell and Violet Jessop, would later also survive the sinking of the Britannic with Priest. In 1917 Priest was awarded the Mercantile Marine Ribbon for his service in the war."]}, {"page": "Archibald Jewell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archie Jewell"]}]}}
