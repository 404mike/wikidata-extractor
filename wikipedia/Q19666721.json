The vessel was commissioned into the RCN on 13\u00a0August 1915. Stadacona was then sent to the Canadian Vickers shipyard in Montreal, Quebec to fit out. The vessel was given one  gun forward and a 12-pounder gun was added aft later in the war. The vessel then sailed to Sydney, Nova Scotia to begin her career as a patrol vessel in September. In 1916 Stadacona was among the vessels assigned to patrol the Cabot Strait. The vessel became flagship of the Canada's East Coast fleet based at Halifax under Vice Admiral Sir Charles Coke on 30\u00a0April 1916. Stadacona remained flagship of the fleet after Walter Hose took over command from Sir Charles Coke on 14\u00a0August. In August\u00a01918 the German U-boat  captured the fishing trawler Triumph off the East Coast of Canada. Using the trawler to get close to the Atlantic fishing fleets, the Germans sank several Canadian and American fishing trawlers. Stadacona was among the vessels dispatched to deal with the submarine. However, the Germans scuttled Triumph once the fishing trawler ran out of fuel."]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland", "response": ["*Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Coke (1911-1915)"]}, {"page": "Charles Henry Coke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Coke"]}, {"page": "Coke, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Coke"]}]}}
