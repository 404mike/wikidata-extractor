From 22 to 29 October 1923, Hitler and his associates planned to use Munich as a base for a march against Germany's Weimar Republic government. But circumstances differed from those in Italy. Hitler came to the realisation that Kahr sought to control him and was not ready to act against the government in Berlin. Hitler wanted to seize a critical moment for successful popular agitation and support. He decided to take matters into his own hands. Hitler, along with a large detachment of SA, marched on the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller, where Kahr was making a speech in front of 3,000 people.Piers Brendon, The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s, p. 36 ", "Hitler, accompanied by Hess, Lenk, and Graf, ordered the triumvirate of Kahr, Seisser and Lossow into an adjoining room at gunpoint and demanded they support the putschPiers Brendon, The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s, pp. 36\u201337  and accept the government positions he assigned them.

Hitler and Hess were both sentenced to five years in  ('fortress confinement') for treason. Festungshaft was the mildest of the three types of jail sentence available in German law at the time; it excluded forced labour, provided reasonably comfortable cells, and allowed the prisoner to receive visitors almost daily for many hours. This was the customary sentence for those whom the judge believed to have had honourable but misguided motives, and it did not carry the stigma of a sentence of Gef\u00e4ngnis (common prison) or Zuchthaus (disciplinary prison).
