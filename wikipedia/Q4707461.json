In 1967, an MCC U-25 side played a Pakistan North Zone team, a match which is notable for Mike Brearley's highest first class score. The visitors' captain made 312 not out in a day as MCC piled up 514 for four against opposition including the later Test captain Intikhab Alam, declared, then won by an innings and 139 runs on the third day. He shared double century stands with Alan Knott and Alan Ormrod (records for the first and fifth wickets at the ground), and his innings remains the highest on the ground, despite Zakir Butt's 290 for Pakistan Railways six years later. Brearley was dropped several times after reaching his double-century and there appears to have been some suggestion that at some stage the scorers may have got Brearley and his batting partner Ormrod mixed up."]}, {"page": "Ivan Johnson", "response": ["In 1973, Johnson played for Worcestershire against the touring New Zealand team at Worcester. He scored 36 not out to help Worcestershire avoid a follow-on. New Zealand made a large first innings total, with the opener, Glenn Turner, scoring 143. When not touring with New Zealand, Turner was one of Worcestershire's international players. Early in Turner's innings, Johnson bowled and Alan Ormrod unusually, dropped at slip.

The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to play. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset and chose to bat, opening the batting himself alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's Vanburn Holder bowled the first over, which consisted of seven deliveries as it included a no-ball, to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots. The Somerset captain declared the innings closed at the end of the over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no-ball, and Worcestershire only needed two runs to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod opened Worcestershire's batting. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored a single from the fourth delivery which gave Worcestershire the victory.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" | Alan Ormrod"]}, {"page": "Marylebone Cricket Club Under-25 cricket team in Pakistan in 1966\u201367", "response": ["* Alan Ormrod (24)"]}]}}
