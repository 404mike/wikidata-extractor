Born in Basildon, he was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. During his career in First Class and List A cricket he played for Essex and Suffolk.\nAfter a debut performance in the Sri Lanka A tour in July 1999, he waited a year before another first-class appearance, waiting until the 2000 County Championship before a debut against Worcestershire in which he was caught-and-bowled off the bowling of Vikram Solanki, and took five wickets in total with his bowling.\nFor the second half of the 2004 season until the end of the 2006 season McGarry played for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship. Due to a run of injuries in the Essex squad, he was re-signed for the 2007 season, but having played just a handful of games, suffered a broken hand, and was again released at the end of the season. He, once again, played for Suffolk during the 2008 season.\nIn 2017 he was appointed head coach of Old Southendian & Southchurch Cricket Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford", "response": ["* Andrew McGarry, former Essex cricketer"]}, {"page": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["After rain, play began at 3pm at Bury St Edmunds with Glamorgan batting first.
