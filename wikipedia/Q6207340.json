He was later loaned to East Fife, and played for them in the 1927 Scottish Cup Final against Celtic.Gilfillan moved to play in England with Portsmouth of the Football League in December 1928. He was to go on to make 359 senior appearances with the south coast club, including playing for them in the FA Cup Finals of 1929 and 1934. In his nine seasons with the club he kept 107 clean sheets in 330 League matches.In April 2009, he was included in a Times list of the Top 50 Portsmouth players of all time, and was described as being \"one of the finest keepers in the club\u2019s history with excellent positioning and agility the key to his success.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Mills (footballer)", "response": ["Mills was born in Portsmouth, the grandson of Portsmouth's 1934 FA Cup goalkeeper, Jock Gilfillan.

Swift, the youngest and most inexperienced of the team, was nervous. As the playing surface was wet, he was unsure whether or not to wear gloves. Seeing Portsmouth goalkeeper Jock Gilfillan take to the field without gloves, he decided to follow suit. Portsmouth took the lead in the first half through a Septimus Rutherford shot. At half time Swift slumped in the dressing room, blaming himself and his decision not to wear gloves for the goal. Forward Fred Tilson attempted to improve Swift's spirits by telling him not to worry as he would \"plonk two in next half\".James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p. 117. Tilson duly scored two second half goals, the second with less than five minutes remaining. A tense finish followed, in which a photographer behind Swift's goal gave regular updates of the time remaining. At the final whistle, Swift was so overcome with emotion that he fainted. He recovered in time to receive his winners' medal from George V, who sent a telegram enquiring about his condition on the following Monday."]}, {"page": "1934 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The Manchester City team contained eight players who had started the 1933 final.Creighton, Manchester City: Moments to Remember, p. 40.

The 1934 final was played in wet conditions. On 26 minutes, Jack Weddle aimed a pass over the head of Cowan to Septimus Rutherford. The winger's shot was touched by Swift, but not strongly enough to prevent a goal for Portsmouth. The goalkeeper recounted his disappointment at conceding in his 1949 autobiography: \"Rutherford, the Pompey outside-right, came coasting in and fired a ball across the goal to my right hand. I dived and the ball slithered through into the net off my fingers. I was desolate, and as I picked the ball out of the net, thought \"Just another Wembley goalkeeper.\"\"Swift, Football From The Goalmouth, pp. 38\u20139.

He made his debut at the end of the 1922\u201323 Football League season, and took over as Portsmouth's first-choice goalkeeper in October 1925, by which time the club was playing in the Second Division. They gained promotion to the First Division in 1926\u201327, and McPhail played regularly, keeping seven consecutive clean sheets in the second half of the 1927\u201328 season to help avoid relegation. He retained his place, despite conceding ten goals against Leicester City in what remains, , Portsmouth's record league defeat, until breaking his wrist in October 1928. Although he remained with the club for another two-and-a-half years, he was unable to dislodge Jock Gilfillan from the starting eleven. Ahead of the 1930\u201331 season, the Daily Mirror wrote that \"Gilfillan's goalkeeping was so satisfactory last season that he was never disturbed from his position and was the only ever-present on the club's books.
