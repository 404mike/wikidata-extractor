He made his professional footballing debut while on loan at League Two side Northampton Town during the 2009\u201310 season. Steele made his Middlesbrough debut in the 2010\u201311 season, and eventually became their first-choice goalkeeper within their Championship campaign, after being relegated from the top flight the season before last. Steele represented England at all youth levels; his positive performances led him to being called up to the Great Britain Olympic team for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games held in London, making a singular appearance against Brazil at the Riverside Stadium. Steele maintained his role at Middlesbrough for three seasons, though the arrivals of Dimitrios Konstantopoulos and Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00edas in the 2013\u201314 season saw Steele's position at the club become threatened; he left at the end of that season.In the 2014\u201315 season, Steele joined fellow Championship club Blackburn Rovers on loan. He then signed for them on a permanent basis at the beginning of the 2015 winter transfer window. He quickly established himself as their first-choice goalkeeper though in the 2016\u201317 season, Blackburn were relegated to League One, which culminated in Steele's departure to Sunderland, who were newly relegated to the Championship for the 2017\u201318 league campaign. Steele's tenure at Sunderland was a sour note: he lost his intended role of first-choice goalkeeper to Robbin Ruiter and then Lee Camp and the club were relegated to League One at the end of the season, which meant that both Sunderland and Steele (as a player) had suffered two consecutive relegations. The events of the season led to a Netflix documentary entitled Sunderland 'Til I Die being produced, which was released in December 2018.He left Sunderland after one season, joining Brighton & Hove Albion of the Premier League serving as back-up, where he eventually made his Premier League debut in November 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["|2013|| Jason Steele"]}, {"page": "Newton Aycliffe", "response": ["* Jason Steele, goalkeeper for Brighton & Hove Albion and formerly Middlesbrough F.C "]}, {"page": "Shay Given", "response": ["Given joined Middlesbrough on a one-month loan deal on 28 November 2013 as cover for the injured Jason Steele.

On 15 November 2014, Robinson announced his intentions of leaving the club in the January transfer window. He said that, \"I'm pretty much surplus to requirements at Blackburn. I'm not even on the bench. I'm training hard at the moment though. My contract is up at the end of the season so I'm not sure if that's got anything to do with it. I want to keep playing and, I believe, I've got another two or three years left in me.\" At the end of the season, it was announced that he would be released at the end of his contract."]}, {"page": "Dimitrios Konstantopoulos", "response": ["On 16 August 2013, Konstantopoulos signed a short-term deal with Middlesbrough until January 2014, which was later extended to the end of the season.

He then made his full league debut against Ipswich Town on 8 March 2014 in a 2\u20130 victory. After Given returned to Aston Villa, Aitor Karanka opted to use Konstantopoulos as his number one goalkeeper, ahead of Steele and Tomas Mejias, and Middlesbrough opened contract talks with Konstantopoulos in April 2014. On 1 May 2014, Konstantopoulos signed a new one-year contract with Middlesbrough after making 13 appearances."]}, {"page": "Danny Coyne", "response": ["The 2009\u201310 season started well for the shot stopper; he was the only keeper in the Championship to keep clean sheets in the first four games of the season. For a short period Coyne was dropped as first choice keeper after a 5\u20130 thrashing against West Bromwich Albion, only to return after a subsequent poor performance by Middlesbrough first choice keeper Brad Jones. Coyne has mostly been Middlesbrough's second choice keeper, first behind Jones, then when he departed Jason Steele became first Gordon Strachan's first choice goalkeeper, then his successor Tony Mowbray's number one. Even when Steele was out injured Mowbray had brought in Paul Smith and then Carl Ikeme on loan from Nottingham Forest and Wolves respectively.
