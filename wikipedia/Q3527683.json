In a book first published in 1982, the cricket writer and Somerset historian David Foot wrote: \"Harold Gimblett is the greatest batsman Somerset has ever produced.\"Gimblett scored at a fast rate throughout his career, and hit 265 sixes \u2013 \"surely a record for a regular opening batsman\", wrote Eric Hill, his postwar opening partner and thereafter a long-time journalist watcher of Somerset. He appeared, however, in only three Tests, none of them against Australia, and he left first-class cricket abruptly, suffering from mental health problems that would remain with him to the end of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1952 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Fred Trueman, Harold Gimblett, Tom Graveney, David Sheppard, Stuart Surridge"]}, {"page": "Frome", "response": ["Frome Cricket Club plays cricket at the Agricultural Showgrounds on the Bath side of town.

Wisden said of Trueman in its dedication that he \"is 5 ft 10\u00bd in. and weighs 13st 9lbs\" and \"gives promise of becoming a second Harold Larwood\". Having mentioned his problem with \"stitch\", Wisden remarked that \"it is doubtful whether Trueman has reached the stage of physical development to bowl the long spells which may be necessary against Test batsmen of the highest class\". While Yorkshire thought Trueman would need two more seasons \"before he can do everything asked\", England certainly possess \"the best fast bowling prospect in years\" and Wisden followed this comment with a direct comparison of Trueman's attributes with those of Larwood."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Harold Gimblett"]}, {"page": "Marcus Trescothick", "response": ["The book has been widely commended for its honesty, with Trescothick's difficulties drawing comparison with Harold Gimblett's similar mental health problems.

Trescothick finished his first season without the captaincy since retiring from England duty with a season average of over 53 and also became the Somerset cricketer with the highest number of first class catches in the history of the club. He extended his contract with Somerset for the 2017 season during which he broke the record previously belonging to Harold Gimblett for most first class centuries for Somerset and signed another 12 month extension with Somerset in August 2017, to the end of the 2018 season, his 26th season with Somerset.

Among the amateurs, the west Somerset farmer Jack White, who succeeded Daniell as captain in 1927, played for England as a left-arm orthodox spinning all-rounder and also captained the Test side in Australia in 1928\u201329. The briefest Test match career of them all was \"enjoyed\" by another amateur, Jack MacBryan, whose only game for England was the rain-ruined match against the South Africans in 1924, in which he neither batted nor bowled.

The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries, and were keen to see Hamence do the same. The rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone, only to see him stumped for 99, his highest score for the season.

Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team.

Playing mostly as the opening partner to the ebullient Harold Gimblett, Angell was a restrained, neat batsman and made 933 runs in his first full season, though his average was only 20 and he passed 50 only three times. There was a very similar record in 1951, with 975 runs, again at an average of 20. In 1952, Angell made his highest score of 90 in the match against Derbyshire at Derby.

Forced to follow on after being bowled out for 51 in 23 overs, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets. Johnston ended with 1/28 as the home team capitulated for 124 and lost by an innings. The victory over Kent was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England. Johnston was rested as Australia completed another innings victory. He returned for the match against Somerset, which resulted in a third consecutive innings win. After Australia had declared at 5/560, Johnston took the opening wicket of Harold Gimblett before returning to take the last two scalps of the first innings from consecutive balls, bowling his finger spin. He ended with 3/34 as Somerset fell for 115 and were forced to follow on. Johnston bowled the second over of the second innings. As Johnston had taken wickets with his last two balls in the first innings, his first delivery was the hat-trick ball. Gimblett negotiated the first ball safely, before being trapped lbw for a duck on the next. Johnston had thus taken three wickets in four balls. He bowled unchanged throughout the innings to end with 5/34 from 17.4 overs as Somerset were bowled out for 71.
