The wig sometimes appeared in the credits, with variations on \"Mr Wise appears by kind permission of Rentawig\". Eric never seemed to tire of offering his partner some \"Tea, Ern?\". This was a pun on \"tea urn\", a vessel for serving hot drinks used in workplaces. If anyone fluffed their line, Eric would usually say, \"That's easy for you to say!\"  or \"You can say that again\". When Ernie disagreed with him, Eric would say, \"Just watch it, that's all!\"; often said by Eric when grabbing Ernie by the lapels. If someone said a line whilst he was looking at somebody else, Eric would say, \"You said that without moving your lips\"; as if the non-speaker were a ventriloquist throwing his or her voice. Another ventriloquial allusion (probably quoting Arthur Worsley) was made when Eric said, should his intended listener be looking away, \"Look at me when I'm talking to you!\"."]}, {"page": "Worsley (surname)", "response": ["* Arthur Worsley (1920\u20132001), English ventriloquist"]}, {"page": "List of people from Oldham", "response": ["* Arthur Worsley (1920\u20132001) \u2013 Failsworth-born ventriloquist; appeared regularly on British television from the 1950s to the 1970s"]}, {"page": "Nat Jackley", "response": ["* This'll Make You Laugh (1956), revue with Tessie O'Shea, Sabrina and Arthur Worsley", "* Off The Record (1950), revue at the Victoria Palace Theatre, London with Eddie Calvert and Arthur Worsley"]}, {"page": "Carleton Crematorium and Cemetery", "response": ["* Arthur Worsley, ventriloquist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2001", "response": ["*Arthur Worsley, 80, British ventriloquist."]}]}}
