He arrived in the region to become an apprentice with the North Staffordshire Railway Company and, wishing to continue playing the game that he had enjoyed whilst at school, established the first formal association football club in the region. The club's first documented match was in October 1868, against a scratch team brought together for the occasion by E.W May. Harry Almond captained the Stoke Ramblers team and also scored the club's first goal. The club's first recorded away match was at Congleton, a rugby club that were convinced to play a one-off fixture under association rules, in December 1868. From the 1860s, the club played at the Victoria Cricket Club ground; however they switched to a nearby ground at Sweetings Field in 1875 to cope with rising attendances."]}, {"page": "Henry John Almond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Almond"]}, {"page": "1883\u201384 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["The club contends that it was formed in 1863 as Stoke Ramblers F.C. when Railway students from the Charterhouse School in Surrey moved to Stoke-upon-Trent to work as apprentices for the North Staffordshire Railway Works. Amongst them was Henry Almond who was a keen sportsman and it is believed that he introduced football to the local workers although there is no record that matches took place. However, in 1868 it was reported in The Field newspaper that Stoke Ramblers had been formed with Almond as its captain and the club was to play under association football rules. It remains unclear as to whether Stoke played any matches from 1863 to 1868.", "Stoke's first recorded match was a fifteen-a-side game against E.W May's XV on 17 October 1868. Both sides were made up of local railway employees with Stoke Ramblers being captained by Henry Almond who played a major role in creating the club. The match finished 1\u20131 with both goals being scored by Almond and May. Stoke's second match was a goalless draw with D. Gordon's XI and then another draw followed against Congleton. Stoke recorded their first victory against Newcastle under-Lyme by the score of 2\u20130. The local papers stated that the matches were attended by a 'fashionable assembling of spectators'. Their final match of the first season saw them play Leek under Rugby football rules with Stoke winning by a goal and one try to Leek's two tries."]}, {"page": "Almond (surname)", "response": ["*Henry Almond (1850\u20131910), English football forward"]}]}}
