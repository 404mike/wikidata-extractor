The granting of authority to a super-parliament composed of many competing interests was seen by opponents as a compromise to the powers of the local parliaments. Leading colonial supporters of imperial federation, such as Australian prime minister Alfred Deakin, however saw the movement as a way to increase the influence of the dominions over imperial defence and foreign policy. The colonial branches of the Imperial Federation League in fact outlived the demise of the home branch in London, which collapsed in 1896 when it failed to resolve internal disputes over imperial trade policy."]}, {"page": "Jebb", "response": ["*Richard Jebb (journalist) (1874\u20131953), English journalist and author", "*Sir Richard Jebb, 1st Baronet (1729\u20131787), English physician", "*Richard Jebb (barrister) (1766\u20131834), Irish judge"]}, {"page": "Fabian Ware", "response": ["When the editor-in-chief of The Morning Post, James Nicol Dunn, resigned during the Russo\u2013Japanese War, Ware had written to Oliver Borthwick and asked whether he could work on the paper's staff. Several years later, in April 1905, Lord Glenesk offered the editorship of The Morning Post to Ware, in part through Milner's influence. Ware accepted, and moved back to England, taking the position in March. Historian A. J. A. Morris writes that Glenesk intended for Ware to \"be the much needed new broom\" for the paper. When Ware became editor, The Morning Post had no offices. Its staff worked instead in temporary wooden sheds. He began expanding the paper by hiring Richard Jebb as a contributor, who in turn hired many other correspondents. The two began to focus the paper on the British Dominions, a move they presented as a means to increase the paper's circulation; though it allowed for new sources of advertising, the move did not lead to higher circulation. Ware aimed to make the paper \"the authority on all colonial questions,\" and supported social and tariff reform. He invited radicals such as William Beveridge and R. H. Tawney to contribute to the paper. Shortly after beginning work, Ware came into conflict with Glenesk, who thought he should not promote tariff reform, and wrote asking Lord Glenesk's daughter, Lady Bathurst, to intervene and threatening to resign. As a result of his initiatives, Ware was disliked by some members of the paper's staff, particularly Spenser Wilkinson, the paper's leader writer, and E. E. Peacock, the paper's manager. Ware also supported Richard Jebb's campaign against respected conservative Robert Cecil for the Marylebone East Parliament seatwhich cost the paper readership."]}, {"page": "List of Old Marlburians", "response": ["* Richard Jebb, journalist"]}, {"page": "Richard Jebb", "response": ["Richard Jebb may refer to:", "*Richard Jebb (journalist) (1874\u20131953), English journalist and author", "*Sir Richard Jebb, 1st Baronet (1729\u20131787), English physician", "*Richard Jebb (barrister) (1766\u20131834), Irish judge"]}, {"page": "Louisa Wilkins", "response": ["Arthur Trevor Jebb.
