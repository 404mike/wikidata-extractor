Bouhanni started his sprint behind his leadout man, and as he began to accelerate up to speed, he veered to his left to try and get onto the wheel of eventual winner Elia Viviani. In doing so, Bouhanni pinned Jake Stewart against the barriers. Though Stewart was able to stay upright and avoid causing a crash, the contact from Bouhanni sapped his momentum and he ended up finishing 29th. After the race, Stewart and other fellow sprinters took to social media to criticise Bouhanni and call for his suspension, drawing similarities between Bouhanni's actions and those of Dylan Groenewegen at the 2020 Tour de Pologne, which caused Fabio Jakobsen to crash and sustain heavy injuries. On 12 May 2021, for his 'dangerous conduct,' the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) handed Bouhanni a retroactive two-month suspension, expiring on 7 June 2021."]}, {"page": "Trofeo Banca Popolare di Vicenza", "response": ["| Jake Stewart"]}, {"page": "Eschborn\u2013Frankfurt Under\u201323", "response": ["| 2019 ||  Frederik Rodenberg ||  Kaden Groves ||  Jake Stewart"]}, {"page": "2017 UEC European Track Championships (under-23 & junior)", "response": ["|Rhys BrittonJoe NallyJake StewartFred Wright || 4:08.652", "|Rhys BrittonJake Stewart || 26 pts"]}, {"page": "Joe Holt", "response": ["::2nd 15px Madison (with Jake Stewart)"]}, {"page": "Rhys Britton", "response": [": 1st 20px Madison (with Jake Stewart), National Junior Track Championships", "::3rd 15px Madison (with Jake Stewart)"]}, {"page": "Fred Wright (cyclist)", "response": [": 3rd 15px Madison (with Jake Stewart), National Track Championships"]}, {"page": "British National Points Championships", "response": ["| 2016 || Matthew Walls || Jake Stewart || Rhys Britton", "| 2015 || Jake Stewart ||Rhys Britton || Joe Nally"]}, {"page": "British National Scratch Championships", "response": ["| 2017 || Tom Pidcock || Jake Stewart || Ethan Vernon", "| 2015 || Rhys Britton || Fred Wright || Jake Stewart"]}, {"page": "British National Individual Pursuit Championships", "response": ["| 2015 || Rhys Britton || Fred Wright || Jake Stewart"]}, {"page": "British National Individual Time Trial Championships", "response": ["| 2016 || Rhys Britton || Jake Stewart || Hamish Turnbull", "| 2015 || Hamish Turnbull || Rhys Britton || Jake Stewart"]}, {"page": "2020 Groupama\u2013FDJ season", "response": ["|Jake Stewart || neo-pro ()"]}]}}
