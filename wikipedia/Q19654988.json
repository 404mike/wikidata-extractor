On 6 February, Ryan made his debut for Arsenal covering for suspended Bernd Leno in a 1\u20130 away loss at Aston Villa. It was more than two months until Ryan's next appearance with Leno being dropped to the bench. Ryan was beaten when Gabriel conceded a penalty with Josh Maja converting from the spot in an eventual 1\u20131 home draw against a struggling Fulham on 18 April. Ryan ironically played a role in Arsenal's equaliser after going up for a corner.

The form of top goalscorer Freddie Ladapo was the shining light in a disappointing first half of the season, with a stand-out low point of a 5\u20131 defeat away to Luton Town. The turn of the new year saw Argyle pick up form, winning 6 of their first 9 games of 2019, and losing just 2 of the first 12, culminating in a 5\u20131 win over Rochdale on 23 February. This run coincided with the return of Kyle Letheren in between the sticks in place of Matt Macey. An injury to Letheren and a stop\u2013start March followed with Argyle winning late on against Shrewsbury Town at home, before giving away a 2\u20131 and then a 2\u20130 lead to Bristol Rovers and then Blackpool in the dying minutes to draw both matches. What was seemingly 6 points dropped to 2 proved costly as Argyle's league form dipped, losing every single game in April, and following a 5\u20131 defeat to Accrington Stanley which left the club in the EFL League One relegation zone with just one match of the season left to play, Derek Adams and his assistant Paul Wotton were relieved of their duties. Kevin Nancekivell took over as caretaker manager for the final game of the season, and despite winning 3\u20132 against Scunthorpe United, results elsewhere at games involving Southend United and AFC Wimbledon saw Argyle relegated to the EFL League Two."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| Matt Macey"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|Matt Macey"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["*  \u2013 Former youth team Goalkeeper Matt Macey joined Arsenal.
