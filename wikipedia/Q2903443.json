He made his debut in a 1\u20130 win over Chelsea on 25 December 1954, and by the end of the 1954-55 he was Arsenal's first choice right-Winger, taking Arthur Milton's place. He became a near ever-present for Arsenal for the next four seasons (aside from 1957-58, where he was out injured for a third of the season), helping Arsenal to third place in 1958-59, their highest league position in six years.\nClapton was also called up for England, playing a solitary international match against Wales on 26 November 1958 at Villa Park, which finished 2-2. Arsenal played a friendly match later that day against Juventus at Highbury, and Clapton played in that match as well, alongside teammate Jack Kelsey, who earlier in the day had been in goal for Wales.\nAfter Arsenal signed Jackie Henderson and Alan Skirton, Clapton had to be content with sharing the right wing position in 1959-60 and 1960-61. Arsenal then signed Johnny MacLeod in the summer of 1961, and Clapton lost his place in the side altogether (only playing five matches in 1961-62) and was sold to Luton Town in September 1962. In all he played 225 matches for Arsenal, scoring 27 goals.\nClapton's spell at Luton was uneventful; he later moved to Australia to play for Sydney side Corinthians. He returned to England in 1970 and later ran a pub in Hackney. His younger brother Denis was also a footballer, but never achieved the same success, making only five league appearances for Arsenal and Northampton Town. He died aged 51, in 1986.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Skirton", "response": ["He finally made his debut for Arsenal against Burnley on 20 August 1960. He played sixteen games that season, sharing the right wing position with Danny Clapton. He supplanted Clapton altogether the following season, and scored nineteen goals in 40 matches, making him the club's top scorer for that season."]}, {"page": "Arthur Milton", "response": ["After making only twelve League appearances, Milton was called up for England, and won his first and only cap, in a 2\u20132 draw against Austria on 28 November 1951.

He spent the next two seasons playing for Arsenal Reserves, making just 2 appearances in the English League. On both occasions, during the 1960\u201361 season, he deputised for the injured Danny Clapton. He made his senior debut for Arsenal on New Year's Eve 1960 in a 5\u20133 away win against Nottingham Forest and then played again in a home game against Blackpool."]}, {"page": "Arsenal F.C.
