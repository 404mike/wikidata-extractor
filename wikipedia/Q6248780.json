Most of his paintings were of the West Penwith peninsula and Tresco in the Isles of Scilly.\nDuring the 1970s John Miller emerged as a cultural figurehead within Cornwall. He became well known as a painter of popular, Monet-like Cornish scenes (many of which were cheaply reproduced as prints for the tourist trade), as an art teacher, a television personality, a patron of local charities and an active supporter of the Church of England. He was also responsible for some high-profile architectural projects including a reordering of the interior of Newlyn Art Gallery.\nAt an advanced stage in his career John Miller\u2019s artistic style underwent a radical change and by the mid-1990s his work (but not always his name) had become known worldwide as a result of the mass production and distribution of cheap posters, prints and cards with reproductions of his distinctive beach paintings: he produced the first of these in what was to become recognised as his trademark style in 1992. The beach scenes had enormous market appeal and have become firmly established as iconic images which - now much imitated - apparently spawned a genre. The paintings themselves, which Miller continued to produce in large numbers until his death in 2002, became highly sought after and were only available through selected London galleries at successive annual exhibitions which usually sold out well before their official opening dates.\nJohn Miller was elected to become a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists in 1961. John Miller, a household name in Cornwall since the mid-1970s, is an artist whose work continues to have an extremely high public profile, both in the UK and internationally. In a 2003 survey (for the periodical 'Art Business Today') of 200 United Kingdom high street gallery owners whose businesses specialised in posters and popular art reproductions, Miller was listed alongside Monet and L.S. Lowry among the \u2018top-four\u2019 best-selling landscape artists and fifth - above Van Gogh (7th), Picasso (8th), and Matisse (10th) - in a list of the current \u2018top-ten\u2019 best-selling deceased artists in all genres. John Miller\u2019s work is currently (2004-5) the subject of academic investigation by a postgraduate student at the University of Kent, Canterbury, England.\nLondon art dealers Messums, who exhibited Miller's work during his lifetime, now handle the Artist's Estate. A major retrospective and accompanying catalogue are planned for May 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Miller", "response": ["John Miller may refer to:", "*John Miller (North Dakota politician) (1843\u20131908), Governor of North Dakota, 1889\u20131891", "*John Miller (Missouri politician) (1781\u20131846), Governor of Missouri, 1826\u20131832; U.S. Representative from Missouri, 1837\u20131843", "*John Miller (Washington politician) (1938\u20132017), U.S. Representative from Washington", "*John Miller (New York politician) (1774\u20131862), U.S. representative from New York", "*John Miller (Virginia politician) (1947\u20132016), State Senator from Virginia", "*John Miller (police official) (born 1958/9), New York Police Department official, former FBI official and former television host", "*John Miller (pseudonym), a pseudonym used by Donald Trump", "*John Miller (engineer) (1805\u20131883), MP for Edinburgh 1868\u20131874", "*Sir John Miller, 2nd Baronet (1665\u20131721), MP for Chichester 1698\u20131700, 1701\u20131705 and 1710\u20131713 and Sussex 1701", "*Sir John Miller, 3rd Baronet (1867\u20131918), Justice of the Peace and magistrate for Kent, 1889", "*John Miller (New South Wales politician) (1870\u20131934), New South Wales state MP", "*John Miller (South Australian politician) (1840\u20131919), member of the South Australian House of Assembly", "*John Miller (1865 Medal of Honor recipient) (1839\u20131882), Medal of Honor recipient", "*Sir John Miller (equerry) (1919\u20132006), British Lieutenant-Colonel and Crown Equerry", "*John Miller (American artist) (born 1954), American visual artist, writer and musician based in New York and Berlin", "*John Miller (Cornish artist) (1931\u20132002), English artist specializing in beach scenes", "*John Miller (botanical illustrator) (1715\u2013c. 1792), German engraver, painter, and botanist", "*John Miller (film producer), American film producer", "*John Miller (musician) (born 1945), Broadway music coordinator and actor", "*John Miller Jr. (born 1942), American bassoonist, principal of the Minnesota Orchestra", "*John Miller, a pseudonym of H.
