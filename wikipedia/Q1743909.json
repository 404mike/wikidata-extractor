He named Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Portion Control, and the album The Bridge by Thomas Leer and Robert Rental as early influences on Skinny Puppy. In an interview with Alternative Press, he mentioned Fad Gadget, The Human League, John Foxx, Bourbonese Qualk, and Mark Stewart as having a large impact on him in his youth.

In 1981, he signed to Cherry Red, his first release for the label being the 4 Movements EP.

The latter was inspired by J.G. Ballard's novel Crash. He called it The Normal to demystify and make it very bland and completed the package by setting up a record label for the release, Mute. He had researched how to make a single so he got some test pressings. Not knowing anything about retail or distribution he approached Rough Trade Records in Portobello Road, London. Originally a record outlet, Rough Trade had expanded into a label and distribution network. Miller took a test pressing into the shop to see if they would be interested in buying a box of them. Rough Trade Records boss Geoff Travis went to the back of the shop with Miller and played \"Warm Leatherette\". They loved the recording and helped him press 2000 copies of the single. \"Warm Leatherette\" was released in May 1978 and sold out very quickly. After receiving critical acclaim for the project Miller decided to explore further. He had been helping out at the Rough Trade Shop when he was given an offer of live work. Not wanting to perform alone, he formed a duo with the late Robert Rental who was recording material in a similar style at the time. The live event was hosted by DJ Colin Faver and included Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire. After that event, Miller and Rental took on a Rough Trade tour supporting Stiff Little Fingers. Miller and Rental went down very badly; Stiff Little Fingers were a traditional punk band supported by two people with synthesizers and a backing tape."]}, {"page": "Robert Donnachie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rental"]}, {"page": "List of Rough Trade artists", "response": ["* Robert Rental"]}, {"page": "The Grey Area of Mute Records discography", "response": ["==Thomas Leer & Robert Rental=="]}, {"page": "Rental, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Rental"]}, {"page": "Rental (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Robert Rental (1952\u20132000), British musician"]}]}}
