A member of the British Cycling Olympic Academy, he is a Junior World Team Sprint Champion for the second year running.Daniell began cycling after being spotted at his school in British Cycling's Go-Ride scheme. He was nominated for BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in 2006 and was awarded Junior Sport's Personality of the Year at the 11th annual Evening Gazette Sports Awards 2007.His first victory in a World Cup event was in October 2008, when he beat Yevhen Bolibrukh of the Ukraine. He took the victory in the kilo event with a time of 1:01.996, a clear margin of over a second over the rest of the field.After winning a silver medal in the Keirin at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Daniell underwent knee surgery that kept him out of training for 15 weeks. Subsequently, he badly twisted his leg while riding on the road in autumn 2012, resulting in him losing 40 percent of the cartilage in his joint. He was dropped from the British team before Christmas 2012 as he was not performing at the same level as before his injury.In 2013, he moved from Middlesbrough to East Kilbride, taking up a part-time position as a coach at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow. He has said that he aimed to qualify for the English team at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, but that he hoped to represent Scotland at the 2018 Commonwealth Games as he will have been resident in the country long enough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* David Daniell"]}, {"page": "Daniell", "response": ["* David Daniell (author) (1929\u20132016), biographer of William Tyndale", "* David Daniell (musician) (born 1972), American guitarist and composer", "* David Daniell (cyclist) (born 1989), English competitive cyclist"]}, {"page": "Christian Lyte", "response": [":1st team sprint, UCI World Track Championships, junior (with Jason Kenny & David Daniell)"]}, {"page": "David Daniell", "response": ["David Daniell may refer to:", "*David Daniell (musician) (born 1972), American guitarist and composer", "*David Daniell (cyclist) (born 1989), English competitive cyclist", "*David Daniell (author) (1929\u20132016), biographer of William Tyndale"]}, {"page": "British National Team Sprint Championships", "response": ["| 2006 || Composite AChris Hoy, Craig MacLean, Jason Queally || Scienceinsport.comMatthew Crampton, Jamie Staff, Ross Edgar || Composite DJason Kenny, David Daniell, Dave Le Grys", "| 2007 || ScotlandChris Hoy, Marco Librizzi, Ross Edgar || North West Region Jason Kenny, Christian Lyte, David Daniell || Yasumitsu Schlapp Jonathan Norfolk, Gwyn Carless, Anthony Gill", "| 2008 || Composite -
