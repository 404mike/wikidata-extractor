In his edition of Robert Davenport's King John and Matilda, he states that he was the last actor to play the heroine's part in that play, prior to the closing of the theatres in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. In his edition of Philip Massinger's The City Madam, he states that he acted in that play as well. So Pennycuicke must have been an actor c. 1638\u201342, up to the closing of the theatres; he was apparently a boy player who took women's roles, and a hired man rather than a sharer in any company. (Queen Henrietta's Men staged a late revival of the Davenport play, in 1638\u201339, while the Massinger work belonged to the King's Men. Pennycuicke could have worked for both companies at different times.)\nWith the closure of the theatres (which Pennycuicke himself termed \"the absurdity of times\"), many actors had to find other means of earning a living. Pennycuicke made the switch from actor to stationer, selling and publishing books. (Other ex-actors, Alexander Gough and William Cartwright, made the same career shift in the same era.) Pennycuicke's earliest known product was Robert Chamberlain's Nocturnal Lucubrations (1652). Given his prior career, it is not surprising that Pennycuicke concentrated on publishing plays, including:\n\nThe Fatal Contract by William Heminges, published 1653\nKing John and Matilda by Robert Davenport, 1655\nThe Sun's Darling, by Thomas Dekker and John Ford, 1656\nThe City Madam by Philip Massinger, 1658.Pennycuicke resided in the London parish of St. Giles in the Fields, the home of the Cockpit Theatre and of many actors and theatre men of the era, including William Beeston and fellow King's Man Theophilus Bird. Parish records show that Pennycuicke married Dorothy Kinde on 19 October 1647; their infant child was buried there on 4 December 1652.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "English Renaissance theatre", "response": ["*Andrew Pennycuicke"]}, {"page": "King's Men (playing company)", "response": ["Some company members chose alternative careers; Eliard Swanston became a jeweller, while hired men Alexander Gough and Andrew Pennycuicke became stationers."]}, {"page": "The City Madam", "response": ["The City Madam is a Caroline era comedy written by Philip Massinger. It was licensed by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 25 May 1632 and was acted by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre.The title page of the 1658 quarto specifies the Blackfriars; it is likely that the King's Men would have performed a popular play at their summer theatre, the Globe, as well\u2014but the Blackfriars had more prestige. It was printed in quarto in 1658 by the stationer Andrew Pennycuicke, who identified himself as \"one of the Actors\" in the play. A second edition followed in 1659. Pennycuicke dedicated the play (Massinger was long dead) to Ann, Countess of Oxford\u2014or at least most of the surviving copies bear a dedication to her; but others are dedicated to any one of four other individuals.Ann, daughter of Viscount Bayning and wife of Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford, died in 1659. Of the four other dedicatees, Thomas Freake was \"a wealthy Dorset knight,\" William Lee was an official in the Stationers Company; John Wrath and Richard Steadwell have not been identified.

The 1656 title page states that the play was \"often presented\" by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre; but it also makes the questionable claim that the play was \"often presented\" at Whitehall Palace \u2014 a claim dropped from the title page of the second quarto of 1657. If the work had a Court performance, it would in all likelihood have been once or at most twice, not \"often.\""]}, {"page": "John Rhodes (17th century)", "response": ["Rhodes was connected with the King's Men during the final phase of the development of English Renaissance drama. On 6 December 1624, Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, listed Rhodes among the \"necessary attendants,\" the hired men of the company, who could not be arrested or \"pressed for soldiers\" without the consent of the Master of the Revels or the Lord Chamberlain.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564\u20131964. Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 391. Rhodes served as the wardrobe-keeper at the Blackfriars Theatre.

The volume includes an epistle addressed \"To the knowning Reader\" that is signed with the initials \"R.

Heminges's primary source for plot materials was the General Inventory of the History of France by Jean de Serres, published in English in 1607.Mason, p. 121. The play was first printed in 1653, in a quarto issued by the actor turned stationer Andrew Pennycuicke. (The edition's preface is co-signed by \"A. T.,\" thought to be Anthony Turner.) The booksellers dedicated the play to the Earl and Countess of Nottingham. The prefatory matter in that edition indicates that Heminges was deceased by 1653.

In 1659, Turner got into trouble for acting in plays at the Red Bull Theatre, despite the official ban.Deborah C.

He was not the only actor who shifted to publishing; Andrew Pennycuicke and William Cartwright did the same. Most notably, Gough wrote an introduction to Humphrey Moseley's 1652 first edition of The Widow; his preface \"To the Reader\" re-iterated the title-page attribution of that play to John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and Thomas Middleton. Modern scholars and critics have strongly rejected the attribution to Fletcher and Jonson, and recognize The Widow as a solo work by Middleton.David J. Lake, The Canon of Thomas Middleton's Plays, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1975; pp. 38-43."]}, {"page": "William Cartwright (actor)", "response": ["For the years 1642\u20131660, when the theatres were closed, evidence of the activities of the former actors is scanty.
