Early on, they scored a worldwide hit with the song \"United We Stand\". By 1973 the concept had run its course and Hiller formed a definite four-member line-up consisting of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens. This version of the group went on to score many hits around the world in the mid to late 1970s including \"Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby\", \"Angelo\", \"Oh Boy (The Mood I'm In)\" and \"Figaro\". They achieved perhaps their biggest success in their native UK with three number one singles and four top twenty albums. The group under this line-up still continues, performing shows throughout Europe. Altogether, they have released 16 studio albums, with worldwide sales topping 15 million records.", "Brotherhood of Man was formed by record producer/composer Tony Hiller in 1969, and originally featured his co-writer John Goodison with Tony Burrows, Roger Greenaway, Sue Glover and Sunny Leslie. Greenaway was also a songwriter and had co-written hits such as \"Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart\" and \"Melting Pot\". Burrows was a well-known session singer, performing in various line-ups on hit singles such as the No.1 hit \"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\" by Edison Lighthouse. The two female members, Glover and Leslie were an act in their own right, releasing singles as Sue and Sunny.", "\"...\"Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby\" was a hit all over Europe in '75. I firmly believe it opened the door for us a year later and helped us do well because they knew us \u2013 every weekend we'd travel to do TV spots in France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland\".Tony Hiller interview with Michael Heatley, 1995", "Manager Tony Hiller set up his own record company in 1980, Dazzle Records. Brotherhood of Man released the first single on the label, \"Honey Don't Throw Our Love Away\" which also did not chart, nor did the follow-up, a cover of the 1960s hit \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\". An album was recorded but went unreleased, except for in Australia. Towards the end of the year, the group were offered a deal with Warwick Records to make an album of cover versions. Released in November, Sing 20 Number One Hits was the group's take on 20 number one UK hits from recent years. The album was a hit, peaking at No.14 \u2013 their biggest chart success for two years. The album remained in the top 50 for two months and was awarded a gold disc for sales of over 100,000. Keen to release a follow-up, Warwick offered them a double album deal the following year. Released as a buy one get one free package, 20 Disco Greats / 20 Love Songs \u2013 again, a collection of recent chart hits, came out in late 1981. This album did not match the success of the first and missed the UK Charts. Tracks from these albums appear frequently on CD releases of the group, interspersed with their own hit singles.", "*Tony Hiller Official Website"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Tony Hiller, Lee Sheriden & Martin Lee"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982", "response": ["| 04 || align=\"left\" | Lovin' Feeling || align=\"left\" | \"Different Worlds and Different People\" || align=\"left\" | Tony Hiller, Paul Curtis || 60 || 4th"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983", "response": ["Of the entries, songwriters Tony Hiller, Martin Lee and Paul Curtis had had songs in the Eurovision final before.

When the Kissing Stops, written by Martin Lee and Barry Upton of Brotherhood of Man together with their longtime writing partner Tony Hiller (who had co-written Save Your Kisses For Me with Lee), was originally intended for the group themselves, but they decided it would be best not to risk losing and thus not to take part; although all four members of the group attended the broadcast. The group did go on to record the song however and it featured on their album Lightning Flash. The writers of Keeping Our Love Alive, Doug Flett and Guy Fletcher had written many previous UK finalists, including the 1973 winner Power to All Our Friends.

The three vocalists had been the Merrie Men backing Robbie Hood (A.K.A Mike West, previously co-singer with Fred Heath in Johnny Kidd & The Pirates). The Fortunes were originally backed by an instrumental group known as the Cliftones, and the band placed an instrumental track on a compilation album, Brumbeat, issued by the local Dial record label. \"Cygnet Twitch\" was a working of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", and they subsequently signed to British Decca in 1963. Their first single, \"Summertime, Summertime\", was credited to the Fortunes and the Cliftones. However, the vocalists picked up guitars, jettisoned the Cliftones, and added Andy Brown on drums, and Dave Carr on keyboards. The follow-up disc \"Caroline\", co-written by the singer-songwriter and future Ivy League member Perry Ford and songwriter Tony Hiller, is still in use as the signature tune for the pirate radio station, Radio Caroline."]}]}}
