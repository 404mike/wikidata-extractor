Nesbitt (full name unknown, occasionally referred to as Nisbitt in some reports) was a footballer who played for Sheffield United as a defender during the 1891\u201392 season.  Little else is known about him, with no surviving contemporary records or documents as to his full identity.  Nesbitt was registered by United in the summer of 1891 and played in 29 games during the course of the season, although the majority of them were friendly fixtures.  He did make five competitive starts in the Northern League and a further two in the FA Cup before being released the following summer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1892\u201393 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["With United set to play in the newly formed Football League Second Division the club looked to strengthen its squad, as a number of fringe players departed Bramall Lane.  Squad players William Getliff and W. Nesbitt were not retained, and long-serving defender Ned Stringer retired from playing to take up a scouting post with the club.  Billy Bairstow was allowed to join local side Penistone, while Thomas Smith's brief stay with the club came to an end as he was signed by Yorkshire neighbours Barnsley."]}]}}
