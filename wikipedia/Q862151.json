Appearing as last-minute replacements for fellow EMI artists Queen, who had dropped out because of Freddie Mercury's dental appointment, the band and their entourage were offered drinks as they waited to go on air. During the interview, Jones said the band had \"fucking spent\" its label advance and Rotten used the word \"shit\", although both of these statements were apparently inaudible to Grundy, who had earlier claimed to be drunk. He then engaged in repartee with Siouxsie Sioux, who declared that she had \"always wanted to meet\" him. Grundy responded, \"Did you really? We'll meet afterwards, shall we?\" This prompted the following exchange between Jones and the host:", "Attacks on punk fans rose and in mid-June Rotten was assaulted by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington's Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm. Jamie Reid and Paul Cook were beaten up in other incidents; three days after the Pegasus assault, Rotten was attacked again.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 365\u2013366. According to Cook, after the God Save The Queen single and the Bill Grundy incident, the Pistols were public enemy number one, and there was a rivalry between gangs of rockabillies or Teddie Boys and the punks which resulted in many fights. A tour of Scandinavia, planned to start at the end of the month, was delayed until mid-July. In Oslo, Lydon posed for photographs by making the Nazi salute while wearing a sweater with a Swastika. During the tour, a Swedish interviewer told Jones that \"a lot of people\" regarded the band as McLaren's \"creation\". Jones replied, \"He's our manager, that's all. He's got nothing to do with the music or the image...he's just a good manager.\" In another interview, Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group: \"I don't understand it.

While some of the Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not\u2014including what McLaren himself cites as the \"pivotal moment that changed everything\", the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show.See, for instance, Temple's commentary: \"[It] was not planned at all. It was totally spontaneous. And as the band will tell you, Malcolm said, 'You've blown it. You've ruined everything I've worked for'\" (Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 27:26\u201327:33); and Matlock's confirmation (Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 145, 147). Concerning the time the band spent waiting to go on air, Siouxsie Sioux later said, \"I've got a feeling that Malcolm was geeing them up, stirring it a bit\" (Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 257). Her view is belied by the version of the incident in Phil Strongman's Pretty Vacant, which appears to rely on McLaren himself (pp. 154\u2013155). According to Strongman, McLaren \"was inconsolable\" (p. 154). \"Malcolm milked situations\", says Cook, \"he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 338. It is also hard to ascribe the effect of the Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren \"was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of what he was up to as he has since made out.\"Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, p. 170. By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 198."]}, {"page": "1976", "response": ["** The Sex Pistols achieve public notoriety, as they unleash several four-letter words live on Bill Grundy's early evening TV show."]}, {"page": "Queen (band)", "response": ["On 1 December 1976, Queen were the intended guests on London's early evening Today programme, but they pulled out at the last-minute, which saw their late replacement on the show, EMI labelmate the Sex Pistols, give their infamous expletive-strewn interview with Bill Grundy.

He arranged the Sex Pistols' notorious, expletive-filled appearance on the Today television show in 1976 presented by Bill Grundy.

The documentary then shows clips from the 1996 controversy on TFI Friday during which singer Shaun Ryder and actor Ewan McGregor both said \"fuck\" on the live early-evening show. This caused it to become pre-recorded, and Shaun Ryder's name to be put on the official Channel 4 charter forbidding him from appearing live on the channel. Ryder, in fact, swore 14 times during his live performance of \"Pretty Vacant\" - a song originally by the Sex Pistols. Its publishers, however, prevented Ryder's version of the song from being used in The TV They Tried to Ban, and an on-screen message here calls them \"Spoilsports\"."]}, {"page": "Seven Ages of Rock", "response": ["The VH1 broadcast was substantially different from the BBC.

According to their author, Joe Strummer, the lyrics were sparked by his disgust at the erection of fences in Britain's football terraces, built to keep fans apart in response to football hooliganism. Ten years later the Hillsborough Disaster would prove these fences fatal and his concerns irrefutably correct. The 'King of Early Evening ITV' mentioned in the song is confirmed as Bill Grundy, whose career was ruined after his infamous interview with the Sex Pistols and was indeed presenting early evening television on British terrestrial channel ITV. \"I can remember his first appearance now look what's happened to him, so they put him in a dog suit like from 1964\" is about singer-songwriter Elvis Costello."]}, {"page": "Festival of the Tenth Summer", "response": ["#G-Mex \u2013 The Tenth Event, an all day festival featuring A Certain Ratio, The Smiths, New Order, The Fall, Cabaret Voltaire, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Pete Shelley/Buzzcocks, Luxuria, The Worst, Sandie Shaw, John Cale, John Cooper Clarke and Margi Clarke.
