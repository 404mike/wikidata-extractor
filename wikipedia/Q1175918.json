Afterwards, Jack Kirkland, a director, warned Clough and Taylor there would be no more expensive buys like Nish. Then, on 3 September 1972, after the team had defeated Liverpool 2\u20131 at the Baseball Ground, Clough criticised the Derby County fans, stating that \"They started chanting only near the end when we were a goal in front. I want to hear them when we are losing. They are a disgraceful lot\". In the same interview, Clough also verbally attacked the club's board of directors for their policies. The following day, board chairman Sam Longson apologised to the fans and dissociated himself from Clough's remarks."]}, {"page": "Burton upon Trent", "response": ["* David Nish, (born 1947) former Leicester City and Derby County footballer who broke the British transfer record in 1972.SoccerBase Database retrieved 24 August 2018"]}, {"page": "Tulsa Roughnecks (1978\u20131984)", "response": ["* David Nish (1979)"]}, {"page": "Shepshed Dynamo F.C.", "response": ["* David Nish"]}, {"page": "Ashby School", "response": ["* David Nish, footballer, capped five times for England"]}]}}
