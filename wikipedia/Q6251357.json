The 1976\u201377 season started well for Ipswich with victories over Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich then achieved a club record-equalling 7\u20130 win over West Bromwich Albion: the Albion goalkeeper John Osborne said of Beattie's long-range goal that he regarded himself as fortunate he had not touched it as it would have knocked his hand off.Finch, p. 80. Beattie's season was prematurely curtailed by a self-inflicted injury:Finch, p. 82. stoking a bonfire at his home, he decided to add petrol; the ensuing flare-up gave him serious burns to his face and neck,Finch, p. 84. leading to him missing six matches. Before the injury, Ipswich were challenging for the league title, but, in Beattie's absence, the side lost four of their last six matches and missed out on winning the championship by five points.
