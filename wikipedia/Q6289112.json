His second Oxford goal was an uncharacteristic scissor-kick against Rochdale that left keeper Josh Lillis stunned.

Logan saved a penalty in Rochdale's 3\u20132 victory over Leyton Orient on 27 September, a feat he would replicate in the next game, saving Conor Hourihane's last minute penalty, although it couldn't prevent a 1\u20130 loss to Barnsley.

Following the match, manager Keith Hill confirmed that Logan had suffered a 'serious' injury and Logan himself later tweeted that his loan spell had ended due to the injury.
