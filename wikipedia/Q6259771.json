The title track features guest vocals from Toyah fans camping outside the recording studio, who were spontaneously invited in to chant \"love is the law\" in the song's chorus. \"I Explode\" was inspired by the idea that Crowley was so powerful as a Satanic person that he managed to explode and disappear, and is \"about intense emotions that destroy the essence of who you are\".
