He played for Sussex from 1981 to 1996, where he was captain from 1992 to 1996. He then played for Kent from 1997 to 2000. In total he played 376 first-class matches in a career spanning twenty seasons, with a batting average of 38.57 and a top score of 253 not out (against Yorkshire at Middlesbrough in 1991).He only played twice for England, once in a Test match (where he was dismissed for a golden duck by the West Indian fast bowler Curtly Ambrose), and once in a One Day International. In 1989\u201390, Wells joined the rebel tour of South Africa.\nDuring the winter of 1994\u201395, Wells led England 'A' to a long and highly successful tour of the Indian subcontinent. They convincingly won the three unofficial tests against their Indian counterparts. The three-match One-Day series was much closer, but still England 'A' emerged victorious (2\u20131). Wells produced his best in the 2nd 'Test' at the Eden Gardens, Calcutta. There, he scored 93 & 65. The Indian leg was followed by a short tour of Bangladesh in mid-February. England 'A' won the two One-Day matches, while the 3-Day match was drawn.Wells' able leadership was a key factor in the success of the tour. It was a great learning experience for some of the young England players. Some of them, like, Nick Knight, Michael Vaughan, Dominic Cork, Jason Gallian, went on to play for the main England outfit.\nHis brother, Colin Wells, also played for Sussex and England (In two One Day Internationals).\nAlan Wells is now director of cricket at St Bede's School, Hailsham.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dynamic Tension", "response": ["The story may be apocryphal, but it captures the essence of Atlas's innovation.
