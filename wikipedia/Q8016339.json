Though keen to secure a diplomatic appointment, nothing was offered to him and, as a practising Anglican, he instead busied himself with church affairs in Canberra. In July 1962, the government gave him responsibility for organising Queen Elizabeth II's upcoming royal tour. In this role he was required to liaise with the state governments to plan the Queen's itinerary, and to become a member of the royal household for the duration of the tour, the first time an Australian tour planner had been given such close access to a visiting monarch. He was rewarded with appointment as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) as of 27\u00a0March 1963, and became Australian Secretary to the Queen on 1\u00a0November the same year. Dowling was also the Australian Red Cross Society's Canberra chairman from 1962 to 1967; at the time he took over the chairmanship, Lady Dowling was acting president of the organisation, in the absence of Lady William Oliver. Roy Dowling died of a heart attack on 15\u00a0April 1969 in Canberra Hospital. He was given a naval funeral at St John's Church, and cremated. His wife and five children survived him."]}, {"page": "List of commandants of Berlin Sectors", "response": ["| Lt Gen William Oliver"]}, {"page": "William Oliver", "response": ["William Oliver may refer to:", "*William Oliver (songwriter) (1800\u20131848), Newcastle upon Tyne born songwriter", "*William Oliver (footballer) (1892\u2013?), English footballer", "*William Oliver (physician) (1695\u20131764), inventor of the Bath Oliver biscuit", "*William Oliver (mayor) (1860\u20131951), mayor of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada", "*William Oliver (Northern Ireland politician) (1912\u20131973), MP in the Northern Ireland Parliament for Belfast Dock", "*William Oliver (British Army officer) (1901\u20131981), British general", "*Sir William Oliver (1885\u20131962), Scottish business advisor", "*William Oliver (artist) (1823-1901), born William Oliver Williams, English artist."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*1965: Walter Cheshire, Alexander Gordon, James Miller, William Oliver"]}, {"page": "1965 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* William Oliver Davies, Director of Public Works, Bechuanaland Protectorate."]}, {"page": "Vice Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Sir William Oliver 1955\u20131957"]}, {"page": "General Oliver", "response": ["*William Oliver (British Army officer) (1901\u20131981), British Army lieutenant general"]}]}}
