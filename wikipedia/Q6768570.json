He became a first team regular in the early nineties and was part of the team that won promotion via the Football League Division Two play-off final and the Football League Trophy during the 1997\u201398 season. Lever spent the first twelve years of his career with Grimsby and departed the club in 2000 when he joined Bristol City. Injuries prevented him from making a real impact at Ashton Gate and after two years he moved on again to Mansfield Town. In 2003, he dropped out of professional football and joined Non-league Ilkeston Town before finishing his career in 2004 whilst on loan with Ossett Albion.\nIn 2008, he was appointed to the coaching staff of Bridlington Town, briefly making the step up to manager in 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["1987\u201388 saw Grimsby Town suffer a second consecutive relegation, placing them in the Fourth Division. The club's financial situation was also dismal, and as the 1988\u201389 season began, the task at Grimsby was to avoid relegation to the Football Conference, avoid expulsion from the FA and avoid going out of business completely. This was achieved, finishing 9th. Following the resignation of Dave Booth in 1986 (to pursue outside business interests) the club had two managers in two years (Mick Lyons and Bobby Roberts). Alan Buckley was appointed after the 1988 relegation and by 1991 had led the club to two successive promotions with the chairman at that time being Peter Furneaux. Grimsby were to remain in football's second flight for six years. Buckley's crop of players consisting of some of the most popular and biggest cult heroes in the club's history; players such as Shaun Cunnington, Keith Alexander, Mark Lever, Dave Gilbert, Steve Livingstone, Paul Futcher, Paul Groves and Clive Mendonca made the club a solid second-tier side (the Second Division became Division One in 1992 upon the creation of the Premier League from the old First Division). In 1992\u201393, Grimsby finished 9th in the new Division One, and until well into April they were in the hunt for a play-off place that would have given them the chance of a third promotion in four years. They dipped to 16th place a year later, though they were never in any real danger of relegation.", "|1989|| Shaun Cunnington || Mark Lever", "|1991|| Dave Gilbert || Mark Lever", "|2000|| Mark Lever || Danny Butterfield"]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Mark Lever||||CB||1987\u20131999||361||8"]}, {"page": "Steve Chettle", "response": ["Following one season with Burton, Chettle moved down the non-league footballing ladder, signing for Ilkeston Town in July 2004. Chettle featured at centre back that season with notably forming a formidable partnership with long serving ex Grimsby defender Mark Lever. This would eventually be both players' final season, and Chettle decided to retire from competitive football at the end of the 2004\u201305 season."]}, {"page": "Lee Matthews (footballer)", "response": ["On 15 March he joined Bristol City on loan, after coming off the bench the next day to score against Millwall in a 2\u20131 win at Ashton Gate, he was signed permanently for \u00a3100,000 (initially \u00a370,000, with a maximum bonus of \u00a335,000 dependent on appearances) on 20 March. Three days later he did the same thing in a 3\u20131 win at Reading, his goal coming three minutes after coming onto the pitch. A semi-regular in 2001\u201302, he scored just five goals, though Two of these came in a Bristol derby game on 9 January, City celebrating a 3\u20130 home win in the Football League Trophy. He also scored in City's Severnside derby victory over Cardiff City. However, he missed many games that season due to injury, including an ankle injury which required surgery. In April 2002 he was transfer listed by manager Danny Wilson, along with Mickey Bell, Mark Lever, Steve Jones and Simon Clist."]}, {"page": "Richard Smith (footballer, born 1970)", "response": ["In September 1995, Smith was loaned to fellow First Division side Grimsby Town. He would make 8 appearances for Brian Laws side during this spell which led to him joining the club permanently in March 1996 when Leicester and Grimsby agreed a \u00a350,000 transfer fee. In his time at Grimsby he was in and out of the team both under Laws and his replacement Alan Buckley. The Mariners defensive set up in the mid to late nineties had boasted such club legends as Mark Lever, Peter Handyside, John McDermott, Graham Rodger and Kevin Jobling, so Smith was dipped in and out of the first team. The club were eventually relegated to the Second Division in May 1997, only to bounce back the following season by winning the Second Division Play-Off Final at Wembley Stadium. Town had also triumphed in the Football League Trophy that season, but injury had forced Smith to miss the entire season."]}, {"page": "Tony Gallimore", "response": ["At Blundell Park he would turn out to be the club's long-term replacement for departing left back Gary Croft who had left Grimsby in a multimillion-pound deal to join Blackburn Rovers. After playing out the last few games of the 1995\u201396 campaign, Gallimore would prepare himself for a tough first full season, with The Mariners losing their first division status, and suffering a relegation, this spelled the end of an era at the club and important key players such as John Oster and Clive Mendonca moved on to new clubs. In the 1997\u201398 season, Gallimore would play an important role in the club's sudden return to the first division, whilst beating Northampton Town at Wembley Stadium in the play-offs, the club also defeated AFC Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy at the same venue. Gallimore along with fellow defenders John McDermott, Peter Handyside and Mark Lever as well as goalkeeper Aidan Davison were noted as the strongest defensive line up in the Second Division that year, and one of the strongest in the whole country. Gallimore went on to play the next five seasons at Grimsby and featured as the club's main choice left back until his departure at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, when Grimsby were to lose their first division status once more. Injury had troubled Gallimore in parts of his last couple of seasons with Grimsby, and his place had been contested by youngster Ben Chapman and also with the arrival of Darren Barnard in 2002, Gallimore had struggled to hold his place down in the team. With the club relegated, Grimsby opted not to renew his contract and he left the club after featuring in seven different seasons for The Mariners."]}, {"page": "Peter Handyside", "response": ["Handyside was trialed by Grimsby Town and was signed by the club's youth team in 1990. He took his step up into the first team in 1992 and was eventually the club's long term replacement for veteran centre back Paul Futcher and made an excellent pairing with Mark Lever. Handyside's maturity grew and he became an integral part of Grimsby's defensive setup, and along with Lever, John McDermott, Tony Gallimore, Graham Rodger, Kevin Jobling and Richard Smith was part of arguably Grimsby's best ever defence. The 1997\u20131998 Handyside continued to be the nucleus of Town's strong defence that helped achieve a promotion to back to the First Division via the play-offs, and victory in the Football League Trophy. He bowed out at Grimsby after the 2000\u201301 season. An injury troubled campaign, he was often replaced by loan signing Zhang Enhua. At the end of the season, he rejected the chance to stay on with Grimsby and moved to Second Division Stoke City."]}, {"page": "Lever (surname)", "response": ["*Mark Lever (born 1970), English former professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Football League Trophy", "response": ["|DF ||5 ||Mark Lever"]}, {"page": "1998 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|CB ||5||Mark Lever"]}]}}
