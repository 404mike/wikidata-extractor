Before nightfall he had discerned that the ships were enemies, but heavy fog made it impossible to determine their disposition until just after midday on 31\u00a0August, when it became clear that one of them was a 74\u00a0gunner and together, they were more than a match for Boadicea. He nevertheless continued to close and tested the Frenchmen's resolve with a broadside. After an ineffectual but vocal reply had revealed to him that the French ships were fully manned and armed, Maitland brought his ship about and began to escape. The French attempted to pursue but were unable to catch Boadicea, eventually returning to their original course."]}, {"page": "Maitland", "response": ["*John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (1537\u20131595), Lord Chancellor of Scotland", "*John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale (1616\u20131682), Scottish politician, and leader within the Cabal Ministry", "*John Maitland (British Army officer) (1732\u20131779), British military officer", "*John Maitland (Royal Navy officer) (1771\u20131836), Royal Navy admiral", "*John Maitland (Conservative politician) (1903\u20131977), British politician in the Conservative party (Tory)"]}, {"page": "Action of 5 November 1813", "response": ["| align = left |Captain John Maitland"]}, {"page": "Battle of Cape Ortegal", "response": ["Baker kept ahead of the pursuing French, and at 3 o'clock that afternoon he sighted four sails heading south.

Having ascertained the strength and disposition of the French ships, Baker resumed sailing to the south-east, firing guns and signalling to the four ships he had seen and supposed to be British. Dumanoir's forces had already had a run-in with the British, having been chased by two frigates, the 38-gun  under Captain John Maitland, and the 36-gun  under Captain Adam Drummond. Boadicea and Dryad sighted Phoenix and the four sails to the south at 8.45 that evening, and made signals to them. Baker was suspicious of the new sails, standing between him and the French ships, and so did not stand towards them, instead continuing on to the sails in the south. By now it was clear on Boadicea and Dryad that a substantial force was gathering, as Phoenix closed with four ships of the line, and three other sails were also sighted in the vicinity. They eventually drew to within two miles of the weather-most ship, the 80-gun HMS Caesar, but received no reply to their signals, and drew away at 10.30pm, where after they lost sight of both the French and British ships, and took no further part in the battle."]}, {"page": "James Richard Dacres (Royal Navy officer, born 1788)", "response": ["He was next reported aboard the 38-gun frigate , serving in the English Channel under Captain John Maitland.

Maitland decided to test whether the French ships were armed en fl\u00fbte and were being used as troopships, and closing to within range, opened fire.

The convoy was sailing to Britain from Gibraltar, escorted by the 64-gun  under Captain Robert Redmill and the frigate  under Captain William Prowse. Heavily outnumbered, the convoy turned away and ran before the wind, Willaumez in close pursuit.

Throughout the following day, Boadicea followed the French squadron, losing them during the night of 30 August in a fog, but rediscovering them at 13:30 on 31 August when the wind shifted from the west to the northeast. Maitland could now see that Duguay-Trouin was a ship of the line, but was also aware that weakened ships were travelling to Europe from Saint-Domingue and consequently closed with Touffet's force, firing on his ship from a distance of  at 14:00, the French ship of the line returning fire. The fire from Duguay-Trouin was fierce enough that, in combination with the approaching Guerri\u00e8re, Maitland considered that they were too powerful for Boadicea to effectively fight and he sheered away, briefly followed by the French ships. At 14:50 however, with Boadicea rapidly widening the gap between the forces, Touffet abandoned the chase, turning southwards towards Ferrol.James, p. 193"]}, {"page": "HMS Kingfisher (1782)", "response": ["In April 1797 Commander John Maitland took command. On 1 August he was almost the victim of a mutiny. Taking a direct approach he gathered his officers and marines and attacked the mutineers with swords and cutlasses, killing and wounding several. This decisive action quashed the mutiny, and was approved of by his commanding officer, Admiral John Jervis. Jervis described Maitland's actions as 'Doctor Maitland's recipe', and advised that it should be adopted in future instances of attempted mutiny.  Maitland was promoted to post-captain on 11 August 1797 and was given command of , one of the prizes captured by Nelson at the Battle of Cape St Vincent.  Before his transfer he had time to repeat Kingfishers success against privateers, capturing the 2-gun privateer Espoir on 15 September that year. Maitland was replaced by Commander Charles Pierrepoint, who had even more success. The 16-gun privateer Betsey was captured on 8 January 1798, followed by the 10-gun privateer Lynx on 15 March 1798.
