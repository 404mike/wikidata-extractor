He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations, eventually rising to become chairman of nine different British railway companies.\nAmong his more notable projects were his expansion of the Metropolitan Railway, part of today's London Underground; the construction of the Great Central Main Line, a purpose-built high-speed railway line; the creation of a pleasure garden with a partially constructed iron tower at Wembley and a failed attempt to dig a Channel Tunnel under the English Channel to connect his railway empire to the French rail network.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
