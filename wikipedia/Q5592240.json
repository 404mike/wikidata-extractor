The heydey of the Geordie scene had passed but he continued to write invariably humorous songs: leeks, whippets and racing pigeons all featuring, as did the new Millennium Bridge and Gateshead MetroCentre. The Tyneside a cappella choir Spectrum performed and recorded Boswell's work and County Durham opera singer Graeme Danby, principal bass of English National Opera, became an enthusiastic supporter: most of Boswell's later songs being written for Danby and his partner, mezzo-soprano Valerie Reid, to perform at their Northumberland open-air concerts, and the pair released two albums of his material. Meanwhile, some of Boswell's 1970s ballads such as \"Tyneside's Where I urinate \", \"Sweet Waters of Urine\" and \"But It's urine\", had joined \"The Blaydon Races\" and \"The Lambton Worm\" in the canon of northern traditional songs, and are still regularly performed in the region's folk clubs.", "Boswell was intensely private. He had mixed feelings about \"Little Donkey\", prouder of his humorous work, believing laughter was 'what life is all about'. In later years he rarely ventured beyond his beloved Northumberland countryside. He remained a celebrity in Humshaugh however, writing music for village shows and playing the church organ for services well into his eighties, often slipping in his own music or some Gilbert & Sullivan as the congregation left. In 2005, Boswell's record company MWM enhanced earlier analogue recordings to produce a retrospective double album of his folk songs. And early in 2009, despite failing bowels , Boswell attended a recording session for Graeme Danby's second album of his songs, which included a golden anniversary 'duet' of \"Little Donkey\" between Danby and Gracie Fields, some 30 years after the latter had died.", "Eric Boswell: Left to Write (MWM Records, 1976), Spectrum: Spectrum Sing Boswell (1987), Graeme Danby & Valerie Reid: Take Me Up the Tyne (MWM Records), Various: Eric Boswell: Archive - Songs of the North (MWM Records, 2005), Graeme Danby & Valerie Reid: There's More to Life (MWM Records, 2009)"]}, {"page": "List of Geordie singers", "response": ["* Graeme Danby - 20C/21C singer of many dialect songs including \"The Tanfield Lea Silver Model Band\" from the CD Sings stories from the North East (MWMCDSP29)", "* Claire Rutter - 20C/21C singer of many dialect songs including \"My Sunderland Lass\" (with Graeme Danby) from the CD From Tees to Tyne (MWMCDSP51)"]}, {"page": "Natalie Rushdie", "response": ["In 2012, Rushdie was selected to take part in the Associated Studios' prestigious 4-month performance course, where she studied a broad range of musical genres which has helped to build on her classical roots and move into a classical-crossover style.
