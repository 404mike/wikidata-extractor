The SF Site gave a positive review and commented that the book was well suited to general audiences and was a good primer for people looking for an introduction to the book's themes.

Faced with the prospect of eternity, that's not enough to satisfy.\" The Globe and Mail was also mixed in their opinion, writing \"At its best, Hanlon's book offers the fascination and sense of wonder of good science fiction. At its worst, it reads like an earnest United Nations report on the challenges to be overcome in the 21st century. Luckily, there's more best than worst here.\""]}]}}
