Born to Dutch parents, jhr. Hendrik Barthout van Tets, heer van Goidschalxoord and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se van Heukelom, in London on 19 January 1929, Van Tets spent his childhood in the Netherlands. Following World War II, he moved to England to complete his schooling at Hazelmere. He completed two years of national service with the Royal Engineers in England and Austria before emigrating to Canada where he studied at the University of Toronto (1952\u201354) and the University of British Columbia (1954-1963), obtaining his PhD in 1963. He became a member of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1958. In November 1963, he married Patricia Anne Johnston in Vancouver, British Columbia, moving shortly thereafter to Australia, where he joined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in the Division of Wildlife and Ecology, now the Division of Sustainable Ecosystems.\nVan Tets swam for the swimming teams of British Troops Austria, the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia.\nVan Tets received recognition for his studies on bird strike damage to aircraft, and later for his studies of the bird bones in the Australian National Wildlife Collection, including those of the extinct Tasman booby which he described scientifically in 1988, and became a specialist authority on the mutton bird and the cormorant family. Together with Michael Crowley, Chris Davey, Peter Fullagar, Ederic Slater, Petrus Heyligers and others, Van Tets helped to establish and maintain a long term ecological study on Montague Island, NSW. Van Tets served as compiler for the first four bird (Aves) volumes of the Zoological Catalogue of Australia and as a sub-editor for behaviour for the first three volumes of the Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds.\nOn retirement in 1988, Van Tets  continued to work as a research fellow and as curator of osteology for the Australian National Wildlife Collection and the Faunal Reference Collection of the Prehistory Department of the Australian National University.  He died in Canberra, Australia on 14 January 1995. Van Tets was survived by his wife and three children, Janet Bradly, Ian van Tets and Kit Cassidy.\nThe extinct New Zealand stiff-tailed duck, Oxyura vantetsi, was named in his honour.\nThe Gerard Frederick van Tets Field Research Station on Montague Island, NSW was named in recognition of Jerry's work there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dominic Serventy", "response": ["Dominic Serventy is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Australian lizard, Ctenotus serventyi.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

It is possible that the population fluctuated from the initial settlement of the island in 1888 to the 1970s, with reports of a minor decline. In 1975, ornithologist Gerard Frederick van Tets guessed the total population to be 20 to 200 birds. A 2000 survey estimated the breeding population to be 1,000, and predicted that, due to the rapid spread of the invasive yellow crazy ant, there would be an 80% decline in the pigeon's population over the next 12 years, making it critically endangered. Conversely, a 2003 survey estimated 35,000\u201366,000 individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the population as 5,000 mature individuals, and the pigeon is considered to be common with no major concerns of decline."]}, {"page": "New Zealand stiff-tailed duck", "response": ["The New Zealand stiff-tailed duck was closely related to the Australian blue-billed duck (Oxyura australis) but its bones were about one tenth smaller than those of its Australian relative. The holotype was found in 1967 at Lake Poukawa in Hawke's Bay, North Island, New Zealand and remains in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The specific name honours the late Australian ornithologist Gerard Frederick van Tets (1929\u20131995) who first recognized the relationship of this species with the stiff-tailed ducks in 1983. Because the bones of the New Zealand stiff-tailed duck were unlabeled, it was not until 2004 that Trevor H. Worthy from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa identified 19 bones out of 13,000 fossil remains of waterfowl found in the Holocene deposits at Lake Poukawa. The fossil remains consist of left humeri, distal left humeri, right humeri, distal right humeri, and proximal right humeri. The New Zealand stiff-tailed duck presumably became extinct due to overhunting by the M\u0101ori in the 16th century."]}, {"page": "Jerry van Tets", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerard Frederick van Tets"]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* Gerard Frederick van Tets (England / Canada / Australia, 1929-1995)"]}, {"page": "Gerard van Tets", "response": ["#Redirect Gerard Frederick van Tets"]}, {"page": "Microcarbo serventyorum", "response": [" Microcarbo serventyorum, also referred to as Serventys' cormorant, is an extinct species of small cormorant from the Holocene of Australia.

The pelvic features indicate that the bird was adept at foraging in confined wetlands such as swamps with dense vegetation, small pools and narrow streams.
