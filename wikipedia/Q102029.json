Her illustrations\u2014under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer\u2014were used for Danish editions of The Lord of the Rings, which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to J. R. R. Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist Eric Fraser for the Folio Society's English edition of The Lord of the Rings, first published in 1977 and reissued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's poetry collection Cantabile. She is also an accomplished translator and is said to have participated in the Danish translation of The Lord of the Rings.  Another skill she possesses is costume designing, having designed the costumes for the Royal Danish Ballet's production of A Folk Tale and for the 2009 Peter Flinth film, De vilde svaner (The Wild Swans). She also designs her own clothes and is known for her colourful and sometimes eccentric clothing choices. Margrethe also wears designs by former Pierre Balmain designer Erik Mortensen, J\u00f8rgen Bender, and Birgitte Taulow. The Guardian in March 2013 listed her as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s.

In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of The Lord of the Rings, mostly in coloured ink, by the English artist Mary Fairburn; Tolkien said of her pictures: \"They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me.... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.\" For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn's illustrations were unknown until 2012.Tankard, Paul, \"An Unknown Vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn: Tolkien Illustrator\", Times Literary Supplement, 14 September 2012. http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece Crown Princess Margrethe (now Queen Margrethe II) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to create illustrations to The Lord of the Rings in the early 1970s.

She maintained the organisational skills developed during this period throughout her life, accumulating a large library of reference material. While in Oxford, she took some classes at Oxford School of Art under William Roberts and Bernard Meninsky, and it was then that she decided to become an illustrator. Other illustrators who influenced her were Rex Whistler and Eric Fraser. After she was demobbed in December 1946, Jaques attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, until 1948, supported by an ex-service grant.
