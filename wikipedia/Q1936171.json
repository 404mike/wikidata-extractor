From its very first advertising campaigns, developed together with Emanuele Pirella, the brand developed a pioneering concept in an area where advertising aimed at plus-size women was nonexistent.

Marina Rinaldi was the first to introduce the Italian expression taglia comoda (\u201cplus-size\u201d, literally, \u201ccomfortable size\u201d), replacing the traditional term taglia forte (\u201coutsize\u201d) which had been used until then to describe this type of product.
