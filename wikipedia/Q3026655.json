Gould lost the team captaincy for the first match to Frank Hill, a game which Wales lost to Scotland 5\u20131, though Gould did score his first international try. The game is also notable for featuring the first appearance of Billy Bancroft, the Swansea all-round sportsman who would take over the captaincy from Gould on his retirement. Bancroft was fullback in Gould's next 18 international games. Gould regained the captaincy for the next game, an encounter with England at Crown Flatt in Dewsbury, and from that point held the captaincy whenever he represented Wales. The encounter was an historic day for Wales, with the country's first win over England, a single try from Buller Stadden giving Wales the victory. The campaign ended in a disappointing away draw with Ireland, which saw the introduction of Tom Graham, a Newport forward who would become Gould's club captain during the 1891\u201392 \"invincible\" season."]}, {"page": "Penarth RFC", "response": ["*  Dickie Garrett (8 caps)"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team", "response": ["Wales: Jim Webb (Newport), George Thomas (Newport), Dickie Garrett (Penarth), Charlie Arthur (Cardiff), Norman Biggs (Cardiff), Charlie Thomas (Newport), William Stadden (Cardiff), Frank Hill (Cardiff) capt., Alexander Bland (Cardiff), Sydney Nicholls (Cardiff), Jim Hannan (Newport), Theo Harding (Newport), William Towers (Swansea), William Bowen (Swansea), Dan Griffiths, (Llanelli)"]}, {"page": "1865 in Wales", "response": ["**Dickie Garrett, rugby player (died 1908)"]}, {"page": "1889 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Hugh Hughes (Cardiff), Dickie Garrett (Penarth), James Webb (Newport), Edward Bishop (Swansea), Martyn Jordan (London Welsh), Charlie Thomas (Newport), Rosser Evans (Cardiff), Sydney Nicholls (Cardiff), Frank Hill (Cardiff) capt., William Williams (Cardiff), David William Evans (Cardiff), Theo Harding (Newport), Jim Hannan (Newport), Rowley Thomas (London Welsh), William Bowen (Swansea)"]}, {"page": "1890 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Charlie Thomas (Newport), Arthur Gould (Newport), Dickie Garrett (Penarth), Percy Lloyd (Llanelli), Evan James (Swansea), William Stadden (Cardiff), Frank Hill (Cardiff) capt., Alexander Bland (Cardiff), William Williams (Cardiff), William Bowen (Swansea), John Meredith (Swansea), Walter Rice Evans (Swansea), Jim Hannan (Newport), Stephen Thomas (Llanelli)", "Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Charlie Thomas (Newport), Arthur Gould (Newport) capt., Dickie Garrett (Penarth), Percy Lloyd (Llanelli), David Gwynn (Swansea), William Stadden (Cardiff), William Williams (Cardiff), David William Evans (Cardiff), William Bowen (Swansea), John Meredith (Swansea), Alexander Bland (Cardiff), Willie Thomas (London Welsh), Jim Hannan (Newport), Stephen Thomas (Llanelli)", "Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Charlie Thomas (Newport), Arthur Gould (Newport) capt., Dickie Garrett (Penarth), George Thomas (Newport), David Gwynn (Swansea), Hugh Ingledew (Cardiff), Frank Hill (Cardiff), David William Evans (Cardiff), William Bowen (Swansea), Alexander Bland (Cardiff), Willie Thomas (London Welsh), Jim Hannan (Newport), Tom Graham (Newport), Rowley Thomas (London Welsh)"]}, {"page": "1891 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), William McCutcheon (Swansea), Dickie Garrett (Penarth), David Gwynn (Swansea), George Thomas (Newport), Ralph Sweet-Escott (Cardiff), Hugh Ingledew (Cardiff), Percy Bennett (Cardiff Harlequins), Sydney Nicholls (Cardiff), Tom Graham (Newport), William Bowen (Swansea), Walter Rice Evans (Swansea), David Daniel (Llanelli), Rowley Thomas (London Welsh), Willie Thomas (Llanelli) capt.", "Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Tom Pearson (Cardiff), Dickie Garrett (Penarth), Charlie Thomas (Newport), Percy Lloyd (Llanelli), Evan James (Swansea), David James (Swansea), John Samuel (Swansea), Charles Nicholl (Llanelli), Tom Graham (Newport), Stephen Thomas (Llanelli), Tom Deacon (Swansea), David Samuel (Swansea), Rowley Thomas (London Welsh), Willie Thomas (Llanelli) capt."]}, {"page": "Garrett (name)", "response": ["*Dickie Garrett (1865\u20131908), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "1892 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Tom Pearson (Cardiff), William McCutcheon (Swansea), Arthur Gould (Newport) capt., Dickie Garrett (Penarth), Percy Phillips (Newport), George Rowles (Penarth), Frank Mills (Swansea), Charles Nicholl (Llanelli), Tom Graham (Newport), Jim Hannan (Newport), Tom Deacon (Swansea), Arthur Boucher (Newport), Rowley Thomas (London Welsh), Wallace Watts (Newport)"]}, {"page": "Richard Garrett", "response": ["*Dickie Garrett (1865\u20131908), Wales international rugby player"]}, {"page": "Charlie Arthur", "response": ["A week later Arthur was part of the Cardiff team to face the same touring M\u0101oris, who had come back from the Welsh defeat to beat both Swansea and Newport in the last five days.
