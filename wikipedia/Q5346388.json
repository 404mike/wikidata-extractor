He started working life as a lace draughtsman. As an artist he was known for his dramatic paintings of the British coastline, particularly around Yorkshire, Wales and Cornwall. He painted mainly in oils in a broad, impressionistic style. He also painted in watercolour. He exhibited extensively at the Royal Society of British Artists (elected member in 1875), the Royal Academy and many other galleries in London and other UK cities. A major retrospective exhibition of his work was held at the Nottingham Museum and Art Gallery in 1893. He declared himself bankrupt, was involved in two divorce proceedings and died in London of alcohol related problems. At one time he was married to the former wife of American painter George Henry Yewell.\nForty-seven of his oil paintings are held in UK public art collections.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Edwin Ellis (1842\u20131895)"]}, {"page": "Edwin Ellis", "response": ["Edwin Ellis may refer to:", "*Edwin Ellis (poet) (1848\u20131916), British poet and illustrator", "*Edwin Ellis (artist) (1842\u20131895), English artist", "*Edwin Ellis (musician) (1844\u20131878), English musician"]}, {"page": "George Henry Yewell", "response": ["After his period of study, Yewell returned to Iowa City and painted portraits, specializing in depictions of children. By January 1856 he was back in New York and reenrolled at the Academy; he took a studio in the city at this time as well. That July he went to Paris, again supported by Mason and his friends; until 1861 he studied there with Thomas Couture and counting among his acquaintances fellow students Henry A. Loop and Thomas Satterwhite Noble. A copy which he made of a painting by Rosa Bonheur during this time won him much acclaim from his fellow artists. In 1862 Yewell was in Iowa again, taking studio space in Des Moines, but by that spring he was back in New York, with a studio in the Dodsworth Building, when he submitted five works to the annual exhibition of the National Academy. At least three of the pieces in question were genre scenes dating to his French sojourn. Yewell never returned to Iowa to live, though he visited regularly, and married a local woman, Mary Elizabeth (Mollie) Coast, in 1863. With his wife and her brother Oscar he returned to Europe in 1867, and took up residence in Rome; he spent summers in Perugia and Venice and traveled to Egypt in 1875, and returned to the United States in 1878. Among his friends in Rome were Elihu Vedder, Charles C. Coleman, and Bayard Taylor. It is suspected that Yewell returned to the United States due to the behavior of his wife, who had shocked the American expatriate community in Rome; the couple were divorced the next year, and she married the English painter Edwin Ellis."]}]}}
