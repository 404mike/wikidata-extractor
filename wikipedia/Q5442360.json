Their representative in England, a Mr Mallam, had tried to interest Charles Dickens in a lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand but without success. Instead, having noted the success of the 1859 venture, and the growing popularity of cricket in Australia, Spiers and Pond decided to attract a team of leading English cricketers. Mallam therefore journeyed to Birmingham in September 1861 to watch the North v. South game at Aston Park."]}, {"page": "Christopher Pond", "response": ["Christopher Pond was born in Essex in 1826.
