Thus, in 1982, they fell into the Fourth Division, and were declared bankrupt. A new club was formed and BCFC (1982) Ltd acquired the club's player contracts. The highly paid senior players Julian Marshall, Chris Garland, Jimmy Mann, Peter Aitken, Geoff Merrick, David Rodgers, Gerry Sweeney and Trevor Tainton, who became known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight', each accepted termination of his contract for half the amount due. The club's previous owners had failed to pay its debts to many local businesses. The resulting ill will towards the club made it difficult for the new owners to obtain credit."]}, {"page": "Trowbridge Town F.C.", "response": ["*Peter Aitken"]}, {"page": "Chris Garland", "response": ["He rarely featured under Houghton, and when new manager Roy Hodgson arrived he informed Garland and seven teammates (Julian Marshall, Jimmy Mann, Geoff Merrick, Peter Aitken, David Rodgers, Trevor Tainton and Gerry Sweeney), known as the \"Ashton Gate Eight\", that would have to take voluntary redundancy as part of a last-ditch plan to save the club, which was on the verge of folding; Garland agreed and lost \u00a33,750. He and Merrick then spent six months playing in Hong Kong for Caroline Hill. City suffered a third successive relegation in 1981\u201382 after dropping out of the Third Division.

Randall's love of punk music earned him the nickname \"Punky\" amongst his Rovers teammates. After his first training session he was informed by manager Don Megson that he would be playing in a friendly against Trowbridge Town. Rover won 6\u20130 with Randall scoring four goals and he earned a place in the starting line up for the season opener against Cardiff City. Randall scored in a closely contested 1\u20131 draw instantly becoming a fan favourite. He scored again in his home debut against Notts County but Rovers threw away a 2\u20130 lead to draw 2\u20132. After pulling his hamstring in the next match against Fulham Randall was rested for the trip to Blackpool which Rovers lost 3\u20131. He returned to the side which lost 2\u20131 back to back against Luton Town and Leyton Orient although Randall did scored both of Rovers' goals. He was rested again by Megson as they won their first game of the season against Mansfield Town on 4 October 1978. However, despite naming an unchanged side Rovers lost 3\u20131 to Burnley which prompted the arrival of Bobby Gould who scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on his debut. Randall still suffering with injury missed the match against Tottenham Hotspur which infamously ended in a 9\u20130 defeat. Results failed to improve and after the team crashed to a 5\u20131 loss at Sunderland Megson decided to leave for Portland Timbers."]}, {"page": "List of people named Peter", "response": ["* Peter Aitken (born 1954), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Aitken, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Aitken"]}]}}
