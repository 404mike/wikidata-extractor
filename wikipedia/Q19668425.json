Originally, Greg Dyke had planned to use LWT as a springboard to start acquiring companies to build a united ITV. On 6 December 1993, the north-west England franchise-holder Granada Television launched a hostile takeover for the company, worth \u00a3600\u00a0million. The takeover bid came about owing to the relaxation of the rules governing the ITV network. LWT tried to outstep the takeover bid with talks being held with Yorkshire Television and Scottish Television.Martin Waller, \"Granada set to launch bid for LWT\", The Times, 6 December 1993, p.36 A week later a conflict of words had broken out between LWT and Granada, with Granada claiming the YTV-LWT deal was \"Something cobbled together by desperate men\". Gerry Robinson, the Chairman of Granada plc, was also surprised if LWT went ahead with a bid for YTV, especially since it had made \u00a310\u00a0million losses that week and was already paying much of its revenue to the government. Reports also suggested if LWT bid for Yorkshire Television it would also form an alliance with Anglia who would takeover Tyne Tees Television.Carl Mostished \"Granada hits out at LWT triple alliance\", The Times, 13 December 1993, p.36 By New Year's Eve, Granada had increased its bid to \u00a3658\u00a0million.Martin Waller, \"Granada extends LWT bid\", The Times, 30 December 1993, p.23", "By 7 January 1994, the merger talks between Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television had collapsed because it had proved impossible to reach an agreement on a suitable structure for the new company. A few days earlier Anglia had withdrawn from the proposed alliance, making an LWT takeover of YTV impossible.Susan Gilchrist, \"Collapse of merger talks puts LWT under pressure\", The Times, 7 January 1994, p.23 By 7 February 1994, Granada had increase its takeover bid again to \u00a3774\u00a0million, but the LWT board once again rejected the offer. Granada's Chief Executive, Gerry Robinson, said: \"We are obviously disappointed that having evidently accepted the commercial argument in favour of scale, the board of LWT has not been able to recommend what is a generous offer.\" Sir Christopher Bland rejected this statement, claiming \"the Granada offer is inadequate and still fails to reflect the true value of LWT\".Martin Waller, \"LWT rejects Granada's final bid after talks fail\", The Times, 9 February 1994, p.27 On Friday 25 February 1994, LWT had succumbed to Granada's \u00a3770 million bid for the company. This resulted in Greg Dyke and Sir Christopher Bland leaving LWT.Martin Waller, \"LWT succumbs to \u00a3770 million Granada takeover bid\", The Times 26 February 1994, p.21"]}, {"page": "Kitty Ussher", "response": ["On 5 October 2008, she moved to become Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions, taking on broad welfare reform responsibilities previously undertaken by Stephen Timms and James Plaskitt.
