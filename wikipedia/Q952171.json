The young Rogers was weaned on his uncle's jazz collection and 1950s rock and roll. Before MMEB he was a member of The Vision, which backed Adam Faith, and the Australian bands The Playboys, Bulldog, and Procession.He left the Earth Band because he wanted to steer the band more in the direction of Frank Zappa, which created friction with Mann.\nI had an offer to [play with] Zappa and got to know him fairly well and played with him. I became too much for the band and, I think, I had to go. It was like I was being destructive in as much that I wanted to play other things, you know? It was probably a midlife muso crisis. I worked through that. Earlier in my career I had lived in Australia and I went back through there, hooked up with some friends of mine, who are fusion players. We used to do some crazy stuff, like Ornette Coleman stuff. One moment we would be playing Ornette Coleman and the next I would be doing something from the 1950s. I'd be doing a couple of Elvis things. Even with the Earth Band, now, I do 'Shake, Rattle and Roll' on my own. I went to Los Angeles for a while, too, and got the muso stuff out of my system and rejoined the Earth Band in 1986 and I've been there since.\nAfter his initial departure from MMEB in 1975, he returned to Australia to work and then returned to the UK, where he formed the band Aviator with drummer Clive Bunker. They released two albums.\nDuring his second tenure with the Earth Band (that continues to this day), Rogers released a handful of solo albums. His solo debut Back to Earth got a mixed review on the German Babyblaue Prog-Reviews, which praised Rogers' vocal and guitar work but criticized the fact that he was not accompanied by other musicians and instead relied on programmed drums. Father of Day was described on the same site as a maxi single, which shared its parent album's qualities and shortcomings.Sharabang, recorded in the Austrian Alps, featured Matt & Gregg Bissonette and was mixed by Chuck Ainlay. The album got a positive review from RockTimes, praising authentic and solid work and giving a lot of attention to Rogers' own compositions such as \"Cutting Me to Pieces\". A similarly positive review was published by Musik an sich, giving the album 15 out of 20 stars. Reviewer J\u00fcrgen Weber lauded Rogers' rendition of \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and also pointed out \"Cutting Me to Pieces\" as a highlight, but noted that the album could have done with more original songs and more uptempo material.Musicreviews.de was more reserved in its review, again praising the Rammstein-esque \"Cutting Me to Pieces\" as well as Rogers's vocals, but criticizing some soft songs in the second half and the too obvious choice of covers. According to Rogers himself, he would've preferred to cover obscure songs from the 1950s and tracks by Ornette Coleman, but his label preferred more accessible song choices such as \"The Joker\". He also later denounced his non-album Christmas release from 2012, a cover of the John Lennon / Yoko Ono song Happy Xmas (War Is Over), saying he was sponsored to do it, but wouldn't do it again because it wasn't his style.During the initial years with Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Mick Rogers was the only guitarist and chief lead vocalist in the group. When he returned in 1984, he shared vocal and guitar duties with Chris Thompson until Thompson's exit. The band effectively stopped existing after the release of Masque in 1987 but a new formation was formed in the early 1990s. Chris Thompson's parts and several new songs were now sung by Noel McCalla, whereas Rogers mostly only sang lead on \"Father of Day, Father of Night\", \"Joybringer\" and some verses on \"Spirits in the Night\" and \"Mighty Quinn\". This pattern did not change through further line-ups; Rogers is once again the band's main guitarist (current vocalist Robert Hart intermittently plays guitar) but never sings more than a handful of vocal parts, which in recent times have typically included a stripped-down version of \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\".\nIn 2020, Rogers planned to play material of the early Earth Band with original member Colin Pattenden and keyboardist Mike Keneally at the Burg Herzberg Festival under the moniker \"Solar Fire\", however this didn't happen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The appearance was rescheduled twice and is now planned for 2022.Mick Rogers lives in Surrey and has three kids. In a 2019 interview, he explained his opposition to Brexit (\"Make that a headline: Mick Rogers does not want out of the EU\").", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manfred Mann's Earth Band", "response": ["The original line-up consisted of Mick Rogers (guitar and vocals), Manfred Mann (keyboards, Minimoog synthesizer and vocals), Colin Pattenden (bass guitar) and Chris Slade (drums and vocals). In its very earliest stages, the band was sometimes billed as \"Manfred Mann\" and thus a continuation of the 1960s group, sometimes as \"Manfred Mann Chapter Three\" due to that being the most recent incarnation of Mann's career. The quartet released their first single, Bob Dylan's \"Please, Mrs. Henry\", in 1971, simply credited to \"Manfred Mann\". A debut album \"Stepping Sideways\" was recorded but not released because the band's style was rapidly maturing, and the group felt it wasn't representative of their live act anymore. In September 1971, a new name was chosen. Manfred Mann suggested a title containing \"band\" (which almost rhymes with \"Mann\") and after considering the likes of \"Arm Band\", \"Head Band\" and \"Elastic Band\", Chris Slade suggested \"Earth Band\", a name both related to the band's originally straightforward musical style and the ecological movement ongoing at the time.Greg Russo, Mannerisms \u2013 The five phases of Manfred Mann (Revised Edition), Crossfire Publications, 2011, , p.121", "The group's sixth album, 1975's Nightingales & Bombers, took its title from a World War II naturalist's recording of a nightingale singing in a garden as warplanes flew overhead; the recording appears in a track on the album (the US version included an extra track, a cover of Bob Dylan's; \"Quit Your Low Down Ways\" sung by Mick Rogers). After this album, Mick Rogers left the band (temporarily, and he still contributed backing vocals to the next album). He was replaced by two musicians, Chris Thompson (lead vocals, guitar) and Dave Flett (lead guitar, backing vocals).", "The Roaring Silence also featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist Barbara Thompson. Taking advantage of the publicity of their hit song, the band re-released another Springsteen song, \"Spirit in the Night\", re-titled \"Spirits in the Night\", which the band had released the previous year on Nightingales & Bombers, in a vocally re-cut version with Chris Thompson taking a new lead vocal in place of Mick Rogers' vocal on the original album version.", "1980's Chance, featuring several guest vocalists alongside Thompson, Mann and Waller, showed a move towards a more electronic approach and produced several cuts that were hits in the UK and/or saw significant airplay in both the US and UK, with the songs \"Lies (All Through the 80's)\" sung by Thompson, \"Stranded\" and \"For You\" (another Springsteen song sung by Thompson). Trevor Rabin, a fellow South African and London session musician, and lead guitarist of the 1980s version of Yes, guested on the album, as did original Earth Band guitarist Mick Rogers. Bassist Pat King left the group in 1982 to be replaced by bassist/guitarist Matt Irving.", "The accompanying tour (incorporating visual effects such as cartoons, robots and exploding amplifiers) was a big success and led to the Budapest live album, which was later followed by a DVD of the TV broadcast. After this tour, Steve Waller left the band. Mick Rogers returned, taking Waller's place.", "In 1984 the band issued the single \"Runner\", a cover of the song by Ian Thomas, which had been written in response to cancer sufferer Terry Fox and his run across Canada for cancer awareness. Fox had succumbed to the cancer before finishing. The Manfred Mann version featured Chris Thompson on lead vocals and Mick Rogers on backing vocals.  The song was a non-LP single in the UK but was included on the US release of Somewhere in Afrika. It was a top 40 hit in both Canada and the US and was used during ABC's broadcasting of the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the film The Philadelphia Experiment. At 22 on the Hot 100 it was their biggest hit since \"Blinded by the Light\" and was the band's second highest-charting song, as well as their final US/UK chart single.", "Irving exited the group shortly after the single. Steve Kinch played bass on this album Criminal Tango (1986), which featured both Mick Rogers and Chris Thompson on vocals. For 1987's Masque album, the band consisted solely of Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers and drummer John Lingwood. Shortly thereafter, the Earth Band name was retired for four years.", "Manfred Mann's Earth Band was revived in 1991 with a lineup of Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers, Steve Kinch, singer Noel McCalla and former Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker and resumed recording, covering tracks by artists as varied as Paul Weller, Robert Cray, Del Amitri and The Lovin' Spoonful. Mann has also released solo projects, including Plains Music, which was based on Native American music, and 2006, which includes collaborations with the German rapper Thomas D and tracks featuring the music of, amongst others, the Super Furry Animals.", "The Earth Band has had a fluctuating line-up, with Mann being the only continuous member. After drummer Clive Bunker left in 1996, he was succeeded by John Trotter (1996-2000), Richard Marcangelo (2000\u20132002), Pete May (2002), Geoff Dunn (2002\u20132007), Jimmy Copley (2007\u20132015) and then a returning John Lingwood in 2016. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Thompson returned in 1996 to sing alongside Mick Rogers and Noel McCalla until 1999 (then again in 2004, briefly). McCalla was replaced by Peter Cox in 2009, but returned in 2010 for a short time filling in for Cox. Since Cox departed in early 2011, Robert Hart (ex-Bad Company) has been the singer, along with Mick Rogers.", "ManfredMannsEarthBand1.JPG|Singer and guitar player Mick Rogers (2010)", "ManfredMannsEarhBand4.jpg|Mick Rogers (left), Peter Cox (middle) and Steve Kinch (right)", "*Mick Rogers \u2013 guitar and vocals (1971\u20131975, 1983\u2013present)", " bar:MicRog   text:Mick Rogers"]}, {"page": "Messin'", "response": ["# \"Buddah\" (Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers \u2013 7:01", "#\"Buddah\" (Mann, Mick Rogers) \u2013 7:00", "* Mick Rogers \u2013 Electric guitar, lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Masque (Manfred Mann's Earth Band album)", "response": ["#\"Joybringer (from 'Jupiter')\" (Gustav Holst, Mann, Mick Rogers, Chris Slade)", "#\"Joybringer (from Jupiter)\" (Gustav Holst, Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers, Chris Slade) \u2013 2:28  ", "* Mick Rogers \u2013 guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "2006 (album)", "response": ["*Mick Rogers\u00a0\u2013 guitars"]}, {"page": "Mann Alive", "response": ["# \"It's A Fine Line\" (Manfred Mann, Steve Kinch, John Trotter, Mick Rogers) \u2013 1:32", "* Mick Rogers - guitars,  vocals"]}, {"page": "The Best of Manfred Mann's Earth Band Re-Mastered Volume II", "response": ["#\"Time Is Right\" (6:32)  (Manfred Mann, Chris Slade, Mick Rogers) \u2013 6:32"]}, {"page": "The Best of Manfred Mann's Earth Band Re-Mastered", "response": ["#\"Joybringer\" (single version) (Gustav Holst, Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers, Chris Slade) \u2013 3:24"]}, {"page": "Soft Vengeance", "response": ["*Mick Rogers - guitars"]}, {"page": "Criminal Tango", "response": ["Criminal Tango is an album released in 1986 by Manfred Mann's Earth Band with Chris Thompson.
