Two of his works survive in the Old Hall Manuscript, one a Gloria (no. 8), the other a Sarum Agnus Dei discant (no. 3, Old Hall, no. 128), later scratched out, which is ascribed to W. Aleyn. If this inscription is correct, the conflation of this composer and Johannes Alanus, who wrote Sub Arturo Plebs, is incorrect. David Fallows ascribed this Agnus to W. Typp, however it seems that he was mistaken.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of one-word stage names", "response": ["* Aleyn, English composer"]}, {"page": "List of medieval composers", "response": ["| style=\"background-color: #EAECF0\"| Aleyn "]}, {"page": "W.

For the composer represented in the Old Hall Manuscript, who has sometimes been conflated with Johannes Alanus, see Aleyn. The composer of Sub Arturo plebs, is identified as Jo.Alani and referring to J.Alani Minimus. He has been identified with Dominus Johannes Aleyn (or John Aleyn), who was a chaplain for the chapel of Edward III of England and later Canon of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle from 1362 until his death in 1373. He received many other favors which indicate royal patronage, probably from Queen Philippa of Hainault.", "Sub Arturo plebs/Fons citharizancium/In omnem terram is an ars nova mensuration motet with a different text in each voice. The \"triplum\", or third voice, is on a text which names 14 musicians. These mentions, in some cases, are the sole extant references to these active musicians. Brian Trowell has identified many of those named with royal households. There has been significant debate as to the dating of this motet. The earliest dating assumes that it was written for the 1349 founding of the Order of the Garter, this date suggested by Trowell. Roger Bowers suggests that the list of musicians includes musicians who were no longer active at the time of the writing. Margaret Bent and others argue for a later date because of the style of the music itself, which includes a complex structure with three levels of diminution and rhythmic overlapping. This later dating, however, does not fall in with the theory that the composer is the same as the chaplain Johannes Aleyn. A certain date earlier than 1370 for this work would lead to a change in accepted ideas about the mid-14th-century style."]}]}}
