He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Windsor in 1850. He was a Commissioner of the Insolvent Debtors Court and a Commissioner for National Education.As a politician he was praised for his \"zealous advocacy of civil and religious liberty\" and his commitment to entrenchment and economy in every department of state. Rather surprisingly, he never became a judge. He married Elizabeth Waddy, daughter of Richard Waddy  of Clougheast Castle, County Wexford, a member of a prominent local  family,  who were descended from  Cromwellian  settlers, and his wife Penelope Hatchell, daughter of Nicholas Hatchell.
