Eight of these players have won the award for at least a second time, the most recent being Sean Newton. Newton and Daniel Parslow are the only players to have received the award on three occasions. Gordon Staniforth was the first to win the trophy in consecutive seasons, a feat since emulated by John MacPhail, Barry Jones and Alan Fettis. Three winners of the award have represented their country at senior international level, of whom Jon McCarthy and Alan Fettis went on to become Clubman of the Year for a second time. Chris Brass, the winner of the 2003 award, went on to manage the club from 2003 to 2004. The current incumbent of the award is Sean Newton, who was the 2018\u201319 recipient."]}]}}
