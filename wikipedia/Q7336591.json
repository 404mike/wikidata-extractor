The film had its first public screening on 31 October 2009, at the London FrightFest Film Festival, and in 2010 was picked up by Lionsgate for 2011 and 2012 DVD distribution.", "Jacob (Doug Bradley) is an antiques dealer who sets off with his new young and pregnant wife Lauren (Grace Vallorani) and his stepdaughter, Rachel (Rita Ramnani) to a forest homestead in a hopeful effort to heal bonds between feuding family members. He also carries a large, mysterious and ancient Babylonian mirror, smuggled out of the Middle East, which he plans to sell for profit.  Lilith (Natalie Celino), a sultry ornithologist appeares out of a bird hide by a noisy pair of friends hiking through the woods.  Gaining their confidence, she and one of the men, Travis (Scott North) go into the woods for a quick tryst, but immediately there is a blood curdling scream. The other camper, Stanley (James Fisher), rushes toward the sound and finds his friend mutilated and near dead. Near Travis, Lilith explains to Stanley that the shadows had come to life and attacked them, and the two set off to seek help. When they end up at Jacob's cabin, the entire group comes under attack by supernatural forces of darkness. Rachel discovers Irish cowboy Phelan (Jonnie Hurn) hanging out in their barn.  Phelan is a vampire and himself a former vampire hunter.  He tells Rachel that the real danger to everyone is Lilith, and explains how Lilith had been Adam's willful first wife who, since having been exiled from the Garden of Eden, had been spawning demonic offspring in the world of man. Considered the mother to the Succubi, ruler of shadows, slaughterer of children, and consort to the devil himself, she had been re-awakened by, and drawn to the location of, the occult power inherent in the mirror carried by Jacob. Phelan has been harboring a centuries-long grudge against her for she having \"turned\" him 120 years earlier, and he had been tracking her for decades, equipped with the one relic that might finally kill her... a bone splinter from the rib of Adam himself.", "Dread Central described the film, Drew Cullingham's first directorial effort, as \"ambitious\", and that the film was an \"eclectic mix of family melodrama, vampire action, supernatural horror and Western styling\". The review stated that these diverse elements were its downfall, \"leaving a wildly inconsistent yet occasionally promising piece of work,\"  that it was not lacking in well-conceived individual elements, and the backgrounds of the characters are decently explored.  But the major problem was in the director's inability to deliver on the potential of those elements, with his efforts \"cack-handed at best, and laughable at worst.\"  The reviewer appreciated his \"eye for cinema\" and his ability to make the film look like it cost more to produce than one might have expected from its small budget. Further, the cast \"for the most part\" performed admirably; Bradley \"seems to be having a lot of fun in a 'normal' role\" as opposed to his usual genre fare, and carried his character of a family man with aplomb.  His co-star Rita Ramnani was \"effectively annoying and self-centered as Rachel\", but was let down by the screenplay, not by any failing on her part. The review considered Jonnie Hurn's Phelan to be \"the most interesting character here, both on page and screen,\" and a well-nuanced and suitably impressive anti-hero.  Natalie Celino as Lilith was faulted for her \"constantly off-kilter, disinterested line delivery and a Scottish accent so thick it proves almost impenetrable.\""]}, {"page": "How to Stop Being a Loser", "response": ["* Rita Ramnani as Jenny"]}, {"page": "Airborne (2012 film)", "response": ["* Rita Ramnani as Claire"]}, {"page": "Strippers vs Werewolves", "response": ["*Rita Ramnani as Chastity"]}, {"page": "The Rise and Fall of a White Collar Hooligan", "response": ["The Rise and Fall of a White Collar Hooligan is a 2012 British crime film directed by Paul Tanter and starring Nick Nevern, Simon Phillips, Rita Ramnani, and Billy Murray.", "An unemployed football fanatic named Mike Jacobs (played by Nick Nevern) becomes a major credit card fraudster and gangster.
