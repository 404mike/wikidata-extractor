Elgar said, \"my first music was learnt in the Cathedral\u00a0... from books borrowed from the music library, when I was eight, nine or ten.\"Quoted by Kennedy (ODNB) He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on the theory of music. He later said that he had been most helped by Hubert Parry's articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.Reed, p. 11 Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the Leipzig Conservatory for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later, a profile in The Musical Times considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: \"Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools.\" However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader. Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.Moore (1984), pp. 57 and 67"]}, {"page": "1900 in music", "response": ["*November 14 \u2013 Adolf Pollitzer, violinist, 68"]}, {"page": "Harold Bauer", "response": ["Harold Bauer was born in Kingston upon Thames; his father was a German violinist and his mother was English.

In 1892, however, he went to Paris and studied the piano under Ignacy Jan Paderewski for a year, though still maintaining his interest in the violin. An anecdote reports that Paderewski jokingly told Bauer to concentrate on the piano because \"You have such beautiful hair\".
