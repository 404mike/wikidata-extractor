At the same time United Artists approached actors Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by a British actor and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover (who would portray Aristotle Kristatos in For Your Eyes Only), John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. Broccoli  met with Anthony Hopkins about playing the role, but Hopkins did not think that he was right for the part. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond, but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately chosen for the role. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained on the top of the list in the event that Moore declined to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedic scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond."]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* John Ronane"]}, {"page": "For Whom the Bell Tolls (TV series)", "response": ["For Whom the Bell Tolls is a British television series first aired by BBC  in 1965, based on the 1940 novel by Ernest Hemingway.
