Stross specialises in hard science fiction and space opera. Between 1994 and 2004, he was also an active writer for the magazine Computer Shopper and was responsible for the monthly Linux column. He stopped writing for the magazine to devote more time to novels. However, he continues to publish freelance articles on the Internet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bastard Operator From Hell", "response": ["The protagonist in Charles Stross's The Laundry Files series of novels named himself Bob Oliver Francis Howard in reference to the BOFH. As Bob Howard is a self-chosen pseudonym, and Bob is a network manager when not working as a computational demonologist, the name is all too appropriate. In the novella Pimpf, he acquires a pimply-faced young assistant by the name of Peter-Fred Young."]}, {"page": "Dyson sphere", "response": ["Theoretically, any gas giant could be enclosed in a solid shell; at a certain radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy could be provided by tapping the thermal energy of the planet. This concept is explored peripherally in the novel Accelerando (and the short story Curator, which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by Charles Stross, in which Saturn is converted into a human-habitable world."]}, {"page": "Iain Banks", "response": ["Banks's publisher called him \"an irreplaceable part of the literary world\". This was reaffirmed by a fellow Scottish author and friend since secondary school Ken MacLeod: his death \"left a large gap in the Scottish literary scene as well as the wider English-speaking world.\" British author Charles Stross wrote, \"One of the giants of 20th and 21st century Scottish literature has left the building.\" Authors, including Neil Gaiman, Ian Rankin, Alastair Reynolds and David Brin also paid tribute in blogs and elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Ken MacLeod", "response": ["He is part of a group of British science fiction writers who specialise in hard science fiction and space opera. His contemporaries include Neal Asher, Stephen Baxter, Iain M. Banks, Paul J. McAuley, Alastair Reynolds, Adam Roberts, Charles Stross, Richard Morgan, and Liz Williams.", "He is known for his constant in-joking and punning on the intersection between socialist ideologies and computer programming, as well as other fields. For example, his chapter titles such as \"Trusted Third Parties\" or \"Revolutionary Platform\" usually have double (or multiple) meanings. A future programmers union is called \"Information Workers of the World Wide Web\", or the Webblies, a reference to the Industrial Workers of the World, who are nicknamed the Wobblies. The Webblies idea formed a central part of the novel For the Win by Cory Doctorow and MacLeod is acknowledged as coining the term. MacLeod is thanked in the Acknowledgements section: \"Many thanks to Ken MacLeod for letting me use IWWWW and 'Webbly.'\" Doctorow and Charles Stross also used one of MacLeod's references to the singularity as \"the rapture for nerds\" as the title for their collaborative novel Rapture of the Nerds (although MacLeod denies coining the phrase). There are also many references to, or puns on, zoology and palaeontology. For example, in The Stone Canal  the title of the book, and many places described in it, are named after anatomical features of marine invertebrates such as starfish."]}, {"page": "October 18", "response": ["*  1964   \u2013 Charles Stross, English journalist, author, and programmer"]}, {"page": "Robert A.

Gregory Benford refers to his novel Jupiter Project as a Heinlein tribute. Similarly, Charles Stross says his Hugo Award-nominated novel Saturn's Children is \"a space opera and late-period Robert A. Heinlein tribute\", referring to Heinlein's Friday.

He makes two appearances in Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The first is in the story Allan and the Sundered Veil, which appears in the end of volume one. In this story, Moore claims that H. P. Lovecraft's Randolph Carter is a descendant of John Carter. Carter also appears in the beginning of volume two, helping the Barsoomians fight against the Martians from The War of the Worlds. The same scenario also appeared in the Burroughs entry in the War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches anthology. In addition, one of the protagonists of Robert A. Heinlein's The Number of the Beast is Captain Zebediah John Carter, whose lover becomes his wife Dejah Thoris \"Deety\" Burroughs Carter. The similarity in names is noted within the novel, since all of the major characters are fans of vintage science fiction. In Saturn's Children, by Charles Stross, Barsoom and Carter City are names of settlements on Mars.  In Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's \"World of Tiers\" novels the moon circling the World of Tiers is modelled after Barsoom, from Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels, an homage which Farmer openly admits in the third book of the series. In Dan Simmon's Hyperion, when Fedmahn Kassad turned eighteen, he was offered the choice of serving at a Martian polar work camp or enlisting with the John Carter Brigade, a volunteer task force seeking to aid FORCE against the Glennon-Height Rebellion.  In Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory series final novel, Settling Accounts: In at the Death, a character named John Carter of the \"Tarkas\" estate (a reference to Tars Tarkas, one of the green men of Mars), appears before a U.S. general after having protected African-Americans from the genocide taking place elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Serdar Argic", "response": ["Ken MacLeod referred to Argic in his novel The Star Fraction as a slang term for \"the lowest layer of paranoid drivel that infested the Cable, spun out by degenerate, bug-ridden, knee-jerk auto-post programs.
