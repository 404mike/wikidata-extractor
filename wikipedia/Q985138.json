He spent much of his life as a tramp or hobo in the United Kingdom and the United States, yet became one of the most popular poets of his time. His themes included observations on life's hardships, the ways the human condition is reflected in nature, his tramping adventures, and the characters he met. Davies is usually classed as a Georgian Poet, though much of his work is not typical of the group in style or theme.", "link_mentions": {}}}
