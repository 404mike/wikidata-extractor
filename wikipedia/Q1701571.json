He is best known for his work on the James Bond film series (at least Casino Royale, Moonraker, Octopussy, A View to a Kill and Die Another Day), all the Harry Potter film series (2001-2011), A Bridge Too Far (1977) and Aliens (1986). For the latter, he won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 1987 ceremony. He won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects for his work on the film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 (2011), for which he was also nominated for an Academy Award at the 2012 ceremony.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Visual Effects", "response": ["|Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson and Suzanne M.

Miniatures and optical effects were created by L.A. Effects Group. Cameron avoided using bigger special effects studios because he lacked contacts with them and believed his hands-on approach would not be welcomed. He avoided hiring too many Alien crew members because he did not want to be restricted by loyalties to the first film. Some crew did return, often with a higher status (such as Crispian Sallis, Alien focus puller and Aliens set decorator). Cameron had enjoyed returning artist Ron Cobb's work on Alien. Conceptual artist Syd Mead was recruited, since the director was a fan of his work on films such as 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984).", "John Richardson designed the mechanical power loader exosuit, with input from Mead. Like the queen, a prototype was built out of wood and polythene bags stuffed with newspaper to see how the movement would work. The finished design was so cumbersome that stuntman John Lees, in a black skinsuit, operated it from behind. The battle between the queen and power loader was choreographed extensively, as Weaver risked serious injury battling a large, unwieldy animatronic. The camera was sometimes moved around to simulate subjects moving faster. The scene of the queen running at Ripley was one of the more difficult shots; the wires and rods had to be concealed, since they could not be removed in post-production. Miniatures were used for parts of the scene with go motion, a version of stop motion with motion blur added.", "Aliens received two awards at the 1987 Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing (Don Sharpe) and Best Visual Effects (Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson, Suzanne Benson). Weaver was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Marlee Matlin for the romantic drama Children of a Lesser God. Weaver's was the first Best Actress nomination for a science-fiction film, when the genre was given little respect. The film received four other nominations: Best Original Score for Horner (losing to Herbie Hancock for the musical drama Round Midnight); Best Art Director for Peter Lamont and Crispian Sallis (losing to Gianni Quaranta, Brian Ackland-Snow, Brian Savegar and Elio Altamura for the romance, A Room with a View); Best Editing for Ray Lovejoy (losing to Claire Simpson for Platoon), and Best Sound for Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier, Michael A. Carter, and Roy Charman (losing to John K. Wilkinson, Richard Rogers, Charles Grenzbach and Simon Kaye for Platoon). Weaver's nomination remains a rarity in the action or science-fiction genres. At the 44th Golden Globe Awards, she was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama (again losing to Matlin for Children of a Lesser God)."]}, {"page": "Saturn Award for Best Special Effects", "response": ["| John Evans, John Richardson", "| John Richardson (Industrial Light & Magic)", "| Robert Legato, Nick Davis, Roger Guyett, John Richardson", "| Jim Mitchell, Nick Davis, John Richardson, Bill George", "| Roger Guyett, Tim Burke, Bill George, John Richardson", "| Jim Mitchell, Tim Alexander, Timothy Webber, John Richardson", "| Tim Burke, John Richardson, Paul J.
