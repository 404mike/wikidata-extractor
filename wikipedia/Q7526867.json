He had an eventful early life, being shipwrecked early in his career and later captured by the French. Nevertheless, he saw enough service to attract the attention of powerful patrons that secured his rise through the ranks. An officer of considerable ability, he won a noteworthy victory against a stronger French opponent, before embarking on a period of distinguished service off the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, working closely with the British generals fighting the Peninsular War, and markedly contributing to their success. His good service led to a prime posting in command of a squadron despatched to hunt down and neutralise the American super frigates during the War of 1812. He came close to capturing the USS Constitution, but lost her in circumstances that were unclear and would later return to haunt him. The years of peace that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars saw him rewarded with a baronetcy, and he continued to serve in the navy where he was tasked with the suppression of the slave trade. The publishing of William James's account of the War of 1812, which lambasted him for incompetence and cowardice in his failure to catch the Constitution, broke his personal peace. Having failed to clear his name, and increasingly depressed by the accusations, Collier took his own life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Collier baronets", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Collier, 1st Baronet "]}, {"page": "George Ralph Collier", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Collier, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir George Ralph Collier", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Collier, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir George Ralph Collier, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Collier, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "George Collier, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Collier, 1st Baronet"]}]}}
