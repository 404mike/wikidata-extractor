In its early years, it was notable for the ministries of two leading evangelicals: Andrew Mitchell Thomson and Robert Smith Candlish.

Thomson also established a strong musical tradition at St George's: this continued with prominent choirmasters and organists, including Alexander Mackenzie. By the early 1960s, severe structural damage in the church building had become apparent and, in 1964, the congregation united with that of St Andrew's on George Street to form St Andrew's and St George's.
