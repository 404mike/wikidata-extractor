He began his footballing career when he joined Birmingham City on leaving school in 1979. A year later he made his first-team debut as a midfielder and by 1982 was a regular player in Birmingham's First Division side. By the turn of 1984, he had lost his place in the first team and was transferred to Walsall (in the Third Division) in hope of getting more first-team chances. He was a regular player for Walsall and within two years of joining, he returned to Birmingham.\nIn the autumn of 1986, Handysides was loaned out to Wolverhampton Wanderers and scored twice in 11 Fourth Division fixtures. On his return to Birmingham, he quickly re-established himself as a first-team regular and made 30 appearances in the 1987-88 Second Division campaign, scoring three goals, as he helped the club avoid relegation.\nIn the autumn of 1988, Handysides was diagnosed with a brain tumour. After a course of chemotherapy, he appeared to be recovering well, however this then spread to his spine and he died in Solihull on 17 August 1990, when still only 27 years old.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Ian Handysides \u2013 Footballer"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 in English football", "response": ["17 August 1990 \u2013 Ian Handysides, 27, former Birmingham City, Walsall and Wolves forward, died of cancer after a two-year battle against the illness."]}, {"page": "Giuliano Maiorana", "response": ["After around 30 games for Histon's first team, and having previously been turned down by Cambridge United, Brentford and Norwich City, he was invited for a trial for Manchester United in November 1988.
