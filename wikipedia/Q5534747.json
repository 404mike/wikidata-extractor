By the time he had left school, both his parents had died. While living with his uncle he reluctantly trained as an engineer at a colliery. It was at the colliery that he first became interested in acting when he organised concerts for the workforce, and won a scholarship to train at RADA while still working there. \nIn 1938, he married Judith Cope. Working in repertory theatre, his theatrical career was interrupted by World War II during which he served in Burma. Returning to the theatre after the war, he became a playwright and appeared on various TV shows and films. In 1947, he married Helen A. Syme at Cuckfield in Sussex.On Broadway he appeared as Sir Francis Getliffe in The Affair at the Henry Miller Theatre (1962) and as Major Hugh Beresford Maitland in Hostile Witness at the Music Box Theatre (1966). He wrote and starred in the 1958 farce Caught Napping in the West End. It was later revived in 1978 starring Arthur Lowe, Bill Pertwee and Edward Evans.\nHis best known role was as Captain Square in Dad's Army, the pompous commander of the Eastgate platoon of the Home Guard, who is a rival of Captain Mainwaring.  Other TV appearances included Rookery Nook, Upstairs, Downstairs, It Ain't Half Hot Mum and Edward & Mrs. Simpson.\nLumsden died in London in 1984, aged 69.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1959 in literature", "response": ["*Geoffrey Lumsden \u2013 Caught Napping"]}, {"page": "Ace of Wands (TV series)", "response": ["4 episodes.

He was later promoted to captain and placed in command of the Eastgate platoon, which is first revealed in \"Don't Forget the Diver\". Square had a serious military record, fighting in the desert with Lawrence of Arabia and winning several medals, including the DSO. In \"A Brush with the Law\", it is revealed that he is a magistrate. Square was even more pompous than Mainwaring and acted condescendingly towards his inexperienced rival, such as by deliberately mispronouncing Mainwaring's name. Despite his contempt of Mainwaring, Square was on excellent terms with Wilson, possibly because they had in common an upper class background. He was also very complimentary to Lance Corporal Jones in the episode Battle of the Giants!, noting Jones' many ribbons that he'd earned during the course of his military career, and telling Jones that on his chest he carried \"an illuminated history of the British Empire\". In the episode \"A. Wilson (Manager)?\", he commissioned Wilson as the lieutenant of his Eastgate platoon. Square could be overconfident at times, and Mainwaring and the Walmington platoon did sometimes get the better of him and his platoon."]}, {"page": "A Brush with the Law", "response": ["*Geoffrey Lumsden as Captain Square"]}, {"page": "Wake Up Walmington", "response": ["*Geoffrey Lumsden as Captain Square"]}, {"page": "A Dandy in Aspic", "response": ["* Geoffrey Lumsden as Ridley"]}, {"page": "Dateline Diamonds", "response": ["*Geoffrey Lumsden \u2013 Army Officer"]}, {"page": "Lance Sieveking", "response": ["*\"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde\", (Robert Louis Stevenson/Lance Sieveking) with Cyril Shaps, Richard Williams, Manning Wilson, Gordon Davies, James Thomason & Geoffrey Lumsden (8.2.1956)"]}, {"page": "Night Caller from Outer Space", "response": ["* Geoffrey Lumsden as Colonel Davy"]}, {"page": "Doctor at Large (TV series)", "response": ["To revise for his primary fellowship exams Michael stays at a health farm run on strict lines by a Mr Moon (John Le Mesurier) where Dick Stuart-Clark has an easy job as the resident doctor.
