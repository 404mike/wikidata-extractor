He is usually considered the first lord of Padua (signore), his election marking the transition from commune ad singularem dominum (to a single lord), a characteristic regime known as a signoria to contemporaries.Gregorio Piaia (2004), \"The Shadow of Antenor: On the Relationship between the Defensor Pacis and the Institutions of the City of Padua,\" Politische Reflexion in der Welt des sp\u00e4ten Mittelalters: Political thought in the age of scholasticism: Essays in honour of J\u00fcrgen Miethke, J\u00fcrgen Miethke and Martin Kaufhold, edd.

In response to the threat of the Ghibellines and continuous internal feuding, shortly after 25 July 1318 the Paduan aristocracy elected Jacopo as defensor, protector, and gubernator in perpetuity.John Kenneth Hyde (1966), Padua in the age of Dante (Manchester: Manchester University Press), 3. Jacopo's election owed something to an alliance between Padua's own Ghibelline and Guelph factions, and after his election many Ghibelline exiles returned. Jacopo sent the poet Albertino Mussato, who objected to the signoria and pined for the old commune, into exile that year. In 1319 the Ghibelline Cangrande I della Scala besieged Padua and demanded the abdication of Jacopo in return for peace. Jacopo stepped down temporarily to save the city; the signoria was transferred to Frederick the Fair, a contender for the Holy Roman Empire. In the end Jacopo succeeded in preventing Padua from falling to either the Scaligeri or the Scrovegni."]}, {"page": "De laude Cestrie", "response": ["The classical archaeologist Margerie Venables Taylor prepared a greatly abridged edition, incorporating only about 9% of the text, which was published by the Record Society of Lancashire and Cheshire in 1912. Her edition focuses on the parts of the manuscript relating to the geography and history of Cheshire and its environs. Taylor disliked Lucian's style, writing that \"[m]etaphor and allegory are worked to death\", and she lacked interest in the religious aspects of the text, which she described as \"one long sermon disguised as a guide-book\". Several 20th-century reviewers of this edition, including Kenneth Hyde and Elizabeth Danbury, criticised the style, reliance on allegory and quality of the Latin."]}, {"page": "John Kenneth Hyde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Hyde"]}, {"page": "J.
