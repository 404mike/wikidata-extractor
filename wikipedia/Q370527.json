He won the Scottish Premier League title in his second season with the club in 2012 and both the league and the Scottish Cup in 2013. He signed for Crystal Palace in January 2014 and played three and a half Premier League seasons for them.\nLedley has played for Wales at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels, before making his full debut in 2005.

He sold Aiden McGeady for a then Scottish record \u00a39.5 million along with captain Stephen McManus and goalkeeper Artur Boruc. 13 other players also left the club, this gave Lennon enough funds to re-build for the new season. Lennon then went on to sign several talented, young, cheap, relatively unknown players, from smaller leagues around the world; striker Gary Hooper arrived from English side Scunthorpe, Israeli international Beram Kayal was signed, and Honduran left-back Emilio Izaguirre also signed on. Lennon also signed several experienced players on free transfers. Charlie Mulgrew, Joe Ledley, and Daniel Majstorovi\u0107 all went into the first team. In addition to these Lennon also signed five other players, including Fraser Forster on loan from Newcastle who became first choice 'keeper and helped set a new SPL record for most clean sheets. thumb|right|Emilio Izaguirre was voted SPFA Player of the Year in 2011", "On 28 July, in his first competitive game as full-time manager, Celtic lost 3\u20130 away to Braga in the UEFA Champions League. Celtic won their first eight league matches under Lennon, although controversy erupted in their 2\u20131 win away at Dundee United on 17 October 2010. Celtic were awarded a penalty kick in the second half, but the decision was then rescinded by referee Dougie McDonald. McDonald explained after the match that he over-ruled the penalty award on the advice of the assistant referee. Lennon reluctantly accepted McDonald's explanation, commenting \"I suppose you have to put it down to another honest mistake by the referee.\" It was, however, later revealed that McDonald had lied in his explanation over the penalty award and the referee subsequently resigned several weeks later having received a warning from the Scottish Football Association after failing to properly explain his overturning of the penalty award. Further referring controversy ensued the following week when Celtic lost their unbeaten run in the league, losing 3\u20131 at home against Rangers. The Ibrox club's third goal came as a result of penalty awarded when Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot fell to the ground under a challenge from Celtic's Daniel Majstorovi\u0107. Broadfoot appeared to have dived, and television footage showed that the referee had his back to the play when the challenge occurred, only turning in time to see Broadfoot fall to the ground. Lennon stated afterwards that he felt the referee \"got a couple of decisions wrong\", and added regarding the penalty, \"I'm not sure that he saw it so I don't know why he's given it. He's got a lot of questions to answer\". In November, Lennon led Celtic to a 9\u20130 win over Aberdeen, a record win in the Scottish Premier League and Aberdeen's heaviest ever defeat. Celtic lost their next game 2\u20130 away against Hearts, with Celtic's Joe Ledley sent off for the first time in his career for a \"strong\" challenge on Ian Black. Celtic were later denied a penalty award in the second half, and shortly afterwards Lennon was sent to the stand by the referee. Lennon defended Ledley after the match, describing referee Craig Thomson's decision as \"ridiculous\". Lennon was later given a six match touchline ban for excessive misconduct as a result of the incident in the Hearts' game, although it was later reduced to four matches after appeal. He was given another four match touchline ban by the SFA following an altercation with Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist after a Scottish Cup match in March 2011."]}, {"page": "Peter Whittingham", "response": ["On 11 January 2007, after making just five appearances for Villa since the end of his loan spell with Derby more than a year previously, Whittingham was transferred to Cardiff City for a reported fee of \u00a3350,000.

He helped the club keep three consecutive clean sheets between 20 August 2005 and 10 September 2005. Despite serving a suspension for picking up five yellow cards this season so far, Hall continued to start eleven matches in the centre\u2013back position, forming a partnership with Darren Ward. This lasted until he missed one match, due to suffering from a knock during a 1\u20131 draw against rivals, Millwall on 3 December 2005 and was substituted in the 59th minute. Halfway through the season, many Crystal Palace fans felt that Hall's performance was being hindered by the burden of captaincy, and after several poor performances, and several yellow cards, Hughes was re-appointed team captain in January 2006. Despite losing the captaincy, Hall remained in the first team until the end of the season, where at one point, he played in a full\u2013back position. During a 1\u20130 win against Cardiff City on 4 February 2006, Hall received a straight red card following an off-the-ball incident involving Joe Ledley and served a three match suspension. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the starting line\u2013up, in a 1\u20131 draw against rivals, Millwall on 18 February 2006. This was followed up by scoring his second goal of the season, in a 4\u20131 win against Norwich City. After missing two matches due to another injury, his return saw him contribute to the club's place in the Championship play\u2013offs. Hall played in both legs of the Championship play\u2013offs against Watford, as Crystal Palace lost 3\u20130. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he went on to make forty\u2013four appearances and scoring once in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Wayne Routledge", "response": ["In November 2008 after making just one league appearance for Aston Villa so far during the season, Routledge was allowed to join Championship club Cardiff City on a two-month loan deal after the club suffered a double injury blow when both Joe Ledley and Peter Whittingham were ruled out for one and three months respectively. He made his debut for the club on 22 November in a 2\u20131 defeat to Plymouth Argyle during which he supplied the through pass for Michael Chopra to score Cardiff's only goal of the match. He scored his first goal for the club in just his second match when he found the net against Reading during a 2\u20132 draw on 25 November.

Brown helped Celtic to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final, which Celtic won 3\u20130 against Motherwell. This allowed him to collect his first trophy as Celtic captain. Brown played 39 times for Celtic, scoring four goals, during the 2010\u201311 season. He was often used on the right of midfield, partly due to the form of other central midfielders such as Beram Kayal, Joe Ledley and Ki Sung-Yueng, but also because Brown is more able to play in wide areas than them."]}, {"page": "Paul Parry", "response": ["Towards the end of the season, with a lack of strikers at the club, Parry was used primarily as a striker, playing alongside either Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Steve Thompson, and he would go on to finish the season as the club's joint top scorer, along with Joe Ledley, with 11 goals in all competitions. In April he suffered a hamstring injury during a 0\u20130 draw against West Bromwich Albion and he was forced to miss the remaining league games of the season as well as the FA Cup semi-final win over Barnsley. The injury meant he was forced into a long wait over his chances of appearing in the final, but he did eventually manage to return in time and played all 90 minutes in a 1\u20130 defeat to Portsmouth."]}, {"page": "Mark Kennedy (footballer, born 1976)", "response": ["Kennedy was signed by his former Wolves manager Dave Jones at Cardiff City on 10 July 2008.\"Cardiff sign Kennedy from Palace\" BBC Sport Retrieved on 1 June 2009 With club stalwart Joe Ledley cemented in the left midfield role, Kennedy started the season at left-back in place of the injured Tony Capaldi but an injury to Kennedy himself meant he missed around half of the opening two months.

His second came after he won a penalty which he converted to secure the victory. His efforts in this game won him Goal.com's World Player of the Week Award. In the following game, a Scottish Cup tie against Berwick Rangers, Samaras again started but failed to last the 90 minutes after sustaining a hamstring injury.
