Another noted performance was his innings of 84 against a Pontarddulais side which included his county teammate James Harris.

In the next match against Kent, starting the following day on the same ground, he took 8/96 in the first innings, bowling a 41 over spell to see the innings through. He helped secure victory for Somerset with another 6 wickets in the second innings. At only 17 years and 5 months, this ten-wicket haul made him the youngest player to do so in the County Championship, a record that stood until May 2007, when James Harris completed the feat a few days after his 17th birthday. A third game without break on the ground against Leicestershire brought further success for Langford, although his 6/53 in the first innings and 5/81 in the second weren't enough to prevent Somerset from slipping to a 144 run loss. Unfortunately for Somerset and Langford, the 26 wickets he took his opening three matches for the county accounted for just over half of his season's total, as he took just 25 more in the remaining 15 matches in 1953."]}, {"page": "2008 Twenty20 Cup", "response": ["Having waited fifteen days to play their quarter-final, Durham progressed to Finals Day after a 44-run win at the Riverside.
