It was expected that by that time William Wakefield would have bought land for the first settlement and had it surveyed, and also inspected the company's land claims at Kaipara and Hokianga.", "In April the Rev. Henry Williams was sent south by Hobson to seek further signatures to the treaty in the Port Nicholson area. He was forced to wait for 10 days before local chiefs would approach him and blamed their reluctance to sign the treaty on pressure by William Wakefield. On 29 April, however, Williams was able to report that Port Nicholson chiefs had \"unanimously\" signed the treaty. William Wakefield was already strongly critical of both the treaty and Williams and repeatedly attacked the missionary in the company's newspaper for his \"hypocrisy and unblushing rapaciousness\".", "Ignoring the wishes of William Wakefield, who wanted the initial settlement at the southwest side of the harbour where there were excellent anchorages for ships, Surveyor-General William Mein Smith began in January 1840 to layout 1100 one-acre (4047 m2) sections of the town, initially called \"Britannia\", on the flat land at Pito-one (now Petone), at the north of the harbour. The sections, near the mouth of the Hutt River, were laid out in parallelograms, with the plan including boulevards and public parks. Settlers who had bought a town section had also bought 100 \"country acres\" (about 40ha), where they could grow their food. Smith considered it important to locate the town and country areas close together and the Hutt Valley appeared to promise that space. The drawback was that his chosen locality was a mix of dense forest, scrub, flax and swamp, its river was prone to flooding and the beach so flat that when the first passenger ships began to arrive\u2014just four days after Smith began his survey work\u2014they were forced to anchor 1600 metres from the shore. But construction of temporary houses began, as well as the assembly of wooden houses that had been carried on each ship, while tents also soon dotted the dunes behind the beach. Local M\u0101ori assisted with the construction and also provided food\u2014fish, potatoes and other vegetables and occasionally pork.Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845, page 196.", "In line with his instructions, Wakefield promised local M\u0101ori they would be given reserves of land equal to one-tenth of the area, with their allotments chosen by lottery and sprinkled among the European settlers. The reserves were to remain inalienable to ensure that the M\u0101ori would not quickly sell the land to speculators. Jerningham Wakefield, the nephew of William Wakefield who had also arrived on the Tory in 1839, espoused the company's hope that interspersing M\u0101ori with white settlers would help them change their \"rude and uncivilised habits\". In a later book on his New Zealand adventures he wrote: \"The constant example before their eyes, and constant emulation to attain the same results, would naturally lead the inferior race, by an easy ascent, to a capacity for acquiring the knowledge, habits, desires and comforts of their civilised neighbours.\"Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub.

In a meeting with local M\u0101ori, expedition leader Arthur Wakefield claimed to have gained recognition \u2013 in exchange for \"presents\" of axes, a gun, gunpowder, blankets, biscuits and pipes \u2013 for the 1839 \"purchases\" in the area by William Wakefield. By January 1842 the advance guard had built more than 100 huts on the site of the future town in preparation for the arrival of the first settlers. A month later the township was described as having a population of 500, along with bullocks, sheep, pigs and poultry, although the company was yet to identify or purchase any of the rural land for which purchasers had paid.", "Hobson visited the Wellington area for the first time in August 1841 and heard complaints first-hand from M\u0101ori both in the town and also from as far afield as Porirua and Kapiti that they had never sold their land. Hobson assured them that their unsold p\u0101 and cultivations would be protected, but within days provided William Wakefield with a schedule, dated 1 September, which identified 110,000 acres at Port Nicholson, Porirua and Manawatu, 50,000 acres at Wanganui and 50,000 acres (later lifted to 60,000 acres) at New Plymouth; the government would waive its rights of pre-emption in those defined areas (thus abandoning any move to reclaim or resell lands possibly still owned by \"residents\" in the wake of the company's purchase from the \"overlords\"), and in a confidential note Hobson promised that the government would \"sanction any equitable arrangement you may make to induce those natives who reside within the limits referred to in the accompanying schedule, to yield up possession of their habitations\" as long as no force was used.D.

Spain quickly discovered that the New Zealand Company purchases in the Port Nicholson, Wanganui, and New Plymouth districts were hotly contested by M\u0101ori. In Wellington several important chiefs, notably those of Te Aro, Pipitea and Kumutoto p\u0101 took little or no part in the proceedings. Those in favour of \"selling\" the land gave two main reasons for their stance: European arms and settlement would give them protection against their enemies, notably the Ng\u0101ti Raukawa of \u014ctaki who were expected to attack at any time; and they were aware of the wealth that a European settlement\u2014\"their Pakeha\"\u2014would bring them through trade and employment. Some sales were also motivated by complex power struggles among M\u0101ori iwi, with assent to purchases deemed as proof of status. Company officials and the Colonial Office in London each argued that if the M\u0101ori were to be compensated for land they had not sold, the other should pay it; the Colonial Office claimed that its agreement of November 1840 was made on the assumption that the company's claim was valid,Rose Daamen, \"The Crown's Right of Pre-Emption and Fitzroy's Waiver Purchases\", Waitangi Tribunal, August 1998, page 48. while the company objected to being asked to prove that M\u0101ori in all transactions had both understood the contracts and had the right to sell. Company representatives in London attempted to challenge the legality of Spain's inquiry and instructed William Wakefield that he should not answer to it.", "The Taranaki ruling led to Spain's downfall. Spain had made the decision based on information from William Wakefield that much of the Taranaki region had been sparsely populated by M\u0101ori at the time of the purchase. The cause of the depopulation was that most of the local Te \u0100ti Awa population had either migrated to \u014ctaki or the Cook Strait region after defeat by raiding Waikato war parties in the 1820s, or been enslaved by the Waikato, but many were now returning. Spain ruled that regardless of the reason for their departure, Te \u0100ti Awa had forfeited the land and that the company purchase from the few remaining residents was valid. With tensions between settlers and M\u0101ori in Taranaki at an all-time high, and alerted by Protector of Aborigines George Clarke of problems with Spain's Taranaki ruling, FitzRoy sailed in August 1844 for New Plymouth, where he was briefed by Bishop George Selwyn and then announced he would reverse Spain's decision. Instead of the 60,000 acres in Taranaki, the company would be awarded just 3800 acres, where settlers were already located. The decision outraged settlers, who were aware of friction with returning M\u0101ori, but had been hoping the Governor would station a body of troops at New Plymouth or sanction the formation of a militia to protect their land. FitzRoy later wrote: \"It appeared so clear  ... that the view taken by the land commissioner could not be adopted by the government without causing bloodshed, and the probable ruin of the settlement; because the injustice of awarding land to the New Zealand Company, which was well known not to have been purchased by them, was apparent to every native.\" FitzRoy's decision infuriated Spain, whose resignation was then demanded by the Governor."]}, {"page": "Edward Gibbon Wakefield", "response": ["By the turn of the twenty-first century, the direct descendants of the Wakefield family left in New Zealand were William Wakefield Lawrence Clague resident in Kapiti, and descendants of Edward's sister Catherine Gurney Wakefield who married Charles Torlesse.

In fact Spain was determined to investigate thoroughly the background of all land purchases including whether Maori who had sold land had the right to do so. His interrogation of witnesses was exhaustive, with lengthy evidence taken and recorded in both Maori and English.
