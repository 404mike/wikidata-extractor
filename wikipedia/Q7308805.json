He is credited with being the first pilot to destroy a Zeppelin, when in October 1914 he bombed the airship sheds at D\u00fcsseldorf. A flying accident in 1916 ended his flying career, but he remained in the Royal Air Force, serving in various staff positions, and during the Second World War commanded two reconnaissance groups, and from 1943 to 1945 the group responsible for ferrying aircraft from North America to Europe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zeppelin", "response": ["Early offensive operations by Army airships revealed that they were extremely vulnerable to ground fire unless flown at high altitude, and several were lost. No bombs had been developed, and the early raids dropped artillery shells instead. On 5 August 1914 Z\u00a0VI bombed Li\u00e8ge. Flying at a relatively low altitude because of cloud cover, the airship was damaged by small-arms fire and was destroyed in a forced landing near Bonn.Robinson 1973, p.85 On 21 August Z\u00a0VII and Z\u00a0VIII were damaged by ground fire while supporting German army operations in Alsace, and Z\u00a0VIII was lost.Robinson 1973, pp.86-7 On the night of 24/25 August Z\u00a0IX bombed Antwerp, dropping bombs near the royal palace and killing five people. A second, less effective, raid was made on the night of 1\u20132 September and a third on 7 October, but on 8 October Z\u00a0IX was destroyed in its hangar at D\u00fcsseldorf by Flt Lt. Reginald Marix, RNAS. The RNAS had also bombed the Zeppelin bases in Cologne on 22 September 1914. On the eastern front, Z\u00a0V was brought down by ground fire on 28 August during the Battle of Tannenberg; most of the crew were captured. Z\u00a0IV bombed Warsaw on 24 September and was also used to support German army operations in East Prussia. By the end of 1914 the Army's airship strength was reduced to four.", "At the beginning of the conflict the German command had high hopes for the airships, which were considerably more capable than contemporary light fixed-wing machines: they were almost as fast, could carry multiple machine guns, and had enormously greater bomb-load range and endurance. Contrary to expectation, it was not easy to ignite the hydrogen using standard bullets and shrapnel. The Allies only started to exploit the Zeppelin's great vulnerability to fire when a combination of Pomeroy and Brock explosive ammunition with Buckingham incendiary ammunition was used in fighter aircraft machine guns during 1916. The British had been concerned over the threat posed by Zeppelins since 1909, and attacked the Zeppelin bases early in the war.

Three RNAS squadrons were swiftly deployed to Belgium and France, primarily to fly reconnaissance missions. Grey was in command of the RNAS squadron at Calais, when in early September an RNAS unit, comprising six aircraft taken from each squadron, were sent to Wilrijk aerodrome in Antwerp. Under the orders of Churchill, it was tasked with mounting the first long-distance bombing raid on Germany. Their targets were the airship sheds at D\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne, in order to forestall Zeppelin raids on England. For the first mission on 22 September, Baron Pierre de Caters provided a force of Belgian armoured cars which was sent out to create and defend a forward landing strip west of the Meuse, as the British aircraft did not have sufficient range to fly directly to their targets and back. The first raid was commanded by Squadron Commander Eugene Gerrard, who with Flight Lieutenant Reginald Marix, headed for Cologne, while Grey and Lieutenant Charles Collet flew to D\u00fcsseldorf. Their Sopwith aircraft had no fixed machine-guns, the pilots being armed only with revolvers, and carried only two or four  Hales bombs. By the time the four aircraft crossed the River Roer, fog obscured the ground and Collet was the only pilot to find his target, the airship shed at D\u00fcsseldorf. He dropped his bombs from a low level, but only one hit the shed, and it failed to explode."]}, {"page": "Frederick Marten Hale", "response": ["In 1913 Hale invented the Hale aircraft bomb.  It was the only aerial bomb available to British forces at the start of the First World War.  In October 1914 Hale bombs were used in a raid on an airship base in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.  Flight Lieutenant Reginald Marix hit a shed and destroyed Zeppelin , the first time a Zeppelin had been destroyed whilst still in its hangar.  On 7 June 1915 a Hale bomb was used by Flight Sub-Lieutenant Reginald Warneford to destroy Zeppelin LZ 37 over Ghent, Belgium, the first time a Zeppelin had been brought down by an aircraft.  Hale sent a silver replica of a  Hale aircraft bomb to the Air Department to commemorate the event.  A Hale bomb was also used in the first sinking of a U-boat by an aircraft and hundreds of thousands were dropped during the war.  Hale also developed the first depth charge for use by the Royal Navy to attack U-boats in November 1914."]}]}}
