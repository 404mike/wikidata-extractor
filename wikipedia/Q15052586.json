In the final five-week, following her rendition of Destiny's Child's \"Survivor\", male judges Mark Holden and Ian Dickson were not impressed with the tight-fitted gold dress Paulini wore for the performance. Dicko commented on the dress saying \"You should choose more appropriate clothes or shed some pounds\", which resulted in a great deal of debate and controversy in the media relating to self-esteem and body image of teenage girls. After hearing Dicko's comments, Paulini went backstage and cried. In an interview with Woman's Day magazine, 11 years after the comment was made, Paulini stated \"It affected me a lot and it really hurt my confidence.\" In the final four-week, Paulini was eliminated from the competition.
