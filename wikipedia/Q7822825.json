However, he only played once for the Baggies, and also had a short loan spell at neighbours Walsall. In April 1983, he was allowed to join Mansfield Town on a free transfer, and he made his debut for the Stags on 7 May 1983 against Peterborough United.Through the next five years, Lowery was almost ever-present in Mansfield's lineup, playing 40 or more league matches each season. He was noted for his work-rate and consistency in central midfield, and was a key member of the side that won promotion from Division Four in 1985-86, and won the Freight Rover Trophy in 1987.By 1988-89, injuries had started to take their toll, and Lowery only played sporadically in his final seasons at Field Mill. In September 1990, he was loaned to Walsall for the second time in his career, and in the summer of 1991, Mansfield manager George Foster decided not to offer Lowery a new contract. When he left the club, Lowery had played 317 first-team games for Mansfield and scored 27 goals.\nAfter leaving Mansfield, Lowery had a short spell at Carlisle United before returning to his native North East, where he joined non-league Gateshead, and later became assistant manager at Blyth Spartans. H was appointed manager of Bedlington Terriers in 1995 alongside Keith Perry and remained at the club until May 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wallsend", "response": ["*Tony Lowery"]}, {"page": "Blyth Spartans A.F.C.", "response": ["|Tony Lowery/David McCreery"]}, {"page": "Lavery", "response": ["*Tony Lowery (born 1961), English footballer", "*Tony Lowery(born 1969), American football player"]}, {"page": "1987 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["||MF ||4||Tony Lowery"]}, {"page": "1991 Wisconsin Badgers football team", "response": ["|Tony Lowery"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Tony Lowery"]}, {"page": "Peter Harrison (footballer)", "response": ["In 1995, he was appointed as Harry Dunn's replacement at Blyth Spartans. Harrison kept the caretaker managers Tony Lowery and David McCreery on as part of the backroom staff, with the intention of Lowery being his assistant coach and McCreery in a consultant role. However, after a few weeks, Lowery joined Bedlington Terriers and McCreery took up a new role in the US to help promote the inaugural Major League Soccer season. Harrison brought in his former Gateshead teammate Derek Bell soon afterwards, in a player-assistant role. Harrison led the club to sixth place in the 1995\u201396 season. He could not replicate the same form the following season, and after one win in ten matches, he handed in his resignation after a 4\u20130 defeat to Leek Town.
