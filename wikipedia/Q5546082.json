He appeared in eight first-class games for Kent's First XI between 1928 and 1929, having played for the Second XI since 1926. He played the vast majority of his cricket instead for Leicestershire - 225 appearances and over 8000 runs as a professional. His 1973 obituary in Wisden described him as \"an attacking bat and a glorious field.\" His right-handed batting brought him five centuries for Leicestershire, and he took a single wicket with very occasional left-arm medium pace bowling.A keen footballer, he also played twice for England in 1930 as an amateur, and played for Charlton Athletic, Maidstone United, Crystal Palace, Nuneaton Town and Gloucester City.He died in Guildford, Surrey, in 1974.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Watson", "response": ["George Watson may refer to:", "* George Watson (MP) (1768\u20131824), MP for Canterbury", "* George Watson (mayor) (1852\u20131923), mayor of Brisbane", "* George Watson (rugby) (1885\u20131961), Australian rugby footballer", "* George Watson (Australian rules footballer) (1922\u20131978), Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy", "* George Watson (baseball) (1881\u2013?), American baseball player", "* George Watson (cricketer, born 1907) (1907\u20131974), Kent CCC cricketer", "* George Watson (cricketer, born 1855) (1855\u20131884), New Zealand cricketer", "* George Watson (footballer, born 1905) (1905\u20131991), English football goalkeeper", "* George Watson (umpire), Australian Test cricket umpire", "* George Watson (cyclist) (1891\u2013?), Canadian Olympic cyclist", "* George Watson (bowls), Irish lawn bowls player", "* George Watson (painter) (1767\u20131837), Scottish painter", "* George Watson (Royal Navy officer) (1827\u20131897), British Admiral", "* George Watson (United States Army Air Corps) (1920\u20132017), supply sergeant and support personnel for the Tuskegee Airmen", "* George Watson (Medal of Honor) (1915\u20131943), US soldier awarded the Medal of Honor in 1997 for actions during World War II", "* George Watson (accountant) (1654\u20131723), Scottish accountant and the founder of George Watson's College in Edinburgh", "* George Watson (scholar) (1927\u20132013), Fellow at St. John's College, Cambridge University", "* George Watson's College, a co-educational independent day school in Scotland", "* George Watson-Taylor (1771\u20131841), MP"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Leicestershire had fourteen defeats and finished fourteenth. In Les Berry, they had the only professional captain in the County Championship. In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, Vic Jackson, Gerry Lester, Francis Prentice, Maurice Tompkin and George Watson all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder Anthony Riddington scored over 800. Wicketkeeper Percy Corrall claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was Jack Walsh, a great exponent of slow left-arm wrist-spin, who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran James Sperry bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler. Other players were Thomas Chapman, Jack Howard and Harry Pickering.Playfair, pp. 106\u2013107."]}, {"page": "George Watson (Kent cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Watson (cricketer, born 1907)"]}]}}
