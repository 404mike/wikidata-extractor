The railway also served Channel ports and a number of attractive coastal destinations which provided the focus for media attention.  This meant that the railway operated a number of famous named trains, providing another source of publicity for John Elliot.  The Eastern and Central Sections of the network served popular seaside resorts such as Brighton, Eastbourne, Hastings and the Channel ports, whilst the Western Section catered for the heavy summer holiday traffic to the West Country resorts.  Passenger services on the Southern Railway consisted of luxury Pullman dining trains and normal passenger services, which gave the railway a high total number of carriages at 10,800.", "The Southern Railway was particularly successful at promoting itself to the public. The downgrading of the Mid-Sussex line via Horsham that served Portsmouth was met with hostility by the general public, causing a public relations disaster.Whitehouse, & Thomas, p. 18 This stimulated the creation of the first \"modern\" public relations department with the appointment of John Elliot (later Sir John Elliot) in 1925. Elliot was instrumental in creating the positive image that the Southern enjoyed prior to the Second World War, building a publicity campaign for its electrification project that marketed the \"World's Greatest Suburban Electric\".", "Sir John Elliot Acting General Manager (1947); Assistant General Manager (1933 to nationalisation); Public Relations Assistant (1925\u20131933).

Elliot suggested that the Southern's express passenger locomotives should be named, representing positive publicity for the railway, while distinctive locomotive liveries and well-known posters were created under his direction. He continued to serve the railways after nationalisation in 1948, and became Chairman of London Transport in 1953."]}, {"page": "British Railways Board", "response": ["*Sir John Elliot (1951\u20131953)Bonavia, pp. 30, 62, 85"]}, {"page": "LSWR N15 class", "response": ["When the former Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to Maunsell's N15 specification in February 1925, the Southern Railway decided to give names to all express passenger locomotives. Because of the railway's association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, John Elliot suggested that members of the N15\u00a0class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: \"Tell Sir Herbert [Walker] I have no objection, but I warn you, it won't make any difference to the working of the engines\". Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell's permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No.\u00a0E453, was given the first name and christened King Arthur. The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as \"Urie Arthurs\"; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the \"Eastleigh\" and \"Scotch Arthurs\".Nock (British Locomotives vol. 1: 1983), p. 241"]}, {"page": "Southern Region of British Railways", "response": ["The Transport Act 1947 provided for the nationalisation of all heavy rail systems in the UK to allow for this investment and, in theory, to improve the rights of railway workers.

In 1949 a review of the Victorian Railways was commissioned by transport minister Kent Hughes, and was carried out by British Railways Chief Executive John Elliot. The report found much to admire in the management and staff, but criticised the run-down locomotives, rolling stock, and track and predicted a \"final breakdown of rail transport\" in ten years if nothing was done. The ideas of the report were not new, the Victorian Railways had been making plans for modernisation of their operations, but did not have the money or political will to implement them."]}, {"page": "List of heads of public transport authorities in London", "response": ["*Sir John Elliot, 1953\u20131959"]}, {"page": "Thomas Cook's Rugby Club", "response": ["Sir John Elliot (railway manager), Chairman (1959\u201367)"]}, {"page": "Ian Allan (publisher)", "response": ["Allan was born at Christ's Hospital independent school, Horsham, Sussex, where his father, G.A.T.
