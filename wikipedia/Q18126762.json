He was born in Cambridge and died at Kaiteriteri, Tasman Region, New Zealand.\nMarshall was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first first-class cricket match as a tail-end right-handed batsman for Cambridge Town Club in 1857 also featured his elder brother, Joseph, who played for Cambridge University between 1855 and 1857, winning three Blues for cricket. John Marshall then won a Blue himself as a middle-order batsman for Cambridge University in 1859, appearing in the University Match against Oxford and top-scoring with an unbeaten 38 in the first innings: he scored just 7 in the second innings in a low-scoring game that Cambridge won by 28 runs. Marshall did not play in first-class cricket for Cambridge University after 1859; most of the rest of his cricket was for Cambridgeshire, then considered one of the major cricketing county sides, and his highest score was an unbeaten 47 in the home match against Surrey in 1861. He later played in minor matches for Suffolk.", "link_mentions": {}}}
