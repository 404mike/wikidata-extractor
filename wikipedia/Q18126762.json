He was born in Cambridge and died at Kaiteriteri, Tasman Region, New Zealand.\nMarshall was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first first-class cricket match as a tail-end right-handed batsman for Cambridge Town Club in 1857 also featured his elder brother, Joseph, who played for Cambridge University between 1855 and 1857, winning three Blues for cricket. John Marshall then won a Blue himself as a middle-order batsman for Cambridge University in 1859, appearing in the University Match against Oxford and top-scoring with an unbeaten 38 in the first innings: he scored just 7 in the second innings in a low-scoring game that Cambridge won by 28 runs. Marshall did not play in first-class cricket for Cambridge University after 1859; most of the rest of his cricket was for Cambridgeshire, then considered one of the major cricketing county sides, and his highest score was an unbeaten 47 in the home match against Surrey in 1861. He later played in minor matches for Suffolk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Marshall (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Marshall (1755\u20131835) was Chief Justice of the United States.", "John Marshall or John Marshal may also refer to:", "* John Marshall (filmmaker) (1932\u20132005), American anthropologist and documentary filmmaker", "* John Marshall (drummer) (born 1941), British jazz-rock drummer", "* John Marshall (musician) (born 1954), American percussionist", "* John Marshall (cartoonist) (born 1955), American comic strip artist", "* John Marshall (guitarist), guitarist for rock band Metal Church", "* John Marshall, Lord Curriehill (1794\u20131868), British judge", "* John Marshall Harlan ((1833\u20131911), U.S. Supreme Court justice", "* John Marshall Harlan II (1899\u20131971), U.S. Supreme Court justice", "* John Marshall (British captain) (1748\u20131819), British explorer, namesake of the Marshall Islands", "* John Marshall (biographer) (c. 1784\u20131837), officer in the British Royal Navy and author", "* John Marshall (MP for Cambridge), MP for Cambridge, 1388\u201390", "* John Marshall (MP for Totnes), MP for Totnes, 1395", "* John Marshall (MP for New Romney), MP for New Romney, 1535\u201339", "* John Marshall (MP for Leeds, died 1836) (1797\u20131836), English politician, Member of Parliament for Leeds", "* John Marshall (industrialist) (1765\u20131845), British businessman and politician", "* John Marshall (Conservative politician) (born 1940), British MEP, 1979\u201389, and MP, 1987\u201397", "* John Marshall (Kentucky politician) (1856\u20131922), Lieutenant governor of Kentucky", "* John Marshall (Kansas judge), Justice of the Kansas Supreme Court from 1915 to 1931", "*John Marshall (bishop) (died 1496), Bishop of Llandaff", "*John Marshall (priest) (1534\u20131597), English Roman Catholic priest", "*John Marshall (archaeologist) (1876\u20131958), Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, 1902\u20131928", "*John Marshall (surgeon) (1818\u20131891), English surgeon and teacher of anatomy", "*John Marshall (eye laser scientist) (born 1943), British professor of ophthalmology", "*John Marshall (oceanographer), American oceanographer", "*John Marshall (cricketer, born 1796) (1796\u20131876), Australian cricketer", "*John Marshall (cricketer, born 1816) (1816\u20131861), English cricketer", "*John Marshall (cricketer, born 1837) (1837\u20131879), English clergyman and cricketer", "*John Marshall (cricket writer)", "*John Marshall (American football) (born 1945), NFL assistant coach", "*John Marshall (footballer, born 1964), English footballer", "*John Marshall (Third Lanark footballer), Scottish footballer", "*John Marshall (rugby union) (1929\u20132012), Scotland rugby union player", "*John Marshall (swimmer) (1930\u20131957), Australian swimmer", "*John Marshall (sailor) (born 1942), representative of United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics", "*John Marshall (jockey) (c.1958\u20132018), Australian jockey", "*John Marshall (athlete) (born 1963), American middle-distance track athlete", "*John Marshall (bowls), Scottish lawn bowler", "* John Marshall (publisher) (1756\u20131824), London publisher who specialized in children's literature", "* John Marshall (Newcastle publisher and printer)", "* John Marshall (author) (1845\u20131915), British classicist and rector of the Royal High School, Edinburgh", "* John Marshall (died 1928) (1860\u20131928), British antiquities art collector", "* John Marshall (North Dakota architect) (1864\u20131949), American architect", "* John Marshall (Scottish sculptor) (1888\u20131952)", "* John Marshall (sculptor) (1932\u20132009), American sculptor", "* John Marshall (railway historian) (1922\u20132008), English railway historian", "* John Marshall (historian), British historian at Johns Hopkins University", "* John Marshall (entrepreneur), American entrepreneur and inventor", "*Chief Justice John Marshall, an 1883 sculpture in Washington, D.C.", "*John Marshall Park, a park in Washington, D.C.", "*John Marshall Law School (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Great Barton", "response": ["*John Marshall (1837-1879), clergyman and a cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Cambridge Town Club and Cambridgeshire cricketers", "response": ["* John Marshall (1857\u20131867) : J.
