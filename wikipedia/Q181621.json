He was nominated for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award but it went to fellow Northern Ireland driver Jonny Kane. In 1996 he drove in Formula Opel and the following year he drove in the British Formula Three Championship where he finished 10th. In 1998 he moved up to Formula 3000 where he competed in the first five races for Raceprep Motorsport and rounds 7 through 9 for Nordic Racing. He competed full-time in 1999 for Nordic Racing and finished 10th in points despite only finishing in the points once, finishing on the podium in second in the season opener at Imola. He returned to the team and series in 2000, this time with teammate Justin Wilson. He finished 20th in points with a best finish of 4th at Monaco. In 2001 he left formula cars for sports car racing and drove in the 2001 24 Hours of Le Mans for the MG factory team, but the car failed to finish. He drove the same car in 2002 but the result was the same. He returned to the race in 2004 driving a Bioethanol powered Reynard-Judd for Team Nasamax, finishing the race 17th overall. He drove part-time in the Le Mans Series in 2006. He then joined McLaren Automotive as full-time test driver for the new McLaren car project the MP4-12C from the start of the project.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Blundell", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Julian Bailey Kevin McGarrity", "|align=\"left\"|  Julian Bailey Kevin McGarrity"]}, {"page": "Julian Bailey", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Mark Blundell Kevin McGarrity", "|align=\"left\"|  Mark Blundell Kevin McGarrity"]}, {"page": "2004 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robbie Stirling Werner Lupberger Kevin McGarrity"]}, {"page": "2002 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Mark Blundell Julian Bailey Kevin McGarrity"]}, {"page": "2001 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["The day's fastest laps were predicted to possibly be set within the opening fifteen minutes of the second session due to lowering ambient temperatures and light levels. Kristensen improved provisional pole position to a 3 minutes, 32.458 seconds lap seven minutes into the session to be four seconds faster than Allan McNish's 2000 pole lap. He was unable to improve any further because of an electrical misfire that affected the No. 1 Audi. Capello fell to second; the No. 2 car had a power steering fault just as Christian Pescatori relieved his co-driver. Kelleners moved Champion Racing to third after a change of gearbox. Lammers of Racing for Holland fell to fourth and Brundle's No. 7 Bentley was demoted to fifth because a punctured tyre on the Mulsanne Straight sent him into the gravel trap at Mulsanne Corner. Reid MG's No. 34 car had a possible blocked fuel filter that regulated its fuel pressure; the car kept the class pole of LMP675. Kevin McGarrity elevated the sister No. 33 MG to second in class and ROC Auto fell to third. In LMGTS, Oliver Gavin's No. 60 Saleen led the session and took the provisional class pole position from Corvette Racing. Fellows crashed into a tyre barrier at the second Mulsanne Chicane and the No. 63 Corvette sustained heavy rear-end damage. He was unhurt. The sole non-Porsche car in LMGT of the Aspen Knolls MCR-entered Callaway C12 of Cort Wagner moved to the front in class with Patrice Goueslard's No. 80 Larbre car second.", "As temperatures cooled in the final qualifying session due to fading light, Capello waited in his garage before he negotiated slower traffic to set a 3 minutes, 32.249 seconds lap in the No. 2 Audi and demoted Kristensen from pole position. Kristensen's No. 1 car had its damper unit and front bodywork changed and ran a race-tuned engine along with soft compound tyres; he could not better his teammate's lap because of a slow puncture when he ran into a gravel trap at the first Mulsanne Straight chicane, giving the No. 2 car pole position. Champion Racing were not able to improve their lap and took third. Lammers' third-session time secured Racing for Holland fourth and Johannson's No. 4 Audi took fifth. Anthony Reid twice reset the fastest lap in LMP675 to secure pole position for the No. 34 MG team with a 3 minutes, 41.769 seconds lap. Kevin McGarrity in the sister MG was second in class after an oil leak caused the team to change engines. Gen\u00e9's ROC Auto entry took third in the category. The GT categories remained the same with the No. 60 Saleen's lap time set by Gavin giving it pole position in the GTS class and Wagner's lap in LMGT was not bettered by any other driver. Team Advan's No. 72 Porsche driven by Kazuyuki Nishizawa had an accident at the Porsche Curves and sustained damage to its front and rear.", "|rowspan=2|  Julian Bailey Mark Blundell Kevin McGarrity"]}, {"page": "2006 Le Mans Series", "response": ["|  Kevin McGarrity"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of N\u00fcrburgring", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Kevin McGarrity Paul Cope Ben Collins"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Donington", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Nicolas Minassian Kevin McGarrity"]}, {"page": "2001 International Formula 3000 Championship", "response": ["The 2001 season saw several driver changes.
