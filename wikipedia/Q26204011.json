James Hanna made a second voyage in Sea Otter, from 1786 to 1787. This voyage was less successful than the first, but plans were made for a third voyage. However, these voyages led to Lord Cornwallis, Bengal's general governor, in 1787 complaining to the East India Company, all to no avail. By this time, other British ship captains had joined in the maritime fur trade, such as James Strange, John Meares, George Dixon, Nathaniel Portlock, as well as the Americans John Kendrick and Robert Gray of the ships Columbia Rediviva and Lady Washington. Evidence of their activity remains in the \"Columbia\" and Washington medals, which Boston merchants struck to celebrate the sailing in September 1787 of these two US vessels for the northwest coast of America. The British Admiralty had in 1772 issued similar medals (struck by Matthew Boulton) featuring  and  celebrating James Cook's second voyage."]}, {"page": "Imperial Eagle (ship)", "response": ["In March 1787 Barkley anchored Imperial Eagle in Nootka Sound, a port commonly used by fur trading vessels. Frances Barkley became the first European woman, and Win\u00e9e the first Hawaiian, or Kanaka, known to have visited the Pacific Northwest.Washington State Place Names, pp. 111-112 Imperial Eagle was the largest ship to have ever entered Friendly Cove, the main anchorage in Nootka Sound. It was also the first fur trading vessel to arrive at Nootka Sound that year. As a result, Barkley was able to acquire all of the available furs. At Nootka, Dr. John Mackay was found living with the indigenous Nuu-chah-nulth. Mackey had been the surgeon of the fur trading brig Captain Cook, under Captain James Strange, who had left Mackay at Nootka in July 1786, with the intention that Mackay befriend the indigenous people, learn their customs, and collect sea otter pelts for trade when Strange returned. But Strange did not return. Mackay was overjoyed to join the crew of Imperial Eagle.Washington State Place Names, p. 111 Mackay taught Barkley much about the indigenous peoples and how to trade with them. He also provided valuable geographical information about the waters south of Nootka Sound, which gave Barkley an advantage over other traders such as James Colnett, who arrived shortly after Barkley. Barkley stayed at Nootka Sound for some time and acquired about 700 prime sea otter pelts and many more of inferior quality. Frances Barkley wrote about chief Maquinna. She was impressed with his management of the fur trade. Some time after Barkley's arrival, two more fur trading ships entered Nootka Sound\u2014Prince of Wales under James Colnett, and  under Charles Duncan, both owned by the King George's Sound Company. To their chagrin they found that Barkley had already acquired all the furs available at Nootka Sound."]}, {"page": "Maritime fur trade", "response": ["The early maritime fur traders were explorers, as well as traders. The Northwest Coast is very complex \u2014 a \"labyrinth of waters\", according to George Simpson\u2014 with thousands of islands, numerous straits and fjords, and a mountainous, rocky, and often very steep shoreline. Navigational hazards included persistent rain, high winds, thick fogs, strong currents, and tides, and hidden rocks. Wind patterns were often contrary, variable, and baffling, especially within the coastal straits and archipelagoes, which makes sailing dangerous. Early explorations before the maritime fur trade era\u2014by Juan P\u00e9rez, Bruno de Heceta, Bogeda y Quadra, and James Cook\u2014produced only rough surveys of the coast's general features. Detailed surveys were undertaken in only a few relatively small areas, such as Nootka Sound, Bucareli Bay, and Cook Inlet.Hayes (1999), pp. 35\u201345 Russian exploration before 1785 had produced mainly rough surveys, largely restricted to the Aleutian Islands and mainland Alaska west of Cape Saint Elias.Hayes (1999), pp. 29\u201332, 52\u201353, 63, 66 British and American maritime fur traders began visiting the Northwest Coast in 1785, at which time it was mostly unexplored. Although noncommercial exploration voyages continued, especially by the Spanish Navy,Hayes (1999), pp. 67\u201381 the maritime fur traders made a number of significant discoveries. Notable examples include the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Clayoquot Sound, and Barkley Sound, all found by Charles William Barkley, Queen Charlotte Strait by James Strange, Fitz Hugh Sound by James Hanna, Grays Harbor and the Columbia River by Robert Gray. George Dixon explored the Dixon Entrance and was the first to realize that the Queen Charlotte Islands were not part of the mainland.Hayes (1999), pp. 55\u201358, 62, 82"]}, {"page": "James Hanna (trader)", "response": ["Encouraged by this financial success, Hanna's backers sponsored a second voyage in 1786. Leaving Macao in May he again reached Nootka Sound in August. He had been preceded by an expedition from Bombay led by James Strange, and as a result he was able to purchase only 50 sea otter skins. Sailing north he discovered and named a number of inlets and islands on the west coast of Vancouver Island. He made a chart of those parts he visited and bestowed the name of his patrons on several places, such as Cox's Island, Lane's Bay, Fitzhugh Sound, Lance's Islands and MacIntosh's Inlet.Alexander Walker, An Account of a Voyage to the North West Coast of America in 1785 & 1786, edited by Robin Fisher and J.M. Bumsted, Vancouver, Douglas & McIntyre; Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1982, pp.199\u2013203. Seeing land to the north, which was probably the islands off the continent or even Kunghit Island, the southernmost island of Haida Gwaii, the Irishman James Hanna named it Nova Hibernia, complete with a St. Patrick's Bay. These names, except Fitzhugh Sound, Cox Island and Lance's Island (now spelt, in the Spanish way Lanz Island), were ignored by later cartographers. He then sailed south to Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1796 British general election", "response": ["|James Strange"]}, {"page": "List of MPs in the first United Kingdom Parliament", "response": ["| James Strange"]}, {"page": "Nahwitti (trading site)", "response": ["Among the first Westerners to visit the area was James Hanna, who visited Sea Otter Cove in 1786, and James Strange, who in 1786 explored Queen Charlotte Sound and made contact with the Kwakwaka\u02bcwakw people on northern Vancouver Island. In 1792 Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano stopped at Nahwitti during his circumnavigation of Vancouver Island. Also in 1792, Robert Gray of the Columbia Rediviva visited and traded in the area."]}]}}
