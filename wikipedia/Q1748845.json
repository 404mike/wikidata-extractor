He played on their second album, Sad Wings of Destiny (1976).\nMoore was already active in the Birmingham rock, blues, folk and country scene, and played with numerous bands, including The Young Casuals, The Other Lot, The Outer Light, Gabriel Oak, Glad Stallion, Tendency Jones and Pendulum. He was first approached by the guitarist K. K. Downing and bass guitarist Ian Hill in 1971, and joined in the early and unofficial phase of the newborn Judas Priest for a period of about a year, while  Al Atkins was still the vocalist. He left in 1972 to join the Birmingham country rock band Sundance, with whom he recorded the album Rain, Steam, Speed (1974), and the single \"Coming Down\".\nIn 1975, the drummer John Hinch left Judas Priest and Downing and Hill approached Moore again. For the second time, he joined the band, making him the only drummer in its history to have two separate stints. His first show after re-joining was in October 1975 at Slough College, London, during which the guitarist/backing vocalist Glenn Tipton introduced \"our new drummer Skip\" who \"only had a few hours of rehearsal\". In 1976, the band recorded the album Sad Wings of Destiny. Despite its success, Moore decided to leave again, only this time permanently.\nMoore continued to play with numerous other bands and recording sessions. In 1981, he signed to Ariola Records with the band R.P.M., releasing two singles, \"Now That Summer's Here\" and \"Lost In Space\". After moving out of London, he continued to play with various \"scratch bands\" and session musicians. He later left music for a while and more or less faded into anonymity.\nOver the years, several musical biographers, journalists, band members and fans had tried to trace him without success. In the official biography The Story of Judas Priest: Defenders of the Faith, the author Neil Daniels said that, at the time it was written, Moore was the only former member of the band he could not trace at all.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Judas Priest", "response": ["The band recorded a two-song demo \"Good Time Woman\" and \"We'll Stay Together\" and eventually gained a three-album recording contract with the label Immediate in late 1969 after a gig in Walsall, but the label went out of business before an album could be recorded, and the band split in 1970. Late in the year, Atkins found a heavy rock band called Freight rehearsing without a singer, made up of K. K. Downing on guitars, his childhood friend Ian \"Skull\" Hill on bass, and drummer John Ellis. He joined them, and they took on Atkins' defunct band's name. Their first gig was on 6 March 1971. Ellis quit later that year and was replaced with Alan Moore. Early shows included Hendrix and Quatermass covers, and in 1972, the set list included the originals \"Never Satisfied\", \"Winter\", and the show-closer \"Caviar and Meths\". July 1971 also saw them making a 45 rpm demo of \"Mind Conception\" with \"Holy is the Man\" on the B side for the Zella Records label.", "The band performed \"Rocka Rolla\" on BBC Two's The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1975, as well as the \"Dreamer Deceiver\"\u2013\"Deceiver\" pair the year before the songs appeared on Sad Wings of Destiny. Hinch left the band for reasons that are disputed and was replaced with Alan Moore, who returned to the band in October 1975. Finances were tight: band members restricted themselves to one meal a day\u2014and several took on part-time work\u2014while they recorded their follow-up album on a budget of \u00a32,000.

It is considered the album on which Judas Priest consolidated their sound and image, and songs from it such as \"Victim of Changes\" and \"The Ripper\" have since become live standards. It was the band's only album to feature drummer Alan Moore.", "By the time Judas Priest's first album, Rocka Rolla, was released in 1974, there had been so many lineup changes that no original member remained.  The first album displayed a mix of styles from a wide variety of influences; the band found the performance and production disappointing.  The band gigged occasionally through 1975, at times sharing the stage with bands such as Pink Fairies and UFO.  Drummer John Hinch left the band for reasons that are disputed and was replaced with Alan Moore in October 1975, who had drummed in an early incarnation of the band.", "* Alan Moore\u00a0\u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Sin After Sin", "response": ["Sin After Sin is the third studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 8 April 1977 by Columbia Records.

Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover was hired to produce the album with Mark Dodson serving as engineer. The band's studio experiences while with Gull were less than satisfying, particularly during the mixing of Rocka Rolla, and they were initially quite keen to produce Sin After Sin themselves. CBS, however, insisted on an experienced producer. Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover was suggested and the band agreed, but after one session the band fired Glover, informing him that they would continue on their own. After a few weeks of struggling with unsatisfactory recordings, the band recalled Glover and the sessions began anew, with only six allotted days remaining. It was also during this period that the band parted ways with drummer Alan Moore, feeling that his technique was too limited for their evolving sound. Session drummer Simon Phillips was brought in to finish the sessions."]}, {"page": "Metalogy", "response": ["*Alan Moore \u2013 Drums on \"Deceiver\" and \"Tyrant\" on Disc 1"]}, {"page": "The Essential Judas Priest", "response": ["* Alan Moore: Drums (5 Disc 1; 14 Disc 2)."]}]}}
