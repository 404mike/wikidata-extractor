Rain fell during the buildup to the day's second race, leading to a mix of tyre strategies on the grid. At the start, the MG KX Momentum Racing, running on wet tyres, took a large lead from the slick shod cars around them. However, it soon became apparent that the track was not getting wetter, but was starting to dry and as the cars running slicks gained heat and confidence in the tyres, they soon caught and passed Plato and Sam Tordoff who slowly dropped down to finish outside the points. At the front, it was Turkington who once again mastered the tricky conditions to win the race from Shedden in second and Tom Onslow-Cole in an impressive third for PPCGB.com/Kraftwerk Racing. The weather would again affect the final race of the day. However this time, there was no doubt which tyres you needed to be on, after heavy rain began to fall. Matt Neal won the race after taking the lead from Nick Foster on lap three, however it was not plain sailing. On the final lap, Neal ran wide at two corners, allowing the hat-trick searching Colin Turkington to close right up onto the back bumper of Neal's Honda Civic leaving Neal a winning margin of only 0.6 seconds over Turkington. Andrew Jordan rounded out the podium in third with Shedden a distant fourth. Plato and Tordoff recovered from the poor tyre choice in race two to finish sixth and seventh respectively.", "The MG drivers converted their front row lock-out into first and second in the race, Plato leading home Sam Tordoff. The race was interrupted by a safety car period early on after a collision at the end of the first lap between Andy Neate, Nick Foster and Will Bratt. Race two saw Plato claim his 80th BTCC victory in another safety car interrupted race, championship leader Andrew Jordan on soft tyres finished a close 2nd after starting 6th. Jordan briefly held the lead before Plato fought back and retook the place, Aron Smith meanwhile closed in on both of them to finish third. Matt Neal was on pole for race three but he was quickly passed by Colin Turkington who started second. Turkington led until the race restarted after a one\u2013lap safety car period to recover debris on the circuit when Gordon Shedden and Aron Smith got past. Turkington's race ended on lap 21 when he spun at Copse and broke the rear suspension on his BMW.
