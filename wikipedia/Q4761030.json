They did not invite the author Fay Weldon, who spoke out against burning books, but did invite Shabbir Akhtar, a Cambridge philosophy graduate who called for \"a negotiated compromise\" which \"would protect Muslim sensibilities against gratuitous provocation\".

Although the British Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher gave Rushdie round-the-clock police protection, many politicians on both sides were hostile to the author. British Labour MP Keith Vaz led a march through Leicester shortly after he was elected in 1989 calling for the book to be banned, while the Conservative politician Norman Tebbit, the party's former chairman, called Rushdie an \"outstanding villain\" whose \"public life has been a record of despicable acts of betrayal of his upbringing, religion, adopted home and nationality\".No Such Thing as Society, Andy McSmith, Constable 2011, page 96 "]}, {"page": "Barbara Amiel", "response": ["Amiel's journalism became known, according to Andy McSmith in 2007, for her  \"ferocious\" defence of Israel and as an opponent of the BBC.

Three days later after negotiations the paper published a response by Ed Miliband describing his father's life, and saying the Daily Mail article was character assassination. At the same time as publishing this response, the newspaper reiterated its assertion and published an editorial refusing to apologise. The Labour leader's office responded that Miliband \"wanted the Daily Mail to treat his late father's reputation fairly. Rather than acknowledge it has smeared his father, the newspaper has repeated its original claim. This simply diminishes the Daily Mail further. It will be for people to judge whether this newspaper's treatment of a war veteran, Jewish refugee from the Nazis and distinguished academic reflects the values and decency we should all expect in our political debate.\" Ed Miliband's response gained support from across the political spectrum, and was endorsed by the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron.
