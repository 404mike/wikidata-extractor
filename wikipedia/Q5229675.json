Pollitt made his Football League debut in the 1\u20130 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town on 26 September 1992 and made five league appearances for the club, one of which came against his parent club Bury, before relinquishing his place to the returning Bowling. Pollitt however remained on loan at Sincil Bank and at the end of the second month, Lincoln officially took over the remainder of Pollitt's Bury contract. Following a brief sojourn to appear a further time for Altrincham in the 2\u20130 home victory over Welling United on 19 December 1992, he managed to displace Bowling from the Lincoln side over the Christmas fixtures and a series of impressive displays saw him rewarded with a new two-year contract in March 1993. He began the 1993\u20131994 season as the Imps first-choice goalkeeper before briefly losing his place to John Burridge over the Christmas and New Year fixtures and permanently following the signing of Andy Leaning in March 1994. In the summer, one of the first acts of newly appointed Lincoln manager Sam Ellis was to transfer list Pollitt and Dave Ridings and Pollitt soon agreed a move to Darlington."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Football Conference", "response": ["|= ||align=left| Dave Ridings ||align=left| Leigh RMI ||13||0||0||1||14"]}, {"page": "Ridings (surname)", "response": ["*Dave Ridings (born 1970), English football midfielder"]}]}}
