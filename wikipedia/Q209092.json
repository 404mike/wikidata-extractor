Preparing to rape and kill her, the Fingermen are dispatched by V, a cloaked anarchist wearing a mask, who later remotely detonates explosives at the Palace of Westminster before bringing Evey to his contraband-filled underground lair, the \"Shadow Gallery.\" Evey tells V her life story, which reveals her own past and England's recent history. During a dispute over Poland in the late 1980s, the Soviet Union and the United States, under the presidency of Ted Kennedy, entered a global nuclear war which left continental Europe and Africa uninhabitable. Although Britain itself was not bombed due to the Labour government's decision to remove American nuclear missiles, it faced environmental devastation and famine due to the nuclear winter. After a period of lawlessness in which Evey's mother died, the remaining corporations and fascist groups took over England and formed a new totalitarian government, Norsefire. Evey's father, a former socialist, was arrested by the regime.", "Meanwhile, Eric Finch, a veteran detective in charge of the regular police force (\"The Nose\"), begins investigating V's terrorist activities. Finch often communicates with the other top government officials, collectively known as \"The Head.\" These individuals include Derek Almond, who supervises the Finger, and Adam Susan, the reclusive Leader of Norsefire, who obsessively oversees the government's Fate computer system. Finch's case thickens when V kidnaps Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality, and drives him into a mental breakdown by forcing him to relive his actions as the commander of a \"resettlement\" camp near Larkhill with his treasured doll collection as inmates. Evey agrees to help V with his next assassination by disguising herself as a child prostitute to infiltrate the home of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a paedophile priest, whom V forces to commit suicide by eating a poisoned communion wafer. He prepares to murder Dr. Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch. Finch suddenly discovers the connection among V's three targets: they all used to work at Larkhill. That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge. Surridge leaves a diary revealing that V\u2014a former inmate and victim of Surridge's cruel medical experiments\u2014destroyed and fled the camp and is now eliminating the camp's former officers for what they did.

Stunned, Evey learns that her supposed imprisonment is a hoax constructed by V so that she could experience an ordeal similar to the one that shaped him at Larkhill. He reveals that Valerie was a real Larkhill prisoner who died in the cell next to his and that the letter is not a fake. Evey forgives V, who has hacked into the government's Fate computer system and started emotionally manipulating Adam Susan with mind games. Consequently, Susan, who has formed a bizarre romantic attachment to the computer, begins to descend into madness.", "The following 5 November (1998), V blows up the Post Office Tower and Jordan Tower, killing \"the Ear\" leader Brian Etheridge, in addition to effectively shutting down three government agencies: the Eye, the Ear, and the Mouth.

V notes to Evey that he has not yet achieved what he calls the \"Land of Do-as-You-Please,\" meaning a functional anarchistic society, and considers the current chaotic situation an interim period of \"Land of Take-What-You-Want.\" Finch has been mysteriously absent, and his young assistant, Dominic Stone, one day realises that V has been influencing the Fate computer all along, which explained V's consistent foresight. All the while, Finch has been traveling to the abandoned site of Larkhill, where he takes LSD to conjure up memories of his own devastating past and to put his mind in the role of a prisoner of Larkhill, like V, to help give him an intuitive understanding of V's experiences. Returning to London, Finch suddenly deduces that V's lair is inside the abandoned Victoria Station, which he enters.", "V takes Finch by surprise, resulting in a scuffle that sees Finch shoot V, and V wounds Finch with a knife. V claims that he cannot be killed since he is only an idea and that \"ideas are bulletproof\"; regardless, V is indeed mortally wounded and returns to the Shadow Gallery deeper within, dying in Evey's arms. Evey considers unmasking V but decides not to, realizing that V is not an identity but a symbol. She then assumes V's identity, donning one of his spare costumes. Finch sees the large amount of blood that V has left in his wake and deduces that he has mortally wounded V. Occurring concurrently to this, Creedy has been pressuring Susan to appear in public, hoping to leave him exposed. Sure enough, as Susan stops to shake hands with Rose during a parade, she shoots him in the head in vengeance for the death of her husband and the life she has had to lead since then.

Lives of your own, or a return to chains\", whereupon a general insurrection begins. Evey destroys 10 Downing Street by blowing up an Underground train containing V's body, in the style of an explosive Viking funeral.

The film used some elements from Garth Ennis' \"Dangerous Habits\" story arc (issues No. 41\u201346) and others\u2014such as the inclusion of Papa Midnite\u2014from the \"Original Sins\" trade paperback. The film changed several aspects of the source material, however, including a number of cosmetic changes to the lead character, e.g., his name is spoken as \"constan-teen\", and Reeves played the role with his natural accent and hair colour, as well as the film basing him in Los Angeles (although the director pointed out that the comic book was not exclusively set in London either). Other differences to the comic were made, for example giving him a psychic ability to see \"half breeds\" as they truly are\u2014a curse that caused him to attempt suicide which in turn damned him to Hell. He was also given the ability to render invisible beings in his proximity visible by using the incantation \"Into the light I command thee\" and two magical glyphs (called \"The Perfect Red King\" from Eugenius Philalethes's \"The Speculum Veritatis\") on his arms to combine, which he uses to uncloak the archangel Gabriel directly after he attacked his friend Chas. Unlike the comic version, Constantine's exorcism tools are primarily based on Christian relics rather than generic supernatural items; the novelisation expanded on this by explaining that, as Constantine comes from a Christian culture, he has a greater natural understanding of the power of Christian relics that makes it easier for him to use them. Constantine's exorcisms are motivated by a desire to redeem himself for his past suicide, yet they are constantly doomed to fail as everything he has done has fundamentally been for his own benefit rather than for the selfless betterment of others. The resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was also amended, with Lucifer saving the redeemed Constantine to give him a second chance at failing after Constantine willingly sacrificed a chance to save his own life to ask Satan to send the innocent Isabel Dodson to Heaven (Isabel having committed suicide to prevent herself being used as a host for a demonic incursion).

Along the way, he solves supernatural mysteries, vanquishes demons, and clashes with officious angels sent to watch over him. Despite a positive reaction from fans, poor ratings led to the show not being renewed.

He informs her that the Book of Magick she's looking for, which used to be in her father's possession, was stolen from him by a group of occultists just like the one they encountered, the Church of Blood. Zatanna says that the acolyte she fought with was already very powerful and John says that they must be planning something big. John also says that he wants the book because he intends to sell it to collectors but Zatanna says that the book belonged to her father, from which he got all his spells, so she won't let him have it. She reveals to him that she needs to find the Book of Magick and destroy it like she did with all the other items he had cursed. Constantine then says that she can't battle with all these men from the cult on her own and that she needs help to do so. The two form an uneasy partnership, even though they still disagree about who will take the book in the end. John faces Brother Blood and his cult. Following an abduction of a teenage girl by the cult, Zatanna and John Constantine are closing in on the Church of Blood, who is preparing a final sacrifice at Stonehenge to bring the demon Trigon to Earth. They arrive moments before the cult appears ready to kill the girl. Just as Brother Blood, the leader, raises his ceremonial dagger, John and Zatanna descend from the sky. They succeed in preventing the girl's sacrifice while Constantine attacks the cult members but suddenly Brother Blood reveals that he was the true sacrifice all along and then stabs himself in the heart. While demons claw their way out of Brother Blood's body, Constantine grabs the Book of Magick and makes off with it, abandoning Zatanna and the girl to deal with the demons on their own. With no other options, the two run from the attacking demons. Constantine retreats to a nearby truck as Zatanna is left alone with the girl at Stonehenge to face the demons. The ghosts of those he's let die in the past watch him accusingly, but he insists he doesn't care about leaving her and the girl behind. Constantine eventually has a change of heart and hurries back to Brother Blood's body. He reaches inside the slain man's opened chest to extract one of his organs. Then he recites an exorcism spell that banishes the demons back to the pits of Hell from whence they came, saving both their lives. Later, Zatanna meets Constantine at one of the bars and her thanks to him for not letting her die. She also tells him that she considers D.E.O.'s offer to become a consultant and John says that now that she doesn't have to search for any other cursed objects of her father's she is free to do what she wants.

Peter Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party and Sutler's right-hand man, suggested releasing the virus onto Britain, albeit through water route to avoid a pandemic. Targeting St. Mary's School, a tube station and a water treatment plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people and was blamed on a terrorist organisation.

(In both stories, the hero escapes an unjust and traumatic imprisonment and spends decades preparing to take vengeance on his oppressors under a new persona.)

After the release and relative success of Road House, writer Hilary Henkin was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft \u2013 one that bears little, if any, relation to the finished product, with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel, as well as the removal of much of the novel's ambiguity, especially in regard to V's identity. The Wachowskis were fans of V for Vendetta and in the mid-1990s, before working on The Matrix, wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third The Matrix films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to James McTeigue. All three were intrigued by the original story's themes and found them to be relevant to the contemporary political landscape.

He ended cooperation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, Warner Bros., failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the film. Moore said that the script contained plot holes and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work, which was to place two political extremes (fascism and anarchism) against one another. He argues his work had been recast as a story about \"current American neoconservatism vs. current American liberalism\". Per his wishes, Moore's name does not appear in the film's closing credits. Co-creator and illustrator David Lloyd supports the film adaptation, commenting that the script is very good but that Moore would only ever be truly happy with a complete book-to-screen adaptation. In 2021, Lloyd revealed that Moore had actually wanted to make V for Vendetta into a movie around the time the comic book was originally being conceived.", "James Purefoy was originally cast as V, but dropped out after six weeks into filming.

In preparation for the role, Portman worked with dialect coach Barbara Berkery to speak in a British accent, studied films such as The Weather Underground, and read the autobiography of Menachem Begin. She received top billing for the film. Her role in the film has parallels to her role in L\u00e9on: The Professional.

The first was \"Street Fighting Man\" by the Rolling Stones. The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller's \"BKAB\". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from \"On Black Power\" (also in \"A Declaration of Independence\") by black nationalist leader Malcolm X, and from \"Address to the Women of America\" by feminist writer Gloria Steinem were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: \"This is no simple reform ... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends.\" The final song was \"Out of Sight\" by Spiritualized.", "Also in the film were segments from two of Antonio Carlos Jobim's classic bossa nova songs, \"The Girl From Ipanema\" and \"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\". These songs were played during the \"breakfast scenes\" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together. Beethoven's Symphony No.5 also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the first movement signifying the letter \"V\" in Morse code. Gordon Deitrich's Benny Hill-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the \"Yakety Sax\" theme. Inspector Finch's alarm clock begins the morning of 4 November with the song \"Long Black Train\" by Richard Hawley, which contains the foreshadowing lyrics \"Ride the long black train ... take me home black train.\"", "The film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel V for Vendetta; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology Warrior, and then reprinted and completed by DC.
