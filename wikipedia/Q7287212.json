Goals at a premium, Ernest Beckett (8), and Jim Mason (6) were the only players to score with anything approaching regularity. Highly impressive goalkeeper Tom Baddeley was an ever-present for the second successive season, with left-back George Youds and centre-half Ralph Barlow missing just one match each. At the end of the season Baddeley and Eccles left for Wolves, Eardley and McDonald left for Stoke; all wishing to remain Football League players.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Ralph Barlow", "|11||MF||||Ralph Barlow||1||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Having failed a vote to stay in the Football League, Burslem Port Vale successfully re-applied for membership of the Midland League. They started positively with a 4\u20131 home win over Wellingborough Town, though only 200 spectators turned up to the Athletic Ground. Bad news followed as centre-half Ralph Barlow suffered a breakdown and was sent to a convalescent home. The team then lost home and away to Glossop North End, with Danny Simpson being sent off in the home fixture for making an \"objectionable remark\" to the referee. A 1\u20130 defeat at Worksop was followed by a 5\u20132 win over a strong Doncaster Rovers side. Wellingborough Town then took their revenge with a 3\u20132 win in Wellingborough. Feeling the need to raise funds, Vale sold goalkeeper Tom Baddeley to Wolverhampton Wanderers for \u00a350. The financial boost was needed as a 3\u20131 home win over Barnsley St Peter's on 7 November saw just 100 spectators, raising gross takings of \u00a35 for a match-day loss of around \u00a38. In Baddeley's absence Vale conceded six in a home defeat to Rushden and \"the disgust of the spectators was general\". A public meeting was held on 14 December to debate the club's future, if any; the outlook seemed extremely bleak as a poorly attended meeting heard that the club had a debt of \u00a3110 and the current committee were unwilling to continue funding the club.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"|Ralph Barlow", "| Summer 1897 || DF ||  || Ralph Barlow ||  || Released || "]}]}}
