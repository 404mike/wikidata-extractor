Cardiff were charging \u00a32.50 to Cardiff fans and those who bought tickets in advance but \u00a33 to Wednesday fans.He was the chairman of the club at the time of the Hillsborough disaster.He resigned from his position as Chairman soon after and was replaced by Dave Richards.\nHe was appointed an OBE in 1991 for services to Sheffield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hillsborough disaster", "response": ["Hillsborough hosted five FA Cup semi-finals in the 1980s. A crush occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the ground during the 1981 semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated, resulting in 38 injuries, including broken arms, legs and ribs. Police believed there had been a real chance of fatalities had swift action not been taken, and recommended the club reduce its capacity. In a post-match briefing to discuss the incident, Sheffield Wednesday chairman Bert McGee remarked: \"Bollocks\u2014no one would have been killed\".Statement of Witness. Assistant Chief Constable Robert Goslin 14 August 1990. The incident nonetheless prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end, dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement. This 1981 change and other later changes to the stadium invalidated the stadium's safety certificate. The safety certificate was never renewed and the stated capacity of the stadium was never changed. The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1984, and a crush barrier near the access tunnel was removed in 1986 to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure."]}]}}
