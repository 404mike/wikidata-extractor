Their first campaign in the Conference Premier ended with defeat in the play-offs to York City, despite finishing the season in second place with the highest goals scored tally. The next season saw the club again placed as favourites for promotion, though no team in the division could even come close to overtaking runaway leaders Crawley Town as champions. The failure to win automatic promotion saw manager Richard Money leave the club by mutual consent towards the end of the season, where he was replaced by assistant manager Gary Brabin. The season also saw a large turnaround in playing staff, not least in the departures of the 2009\u201310 season's top scorers Tom Craddock and Kevin Gallen, sold and loaned respectively to clubs in the league above, and the retirement of club captain Kevin Nicholls. The club's transfer policy, previously focused on signing experienced ex-league players like Mark Tyler, Adam Newton and Alan White, instead shifted to buying younger players who had spent the vast majority of their career in non-league football, such as Andy Drury, Charlie Henry, Alex Lawless, Amari Morgan-Smith, Jason Walker, and Robbie Willmott.", "Luton recorded a 5\u20131 victory over Southport on 20 August, with goals coming from Adam Watkins, Will Antwi, Amari Morgan-Smith, Robbie Willmott and Danny Crow.

Luton went a goal down for the third time in as many games, but secured a 1\u20131 draw when Will Antwi headed in late on.", "Transfer deadline day, 31 August, saw Luton reject a bid from Forest Green for winger Robbie Willmott. Later that evening, Luton signed two strikers; Trinidad and Tobago international Collin Samuel as a free agent on a one year-contract, and Hereford United's Stuart Fleetwood on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee.", "October began with Luton getting back to winning ways, claiming a 5\u20131 home victory over Barrow. Despite going a goal down within two minutes, two goals from Robbie Willmott, one from Adam Watkins, a first Luton goal from winger James Dance, and one from top scorer Amari Morgan-Smith secured the win, pushing the club into sixth place in the table. A week later, Luton won their second away game of the season with a 2\u20131 victory at Kidderminster Harriers, winger Robbie Willmott scoring two goals for the second game in succession. Defenders Shane Blackett and George Pilkington made their first appearances of the season as they returned from long-term injuries. On 11 October, Luton drew 2\u20132 away to Ebbsfleet United, conceding two late goals after strikes from Morgan-Smith and Dance had initially put them in control. Four days later Luton beat fellow promotion-hopefuls Gateshead 5\u20131 at Kenilworth Road. Two goals apiece from Jake Howells and Jamie Hand, and one from Aaron O'Connor, pushed the club into third in the table.", "The first game of Buckle's tenure on 9 April ended the team's poor run of form, as Luton notched up a comfortable 4\u20132 win over Hayes & Yeading United. Stuart Fleetwood scored twice, having been placed into his preferred role as a striker, rather than a winger as he often had under Gary Brabin's management. Andre Gray scored his fourth goal in his first four games, setting a Luton Town record in the process. A 0\u20130 draw with Alfreton Town on 14 April was followed by a 3\u20130 victory over Ebbsfleet United three days later, Fleetwood scoring twice again, and Craig McAllister scoring his first goal of the season. A vital game against fellow play-off candidates Kidderminster Harriers on 21 April went in Luton's favour, as a second-half Robbie Willmott goal secured a 1\u20130 win in front of Kenilworth Road's then-biggest crowd of the season. The result left Luton needing two points from their last two games to ensure a play-off place. This task went down to the final game of the league season after Luton could only manage a 0\u20130 draw with Gateshead in their game-in-hand on 24 April. A win or draw away to free-scoring champions Fleetwood Town would be enough to secure fifth place for the team, while a loss coupled with a Kidderminster win in their own game would see the Harriers take fifth instead. An early own goal and an Andre Gray strike were enough to see Luton win 2\u20130 at Fleetwood, their fifth clean sheet in a row, meaning they would face second-placed Wrexham in the play-off semi-final.", "On 7 June, the club announced that Keith Keane, who had made his Luton debut in 2003 and played in 284 games across four different leagues, was to join League One side Preston North End on a free transfer once his contract ended on 1 July.

County were decisively beaten 5\u20130 and dropped to 3rd in the table as a result. The next match at home to Wrexham ended in a 1\u20131 draw, which was enough to put Wrexham top of the table, with County staying 3rd, one point behind. County rose to 2nd in the table following the 4\u20132 away win at Lincoln City, with d\u00e9butant Robbie Willmott scoring a brace. With momentum in their favour County were desperate to get the home match with bottom-placed Barrow on, but the Rodney Parade pitch was under several feet of snow on the morning of 19 January. Over 120 fans helped to clear the pitch but County went on to lose 2\u20130. Following that setback, Newport then went on a seven-match unbeaten run, including completing the double over Mansfield Town and Hereford United in the process. The Hereford match being particularly notable for the award of three penalties to Hereford, two of which were scored. In the following match a 90th-minute winner for Kidderminster Harriers resulted in them being the only team to complete double victories over County and move into top place in the table as a result.

The Gateshead match was played at Boston United's York Street ground with the match having been postponed on four previous occasions. A further 0\u20130 draw was played out with Dartford just two days later. Newport got back to winning ways with their second victory over Nuneaton Town two days after that. Following a 0\u20130 away draw with Cambridge United a place in the play-offs was secured with a 1\u20130 home victory over Braintree Town which also represented the seventh double of the season. Newport finished their home season with victories over Macclesfield Town and Alfreton Town, the latter of which was played in torrential rain with large pools of standing water. The penultimate game of the season was a 2\u20132 away draw with Luton Town with the final game against fellow play-off contenders Grimsby Town. County manager Justin Edinburgh fielded a much-changed side, resting many first-team players ahead of the play-off matches.
