He achieved commercial success and critical acclaim in the 1980s and 1990s as the co-founder, lead singer and principal songwriter of the band Talk Talk. Hollis wrote or co-wrote most of Talk Talk's music\u2014including hits like \"It's My Life\" and \"Life's What You Make It\"\u2014and in later works developed an experimental, contemplative style.\nBeginning in 1981 as a synth-pop group with a New Romantic image, Talk Talk's sound became increasingly adventurous under Hollis's direction. For their third album, The Colour of Spring (1986), Talk Talk adopted an art pop sound that won critical and commercial favour; it remains their biggest commercial success. The band's final two albums, Spirit of Eden (1988) and Laughing Stock (1991), were radical departures from their early work, taking influence from jazz, folk, classical and experimental music. While they were commercial failures in their own time, these albums were retrospectively highly critically acclaimed and have come to be seen as early landmarks of post-rock music.\nAfter Talk Talk disbanded in 1991, Hollis returned to music in 1998 with a self-titled solo album, which continued the direction of Talk Talk's sound but in a more minimal, sparse, acoustic style. Following the release of his only solo album, Hollis largely retired from the recording industry.\nHollis died, aged 64, in February 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wimbledon, London", "response": ["*Mark Hollis (1955\u20132019), musician"]}, {"page": "Talk Talk", "response": ["Talk Talk were an English band formed in 1981, led by Mark Hollis (vocals, guitar, piano), Lee Harris (drums), and Paul Webb (bass).

Talk Talk achieved widespread critical success in Europe and the UK with the singles \"Life's What You Make It\" (1985) and \"Living in Another World\" (1986); in 1988, they released their fourth album Spirit of Eden, which was critically acclaimed yet failed to sell.", "Friction with the band's label, EMI, resulted in legal action and countersuing.

Though he acknowledges that his lyrics are religious, he says they are not based on a specific creed, preferring to think of them as \"humanitarian.\" \"I Believe in You\" has been described as an \"anti-heroin song.\" When asked whether the lyrics are based on personal experience, Hollis replied, \"No, not at all.
