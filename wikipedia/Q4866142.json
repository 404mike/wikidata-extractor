Among these was the use of a laser to directly measure the temperature of the bulk electrons using Thomson scattering. This technique was well known and respected in the fusion community; Artsimovich had publicly called it \"brilliant\". Artsimovich invited Bas Pease, the head of Culham, to use their devices on the Soviet reactors. At the height of the cold war, in what is still considered a major political manoeuvre on Artsimovich's part, British physicists were allowed to visit the Kurchatov Institute, the heart of the Soviet nuclear bomb effort."]}, {"page": "Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs", "response": ["* Bas Pease"]}, {"page": "Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood", "response": ["*Helen Bowen Wedgwood (1895\u20131981), married the geneticist Michael Pease, son of Edward Reynolds Pease.

This led to the development of a series of small particle accelerators that shot fuel atoms into the plasma one at a time. This turned out to be an excellent way to heat the plasma as well, and Oak Ridge had continued work on these lines using mirror reactors through the 1960s. When the Soviet results were announced, they began considering how to do the same with a tokamak. Their early calculations were not promising, but a visit by Bas Pease from the UK Culham fusion laboratory urged them to continue with this approach."]}]}}
