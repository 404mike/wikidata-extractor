Kyle Howkins and Alex Iacovitti also came in on loan. He was nominated for the EFL League Two Manager of the Month award after his team picked up ten points from their opening five fixtures in August. Mansfield fell away after this good start however and Murray was booed by supporters, though denied reports that he was considering quitting the club on 3 November, stating \"I'm not going anywhere for a long while.\" Murray resigned 11 days later, after a 4\u20130 defeat at Portsmouth left Mansfield 18th in the table.", "On 9 December 2016, Murray was appointed as manager of Boston United, who were 15th in the National League North table. Murray said that \"the possibility of it being more of a project than a job, that\u2019s what pulled me to it\". Boston went on to finish the 2016\u201317 season in 15th-place and Murray released four players in the summer. In April 2017 he told the media that he was planning to move the club's training base. He said that there was an \"unbelievable\" number of players eager to join the club, with summer signings including goalkeeper George Willis; defenders Bradley Beatson, James Clifton, Jack Cowgill, Taron Hare and Jordan Keane; midfielder Jamie McGuire; and forwards Ashley Hemmings, Pearson Mwanyongo, Kabongo Tshimanga and Tyrell Waite. He compared his team to a baby deer after a difficult start to the new season, stating that \"they\u2019re a little bit wobbly when they\u2019re born\", whilst also saying that \"[recruitment has] not been good enough and we take ultimate responsibility for that\". On 28 October 2017, Murray left his position as manager of Boston United after a run of one win in 11 games left the club in the bottom two. Upon departing York Street, he said that \"they need a shot of confidence and a centre forward, everything else is in place\"; the \"Pilgrims\" went on to finish the 2017\u201318 season in ninth-place.

He also brought in full-back James Chambers, twin brother of Adam Chambers. He also brought in a number of players on loan, including: Karl Darlow (21), Sam Mantom (20), Aaron McCarey (20), and Craig Westcarr (27). Mantom was made into a permanent signing in January. Smith signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract in October, keeping him at the club until summer 2015. This came after the club announced a \u00a310,000 profit on the previous campaign as Smith's 'Total Football' approach yielded a mid-table position for the young Walsall team, in addition to praise from pundits and fans. A poor run of results saw the team slip to just above the relegation zone in mid-December. Walsall recovered to win four of their five games in January, as Smith was named as Manager of the Month.

First through the door was Joe Oastler on loan from Queens Park Rangers. Capable of playing as both a midfielder and defender, Oastler joined Torquay on a one-month deal. Later in the month, two more loan signings arrived at Plainmoor within twenty four hours of each other. Winger Romone Rose became the second loanee from Neil Warnock's QPR, signing a three-month deal, while the young Wolves striker Ashley Hemmings joined Torquay, like Oastler, on a one-month contract.", "No new additions were made to the squad during the month, although the loan deal for Joe Oastler was extended until January while Wolves agreed to allow Ashley Hemmings to extend his stay at Plainmoor.  With the loan window about to close, leading striker Elliot Benyon appeared to be on the verge of leaving Torquay, with Swindon, Dagenham & Redbridge and Southend among the clubs reported to have been interested in making a move for the young forward.  However, Gulls fans were relieved when the window closed with Benyon still part of the United squad - at least until the January transfer window.  Of the two players placed on the transfer list in October, Kieran Charnock moved on loan to Morecambe, with a view to making the deal a permanent one in January.

Danny Senda left the Gulls after making only three appearances since joining in September, while Wayne Carlisle was released after making 76 appearances for Torquay and being a key member of the squad which gained promotion from the Conference.  Of the recent loan signings, Romone Rose was allowed to return to QPR while Ashley Hemmings had his loan deal from Wolves extended until the end of the season.", "Just two days after the huge disappointment of the Crawley game, the last day of the January transfer window finally saw the departure of top striker Elliot Benyon to Swindon.  Benyon had been one of Paul Buckle's first signings when he took over at Plainmoor in 2007, and had now developed into Torquay's main goal threat.  As such he had been tracked by several clubs over a number of months and his eventual move had been seen as inevitable by the majority of Gulls fans.  The last day of the window also saw the transfer of Nicky Wroe to Shrewsbury and the cancellation of Ashley Hemmings\u2019 loan deal with Wolves.  In their place came striker Jake Robinson and midfielder Craig Stanley on loan deals from Shrewsbury and Morecambe respectively.
