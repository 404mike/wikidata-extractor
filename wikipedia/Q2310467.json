The adaptation of the P. D. James novel was originally written by Paul Chart, and later rewritten by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. The studio brought director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n on board in 2001. Cuar\u00f3n and screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton began rewriting the script after the director completed Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. Afraid he would \"start second guessing things\", Cuar\u00f3n chose not to read P. D. James' novel, opting to have Sexton read the book while Cuar\u00f3n himself read an abridged version. Cuar\u00f3n did not immediately begin production, instead directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. During this period, David Arata rewrote the screenplay and delivered the draft which secured Clive Owen and sent the film into pre-production. The director's work experience in the United Kingdom exposed him to the \"social dynamics of the British psyche\", giving him insight into the depiction of \"British reality\". Cuar\u00f3n used the film The Battle of Algiers as a model for social reconstruction in preparation for production, presenting the film to Clive Owen as an example of his vision for Children of Men. In order to create a philosophical and social framework for the film, the director read literature by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, as well as similar works.
