In 1861 his grandson John Aynsley built the historic Portland Works on Sutherland Road, Longton, Staffordshire. The company's profitability made it a desirable acquisition. In June 1970 Spode put in a bid, this was then topped in July by Denbyware. Discussions then followed with Waterford Glass and a \u00a31 million bid was agreed. In 1970 John Aynsley and Sons was taken over by Waterford and renamed Aynsley China Ltd. In 1987 Waterford sold the company in order to focus the group's fine china sales on the worldwide Wedgwood brand.Strategic Management Cases, p625"]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*John Aynsley (1823\u20131907), founder of Aynsley China."]}, {"page": "Aynsley", "response": ["* John Aynsley, English potter"]}, {"page": "Aynsley, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Aynsley"]}]}}
