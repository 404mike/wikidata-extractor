Having been force fed more than 25 times, over a week or so, Moorhead become seriously ill with double pneumonia, and had even been given absolution by the prison chaplain. Her solicitor intervened and she was released into the care of Dr Grace Cadell, a fellow activist in the suffrage movement. Arriving at Cadell's home, 145 Leith Walk, 150 police had been awaiting a demonstration, but none arose, although a call had gone out earlier in the Dundee Courier letters page from Emily Pankhurst and Lila Clunas and in The Scotsman an advert inviting 'thousands' to march from Charlotte Square to Calton Prison, along Princes Street in protest at Moorhead's treatment (but she had already been released by the set time). Despite the many well wishers, she was so weak that she only allowed visits from Dr Mabel Jones or her Broughty Ferry friend, Enid Rennie, who had written to Dr. Devon who had been the lead prison doctor who latterly conducted the force feeding, that it was  'a permanent blot on the record of so many fights for liberty in which Scotland has hitherto born a noble part'. Elizabeth Gauld, Janie Allan and others wrote to object and his responses showed he would prefer to consider her 'mad'.  The arson at Whitekirk Church was said by Allan to be a revenge for Moorhead's treatment. Her prison force feeding experiences - duly related to the presscaused much protest at the cruelty involved. Her treatment and resultant activism was raised in Parliament, the Secretary of State asked on two occasions about the treatment and 'her life being endangered'. "]}]}}
