According to Linden, \"the whole idea was to publicise the immorality of the bomb\": the group were affiliated the national CND, and a letter was sent to General de Gaulle to protest the French test explosion. The first Catholic banner was seen on an Aldermasteron March in 1959, with 200 people: 600 associate members were part of the organisation. By 1966, Linden had become less politically active, and gone to study at the Catholic Workers' College in Oxford. In an interview with The Tablet in 2017, Linden said, \"I've been described as a Catholic atheist, but that's not right. I am a Catholic who finds it difficult to believe in God. There was a day when I used to run about with rosary beads and stuff like that, but I don't do that now.\" Meanwhile, in 1963, he co-founded the Simon Community, a charity in aid of the homeless, with Anton Wallich-Clifford, a probation officer at Bow Street Magistrates Court."]}]}}
