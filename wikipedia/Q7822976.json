The position of 129/1 had been built by Paul Terry who scored 71 and shared stands of 74 and 55 with Tony Middleton (18) and Giles White (30) respectively. They recovered from 139/6 with Shaun Udal adding 64 and Rajesh Maru scoring 32. By the close Hampshire had been dismissed, Tim Munton finishing the innings with his fourth wicket of the day and 500th of his career. Warwickshire dominated a curtailed second day, scoring 210 in three hours of play. Andy Moles was the sole wicket to fall, and that brought together left-handers Roger Twose and Brian Lara who shared an unbeaten second wicket stand of 156 in 28 overs. When play was abandoned Lara had scored 89 from 93 balls and Twose 84 from 121. The partnership was extended to 295, the highest for any Warwickshire wicket against Hampshire. Lara's score was his ninth century for the club and took him past 2,000 runs for the season. Twose's innings of 137 took five hours and contained 19 boundaries. After their dismissals the middle order looked to score quickly but rain again restricted play. Warwickshire closed with a lead of 205 and four wickets remaining. They batted on for 40 minutes into the final morning increasing the lead by 53 runs. Munton dismissed both openers before spinners Neil Smith and Richard Davis took over, taking the remaining eight wickets including a spell of five wickets in five overs. The innings victory secured the County Championship title for Warwickshire, their first since 1972."]}, {"page": "Tony Middleton", "response": ["Tony Middleton may refer to:", "*Tony Middleton (cricketer) (born 1964), former English cricketer", "*Tony Middleton (singer) (born 1934), American singer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Tony Middleton, cricketer, was born in Winchester"]}, {"page": "Fletcha Middleton", "response": ["He is the son of former Hampshire cricketer and batting coach Tony Middleton. https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/17891380.amp/"]}]}}
