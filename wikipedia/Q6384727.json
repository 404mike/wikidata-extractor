Her research there was on anti-malarial immune responses. In 1985, she joined the recently established department of clinical tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), working with Keith McAdam. Her early research at LSHTM was on immunity to leprosy, particularly the T-cell response to Mycobacterium leprae. She spent time at the Aga Khan University in Karachi where she began a long-term collaboration with the Pakistani immunologist, Rabia Hussain. The clinical presentation of leprosy shows a range of possible symptoms, and Dockrell and Hussain have investigated the way in which the body's anti-mycobacterial immune response determines what form of disease occurs. They have also researched methods to diagnose the disease."]}]}}
