White was among those who sailed with Richard Grenville in the first attempt to colonize Roanoke Island in 1585, acting as artist and mapmaker to the expedition. He would most famously briefly serve as the governor of the second attempt to found Roanoke Colony on the same island in 1587 and discover the colonists had mysteriously vanished.\nDuring his time at Roanoke Island he made several watercolor sketches of the surrounding landscape and the native Algonkin peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the Eastern seaboard; the surviving original watercolors are now preserved in the print room of the British Museum.\nIn 1587, White became governor of Sir Walter Raleigh's failed attempt at a permanent settlement on Roanoke Island, known to history as the \"Lost Colony\". This was the earliest effort to establish a permanent English colony in the New World. White's granddaughter Virginia Dare was the first English child born in the Americas.\nAfter the failure of the colony, White retired to Raleigh's estates in Ireland, reflecting upon the \"evils and unfortunate events\" which had ruined his hopes in America, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 18", "response": ["*1590 \u2013 John White, the governor of the Roanoke Colony, returns from a supply trip to England and finds his settlement deserted.", "*1587 \u2013 Virginia Dare, granddaughter of Governor John White of the Colony of Roanoke, first child born to English parents in the Americas (date of death unknown)"]}, {"page": "British Museum", "response": ["There are groups of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, (including his only surviving full-scale cartoon), D\u00fcrer (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, Claude and Watteau, and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including D\u00fcrer (99 engravings, 6 etchings and most of his 346 woodcuts), Rembrandt and Goya.
