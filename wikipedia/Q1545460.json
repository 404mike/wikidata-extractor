Prior to this, he held positions at the University of St Andrews (1955\u201356), Pennsylvania State University (1958\u201359 and 1961\u201366), the University of Leeds (1959\u201361), and the University of Chicago (1965\u201383). He is well known for his many contributions to the understanding of magmatism, particularly through his work on the experimental petrology of magmas and volatiles. In the early 1970s, Wyllie wrote two widely used textbooks; The Dynamic Earth (1971) and The Way the Earth Works (1976) which integrated the new understanding of magmatism and plate tectonics. He is also famous for his contributions to the coverage of earth sciences in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, particularly his outline of the field in Part Two of the Prop\u00e6dia. Wyllie was President of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) from 1995 to 1999.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wollaston Medal", "response": ["*1982 Peter John Wyllie"]}, {"page": "List of mineralogists", "response": ["* Peter John Wyllie (born 1930)"]}, {"page": "Prop\u00e6dia", "response": ["| rowspan=\"4\" | 2.
