After an opening stand of 102 between captain Charlotte Edwards and Laura Marsh, England only scored 31 runs in their final 7 overs to finish 133\u20136. Pakistan never really threatened to cause an upset, and were bowled out for 90 including 4-9 for Holly Colvin. However, Danielle Wyatt suffered an ankle injury whilst bowling and this limited her bowling input for the remainder of the group stage. Any unease at England's first performance was quashed with a thumping nine wicket win over India in their second game, which saw them qualify for the knockout stage. India were limited to 116-6 off their 20 overs, before another impressive stand of 78 from Edwards and Marsh ended the game as a contest, with Edwards ending on 50* and winning the player of the match award.", "Following on from the disappointment of not winning the world Twenty20, England headed to India for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, defending their 2009 title. England added Georgia Elwiss to their squad from the World Twenty20, and were in Group A with Sri Lanka, West Indies and hosts India. England's tournament got off to a disastrous start, losing a thrilling match to the unfancied Sri Lanka. Sarah Taylor, Laura Marsh and Anya Shrubsole all missed the game injured, and Sri Lanka won the toss and inserted England to bat. The toss would prove crucial many times in this tournament, as the early start times meant that batting during the first hour was extremely difficult, and so it proved in this match, with Charlotte Edwards, Danielle Wyatt and Lydia Greenway all out within the first eight overs. Arran Brindle (31) and Heather Knight (38) lead the recovery, but as soon as England had gained the ascendancy they were both dismissed. It was left to vice-captain Jenny Gunn and debutant Amy Jones to get England to a defendable score, and they did, with Gunn making 52 and Jones 41. Some late hitting from Katherine Brunt and Danielle Hazell lifted England to 238\u20138, and it seemed as though the disaster the early wickets had promised had been averted. Sri Lanka however pulled off a stunning victory, Chamari Athapaththu scoring 62, and supported by Mendis and Siriwardene, put Sri Lanka in an extremely strong position. Brunt and Elwiss struck back for England, before a brutal 56 from Eshani Lokusuriyage took Sri Lanka to within a run of victory. She was run out in the final over, but Dilani Manodara hit the final ball of the match from Elwiss for six as Sri Lanka won by just one wicket, their first every victory over England."]}]}}
