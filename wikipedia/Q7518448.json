He also played in the Football League for Huddersfield Town, Birmingham City and Oldham Athletic. Over his career he made more than 500 league appearances combined. Although primarily a left back he could also play as a left-sided central defender or occasionally in midfield. During 2012 he earned an international cap for Sealand national football team, a micronation who are not recognised by Fifa.\nFollowing retirement he returned to Norwich City as a youth team coach before managing Eastern Counties League club Mildenhall Town.

He was sent off for dissent on 19 August 1992 against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road, during the second game of the season. The 1993\u201394 Premiership season was Adams' last in the top flight; he started the season as the preferred choice at left-back before losing out to Simon Charlton. He featured in 19 out of 42 league games that season as Southampton finished 18th and narrowly avoided relegation. His final game for Southampton came in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Norwich City, immediately following which Branfoot was sacked as manager, to be replaced by Alan Ball. Adams never played under Ball and was loaned out to Stoke City in March 1994 until the end of the season. He scored three goals in ten games for the \"Potters\", but did not join the club on a permanent basis as the management staff refused to allow him to help out as a coach at the club's academy. In his five years with Southampton, Adams made a total of 174 first-team appearances, scoring seven goals."]}, {"page": "Adam Drury (footballer, born 1978)", "response": ["In the close season of 2004 Norwich signed competition for Drury in the shape of the experienced Simon Charlton from Bolton Wanderers but Charlton often ended up playing in the centre of defence with Drury retaining his place on the left. Loss of form during the 2004\u201305 Premier League season did lead to Drury being dropped for a short time and he was relieved of the captaincy (which passed to Craig Fleming) until the start of the 2006\u201307 season when he was re-instated. Towards the end of the 2004\u201305 season he found his form again and turned in an outstanding display as part of the Norwich team that beat Manchester United 2\u20130 at Carrow Road. He continued to be a key member of the Norwich squad on their return to the Championship for season 2005\u201306. Norwich manager Nigel Worthington named Drury as Norwich City captain for the 2006\u201307 season, though Worthington's successor Peter Grant awarded the captaincy to Jason Shackell at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 campaign."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 in English football", "response": ["10 May 1995 \u2013 Manchester United ensure the title race goes to the final game of the season after beating Southampton 2\u20131 at Old Trafford.

The midlanders were now managed by former United manager Ron Atkinson. They won 3\u20132 to ensure that the home side's survival remained far from certain, but more importantly they ensured that their challenge for the title remained very much alive. Blackburn had slipped up in their last two games, meaning that United had cut their lead to five points \u2013 and had a game in hand. In the next game six days later, David May scored the only goal of a 1\u20130 home win over Sheffield Wednesday to cut United's deficit behind his old club to two points with two games to go. This meant that a victory over Southampton at Old Trafford on 10 May would keep United in the title race right up to the very last game. United went down 1\u20130 in the fifth minute as the Saints scored through Simon Charlton, only for Andy Cole to equalise in the 21st minute. However, United were still being held to a 1\u20131 score well into the second half, and the championship celebrations were just minutes away from beginning in Blackburn. Then came an 80th-minute goal by Denis Irwin which won the game 2\u20131 for United and kept their title bid alive. The last game of the season, on 14 May, saw United travel to Upton Park for a clash with a West Ham United side who had just secured their safety. Blackburn, in contrast, had to travel to Anfield for a clash with Kenny Dalglish's old club Liverpool; their game undoubtedly appeared much harder on paper as Liverpool had finished fourth in the league and won the League Cup. However, the Hammers shocked United by going ahead in the 31st minute through Michael Hughes. Brian McClair did equalise in the 52nd minute, and as the game wore on United fought against the clock to score a winner, but West Ham remained resilient and after two late blunders by Andy Cole, the game ended 1\u20131 and United lost the title, which went to Blackburn in spite of their 2\u20131 defeat at Liverpool."]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Charlton||||DF||29 (1)||0||2||0||0||0||2||0||33 (1)||0"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Charlton||||DF||1 (2)||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1 (2)||0"]}, {"page": "2001 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["Bolton's opponents were West Bromwich Albion and the first leg of their play-off semi-final was hosted at The Hawthorns in West Bromwich on 13 May 2001.

Ten minutes into the second half, Colin Hendry brought Roberts down and conceded a penalty which was converted by Lee Hughes to make it 2\u20130 to West Bromwich Albion.  With less than ten minutes remaining, Gu\u00f0ni Bergsson scored with a header from Bo Hansen's corner to reduce the deficit.

Bergsson opened the scoring for the home side after ten minutes, converting a free kick from Simon Charlton.
