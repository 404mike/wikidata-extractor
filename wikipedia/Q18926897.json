Frusciante wanted an album of two different types of songs: songs that were more \"English-sounding\" and melodic, and songs that were more influenced by punk rock. Frusciante's punk inspiration came from listening to music by The Damned and Discharge, among others.RHCP, Mullen 2010. p. 210 Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material. However, one punk rock-influenced song was recorded during these sessions, \"Body of Water,\" but did not make the final cut and was instead included on \"The Zephyr Song\" single. Many of the more melodic inspired songs came from Frusciante listening to The Beach Boys and The Beatles, along with doo-wop groups and their harmonies. Frusciante said he listened to Emerson, Lake & Palmer every day during the recording of By the Way. These new styles as well as Frusciante being especially prolific during this era came to alienate bassist Flea, who had wanted the band to return to its earlier funk-influenced sound. Frusciante felt the band had already thoroughly explored funk and was more interested in creating something new for the band. According to Kiedis, Flea felt his voice wasn't being heard, and there was a point where he considered leaving the band. While speaking to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, Frusciante mentioned that he listened to guitarists such as John McGeoch for his work on the Magazine's and Siouxsie and the Banshees' albums including Juju, Adrian Fisher of Sparks for Kimono My House, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column and Keith Levene of Public Image Limited. He also credits XTC singer/guitarist Andy Partridge in the 2002 issue of Total Guitar for being an influence on his guitar work for the album."]}, {"page": "Sparks (band)", "response": ["Relocating to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John's Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by their BBC Two Whistle Test performance, they placed an ad in music weekly Melody Maker (\"Wanted bass player for Sparks.  Must be beard free and exciting\") and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman \"Dinky\" Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\".", "Bj\u00f6rk talked about Kimono my House as one of the records that changed her life. \"[Sparks] were exotic [...], [they] were the most refreshing thing in my life\" when she was eight. \"I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people\". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: \"I saw Sparks play on American Bandstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled,  \"why I love the Sparks\".

The previous lineup consisting of Earle Mankey, Jim Mankey and Harley Feinstein was replaced with British musicians: Martin Gordon, Adrian Fisher and Norman \"Dinky\" Diamond joined the band to play bass, guitar and drums respectively. The group signed a record contract with Island Records and recorded Kimono My House in 1974. Although the Mael brothers had wanted Roy Wood to produce the album, he was unavailable, so Muff Winwood was hired instead. Winwood remained with the group to produce the follow-up album Propaganda later in 1974.", "The particularity of their sound, which matched pop songwriting with complex lyrics, defined the group to their UK audience. Integral to the sound was Adrian Fisher's guitar playing and Martin Gordon's sonorous Rickenbacker bass. The novel input of competent and innovative musicians constituted a successful formula which was maintained only until the tour which followed the release of 'Kimono My House', with Gordon fired before the tour and Fisher afterwards.", "English singer and Smiths frontman Morrissey has frequently cited Kimono My House as one of his favorite albums and famously wrote a letter to the NME, at the age of 15, extolling its virtues. He later told the Mael brothers that it had been a key influence on him deciding to embark upon a music career. In 2010, Morrissey included it in a list of his 13 favorite albums of all time for The Quietus. Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk has also named the album as one of her all-time favorites.  Steve Jones, guitarist and composer for the Sex Pistols, also hailed the album, recalling that in 1974, \"The first Be-Bop Deluxe album, Axe Victim, and Sparks' Kimono My House were both big albums for me and Cookie [Paul Cook]. We'd sit in his bedroom for hours listening to them\". John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers named Adrian Fisher's guitar playing on Kimono My House and its follow-up Propaganda as one of his influences for the album By the Way. The album was featured in Robert Dimery's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2020, the album was ranked at number 476 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.", "\u201cOne of the many highlights on the phenomenal Kimono My House, \"Thank God It\u2019s Not Christmas\" is the archetypal song from Sparks\u2019 Island Records era. Adrian Fisher\u2019s lead guitar and Ron Mael\u2019s piano duel insistently with a prominent string section, as Russell Mael sings an alternately wry and depressing lyric about the desire to find activities that distract oneself from a slowly disintegrating relationship. The lyrics are truly magnificent, both in their literal meaning and the way they work with the music, creating a rhythmic counter-melody that echoes Fisher\u2019s guitar line, and Muff Winwood\u2019s crystal-clear production emphasizes the song\u2019s soaring, anthemic elements; although \"Amateur Hour\" and \"This Town Ain\u2019t Big Enough for Both of Us\" were the hits and \"Here In Heaven\" is more beloved by fans, \"Thank God It\u2019s Not Christmas\" is possibly the album\u2019s highest point.\"", "*Adrian Fisher \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Adrian Fisher (maze designer) (born 1951), maze designer", "*Adrian Fisher (musician) (1952\u20132000), British musician"]}, {"page": "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", "response": ["*Adrian Fisher \u2013 solo-guitar"]}, {"page": "Propaganda (Sparks album)", "response": ["* Adrian Fisher - guitar"]}, {"page": "Amateur Hour (song)", "response": ["*Adrian Fisher - guitar"]}, {"page": "Absolutely (Boxer album)", "response": ["Absolutely was the second rock music album recorded by the band Boxer, released during 1977 on the Epic record label.
