A right-sided Winger, he made 198 league appearances in a ten-year professional career in the Football League.\nA former youth player with Manchester United, he joined Stockport County in 1975. He was signed to Port Vale for a \u00a33,000 fee in March 1977, before being sold on to Chester for a \u00a315,000 fee in December 1978. After four years with the \"Seals\", he joined non-league Bangor City for the 1982\u201383 season.

He added to his squad with youngsters Ian Osborne and Kevin Kennerley, and experienced midfielder Geoff Davies. After Cullerton suffered a cartilage injury he signed Ken Beamish for a \u00a312,000 fee from Blackburn Rovers, as well as former Wigan Athletic forward John Rogers for 'a small fee'. His team struggled with poor discipline \u2013 Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Midway through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of \u00a38,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for \u00a330,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy.

In late-March they then received a 6\u20132 beating at Wrexham and then a 4\u20130 beating from Chesterfield at Saltergate. The club suffered an injury crisis in April, with both Keith Chadwick and John Brodie having been forced to retire through injury. Relegation was avoided however with six points from the final five games. The final game of the season was against Rotherham United, who needed a six-goal win margin to gain promotion.
