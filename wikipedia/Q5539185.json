In 1862 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He practised on the Norfolk Circuit before being appointed as Registrar in Bankruptcy in Manchester in 1868.\nFrom 1877 he was involved in various local government bodies in London. He was a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works representing Paddington Vestry from 1885 to 1889, and was a Moderate Party member of the London County Council for South Paddington from 1889 to 1898.He was the Member of Parliament (MP)  for Paddington South from 1895 to 1910.  In 1897 he was knighted.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paddington South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| George Fardell", "The death of Lord Randolph Churchill led to a by-election at which the choice of Conservative candidate was the key decision. The first thought was that the constituency might prove a base for Charles Ritchie, the former President of the Local Government Board who had lost his seat in the east end in the 1892 election. However, Ritchie's role in establishing the London County Council had made him unpopular among Conservatives as the Council had become a Liberal dominated body. Instead, the executive of the Paddington South Conservative Association unanimously chose their Chairman, George Fardell, who had been a member of the Vestry, the Metropolitan Board of Works and the London County Council, and had a considerable popularity in the division (he claimed, and was not contradicted in the claim, that Lord Randolph Churchill had named him as his successor).", "On 22 June 1909, Sir George Fardell wrote to the President of the South Paddington Conservative Association to inform him he had decided not to contest the division at the next election, as he was retiring from political life. The Association immediately proceeded to choose a candidate and on 21 July the Executive decided to recommend Henry Harris, one of the constituency's representatives on the London County Council, as the new candidate. Shortly thereafter the South Paddington Liberal Association chose a locally-resident barrister, F. T. H. Henl\u00e9, as their candidate. The circumstances of the election, in which the Conservatives highlighted the tax increases of the 1909 budget, helped Harris improve on Fardell's 1906 majority. The election of December was essentially a rerun of that in January."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir George Fardell"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir George Fardell"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|George Fardell"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["| George Fardell*", "| George Fardell", "| George Fardell"]}, {"page": "Thomas George Fardell", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Fardell"]}, {"page": "List of members of the Metropolitan Board of Works", "response": ["Thomas George Fardell (1884\u20131889)"]}, {"page": "Paddington South (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["| George Fardell"]}, {"page": "Fardell, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Fardell"]}]}}
