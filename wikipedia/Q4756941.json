Welles eventually secured funding from Harry Saltzman and production officially resumed in late February with most of Keith Baxter's longer speeches and the Coronation scene in Madrid. Between March and April, Welles finished the film with filler shots, close-ups, the final rejection scene and most of Falstaff's speeches. According to Keith Baxter, Welles had stage fright and delayed all of his scenes until the very end of filming, except for scenes that included other actors. Welles was timid about shooting his love scene with Moreau, and used a double whenever possible. Other filming locations included the Chateau Calata\u00f1azor, Puerta de San Vincente, the Soria Cathedral and the city of \u00c1vila. Welles was harsh with his crew members and according to actor Andrew Faulds, \"he spoke in five different languages to them and was pretty offensivevery demanding.
