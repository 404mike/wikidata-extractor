The change led to a divorce from his first wife, the Hungarian film actress Mar\u00eda Corda, who was unable to make the transition from silent films to \"talkies\" because of her strong Hungarian accent.\nFrom 1930, Korda was active in the British film industry, and soon became one of its leading figures. He was the founder of London Films and, post-war, the owner of British Lion Films, a film distribution company. Korda produced many outstanding classics of the British film industry, including The Private Life of Henry VIII, Rembrandt, Things To Come, The Thief of Baghdad and The Third Man. In 1942, Korda became the first filmmaker to receive a knighthood.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander", "response": ["*Alexander Korda (1893\u20131956), Hungarian film director"]}, {"page": "Cinema of the United Kingdom", "response": ["The identity of the British film industry, particularly as it relates to Hollywood, has often been the subject of debate.

Posters and the main title bill the film as \"H. G. Wells' Things to Come\", with \"an Alexander Korda production\" appearing in smaller type. In fact, Wells ultimately had no control over the finished product, with the result that many scenes, although shot, were either truncated or not included in the finished film.Cooper, Nick. \"Things to Come Viewing Notes\", Network Blu-Ray, 2012, page 14 The rough-cut reputedly ran to 130 minutes; the version submitted to the British Board of Film Censors was 117m 13s; it was released as 108m 40s (later cut to 98m 06s) in the UK, and 96m 24s in the United States (see below for later versions).Cooper, Nick. \"Things to Come Viewing Notes\", Network Blu-Ray, 2012, page 18 Wells's script (or \"film treatment\") and selected production notes were published in book form in 1935 and reprinted in 1940 and 1975.

He began to make more expensive films, such as Seymour Hicks's Scrooge (1935) and Spy of Napoleon for which he hoped to gain an international market. Hagen spent \u00a3100,000 rebuilding Twickenham Studios and acquired studios in other parts of London. He also broke with his established distributors and attempted to distribute his own films. This proved a mistake, however, as the major American studios blocked his entry into their market, while his films failed to gain access to the British market.
