He played as an inside forward for Wallsend, Watford and Sheffield United. During his sole season at Watford, he finished as the club's top scorer with 14 goals in all competitions. This tally included 5 goals in a 10\u20130 FA Cup win over Bournemouth F.C. on 29 November 1913, which remains the Watford record for the most goals scored by one player in the competition.Due to financial constraints, Watford sold Ashbridge to Sheffield United for \u00a3350, with his team-mate Harry Pantling making a similar move. However, Ashbridge was not able to establish himself in United's team. He left at the end of the 1914\u201315 season, coinciding with the suspension of competitive football due to the First World War.", "link_mentions": {}}}
