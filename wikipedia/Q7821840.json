He is the author of the 2017 book The Beatles on the Roof. Barrell has also written many major features for the Sunday Times, and has contributed to The Times, The Idler, and Cornucopia magazine, among other publications. He has frequently written about celebrities, as well as people with fringe interests and beliefs such as cult members, alien abductees and battle re-enactors. He was born in Crawley in West Sussex.\nBarrell has interviewed actors such as Gillian Anderson and Johnny Depp, comedians such as Vic Reeves, Paul Whitehouse, Matt Lucas and David Walliams, artists such as Sir Peter Blake, Marc Quinn, Keith Tyson and Rolf Harris, and musicians and bands such as Jimmy Page, Dido, Joan Baez, Ronnie Wood, Andy Summers, Donovan, Anastacia, Celine Dion, Mike Oldfield, Sandie Shaw, Garbage, Dixie Chicks, the Finn Brothers, The Beautiful South, Alisha's Attic, Phil Manzanera, and Goldfrapp.Barrell has also written major features on subjects such as the Roswell UFO incident, the haunting of Gettysburg, the Ra\u00eblian religion, remote viewing, lucid dreaming, the twins festival of Twinsburg, Ohio, the re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings, the celebrity lookalike industry, live-action roleplaying, the science of kissing, The Beatles, Abbey Road Studios, David Bowie, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Lucian Freud, Charles Saatchi, Harry Houdini, and Screaming Lord Sutch.Barrell has said that he discovered the \"underexplored sexual side of Rolf Harris\" when he interviewed the entertainer in 2001.In a Sunday Times Magazine feature in 2002, Barrell said he thought a personal UFO experience in 1976 may have led to his penchant for writing about bizarre subjects and unexplained events. It is possible that the experience, he wrote, \"intensified my ability to empathise with people whom many others would dismiss as crackpots. I've been there, bought the T-shirt: I know what it's like to confess to unusual beliefs and to suffer mockery for them\u201d.For most of 2009, Barrell researched and wrote the Did You Know? page for the Sunday Times Magazine, which included investigations into urban myths, unsung heroes, and fictional characters based on real people \u2013 such as Brent Mini in the science-fiction novel VALIS by Philip K Dick, who was largely based on Brian Eno.From June 2005 to January 2006, Barrell wrote the Sunday Times Magazine column \"Born on the Same Day\", which compared and contrasted the lives of famous people with exactly the same birth date \u2013 such as Margaret Thatcher and Lenny Bruce, Sylvester Stallone and George W. Bush, Marc Bolan and Rula Lenska, and Michael Jackson and Lenny Henry.\nBarrell wrote the 2015 book Born To Drum: The Truth About The World's Greatest Drummers, and edited the 2012 book The Miracle: One Musician\u2019s Amazing Struggle For Survival by Shelly Poole, which documents the recovery of Poole's husband, the Texas guitarist Ally McErlaine, from a potentially fatal brain aneurysm. Barrell has also written extensively about photography, and provided the main text for the 2004 book Eyes Wide Open, about the annual Ian Parry photographic award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roxy Music", "response": ["In early April 2021, an image of a purported 1971 letter addressed to \"Mr B. Ferry\" circulated widely on social media. The document appeared to be a rejection note, sent to Ferry by one \"Hugh C. Smith\", an Artists & Repertoire manager at Polydor Records, in which \"Smith\"  patronisingly critiqued a demo tape that the group had submitted to the label. According to a 4 April 2021 item in the Treble e-zine, the letter was in fact an April Fool's Day prank which apparently originated from the Twitter account of former Talking Heads/Tom Tom Club drummer Chris Frantz. In May 2021, Tony Barrell, a British writer and Roxy Music fan, announced that he was the author of the letter."]}, {"page": "Urban legend", "response": ["The British writer Tony Barrell has explored urban legends in a long-running column in The Sunday Times. These include the story that Orson Welles began work on a Batman movie in the 1940s, which was to feature James Cagney as the Riddler and Marlene Dietrich as Catwoman; the persistent rumour that the rock singer Courtney Love is the granddaughter of Marlon Brando; and the idea that a famous 1970s poster of Farrah Fawcett contains a subliminal sexual message concealed in the actress's hair."]}, {"page": "Wobble board", "response": ["Official Rolf Harris wobble boards were sold commercially for a time in the 1970s but most are made by the player. Almost any large, springy and flexible sheet of material can be used as an impromptu wobble board, although some materials are markedly better than others. Harris's instrument was originally made from a type of wood composite known as hardboard (Masonite in the United States and Australia). According to an interview he gave to Tony Barrell for The Sunday Times Magazine in 2001, Harris discovered the musical properties of hardboard by chance in 1959, when he was about to paint a portrait of the conjurer Robert Harbin. Before his subject arrived, Harris prepared the background, covering a large piece of hardboard with Prussian blue oil paint mixed with turpentine. But the surface refused to dry. \"It was all sticky and nasty. He was due to arrive in about half an hour.\" In desperation, Harris propped the board over a paraffin heater. When he touched it later, it was so hot it burned his finger. \"So I propped it between the palms of my hands and shook it to cool it down. And\u00a0... I thought, 'What a marvellous sound.'\""]}, {"page": "Performance and Cocktails", "response": ["The cover photograph was taken by Scarlet Page in autumn 1998 at a football pitch under the Westway in London, and was inspired by an earlier Annie Leibovitz photograph of a couple kissing outside a prison. The British journalist Tony Barrell did extensive research in 2007 to find the female model in the foreground. In the Sunday Times on 11 November 2007, he revealed the previously unknown identity of the model as 27-year-old mother-of-two Lucy Joplin. In an interview with Barrell, Joplin explained that the \"faraway look\" in her eyes was the result of an evening consuming absinthe and opium, and that she was paid just \u00a375 in cash for the shoot. The name of the then 23-year-old male model is Kipp Burns on loan from Mannique models, King's Road."]}, {"page": "Tribute act", "response": ["In 1997, the British journalist Tony Barrell wrote a feature for The Sunday Times about the UK tribute-band scene, which mentioned bands including Pink Fraud, the Pretend Pretenders and Clouded House. In the piece, Barrell asserted that \"the main cradle of the tribute band...is Australia. Starved of big names, owing to their reluctance to put Oz on their tour itineraries, Australians were quite unembarrassed about creating home-grown versions. Then, like an airborne seed, one of these bands just happened to drift to Britain.\" The band in question was the ABBA tribute Bj\u00f6rn Again, who staged a successful publicity stunt in the early 1990s, arriving at Heathrow Airport in white one-piece outfits similar to the ones worn by ABBA on the cover of their 1976 album, Arrival. Other tribute acts such as The Beatnix (Beatles), Zeppelin Live, and The Australian Pink Floyd Show have experienced continued popularity for over a decade."]}, {"page": "The Idler (1993)", "response": ["*Tony Barrell \u2013 Journalist who also writes for The Sunday Times (UK)"]}, {"page": "Duke Erikson", "response": ["In a major feature on the band for The Sunday Times in 1998, the British journalist Tony Barrell described Erikson's persona in Garbage as \"the cool dude with the goatee and the Mr Spockish demeanour\".

During a discussion in 1996 about the interpersonal chemistry within Garbage, he deadpanned: \"We have a little room where we go and cry.\""]}, {"page": "Stranded (album)", "response": ["The gatefold cover photograph was taken by Karl Stoecker and styled by Antony Price, and shows Playboy model Marilyn Cole.
