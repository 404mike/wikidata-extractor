In it, according to the poet and critic Michael Hofmann, he made a \"complete and unexpected break with the tenets of economy, ceremony, care, melancholy and a kind of Oriental exquisiteness\" that had characterized his earlier work and began a \"loosening up\" that led his later work to \"the borderline between poetry and prose\" while bringing in \"more humour, sex, slapstick, and more of the world\". Williams credits his reading of Robert Lowell's Life Studies with the change, remarking that he was \"well into my career before I started writing about mummy and daddy and all that\". Karl Miller, who published many of Williams's poems in the London Review of Books during his tenure as editor, wrote in 1995 that his work was most admired for its \"directness, naturalness, unencumberedness\", while The London Magazine in 2014 described the poems in I Knew the Bride as \"blessed with a piercing clarity and unfailing readability."]}, {"page": "Poetry Review", "response": ["Muriel Spark led the Review dynamically from 1947 to 1949, introducing a fee to be paid to contributors, but she was ousted for her poetic radicalism and liberal views.
