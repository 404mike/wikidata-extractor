Lily was absent on-screen from 2 August 2019 to 22 September 2020, as part of her mother Stacey's temporary exit storyline.

Santer initially refrained from discussing the episode's plot, but commented that it would resolve a \"big storyline\" which would \"keep the audience (as well as the cast and crew) guessing until the very last moment.\"  Santer confirmed that Archie's killer would be revealed in the live episode, and that their identity would be kept secret until the night of broadcast, even from the cast member playing them. The EastEnders cast and crew had two weeks to rehearse the episode prior to its live transmission. The script was issued on the afternoon of 5 February 2010, written by Simon Ashdown. The first read-through took place on 8 February 2010, though producers held back the part of the script revealing Archie's true killer. Ten different possible endings were scripted and rehearsed, each showing one character confessing to the murder. The ten characters were Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), Peggy and Stacey. Santer reiterated that the actor playing the killer would only be told so thirty minutes before the broadcast. He explained that the killer \"may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square\", preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast. Brooks, who plays Archie's former lover Janine, found the secrecy difficult to work with, explaining: \"In the episodes to be shown afterwards, you're being told to look or speak a certain way, but not why.\" Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging, stating: \"They are as desperate to know who did it as the viewers.\" Actor Charlie Clements, who played Bradley Branning, announced in November 2009 that he would be leaving the soap in 2010.", "Ronnie is the most hurt about this and struggles to cope. She starts another relationship with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), leading to their engagement. However, upon realising she wants another baby, she leaves Walford for a while, selling her portion of the club to Jack, who in turn gives it to Archie.

Several cast members expressed trepidation at the prospect of the live episode. Before details of the episode's plot were confirmed, Turner hoped that she would not be involved in it, deeming herself \"awful\" at performing live, unable to even deliver speeches. Neil McDermott feared that he would lose his composure and laugh during the broadcast, while Palmer hoped that the episode would not turn into a pantomime, commenting: \"I hope we're a bit more professional than that.\" Simons stated that she was looking forward to the challenge the episode presented, though she would be happier once she had seen the script. Clements denied any apprehension, likening the performance to acting in theatre, and Nina Wadia stated that she was \"really looking forward to it\", enjoying experiences with an \"adrenaline rush.\" Once the script was released, Wadia was \"disappointed yet relieved\" to learn she did not have a speaking role, explaining: \"You want to be in it, but not to mess it up.\" She expected to feel \"uncomfortable\" during the broadcast, as the episode is set the day before her character Zainab Masood gives birth, necessitating the wearing of a body suit with a large \"baby bump\" sewn in."]}, {"page": "Casualty (series 21)", "response": ["*Neil McDermott as Ben Harold (episodes 9 and 13)"]}]}}
