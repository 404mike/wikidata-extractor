It has been described as a \"turn to a jauntier and more decorative visual language\" that was \"part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture\".

Nicolete Gray has described later Didone typefaces as depressing and unpleasant to read: \"the first modern faces designed around 1800 and 1810 are charming; neat, rational and witty. But from that time onwards nineteenth-century book types grow more and more depressing; the serifs grow longer, the ascenders and descenders grow longer, the letters crowd together; the normal mid nineteenth-century book is typographically dreary. The Victorians lost the idea of good type to read.\" Historian G. Willem Ovink has described late nineteenth-century Didone types as \"the most lifeless, regular types ever seen\". Stanley Morison of the printing equipment company Monotype, a leading supporter of the revival of \"old-style\" and transitional typefaces, wrote in 1937 of the eighteen-fifties being a time of \"batteries of bold, bad faces\" and said that \"the types cut between 1810 and 1850 represent the worst that have ever been.\""]}, {"page": "Clarendon (typeface)", "response": ["Clarendons have a bold, solid structure, similar in letter structure to the \"modern\" serif typefaces popular in the nineteenth century for body text (for instance showing an 'R' with a curled leg and ball terminals on the 'a' and 'c'), but bolder and with less contrast in stroke weight. Clarendon designs generally have a structure with bracketed serifs, which become larger as they reach the main stroke of the letter. Mitja Miklav\u010di\u010d describes the basic features of Clarendon designs (and ones labelled Ionic, often quite similar) as: \"plain and sturdy nature, strong bracketed serifs, vertical stress, large x-height, short ascenders and descenders, typeface with little contrast\" and supports Nicolete Gray's description of them as a \"cross between the roman [general-purpose body text type] and slab serif model\". Gray notes that nineteenth-century Ionic and Clarendon faces have \"a definite differentiation between the thick and the thin strokes\", unlike some other more geometric slab-serifs.", "Besley's original Clarendon design was quite compressed, unlike most later 'Clarendons' intended for display setting, which are often quite wide. One of the original target markets for Besley's Clarendon design was to act as a bold face within body text, providing a stronger emphasis than the italic type that had been used for centuries for this purpose, and in this it matches the quite condensed body text faces of the period. (The modern system of issuing typefaces in families with a companion bold of matched design did not develop until the twentieth century.) Slab serifs had already begun to be used for bold type by the 1840s, but they were often quite lumpy in design and quite poorly matched to the body text face they were intended to complement. Mosley has written that \"the Clarendon type of the Besley foundry is indeed the first type actually designed as a \u2018related bold\u2019 \u2013 that is, made to harmonize in design and align with the roman types [regular weight typefaces] it was set with...Before the launch of Clarendon type printers picked out words in slab-serifs or any other heavy type.\" However, because of the Clarendon design's strong reputation for quality, it was rapidly copied. Historian Nicolete Gray considered the earlier \"Ionic\" face from the Caslon Foundry in the same style more effective than Besley's: \"[Besley's] became the normal, but it was certainly not the first\u2026in 1842 Caslon have an upper and in 1843 a lower case with the characteristics fully developed, but of a normal width\u2026Besley's [more compressed] Clarendon is much less pleasing, it has lost emphasis and confidence, and gains only in plausibility.\""]}, {"page": "Long Wittenham", "response": ["The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary, begun around 1120, is on the site of a previous Saxon church.

His type first appeared, under the name of Antique, in an 1817 specimen. It was probably based on earlier lettering models: Justin Howes found very similar lettering printed from a woodblock on an 1810 lottery advertisement. Opinions of the design varied from Nicolete Gray's view of the slab-serif as \"the most brilliant typographical innovation of the nineteenth century\", to Hansard showing it among other \"typographic monstrosities!!!\". In recent times, Hoefler & Frere-Jones described his slab serif as lumpy: \"[it] gives the impression that its designer simply began with one letter and worked his way through the alphabet until the project was complete, never stopping to articulate the design's policies or anticipate any problems. In many ways, this design is two typefaces, its uppercase and lowercase being almost wholly unrelated.\" Both Mosley and Hoefler and Frere-Jones highlighted the perfectly circular, unstressed \"O\" as a part of the design which was abandoned in later slab-serifs, although Mosley describes it as \"more logical\" than vertical-stress designs that replaced it and felt that the type \"suffers from being a pioneer design\". Slab serifs proliferated during the nineteenth century, using alternative names including \"Egyptian\", \"Ionics\" and \"Clarendons\".", "However, there was a attracted attention from the Victoriana revival of interest in nineteenth-century typography from the 1930s onwards, with coverage of his work from Nicolete Gray and use of nineteenth-century styles by figures such as Robert Harling and John Betjeman.

Several display types at the time received exotic names: around the same time, 'Egyptian' was applied to sans- (and then slab-) serif types and 'Antique' to slab-serifs; this became increasingly common later in the century as more fanciful display faces were made. Nicolete Gray was prepared to believe that it was \"probably\" Italian in origin, however she was influenced by the French writer on printing Francis Thibaudeau, who claimed in his 1921 book La Lettre d'Imprimerie that the style appeared in France during the First French Empire (1804\u20131814/15), before its first appearance in Britain. Shields (2008) rejects Thibaudeau's claim: \"Thibaudeau seems alone...and does not credit any French foundry with this type's origination. In my investigation so far I have found no evidence of examples earlier than Caslon & Catherwood's...the first French specimen with a confirmed date is Laurent & Deberny's 1835 broadside\".
