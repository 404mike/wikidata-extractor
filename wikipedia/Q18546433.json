Before long he decided to return to Spain to work for the beleaguered Socialist government, despite himself being a lifelong Conservative, but Riding told him he must stay in England.  Hodge, who was becoming her closest disciple, acquiesced.  At this time he was working on a novel called A Year of Damage, based on his experiences with a former girlfriend, Audrey Beecham, and by the spring of 1937 it was completed.  Graves and Riding supervised its progress closely and made many suggestions for its improvement, all of which he adopted, but though both of them loved the finished book Hodge wouldn't publish it, and destroyed the manuscript.  In the second half of 1937 he used his skills as a historical researcher to help Graves with the writing of Count Belisarius, a novel set in the early Byzantine Empire; and at about the same time they worked on a historical survey of the influence of politics on literature, eventually published in Harry Kemp  and Laura Riding's book The Left Heresy in Literature and Life.  These were only the first results of a fruitful partnership between the two friends."]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Audrey Beecham (1915\u20131989), poet, teacher and historian, niece of the composer; Maurice Bowra, Warden of Wadham and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford was engaged to her"]}]}}
