The successful period began in 1973 when the club won the Texaco Cup and finished fourth in the league, qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time. In the 1974\u201375 season they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time, losing to West Ham United after a replay, and finished third in the league. By the late 1970s, Robson had built a strong side with talent in every department, introducing the Dutch pair Arnold M\u00fchren and Frans Thijssen to add flair to a team that featured British internationals including John Wark, Terry Butcher and Paul Mariner, although the Ipswich squad perhaps lacked the depth of established big clubs like Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich regularly featured in the top five of the league and in the UEFA Cup. At their peak in the 1979\u201380 season, they beat Manchester United 6\u20130 in a league game at Portman Road, a game where United goalkeeper Gary Bailey also saved three penalties. The defeat cost United two points \u2013 the margin which eventually separated them and champions Liverpool. Major success came in 1978 when Ipswich beat Arsenal at Wembley Stadium to win their only FA Cup trophy. The triumph was followed by a UEFA Cup victory in 1981 with a 5\u20134 victory over AZ Alkmaar in the two-legged final. The run to the final included a 4\u20131 win at St Etienne, captained by Michel Platini.

Almost half his international caps (61 out of 125) were earned after his 35th birthday. It was 1985 before another goalkeeper was selected for an England game, when Robson could give a debut to the Manchester United goalkeeper Gary Bailey in a relatively unimportant friendly match. Shilton was still the keeper for the qualifying campaign for the 1986 World Cup, which thus far had seen three wins from three matches and no goals conceded."]}, {"page": "Chris Turner (footballer, born 1958)", "response": ["In July 1985, Ron Atkinson signed Turner for a \u00a3275,000 fee to challenge Gary Bailey for the number one shirt at Manchester United.

Bailey was injured for most of the 1986\u201387 season, but Turner could only make it to 29 appearances as youth-team goalkeeper Gary Walsh established himself in the first-team at Old Trafford. Turner was placed on the transfer-list by new manager Alex Ferguson, but still went on to make 30 appearances in the 1987\u201388 season, before his place was taken by incoming Aberdeen goalkeeper Jim Leighton."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Case", "response": ["With Brighton, Case scored the winning goal at Anfield in the 5th round of the 1983 FA Cup, also scoring in the quarter and semi finals as the Albion reached the final for the only time to date.

Brighton's chance of glory had gone, and they were crushed 4\u20130 in the replay. They had already been relegated from the First Division in bottom place. In spite of this setback, Case remained at the Goldstone Ground for nearly two years after the Seagulls were relegated, including a further FA Cup victory over Liverpool in January 1984."]}, {"page": "Nasser Hejazi", "response": ["After the 1978 FIFA World Cup, Hejazi received an offer from Manchester United.
