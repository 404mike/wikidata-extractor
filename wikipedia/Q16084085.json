In 1939 she broke the Land's End to John o' Groats and 1,000-mile (1,600 km) records. When World War II stopped her efforts in 1941 she held every Women's Road Records Association (R.R.A.) bicycle record.

She rode the first 470 miles to Carlisle without a break, stopping to attach lights and change into wet weather clothing when it started to rain. The rain and high winds slowed her progress through the Scottish Borders. Despite this, her time was over 11 hours faster than Wilson's professional record, and just under seven hours quicker than the amateur record set by fellow Coventry native Edith Atkins the previous year. After reaching John O'Groats, Sheridan had a break for less than two hours, and then continued riding, as Hercules wanted her to set a new 1,000 mile record as well. After another two breaks and a meal of fried eggs and bacon, she completed the 1,000 miles in three days and one hour, smashing the women's record and finishing two hours and twenty minutes down on the record men's time."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["*Marguerite Wilson (1918\u20131972), English cyclist"]}, {"page": "Golden Book of Cycling", "response": ["* Marguerite Wilson \u2014 signed the book on 30 April 1947"]}]}}
