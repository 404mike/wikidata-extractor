Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs appeared in the film. The performances at London's Drury Lane theatre heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade.

The Beatles' May 1966 B-side \"Rain\", recorded during the Revolver sessions, was the first pop recording to contain reversed sounds. Together with further studio tricks such as varispeed, the song includes a droning melody that reflected the band's growing interest in non-Western musical form and lyrics conveying the division between an enlightened psychedelic outlook and conformism. Philo cites \"Rain\" as \"the birth of British psychedelic rock\" and describes Revolver as \"[the] most sustained deployment of Indian instruments, musical form and even religious philosophy\" heard in popular music up to that time. Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on Revolver, particularly with \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", as having \"opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)\". In author Shawn Levy's description, it was \"the first true drug album, not [just] a pop record with some druggy insinuations\", while musicologists Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc credit the Beatles with \"set[ting] the stage for an important subgenre of psychedelic music, that of the messianic pronouncement\"."]}, {"page": "Rubber Soul", "response": ["In another review that Richard Williams later cited as an example of the British pop press not being \"quite ready\" for the album, Melody Maker found the Beatles' new sound \"a little subdued\" and said that tracks such as \"You Won't See Me\" and \"Nowhere Man\" \"almost get monotonous \u2013 an un-Beatle-like feature if ever there was one\".Williams, Richard. \"Rubber Soul: Stretching the Boundaries\".

Turner adds that Rubber Soul \"may have perplexed the old guard of entertainment correspondents, but it was a beacon for fledgling rock critics (as they would soon be called)\".", "Music historian Bill Martin says that the release of Rubber Soul was a \"turning point\" for pop music, in that for the first time \"the album rather than the song became the basic unit of artistic production.\" In author David Howard's description, \"pop's stakes had been raised into the stratosphere\" by Rubber Soul, resulting in a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual filler tracks. The release marked the start of a period when other artists, in an attempt to emulate the Beatles' achievement, sought to create albums as works of artistic merit and with increasingly novel sounds. According to Steve Turner, by galvanising the Beatles' most ambitious rivals in Britain and America, Rubber Soul launched \"the pop equivalent of an arms race\"."]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["Author Steve Turner writes that Revolver encapsulates not only \"the spirit of the times\" but the network of progressive social and cultural thinkers in which the Beatles had recently become immersed in London. According to Reising and LeBlanc, along with \"Rain\", it marks the start of the band's body of work embracing psychedelia, which continued through Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour and the new songs recorded in 1967 for the animated film Yellow Submarine, together with their singles over those two years. The authors view Lennon and Harrison's compositions as the most overtly psychedelic and find the genre's traits evident in the album's instrumentation and soundscapes, and in its lyrical imagery. Music critic Jim DeRogatis views the LP as an early work in the psychedelic rock genre, which accompanied the emergence of counterculture ideology in the 1960s.", "Steve Turner likens the Beatles' creative approach in 1966 to that of modern jazz musicians, and recognises their channelling of Indian and Western classical, Southern soul, and electronic musical styles into their work as unprecedented in popular music. He says that, through the band's efforts to faithfully translate their LSD-inspired vision into music, \"Revolver opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)\", while the primitive means by which it was recorded (on four-track equipment) inspired the work that artists such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes and the Electric Light Orchestra were able to achieve with advances in studio technology.

The Beatles had just retired from touring after one of the most difficult periods of the band's career, which included the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy and being the target of mob violence in reaction to their unintentional snubbing of Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos. Working on Lester's film without his bandmates left Lennon feeling vulnerable; according to his wife Cynthia, he was also distraught to learn in late October that Alma Cogan, the English singer whom \"he'd earmarked to replace Aunt Mimi in his affections\", had died in London at the age of 34. In the first versions that Lennon committed to tape, in September, there was no reference to Strawberry Field.

Contemporary poet Steve Turner has also been compared with them."]}, {"page": "Astral Weeks", "response": ["According to Steve Turner, one of Van Morrison's biographers, Irish painter Cecil McCartney influenced the titling of Astral Weeks.  Morrison related how \"A friend of mine had drawings in his flat of astral projection.

Van looked at the painting and it suggested astral travelling to him.\"Rogan (2006), p. 173 The album cover photograph of Van Morrison was taken by Joel Brodsky, best known for his \"Young Lions\" photoshoot with Jim Morrison. The squared circle in the cover photo is described as portraying \"the mystic symbol of the union of opposites; the sacred marriage of heaven and earth\".", "Astral Weeks influenced future releases of other musicians such as Bono and Bruce Springsteen. Mike Ragogna with HuffPost wrote that Astral Weeks influenced Springsteen's 1973 first album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and two of the songs from his second. Steven Van Zandt, from Springsteen's E Street Band, has said: \"Astral Weeks was like a religion to us.\"Rolling Stone, issue 1065, 13 November 2008 According to writer Steve Turner, the album also became popular with travelers of the hippie trail, \"from Europe through to Kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed 'the Van Morrison'.\"Turner (1993), p. 92. In his 1975 book, Ritchie Yorke wrote \"It was almost as if Van Morrison, elusive at any time, had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand the vulgarity of music industry image-making. Later they might say that other albums were reminiscent of Astral Weeks, but they could never claim that Astral Weeks was like anything else.\"Yorke (1975), p. 49 According to Greil Marcus, Martin Scorsese said that the first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film Taxi Driver was based on Astral Weeks.Marcus (2010), p. 59"]}, {"page": "Acid rock", "response": ["When played live at dance clubs, performances were accompanied by psychedelic-themed light shows in order to replicate the visual effects of the acid experience. According to Kevin T. McEneaney, the Grateful Dead \"invented\" acid rock in front of a crowd of concertgoers in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, the date of the second Acid Test held by author Ken Kesey. Their stage performance involved the use of strobe lights to reproduce LSD's \"surrealistic fragmenting\" or \"vivid isolating of caught moments\". The Acid Test experiments subsequently launched the psychedelic subculture. Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on their 1966 album Revolver, especially with the track \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", as having \"opened the doors\" to acid rock. Former Atlantic Records executive Phillip Rauls recalls: \"I was in the music business at the time, and my very first recognition of acid rock ... was, of all people, the Beach Boys and the song 'Good Vibrations' ... That [song's theremin] sent so many musicians back to the studio to create this music on acid.\""]}, {"page": "Tupelo Honey", "response": ["Prior to the Tupelo Honey recording sessions, Morrison had recorded demo tracks in Woodstock for an upcoming country-and-western album. Some of the tracks planned for Tupelo Honey did appear on the album, but other more traditional country songs like \"The Wild Side of Life\", \"Crying Time\" and \"Banks of the Ohio\" were abandoned. Morrison decided to move from Woodstock when the lease on his house expired and the landlord wanted to move back in. He explained to Richard Williams in Melody Maker that the release of the documentary film, Woodstock, in 1970 had altered the quaint character of the community: \"Everybody and his uncle started showing up at the bus station, and that was the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be.\" In April 1971, before he began recording on the planned album, Morrison and his family moved to Marin County, California, where his wife Janet Planet had family living close by. Morrison's guitarist at the time, John Platania, told biographer Steve Turner that Morrison \"didn't want to leave, but Janet wanted to move out West. He was manipulated into going.\" The Morrisons' new home was in a rural setting situated on a hillside close to San Francisco amid redwood trees. With the move, Morrison abandoned the idea of a full country album and exchanged some of the intended material for songs he had written earlier.", "The rural setting in Marin County furnished the backdrop for the domestic bliss associated with the album, and the songs' lyrics contained harmonious references to the \"good life at home\". In an interview given to New Spotlight magazine at the time, Morrison's wife, Janet Planet referred to Morrison's dislike of socializing at this time: \"Really he is a recluse. He is quiet. We never go anywhere. We don't go to parties. We never go out. We have an incredibly quiet life and going on the road is the only excitement we have.\" Although Morrison said that the songs on the album \"had been hanging around \" and according to biographer Steve Turner they were written in Woodstock, musician Ronnie Montrose recalled that Morrison wrote one of the tunes, \"You're My Woman\", while sitting at the piano during the recording sessions in California."]}, {"page": "Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)", "response": ["In April, \"Add Some Music to Your Day\" peaked at number 64 in the US during a five-week stay.

Supporting musicians for this tour included bassist Ed Carter and keyboardist Daryl Dragon. Murry Wilson also accompanied the group for this tour.

The recording begins before the actual song with coughing and counting (pointedly cut short, as the real count being heard in the background). The counting is delivered by Harrison in a \"grim, miserly voice\", according to Beatles biographer Jonathan Gould, and contrasts with a traditional count-in before a live performance (such as in I Saw Her Standing There). Gould sees \"subtle self-mockery\" in this gesture, since it reflects how in the space of three years, the Beatles' focus had moved \"from the dance floor to the counting house\". Author Steve Turner describes \"Taxman\" as a \"smart little pop art song\" due to the references to Wilson and Heath and its drawing musical inspiration from Neil Hefti's \"Batman Theme\", from the 1966 television series Batman."]}, {"page": "Hello, Goodbye", "response": ["According to Taylor's recollection, he was visiting McCartney at his home in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the instrument and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: \"And so it went \u2013 black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye.\" Taylor later reflected: \"I've no memory at all of the tune\u00a0...

According to Paul McCartney's recollection in his 1997 authorised biography Many Years from Now, the pair collaborated on it, and the song's authorship was \"70\u201330 to John\". In what Beatles biographer Steve Turner deems an oversimplification that ignores the philosophical aspect, McCartney recalled: \"Songs have traditionally treated rain as a bad thing and what we got on to was that it's no bad thing. There's no greater feeling than the rain dripping down your back.\""]}, {"page": "And Your Bird Can Sing", "response": ["Singer Marianne Faithfull said the song was addressed to Mick Jagger and written about her, since she was Jagger's girlfriend (or \"bird\" in English slang) at the time. This interpretation was proposed by journalist Richard Simpson, and others have cited it as an example of the perceived rivalry between the Beatles and Jagger's band, the Rolling Stones. According to Beatles biographer Steve Turner, Faithfull's interpretation is incorrect, since she was not in a relationship with Jagger until later in 1966. Some writers have speculated that Lennon's lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney. According to Rolling Stone, and supported by Womack, the line \"You say you've seen seven wonders\" could be a reference to a comment McCartney made in 1964 when the Beatles were smoking cannabis with Bob Dylan in New York. Under the effects of the drug, McCartney declared that he knew the answer to the questions of existence and told Beatles roadie Mal Evans to write down any statements he made on the subject. McCartney was later dismayed to discover that, rather than the ingenious declarations he recalled, his realisations amounted to the phrase \"There are seven levels.\"", "\"And Your Bird Can Sing\" was included on the Beatles' 2012 iTunes compilation Tomorrow Never Knows, which the band's website described as a collection of \"the Beatles' most influential rock songs\".

Steve Turner credits Revolver with \"open[ing] the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)\" and says that the primitive means by which it was recorded (on four-track equipment) inspired the work that artists such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes and the Electric Light Orchestra were able to achieve with advances in studio technology.
