The company offered football apprenticeships, promising to provide full-time training in football coaching as well as work experience and a \u00a395 weekly salary, to up to 3,800 students. However, the company focused on targeting young players from youth clubs between 2009 and 2011, fraudulently obtaining around \u00a35m of public funds, used by the Skills Funding Agency to create apprenticeships for vulnerable young people. On investigation by Gwent Police and the Fraud office of the Metropolitan Police, the prosecution claimed that for every apprentice enrolled in the youth scheme, the defendants claimed funds provided by the UK government. It was also found that many students on their books did not even exist, whilst many of the youngsters that were listed lived far outside the reach of the scheme, or were doing less than four hours of study a week. Aizlewood was later banned from serving as a director of any company for six years, along with fellow ex-footballer Paul Sugrue and two others."]}, {"page": "List of professional sportspeople convicted of crimes", "response": ["|Paul Sugrue"]}, {"page": "Sugrue", "response": ["*Paul Sugrue (born 1960), British footballer"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| FW || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Paul Sugrue", "| August 1986 || FW ||  || Paul Sugrue ||  Newport County ||"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Sugrue||FW||||Coventry||||8||2||Portsmouth||March 1986||", "| FW || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Paul Sugrue"]}, {"page": "Sugrue, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Sugrue"]}]}}
