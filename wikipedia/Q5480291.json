He lived his whole life there and kept the Soho Inn. His known career was from 1773 to 1790 and he is mentioned by sources in connection with a total of 53 top-class matches (45 first-class and five single wicket). \nBooker was a left-handed batsman who was noted as a fine hitter of the ball and a very good outfielder. He mostly played for Kent teams and was rated a good single wicket player.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Nyren", "response": ["Nyren was left-handed as both batsman and bowler.Nyren, p. 56.

Lumpy Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey was, as Haygarth says, a \"given man\" on the Hambledon/Hampshire side but, in addition, the team included Earl of Winchilsea (White Conduit Club), Edward Hussey (Kent) and William Fennex (Middlesex). The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex. The other nine were usually associated with Kent: Stephen Amherst, James Aylward (though he played for Hampshire until 1779), Francis Booker, John Boorman, William Bowra, William Brazier, William Bullen, Robert Clifford and Henry Crozoer."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|Francis Booker"]}]}}
