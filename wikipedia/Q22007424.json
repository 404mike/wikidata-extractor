On 2 March 2021, Martin's side scored after a 56-pass move, a new British record at the time. At the culmination of the 2020\u201321 season, only Manchester City and Barcelona had a higher average possession percentage in Europe than Martin's MK Dons. His team also had the most touches in the opposition box in League One. Defender Zak Jules commented on Martin's style of play, stating: \"The way we play, we almost demoralise teams. We keep the ball so much that when teams do get the chance to keep possession \u2013 they\u2019ve got no legs and, within no time, we\u2019ve got the ball back and they don\u2019t see the ball again for a while.\"", "On 1 August 2021, Martin was named head coach of Swansea City, signing a three-year contract. He was appointed six days before the first game of the 2021\u201322 Championship season. He was joined by his assistants Luke Williams, Matthew Gill, and Dean Thornton. Swansea coach Alan Tate opined that Martin's \"passing style\" made him a good fit for the club. In his first interview, Martin said, \"I know the fanbase and what they expect in terms of the modern Swansea Way, that started under Roberto Mart\u00ednez and continued under Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup. We, as a coaching team, are very much aligned with that. It excites me.\""]}]}}
