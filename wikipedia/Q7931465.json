He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm leg-break bowler who played for Somerset, Leicestershire and Derbyshire during a five-year first-class career.\nClarke first played for Somerset during the 1993 Second XI Championship season, making a tenacious debut against Derbyshire batting somewhat down the order. He moved to Leicestershire for a short stint in 1995, and to Derbyshire in 1997. The 1997 season saw Derbyshire finish way down the Championship table, and Clarke was beginning to appear less and less for the first team. He continued to appear for the second team throughout 1998, but only made one appearance in 1999 before hanging up his gloves.\nClarke was a middle-order batsman and an occasional bowler, with a top score of 99. Once renowned for his flippers and googlies, Clarke relied less on his bowling as his career went on. Clarke smashed Wasim Akram for three \"4\"s in the 1998 Nat West Trophy final at Lords against Lancashire, the third of which was described as \"the shot of the innings\" by David Gower. Following his career in English county cricket he continued playing cricket in Perth, Australia winning the Cricketer of the Year award for the WA Suburban Turf Cricket Association (WASTCA) in 1996-97, 1998-99 and 2000-2001 while playing for Nollamara Cricket Club. Clarke is married and has three children; his wife is a primary school education assistant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vince Clarke", "response": ["Vincent John Martin (born 3 July 1960), known professionally as Vince Clarke, is an English synth-pop musician and songwriter. Clarke has been the main composer and musician of the band Erasure since its inception in 1985, and was previously the main songwriter of several groups, including Depeche Mode, Yazoo, and the Assembly. In Erasure he is known for his deadpan and low-key onstage demeanour, often remaining motionless over his keyboard, in sharp contrast to vocalist Andy Bell's animated and hyperactive frontman antics. ", "Erasure have recorded over 200 songs and have sold over 28 million albums worldwide. Vince Clarke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020 as a member of Depeche Mode.", "thumb|Vince Clarke in 1986", "Another band, named Composition of Sound, followed in 1980; it featured Gore and Fletcher. Clarke provided vocals until singer Dave Gahan joined the band, which was renamed Depeche Mode. At that time he adopted the stage name Vince Clarke, by which he is currently known. The band initially adopted a slick synthesised electropop sound, which produced the album Speak & Spell and the Clarke-penned singles \"Dreaming of Me\", \"New Life\", and \"Just Can't Get Enough\" in 1981.", "Clarke teamed up with Eric Radcliffe in 1983. Their idea was to collaborate with different artists on each new single, under the name The Assembly. With singer Feargal Sharkey, lead vocalist of The Undertones, they scored the top 5 UK hit \"Never Never\". Meanwhile, Clarke founded the label Reset Records with Radcliffe. During 1983 and 1984 he produced four singles, \"The Face of Dorian Gray\", \"I Just Want to Dance\", \"Claudette\", and \"Calling All Destroyers\" for his friend Robert Marlow, which were released on this label. They also produced an album, at first shelved but released in 1999, under the name The Peter Pan Effect. In 1985, another collaboration took place with Paul Quinn of Bourgie Bourgie; the result was the single \"One Day\" by Vince Clarke & Paul Quinn. However, the project never took off, and Clarke moved on to other projects.", "Clarke worked with synthpop producer Martyn Ware (of Heaven 17 and The Human League) in 1999 as The Clarke & Ware Experiment  and released the album Pretentious. The duo collaborated again in 2001 for the album Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle, which was created with \"3D music technology\" specifically designed for listening in headphones. That same year also saw the release of the Clarke-produced album Erasure's Vince Clarke, which featured The Peter Pan Effect, an album that he and Eric Radcliffe produced for his long-time friend Robert Marlow.  Clarke wrote \"Let's Get Together\" for the pop girl group Girl Authority for their second album, Road Trip. The song was originally meant to be for Depeche Mode but was never recorded by them. Clarke also co-wrote \"What Do I Want From You?\" with Freeform Five, for their album Strangest Things (2005).", " \"Nowadays, you can take the best bits from digital and analogue.  On certain projects \u2013 say, if I'm doing library music \u2013 where you need to have instant recall all the time, then it's obviously much more convenient to use the computer.  When it comes to writing a new song, though, I still like to have the old analogue gear there, too.  But, a lot of soft synths have a character of their own, too; the Moog Modular V is just crazy! I think that analogue has an inherent sound to it \u2013 it's like the old argument over vinyl versus CD.  It seems that you hear more frequencies coming from an analogue synth than you do from a software synth, but the great thing about the latter is that you can do far more complex modulation, both within the synth itself and on the keyboard.  To emulate any of those really complex modulations on an analogue\u00a0... well, you'd need a mile of cable.\"Vince Clarke interview, Computer Music magazine 136, March 2009, p. 84. \"", "As of 2009, Clarke has installed his analogue synthesisers alongside his Logic Pro-based workstation in a custom-built commercial studio called \"The Cabin\" in Maine.Vince Clarke interview, Computer Music magazine 136, March 2009, p. 82.Electric Independence: Vince Clarke & the Temple of Synth, Motherboard video interview, 2010 .
