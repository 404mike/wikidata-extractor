Initially he was opposed to agrarian unrest, arguing that negative consequences would occur if Scottish Gaels adopted the tactics of the Irish Land League and came to be seen as \"discontented and disaffected.\" Later he changed his mind and was returned as the MP for Inverness-shire for the Crofter's Party in 1885. He was returned unopposed in 1886, but opposing home rule for Ireland, he joined the Liberal Unionist Party, and lost the support of the local Highland Land League. The League backed Liberal Party candidate Donald MacGregor at the 1892 election, who unseated Fraser-Mackintosh. He was then the only Gaelic-speaking member of the Commons and became known as the 'Member for the Highlands'. One of five members of the Napier Commission, set up in 1883, to investigate the crofters' situation; he was the driving force behind the establishment of the Crofters' Commission and for promoting the use of Gaelic in Highland schools. His efforts led to the establishment of  a Free Library in Inverness in 1883."]}, {"page": "John Macleod (Sutherland MP)", "response": ["Through the 1880s, he campaigned for the Highland Land League, and was one of the founders of the Sutherland county branch of the movement.
