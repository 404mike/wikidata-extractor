At the time of Kelly's death, she was approximately 25 years old, working as a prostitute, and living in relative poverty.Unlike the other four canonical Ripper victims\u2014each of whom had been murdered outdoors and whose mutilations could have been committed within minutes\u2014Kelly was murdered within the sparsely furnished single room she rented at 13 Miller's Court, affording her murderer an extensive period of time to eviscerate and mutilate her body. Kelly's body was by far the most extensively mutilated of the canonical victims, with her mutilations taking her murderer approximately two hours to perform.", "link_mentions": {}}}
