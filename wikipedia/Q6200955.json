The first was the semi-final of the second annual Hampshire Combination Cup against local rivals Portsmouth on 5 October, which the First Division side won 6\u20130 at Fratton Park. Pompey were three up by half-time thanks to a brace for Fred Worrall and a goal by centre-forward McCarthy, before Jimmy Nichol scored twice and Worrall completed his hat-trick after the break. The performance of Septimus Rutherford was praised by reporters, who described him as \"a very dangerous winger\". The club's first non-competitive fixture of the season was a friendly match against Third Division South side Gillingham in February, which they lost 3\u20131 (Arthur Holt scored for the Saints)."]}]}}
