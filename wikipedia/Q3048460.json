Within minutes all three of his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around Spartiate continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck. Although Spartiate was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, Aquilon, which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, Minotaur. Captain Antoine Ren\u00e9 Th\u00e9venard used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral. At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a langrage shot from Spartiate struck Nelson over his blinded right eye.Warner, p. 92 The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind.James, p. 175 Nelson collapsed into the arms of Captain Edward Berry and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, he cried out \"I am killed, remember me to my wife\", and called for his chaplain, Stephen Comyn.Bradford, p. 205 The wound was immediately inspected by Vanguards surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together.Adkins, p. 31 Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson's instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on Orient to oversee the closing stages of the battle. Although Th\u00e9venard's manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under Minotaurs guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Th\u00e9venard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender.James, p. 168 With his opponent defeated, Captain Thomas Louis then took Minotaur south to join the attack on Franklin.Clowes, p. 365", "Throughout the week, Aboukir Bay was surrounded by bonfires lit by Bedouin tribesmen in celebration of the British victory.Cole, p. 110 On 5 August, Leander was despatched to Cadiz with messages for Earl St. Vincent carried by Captain Edward Berry.James, p. 182 Over the next few days the British landed all but 200 of the captured prisoners on shore under strict terms of parole, although Bonaparte later ordered them to be formed into an infantry unit and added to his army.James, p. 183  The wounded officers taken prisoner were held on board Vanguard, where Nelson regularly entertained them at dinner. Historian Joseph Allen recounts that on one occasion Nelson, whose eyesight was still suffering following his wound, offered toothpicks to an officer who had lost his teeth and then passed a snuff-box to an officer whose nose had been torn off, causing much embarrassment.Allen, p. 213 On 8 August the fleet's boats stormed Aboukir Island, which surrendered without a fight.
