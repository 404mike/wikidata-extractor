He was a right-hand opening batsman and right-arm off-spin bowler who played for Warwickshire.\nBorn in Reading, Berkshire, Croom began his cricketing career with Berkshire in 1914. Following the First World War he played three more seasons of minor counties cricket before joining Warwickshire. After single appearances in 1922 and 1923 he became a regular by the late 1920s.Between 1922 and 1939 Croom played a total of 394 first-class matches for Warwickshire, he also represented an England XI, Sir Lindsay Parkinson's XI and appeared twice for the Players against the Gentlemen.Croom scored a total of 17,692 first-class runs at an average of 31.42, passing 1,000 runs in a season for twelve consecutive years between 1928 and 1939. His most productive season came in 1931 when he scored 1,584 runs at 38.63, including six centuries. Described by Wisden as sound and stylish, Croom scored 24 first-class centuries, the highest of which was an innings of 211 against Worcestershire at Edgbaston in 1934, sharing in a first-wicket stand of 272 with Norman Kilner.Croom's off-spin bowling took 138 wickets at an average of 44.00, twice taking five wickets or more in an innings. His best figures were 6/65 against Glamorgan at Swansea in 1930. It was a good match for Croom as he scored 96 and took three further wickets.Croom held the Warwickshire partnership records for the 8th and 9th wicket, both set during the 1925 season. In May he scored 51 not out, batting at number 10, to share in a 154 run stand with George Stephens and in July he scored his maiden century as he shared in a 228 run partnership with Bob Wyatt which helped recover the Warwickshire innings from 77/7. The ninth wicket partnership with Stephens was surpassed in 2009 by Jonathan Trott and Jeetan Patel.Croom's son, Leslie, played four matches for Warwickshire in 1949.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Croom (name)", "response": ["*Alfred Croom, (1896-1947), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Albert Whittle", "response": ["Then in 1904 he suddenly made a great advance both as a batsman and as a bowler, and played in every match for Warwickshire. In 21 matches for the county, he made 812 runs at an average of 30.07. In the match against Essex at Edgbaston, batting at his customary position of No 9, he made 104, the only century of his career. The 177-run partnership for the eighth wicket he shared with Quaife was a Warwickshire record for that wicket at the time \u2013 it was overtaken in 1925 by the partnership of 228 between Alfred Croom and Bob Wyatt that remained Warwickshire's record in 2014. The Whittle-Quaife partnership is still the highest for the eighth wicket for Warwickshire in first-class matches against Essex. In addition to his runs, Whittle also made useful contributions as a bowler in 1904, taking 35 wickets at an average of 28.97, the only season in which he took more than 10 wickets. In the match against Cambridge University, he took five first-innings wickets for 64 runs, following that with three further wickets in the second innings: this was his first five-wicket haul in first-class cricket. Less than a fortnight later, he improved on those figures with his five for 28 causing a Leicestershire collapse that gave Warwickshire victory."]}, {"page": "Alec Birtwell", "response": ["He made his debut in the County Championship on 14 July 1937, facing Worcestershire at Aigburth. In a match truncated by rain, Lancashire reached 384 all out with Birtwell contributing four runs. He caught Peter Jackson off the bowling of Eddie Phillipson, and sent down seventeen wicketless overs for thirty-nine runs. Birtwell played eleven more County Championship matches that season, hitting 102 runs at 10.20 including a career best 31 as a night watchman against Kent on 11 August  He took 24 wickets at 36.62, though he had to wait for his first, Alfred Croom, until his third match. His best bowling effort, 4/78, came against Essex on 25 August."]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Alfred Croom (1922\u20131939) : A. J. W. Croom (394)"]}, {"page": "George Stephens (cricketer)", "response": ["A middle-order batsman, Stephens also acted as county captain in several matches from 1912 to 1924, and was the official captain in 1919, when Warwickshire won one match and finished last. He made only 275 runs in the season at an average of 14.47. He was a more successful batsman in 1920 when he made his first century and scored 612 runs at 43.71. His highest score was 143, made in 120 minutes, against Gloucestershire in 1923. In 1925 against Derbyshire he shared a ninth-wicket partnership of 154 with Alfred Croom which remained the county record until 2009. Warwickshire had been 154 for 8; Stephens scored 121 in 120 minutes."]}, {"page": "Jack Buckingham", "response": ["Despite this success, Buckingham did not retain his place when Smart, at the age of 44, was fit to resume in 1935, and in that season and the next he played in only a few matches. Smart retired, however, at the end of the 1936 season and Buckingham was then from the start of the 1937 season Warwickshire's regular wicketkeeper up to the Second World War. His wicketkeeping style, according to an obituary in Wisden, was \"brilliant rather than consistent\" and he was \"apt to snatch\" at the ball. But his pugnacious batting was an asset as well: \"Never a sound or orthodox player, he had plenty of strokes and hit the ball astonishingly hard for so small a man,\" Wisden's obituary noted. In 1937 he hit 109, the only century in a Warwickshire total of 518, in the match against Gloucestershire at Gloucester. In 1938, he scored 1054 runs at an average of 31.00 to finish third in the Warwickshire batting, behind Test players Bob Wyatt and Tom Dollery but ahead of established batsmen such as Alfred Croom and Reg Santall, and for much of the season he batted at No 3. The runs included two centuries, the higher of which was an innings of 137 not out against the weak Northamptonshire side. The more sensational innings, however, came in the match against Derbyshire where Warwickshire, set 311 to win the match, had slumped to 39 for five wickets when Buckingham came in to join Dollery: Buckingham scored 124 in just over 150 minutes and the pair put on a then county record sixth wicket partnership of 220, and Warwickshire won by four wickets."]}]}}
