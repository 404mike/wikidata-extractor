The temperature Stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones, 1950\u00a0\u00b0C and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200\u00a0K. As 2.574 = 43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430\u00a0\u00b0C or 5700\u00a0K (the modern value is 5778\u00a0K). This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun.
