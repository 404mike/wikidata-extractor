This took Crewe into the second tier of English football for the first time in around a century. He had also played in the 1993 Third division final at Wembley, which Crewe lost on penalties to York City. During the first division era Smith played mostly at left back for Crewe and was popular with the supporters despite never being a big star. He won the supporter's player of the year award in 2000\u201301. Smith eventually left Crewe in the summer of 2002 to join Hull City, where he scored once against Cambridge United, and a year later had two joint testimonial games (alongside fellow player Steve Macauley) at Crewe's Alexandra Stadium against Merseyside clubs Liverpool and Everton."]}, {"page": "1997 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["The referee for the match, played in front of 34,149 spectators, was Uriah Rennie from Sheffield.
