The album \u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu (What Would You Give to Be in My Place) was recorded in London during November 1975. It was produced by Neil Harrison who previously worked with Cockney Rebel and Gonzalez. The bass guitar on the album was played by Bebek, as Red\u017ei\u0107 injured his middle finger just before the recording sessions started. Nevertheless, Red\u017ei\u0107 was credited on the album, as he worked on the bass lines, and directed Bebek during the recording. The lyrics for the title track were written by Du\u0161ko Trifunovi\u0107, while the rest of the lyrics were written by Bregovi\u0107. The main album hits were \"Tako ti je, mala moja, kad ljubi Bosanac\" (\"That's How It Is, Baby, When You Kiss a Bosnian\"), \"Do\u0161ao sam da ti ka\u017eem da odlazim\" (\"I've Come to Tell You that I'm Leaving\"), \"Ne gledaj me tako i ne ljubi me vi\u0161e\" (\"Don't Look at Me like that and Kiss Me no More\") and \"Po\u017eurite, konji moji\" (\"Hurry Up, My Horses\"). The band used the time spent in studio to record an English language song \"Playing the Part\", released on promo single which was distributed to journalists. \"Playing the Part\" lyrics were written by Dave Townsend. The album was a huge commercial success, selling more than 200,000 copies. After the first 50,000 records were sold, \u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu became the first Yugoslav album to be credited as diamond record. After it was sold in more than 100,000 copies, it became the first platinum record in the history of Yugoslav record publishing, and after it sold more than 200,000 copies it was branded simply as \"2x diamond record\". After the album release the band went on a warming-up tour across Kosovo and Metohija. During the tour, injured Red\u017ei\u0107 was replaced by former Kamen na Kamen member Mustafa \"Mute\" Kurtali\u0107. The album's initial promotion was scheduled to take place on the band's New Year's 1976 concert at Belgrade Sports Hall in Belgrade, with Pop Ma\u0161ina, Buldo\u017eer and Cod as the opening bands. However, five days before New Year's, the band canceled the concert due to getting invited to perform for Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, as part of the New Year's celebration being organized for him.
