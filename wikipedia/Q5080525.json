His family had continued ties to France through the Irish Brigade. MacCarthy followed a maternal uncle into serving with royal French forces, Charles with units under \u00e9migr\u00e9 direction. He also served in the Dutch and British armies. \nMacCarthy was appointed in 1812 by the British as military governor of former French territories Senegal and Gor\u00e9e, after Napoleon was defeated in Russia and retreated with high losses. When the Napoleonic Wars ended, the United Kingdom returned these colonies to France in the Treaty of Paris in 1814, and MacCarthy was appointed governor of Sierra Leone.

In these conflicts, the Ashanti Kingdom faced off, with varying degrees of success, against the British Empire residing on the coast. The root of the conflict traces back to 1823 when Sir Charles MacCarthy, resisting all overtures by the Ashanti to negotiate, led an invading force.  The Ashanti defeated this, killed MacCarthy, took his head for a trophy and swept on to the coast. However, disease forced them back. The Ashanti were so successful in subsequent fighting that in 1826 they again moved on the coast. At first they fought very impressively in an open battle against superior numbers of British allied forces, including Denkyirans. However, the novelty of British rockets caused the Ashanti army to withdraw.Lloyd, pp. 39-53.
