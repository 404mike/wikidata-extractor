A six-time Olympian in the javelin from 1976 to 1996, she won the gold medal in 1984 for Great Britain. In 1996 she became the second track and field athlete, after discus thrower Lia Manoliu, to compete at six Olympics. She is the first Black British woman to have won an Olympic gold medal.\nSanderson also won gold medals in the javelin throw at three Commonwealth Games (1978, 1986 and 1990) and at the 1992 IAAF World Cup. She was runner-up at the 1978 European Athletics Championships, and competed in three world championships (1983, 1987, and 1997). She was AAAs National Champion ten times, UK National Champion three times. She set five Commonwealth records and ten UK national records in the javelin, as well as records at both junior and masters levels.\nDuring her career, she had an acrimonious rivalry with fellow Briton Fatima Whitbread. Sanderson has made numerous television appearances as a guest, and worked as a sports reporter for Sky News when it started broadcasting in 1989. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1985, and (CBE) in the 2004 New Year's Honours. Sanderson served as Vice-Chair of Sport England from 1999 to 2005, and in 2009 established the Tessa Sanderson Foundation and Academy, which aims to encourage young people and people with disabilities to take up sport.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maria Mutola", "response": ["Her appearance at the 2008 Olympics made her only the fourth female track and field athlete to compete at six Olympics, after Lia Manoliu (discus), Tessa Sanderson (javelin/heptathlon), and seven-time Olympian  Merlene Ottey (sprints)."]}, {"page": "Heptathlon", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Tessa Sanderson || 64.64 m || 1145 || \u2212303 || old model"]}, {"page": "List of Jamaicans", "response": ["*Tessa Sanderson, Jamaican-born former British Javelin gold medalist and Heptathlon"]}, {"page": "Through the Keyhole", "response": ["| 12 || Chris TarrantNina MyskowLord Lichfield || Tessa SandersonGeorge Melly || 19 June 1987"]}, {"page": "Surprise Surprise (British TV series)", "response": ["The show was hosted by Cilla Black, and filmed in front of a studio audience.
