The family were Catholic and working class, and led by the acid-tongued matriarch Nellie Boswell (Jean Boht) who ruled over her family with an iron fist. Early series focused on her children attempting to make enough money (in English slang, \"bread\") to support the family through various illicit means. Later series saw less emphasis on making money schemes, and more storylines focusing on the characters' love lives and marriages.", "Next door is grumpy, permanently-hungry Grandad (Kenneth Waller). The series doesn't make explicitly-clear whether he is Nellie's or Freddie's father, as he is only ever referred to and called Grandad. However, in a fleeting sequence in a series-4 episode, Freddie is arrested for stealing his rubbish cart. When the family arrive at the Police Station to collect him, Nellie refers to Freddie as Grandad's son-in-law for the only time, confirming that he is, in fact, her own father. In later series we are told Grandad's name is William Duval and Nellie refers to her maiden name of Duval. This confirms that Grandad was Nellie's father. He appeared in all seven series and was in the last episode's final scene, alongside Jean Boht. Grandad was frequently seen telling people to \"Piss off!\" and reminiscing about his childhood sweetheart Edie Matteson. However, in the spin off book \"Mrs Boswells Slice of Bread\", it is confirmed that Grandad is Nellie's father.", "| Jean Boht || Nellie Boswell || 74  || 1\u20137  || 1986\u20131991", "In 2017, it was reported that the BBC was considering reviving the series with much of the surviving cast, with Graham Bickley returning as Joey Boswell, now effectively head of the household, and Jean Boht playing the now elderly Nellie Boswell (\"Gran\"), in essence serving as a vaguely more mild-mannered version of Grandad from the original series. The series was set to revive the tale of the Boswell clan 25 years later, with several of their family's offspring born since the end of the original series, to feature as regular characters. However, the proposal was eventually dropped when the rights couldn't be settled with Carla Lane's estate, and the BBC later confirmed that they would not be proceeding with the project."]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Jean Boht: Actress."]}, {"page": "Distant Voices, Still Lives", "response": ["*Jean Boht \u2013 Aunty Nell"]}, {"page": "Carl Davis", "response": ["Davis married the British actress Jean Boht on December 28, 1970.
