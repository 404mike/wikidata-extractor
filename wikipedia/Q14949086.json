Before the launch of An L\u00e0, O'Gallagher worked on Radio nan Gaidheal's Aithris na Maidne and Aithris an Fheasgair, also on politics. O'Gallagher was the first correspondent to appear on the first night of An L\u00e0, from the Labour Party Conference in Manchester. He writes a political blog for the BBC Alba Naidheachdan website.O'Gallagher is originally from Edinburgh and learnt Gaelic at Glasgow University, where he graduated with a first class MA(Hons) degree in English and Scottish Literature, and a PhD in English Literature on the work of the writer Alasdair Gray. He remains an Honorary Research Associate of the Glasgow University Celtic Department.O'Gallagher also made a film for BBC2's E\u00f2rpa on Slovak immigrants to Glasgow, and provides occasional commentary for First Minister's Questions on Holyrood Live.\nO'Gallagher also writes poetry in Gaelic. O'Gallagher's debut collection, Beatha \u00d9r (A New Life), containing a group of ten sonnets on various subjects and a longer set of poems about Glasgow, was published by Scottish Gaelic publisher CL\u00c0R in 2013. Beatha \u00d9r, with its Gaelic-only content, contradicts the 'culture of translation' recognised as being dominant within 20th and 21st Century Scottish Gaelic poetry publications.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scottish Gaelic-speaking people", "response": ["* Niall O'Gallagher"]}, {"page": "Christopher Whyte", "response": ["Since 2006, Whyte has published a series of longer poems in the yearly anthology New Scottish Writing (Glasgow, Association for Scottish Literary Studies) with facing English translations by Niall O'Gallagher, which have met with considerable acclaim. Tom Adair wrote in The Scotsman of 'Ceum air cheum' / 'Step by step' that 'This poem alone makes the book worth twice the asking price',The Scotsman, 13 October 2007. while Colin Waters in The Scottish Review of Books found Whyte's treatment of his relationship with older poet Sorley MacLean (Somhaire MacGill-Eain (1911-1996)) a 'most memorable contribution ... Powerful emotion coupled with the skill to pull off its depiction.'", "In the late 1990s, Whyte increasingly spoke out against the pressure from magazine editors and publishers to produce his own English versions of the poems he was writing in Gaelic. He articulated his position in the polemical essay 'Against Self-Translation', the substance of a talk delivered in Reykjavik in December 2001 and published in Translation and Literature in 2002.Translation and Literature Vol. 11. Part 1 (Spring 2002) pp.64-71. This was his major contribution to one of the liveliest debates concerning Gaelic writing over the last two decades. The younger Gaelic poet Niall O'Gallagher subsequently emerged as the principal translator of Whyte's poetry into both English and Scots."]}, {"page": "An L\u00e0", "response": ["*Niall O'Gallagher (politics)"]}, {"page": "CL\u00c0R", "response": ["Tha company concentrates on Gaelic-only publications and rarely publishes English language or bilingual content.
