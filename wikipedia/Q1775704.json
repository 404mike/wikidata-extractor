Shankly, a former player at Carlisle, later went on to manage local rivals Workington (helping them finish above Carlisle for the first time) before being appointed as manager of Liverpool in 1959; over the next 15 years he would guide that club to numerous trophy successes. It is at Carlisle where he met local player Geoff Twentyman, who he would later sign as head scout at Liverpool, and lifelong friend Ivor Broadis. Broadis, who was playing for Sunderland but living and training with Carlisle, once arrived late for training and Shankly asserted that he would play by United's training rules even if he didn't play there. According to Shankly, he said to Broadis: \"What do you think you're doing? Who do you think you are?

The Citizens struggled in the 1951\u201352 season, and then went on to finish just one place above the relegation zone in the 1952\u201353 campaign. Revie was often isolated from the rest of the team due to his lack of pace. The sale of Ivor Broadis then allowed Revie to drop deeper down the field, and allowed manager Les McDowall to put Revie in what eventually proved to be a pivotal role, introducing to English football the position of deep-lying centre forward. This evolved into the so-called \"Revie Plan\", with Revie as the central figure. His role derived from the more traditional inside right position, and was based on the style of the successful Hungarian national team, and in particular N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti, who invented the role.
