After moving to London in the early 1950s, he formed a band with clarinetist Archie Semple, pianist Fred Hunt, trombonist Roy Crimmins, and drummer Lennie Hastings. The band played a version of Chicago-style dixieland jazz and was part of the traditional jazz revival in England in the 1950s. In the 1960s, Welsh's band played with Earl Hines, Red Allen, Peanuts Hucko, Pee Wee Russell, and Ruby Braff."]}, {"page": "Mick Mulligan", "response": ["Mulligan's orchestra included Roy Crimmins, Ian Christie, and Archie Semple; it rivaled Humphrey Lyttelton's in popularity on the British trad jazz circuit. While he booked excellent sidemen, Mulligan was not a top-flight musician and his own playing was often hampered by intoxication; furthermore, their recording legacy is spotty because their releases were irregular and generally for small labels. Mulligan broke up his band in 1953 but reformed it a year and a half later, continuing with the new group in 1962; Melly also sang along with this ensemble. In January 1963, the British music magazine NME reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace.  The event included Melly, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Monty Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Alex Welsh and Mulligan."]}, {"page": "Archie Semple", "response": ["He then worked with Freddy Randall during the 1953\u201354 season and then with Roy Crimmins and Alex Welsh from 1955 to 1963, becoming one of Welsh's most important sidemen. He recorded as a leader in the late 1950s and early 1960s as well, but retired due to health problems caused by heavy drinking in the middle of the decade. His influences included Edmond Hall and Pee Wee Russell."]}, {"page": "1929 in jazz", "response": ["* 2 \u2013 Roy Crimmins, English trombonist and composer (died 2014)."]}, {"page": "List of jazz arrangers", "response": ["*Roy Crimmins"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2014", "response": ["*Roy Crimmins, 85, English jazz trombonist, composer and arranger."]}, {"page": "1929 in British music", "response": ["*2 August \u2013 Roy Crimmins, trombonist and composer (died 2014)"]}, {"page": "2014 in jazz", "response": ["* 27 \u2013 Roy Crimmins, English trombonist, composer, and arranger (born 1929)."]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 2014 in jazz, Marius Neset and Trondheim Jazz Orchestra awarded Jazz Spellemannprisen; Sigbj\u00f8rn Apeland awarded Vossajazzprisen; deaths of Aage Teigen, Aaron Sachs, Acker Bilk, Al Belletto, Al Harewood, Alan Davie, Alan Lawrence Turnbull, Alice Babs, Amiri Baraka, Armando Peraza, Arthur Doyle, Benjam\u00edn Brea, Billie Rogers, Brian Lemon, Buddy DeFranco, Carlos Emilio Morales, Charlie Haden, Chris White, Edmund Percey, Frank Strazzeri, Frankie Dunlop, Franny Beecher, Fred Ho, Fred Sturm, Gerald Wilson, Giorgio Gaslini, Herb Jeffries, Horace Silver, Idris Muhammad, Jack Bruce, Jackie Cain, Jair Rodrigues, Jim Galloway, Jimmy Scott, Joe Bonner, Joe Sample, Joe Wilder, John Blake Jr., John Ore, Kathy Stobart, Kenny Drew Jr., Kenny Wheeler, King Fleming, Konstantin Orbelyan, Lionel Ferbos, Mats Rondin, Olav Dale, Paco de Luc\u00eda, Paul Horn, Pete Seeger, Petr Skoumal, Renato Sellani, Riz Ortolani, Ronnie Bedford, Ronny Jordan, Roy Campbell Jr., Roy Crimmins, Sam Ulano, Tim Hauser, Vic Ash, and Wayne Henderson.", "* 1929 in jazz, deaths of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Chris Kelly, Don Murray, and Pinetop Smith; birth of Acker Bilk, Al Dreares, Alan Dawson, Alex Welsh, Algia Mae Hinton, Art Taylor, Arthur Prysock, Ayten Alpman, Barry Harris, Benny Golson, Betty Carter, Betty Loo Taylor, Bill Evans, Bob Brookmeyer, Buster Cooper, Calvin Jones, Cecil Taylor, Charles Moffett, Charlie Persip, Chet Baker, Curtis Amy, Cy Coleman, Danny Barcelona, Dave Shepherd, Dupree Bolton, Ed Blackwell, Ed Shaughnessy, Eddie Jones, Edmund Percey, Eiji Kitamura, Elmon Wright, Francy Boland, Frankie Sakai, Fred Anderson, G.
