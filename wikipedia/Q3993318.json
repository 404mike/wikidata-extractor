The low-drives are controlled by a constant broadcast of pornography that the hi-drives are convinced will pacify them, though one hi-drive, Nat Mender (Tony Vogel), believes that the media should be used to educate the low-drives. After the accidental death of a protester during the Sex Olympics gets a massive audience response, the co-ordinator Ugo Priest (Leonard Rossiter) decides to commission a new programme. In The Live-Life Show, Nat Mender, his partner Deanie (Suzanne Neve) and their daughter Keten (Lesley Roach) are stranded on a remote Scottish island while the low-drive audience watches. Mender's former colleague, Lasar Opie (Brian Cox), feeling that \"something's got to happen\", decides to spice up the show by introducing a dangerous element to the island, and The Live-Life Show is deemed a triumph.", "The Year of the Sex Olympics met with obstruction when the 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained a copy of the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene.Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 101. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live-Life Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, and by the end of the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes.Pixley, Flashback: The Year of the Sex Olympics, passim."]}, {"page": "Omen III: The Final Conflict", "response": ["* Tony Vogel as Brother Antonio"]}, {"page": "The Odyssey (1997 miniseries)", "response": ["* Tony Vogel as Eumaeus"]}, {"page": "The New Avengers (TV series)", "response": ["| Stephen Greif, Tony Vogel, David Wood, Ronald Leigh-Hunt, Annie Lambert, John Paul, Hugh Morton"]}, {"page": "Vogel (surname)", "response": ["* Tony Vogel (1942-2015), English actor"]}, {"page": "List of The Professionals episodes", "response": ["| Julian Holloway, George Pravda, Arnold Diamond, John Nettleton, Nadim Sawalha, Tony Vogel"]}, {"page": "The Emperor's New Clothes (2001 film)", "response": ["* Tony Vogel as British sergeant"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["*Tony Vogel (Acting Diploma 1963)"]}, {"page": "A.D.
