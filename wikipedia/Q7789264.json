E. Brown, was a late-Victorian scholar, schoolmaster, poet, and theologian from the Isle of Man.\nHaving achieved a double first at Christ Church, Oxford, and election as a fellow of Oriel in April 1854, Brown served first as headmaster of the Crypt School, Gloucester, then as a young master at the fledgling Clifton College, near Bristol (influencing, among others, poet W.E. Henley at Crypt School. Writing throughout his teaching career, Brown developed a poetry corpus\u2014with Fo'c's'le Yarns (1881), The Doctor (1887), The Manx Witch (1889), and Old John (1893)\u2014of narrative poetry in Anglo-Manx, the historic dialect of English spoken on the Isle of Man that incorporates elements of Manx Gaelic. It was Brown's role in creating the verse, with scholarly use of language shaping a distinct regional poetic form\u2014featuring a fervour of patriotism and audacious and naturally pious philosophy of life unique to the islands, and interspersing pauses and irregularity of rhythm, an emotive admixture of mirth and sorrow, and a tenderness described by Quiller-Couch as rugged\u2014that earned him the appellation of \"Manx national poet.\" Retiring in 1892 to focus on writing, Brown died in 1897 (age 67), while again at the rostrum during a return visit to Clifton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Thomas Edward Brown (1830\u20131897, IoM)"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Thomas Edward Brown (1830\u20131897), Manx poet, scholar and theologian"]}, {"page": "Hall Caine", "response": ["The Caine family belonged to the Baptist Church in Myrtle Street, Liverpool, presided over by the charismatic Hugh Stowell Brown, a Manxman and brother of poet Thomas Edward Brown. Brown's public lectures and work among the poor made him a household name in Liverpool. Caine participated in the literary and debating society Brown had established. While Caine was very young he became well known and highly regarded by the people of south Liverpool. There he was in great demand as a speaker, having the ability to engage an audience from his first word. Through studying the works of the Lake School of Poets, and the best writers of the eighteenth century, Caine combined this knowledge with his own ideas of perfection, and went on to develop his level of eloquence to oratory.", "Caine travelled to Tangier, Morocco, for three weeks in March 1890, researching Muslim and Jewish life. Disregarding the advice of British consular officials Caine explored the Kasbah alone on foot at all hours of the day and night. Returning to Tangier in Spring 1891 to pick up local colour for his next novel The Scapegoat, he suffered an attack of malarial fever. Caine became the house-guest of Ion Perdicaris, who arranged Caine's nursing until he was sufficiently recovered to return to England. In July of the same year The Little Manx Nation was published. It was originally delivered in the form of three lectures on the history of the Isle of Man which were given at the Royal Institution, London on 22 and 29 January and 4 February 1891. The book is dedicated to Manx poet Thomas Edward Brown, who supplied Caine with information on Manx legends and ballads."]}, {"page": "Thomas Brown", "response": ["*Thomas Edward Brown (1830\u20131897), Manx poet, scholar, and divine"]}, {"page": "William Ernest Henley", "response": ["Henley was a pupil at the Crypt School, Gloucester, between 1861 and 1867.
