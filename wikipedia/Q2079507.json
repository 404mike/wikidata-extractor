The King disliked Fox greatly, regarding him as beyond morality and the corrupter of his own eldest son, and the late eighteenth-century movements of Christian evangelism and middle-class 'respectability' also frowned on his excesses. Fox was apparently not greatly bothered by these criticisms and kept a collection of his caricatures, which he found amusing. His friend, Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, said of him, since \"the respect of the world was not easily retrievable, he became so callous to what was said of him, as never to repress a single thought, or even temper a single expression when he was before the public.\" Particularly after 1794, Fox rarely consulted the opinions of anyone outside of his own circle of friends and supporters."]}, {"page": "John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland", "response": ["Rutland was born at Belvoir Castle, the younger son of John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland by Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle.
