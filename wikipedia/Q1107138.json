However, Frank Podmore was skeptical of his alleged ability to communicate with spirits and Joseph McCabe described Moses as a \"deliberate impostor\", suggesting his apports and all of his feats were the result of trickery.Frank Podmore. (1902). Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism. Volume 2. Methuen & Company. pp. 283-287 \"It seems reasonable to conclude that all the marvels reported at [Moses] seances were, in fact, produced by the medium's own hands: that it was he who tilted the table and produced the raps, that the scents, the seed pearls, and the Parian statuettes were brought into the room in his pockets: and that the spirit lights were, in fact, nothing more than bottles of phosphorised oil. Nor would the feats described have required any special skill on the medium's part.\"Joseph McCabe. (1920). Spiritualism: A Popular History From 1847.

The College of Psychic Studies, referencing notes belonging to William Stainton Moses, claims that the photo was taken in the early 1870s, that Lincoln had assumed the name of 'Mrs. Lindall', and that Lincoln had to be encouraged by Mumler's wife to identify her husband on the photo."]}, {"page": "Edward Maitland", "response": ["Maitland was a spiritualist.
