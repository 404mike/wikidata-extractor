In the summer of 1929, he left London and traveled by Berlin to Moscow before returning to London in October. Kenyatta was strongly influenced by his time in the Soviet Union. Back in England, he wrote three articles on the Kenyan situation for the Communist Party of Great Britain's newspapers, the Daily Worker and Sunday Worker. In these, his criticism of British imperialism was far stronger than it had been in Mu\u0129gwithania. These communist links concerned many of Kenyatta's liberal patrons. In January, Kenyatta met with Drummond Shiels, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, at the House of Commons. Kenyatta told Shiels that he was not affiliated with communist circles and was unaware of the nature of the newspaper which published his articles. Shiels advised Kenyatta to return home to promote Kikuyu involvement in the constitutional process and discourage violence and extremism."]}, {"page": "McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence", "response": ["| Drummond Shiels, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies1 August 1930"]}, {"page": "Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies", "response": ["|Drummond Shiels || 1929 || 1931 "]}, {"page": "Under-Secretary of State for India", "response": ["| Drummond Shiels"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Drummond Shiels"]}, {"page": "Second MacDonald ministry", "response": ["| Drummond Shiels", "| Drummond Shiels"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Drummond Shiels"]}, {"page": "George Mathers, 1st Baron Mathers", "response": ["Mathers was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Under-Secretary of State for India from July 1929, and transferred to same position with the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in November of that year (Drummond Shiels held both positions).

At the 9 June 1930 Permanent Mandates Commission, the British Accredited Representative, Drummond Shiels, set out the British policy to reconcile the two communities. The Permanent Mandates Commission summarized that \"From all these statements two assertions emerge, which should be emphasised: (1) that the obligations laid down by the Mandate in regard to the two sections of the population are of equal weight; (2) that the two obligations imposed on the Mandatory are in no sense irreconcilable. The Mandates Commission has no objection to raise to these two assertions, which, in its view, accurately express what it conceives to be the essence of the Mandate for Palestine and ensure its future.\" This was later quoted in the Passfield white paper, with the note that: \"His Majesty's Government are fully in accord with the sense of this pronouncement and it is a source of satisfaction to them that it has been rendered authoritative by the approval of the Council of the League of Nations.\" "]}]}}
