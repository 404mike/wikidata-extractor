Her song \"Happy Everything\", was defeated by Prima Donna singing \"Love Enough For Two\", who won the UK heat.  The voting sequence had ended in a tie, with the 14 regional juries having awarded both songs the same score. In an unrehearsed panic, host Terry Wogan called back each of the juries to cast one deciding vote for either song. Some juries simply gave their casting vote to the song that had received their higher mark. Others opted for a show of hands. In some cases, the juries contradicted the marks they had given earlier. In addition, the scoreboard was unable to keep up with this sudden death voting. In the final count, Moone lost by 8 juries to 6 and, as such, she failed to go to The Hague. A detailed check of the votes after the show confirmed that this was the correct result, despite all the on-screen confusion.\nHer first husband was Colin Davies; she married secondly, in 2004, Sir William Edward Doran Gibbons, 9th Baronet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980", "response": ["| 02 || align=\"left\" | Maggie Moone|| align=\"left\" | \"Happy Everything\" || align=\"left\" | Geoff Stephens, Don Black || 135 || 2nd", "*Maggie Moone - Happy Everything: GTO GT270."]}, {"page": "UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest", "response": ["In 1977, a strike by BBC cameramen led to the contest being blacked out on TV, although the show went ahead and the audio portion was later broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The TV programme has never been broadcast and is not listed in the BBC archives, yet it was transmitted to the various regional juries in BBC studios around the country, in order for them to cast their votes. The 1979 \"A Song For Europe\" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on Terry Wogan's radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show Nationwide, where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, Black Lace, were interviewed as guests on the show.  As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at BBC studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between Prima Donna's \"Love Enough for Two\" and Maggie Moone's \"Happy Everything\". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host Terry Wogan called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision. This became the norm in the 1980s and the artists taking part in the contest became more and more obscure and amateurish.
