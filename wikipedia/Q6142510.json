In 1975 he met his KGB handlers in Austria, telling them of LPG's movement to Cheltenham. Prime was paid \u00a3800 at this meeting. Following his resignation from GCHQ in 1976 he twice resolved to defect to the Soviet Union, but did not carry it out. At one point in 1977 he went as far as buying a ticket to Helsinki to defect, but turned back en route to the airport. He no longer listened for KGB messages and ceased to be an agent for them following his GCHQ resignation. Intelligence historian James Rusbridger wrote that he believed that Prime never stopped working for the KGB between his 1977 resignation and his 1982 arrest, due to the fact that he still had espionage equipment at the time of his arrest and that he possessed an internal GCHQ report that had been published in the weeks before his arrest."]}, {"page": "Eric Nave", "response": ["Nave co-authored a book with James Rusbridger, which was to have been published in 1988. However, the book was withdrawn after pressure from the D-Notice Committee. It was eventually published in 1991 as Betrayal at Pearl Harbor, but received a highly critical reception from the intelligence establishment. The book apparently reflects Rusbridger's views rather than those of Nave, particularly the claim that Winston Churchill deliberately did not pass on warnings about the attack on Pearl Harbor, in order to get the United States involved the war. According to British historian Peter Elphick, in a 1991 interview on Japanese television, Nave \"repudiated a large slice of what Rusbridger had written, calling it speculation\". Dufty said that the Allies had \"solved\" the JN-25 code as they knew how it worked; with five numbers, an additive book and an indicator system. But they had not \"broken\" the code by having enough code words and indicators to read a message. American military historian Stephen E. Ambrose pointed out that the claim \"makes no sense at all\", since if Churchill \"knew the attack was coming, he certainly would have wanted the United States Navy to meet and defeat it \u2013 after all, the United States would be fully into the war the moment the battle began.\""]}, {"page": "6th Operations Group", "response": ["Author James Rusbridger examined the records of the 6th Heavy Bomber Group operations while in Panama.

In November 1940, he boarded the merchant ship  on which he was met by the first mate, all the officers having been killed or injured on the bridge by a shell from Atlantis before they could destroy confidential documents. The survivors were unable to throw the documents overboard as the key to the strong room had been lost in the shelling.Seki, p. 62. The documents were eventually found by the Germans and included a secret British report stating that Britain would not be able to hold Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaya, and other interests in Asia if Japan were to attack them. Captain Rogge forwarded the documents to the German embassy in Tokyo who sent them to Berlin where a summary was communicated to the Japanese. Historians have speculated that the revelation to the Japanese of the weak state of British military power in Asia may have emboldened them to invade Singapore and played a part in the development of the war in the Pacific.Duffy, p. 23.How one merchant ship doomed a colony.
