From 1940 to 1943 he attended Kingston School of Art, and then, as a conscientious objector worked on the land. This caused a rift with his father, an Admiralty engineer, and was thought by his intimates to account, at least in part, for the palpable emotional depth and passion of his paintings.\nIn 1946, he began training at the Borough Polytechnic in Southwark (now London South Bank University), under David Bomberg, and in the same year he became a founder member of the influential Borough Group of artists. Fellow members included the Group's founding president, Cliff Holden, Dorothy Mead and Dennis Creffield. In 1952, he and his first wife, Eleanor (later Susanna) Richmond moved to Aix-en-Provence, France, and in 1954 to Ronda, Andalusia, Spain, where he lived and worked for over twenty years. At various times he taught art at Portsmouth Polytechnic and Morley College in London, where his students included Tatiana Litvinov, daughter of Joseph Stalin's one-time Foreign Minister. Other students included Nigel Caple (whom Richmond met at Portsmouth Polytechnic, and where Richmond came into severe conflict with marxists who were then dominant in the art department) and Rosie Skaife d'Ingerthorpe, who had graduated from Goldsmiths College.\nHe moved back to Britain in 1979, later taking up residence in North Yorkshire, where he painted, exhibited and taught. Students came to train with him on study leave, especially from St Albans College of Art, later part of Hertfordshire University. In 1994, he moved to Middlesbrough with his second wife Miranda, where he painted until his death. His final exhibition of paintings opened on 7 November 2008 at the Boundary Gallery in north London; it included a room of his early works and a room of his last paintings.\nRichmond had a strong spiritual sense, regarding painting as similar to prayer, and nurtured a lifelong determination never to become what he called a \"dealer's artist\". A month before his death he published a letter in The Guardian very critical of a materialistic ethos in contemporary western art, provoked by the auction at Sotheby's of work by Damien Hirst.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Bomberg", "response": ["From 1945 to 1953, he worked as a teacher at Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) in London, where his pupils included Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Philip Holmes, Philip Holmes' website] Cliff Holden, Edna Mann, Dorothy Mead, Gustav Metzger, Dennis Creffield, Cecil Bailey, and Miles Richmond.Miles Richmond's website   David Bomberg House, one of the student halls of residences at London South Bank University, is named in his honour.
