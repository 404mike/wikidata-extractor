Following in the footsteps of The Giant Claw (2002) and Land of Giants (2003), special episodes of the nature documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs, Sea Monsters stars British wildlife presenter Nigel Marven as a \"time-travelling zoologist\" who travels to seven different periods of time in prehistory, diving in the \"seven deadliest seas of all time\" and encountering and interacting with the prehistoric creatures who inhabit them. The series is narrated by Karen Hayley.", "Following his work in The Giant Claw and Land of Giants, Marven was approached by Jasper James, producer of both episodes and director of Land of Giants, about Sea Monsters. Marven had a great passion for sharks and had already dived and swum together with the biggest sharks alive today, which led James to come up with the idea of a time-travelling programme in which Marven immersed himself in the deadliest seas of all time, diving with the largest sharks of all time as well as various other prehistoric sea creatures. Marven was enthusiastic about the project, referring to it as a \"mouthwatering prospect\" in the companion book to the series.
