He went on to make 85 first-team appearances for the club before being loaned to Wigan Athletic early in the 2015\u201316 season. He left Watford at the end of the season to join Swindon Town and then joined Colchester United in January 2017. He left Colchester in summer 2018 and joined Danish Superliga side Vejle Boldklub.

He did not take charge of Colchester until after the final game of the 2015\u201316 season, in which his assistant Steve Ball was named caretaker. The club signed a number of players in preparation for the 2016\u201317 season, including defenders Luke Prosser (who he appointed as captain) and Lewis Kinsella; midfielders Brennan Dickenson, Craig Slater and Doug Loft; and forwards Courtney Senior, Kurtis Guthrie, and Denny Johnstone. However top-scorer George Moncur was sold to Barnsley for \u00a3500,000. In his first match in charge on 6 August, McGreal guided his side to a 1\u20131 opening day draw away to Hartlepool United. He earned his first win on 13 August as his side defeated Cambridge United 2\u20130 at the Colchester Community Stadium. After three wins and one draw in Colchester's opening five league fixtures, McGreal was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for August. After an eleven-game winless run, McGreal's side went undefeated in December, earning ten points from a possible twelve which propelled Colchester up the League Two table away from the relegation zone. In turn, McGreal was shortlisted for the League Two Manager of the Month award for December. He won the award on 6 January 2017, becoming the first Colchester manager to win the award since Paul Lambert in January 2009. Later that month he signed Sean Murray on a free transfer from Swindon Town. The \"U's\" finished the season eighth in the table, one place and one point behind Blackpool in the play-offs, who would go on to achieve promotion. McGreal released eight players, whilst also losing top-scorer Chris Porter, who left on a free transfer to sign with Crewe Alexandra.", "Needing to find a new goalscorer for the 2017\u201318 season, McGreal signed Mikael Mandron from Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee. He also brought in goalkeeper Rene Gilmartin and midfielder Ryan Jackson. He made a series of loan signings to bolster the squad, which included the arrivals of Ryan Inniss, Brandon Comley, Kyel Reid and Brandon Hanlan. Colchester got off to a poor start, but improved and collected ten points from five games to earn McGreal another Manager of the Month nomination in October. The young side's good form continued into December, where they picked up 11 points from a possible 15 to earn him yet another Manager of the Month nomination. However they struggled in the second half of the campaign, despite holding on to top-scorer Sammie Szmodics in the January transfer window, and ended the season in 13th-place. McGreal released four senior players and seven from the U-23 team. Sam Walker and Sean Murray also departed after failing to agree new deals."]}, {"page": "Sean Murray", "response": ["Sean Murray may refer to:", "* Sean Murray (field hockey) (born 1997), Lisnagarvey player and senior Ireland international", "* Sean Murray (footballer, born 1993), Dundalk FC player and Irish youth international", "* Sean Murray (Gaelic footballer), Dublin player", "* Sean Murray (actor) (born 1977), notable for his role on the TV show NCIS", "* Sean Murray (politician) (1898\u20131961), Irish communist politician", "* Sean Murray (Irish republican), Irish republican from Belfast, Northern Ireland", "* Sean Murray (composer) (born 1965), notable for his work in the Call of Duty series", "* Sean Murray, co-founder and director of Hello Games"]}, {"page": "League of Ireland Player of the Month", "response": ["| Sean Murray"]}, {"page": "FAI International Football Awards", "response": ["|Sean Murray"]}, {"page": "Sean Murray (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sean Murray (footballer, born 1993)"]}, {"page": "Harefield Academy", "response": ["*Sean Murray, footballer"]}, {"page": "Sammie Szmodics", "response": ["Szmodics scored his first goal of the 2016\u201317 season on 27 August 2016 in Colchester's 2\u20130 win at Adams Park against Wycombe Wanderers.
