He founded a private art school, Rowlandson House, in the Hampstead Road in 1910.Baron and Sickert 2006, p. 80. It lasted until 1914; for most of that period its co-principal and chief financial supporter was the painter Sylvia Gosse, a former student of Sickert.Hartley 2013, pp. 189\u201390.

To this end she sought to work with Sylvia Gosse and Margaret Crabtree, two residents of Belsize Park who in October 1945 organised an \"anti-alien\" petition against plans to house Jewish refugees in the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead. The petition gained some press support and had the backing of Conservative MPs Charles Challen and Waldron Smithers as well as Ernest Benn and the Society for Individual Freedom. Tennant attempted to link Hamm in with this burgeoning movement and the pair held a meeting in Belsize Park on 21 November 1945 in an attempt to link Hamm with them.  Before the meeting Hamm removed a portrait of Oswald Mosley for fear of scaring off the Conservative-linked Tennant although in the end he was impressed by the strength of her commitment to anti-Semitism.Stephen Dorril, Blackshirt \u2013 Sir Oswald Mosley and british Fascism, Penguin, 2007, p. 549 The initiative was largely unsuccessful however as Hamm's methods of provocative street politics and the heckling of leftist meetings were far removed from the high society circles in which the likes of Gosse and Crabtree moved.Graham Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black: Sir Oswald Mosley and the Resurrection of British Fascism After 1945, London: I.B. Tauris, 2007, p. 40"]}, {"page": "Mary Godwin (artist)", "response": ["Others were considerably less complimentary to the modernism of The London Group.
