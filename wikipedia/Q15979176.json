W. Johnson asserted that Enoch Powell had attracted 2.5 million votes to the Conservatives, although the Conservative vote only increased by 1.7 million.

The Professor of Political Science Randall Hansen assessed a range of studies, including some which contended that Powell had made little or no difference to the result, but concluded that \"At the very least, Powell's effect was likely to have fired up the Conservative vote in constituencies which would have voted Tory in any event\". Election night commentators Michael Barratt and Jeffrey Preece dismissed any special \"Powell factor\", as did Conservative MPs Reginald Maudling, Timothy Raison and Hugh Dykes."]}, {"page": "Week Ending", "response": ["Week Ending was a satirical radio current affairs sketch show broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 1970 and 1998.
