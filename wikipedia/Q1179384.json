In the 59th minute England was awarded a direct free kick but Mortensen's shot was well saved by Borghi. But England began threatening again, and it was fifteen minutes before the Americans were able to get another shot. With eight minutes left, Charlie Colombo brought down Mortensen with an illegal tackle at the edge of the penalty area. England pleaded for a penalty kick, but the referee ruled it was outside the box. From Alf Ramsey's resulting free kick, Jimmy Mullen headed the ball for what he thought was a goal, but Borghi tipped it away at the last instant, and despite the protests of the English players, the referee ruled that the ball had not crossed the line and thus there was no goal. England did not threaten again, but the U.S. had one final chance in the 85th minute: Frank \"Peewee\" Wallace drew Williams out of position and fired a shot at the empty net, only to be denied by a sliding goal line clearance by Ramsey."]}, {"page": "1954 FIFA World Cup qualification", "response": ["* Jimmy Mullen"]}, {"page": "James Mullen", "response": ["James, Jim or Jimmy Mullen may refer to:", "* Jimmy Mullen (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20132002), Northern Irish footballer, Inside Forward for Barrow, Crystal Palace and Bristol City", "* Jimmy Mullen (footballer, born 1923) (1923\u20131987), English international football player for Wolverhampton Wanderers", "* Jimmy Mullen (footballer, born 1947), English football player for Rotherham United", "* Jimmy Mullen (footballer, born 1952), former Sheffield Wednesday & Cardiff City player; former manager of Blackpool, Burnley & Walsall", "* Jimmy Mullen (golfer) (born 1993), English golfer", "* Jimmy Mullen (River City), fictional character in Scottish soap opera"]}]}}
