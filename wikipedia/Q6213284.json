The visitors scored the opening goal within the first ten minutes, Don Cowan and Chris Beardsley linked up well before the latter provided a square pass to the onrushing Robin Shroot, who made no mistake from six yards out. Cowan then set-up Beardsley, who scored from 25-yards with a low drilled effort. After hitting the post and forcing Chris Day into making a number of saves, Colchester halved the deficit shortly after the interval when Karl Duguid's cross looped across the face of the goal and Ian Henderson's headed in from six yards. Stevenage restored their two-goal cushion ten minutes later, when Michael Bostwick picked up Phil Edwards' pass and saw his 30-yard shot take a deflection and wrong-foot Ben Williams in the Colchester goal.

Wilson connected with a low Darius Charles cross in the last minute of the match to give the home side their first league win in five outings.", "Stevenage's nine game unbeaten run was ended on 6 April, losing 3\u20130 away to Tranmere Rovers courtesy of two early goals from on loan striker Jake Cassidy, and a second-half strike from Lucas Akins. Three days later, on 9 April, Stevenage welcomed Preston North End to Broadhall Way, signalling the return of former manager Graham Westley, who left Stevenage in January 2012 to take up the vacant position at Deepdale. The game ended 1\u20131, stretching Stevenage's winless run to seven league games. Preston took the lead with just four minutes remaining, with substitute Iain Hume sliding the ball in from six yards out following Danny Mayor's through ball. Stevenage then equalised in the fourth minute of injury time, with captain Mark Roberts heading in Michael Bostwick's floated cross to ensure a share of the spoils. The result meant that Stevenage were in ninth position, six points away from the final play-off place with just six games remaining. Stevenage travelled to in-form Yeovil Town five days after the draw with Preston, looking to secure a first away win in just under two months. Stevenage won the match 6\u20130, recording their biggest Football League victory to date, as well as recording the joint biggest away victory of 2011\u201312 League One campaign. Stevenage took an early lead in the match when Patrick Agyemang was played into the area by Craig Reid, Agyemang then squared the ball across goal for Luke Freeman to score from close range. Yeovil were reduced to ten men when Michael Woods fouled Michael Bostwick. Agyemang scored Stevenage's second goal when he collected Jamaal Lascelles long pass, before calmly beating Sam Walker in the Yeovil goal. Two goals within the space of three second half minutes put the game beyond doubt, with Jon Ashton and Lascelles scoring headers from set pieces. Mark Roberts added a fifth goal with ten minutes remaining \u2014 prodding in Freeman's centre. Freeman then scored his second, and Stevenage's sixth, when Jordan Slew made room down the right wing after a neat interchange with Agyemang, before finding Freeman at the back post to tap in from six yards out. The club then welcomed play-off rivals Carlisle United to Broadhall Way, knowing that a defeat would virtually end the club's play-off hopes. Stevenage dominated the first-half, but were unable to take an advantage into the interval. The second half was a much more even affair, with both teams spurning goalscoring opportunities. The deadlock was broken with just fifteen minutes remaining, substitute John Mousinho, returning from a six-month injury lay-off, latched onto Stacy Long's chipped through ball, before crashing the ball into the goal off the crossbar. Four days later, on 21 April, Stevenage hosted another team hoping to snatch the final play-off place when Brentford travelled to Broadhall Way. Stevenage secured a 2\u20131 victory, consequently ending Brentford's play-off hopes in the process. The visitors had the opportunity to take the lead on the half hour mark when Jamaal Lascelles was adjudged to have pushed Clinton Morrison in the area. However, Clayton Donaldson's penalty rebounded off the crossbar and Stevenage were able to clear to ensure the teams went in level at half-time. Brentford were then handed another chance from the penalty spot five minutes after the interval, this time the referee deemed Jon Ashton to have fouled Morrison. Brentford's Sam Saunders stepped up and his powerful penalty rebounded off the post and into the arms of Chris Day. Just three minutes after the second penalty miss, Stevenage were one goal to the good. Craig Reid controlled Lawrie Wilson's low cross, before hitting a shot on the turn that bounced off the ground and past Brentford goalkeeper Simon Moore. Luke Freeman then doubled Stevenage's advantage ten minutes later, dispossessing Adam Thompson before cutting in and hitting a right-footed shot that crashed into the goal off the post. Saunders reduced the deficit in injury-time with a curling free-kick, although Stevenage held on to secure a vital victory. The third straight victory, coupled with Notts County's home loss to Bury, meant that Stevenage were back in the play-off places with just two games remaining. Stevenage then travelled to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United in a game that was televised live on Sky Sports on 28 April, and attracted a crowd of over 30,000 spectators. The game was an evening kick-off, meaning Stevenage had moved down to seventh in the league table as a result of Notts County's 4\u20133 win at Wycombe Wanderers earlier in the day. The game ended 2\u20132, with Stevenage taking a two-goal lead through strikes from Joel Byrom and Scott Laird, before Sheffield United's Richard Cresswell and Matthew Lowton restored parity. The draw meant that Stevenage had regained their place in sixth with just one game remaining.", "Similarly to the 2010\u201311 campaign, Stevenage faced Bury at home for the final game of the regular season. The team knew that a win against Bury would secure a place in the play-offs, irrespective of what both play-off rivals, Notts County and Carlisle United, did in their respective games. Stevenage won the match 3\u20130, opening the scoring midway through the first-half when Craig Reid quickly controlled Luke Freeman's left wing cross before striking the ball high into the roof of the net. News at half-time filtered around the stadium that Notts County were comfortably beating their opponents, Colchester United, and therefore nothing more than a win would suffice if Stevenage were to secure sixth place. Nerves were settled with ten minutes remaining when Robin Shroot was fouled in the area, and Joel Byrom stepped up to convert the spot-kick and double Stevenage's advantage. A third goal was added in injury-time when Shroot broke through the centre of midfield, before laying the ball out to substitute Chris Beardsley, who lashed in a shot at the near post that Bury goalkeeper Jonathan Bond could only get a hand to.", "The draw for the Fifth Round was made on 29 January, with Stevenage being dealt a home tie against Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur. The game was played on 19 February, and was also televised on ITV, ending in a 0\u20130 draw. Tottenham had the ball in the net early in the second-half, but Louis Saha's shot hit Scott Parker on the line, and the goal was consequently disallowed as a result of Parker being in an offside position. Stevenage's Joel Byrom had the hosts best efforts of the match with two long-range second-half strikes. Shortly after the game, the Quarter Final draw was made, with the winners of the tie facing a home game against Premier League side Bolton Wanderers. The replay was played on 7 March, and the game was also televised live on ESPN.", " Tottenham ran out 3\u20131 winners at White Hart Lane. Stevenage took a surprise lead after just three minutes, Joel Byrom's bursting run into the area was unfairly halted by Ryan Nelsen, with the referee awarding a penalty. Byrom stepped up and stroked the ball past Carlo Cudicini in the Tottenham goal. Tottenham restored parity twenty minutes later when Jermain Defoe latched onto Gareth Bale's long ball and subsequently fired the ball into the net from the edge of the area. The home side won a penalty just after the interval, Bale winning the penalty after he was adjudged to have been fouled by Stevenage captain Mark Roberts \u2014 Emmanuel Adebayor scored the resulting penalty. Stevenage spurned a number of opportunities to draw level, before Tottenham then added a third late-on when Defoe ran onto Bale's long throw-in before finishing from an acute angle."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["The first week of April saw new Sheffield Wednesday manager Dave Jones win the Football League One Manager of the Month award, while Michail Antonio just missed out on Player of the Month award. 7 April saw another early kick-off with Sheffield Wednesday playing West Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town who were six points behind Sheffield Wednesday in fourth place and with a game in hand \u2013 meaning if they won Wednesday and their game in hand they would be above The Owls on goal difference. While Sheffield Wednesday of course were still trying to catch Sheffield United and every game was seen as a must win game. After a goalless first half Sheffield Wednesday seemed to be much of the better team, which was surprising considering the importance of the game for both teams, as well as both teams being next to each other in the table. It was a much closer contest in relation to goals, as the last meeting at Hillsborough Stadium finished an amazing 4\u20134. On the fifty-fourth minute Spaniard Miguel Llera struck a free-kick round the wall and into the bottom corner, scoring his first goal for Wednesday and giving them a well deserved lead. Then Nile Ranger found himself through on goal eighteen minutes later and having missed a 'sitter' and hitting the bar earlier, he showed composure to double The Owls' lead and the game finished 0\u20132. Sheffield Wednesday went home happy in knowledge of the importance of the game and the fact that they won comfortably compared to what was expected to be a very tough game. Sheffield United played later on in the day and again won as they edged out a 2\u20131 victory over Bournemouth. Two days later on the Bank Holiday Monday The Owls played their third consecutive early kick-off in a row as they played back at home and were live on Sky Sports against Oldham Athletic. Sheffield Wednesday had so far had similar results against the same clubs as their rivals Sheffield United, such as both losing at the likes of Carlisle United, Charlton Athletic, and Walsall, and both winning against teams such as Bournemouth, Bury etc. And with the knowledge of Sheffield United losing to Oldham Athletic earlier on in the season at home, Wednesday needed to ensure that this did not happen here. Gary Madine scored just before half-time and then Keith Treacy's two crosses with each foot secured victory for The Owls as Miguel Llera and Ryan Lowe headed home from them. Sheffield United again played later, this time a day after Sheffield Wednesday and they won bottom of the league Rochdale. With both rivals in such good form as they aim for automatic promotion it was likely to be who 'slipped' up first. And unfortunately for Sheffield Wednesday it was them as they drew with Colchester United, who had drawn their last four games at home. This game finished 1\u20131 after an early goal from Ian Henderson from a poor mistake by Michail Antonio and Miguel Llera equalised in the second half but The Owls were unable to pull off those three vital points and drew meaning with Sheffield United winning they were four points behind their rivals with three games to go \u2013 so although it had once before in the season looked like Sheffield United had secured the automatic promotion spot, it looked near enough confirmed this time as they had such a large goal difference as well. During the week though Sheffield United star striker and player Ched Evans was in court for the R v Evans and McDonald criminal prosecution case. Ched Evans on the Friday was found guilty of rape and was sentenced to five years in jail, meaning Sheffield United were without their best player of the season, who had led them to victory in so many games and scored over thirty goals throughout the season. However, with Sheffield United in such good form, there was still little doubts about the outcome of the season. The next day Sheffield Wednesday faced Carlisle United who were fighting for a play-off spot and was a must win game for them as well. While Sheffield United were away to in-form Milton Keynes Dons who lay in fifth place. Chris Lines's right-footed shot rolled into the bottom corner in the twenty-sixth minute of the match to put Sheffield Wednesday 1 goal up. Sheffield United however had conceded in their game to make things as they stood Wednesday one point behind their city rivals with two games to go. As Sheffield United were still trailing, Wednesday were cruelly punished for not finishing their chances within the game as James Berrett equalised to send Carlisle United into jubilation. As the Sheffield United game had finished Wednesday still had several minutes of stoppage time to play. And their deserved goal came as Michail Antonio who had injured his right foot and right shoulder during the game, continued to play and dribbled round one player and finished in a tight corner to send the Sheffield Wednesday fans absolutely crazy as Antonio's winning goal came in the ninety-fifth minute of the game. This goal still gave Wednesday a chance as they were now one point behind Sheffield United thanks to that late, late goal. With both Sheffield clubs playing teams who were likely to be relegated by the last game of the season, the second-to-last games of the season were seen to most as the decider in the automatic promotion race. It was Sheffield Wednesday who kicked off first at three o'clock on the Saturday of the last weekend of April. They faced another difficult challenge as Brentford who they were playing away, were desperate for maximum points as they looked to get into the final play-off place. In the first-half it was Brentford who were the better side as they missed one 'sitter' and hit the bar from four-yards out and should have been in front. However, a free-kick saw Keith Treacy pick out the bottom corner as the goalkeeper was not covering his near post and was caught unaware of that possibility. Wednesday went into the break ahead, although they had scored against the run of play. The second half was similar to the first but Wednesday were playing better, but Brentford still had the better of the play. And then in the sixty-second minute Mark Beevers conceded a penalty and was lucky not to be sent off after already having a yellow card. Clayton Donaldson scored and Sheffield Wednesday still being on the back foot, were looking unlikely to win even though they so desperately had to. Then up-jumped Miguel Llera to head the ball up into the net four minutes later to put Wednesday back in front. After several misses from Brentford, a one-on-one and a great save from Stephen Bywater, Sheffield Wednesday went home with a 2\u20131 win. Sheffield United had a late kick-off and was live on Sky Sports and was being viewed by all supporters of both rival clubs. They played Stevenage who were in an incredible run of form going into the game, as they pushed for the final play-off place themselves. Although, Sheffield United started brightly they were unable to convert any chances and was missing their star player Ched Evans. And then joy for Stevenage and Sheffield Wednesday fans alike as Joel Byrom scored and put Stevenage one nil up at half-time. Two minutes into the second half and Stevenage scored again, sending The Owls and Stevenage wild again. Sheffield United had to win to stay above Sheffield Wednesday and pulled a goal back and then Matthew Lowton equalised to make it 2\u20132 with five minutes to go plus stoppage time. It was the most tense and heart-racing moments of both Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday as they knew one goal for The Blades in those final moments could be the decisive goal in the automatic promotion race. A fabulous save from Chris Day in the final minutes was able to stop Sheffield United and they could only manage to draw. Meaning Sheffield Wednesday after such an amazing season, for fans of both clubs and the neutral, were now second and in the driving seat for automatic promotion."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["|13||Joel Byrom||CM||||Oswaldtwistle||||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||1 July 2012||Stevenage||Free||30 June 2014", "|MF||||13||Joel Byrom||2||1||0||0||3", "|13||||MF||Joel Byrom||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["Ahead of the season, there were wholesale changes involving the playing squad.
