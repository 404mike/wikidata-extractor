The entire field jogged through the first 400 at warm up pace, 1:15.84.  Blankenship found himself in the lead, looking around as if, \"where is everybody?\"  At 600 metres, in 1:52.48, finally 18 year old Samuel Tefera came forward, the pace quickened slightly.  He was joined by teammate Aman Wote and the pace began to get quicker, though still not 30 per lap pace.  800 metres in 2:23.68.  Iguider came back to Tefera's shoulder, both speeding up to run a 28.49 lap, 1000 metres in 2:52.16.  Blankenship held on to their back, Wote boxing him in on the outside.  A 27.38 lap for 1200 in 3:19.54.  Jake Wightman ran out in lane 3 to run around the crowd into third place as Iguider squeezed into the lead on the inside.  With 300 metres to go, Marcin Lewandowski, known more as an 800 metres runner, was at the back of the pack, but he too moved to the outside and started sprinting past the field, reaching Wightman at the bell.  Wightman held Lewandowski to the outside of the penultimate turn but on the backstretch, he passed and set off after Tefera and Iguider.  A 25.38 lap, 3:44.84 would have won the race most years, but they still had 100 metres to go.  It came down to a final 50 metre sprint on the home stretch.  Tefera passed Iguider and ran away to victory, with Lewandowski in full sprint behind him.  A desperate Iguider began leaning five metres before the finish, but he couldn't hold off Lewandowski speeding past for silver.  For Iguider, it was his second bronze medal in this event, to go along with the complete set of medals he had already collected between 2010 and 2014.", "|12 || 3 || align=left|Jake Wightman || align=left| || 3:47.23 || Q", "|6 || align=left|Jake Wightman || align=left| || 3:58.91 || "]}, {"page": "2018 British Athletics Championships", "response": ["| Jake Wightman || 3:46.86"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2018 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|align=left|Jake Wightman"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["| Jake HeywardJosh KerrJake Wightman"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Jake Wightman"]}, {"page": "2018 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 1500 metres", "response": ["| 1 || 3 || 2 || align=left|Jake Wightman || align=left| || 3:40.73 ||  ", "|  || align=left|Jake Wightman || align=left| || 3:38.25 ||  "]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres", "response": ["After the runners sorted themselves out at the start of the final, Jakob, the only Ingebrigtsen in the race, moved around the pack to take the lead and press the pace.

The race was in a single file line, Stewart McSweyn and Ollie Hoare next in line, Abel Kipsang on the outside trying to get past the two Australians. Second lap 1:51.8, a 55.6 by Cheruiyot. Hoare began moving backward, Jake Wightman came forward to race Kipsang. A gap formed between the lead group of Cheruiyot, Ingebrigtsen and McSweyn, with Kipsang leading the line of chasers. Through the penultimate turn, McSweyn couldn't keep up and the leaders were two. Lap 3 2:47.3, a 55.5. Ingebrigtsen glued to the back of Cheruiyot. Josh Kerr chasing Kipsang for bronze. Through the final turn, Ingebrigtsen moved up on Cheruiyot, then past. Cheruiyot looked back to see who else was going to try to pass him, an obvious sign he had nothing more to offer to chase Ingebrigtsen.

From the gun, Cheruiyot and his Kenyan teammate Ronald Kwemoi went out hard, breaking away by 2 metres in the first 200.  The guys who usually drop to the back realized this was serious and started scrambling to the front.  Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz Jr. and silver medalist Taoufik Makhloufi formed a chase group 5 metres back, Jakob Ingebrigtsen leading the peloton another 5 metres back.  Over the next lap, the chasers fell back to the peloton, the breakaway now 10 metres.  Cheruiyot kept up the pressure, over the next half lap, Kwemoi fell off his back.  By the bell, Kwemoi was back to the peloton, again led by Makhloufi.  The next on the front were Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr.  It appeared a more mature 23 year old Cheruiyot had learned from his fast early pace at the 2015 World Relays where he fell apart on the last lap.  Here, there was no sign of letting up.  Down the backstretch, coming from 9th place, Marcin Lewandowski ran around the outside of the pack, hitting Makhloufi's shoulder by the beginning of the final turn.  The other competitors were already fully extended and couldn't make any dramatic moves.  Cheruiyot crossed the finish line 17 metres ahead of Makhloufi.  Lewandowski was able to stay a metre behind Makhloufi, trying to nudge ahead in vain at the finish line.
