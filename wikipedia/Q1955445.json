With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never made mainstream success due to his work being issued mostly in limited editions on small record labels and being deeply experimental in style. His music has been described by one critic as \"among the most startling and unique in the noise underground.\"The name Muslimgauze is a play on the word muslin (a type of gauze) combined with Muslim, referring to Bryn Jones' preoccupation with conflicts throughout the Muslim world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1961", "response": ["** Muslimgauze, British ethnic electronica and experimental musician (d. 1999) "]}, {"page": "1991 in music", "response": ["| United States of Islam || Muslimgauze ||-"]}, {"page": "1995 in music", "response": ["| Izlamaphobia || Muslimgauze ||-"]}, {"page": "Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko", "response": ["A track entitled \"Homily to Popie\u0142uszko\" is featured on the B-side to the album Flajelata (1986) by Muslimgauze.

Their third album, \"Limb Shop\" (released on Raging Planet, Base records, Soopa and Radon in 2006), was produced by Jonathan Uliel Saldanha, moving the sound of the group a step deeper into an abstract landscape of field recordings, brute noise and crepuscular heavy funk and dub.
