Motor racing driver John Batchelor took over the club in March 2002, and by December the club had gone into administration.

Batchelor left having diverted almost all of the \u00a3400,000 received from a sponsorship deal with Persimmon to his racing team, and having failed to deliver on his promise of having ST members on the board.

It was announced that the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and talks were held over a move to Huntington Stadium. In March 2002, the club was bought by John Batchelor; he said York could continue at Bootham Crescent until a new stadium was built, when in fact the previous 25-year lease was replaced with one that would expire in June 2003. Batchelor spoke of building a new stadium at Clifton Moor, and Persimmon, who held 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted planning applications for 93 homes on the site of Bootham Crescent. In March 2003, York extended their lease of the ground to May 2004, and under the ownership of the Supporters' Trust proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium. Planning problems arose with bringing the ground up to Football League standards, and the club preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent. York bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004, after a \u00a32\u00a0million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) was secured."]}, {"page": "Douglas Craig", "response": ["In July 1999, Craig wrote to all York City's shareholders, asking them to approve a plan to transfer the club, and Bootham Crescent, to a new company, Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH).

He made his debut three weeks later in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Cardiff City in an FA Cup first-round replay, entering as a 72nd-minute substitute after John Achterberg was sent off. Tranmere did not concede during Howarth's 18 minutes on the pitch, and his performance was positive. However, with Achterberg established in the Tranmere goal, Howarth had to wait until 4 February 2003 to make his league debut away to Cheltenham Town, coming on as a substitute in the 57th minute after Achterberg sustained an injury. He conceded twice as Tranmere lost 3\u20131. Howarth returned to the substitutes' bench for the following match against Swindon Town on 8 February 2003, as Achterberg had recovered from injury.
