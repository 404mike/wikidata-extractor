This time, Denmark did not withdraw and beat Wales in the group's opening match in Copenhagen in October 1964, thanks to Ole Madsen scoring the only goal of the game. Mimis Papaioannou and Andreas Papaemmanouil gave Greece a 2\u20130 win in Wales' next game in December. Papaioannou was on the scoresheet again in the two sides' meeting in Cardiff in March 1965, but it proved to be mere consolation as a brace from Ivor Allchurch and further goals from Mike England and Roy Vernon gave Wales a 4\u20131 win; however, defeat to the Soviet Union in Moscow in May, thanks to a goal from Valentin Ivanov and an own goal by Graham Williams, meant Wales' hopes of qualification were now out of their hands. The Soviet Union won their next three games, scoring 13 goals in the process and ending Wales' campaign, but the return fixture between the two sides in October 1965 saw Wales come out on top in Cardiff; Anatoliy Banishevskiy opened the scoring for the USSR, but Vernon equalised three minutes later, before Ivor Allchurch scored the winner with 13 minutes to go. Wales played their final qualifier at home to Denmark in Wrexham in December 1965, and a 4\u20132 win thanks to goals from Wyn Davies, Roy Vernon (2) and Ronnie Rees, meant they finished second in the group, four points behind the Soviet Union."]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Ronnie Rees", "|align=left| Ronnie Rees", "|align=left| Bobby Gould Neil Martin Ronnie Rees", "|align=left| Gerry Baker Willie Carr Ernie Hannigan Ernie Machin Ronnie Rees"]}, {"page": "List of Nottingham Forest F.C. internationals", "response": ["*Ronnie Rees"]}]}}
