The name of the family was introduced (as Alcedia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. It is divided into three subfamilies, the tree kingfishers (Halcyoninae), the river kingfishers (Alcedininae) and the water kingfishers (Cerylinae). The name Daceloninae is sometimes used for the tree kingfisher subfamily but it was introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1841 while Halcyoninae introduced by Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825 is earlier and has priority. A few taxonomists elevate the three subfamilies to family status. In spite of the word \"kingfisher\" in their English vernacular names, many of these birds are not specialist fish-eaters; none of the species in Halcyoninae are."]}, {"page": "Ornithology", "response": ["The search for patterns in the variations of birds was attempted by many. Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775\u20131854), his student Johann Baptist von Spix (1781\u20131826), and several others believed that a hidden and innate mathematical order existed in the forms of birds. They believed that a \"natural\" classification was available and superior to \"artificial\" ones. A particularly popular idea was the Quinarian system popularised by Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785\u20131840), William Sharp Macleay (1792\u20131865), William Swainson, and others. The idea was that nature followed a \"rule of five\" with five groups nested hierarchically. Some had attempted a rule of four, but Johann Jakob Kaup (1803\u20131873) insisted that the number five was special, noting that other natural entities such as the senses also came in fives. He followed this idea and demonstrated his view of the order within the crow family. Where he failed to find five genera, he left a blank insisting that a new genus would be found to fill these gaps. These ideas were replaced by more complex \"maps\" of affinities in works by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alfred Russel Wallace. A major advance was made by Max F\u00fcrbringer in 1888, who established a comprehensive phylogeny of birds based on anatomy, morphology, distribution, and biology. This was developed further by Hans Gadow and others."]}, {"page": "Nightjar", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors"]}, {"page": "Zosterops", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785\u20131840), Irish zoologist who popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system"]}, {"page": "Loon", "response": ["The term gavia was transferred from the ducks to the loons only in the 18th century.

Larks are a well-defined family, partly because of the shape of their . They have multiple scutes on the hind side of their tarsi, rather than the single plate found in most songbirds. They also lack a pessulus, the bony central structure in the syrinx of songbirds.  They were long placed at or near the beginning of the songbirds or oscines (now often called Passeri), just after the suboscines and before the swallows, for example in the American Ornithologists' Union's first check-list.  Some authorities, such as the British Ornithologists' Union and the Handbook of the Birds of the World, adhere to that placement.  However, many other classifications follow the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy in placing the larks in a large oscine subgroup Passerida (which excludes crows, shrikes and their allies, vireos, and many groups characteristic of Australia and southeastern Asia).  For instance, the American Ornithologists' Union places larks just after the crows, shrikes, and vireos.  At a finer level of detail, some now place the larks at the beginning of a superfamily Sylvioidea with the swallows, various \"Old World warbler\" and \"babbler\" groups, and others. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that within the Sylvioidea the larks form a sister clade to the family Panuridae which contains a single species, the bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus).

Measuring  in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue, or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white irises, younger adults have white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name (coronoides) highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow (C. corone). Two subspecies are recognized, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically.", "The Australian raven was first described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, when they reported George Caley's early notes on the species from the Sydney district. Its specific epithet coronoides \"crow-shaped\" is derived from the Greek corone/\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7 \"crow\" and eidos/\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \"shape\" or \"form\". The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the carrion crow (C. corone) of Europe, though they noted it was larger with a longer bill. They did not give it a common name. The location where the type specimen was collected is not recorded, but thought to be in the Parramatta district. Christian Ludwig Brehm described Corvus affinis in 1845, later determined to be this species. In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, John Gould recognised only one species of corvid in Australia, Corvus australis, which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Johann Friedrich Gmelin's 1788 name, which predated Vigors and Horsfield's description. In 1877 Richard Bowdler Sharpe recognised two species, but recorded that the feather bases of the type specimen of C. coronoides were white. He named C. coronoides as the \"crow\" and C. australis (as Corone australis) the \"raven\". Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant corrected this in 1912 after re-examining the type specimen, clarifying the species as C. coronoides (raven, and incorporating little and forest ravens) and C. cecilae (Torresian crow).", "Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors"]}, {"page": "Ibisbill", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors"]}, {"page": "Black-headed jay", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors"]}, {"page": "Willie wagtail", "response": ["The willie wagtail was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as Turdus leucophrys.
