He removed British troops from Lampedusa on 25 September 1814, ending the dispute that had started in 1800. On Malta, he was autocratic and he refused to form an advisory council made up of Maltese representatives, and so he was informally known as \"King Tom\". He formed the Malta Police Force in 1814, while the local Italian-speaking Universit\u00e0 was dissolved in 1819. Various reforms were undertaken in taxation and the law courts as well. Maitland remained Governor until his death from apoplexy on 17 January 1824. He was attended on his death-bed by doctors Robert Grieves, Alexander Broadfoot and John Hennen."]}, {"page": "King's Chapel, Gibraltar", "response": ["*Dr John Hennen, military surgeon and author of The Principles of Military Surgery"]}, {"page": "List of Mayo people", "response": ["* John Hennen \u2013 FRSE military surgeon."]}, {"page": "Hennen, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Hennen"]}]}}
