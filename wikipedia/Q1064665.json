Gibbs-Smith wrote that \"there has recently arisen some controversy about this machine, designed by the Rumanian-born and French-domiciled Henri Coanda, which was exhibited at the Paris salon in October 1910. Until recently it has been accepted as an all-wood sesquiplane, with cantilever wings, powered by a 50\u00a0hp Clerget engine driving a 'turbo-propulseur' in the form of a large but simple ducted air fan. This fan was fitted right across the machine's nose and the cowling covered the nose and part of the engine: the resulting 'jet' of plain air was to propel the aeroplane.\" He wrote that \"no claims that it flew, or was even tested, were made at the time\", and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the 1950s\u2014the aircraft was thus \"disinterred from its obscurity.\" He wrote that the airfield at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a former military exercise ground where the test supposedly took place, was under the constant observation of the French Army who owned it, by French aviation reporters and photographers, and by aviation experts from other countries. He said that the airfield was the \"most famous, most used, most observed, and most reported-on 'airfield' in Paris\", and that all events, let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire, would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports, but no contemporary accounts exist of the Coand\u0103-1910 being tested, flown or destroyed. Gibbs-Smith countered the Coand\u0103 assertions point by point, saying that the aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage, did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots, did not have a fuel tank overhead in the wing, and did not have fuel injected into any turbine. Gibbs-Smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any combustion had been initiated in the engine's air stream."]}, {"page": "National Air and Space Museum", "response": ["The museum has four research fellowships: Charles A.
