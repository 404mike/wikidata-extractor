In 1916, he was received at Somerville Hospital in Oxford. After being assigned to No. 20 Squadron RAF as an observer gunner, he won his first dogfight by setting afire a Fokker Dr.I on 9 May 1918. In the end of May, he had eight wins to his credit. On 2 July he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He tallied only a single kill in July, on the 24th. His last six victories came in September 1918. In summary, only three of his victories were the \"soft\" out of control sort, and all but two were over enemy fighter aircraft.Mills won nine times while being piloted by Captain Thomas Middleton, and three while Lieutenant Paul Iaccaci was at the helm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerville College, Oxford", "response": ["Notable patients who stayed in Somerville include the war poets Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon and R. E. Vern\u00e8de. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford, Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it very much like Paradise. At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy. Alfred Mills was received in the hospital in 1916 and officer Llewelyn Davies died at the college.Du Ruvigny & Raineval (1922)."]}, {"page": "Alfred Mills (aviator)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Mills"]}]}}
