After training in early life to become an engineer, he turned his attention to the nonconformist ministry. He was educated at the Swansea Academy of G. P. Evans, and later at Pontypool.Ordained at Treorchy in 1868, he later became secretary of the Baptist Union of Wales from 1879 until 1898, and later became its president. Under his leadership the membership at Noddfa increased rapidly and branch chapels were established including Ainon, Treorchy and Bethel, Cwmpark.\nA popular lecturer, Morris also supported cultural, temperance, and educational movements in the Rhondda Valley. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and in 1902 he visited the United States of America and was awarded an honorary degree by Bucknell University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhondda (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The local trade union, the Rhondda Steam Coal Miners' Association, laid claim to the candidacy as early as 1883, on the basis that the franchise had been extended to many working men within the county constituencies and that in Mabon, their agent for six years they had the ideal candidate. The local Liberal Association, however, formed in early 1885,was dominated by middle-class business and professional men, and included a disproportionate number of colliery officials. . Lewis Davis of Ferndale, brother of David Davis, Maesyffynnon, one of the leading coalowners in the valley, was selected as president of the association. Ministers, including William Morris of Noddfa, Treorchy were also prominent. At a meeting in April 1885 six names were put forward as possible candidates for the nomination, including Lewis Davis, Mabon and Alfred Thomas, a leading figure in the municipal life of Cardiff.. Shortly afterwards, Lewis Davis was invited by the Association to be its parliamentary candidate and defeated Mabon in a ballot by 143 votes to 51. In spite of his selection, however, he declined and proposed that his son, the 22-year-old Frederick Lewis Davis, be the candidate. In a further ballot, F.L. Davis again defeated Mabon by 125 votes to 56."]}, {"page": "William Morris (disambiguation)", "response": ["William Morris (1834\u20131896) was a British writer, designer and socialist.", "* William Morris, known as Haldreyn (born 1937), Cornish poet", "*Captain William Morris, a fictional character in the Richard Sharpe novels", "*William Morris (actor) (1861\u20131936), American actor", "*William Morris (glass artist) (born 1957), American glass artist", "*William Morris Agency, a Hollywood talent agency", "*William Morris Endeavor, a Hollywood talent agency", "*William Morris Fine Arts, ex-owner of the Morris Singer foundry", "*William Morris (Canadian businessman) (1786\u20131858), businessman and political figure in Upper Canada", "*William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield (1877\u20131963), British motor manufacturer and philanthropist", "*William Morris Jr. (1899\u20131989), American talent agent and president of the William Morris Agency", "*William Morris (British Army officer) (1820\u20131858), British soldier who rode in the Charge of the Light Brigade", "*William Morris (Irish mayor), mayor of Galway, 1527\u201328", "*William Morris (British politician) (1811\u20131877), Liberal MP for Carmarthen Boroughs, and banker", "*William Morris (Baptist minister) (1843\u20131922), minister in South Wales", "*William Morris (Irish priest), Dean of Clogher, 1959\u20131962", "*William Morris (Church of Scotland minister) (1925\u20132013), Church of Scotland minister and author", "*William Morris (English cricketer) (1873\u20131945), English cricketer", "*William Morris (Australian cricketer) (born 1918), Australian cricketer", "*William Morris (British sport shooter), completed in 1908 Olympics", "*William Morris (American sport shooter) (born 1939), American Olympic sport shooter (1964)", "*Speedy Morris (William Morris, born 1942), American college basketball coach", "*William Morris, litblogger at A Motley Vision"]}, {"page": "List of Baptists", "response": ["*William Morris (1843\u20131922, W) minister and President of the Baptist Union of Wales"]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*21 December \u2013 William Morris (Rhosynnog), Baptist minister, 79"]}, {"page": "1843 in Wales", "response": ["*12 September \u2013 William Morris, Baptist minister (died 1922)"]}, {"page": "1889 Glamorgan County Council election", "response": ["In the Rhondda district the success of William Abraham (Mabon) at the 1885 General Election had led to the emergence of a Rhondda Liberal and Labour Association within which working class leaders were active.

It is also significant that most of the official Liberal candidates had supported the official Liberal candidate, Frederick Davis, in 1885, rather than the Lib-Lab Mabon.
