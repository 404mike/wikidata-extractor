She is the co-author of several Pevsner guides.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ham House", "response": ["The house is built of red brick, and was originally constructed to a traditional Elizabethan era H-plan. The southern, garden, frontage was infilled during the Lauderdales' rebuilding. The architect of Vavasour's house is unknown although drawings by Robert Smythson and his son John exist. The Lauderdales first consulted William Bruce, a cousin of the Duchess, but ultimately employed William Samwell to undertake their rebuilding. Ham retains many original Jacobean and Caroline features and furnishings, most in an unusually fine condition, and is a \"rare survival of 17th-century luxury and taste\". The house is a Grade I listed building and received museum accreditation from Arts Council England in 2015. Its park and formal gardens are listed at Grade II*. Bridget Cherry, in the revised London: South Pevsner published in 2002, acknowledged that the exterior of Ham was \"not as attractive as other houses of this period\", but noted the interior's \"high architectural and decorative interest\". The critic John Julius Norwich described the house as a \"time machine - enclosing one in the elegant, opulent world of Van Dyck and Lely\".", "Ham House is a brick building of three storeys and nine bays, with a hip roof and ashlar dressings, representing two distinctively different architectural styles and periods. Michael Wilson, referencing Ham in his work, The English Country House and its furnishings, considers the later 17th century as the finest period of English brick building. The first phase is the original main house facing north-east to the river Thames, built in 1610 in the early Jacobean English renaissance style on a traditional H-plan for Thomas Vavasour, Knight Marshal at the court of James I. Simon Jenkins, in his study, England's Thousand Best Houses, records that the original entrance had a tower over the porch and flanking, projecting turrets, which were removed in subsequent reconstruction, and suggests that Vavasour\u2019s original house may have been of an E-plan type. John Julius Norwich also notes the original configuration of the north front, which he considers \"forbidding\", and the \"damson-coloured\" brickwork. Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, in the London: South volume of the Buildings of England series, record the \"not specially impressive\" nature of the remaining doorway but are clear that Ham was built to an H-plan. The architect of Vavasour's house is not known although survey drawings by Robert and John Smythson exist.", "Ham House is unusual in retaining much of its original 17th-century interior decoration, offering a rare experience of the style of the courts of Charles I and Charles II. Ham House's rooms display collections of 17th-century paintings, portraits and miniatures, in addition to cabinets, tapestries and furniture amassed and retained by generations of the Murray and Tollemache families. Geoffrey Beard, in his study, The National Trust Book of English Furniture, noted the extraordinarily high quality of the Lauderdales' furnishing of the house, undertaken with \"a lavishness which transcended even what was fitting to their exalted rank\". Bridget Cherry, in the London: South Pevsner suggested that, while the exterior of Ham was \"not as attractive as other houses of this period\", the \"high architectural and decorative interest\" of its interior should be recognised. John Julius Norwich considered the interiors, a \"time machine - enclosing one in the elegant, opulent world of Van Dyck and Lely\"."]}, {"page": "St Mary's University, Twickenham", "response": ["Near the porter's lodge is what Bridget Cherry and Sir Nikolaus Pevsner describe as an \"incongruous Walpole survival without its protective vegetation\". The Grade I listed Chapel in the Wood is a garden building designed in 1772 by John Chute and was completed in 1774 by Thomas Gayfere the Elder. It was restored in 1954 as a chapel to include a shrine of the Virgin Mary, with new murals and stained glass by Harry Clarke. The stained glass that Walpole housed within it is now at its original home at Bexhill Church, Sussex."]}, {"page": "Tudor Revival architecture", "response": ["Later came Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott (1865\u20131945) and Blair Imrie who made their names as Tudor style architects.  Lutyens though took the style away from what is generally understood as Tudor Revival creating a further highly personalised style of his own.  His buildings coupled with their often accompanying gardens by Gertrude Jekyll, while in a style thought of as \"olde world\" would not be recognisable to inhabitants of the 16th century. Another noted practitioner was George A. Crawley. A decorator and designer, rather than an architect, Crawley greatly expanded the original medieval hall house, Crowhurst Place in Surrey, firstly for himself and latterly for Consuelo Vanderbilt. The result, \"remarkable in its own right\", saw Crawley add extensions, chimneys, gables, linenfold panelling and large amounts of half-timbering. Martin Conway, writing in Country Life, considered Crawley's reconstruction gave the remains of the original manor, \"a beauty far greater than was ever theirs in the days of its newness\". Ian Nairn, Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry, in the 1971 revised Surrey Pevsner Buildings of England, note the sense of escapism which inspired much of the Tudor Revival, calling Crowhurst, \"an extreme example of the English flight from reality around the 1914-18 war\"."]}, {"page": "The Tower House", "response": ["The architectural writer Bridget Cherry wrote that \"the sturdy exterior gives little hint of the fantasy [Burges] created inside\", interiors which the art historian and Burges scholar Charles Handley-Read described as \"at once opulent, aggressive, obsessional, enchanting, their grandeur border[ing] on grandiloquence\". Each room has a complex iconographic scheme of decoration: in the hall it is Time; in the drawing room, Love; in Burges's bedroom, the Sea. Massive fireplaces with elaborate overmantels were carved and installed, described by Crook as \"veritable altars of art\u00a0... some of the most amazing pieces of decoration Burges ever designed\". Handley-Read considered that Burges's decorations were \"unique, almost magical [and] quite unlike anything designed by his contemporaries\".", "More recent coverage was given in London 3: North West, the revision to the Buildings of England guide to London written by Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry, published in 1991 (revised 2002). The house is referenced in Matthew Williams's William Burges (2004), and in Panoramas of Lost London by Philip Davies, published in 2011, which includes some of Francis Bedford's photographs of the house from 1885. In a chapter on the building in Great Houses of London (2012), the author James Stourton called The Tower House \"the most singular of London houses, even including the Soane Museum.\""]}]}}
