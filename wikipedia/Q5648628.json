He was rumored to be married to an illegitimate child of king George IV, later but historians consider it to be \"improbable\". As consul he played an important role in assisting British exploration of the Niger river.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Gordon Laing", "response": ["Laing's papers were never recovered, and his father-in-law, Hanmer Warrington, accused the French (who also wanted to reach Timbuktu) of interference and having procured Laing's journal; however, there has never been any evidence for this. Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9 reached Timbuktu two years after Laing and by returning alive was able to claim the 10,000-franc prize offered by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie for the feat. Both men were awarded the Gold Medal of the Society for 1830. In 1903, the French government placed a tablet bearing Laing's name and the date of his visit on the house occupied by him during his 38-day stay in Timbuktu. This house, located in the Djingareiber district, inside the old town, was declared a National Heritage by decree of 18 December 1992."]}, {"page": "Dixon Denham", "response": ["Denham was to find the bashaw as obdurate as Murzuk's bey. Outraged, he decided to return to London to report the situation to Lord Bathurst and also seek promotion, so that he could return as commanding officer of the expedition. Boarding a ship bound for Marseilles, he warned the bashaw's lieutenants of his government's displeasure when it learned of the  bashaw's 'duplicity'. Duly alarmed, the bashaw wrote to him, proposing that the 300man escort of a wealthy merchant about to depart for Bornu could, for a fee of 10,000 dollars to be shared with him, be persuaded to protect the mission as well. Denham received the letter while in quarantine in Marseilles.  Still very angry, he sent an ill-judged letter to Bathurst complaining of Oudney's incompetence.  The missal was not well received in London, and Denham found a letter awaiting him on his return to Tripoli, rebuking him for his lack of diplomacy, although acknowledging the frustrations he had endured. News of Denham's conduct left his compatriots at Murzuk dumbfounded. Oudney wrote a bitter letter of complaint about Denham to Hanmer Warrington, the British Consul in Tripoli, comparing Denham to a snake hidden in the grass. In an unfortunate breach of confidence, Warrington showed the letter to Denham, thereby souring relations within the mission party still further."]}]}}
