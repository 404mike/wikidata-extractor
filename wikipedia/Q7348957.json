Heraud made two attempts at epic grandeur in his poems The Descent into Hell, 1830, and The Judgment of the Flood, 1834. The view of Chambers's Cyclop\u00e6dia of English Literature was that he attempted in poetry what John Martin did in art: the vast, the remote, and the terrible. It found his Descent and Judgment to be \"psychological curiosities\" of \"misplaced power\". George Saintsbury put Heraud on a level with Edwin Atherstone, and above Robert Pollok. Herbert Tucker regards the Judgement of the Flood as \"deranged\", but has more time for the Descent into Hell. He places it with other, earlier attempts to dramatise Christian typology, such as those of William Gilbank and Elizabeth Smith of Birmingham. He notes Heraud's familiarity with Coleridge's apologetics, and his reference to Martin in the annotations."]}, {"page": "Robert Pollack", "response": ["*Robert Pollok (1798\u20131827), Scottish poet best known for The Course of Time", "*Robert Pollok (British Army officer) (1884\u20131979), Irish-born British Army officer"]}, {"page": "1827 in poetry", "response": ["* Robert Pollok, The Course of Time, Scottish", "* September 15 \u2013 Robert Pollok (born c. 1798), Scottish"]}, {"page": "The Course of Time", "response": ["The Course of Time is a ten-book poem in blank verse, first published in 1827.
