Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: \"I think it's fair to say that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football.\" Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2\u20130 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2\u20130 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2\u20130 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player.
