In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932\u201333, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936\u201337 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3\u20132 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947\u201348. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bodyline", "response": ["Bradman missed the first Test at Sydney, worn out by constant cricket and the ongoing argument with the Board of Control.Frith, p. 109. Jardine later wrote that the real reason was that the batsman had suffered a nervous breakdown.Haigh and Frith, p. 71. The English bowlers used bodyline intermittently in the first match, to the crowd's vocal displeasure,Frith, pp. 117, 120, 126, 134. and the Australians lost the game by ten wickets. Larwood was particularly successful, returning match figures of ten wickets for 124 runs.Frith, p. 137. One of the English bowlers, Gubby Allen, refused to bowl with fielders on the leg side, clashing with Jardine over these tactics.Frith, p. 116. The only Australian batsman to make an impact was Stan McCabe, who hooked and pulled everything aimed at his upper body,Colman, p. 172. to score 187 not out in four hours from 233 deliveries. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling.Frith, pp. 134\u201335.", "The English players and management were consistent in referring to their tactic as fast leg theory considering it to be a variant of the established and unobjectionable leg theory tactic. The inflammatory term \"bodyline\" was coined and perpetuated by the Australian press (see below). English writers used the term fast leg theory. The terminology reflected differences in understanding, as neither the English public nor the Board of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)\u2014the governing body of English cricket\u2014could understand why the Australians were complaining about what they perceived as a commonly used tactic. Some concluded that the Australian cricket authorities and public were sore losers.Frith, pp. 142, 222, 231\u2013238.Pollard, p. 258. Of the four fast bowlers in the tour party, Gubby Allen was a voice of dissent in the English camp, refusing to bowl short on the leg side, and writing several letters home to England critical of Jardine, although he did not express this in public in Australia. A number of other players, while maintaining a united front in public, also deplored bodyline in private. The amateurs Bob Wyatt (the vice-captain), Freddie Brown and the Nawab of Pataudi opposed it, as did Wally Hammond and Les Ames among the professionals.E. W. Swanton.

In addition to representing Eton at fives, he was a capable cricketer at school, club and county level, and was unique among British prime ministers in having played first-class cricket.

Wisden observed, \"In the rain-affected Eton\u2013Harrow match of 1922 he scored 66, despite being hindered by a saturated outfield, and then took 4 for 37 with his medium-paced out-swingers\"."]}, {"page": "John Paul Getty Jr.", "response": ["Following his father's death in 1976, Getty spent the next decade suffering from depression and checked himself into The London Clinic in 1984.

He played in four Tests and, on debut, took seven for 103 in the first innings of the first Test. This tour was a disaster for MCC and the 1947 edition of Playfair Cricket Annual (Playfair) headlined it as \"An Ill-Starred Venture\".Playfair 1947, p. 11. Planning and preparation were poor and the team was badly led by Gubby Allen. Playfair said Laker was the only player who \"really justified his selection\". Wisden said Laker \"excelled\" and was \"undoubtedly the find of the tour\", despite problems with an abdominal injury."]}, {"page": "George Allen", "response": ["* Gubby Allen (Sir George Oswald Browning Allen, 1902\u20131989), Australian-born English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Kim Hughes", "response": ["The Centenary Test at Lord's Cricket Ground in August 1980 was a triumph for Hughes. Much of the first three days' play was lost due to bad weather but in that time Hughes played what Wisden would describe as \"two innings of the highest quality.\" Hughes scored a century in the first innings, 117 runs including 14 fours and 3 sixes. His second innings only totalled 84 runs before he was dismissed by Ian Botham. It was this innings, however, that was seen as his most brilliant of the match.Ryan (2009), p. 179. \"...\u00a084 runs and this, not his 117, was the innings to savour\u00a0...\" His 84 runs included 11 fours and 2 sixes, one of which struck the top deck of the pavilion; Hughes having stepped down the pitch to hit Chris Old back over his head. Former England captain Gubby Allen could not recall a more remarkable straight hit.Ryan (2009), p. 178. Cricket writer RS Whitington had to cast his mind back more than 40 years to describe Hughes' batting as \"the nearest approach to Stan McCabe in full flurry\".Ryan (2009), p. 179.  The Test was drawn and Hughes was given the Man of the Match award, having batted on each of the five days of the match.  His performance in the Centenary Test saw him named as one of the 1981 Wisden Cricketers of the Year."]}, {"page": "Len Hutton", "response": ["After 16 months of continuous cricket, Hutton chose to miss the 1947\u201348 winter MCC tour of the West Indies. However, injuries severely affected that team, and its captain Gubby Allen requested reinforcements. Subsequently, Hutton flew out to join the tour;Howat, pp. 74\u201375. Immediately after he arrived, having travelled for four days, Hutton played against British Guiana, scoring 138 and 62 not out,Howat, p. 75. before appearing in the third Test. After a century against Jamaica, Hutton played innings of 56 and 60 in the fourth and final Test, giving him 171 runs at an average of 42.75 in the series. He came top of the first-class averages for the tourists, with 578 runs at an average of 64.22, and was judged by Wisden as one of the few batting successes in a team which lost the four-Test series 2\u20130 and failed to win a single match on tour."]}, {"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["Selected for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1936\u201337 under the captaincy of Gubby Allen, Hammond was again part of the tour selection committee. He was successful with bat and ball, scoring 1,206 runs (average 67.00) and taking 21 wickets (average 24.57) in all first-class matches in Australia (he played two more in New Zealand at the conclusion of the tour). In Tests, Hammond scored 468 runs at an average of 58.50 and took 12 wickets at an average of 25.08. His tour began with four consecutive first-class hundreds against the state teams, but Wisden reported that he never recaptured this form during the remainder of the tour, owing to the bowling of Bill O'Reilly. Hammond could not overcome O'Reilly's use of slow leg theory in the later Tests which restricted scoring. England won the first two Tests, although Hammond did not contribute in the first, making a first ball duck. In the second he scored an unbeaten 231, then took three for 29 with the ball in Australia's second innings, during a period when the other bowlers lost control. From this point, his contributions fell away, although he believed that the best innings of his life, on one of the most difficult pitches he ever confronted, was his 32 in the third Test. Neville Cardus, who saw it, described it as remarkable. However, his free-scoring 51 in the second innings was not enough to prevent defeat in the face of an unrealistic target.Hammond, p. 128. In the fourth Test, Hammond took five for 57 in Australia's second innings, but his dismissal on the final morning by Fleetwood-Smith ensured that Australia won the match to level the series. One of Hammond's teammates opined that Bradman would not have been dismissed as easily in a similar situation.Cardus, p. 128.Gibson, p. 173. In the decisive final Test, he was restricted by O'Reilly's leg theory attack and failed in the first innings. His 56 in the second innings was not enough to prevent Australia's third win in succession to take the Ashes 3\u20132."]}, {"page": "County Championship", "response": ["| align=\"center\" | Gubby Allen"]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["Jardine had clashed with more of his team by this stage: he had argued with Gubby Allen at least twice about his refusal to bowl Bodyline (although he did bowl bouncers and fielded in the \"leg trap\", the fielders who waited for catches close in on the leg side);Douglas, p. 137.Frith, p. 116. and the Nawab of Pataudi had refused to field in the \"leg trap\", to which Jardine responded, \"I see his highness is a conscientious objector\", and subsequently allowed Pataudi to play little part in the tour.Frith, p. 118.", "Jardine insisted on strict discipline from his players but in return he went to great lengths to look after them, such as organising dental treatment or providing champagne for his tired bowlers.Gibson, pp. 158, 160. Critics praised his skill in field placing, which was sometimes interpreted as panic when he made frequent changes if the batsmen were on top. He also displayed great physical courage, such as when he was struck by a ball hard enough to draw blood on the Bodyline tour, but refused to show pain before reaching the dressing room. On the same tour, he instructed his men not to be friendly or to socialise with the Australian players;Douglas, p. 132. Gubby Allen even claimed that Jardine instructed the team to hate the Australians.Douglas, p. 123. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that Jardine made thorough preparation for games in which he was captain, studying individual batsmen at great length to find weaknesses. He had very clear plans, judged the strengths and weaknesses of his teams and knew how to get the best out of individual players. However, Robertson-Glasgow considered it a grave misjudgement to make Jardine captain of England, particularly given his known antipathy towards Australia.Frith, p. 441. Pelham Warner described how Jardine \"was a master of tactics and strategy, and was especially adept in managing fast bowlers and thereby preserving their energy. He possessed a great capacity for taking pains, which, it has been said, is the mark of a genius\u00a0... As a field tactician and selector of teams he was, I consider, surpassed by no one and equalled by few, if any.\"Warner, p. 204."]}, {"page": "Bill Voce", "response": ["The political fallout resulting from Bodyline ensured that Voce, despite taking eight wickets against the Australians in 1934, was not chosen for any of the Tests, and before the 1935 season started, Voce asked Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) not to choose him. However, in county cricket, Voce was as good a bowler as ever, and may have taken over 150 wickets in both 1935 and 1936, but for faulty catching in the slips. He declared himself available again during the latter year, and became party to the 1936/1937 tour under Gubby Allen. Bowling this time to an off-side field, Voce, after a disappointing beginning, bowled superbly in the first Test at the Gabba with six for 41 on a perfect pitch, and crushed Australia with four for sixteen, after rain, on the fifth day. England won by 322 runs, and Voce again utilised a rain-affected pitch in the second Test with match figures of seven for 76, including three wickets in four balls. After taking seventeen wickets in the inaugural two Tests, Voce did not keep up his form in the last three due to a back problem. He still finished with 26 wickets to be the leading bowler for the series."]}, {"page": "Bill Woodfull", "response": ["When play resumed, England's Gubby Allen bowled an entire over to Bradman.Frith, p. 180. As Larwood prepared to bowl his next over to Woodfull, Jardine changed to the Bodyline field setting. The capacity Saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a man when he was down.Piesse, p. 127. Journalist-cricketer Dick Whitington, wrote that Jardine's actions were seen as \"an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket\". Mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball. Whitington noted that \"[Umpire] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the English captain; Larwood, and possibly the entire side\". Some English players later expressed fears that a large-scale riot and that the police would not be able to stop the irate home crowd, who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed, from attacking them.Piesse, pp. 127\u2013128.
