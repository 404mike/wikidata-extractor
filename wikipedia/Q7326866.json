City had signed him to replace the injured Andy Morrison as they had only been able to field two central defenders (Gerard Wiekens and Richard Jobson) for most of the season. His impact on the team was immediate, his goals earning City numerous victories and ultimately promotion. As City arrived in the Premiership Prior found his first team opportunities limited as the then City manager, Joe Royle, bought Steve Howey, Richard Dunne and Paul Ritchie, while Andy Morrison also returned from his lengthy injury."]}, {"page": "Jobson", "response": ["*Richard Jobson (explorer), seventeenth-century English explorer", "*Richard Jobson (footballer) (born 1963), English", "*Richard Jobson (television presenter) (born 1960), Scottish singer-songwriter and film-maker, best known as a TV presenter"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Leeds United A.F.C. season", "response": ["|  Richard Jobson", "|  Richard Jobson"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Leeds United A.F.C. season", "response": ["Manager Howard Wilkinson knew that there were other parts of the Leeds set-up which needed reinforcements as well as the attack, and he used the 1995 close season to bring in experienced defenders Richard Jobson and Paul Beesley.
