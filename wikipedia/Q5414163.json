Authors of misogynistic messages are usually anonymous or otherwise difficult to identify. Their rhetoric involves misogynistic epithets and graphic or sexualised imagery. It centres on the women's physical appearance, and prescribes sexual violence as a corrective for the targeted women. Examples of famous women who spoke out about misogynistic attacks are Anita Sarkeesian, Laurie Penny, Caroline Criado Perez, Stella Creasy, and Lindy West."]}, {"page": "Naomi Wolf", "response": ["On December 20, 2010, Democracy Now! featured a debate between Wolf and Jaclyn Friedman on the Assange case. According to Wolf, the alleged victims should have said no, asserted that they consented to having sex with him, and said the claims were politically motivated and demeaned the cause of legitimate rape victims. In a 2011 Guardian article she argued that the accuser in rape cases should not retain anonymity. She said anonymity in such cases was \"a relic of the Victorian era\" which \"serves institutions that do not want to prosecute rapists\". She said \"this is particularly clear in the Assange case, where public opinion matters far more than usual\". Writing in The Nation, Katha Pollitt  said Wolf's argument was that anonymity \"impedes law enforcement\", which Pollitt said \"is a little bizarre: doesn\u2019t Wolf realize that anonymity applies only to the media? Everyone in the justice system knows who the complainants are.\" British feminist Laurie Penny wrote in the New Statesman in September 2012 that \"Wolf has done great damage by using her platform as one of the world\u2019s most famous feminists to dismiss these women\u2019s allegations.\""]}, {"page": "Hay-on-Wye", "response": ["Past speakers at the festival have included Noam Chomsky, Brian Eno, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Philip Pullman, Diane Abbott, Steven Pinker and Laurie Penny, among others.
