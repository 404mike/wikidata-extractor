Between 1919 and 1927 Waddington made 255 appearances for Yorkshire, and in all first-class cricket played 266 matches. In these games, he took a total of 852 wickets with his left arm fast-medium bowling. Capable of making the ball swing, Waddington was admired for the aesthetic quality of his bowling action. He was a hostile bowler who sometimes sledged opposing batsmen and questioned umpires' decisions, behaviour which was unusual during his playing days.\nWaddington first played for Yorkshire after the First World War, when the team had been weakened by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the County Championship that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920\u201321 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared in two of the five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in an unfamiliar tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against Middlesex. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business, a fat-refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket.\nIn the early 1920s, Waddington played several football matches for Halifax Town as a goalkeeper, and after his retirement from cricket enjoyed some success as an amateur golfer. He was in trouble with the police on more than one occasion and after the Second World War was charged with defrauding his wartime employers, the Ministry of Food; he was found not guilty. He died in 1959 at the age of 66.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Abe Waddington"]}, {"page": "Hedley Verity", "response": ["Bradman wrote in an obituary: \"I cannot ever recall hearing Verity utter a word of complaint or criticism ... if reports of his final sacrifice be correct ... he maintained this example right to the end.\" When first-class cricket resumed in 1945, Yorkshire staged a memorial match for Verity against Lancashire at Bradford Park Avenue, which resulted in a draw. Later, several Yorkshire players visited his grave; some members of the MCC team under Len Hutton's captaincy in 1954\u201355, including Hutton, journalists and former Yorkshire player Abe Waddington paid tribute there while en route for Australia.Hill, p. 153."]}, {"page": "Clayton, West Yorkshire", "response": ["Clayton was the birthplace and home of Albert Pierrepoint, Great Britain's last state executioner, he held the position until 1956. His father Henry Albert Pierrepoint, born in Clayton in 1876, was also a state executioner.  Abe Waddington was born in Clayton on 4 February 1893 and was a bowler in the English cricket team from 1920 to 1921."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Dobson", "response": ["Dobson was born in Barrow upon Trent, Derbyshire, the son of Frederick William Dobson and his wife Agnes Eadie. He played three County Cricket matches for Derbyshire in May 1920. In the first game against Yorkshire, he was stumped for a duck in his first innings and bowled by two-time Test cricketer Abe Waddington in the second. In 1923 he played a minor counties game for Staffordshire. Finally he played two games in the 1925 season, for Warwickshire. Dobson was a tailend batsman and an occasional bowler."]}, {"page": "Birmingham and District Premier League", "response": ["* Abe Waddington West Bromwich Dartmouth"]}, {"page": "Major Booth", "response": ["On 1 July 1916 he went \"over the top\" near La Cigny on the Somme while serving with the 15th (Service) Battalion, the West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own), also known as \"The Leeds Pals\". He was followed a short while later by another wave of soldiers among whom was Abe Waddington (later also Yorkshire and England). Waddington was hit and found himself in a shell hole near Serre with Booth, who was also injured, and held him until he died. Booth's body then remained there until the spring, when he was buried at Serre Road No 1 Cemetery.National Army Museum \u2013 Combat cricketers "]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Abe Waddington \u00b7"]}, {"page": "George Macaulay", "response": ["In 1924, Macaulay further increased his total of wickets to 190 and lowered his bowling average to 13.23, placing him first in the national averages.Woodhouse, p. 333. His batting declined as he scored 395 runs at an average of 11.96. Although selected for another Test trial,  Macaulay did not play in the series against the touring South African team until the third Test at Leeds, where he took one wicket in each South African innings, but was omitted from the final two Tests. Despite his success in the season, he was not chosen to tour Australia with the MCC that winter, even though Maurice Tate, the leading bowler on the tour, lacked support. Macaulay had been involved in controversy on the field in 1924. At the time, the Yorkshire team were notorious for their aggressive attitude while fielding.Hill, p. 106. In a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield, the hostility of the crowd provoked an MCC inquiry which found that Yorkshire bowler Abe Waddington had incited the spectators.Hill, pp. 106\u201307. Further incidents followed against Surrey.Hill, p. 107. The editor of Wisden blamed Yorkshire's poor discipline on a small group of approximately four players. Without naming Macaulay as one of them, he noted that Lord Hawke, the Yorkshire president, believed Macaulay should have been in the team to Australia, and that \"it was entirely his own fault he was not chosen\". It is also possible that during a match at this time, Macaulay openly criticised the captaincy and bowling of Arthur Gilligan, the England captain.Marshall, p. 106. Marshall claims that the incident took place in the 1924 Lord's Test, but Macaulay did not play in that game."]}, {"page": "Waddington (surname)", "response": ["* Abe Waddington (1893\u20131959), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1920\u201321", "response": ["* Abe Waddington, Yorkshire"]}]}}
