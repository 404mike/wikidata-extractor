In 1981, theorist Robert Laughlin proposed a theory explaining the unanticipated precision of the integral plateau.  It also implied that the Hall conductance is proportional to a topological invariant, called Chern number, whose relevance for the band structure of solids was formulated by David J. Thouless and collaborators. Shortly after, in 1982, Horst St\u00f6rmer and Daniel Tsui observed the fractional quantum Hall effect where the conductance was now a rational multiple of the constant e^2/h. Laughlin, in 1983, realized that this was a consequence of quasiparticle interaction in the Hall states and formulated a variational method solution, named the Laughlin wavefunction. The study of topological properties of the fractional Hall effect remains an active field of research. Decades later, the aforementioned topological band theory advanced by David J. Thouless and collaborators was further expanded leading to the discovery of topological insulators. "]}, {"page": "1934", "response": ["** David J.
