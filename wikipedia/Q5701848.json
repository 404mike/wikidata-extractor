The English actress was twenty-two years his junior, and better known by her stage name, Helen Barry. The day before that marriage, however, Rolls appeared before officials of the Diocese of London. His address at that time was the Parish of Saint George, Hanover Square, Middlesex. Rolls signed an affidavit that his fianc\u00e9e had married Joseph Brandon on 3 May 1855 (at age fifteen) at the Parish Church of Saint Luke, Charlton, Kent. He also acknowledged that, on 2 June 1870, the marriage had been dissolved at Westminster, upon the petition of Joseph Brandon, with the divorce finalised on 29 February 1876. The marriage between Rolls and Barry (as Helen Elizabeth Brandon) was registered in the third quarter of 1877, with the ceremony performed on 1 September at the Parish Church of St Mark at Regent's Park in Middlesex.", "Actress Helen Barry was born Elizabeth Short on 5 January 1840 in Lee, Kent, England, the daughter of Charles Henry Short and his wife Mary.

Elizabeth began acting as Helen Barry in 1872, after her divorce, and after her daughter Esther had been put out as an apprentice. Helen Barry first appeared in Babil and Bijou at the Covent Garden Theatre. The actress also performed in The Happy Land at the Court Theatre, and Arkwright's Wife at the Leeds Theatre Royal and, following its move, London's Globe Theatre.

His widow moved to the United States following his death, where she appeared in theatrical performances in New York City. Less than one year after her second husband's death, Barry was married and widowed again.

In England, he painted reproductions of his Western landscapes (which were much in demand) as well as scenes around London, in Cornwall, and in Scotland. In France, he painted numerous landscapes along the Seine River and in the Barbizon region. At the instigation of John Ruskin, he also painted some 50 canvases of Venice; these are more vividly colored and looser in their brushwork than most of his earlier work. In general, his European paintings are more atmospheric than his landscapes of the American West, showing the influence of J. M. W. Turner as well as of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and other painters of the Barbizon School. The European period saw the height of Munger's success and fame, with some of his paintings selling for substantial sums in the $1000\u20135000 range ($20,000\u2013120,000 today). He was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in France and awarded medals by the governments of Germany, Russia, and Belgium. He even took a side trip into writing, turning out a three-act comedy, Madelaine Marston, that was produced at the Theatre Royal in London in 1886 with Helen Barry in the cast."]}, {"page": "Constantin de Grimm", "response": ["Helen Barry in Life and Love.jpg|Actress Helen Barry, 1889"]}, {"page": "Amy Busby", "response": ["Amy Busby went to New York City as a teenager, hoping for a career on the stage.
