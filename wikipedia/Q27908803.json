It was founded by Mabel Barltrop (1866-1934) in 1919 at 12 Albany Road, Bedford. A clergyman's widow, Barltrop declared herself the 'daughter of God', took the name Octavia and believed herself to be the Shiloh of Southcott's prophecies. Barltrop had originally heard of Southcott via a leaflet written by Alice Seymour. She and 12 apostles founded the Society, originally called the Community of the Holy Ghost.", "During the 1930s the membership began to dwindle as did Alice Seymour's smaller rival group."]}]}}
