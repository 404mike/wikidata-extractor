According to Adam Zamoyski, such expressions \"were, and to some extent still are, common currency in Polish and carry no greater implication than the 'love concluding letters today. \"The spirit of the times, pervaded by the Romantic movement in art and literature, favoured extreme expression of feeling\u00a0... Whilst the possibility cannot be ruled out entirely, it is unlikely that the two were ever lovers.\" Chopin's biographer Alan Walker considers that, insofar as such expressions could be perceived as homosexual in nature, they would not denote more than a passing phase in Chopin's life. The musicologist Jeffrey Kallberg notes that concepts of sexual practice and identity were very different in Chopin's time, so modern interpretation is problematic.", "Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France, he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole."]}, {"page": "Szlachta", "response": ["Adam Zamoyski argues that the szlachta were not exactly the same as the European nobility nor a gentry, as the szlachta fundamentally differed in law, rights, political power, origin, and composition from the feudal nobility of Western Europe. Feudalism never took root in Poland. The szlachta did not rank below the king, as the szlachta's relationship to the Polish king was not feudal. The szlachta stood as equals before the king. The king was not an autocrat, nor the szlachta's overlord, as szlachta land was in allodium, not feudal tenure. Feudal dependence upon a Polish king did not exist for the szlachta and earlier in history some high-ranking szlachta (magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms and constantly sought to undermine Piast authority.", "Others assert the szlachta were not a social class, but a caste, among them, historian Adam Zamoyski,"]}, {"page": "Polish contribution to World War II", "response": ["* Adam Zamoyski: The Forgotten Few: The Polish Air Force in the Second World War, Pen & Sword Books, 2004, ."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Adam Zamoyski (born 1949), Napoleonic era"]}, {"page": "The Queen's College, Oxford", "response": ["* Adam Zamoyski, historian and author"]}, {"page": "List of Polish people", "response": ["* Adam Zamoyski"]}, {"page": "Grande Arm\u00e9e", "response": ["* 1812: Napoleon's Fatal March on Moscow, Adam Zamoyski, ", "* 1812: Napoleon's Fatal March on Moscow(2004), Adam Zamoyski, Harper Collins Publishing, "]}, {"page": "Sanation", "response": ["Named after the Latin word for \"healing\" (\"sanatio\"),Neither the English \"sanation\" nor the cognate Polish \"sanacja\"\u2014both derived from the same Latin root, \"sanatio\"\u2014has much currency in its respective language.

He later wrote that in the spring of 1919 he \"was disappointed when he [Lloyd George] gave way (in part) on the Russian question in order to buy French consent to concessions to Germany\".Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 30 In 1919, Carr was part of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference and was involved in the drafting of parts of the Treaty of Versailles relating to the League of Nations. During the conference, Carr was much offended at the Allied, especially French, treatment of the Germans, writing that the German delegation at the peace conference were \"cheated over the 'Fourteen Points', and subjected to every petty humiliation\". Beside working on the sections of the Versailles treaty relating to the League of Nations, Carr was also involved in working out the borders between Germany and Poland. Initially, Carr favoured Poland, urging in a memo in February 1919 that Britain recognise Poland at once, and that the German city of Danzig (modern Gda\u0144sk, Poland) be ceded to Poland.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 28 In March 1919, Carr fought against the idea of a Minorities Treaty for Poland, arguing that the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in Poland would be best guaranteed by not involving the international community in Polish internal affairs.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 27 By the spring of 1919, Carr's relations with the Polish delegation had declined to a state of mutual hostility.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 29 Carr's tendency to favour the claims of the Germans at the expense of the Poles led Adam Zamoyski to note that Carr \"held views of the most extraordinary racial arrogance on all of the nations of Eastern Europe\".Zamoyski, Adam The Polish Way, London: John Murray, 1989 p. 335 Carr's biographer, Jonathan Haslam, wrote that Carr grew up in a place where German culture was deeply appreciated, which in turn always coloured his views towards Germany throughout his life. As a result, Carr supported the territorial claims of the Reich against Poland. In a letter written in 1954 to his friend Isaac Deutscher, Carr described his attitude to Poland at the time: \"The picture of Poland that was universal in Eastern Europe right down to 1925 was of a strong and potentially predatory power.\""]}, {"page": "Adam (given name)", "response": ["* Adam Zamoyski (born 1949), English historian"]}, {"page": "List of fictional monarchs of real nations", "response": ["** In the story What If Napoleon Triumphs In Russia by Adam Zamoyski, after the French Empire's victory over Russia and Alexander I's flight from Pskov to a remote monastery, Grand Duke Constantine was installed by Napoleon as Tsar on 15 August 1813.
