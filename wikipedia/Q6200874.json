Moreton (22 September 1891 \u2013 August 1942) was a football player and manager. He joined Tranmere Rovers from Cammell Laird in July 1910. He was switched from right-half to outside right, where he set up countless goals for a succession of Tranmere centre forwards, including Dixie Dean, in almost 500 appearances at the club.Upon retirement, aged 37, Moreton became trainer alongside manager Bert Cooke, before taking over as manager himself, from 1939, during World War II. He died in 1942, and was succeeded by another former player, Bill Ridding.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1924\u201325 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["Nelson began their league campaign on 30 August 1924 with an away match at Southport, who had ended the previous season in seventh position. New signings Billy Bottrill, Bill Ellerington and Joseph O'Beirne went straight into the starting line-up but they could not prevent Southport winning by a single goal from Jack Barber,  giving them their first ever League win against Nelson. A week later, Nelson played their first home game of the season, in which James Phizacklea made his debut for the club. A crowd of around 6,000 saw Ashington beaten 4\u20130 thanks to goals from Bottrill, Joe Eddleston, Jack Newnes and Sid Hoad. Three days later, Eddleston scored twice as Doncaster Rovers were defeated by three goals to nil in the first midweek match of the campaign. However, Nelson could not continue their winning streak as they lost 0\u20132 against Accrington Stanley at Peel Park in the following fixture. On 16 September, Nelson achieved their biggest victory in the Football League at that time with a 7\u20131 win over Durham City at Seedhill. The game saw Eddleston score his first hat-trick since the 3\u20130 victory away at Rochdale in January 1923, and O'Beirne and Eddie Cameron score their first goals of the season. Four days later, Nelson suffered their third consecutive defeat away from home, losing 0\u20133 to Barrow at Holker Street. The team continued their good home form the following week with a narrow win against Lincoln City. Nelson named the same team for the seventh game in succession for the trip to Tranmere Rovers on 4 October, but the side were beaten for the fourth straight away match thanks to goals from Dixie Dean and Jimmy Moreton."]}, {"page": "List of Tranmere Rovers F.C. players", "response": ["Jimmy Moreton made 148 Football League and 22 FA Cup appearances, as well numerous first-team outings in the lower Lancashire Combination and Central Leagues.
