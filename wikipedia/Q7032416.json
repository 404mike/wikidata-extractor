Clarissa Tan from The Spectator said Paxman presented \"with assuredness and gravitas\". Hugo Rifkind, another journalist for The Times, said: \"Documentaries must cater for those who know lots and those who know nothing. Jeremy Paxman gets the balance right\". John Crace writing in The Guardian described the series as disconnected. He went on to describe it as if there was a contextual void at the centre. It wasn't that the series demanded a great historical debate on the causes of the war \u2013 though it did seem perverse that the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the Balkans or European imperialism didn't get a mention. However Nigel H. Jones, writing for The Daily Telegraph, commented on how moving the series was, defying his low expectations."]}]}}
