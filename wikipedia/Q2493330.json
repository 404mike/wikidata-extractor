The thought of war terrifies her, as she knows it will eventually take away her son David. He, however, is determined to enlist, which she vigorously resists, going so far as to falsify their ration card so the government does not know they have a son and asking Dr. Campbell to lie that David's childhood asthma is more serious than it really is. When David sneaks out in the middle of the night to enlist, Miriam is heartbroken and takes her anguish out on both her husband and Spencer Wilson, a conscientious objector. She also goes several days without sleep, writing letters to soldiers on the front and preparing care packages whilst shutting out her husband. Frances Barden, upon reading the letters - which are not at all encouraging or even positive - takes Miriam to task for her behavior, and they reconcile, though Miriam's antagonizing of Spencer continues.  When a telegram comes to the house, Miriam fears for the worst and hides it in a sudden fit of panic. Bryn finds the telegram and advises her to open it. Miriam is very happy to learn that David is only reported missing and not officially dead. In the Series 1 finale, Miriam finds she is pregnant and is utterly thrilled at the thought that David will get a brother or sister."]}, {"page": "List of Marathi films of 2004", "response": ["|Ek Sagar Kinaree...||Laxmikant Shetgaonkar||Claire Price, Dhanu Dicholkar, Gopikant Shirodkar || ||National Film Development Corporation of India, Gomantak Marathi Academy || ||"]}, {"page": "The Whistle-Blower (TV series)", "response": ["* Claire Price as Emily Shearer"]}]}}
