During World War II he and the Road Research Laboratory were involved in important war work, developing temporary runways, beach analysis, and tank and aircraft design. He also worked on the explosives calculations and scale models used to develop the bouncing bombs used in the Dam Busters Raid.\nHe was widely recognised for his contributions to engineering and, amongst a string of professional awards, was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and knighted.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Dam Busters (film)", "response": ["* Colin Tapley as Dr William Glanville, director of Road Research, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research"]}, {"page": "Bouncing bomb", "response": ["A.R. Collins was among a large number of other people besides Barnes Wallis who made wide-ranging contributions to the development of a bouncing bomb and its method of delivery to a target, to the extent that, in a paper published in 1982, Collins himself made it evident that Wallis \"did not play an all-important role in the development of this project and in particular, that very significant contributions were made by, for example, Sir William Glanville, Dr. G. Charlesworth, Dr. A.R. Collins and others of the Road Research Laboratory\".Quotation from Johnson (1998), pp. 29\u201331, citing Collins, A.R., \"The origins and design of the attack on the German dams\", in Proceedings \u2013 Institution of Civil Engineers. Part 2. Research and theory, 73, 1982. However, the modification of a Vickers Wellington bomber, the design of which Wallis himself had contributed to, for work in early testing of his proposed weapon, has been cited as an example of how Wallis \"would have been the first to acknowledge\" the contributions of others.Flower (2002), p. 19. Also, in the words of Eric Allwright, who worked in the Drawing Office for Vickers Armstrongs at the time, \"Wallis was trying to do his ordinary job [for Vickers Armstrongs] as well as all this \u2013 he was out at the Ministry and down to Fort Halstead and everywhere\"; Wallis's pressing of his papers, ideas and ongoing developments on relevant authorities helped ensure that development continued; Wallis was principal designer of the models, prototypes and \"live\" versions of the weapon; and, perhaps most significantly, it was Wallis who explained the weapon in the final briefing for RAF crews before they set off on Operation Chastise, to use one of his designs in action.Flower (2002), e.g. pp. 30, 42, and Sweetman (2002), (Parts 1 & 2)."]}, {"page": "Transport Research Laboratory", "response": ["During the Second World War, the Laboratory contributed to the war effort.

The results were disappointing; bullets went straight through the soft material and through a mild steel backing plate. Disappointed, some of the scientists witnessing the tests left. William Glanville, head of the station, stayed and the men performed a few more test shots. In the resulting discussions, Terrell suggested replacing the cork with rock to deflect the hard core of an armour-piercing bullet so that it hit the backing plate at an angle, dispersing its energy so that it would not penetrate."]}, {"page": "List of structural engineers", "response": ["* William Glanville"]}, {"page": "Colin Tapley", "response": ["He returned briefly to New Zealand before returning once again to Britain to renew his acting career.  His most famous role is as William Glanville in The Dam Busters (1955), but he spent much of his later career  typecast as a police inspector, a role he played in several films and TV series before retiring to Gloucestershire.", "After demobilisation in 1945, Tapley married, Patricia Hambro Lyon, whom he had met during the war, and returned to his native New Zealand for the first time since 1933. He soon tired of life in New Zealand and returned to Hollywood to re-establish his film career. Legendary American film director and Academy Award-winning film producer Cecil B. DeMille personally gave him a role in his new film, Samson and Delilah, which Tapley accepted, playing the part of a prince. Shortly after finishing Samson and Delilah, Tapley and Patsy, finding that Hollywood had changed for the worse, returned to Britain. Due to Tapley's upper class accent he had no difficulty finding work in the film industry; it was also the boom period of British war films in the '50s and '60s and he landed the role of a lifetime, the revered war epic The Dam Busters film of 1955 where alongside Michael Redgrave he played William Glanville who helped to develop the famous bouncing bomb. From 1954 to 1958, he appeared as a police inspector named Parker, working with his good friend Donald Gray, in the detective television series The Vise (later known as Saber of London).
