Pat Kelly worked with her husband, Harry Kelly, an insurance clerk, and began climbing in 1914.  One of her most best known achievements was to climb solo Owen Glynne Jones's route up Scafell pinnacle from Deep Ghyll in the Lake District.  She encouraged many women to climb and founded the Pinnacle Club, the first rock-climbing club for solely women, at Pen-y-Gwryd in north Wales on 26 March 1921.  A year later she was mortally injured in a climbing accident on 17 April 1922 at Tryfan, north Wales, and died from head injuries on 26 April.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of climbers and mountaineers", "response": ["* Pat Kelly (died 1922) UK, rock climber and founder of Pinnacle Club"]}, {"page": "Pat Kelly", "response": ["Pat Kelly may refer to:", "*Pat Kelly (American football) (1965\u20132003), former NFL tight end", "*Pat Kelly (Australian footballer) (1923\u20131999), Australian rules footballer", "*Pat Kelly (catcher) (born 1955), former Major League Baseball catcher", "*Pat Kelly (climber) (1873\u20131922), early female climber and founder of the Pinnacle Club", "*Pat Kelly (comedian), Canadian comedian and former children's television personality", "*Pat Kelly (Gaelic footballer) (born 1981), Mayo and St Vincents footballer", "*Pat Kelly (infielder) (born 1967), former Major League Baseball infielder", "*Pat Kelly (musician) (1944\u20132019), reggae singer", "*Pat Kelly (outfielder) (1944\u20132005), American right fielder in Major League Baseball", "*Pat Kelly (politician) (born c. 1971), Canadian politician", "*Pat Kelly (speed skater) (born 1962), Canadian ice speed skater", "*Pat Kelly (trade unionist) (1929\u20132004), New Zealand trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Martha Emily Kelly", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pat Kelly  (climber) "]}, {"page": "Pinnacle Club", "response": ["The Club was officially inaugurated on March 26, 1921 at a meeting in the Pen y Gwryd Inn, which still stands today just below Pen y Pass in Snowdonia.
