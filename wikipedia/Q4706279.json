The film was produced by Twentieth Century Fox, and filmed entirely in North Wales and England.", "A film based on her life, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, was released in 1958. It drew from the book The Small Woman, by Alan Burgess. Although she found herself a figure of international interest due to the popularity of the film, and television and media interviews, Aylward was mortified by her depiction in the film and the liberties it took. The tall (1.75m/5' 9\"), blonde, Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman was inconsistent with Aylward's small stature, dark hair and North London accent. The struggles of Aylward and her family to effect her initial trip to China were disregarded in favour of a movie plot device of an employer \"condescending to write to 'his old friend' Jeannie Lawson.\" Also, Aylward's dangerous, complicated travels across Russia, China and Japan were reduced to, \"a few rude soldiers\", after which, \"Hollywood's train delivered her neatly to Tientsin.\" Many characters and place names were changed, even when these names had significant meaning, such as those of her adopted children and the name of the inn, named instead for the Chinese belief in the number 8 as being auspicious. For example, in real life she was given the Chinese name  (\u00c0i W\u011bi D\u00e9- a Chinese approximation to 'Aylward' \u2013 meaning 'Virtuous One'), but in the film she was given the name  Jen-Ai,( pronounced- Zhen-Ai, meaning \"true love\").Cast Script. British Film Institute. Colonel Linnan was portrayed as half-European, a change which she found insulting to his real Chinese lineage, and she felt her reputation was damaged by the Hollywood-embellished love scenes in the film. Not only had she never kissed a man, but the film's ending portrayed her character leaving the orphans to re-join the colonel elsewhere, even though in reality she did not retire from working with orphans until she was 60 years old. She dedicated her life to the orphans in Taiwan, and was buried in Taipei. Her ministry continues to develop, and is now called Bethany Children's Home in Taipei, http://bethany.org.tw/. The new director, Sharon Chiang, \u6c5f\u79c0\u5708, is called from Seattle Washington to further develop Bethany Children's Home for its new vision and new building.

As night fell, those allocated a place moved to Hut 104. Unfortunately for the prisoners, the exit trap door of Harry was frozen solid and freeing it delayed the escape for an hour and a half. Then it was discovered that the tunnel had come up short of the nearby forest; at 10.30 p.m. the first man out emerged just short of the tree line close to a guard tower. (According to Alan Burgess, in his book The Longest Tunnel, the tunnel reached the forest, as planned, but the first few trees were too sparse to provide adequate cover). As the temperature was below freezing and there was snow on the ground, a dark trail would be created by crawling to cover. To avoid being seen by the sentries, the escapes were reduced to about ten per hour, rather than the one every minute that had been planned. Word was eventually sent back that no-one issued with a number above 100 would be able to get away before daylight. As they would be shot if caught trying to return to their own barracks, these men changed back into their own uniforms and got some sleep. An air raid then caused the camp's (and the tunnel's) electric lighting to be shut down, slowing the escape even more. At around 1 a.m., the tunnel collapsed and had to be repaired."]}, {"page": "Leo Genn", "response": ["* 1954 Jungle Green dramatised & produced by Alan Burgess from the book by Arthur Campbell, BBC"]}, {"page": "Operation Daybreak", "response": ["Operation Daybreak (also known as The Price of Freedom in the U.S.)IMDb: Release dates for Operation: Daybreak Retrieved 2013-01-22 is a 1975 World War II film based on the true story of Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of SS general Reinhard Heydrich in Prague.
