The Bell machine was pushed by horses. A few Bell machines were available in the United States. In 1835, in the United States, Hiram Moore built and patented the first combine harvester, which was capable of reaping, threshing and winnowing cereal grain. Early versions were pulled by horse, mule or ox teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version with a length of 5.2\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft) and a cut width of 4.57\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft); by 1839, over  of crops were harvested. This combine harvester was pulled by 20 horses fully handled by farmhands. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting, or swathe, width of several metres were used on American farms.A parallel development in Australia saw the development of the stripper based on the Gallic stripper, by John Ridley and others in South Australia by 1843. The stripper only gathered the heads, leaving the stems in the field. The stripper and later headers had the advantage of fewer moving parts and only collecting heads, requiring less power to operate. Refinements by Hugh Victor McKay produced a commercially successful combine harvester in 1885, the Sunshine Header-Harvester.Timesonline.co.uk, access date 31-09-2009"]}, {"page": "History of Adelaide", "response": ["John Ridley invented a reaping machine in 1843 which changed farming methods throughout South Australia and the nation at large.

Ridley was born on 2 May 1839 in Houghton Le Spring, Durham, England to parents John Ridley (1806\u20131887) and Mary White Pybus (1807\u20131884). At her birth, she had an older sister Mary Elizabeth Ridley who was born in 1836. When Annie was three months old her family moved to Hindmarsh, South Australia, Australia. Her father wanted to help colonize Australia and help make a great settlement. After a six-month voyage on the boat called the Warrior, the Ridley family arrived at Port Adelaide in Australia. From there they proceeded a few miles to Hindmarsh where they lived in a mud house while a wooden one was being constructed. Soon their new home was built with a fireplace, kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, and an office. However, three tragic events occurred. First, the oldest daughter, Mary Elizabeth, went too close to the fireplace and her clothes caught on fire. She died hours later from the severe Burns. Next, Mrs. Ridley gave birth to another daughter but that daughter died months later. Lastly, a son was born and he died soon after. This causes Annie to grow up without many Children her age.", "Her father, John Ridley, planned to have his daughter learn through nature before ever picking up a book.

Ultimately, his plan ended two years early when Annie found herself wandering into a school near by her house and joining the class. This occurred when Annie was five years old marking the beginning of her schooling. Then at the age of twelve, Annie fell in love with reading after discovering Alfred Tennyson's poem The Princess. This poem inspired her then and in life to promote women's education.", "In 1884, Annie's mother Mary White Pybus died.
