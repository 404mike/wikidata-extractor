According to the literary critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a \"structured social ritual \u2013 the marriage market represented by the London season\" where \"all are in danger of ostracism for inappropriate behavior\".Mussell (1984), p. 413. Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of Jane Austen, whose novels were set in the same era. Austen's works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work A Natural History of the Romance Novel, because Heyer's stories took place amidst events that had occurred more than 100\u00a0years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it.Regis (2003), pp. 125\u2013126. Whilst Austen could ignore the \"minutiae of dress and decor\", Heyer included those details \"to invest the novels\u00a0... with 'the tone of the time'\".Robinson (1978), p. 323. Later reviewers, such as Lillian Robinson, criticized Heyer's \"passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance\",Robinson (1978), p. 326. and Marghanita Laski wrote that \"these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen\u00a0... referred to only when she wanted to show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous\".Laski (1970), p. 284. Others, including A.S. Byatt, believe that Heyer's \"awareness of this atmosphere \u2013 both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced \u2013 is her greatest asset\".Byatt (1969), p. 275."]}, {"page": "Religious ecstasy", "response": ["Although the experience is usually brief in time,Marghanita Laski, Ecstasy.

She noted that Kipling was a friend of the founder of the Scout Movement, Robert Baden-Powell, who based the junior scout \"Wolf Cubs\" on the stories, and that Kipling admired the movement. Ricketts wrote that Kipling was obsessed by rules, a theme running throughout the stories and named explicitly as \"the law of the jungle\". Part of this, Ricketts supposed, was Mrs Holloway's evangelicalism, suitably transformed. The rules required obedience and \"knowing your place\", but also provided social relationships and \"freedom to move between different worlds\". Sandra Kemp observed that the law may be highly codified, but that the energies are also lawless, embodying the part of human nature which is \"floating, irresponsible and self-absorbed\". There is a duality between the two worlds of the village and the jungle, but Mowgli, like Mang the bat, can travel between the two."]}, {"page": "Fanny Hill", "response": ["Luxor Press published a 9/6 edition in January 1964, using text \"exactly the same as that employed for the de-luxe edition\" in 1963.

The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter to focus on their more profitable magazines, and they made plans to close down both Science Fantasy and New Worlds.  After hearing of these plans, Moorcock and Warburton began to consider forming a separate company to continue publishing New Worlds, and Brian Aldiss contacted well-known literary figures such as J.B. Priestley, Kingsley Amis, Marghanita Laski, and Angus Wilson to gain support for an application for a grant from the British Arts Council in late 1966.  In early January 1967 Aldiss discovered that the grant application would be successful, and that New Worlds would be awarded \u00a3150 per issue, though in the event the grant certification was delayed until at least May.Greenland, Entropy Exhibition, pp.\u00a019\u201320.  The grant was enough to enable the magazine to continue, though it would not cover all costs.  A publisher still had to be found, and both Fontana and Panther Books expressed an interest, but the promise of the money and the prestige of an Arts Council grant convinced Warburton to stay involved personally.  While these negotiations were going on, two more issues were assembled from backfile material and donated stories.  Roberts & Vinter had ceased to exist by this time, so a sister company, Gold Star Publications, became the publisher for both these issues, with Warburton and Aldiss providing Gold Star with personal financial guarantees.Ashley, Transformations, pp.\u00a0245\u2013248.  These two issues appeared in March and April 1967, but the latter was mistakenly also dated March in the indicia.  Science Fantasy, which by this time had been retitled SF Impulse, was not continued but was merged with New Worlds as of the first Gold Star issue, though nothing of SF Impulses design or content was visible in New Worlds."]}, {"page": "Sheila Kaye-Smith", "response": ["Kaye-Smith's later books increasingly reflected her personal religious preoccupations, featuring characters tussling with spiritual crises and conversions within subtle discussions of the differences among Anglicanism, Anglo-Catholicism, and Catholicism. Her plots (e.g. in The Lardners and the Laurelwoods, A Valiant Woman, and Mrs Gailey) continued to reflect pre- and post-WW2 preoccupations of women's \"middle-brow\" fiction of the time. She explored national anxieties about social class, divorce, and women's \"role\", within a mainly rural but rapidly modernising milieu (Pearce, 2004, 2005).
