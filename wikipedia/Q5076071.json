Charles Campbell won eight Scottish Cup winners medals with Queen's and earned 13 Scotland caps. Wattie Arnott was a near ever-present in the successful teams of the 1880s. Robert Smyth McColl scored a remarkable number of goals for Queen's and soon moved on to Newcastle United and Rangers. In an unprecedented move, he returned to Queen's and scored six goals in his final match. Andrew Watson was the first black football player in Britain. He won three Scotland caps and starred in one of the club's earliest sides. J.A.H Catton, a notable sports editor, named Watson in his all-time Scotland team in 1926.Catton, J.A.H.

Having been born in 1951, Jordan was the second youngest of the 2005 inductees, behind the then Rangers manager Alex McLeish, born in 1959, and with the oldest being Charles Campbell, born \"circa 1850s\". Honouring the \"truly great players, managers and officials who have reached the pinnacle of their profession and have made a significant contribution to Scotland's football reputation through their skill, spirit and determination\", the induction followed the inaugural 20 Hall of Fame entrants, inducted in November 2004. Citing his \"highly successful career at club level\" at Leeds, Manchester United and Milan, the Hall of Fame stated Joe would probably be best remembered for his crucial 1973 World Cup qualifying goal against Czechoslovakia."]}]}}
