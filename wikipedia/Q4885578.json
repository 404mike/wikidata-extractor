A sell-out crowd witnessed a tight one-point victory in favour of the Giants, winning 85\u201384, with James Jones posting 29 points for the home team. The following week, a convincing 99\u201387 victory at home to Sheffield Sharks meant Giants had opened the season with a 100% record, however their form soon dipped as the new team recorded only one win in the subsequent 12 games. Former Great Britain Under-23 international Ben Eaves was signed at the end of October in a bid to improve Giants' fledgling squad, whilst a deal to sign long-term target Nick George was eventually agreed in December. The team's form gradually started to improve throughout the winter with victories against Durham Wildcats, local rivals Cheshire Phoenix and Mersey Tigers, as well as back-to-back home wins over title-chasing Surrey Heat in January and February 2013. It was announced on 19 February that Nick George had departed the club after making only six appearances. Giants continued with their resurgent form in a bid for a top-eight finish and a place in the end-of-season Play-offs, taking it down to the penultimate game of the regular season. However an 85\u201387 home defeat to fellow Play-off chasers London Lions \u2013 despite a heroic comeback from the Giants who were down 19 points at the start of the fourth quarter \u2013 saw Lions take eighth-place and the final Play-off spot, consigning Giants to a ninth-place finish in their rookie season."]}, {"page": "Eaves (surname)", "response": ["* Ben Eaves (born 1982), American ice hockey player", "* Ben Eaves (basketball) (born 1987), British basketball player"]}, {"page": "Ben Eaves", "response": ["During the SM-liiga playoffs 2009 Ben Eaves broke the record of Kari Jalonen (season 1980/81) and Hannes Hyv\u00f6nen (2007/08) for the most points scored during the playoffs (21 points).
