Assange had lost legal appeals against his extradition to Sweden where he was wanted for questioning about alleged sexual assault and rape, but while within the embassy he was on diplomatic territory and beyond the reach of the British police. The United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office delivered a note to the Ecuadorian government in Quito reminding them of the provisions of the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 which allow the British government to withdraw recognition of diplomatic protection from embassies; the move was interpreted as a hostile act by Ecuador, with Foreign Minister Ricardo Pati\u00f1o stating that this \"explicit threat\" would be met with \"appropriate responses in accordance with international law\". Assange was granted diplomatic asylum on August 16, 2012, with Foreign Minister Pati\u00f1o stating that Assange's fears of political persecution were \"legitimate\".

The nearly 30,000 tonne tanker and its 23 crew members were surrounded by 4 vessels and 1 helicopter. Many think this was in retaliation of the UK boarding an Iranian Supertanker, the Grace 1, at Gibraltar earlier in July due to suspicions of smuggling oil to Syria. As of today, the tanker has been moved to the port of Bander Abbas and the ship's owners have not been able to contact the tanker. The British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt has said that Iran will suffer serious consequences if the tanker is not released. The British diplomatic effort is being supported by American President Donald Trump and both French and German foreign ministries. UK ships are urged to stay away from the strait and the result of this is an increase in oil prices around the world.
