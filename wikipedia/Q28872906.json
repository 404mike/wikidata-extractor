In this book she made the assertion that her reported testimony before the Warren Commission was fabricated by the commission, a claim also made by others about Warren Commission testimony. Others point out that those claims cannot be verified one way or the other, and argue that the Warren Commission did not fabricate testimony at all, although some people who probably committed perjury point to the possibility of an internal conspiracy.", "Jean Hill adamantly rejected the Warren Commission's single gunman findings and was sure, based on what she saw the day of the assassination and on her experience afterward, that there was a conspiracy.", "According to Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, changes in Hill's story over time led some researchers of the Kennedy assassination to consider Hill a \"controversial witness\". Others argue that her testimony was both reliable and that \"the strong patriotic convictions that bound Jean Hill to defy the official report of the Warren Commission\", and the fact that \"she received no compensation, and a lifetime of woe\"Pag\u00e1n 2004 p.67 add significant credibility to her testimony and also at the same time call into deeper question the conduct of some officials on the day of the assassination and in the investigation that followed. The controversy over Hill's testimony continues as a part of the larger debate and ongoing research into the Kennedy assassination.", "*Jean Hill:  The Lady in Red by Prof. John McAdams", "*The JFK 100: One Hundred Errors of Fact and Judgment in Oliver Stone's JFK: Eyewitness Jean Hill by David Reitzes", "*Jean Hill \u2014 The Lady in Red by Peter R.
