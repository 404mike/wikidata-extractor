He played a key role in the Battle of Lincoln Fair in 1217. He attempted to rival Hubert de Burgh, and as a result fell from power in 1224. His \"heraldic device\" is now popularly said to have been a griffin, although his coat of arms as depicted by Matthew Paris (died 1259) in his Chronica Majora (folio 64/68 verso) was Gules, a cinquefoil argent.When he married the widow Margaret de Redvers, she was an heiress and the last of her father's Baldwin de Redvers line, and the Earl of Devon's line became extinct.  The title was inherited by Isabella de Fortibus, owner of the Isle of Wight, whose extensive fortune became the property of Hugh de Courtenay, the next Earl of Devon and Baron of Okehampton.  Fawkes' new wife's home in London was then called \"Fawkes Hall\" (Falkes' Hall), which over the years changed into \"Foxhall\" and finally into \"Vauxhall\". The Vauxhall car company derived its name from that part of London and still uses de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9's griffin as its badge. The house stood on approximately 31 acres in the royal manor of Kennington; it was the centre of tension between the Archbishop at Lambeth Palace and the monks of Canterbury, who tried to influence the election of English bishops.", "link_mentions": []}}
