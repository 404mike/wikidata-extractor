This is due to his \"great pace and being an effective striker.\" After joining Crawley Town, he continued his success by helping the club get promoted to League Two in the 2010\u201311 season. However, after leaving Crawley Town, The False Nine website mentioned about his career decline despite being the League Two's top scorer in the 2014\u201315 season while playing for AFC Wimbledon and Portsmouth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Verwood", "response": ["*Matt Tubbs \u2013 footballer"]}, {"page": "Crawley Town F.C.", "response": ["In 2010, Bruce Winfield announced that he and Susan Carter had become majority shareholders and had attracted new investment for the club, some of which came from overseas. The investment allowed manager Steve Evans to start rebuilding the squad, which saw 23 players signed over a six-month period including Matt Tubbs, for \u00a370,000, Sergio Torres for a record \u00a3100,000, and Richard Brodie for an undisclosed fee, which was estimated to be a new Conference record of \u00a3275,000.", "Crawley finished 2011 at the top of League Two; a positive start to their first campaign in league football. However, despite continued success in the FA Cup, form slipped. Between 17 December 2011, and 13 March 2012, Crawley won just two league games out of a possible 14. Many argued the sales of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett for \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31,100,000 respectively, as well as failing to reach a deal over Andy Drury contributed to their dip in form. Three Crawley players were involved in a post-match brawl against Bradford City, including former club captain Pablo Mills (suspended for six matches) and fellow defender Claude Davis (suspended for four matches). Five players from both clubs were suspended in total equalling the record for the most dismissals in an English game. Consequently, Crawley were fined \u00a318,000. Following an FA inquiry into the events that took place, Kyle McFadzean was handed a four-game suspension after being found guilty of violent conduct. All three players have since released apology statements, and were all fined two weeks' wages. Despite apologising, Mills was stripped of his captaincy for behaviour not befitting the role of a club captain. He was released by the club at the conclusion of the 2011/12 season.", "On 9 April, it was announced that Steve Evans had parted company with Crawley to take up a post at Rotherham United. Evans revealed \"In my opinion, how far can I take Crawley Town? League One certainly, but beyond that I was not so sure\". Evans had previously admitted frustration over the departures of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett. Assistant manager Paul Raynor also left the club with immediate effect, with coach Craig Brewster taking over as manager for the remainder of the season.

Long-serving Nick Holmes followed him out the door, which left Darrell Clarke and Mikey Harris in temporary charge of a depleted squad in the lead up to the season.

He needed to secure an immediate promotion in order to maintain the funding to keep the club a full-time professional organization and so recruited young players freshly released from Football League clubs. However he lost top-scorer Matt Tubbs, who was sold for a club record \u00a355,000 to Crawley Town.
