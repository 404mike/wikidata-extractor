It elects one Member of Parliament by the first-past-the-post system of election, and was created for the 1983 general election. It has been a safe Conservative Party seat at recent elections. It is currently represented by Robert Courts of the Conservative Party.\nIt was represented from 2001 to 2016 by David Cameron, Leader of the Conservative Party (2005-2016) and UK Prime Minister (2010-2016). On 12 September 2016, Cameron resigned from serving as an MP triggering the 2016 Witney by-election, at which Robert Courts of the Conservatives retained the seat; albeit with a reduced majority. His vote share subsequently rose to 55% at the 2017 and 2019 general elections.\nIt is coterminous with the district of West Oxfordshire, and includes the towns of Carterton, Chipping Norton and Woodstock.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derek Enright", "response": ["He married Jane Simmons in 1963, and they had two sons and two daughters.
