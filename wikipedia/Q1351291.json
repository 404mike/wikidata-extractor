Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a longtime collaborator, said, \"His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique.\" Many of Grant's films of the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, he was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously. These performances were sometimes deemed excessive, in the words of The Washington Posts Rita Kempley, due to Grant's \"comic overreactions\u2014the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids\". She added: \"He's got more tics than Benny Hill.\" His penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, Grant must get \"his jiving and shucking under control\". Film historian David Thomson opined in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that the actor equated merely \"itchy mannerisms\" with screen acting.David Thomson A New Biographical Dictionary of Film, London: Little"]}, {"page": "Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama", "response": ["|Frost/Nixon  || Ron Howard || Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard", "|align=\"left\" | Rush || Ron Howard || Andrew Eaton, Eric Fellner, Brian Oliver, Peter Morgan, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard", "|align=\"left\" | The Theory of Everything  || James Marsh || Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Lisa Bruce, Anthony McCarten"]}, {"page": "Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|O Brother, Where Art Thou? || Joel Coen || Tim Bevan, Ethan Coen, & Eric Fellner", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Bridget Jones's Diary || Sharon Maguire || Tim Bevan, Jonathan Cavendish, & Eric Fellner", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|About a Boy || Chris Weitz & Paul Weitz || Tim Bevan, Robert De Niro, Brad Epstein, Eric Fellner, & Jane Rosenthal", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Love Actually || Richard Curtis || Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, & Duncan Kenworthy", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Pride & Prejudice || Joe Wright || Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, & ", "| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2012 || style=\"background:#b0c4de; text-align:left;\"| Les Mis\u00e9rables  || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"| Tom Hooper || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"| Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Debra Hayward, and Cameron Mackintosh", "|Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Guy Heeley"]}, {"page": "Ali G Indahouse", "response": ["Category:Films produced by Eric Fellner"]}, {"page": "The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)", "response": ["The Coen brothers began writing the script in the mid-1990s, taking a break in between to film The Big Lebowski.
