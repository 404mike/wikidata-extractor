He got Randall a trial at Rovers and after impressing in the trial match he was invited back to play in the youth team and 'A'-team matches but after a year he was released. After leaving school he went to work with his dad as a groundsman at Millfield and was still playing for Glastonbury Town now under the management of former Cardiff City player Peter Thomas. Randall scored 24 goals in his first season under Thomas and he soon got him a trial with Cardiff City.
