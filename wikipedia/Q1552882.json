Although the Oxford school was frequently associated with pluralism,  during the 1970s Fox adopted an overtly radical position. In \"Industrial relations: a social critique of pluralist ideology\" (1973) and Beyond Contract (1974), he suggested that unitarism and pluralism, in practice, were often combined and/or difficult to distinguish."]}, {"page": "Mary Saran", "response": ["In Britain she worked with in the Socialist Vanguard Group (SVG), which was effectively the British branch of the ISK.   In 1941 she became editor of the group's monthly publication, retaining the editorship (latterly jointly with Rita Hinden) until 1955.  During the 1930s she had obtained British citizenship, in 1935/36 briefly marrying a fellow socialist, Allan Flanders, in support of her citizenship application.   War ended in defeat for the Nazi r\u00e9gime in May 1945.   Many of the socialist refugees from Nazism, who had lived in England since the 1930s now returned to Germany, including Minna Specht with whom Saran had at times worked closely in London.  Mary Saran stayed on in England, working as a freelance journalist, contributing particularly (but not exclusively) to socialist and women's publications.  Till 1947 she was the editor for \"Europe speaks\" in succession to Willi Eichler who had also returned to Germany.   She also worked with the UNESCO, focusing on women's issues.   She continued to play an active part in British Labour Party politics and in adult education.   From 1974 she taught in a London school.   Her memoir appeared in 1976 under the title \"Never give up\".   1976 was also the year in which she died.   Her English language memoir was translated by her friend, the historian Susanne Miller, and published privately in Germany under the title \"Gib niemals auf. Erinnerungen\" in 1979."]}, {"page": "Socialist Vanguard Group", "response": ["Gerhard Kumleben of the ISK travelled to England in 1928, seeking support for the group's ideas.
