Caldwell began his career with Rangers and made one league appearance before his release in 1995. Following his release from Ibrox, Caldwell moved to Dundee United, where he featured in the first four appearances of the season, scoring in the Scottish Challenge Cup match against Cowdenbeath. The goal proved to be Caldwell's only in senior football as, appearing in one further match, his last matchday appearance was as an unused substitute in September 1995.\nAfter leaving United, Caldwell moved to junior side Petershill but left Petershill Park after one season, moving to Rutherglen Glencairn afterwards before retiring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1995\u201396 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["Manager Billy Kirkwood continued to rebuild the team over the close season, bringing in Motherwell defender Rab Shannon, Rangers keeper Ally Maxwell and Neil Caldwell, also from Ibrox. Another two ex-Rangers players arrived before the start of the season, with Steven Pressley and Sandy Robertson both arriving from Coventry City. The Rangers connection continued when the Ibrox club made a bid of \u00a31.5 million for Gordan Petric, which United accepted and this money helped to re-shape the team well into the new season.
