He originally asked Sergei Rachmaninoff to be the Philharmonic's first music director; however, Rachmaninoff had only recently moved to New York, and he did not wish to move again. Clark then selected Walter Henry Rothwell, former assistant to Gustav Mahler, as music director, and hired away several principal musicians from East Coast orchestras and others from the competing and soon-to-be defunct Los Angeles Symphony. The orchestra played its first concert in the Trinity Auditorium in the same year, eleven days after its first rehearsal.

According to Edwin Franko Goldman, big-band summer concert series of this type were still relatively new, and Volpe's was one of the first of its kind after Goldman's own. Rather than playing the type of stirring patriotic and popular music common to outdoor concerts, Volpe's idea was to present a more challenging programme of Classical and Operatic works to a broad audience. Although critics expected it to fail, it was very successful and attracted large audiences of thousands. After Volpe conducted it for its first two summer seasons, in 1920 Walter Henry Rothwell took it over, followed by Victor Herbert and Henry Hadley in 1922."]}, {"page": "Walter H.
