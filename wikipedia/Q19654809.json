It is gratifying, too, to discover that the actress has taken the pains to overcome mannerisms which in previous performances have marred her work. She no longer bites her lips, at every opportunity to express complexity of thought. And though she rustles overmuch in places, she has gained largely in repose. In fact, she is, on the whole, a young actress of fine gifts and beautiful power.\"New York Times October 26, 1912  At the end of 1912, Stevens appeared in Tornadot, by German playwright Karl Volmoeller (English version by Jethor Bethell.)New York Times \"Many New Plays\"December 29, 1912  Stevens depicted the character of Mary Turner in Within The Law in  Chicago, Illinois, also in 1912.
