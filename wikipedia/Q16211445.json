Due to being the only judge to remain for the whole ten years, he was awarded by being assigned the Boys category, instead of the Overs and Groups he was assigned to every year, since mentoring Shayne Ward in 2005. His category consisted of Nicholas McDonald, Luke Friend, and Sam Callahan. McDonald finished in second place to Sam Bailey, mentored by Osbourne. Despite not winning, this was still by far Walsh's most successful year as a judge on the show due to going 5 weeks (breaking a record) without having any of his acts in the bottom two and had two of them (Friend and McDonald) in the final."]}, {"page": "Sinitta", "response": ["In 2013, Sinitta helped Walsh to select Nicholas McDonald, who eventually finished second, and the same year she performed a cover of the 1980s hit \"Take On Me\" on Children in Need.
