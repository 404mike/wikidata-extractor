Rommel's successes in World War I were based on surprise and manoeuvre, two elements for which the new panzer units were ideally suited. Rommel received a promotion to a general's rank from Hitler ahead of more senior officers. Rommel obtained the command he aspired to, despite having been earlier turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division instead. According to Peter Caddick-Adams, he was backed by Hitler, the influential Fourteenth Army commander Wilhelm List (a fellow W\u00fcrttemberger middle-class \"military outsider\") and likely Guderian as well."]}, {"page": "Miles Dempsey", "response": ["During a visit to his nephew Michael in Kenya, Dempsey felt a pain in his back.

The historian Peter Caddick-Adams suggests that, following his forced suicide, Rommel emerged as the \"acceptable face of German militarism, the 'good' German who stood apart from the Nazi regime.\" The ground was thus fertile for the myth to be reborn after the war, in the interest of the program of the German rearmament and the Allied\u2013West German reconciliation.", "The historians Ralf Georg Reuth, David T. Zabecki, Bruce Allen Watson and Peter Caddick-Adams, state that Rommel was one of Hitler's favorite generals and that his close relationship with the dictator benefited both his inter-war and war-time career. Robert Citino describes Rommel as \"not apolitical\" and writes that he owed his career to Hitler, to whom his attitude was \"worshipful\", while the historian Charles Messenger describes Rommel's \"growing admiration\" towards Hitler following the invasion of Poland. Speaking at The National WWII Museum's 2012 International Conference on World War II, the author Nigel Hamilton referred to Rommel as \"quite a Nazi\". This sympathy did not extend to the Party though. In this regard, he was similar to many other Wehrmacht soldiers, who, with encouragement from Hitler, erroneously believed the army to be the most important element of the regime. Rommel showed particular resentment towards the SA and later, the SS, for their brutality and absorption of resources and personnel."]}, {"page": "Caddick-Adams, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Caddick-Adams"]}]}}
