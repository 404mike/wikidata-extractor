He was President of the Royal Irish Academy (1822\u201335), President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1831\u201333). He was awarded the Cunningham Medal in 1818, and the Copley Medal in 1824.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Paley", "response": ["Paley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. \"For my part\", he says, \"I take my stand in human anatomy\"; elsewhere he insists upon \"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear\". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies. Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the Watchmaker analogy.  Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock.  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend John Law and the Dublin Astronomer Royal John Brinkley."]}, {"page": "William Rowan Hamilton", "response": ["Hamilton is said to have shown immense talent at a very early age. Hamilton's predecessor as Royal Astronomer of Ireland and later Bishop of Cloyne Dr. John Brinkley remarked of the 18-year-old Hamilton, 'This young man, I do not say will be, but is, the first mathematician of his age.'Sir W. R. Hamilton  The Gentleman's magazine. vol 220, 1866 Jan-Jun, p. 129", "From that time Hamilton appears to have devoted himself almost wholly to mathematics, though he always kept himself well acquainted with the progress of science both in Britain and abroad. Hamilton found an important defect in one of Laplace's demonstrations, and he was induced by a friend to write out his remarks, so that they could be shown to Dr. John Brinkley, then the first Royal Astronomer of Ireland, and an accomplished mathematician. Brinkley seems to have immediately perceived Hamilton's talents, and to have encouraged him in the kindest way."]}, {"page": "1824 in science", "response": ["* Copley Medal: John Brinkley"]}, {"page": "John Pond", "response": ["In 1811 Pond succeeded Nevil Maskelyne as Astronomer Royal. During an administration of nearly twenty-five years, he effected a reform of practical astronomy in England comparable to that brought about by Friedrich Bessel in Germany. In 1821 he began to employ the method of observation by reflection and in 1825 devised means of combining two mural circles in the determination of the place of a single object, the one serving for direct and the other for reflected vision. Under his auspices the instrumental equipment at Greenwich was completely changed and the number of assistants increased from one to six. The superior accuracy of his determinations was attested by Seth Carlo Chandler's 1894 discussion of them in the course of his researches into the variation of latitude. Between 1810 and 1824 he persistently controverted the reality of Ireland's Astronomer Royal John Brinkley's imaginary star-parallaxes. During the 1829-31 period, he briefly served as Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac. Delicacy of health obliged his retirement in the autumn of 1835."]}, {"page": "1835 in science", "response": ["* September 14 \u2013 John Brinkley (born 1763), British astronomer."]}, {"page": "1763 in science", "response": ["* January 31 (bapt.) \u2013 John Brinkley, English astronomer (died 1835)"]}]}}
