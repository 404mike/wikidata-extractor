In 1960 he took 97 wickets at 19.83, including 7 for 47 and 4 for 32 against Middlesex at Lord's. Also a useful batsman in the lower order, Slade appeared to have a chance of a significant career. However, the arrival of another left-arm spinner, Norman Gifford, in the Worcestershire team in 1960 began to restrict Slade's opportunities. He played only twice in 1961 and when he did make the First Eleven, he found himself frequently used as the sixth bowler. The registration of Basil D'Oliveira in 1964 further restricted Slade's prospects. \nAfter taking 71 wickets in 1963, he became a bit player in the county team. However, he toured Pakistan with the Commonwealth XI in 1963-64, playing in all three matches against Pakistan and taking more wickets than any other Commonwealth XI bowler. He was an important member of Worcestershire's Championship-winning sides of 1964 and 1965, though in each season he played only a handful of games. He made 634 runs in 1969, scoring 125 against Leicestershire at Grace Road after going in at number three as nightwatchman.Slade left New Road after the 1971 season and played with considerable success for Shropshire between 1973 and 1978 and in the Birmingham League. He appeared in Shropshire's first (and of 2020 only) Minor Counties Championship win, against Staffordshire at London Road, Shrewsbury in August of 1973 when he sustained a broken thumb on his bowling hand during first innings but returned to bat in the second when he was bowled out for two; however he ended play having achieved 16 overs (including 15 maidens) and taken four wickets for one run. He went on to captain Shropshire in 1977-78, and in the same period played at club level for West Bromwich Dartmouth.He later served on the Worcestershire committee. He worked as a salesman selling central reservation barriers for motorways, and also helped to run the family farm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": [":1960: Doug Slade"]}, {"page": "Birmingham and District Premier League", "response": ["| Doug Slade"]}, {"page": "Shropshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Doug Slade (former Worcestershire slow left-arm bowler)"]}, {"page": "Slade (surname)", "response": ["* Doug Slade (born 1940), former English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Roy Booth", "response": ["Booth's contribution to the success was substantial. Taller than many wicket-keepers of the period, he seemed well-equipped to handle Worcestershire's battery of fast-medium bowlers in the late 1950s, led by Jack Flavell and Len Coldwell. But the emergence from 1960 of a more balanced bowling attack, with the arrival of first Doug Slade and then Norman Gifford, both slow left-arm, not only gave Worcestershire a Championship-winning edge but also showed Booth to be among the best all-round wicket-keepers in the country at the time. Despite his record, he appears never to have been close to Test selection, as the long-standing Godfrey Evans was succeeded as England wicketkeeper by a series of players (Roy Swetman, John Murray, Geoff Millman, Jim Parks) a few years younger than Booth."]}, {"page": "Douglas Slade", "response": ["#REDIRECT Doug Slade"]}, {"page": "John Aldridge (cricketer)", "response": ["At the start of the following season, 1960, Aldridge was again no-balled for throwing by umpire Jack Crapp in a game against Glamorgan at Pontypridd. Contemporary opinion appears to have been divided about the legality of Aldridge's bowling action: where other bowlers such as Tony Lock, Harold Rhodes, Pearson and the South African Geoff Griffin were suspect through physique or technique, Aldridge was a borderline offender. \"There is no true identity of opinion,\" said an article by the cricket correspondent of The Times early in the 1960 season before the issue came to a head with the no-balling of Griffin in the Lord's Test. \"Some, for instance, say that Aldridge, of Worcestershire, throws, others that he does not.\" In any case, as a bowler, Aldridge was much less effective in 1960 than he had been previously, his 40 wickets costing almost 30 runs apiece. Also, the emergence of left-arm orthodox spinners Doug Slade and Norman Gifford changed the balance of the Worcestershire bowling attack away from its dependence on seam bowling. Aldridge left the Worcestershire staff at the end of the 1960 season."]}, {"page": "Gideon Hudson", "response": ["In 1964, Hudson made his only first-class appearance for Oxford University against Worcestershire.
