During this time, work in the EGI expanded from the field of population biology to encompass the new field of behavioural ecology, with John Krebs and Nick Davies (then at Oxford, later Professor of Behavioural Ecology at Cambridge) co-authoring the textbooks that defined the field. The EGI was also the centre for work on The Birds of the Western Palearctic, up to its completion in 1990s, and became increasingly important as a training centre for ornithologists who went on to play important roles in conservation."]}, {"page": "New Naturalist", "response": ["|Chris Perrins"]}, {"page": "C.M.
