He was a key part of the Somerset team that won the 'Second-class County Championship' in 1890 by winning twelve of their thirteen matches, tying the other with Middlesex. A right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler, he was known for being able to bowl long, accurate spells.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "E. W. Bastard", "response": ["His first-class career was confined to his university years, when he appeared for both Oxford and Somerset. Close to the top of the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 first-class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of first-class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's first-class career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed first-class cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols. He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton.", "Bastard graduated from Oxford in 1885, gaining his B.A. that year, and collecting his M.A. three years later. He continued to play cricket for Somerset, who had by this stage been stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.Foot (1986), pp. 23\u201328. He picked up plenty of wickets, particularly in 1886 and 1887; eleven in a match against Hampshire, with eight in the first innings, fifteen against Devon, and another eight in the first innings against Warwickshire being the highlights. However, the additions of Sammy Woods, Ted Tyler and George Nichols resulted in Bastard bowling less frequently, and he made his final appearance for the county in August 1889 against the MCC. He was not required to bowl in the match, which Somerset won by 9 wickets, thanks to Tyler and Woods. He was described by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as \"the chief bowler in the Somersetshire eleven before the County became first-class.\""]}, {"page": "Herbie Hewett", "response": ["Hewett led his side in their first County Championship match starting on 18 May 1891. Although the club had played first-class cricket a few years earlier, the championship had only been formed the previous season. Their debut in the competition was interrupted by rain and finished a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's only innings with 31. Somerset's next match was against reigning county champions Surrey. Lionel Palairet, Bill Roe and Sammy Woods were all missing for various reasons, leaving Hewett with a depleted side and only two real bowlers; Ted Tyler and George Nichols. Surrey reached 449, and then bowled Somerset out twice, for 37 in each innings.Foot (1986), pp. 28\u201329. When Surrey travelled to Taunton later that season, most likely expecting an easy win to secure a second consecutive championship, Hewett top-scored for his team with 55 in the first-innings as Somerset reached 194. Woods, Nichols and Tyler then secured a 40 run first-innings lead for the home side who added another 331 runs in their second-innings, Hewett contributing 42. The same trio of Somerset bowlers proceeded to bowl the champions out for a second time, the final wicket falling two minutes from the close of play, and their team recorded a 130-run victory.Foot (1986), pp. 29\u201332. Hewett had a quiet season with the bat, in addition to his 55 against Surrey he passed 50 on only one other occasion; against Middlesex two weeks later. He totalled 514 runs during the season at an average of 19.76; his lowest average when playing eight or more innings in a season."]}, {"page": "William Brain", "response": ["Born in Clifton, Bristol, Brain was a member of the Clifton College\"Clifton College Register\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p98: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 XI, captaining it in 1889. He went up to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1889 and made his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1891 against Lancashire, in the same year hitting his only half-century by making 65 not out (with no teammate scoring more than 13) in his only appearance for MCC, against Somerset. Playing for Gloucestershire in 1893, Brain made three stumpings from successive balls bowled by Charlie Townsend, removing Arthur Newton, George Nichols and Ted Tyler to finish off the Somerset second innings."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* George Nichols (1891\u20131899) 134 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.Foot (1986), pp. 23\u201328. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton, during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy.Roebuck (1991), pp. 30\u201332. In Somerset's first match of 1886, Sainsbury hit his highest score for the county in almost three years, scoring 90 out of a Somerset total of 241. The bowling of Arnold Fothergill helped to restrict their opponents, Warwickshire, in the second innings; but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory, Somerset were bowled out for 58. Throughout 1886, Sainsbury's batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in the previous two years of first-class cricket, and he regularly made scores in the twenties and thirties. He hit 94 from the middle order against the MCC in mid-August, his highest score of the season. Toward the end of the 1886 season the arrival of Sammy Woods and George Nichols vastly improved the quality of the bowling for the county, but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start.Roebuck (1991), pp. 36\u201343. A victory over Essex, in which Sainsbury scored 71, was bracketed by heavy losses to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire. Against Hampshire, Sainsbury reached his highest total for Somerset, scoring 164 out of a total of 315, to help his side on their way to a six-wicket victory. A big win over Warwickshire followed, and the county was said to be \"a ship heading out for an ocean of prosperity\".Roebuck (1991), p. 43."]}, {"page": "George Nichols", "response": ["George Nichols or Nicholls may refer to:", "*George Nichols (actor and director) (1864\u20131927), American actor and director", "*George Nichols (Australian politician) (1809\u20131857), New South Wales politician", "*George Nichols (American politician) (1827\u20131907), Vermont physician, politician, and educator", "*George Nichols (cricketer) (1862\u20131911), Gloucestershire and Somerset first-class cricketer", "*George Nichols (boxer) (1907\u20131986), light heavyweight boxer", "*George Nichols (martyr) (c. 1550\u20131589), English Catholic martyr"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1890", "response": ["| George Nichols || style=\"text-align:center\"| ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast-medium ||"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1891", "response": ["Having played what is generally considered their debut first-class match against Lancashire in 1882, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status following the 1885 season, after a string of heavy losses and matches in which they could not field eleven men.Foot (1986), p23.Roebuck (1991), pp29\u201332.
