During Lloyd George's first year as prime minister, in summer 1917, Riddell assessed his personality:His energy, capacity for work, and power of recuperation are remarkable. He has an extraordinary memory, imagination, and the art of getting at the root of a matter.\u00a0... He is not afraid of responsibility, and has no respect for tradition or convention. He is always ready to examine, scrap or revise established theories and practices. These qualities give him unlimited confidence in himself.\u00a0... He is one of the craftiest of men, and his extraordinary charm of manner not only wins him friends, but does much to soften the asperities of his opponents and enemies. He is full of humour and a born actor.\u00a0... He has an instinctive power of divining the thoughts and intentions of people with whom he is conversing\u00a0... His chief defects are: (1) Lack of appreciation of existing institutions, organisations, and stolid, dull people\u00a0... their ways are not his ways and their methods are not his methods. (2) Fondness for a grandiose scheme in preference to an attempt to improve existing machinery. (3) Disregard of difficulties in carrying out big projects\u00a0... he is not a man of detail."]}, {"page": "George Eastman", "response": ["Eastman donated \u00a3200,000 in 1926 to fund a dental clinic in London, UK after being approached by the Chairman of the Royal Free Hospital, George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell.
