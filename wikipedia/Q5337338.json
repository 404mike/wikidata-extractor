To escape the Blitz, in 1940 she moved to the United States, there studying acting in New York City. Proceeding to Hollywood in 1942, she signed to MGM and obtained her first film roles, in Gaslight (1944) and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), earning her two Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe Award. She appeared in 11 further MGM films, mostly in minor roles, and after her contract ended in 1952 she began supplementing her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Although largely seen as a B-list star during this period, her appearance in the film The Manchurian Candidate (1962) received widespread acclaim and is cited as being one of her finer performances. Moving into musical theatre, Lansbury first worked with Stephen Sondheim in Anyone Can Whistle (1964), before Lansbury finally gained stardom for playing the leading role in Jerry Herman's Broadway musical Mame (1966), which earned her her first Tony Award and established her as a gay icon.", " Her birthplace is sometimes given, wrongly, as Poplar, East London. Lansbury says she has ancestral connections to Poplar but she was born in Regent's Park, Central London. \"I want to make one thing clear: I was not born in Poplar, that's not true, I was born in Regent's Park, so I wasn't born in the East End, I wish I could say I had been. Certainly my antecedents were: my grandfather, my father.\" (mins 3\u20134) Her mother was Belfast-born actress Moyna Macgill (born Charlotte Lillian McIldowie), who regularly appeared on stage in the West End and who had also starred in several films. Her father was the wealthy English timber merchant and politician Edgar Lansbury, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and former mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Her paternal grandfather was the Labour Party leader and anti-war activist George Lansbury, a man whom she felt \"awed\" by and considered \"a giant in my youth\". Angela had an older half sister, Isolde, who was the daughter of Moyna's previous marriage to writer and director Reginald Denham. In January 1930, when Angela was four, her mother gave birth to twin boys, Bruce and Edgar, leading the Lansburys to move from their Poplar flat to a house in Mill Hill, North London; on weekends they would vacate to a rural farm in Berrick Salome, near Wallingford, Oxfordshire."]}, {"page": "The Subject Was Roses", "response": ["* 1965 Tony Award for Best Play - Frank D.

When Mastroianni realized that Lansbury had little interest in the project during the middle of the pitch, he spontaneously suggested that the aforementioned plot be a self-referential film-within-a-film. This idea piqued Lansbury's interest, after which Mastroianni commissioned Scott Parker to write a screenplay for a slasher film that began with an opening sequence in which two characters watch a horror film in a movie theater, during which one of them is murdered by a serial killer.
