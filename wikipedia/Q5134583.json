Soon after, Mel Harley (drums) and Phil Barnes (bass) completed the line up.", "Initially Any Trouble were a covers band, playing anything they liked, including songs by Bob Dylan, The Band and a selection of American rock and roll numbers. With the advent of punk rock and then new wave, Clive Gregson realised they needed a change of material and started taking songwriting seriously. He explained in a 1999 interview, \"We were like a human jukebox and it was obvious to me then if we wanted to get anywhere we needed original songs. I started to take it a bit more seriously then\".", "After vocalist Tom Jackson left, the band was fronted by rhythm guitarist and songwriter Clive Gregson. The remaining four were the first Any Trouble line-up to record, initially releasing the Gregson composition \"Yesterday's Love\" as an indie single in 1979. This was picked up by some radio stations and was played by BBC Radio 1 DJs John Peel, Andy Peebles and others in the UK.", "Despite frequent touring and the release of Wheels in Motion, Any Trouble's record sales failed to grow. The band were dropped by Stiff during a 1983 US tour supporting Ian Hunter, with their manager arranging for them to open for Molly Hatchet to help keep them afloat. At that point Clive Gregson \"pulled my plug... threw in the towel... we straggled back to NYC, where our van was robbed whilst we were in the Stiff offices trying to wrestle return tickets to the UK out of the office manager\". The band flew back to the UK on standby tickets.Interview with Clive Gregson from Any Trouble: The Complete Stiff Recordings 1980-1981 booklet", "After returning from their US tour without a recording contract Any Trouble took a long break, after which Clive Gregson returned to making demos. He had a meeting with subsequent manager Ray Williams who persuaded him Any Trouble had a sufficient following to justify its revival. Gregson re-formed the band and, on the strength of the demos, Williams secured a contract with Gery Gersh at EMI America.", "Any Trouble's new line-up included Andy Ebsworth on drums and Steve Gurl on keyboards, with original members Clive Gregson and Phil Barnes. The sessions started promisingly enough with Val Garay (The Motels) as producer but Garay left after contract negotiations broke down. David Kershenbaum (best known for producing Joe Jackson and, later, Tracy Chapman) was brought on board to produce the band's eponymous third album Any Trouble but they were unhappy with the synthesizer-heavy sound of the final mix. While they toured the UK to support the album there were no funds available from the record company for a US tour; the album failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic.", "Gregson decided to throw everything into Any Trouble's second effort for EMI America, producing an ambitious double album (an 11-track single LP in the US) that featured a mixture of new and previously recorded material to highlight the band's diverse range of material. The new release, titled Wrong End of the Race, also failed to chart despite support from the record company. After the failure of their second EMI album, Clive Gregson broke the band up again. He recorded a solo album and joined Richard Thompson's band for a time before starting a successful folk-rock duo with Christine Collister in the mid-1980s, on the dissolution of which he resumed his solo career from 1992 to the present. Gregson has also toured and recorded in various combinations of musicians, including Boo Hewerdine, Eddi Reader, Nanci Griffith, Andy Roberts, Ian Matthews and Dennis Locorriere.
