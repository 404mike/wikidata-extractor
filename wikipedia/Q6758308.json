Tomlinson praised his defence for his solid start to the season. With five clean sheets in his first ten games, Tomlinson was offered a one-year contract extension in September 2010. Two months later he was reported in the Daily Star and the Daily Mirror to be a \u00a3250,000 transfer target for Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers. Adams dismissed such speculation with the comment \"that amount of money wouldn't buy Stuart's left hand\". Sent off on New Year's Day after a collision with Rotherham United's Marcus Marshall, Tomlinson lost his place in the first eleven due to injury and suspension, but then won back his place after Martin conceded a comical own goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Stevenage on 22 February. It was an eventful return for Tomlinson, who broke the story of Jim Gannon and Geoff Horsfield's bust-up on the pre-match coach trip to Aldershot via Twitter. The game itself was also eventful, as Tomlinson gave away a penalty, which he then saved, only to leave the pitch due to a hip injury. Martin regained his first team place after the game, only to be replaced by Tomlinson at half-time during a 2\u20131 loss at home to Oxford United on 12 March, after Martin committed another blunder."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=center|Marcus Marshall", "|align=center|Marcus Marshall"]}, {"page": "Greg Pearson", "response": ["Pearson scored his first two goals for Grimsby on 27 August 2012 against Mansfield Town, scoring the second goal of the game after great work by Aswad Thomas to beat his marker for pace, but was brought down in the box, up came Pearson to confidently score the penalty kick on 45 minutes, he scored the fourth goal of the game on 76 minutes with a superb flick on at the front post that looped over the head of the head of the helpless Alan Marriott into the net, the game finishing a 4\u20131 to Grimsby.
