They were led by Hubertus Johannes van Mook, a colonial administrator who had evacuated to Brisbane, Australia. Dutch soldiers who had been POWs under the Japanese were released and rearmed. Shooting between these Dutch soldiers and police supporting the new Republican government Indonesian and civilians soon developed. This soon escalated to armed conflict between the newly constituted Republican forces aided by a myriad of pro-independence mobs and the Dutch and British forces. On 10 November, a full-scale battle broke out in Surabaya between the 49th Infantry Brigade of the British Indian Army and Indonesian nationalist militias. The British-Indian force were supported by air and naval forces. Some 300 Indian soldiers were killed (including their commander Brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby), as were thousands of nationalist militiamen and other Indonesians. Shootouts broke out with alarming regularity in Jakarta, including an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Sjahrir by Dutch gunmen. To avoid this menace, Sukarno and majority of his government left for the safety of Yogyakarta on 4 January 1946. There, the Republican government received protection and full support from Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Yogyakarta would remain as the Republic's capital until the end of the war in 1949. Sjahrir remained in Jakarta to conduct negotiations with the British."]}, {"page": "Idrus", "response": ["At the beginning of the Indonesian National Revolution, where Indonesian revolutionaries asserted independence between the Japanese surrender and Dutch return, Idrus was in Surabaya, East Java; while there, he witnessed the Battle of Surabaya, in which British forces under the command of Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby and revolutionary forces under the command of Moestopo began fighting after a miscommunication.

On 26 October, British soldiers and men from the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration landed in Surabaya to occupy the city, which had recently been evacuated by the Japanese garrison. This act caused tensions to flair between the British and the local Indonesians, many of whom now considered themselves to be citizens of an independent Indonesia. Violence soon began, and soon former members of PETA, including Mangundiprojo, formed units to fight against the British forces. A ceasefire was called on 29 October, and local resistance leader Oerip Soemohardjo selected Mangundiprojo to work with the British to ensure the ceasefire was maintained. While touring the city with British brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby, the British officer attempted to secure the safe return of a group of Indian soldiers whom had been surrounded by a crowd of independence supporters. The situation escalated when Mangundiprojo was briefly captured by the Indian soldiers, and in the confusion Mallaby was killed by a member of the crowd while the brigadier sheltered in his car. His death provoked a reprisal by the British, starting the battle of Battle of Surabaya. Mangundiprojo fought during the battle against the British. During the later Indonesian war of Independence, Mangundiprojo played a role in seizing a large sum of money that the Dutch colonial authorities were keeping in a bank."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Surabaya", "response": ["** 30 October \u2013 British Indian Army officer Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby was killed in his car."]}]}}
