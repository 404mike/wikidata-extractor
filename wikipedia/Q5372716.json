She began her opera career in Italy, France and Spain, making her British debut in 1837. Critics praised the beauty of her voice but found her acting too \"ladylike\" and lacking energy. She also sang prolifically on the concert stage. After giving birth to her fifth child, she returned briefly to singing, but died only months later at the age of 32.", "link_mentions": {}}}
