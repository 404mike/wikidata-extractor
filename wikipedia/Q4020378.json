In 666, he was translated from Dorchester to London.Bede tells us that Wine was ordained bishop in the Frankish kingdom and that King Cenwalh of Wessex installed him after disagreements with the previous Frankish bishop, Agilbert. Wine too was forced to leave after a few years and took refuge with Wulfhere, king of Mercia, who installed him in London, after a payment to Wulfhere.In 665, while in Wessex, Wine took part with two Welsh or British bishops in the ordination of Chad as bishop of the Northumbrians, an act that was uncanonical because the other two bishops' ordination was not recognised by Rome. This would have resulted in his being disciplined, along with Chad, by Theodore of Tarsus, the new archbishop of Canterbury, who arrived in 669. Since Bede does not list him among the miscreants at this point, it is possible he had died by this date.\nWine died sometime before 672.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kingdom of Essex", "response": ["Wine (in 666)Fryde, et al.

This building, known as the Old Minster, became the cathedral for the new Diocese of Winchester in 662, a vast area stretching from the English Channel to the River Thames, the bishopric having been transferred from Dorchester on Thames, Oxfordshire by Bishop Wine. The design of this early church cannot be confirmed, for no trace other than ground plan exists today, but Wolstan mentions a gateway tower situated some distance from the west end. Wine died in c. 672, but one of his later successors, Swithun, would become one of the most famous Bishops of Winchester. "]}, {"page": "Wulfhere of Mercia", "response": ["It is apparent from these events that Oswiu's influence in the south had waned by this time, if not before, and that Wulfhere now dominated the area. This becomes even clearer in the next few years, as some time between 665 and 668 Wulfhere sold the see of London to Wine, who had been expelled from his West Saxon bishopric by Cenwealh. London fell within the East Saxons' territory in that period.  From the archaeological evidence, it appears to be about this time that the Middle Saxon settlement in London began to expand significantly; the centre of Anglo-Saxon London was not at the old Roman centre, but about a mile west of that, near what is now the location of the Strand. Wulfhere may have been in control of the city when this expansion began.Robert Cowie, \"Mercian London\" in Brown and Farr, Mercia, pp. 198\u20139"]}]}}
