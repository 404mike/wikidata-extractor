Specifically, Jennifer Hornsby and John McDowell argue against any ontological gap between what we think is true and what is actually true.  Quietists about truth resist the distinction between truth bearers and truthmakers as leading to a correspondence theory of truth.  Rather they claim that such a distinction should be eliminated, true statements are simply one thinking truly about the world.  The target of these thoughts is not a truthbearer, but rather the facts of the world themselves."]}, {"page": "Miranda Fricker", "response": ["* The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy, co-edited with Jennifer Hornsby (Cambridge University Press, 2000)"]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Jennifer Hornsby"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers of language", "response": ["* Jennifer Hornsby"]}]}}
