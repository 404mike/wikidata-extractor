Only the \"highest and purest blood of the race\" and the most renowned heroes, were selected to guard the flag when it was displayed. These twelve men, with a sword in hand, would stand just behind the chief who was always put in front. One family produced the hereditary keepers of the flag; and of this family, only the eldest living male could unfurl the flag. This family was called \"Clan Tormad Vic Vurichie\" (\"the children of Tormod, son of Murchadh\"), and was descended from S\u00ecol Torcaill. The 20th century Hebridean author Alasdair Alpin MacGregor, when writing of the traditions of the flag, stated that the flag's bearers held lands on Skye near Bracadale for their services to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. The first of the flag bearers from this family was buried within the same grave as the chief of the clan, on the island of Iona. The second, and last bearer, was buried at St Clements Church, in Rodel, on Harris. This man's remains were covered by a magnificent monument; the stone coffin in which his body was placed, was six feet deep. A movable iron grate rested about two feet from the lid, and the man's body rested upon the grate. The man's male descendants were also deposited within this coffin. This meant that when a newly deceased was placed within, the bones and dust of the previous occupant were sifted through the grate into the coffin below. The writer of the manuscript stated that in the time of his own father, the last male of this family was interred this way. The tomb was then sealed by this man's daughter. The c. 1800 manuscript also noted that this family, prior to its extinction, became miserably poor."]}, {"page": "Hellisay", "response": ["Alasdair Alpin MacGregor's stories reveal a rich folklore and mythology extant on the island, possibly only a fraction of which has been preserved."]}, {"page": "Fairy Investigation Society", "response": ["During the late 1950s there were well over a hundred members, including famous individuals such as author Alasdair Alpin MacGregor, Ithell Colquhoun, Leslie Alan Shepard, RAF commander Sir Hugh Dowding, Victor Purcell, Walter Starkie (of gypsy lore fame), Naomi Mitchison and animator Walt Disney."]}, {"page": "MacGregor (surname)", "response": ["* Alasdair Alpin MacGregor (1899\u20131970), writer and photographer"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish poets", "response": ["*Alasdair Alpin MacGregor"]}, {"page": "Blue men of the Minch", "response": ["Although other storm kelpies are reported as inhabiting the Gulf of Corrievreckan, described by poet, writer and folklorist Alasdair Alpin MacGregor as \"the fiercest of the Highland storm kelpies\", the blue men are confined to a very restricted area. According to Donald A. Mackenzie they have no counterparts elsewhere in the world or even in other areas of Scotland; such limited range is rare for beliefs in spirits and demons. Folklorist and Tiree minister John Gregorson Campbell says they were unknown in Argyll on the nearby coast of the mainland for instance, although Church of Scotland minister John Brand, who visited Quarff in Shetland in mid-1700, recounts a tale of what may have been a blue man in the waters around the island. In the form of a bearded old man it rose out of the water, terrifying the passengers and crew of a boat it was following."]}, {"page": "County Books series", "response": ["|Skye and the Inner Hebrides||1953||Alasdair Alpin MacGregor", "|Western Isles||1949||Alasdair Alpin MacGregor"]}, {"page": "Chelsea Manor Street", "response": ["The designers Edward McKnight Kauffer and Marion Dorn lived at Swan Court, Chelsea Manor Street, and this is commemorated by a blue plaque placed by English Heritage in 2015.
