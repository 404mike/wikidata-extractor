The refusal of clubs to release players for international duty or not to allow a player to travel until the day before the match often disrupted the team. In his book Red Dragons: The Story of Welsh Football, Phil Stead writes that Dave Bowen often could \"not pick a side until the day of the game because he was never sure who would be available.\" The final match of the 1970 World Cup qualification group against Italy was nearly forfeited as Wales struggled to name a squad. One player, Wrexham's teenage defender Gareth Davis, was contacted in the early hours of the morning and travelled overnight to make the team's flight to Rome. The organisation of the team by the FAW was also criticised. Gary Sprake later remarked that \"the international set-up with Wales at this time was amateurish at best.\" Sprake later admitted to feigning injury under the guidance of his club manager Don Revie to avoid selection with the national side. John Toshack, who made his debut in 1969, made similar comments: \"The whole set-up was a bit of a shambles ... some of the players with more fashionable clubs were not too concerned about turning up for the less glamorous games.\" An incident in 1969 drew considerable criticism of the FAW when the organisation failed to book enough seats for the ten travelling Welsh players and the its members. When none of the officials offered to give up their seat, the crew declared that the last person to board the craft, winger Gil Reece, would have to disembark. A furious Reece was left at the airport and had to travel alone to D\u00fcsseldorf before crossing the border into East Germany."]}, {"page": "Reece (name)", "response": ["*Gil Reece (1942\u20132003), Welsh international footballer"]}]}}
