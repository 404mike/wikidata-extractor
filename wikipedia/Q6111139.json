When Atherton had himself been England captain, Agnew had led the calls for Atherton to resign over a controversy known as the \"dirt in the pocket\" affair.

The move was quite successful as all three took more 100 wickets each and Warwickshire rose nine places to third in the County Championship, though Wisden Cricketers' Almanack took the view that lack of variety in the attack was the reason the county had not won the title. Wright, with 116 wickets at an average of 21.31, was the leading wicket-taker of the three and, said Wisden, \"appeared the most dangerous and should improve\". Virtually all of Wright's career-best bowling was done in this 1962 season. Against Gloucestershire at Edgbaston, he took five for 100 and six for 91 to achieve a match analysis of 11 for 191. He bettered this later in the season with five for 87 and six for 58 \u2013 match figures of 11 for 145 \u2013 in the game against Surrey, also at Edgbaston, and these were the best match and innings figures of his career."]}, {"page": "Roly Thompson", "response": ["Following discharge in 1954, Thompson returned to Warwickshire and was a full-time professional cricketer for the next eight seasons. Yet injury, variable form and fickle selection policies meant that in only four of those eight seasons could he be regarded as a regular first-team player, a fact much commented on in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. His contemporary and fellow opening bowler Jack Bannister was quoted as saying that Warwickshire  \"did him no favours\" by preferring short-term imported players \"just at a time when an extended run in the first team would have benefited club and player\"."]}, {"page": "Keith Dollery", "response": ["Dollery was limited to second eleven fixtures and single first-class games against the touring sides in both 1951 and 1952, and his full-time cricket career did not begin in earnest until the 1953 season. Warwickshire's fast bowling was in transition, with Charles Grove past the age of 40 and Tom Pritchard in his late 30s, and Dollery was one of a group of younger players that included Jack Bannister and Roly Thompson, and others, though some were not always available because of National Service; Dollery enjoyed a good run in the first team in the first half of the 1953 season, and took 74 wickets at the respectable bowling average of 21.86 runs per wicket. His best return came in the match against Gloucestershire when he took six wickets for 38 runs in the first innings and then, bowling unchanged with Bannister, a further four for 22 in the second innings when Gloucestershire collapsed to 56 all out, Dollery taking the last three wickets in three balls, a hat-trick. Dollery's record in the 1954 season was similar, with 72 wickets at a slightly higher average of 24.75 and, again, most of his regular cricket played in the first half of the season. He was awarded his county cap in this season. In the match against Sussex, he took eight first-innings wickets for 42 runs, the best return of his career, with five of his victims clean-bowled."]}, {"page": "Ray Carter (cricketer)", "response": ["Carter first appeared in first-class cricket in non-County Championship matches in Warwickshire's Championship-winning season of 1951 and playing as a fast-medium opening bowler; he took four for 64 in the first innings of his first game, against Scotland. From 1952, he was on National Service and when he returned to Warwickshire in 1955, he faced competition for a fast-bowling place from other young bowlers, including Roly Thompson, Jack Bannister and Keith Dollery. He remained an irregular first-team player until the 1957 season, when his versatility won him a fairly regular place in the team, playing 23 matches, the most he managed in any single season. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's obituary of Carter in its 2013 edition testified to the usefulness of his different bowling styles: he \"took five for 56 against Nottinghamshire with his quicker stuff, then seven for 57 with off-cutters a fortnight later to set up victory over Gloucestershire at Bristol\". In 1957, he took 70 wickets at the somewhat high (for the time) average of 29.15; in the wet summer of 1958, he did even better from 21 matches, taking 81 wickets at 20.01. The 1958 figures included his single most successful match, the game against Somerset in which he took six for 54 in the first innings and eight for 82 in the second; the second-innings analysis was the best of his career and the 14 wickets for 136 in the match were the only time in his first-class career that he took 10 wickets or more in a game. He was awarded his county cap for his bowling in 1958."]}, {"page": "Shirley Griffiths", "response": ["Griffiths was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. After a few games in 1956, he played in about a third of Warwickshire's matches in 1957 and a similar number in 1958, but faced a lot of competition for a fast bowling place from Jack Bannister, Roly Thompson and Ray Carter. His best performances came in 1958, the best of all being seven Kent wickets for 62 runs at Edgbaston in mid-June. In early July, he took five for 37 as Middlesex were dismissed for just 77, but in a soggy summer this did not produce a victory. But when the Cambridge University bowler Ossie Wheatley was available later in the same month, it was Griffiths who made way for him and he was unable to regain his place. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack recorded that \"Griffiths, the fastest bowler, was also the most erratic and faded from the scene.\" He was not re-engaged for the 1959 season and did not play first-class cricket again."]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Jack Bannister, 85, cricket player (Warwickshire) and commentator."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2016", "response": ["*Jack Bannister, 85, English cricket player (Warwickshire) and commentator.Cricket commentator and former Warwickshire bowler Jack Bannister dies aged 85"]}]}}
