The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade. During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes. During the Great Depression the Forestry Commission's estate continued to grow so that it was just over 360,000 hectares of land by 1934.

The Commission's board was initially made up of eight forestry commissioners and was chaired by Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat from 1919 to 1927. Lovat had extensive landholdings in Scotland, and it was in the Highlands that he and other Scottish landowners such as Sir John Stirling-Maxwell conceived of the scheme of land-settlement allied to forestry. As first chairman of the Commission Lovat was able to put into practice his \u2018long cherished dream\u2019 of repopulating hill country, thanks to his good contacts in government. The scheme accordingly went ahead and created smallholdings in the new forests, of approximately ten acres (4 ha), let for \u00a315 a year. Originally 150 days work was provided in the forests, but \u201cin practice, of course, these smallholdings attracted the cream of our men whom we were glad to employ on fulltime...\u201dRyle, George, Forest Service, 1969, p. 188 Existing and often derelict agricultural dwellings were adapted and new ones built to a small number of basic designs. The scheme \u201cwas never a directly economic proposition, but in the pre-war days when motor traffic was lacking and it was much more important than today to have a solid caucus of skilled woodmen  living in the forests, the indirect benefits were inestimable. The holdings were a great success, and filled a genuine need in the countryside...\u201dRyle, op. cit. The number of smallholdings built slowed down after the Great Depression, was revived by the Special Areas programme of 1934 onwards, but then was virtually ended by the Second World War, after which the policy shifted to the building of houses without holdings.Annual Reports of the Forestry Commission, HMSO, 1920 onwards, for all figures of tenancies"]}]}}
