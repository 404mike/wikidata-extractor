His film appearances included roles in The Hand (1960) and Tiffany Jones (1973).He appeared in the Doctor Who story The Aztecs in 1964, and was interviewed for the DVD release in 2002. Five further appearances on the programme followed, the last of which was Planet of the Spiders in 1974. In  their positive review of The Crusade, the Radio Times wrote \"Walter Randall's El Akir is the most sinister character in the series to date.\"Randall died in 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Aztecs (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The bloodthirsty Tlotoxl begins to suspect Barbara is not Yetaxa returned, especially because she is trying to ban human sacrifice. He sets a series of elaborate traps for her and her companions. For example, Ian Chesterton (William Russell) has been compelled into the military and fights the strongest warrior, Ixta (Ian Cullen), to prove his ability to command the Aztec forces. Thus Ixta develops a grudge against Ian and is used by Tlotoxl to try to prove that Barbara is not Yetaxa. The Doctor unwittingly tells Ixta how to defeat Ian in combat using a drugging agent, and this battle nearly ends in the Doctor witnessing his friend's death. When this fails to be conclusive, Tlotoxl convinces the subordinate priest Tonila (Walter Randall) to make a poison for Barbara; the death of Barbara following consumption of the poison would prove she is not immortal and therefore not a god. However, Ian silently warns her from his hiding place, and Barbara refuses to drink the poison. She tells Tlotoxl that she is not Yetaxa but warns him not to tell the people.", "Keith Pyott was chosen for the role of Autloc, the High Priest of the Aztecs, while Ian Cullen and Margot Van der Burgh played Ixta and Cameca, respectively. Cullen recalled that William Hartnell \"wasn't the friendliest person, but he was trying to remember all those lines\". John Ringham, an old colleague of Crockett, was chosen to play Tlotoxl; for the character, Crockett told Ringham to \"make all the children in the country hate you\". Crockett's secretary June McMullen suggested Walter Randall for the role of Tonila, having met him at a party. Producer Verity Lambert required Randall to shave his face for the role. Martial arts expert David Anderson, who had previously appeared in Marco Polo, was cast as the Captain of the Guard. Anderson also arranged the fight between Ian and Ixta for the second episode, and acted as William Russell's stunt double in the final episode. Lucarotti used Aztec-sounding names for the characters; for example, the character Ixta was derived from the Aztec city Ixtapalapa."]}, {"page": "The Crusade (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The TARDIS materialises in 12th century Palestine during the time of the Third Crusade. When the First Doctor (William Hartnell), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), and Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) emerge, they find themselves in the middle of a Saracen ambush. In the confusion, Barbara is seized by a Saracen from behind while the rest of the TARDIS crew stop the attackers from killing William de Tornebu (Bruce Wightman), an associate of Richard the Lionheart (Julian Glover). Barbara and William des Preaux (John Flint) are presented to Saladin's brother Saphadin (Roger Avon) by El Akir (Walter Randall), who mistakenly believes them to be King Richard and his sister Lady Joanna. When des Preaux reveals their true identities, El Akir is furious; before he can act, Saladin (Bernard Kay) emerges and is intrigued by Barbara. He invites her to entertain him with her stories at supper.", "Camfield was impressed with Glover's performance in An Age of Kings in 1960, which led to his casting in the serial. Glover expressed excitement to work with Camfield, and to work with Russell again; he found Hill welcoming, but felt that Hartnell was not fond of him. When it appeared that Glover may not be available, Camfield interviewed Nicholas Courtney for the role, having known him at school in Egypt, but felt that he was not suitable. Marsh was cast as Joanna; she had previously worked with Hartnell in Will Any Gentleman...? (1953), during which she met her husband, Third Doctor actor Jon Pertwee. Adrienne Hill was also considered for the role, and read for Camfield and Lambert; they decided that she was not tall enough. Marsh recalled that she and Glover decided to act \"slightly too loving for a brother and sister\", which Lambert noticed and noted. The European actors in foreign roles were \"blacked up\" for the serial by the make-up department. Walter Randall was cast as El Akir, having been good friends with Camfield since working together on Gerry Halliday in 1951; Randall previously appeared in the series as Tonila in The Aztecs (1964). Several other actors had also appeared in previous serials, namely Marco Polo.", "Retrospective reviews were positive. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), writers Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping praised the ambition, imagination, and maturity of the storyline, noting that it \"manages to avoid racism\" but not misogyny. In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker called The Crusade a \"magnificent story\", praising Hartnell's performance in the third episode as \"one of his best and most intense performances as the Doctor\"; they also applauded Barry Newbery's set design work and Simpson's incidental music. In A Critical History of Doctor Who (1999), John Kenneth Muir wrote that The Crusade \"lacks the suspense of The Aztecs, the humor of The Romans and even the complexity of The Reign of Terror\", calling it \"the beginning of Doctor Who loss of interest in the 'purely' historical adventures\", though wrote that he enjoyed the performances of Glover and Marsh. In 2008, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times said that The Crusade was \"arguably the first story where every aspect of the production works to perfection\". He praised the decision to split up the TARDIS crew and allow the viewer to see both sides of the Crusades, and lauded the guest cast, noting that \"Walter Randall's El Akir is the most sinister character in the series to date\".
