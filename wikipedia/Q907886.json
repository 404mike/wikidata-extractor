By 1957 it employed some 300 people and in 1956 the factory produced about 2675 m2 of linoleum each week.

To cope with increasing imports of flax, timber and hemp, and exports of coal, salt and linen, between 1843 and 1846 a new wet dock and pier was built at the harbour.Glen 2007, p. 87.Omand 2000, p. 195. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer, Michael Nairn, took out a licence on Frederick Walton's patent for the production of floorcloth, and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead.Smith 1952, pp. 287\u2013288. When the patent expired in 1876, Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of linoleum. Production of both floorcloth and linoleum occupied seven factories in the town by 1883, employing 1,300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908, for another increase in linoleum and coal.Eunson 1998, p. 6.Lamont-Brown, 2002, p. 145.", "The production of heavy canvas was started in 1828 by Michael Nairn at a small factory. Influenced by a visit to Bristol, Nairn started to make floorcloth at his new factory at Pathhead in 1847, where his company pioneered the use of ovens to season the floorcloth and reduce production times.Glen 2007, p. 140. When the patent belonging to Frederick Walton expired, Nairn's were able to manufacture linoleum from 1877 onwards.Glen 2007, p. 142.

In 1855, Walton happened to notice the rubbery, flexible skin of solidified linseed oil (linoxyn) that had formed on a can of oil-based paint and thought that it might form a substitute for India rubber. Raw linseed oil oxidizes very slowly, but Walton accelerated the process by heating it with lead acetate and zinc sulfate. This made the oil form a resinous mass into which lengths of cheap cotton cloth were dipped until a thick coating formed. The coating was then scraped off and boiled with benzene or similar solvents to form a varnish. Walton initially planned to sell his varnish to the makers of water-repellent fabrics such as oilcloth, and patented the process in 1860. However, his method had problems: the cotton cloth soon fell apart, and it took months to produce enough of the linoxyn. Little interest was shown in Walton's varnish. In addition, his first factory burned down, and he suffered from persistent and painful rashes."]}, {"page": "List of people from Yorkshire", "response": ["|Frederick Walton"]}, {"page": "Travis, Staten Island", "response": ["In 1873, the American Linoleum Company acquired 300 acres in the area to build the nation's first linoleum factory. The inventor of Linoleum, Frederick Walton, spent two years in Travis setting up the factory. Many skilled English immigrants arrived to work in the factory in its early days, and the area being was named Linoleumville. By the early 20th century, 700 workers were employed, comprising half the local population. Many of these were Polish immigrants, and Linoleumville had become a Polish enclave. The plant closed in 1931 and residents overwhelmingly chose to rename the community Travis."]}, {"page": "Haughton Green", "response": ["The Church of St Mary the Virgin was dedicated in March 1876.

Originally made on a linen backing it was, however, quite rigid. Because of this, an employee called Thomas John Palmer invented a similar product which, being made from wood pulp and cotton, was lighter and more flexible.

Hallways that were in the entry hall and the stair halls were painted a somber gray so as not to compete with the surrounding rooms. Most people marbleized the walls or the woodwork. Also on walls it was common to score into wet plaster to make it resemble blocks of stone. Finishes that were either marbleized or grained were frequently found on doors and woodwork. \"Graining\" was meant to imitate woods of higher quality that were more difficult to work. There were specific rules for interior color choice and placement. The theory of \u201charmony by analogy\u201d was to use the colors that lay next to each other on the color wheel. And the second was the \u201charmony by contrast\u201d that was to use the colors that were opposite of one another on the color wheel. There was a favored tripartite wall that included a dado or wainscoting at the bottom, a field in the middle and a frieze or cornice at the top. This was popular into the 20th century. Frederick Walton who created linoleum in 1863 created the process for embossing semi-liquid linseed oil, backed with waterproofed paper or canvas. It was called Lincrusta and was applied much like wallpaper. This process made it easy to then go over the oil and make it resemble wood or different types of leather. On the ceilings that were 8\u201314 feet the color was tinted three shades lighter than the color that was on the walls and usually had a high quality of ornamentation because decorated ceilings were favored."]}, {"page": "List of people from Staten Island", "response": ["*Frederick Walton (1834\u20131928) \u2013 built first American linoleum factory in \"Linoleumville\", today's Travis"]}, {"page": "List of British innovations and discoveries", "response": ["*Linoleum \u2013 Frederick WaltonFrederick Walton : Oxford Biography Index entry"]}, {"page": "Walton (surname)", "response": ["* Frederick Walton (1834\u20131928) Industrialist and inventor of Linoleum", "* Frederick Walton (engineer) (1840\u20131925) British railway engineer"]}, {"page": "Timeline of Staten Island", "response": ["* 1875 \u2013 Frederick Walton sets up the first North American linoleum factory in Travis."]}, {"page": "Herbert Vivian", "response": ["On 30 September 1897, Vivian married Olive Walton, daughter of Frederick Walton the inventor of linoleum.
