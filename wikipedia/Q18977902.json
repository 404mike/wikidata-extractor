According to an interview with C.K. Prahalad by Des Dearlove, author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions, and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad \u2013 who was born in India and grew up there \u2013 claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation. In another report, Nancy Lockwood of Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside the home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India's 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world."]}, {"page": "Suntop", "response": ["* Suntop Media Ltd., a training and consulting company founded by Des Dearlove"]}, {"page": "Management fad", "response": ["* Crainer, Stuart and Des Dearlove, \u201cWhatever Happened to Yesterday's Bright Ideas?,\u201d Across the Board, Vol. 43, No. 3, May/June 2006, pp.\u00a034\u201340."]}, {"page": "Subir Chowdhury", "response": ["* 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017, 2019, 2021 Chowdhury was selected as one of the \"top 50 management thinkers in the world\" by Thinkers50, an organization created by Des Dearlove and Stuart Crainer.
