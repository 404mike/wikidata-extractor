He was then a Chaplain in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1943 to 1945. Following this he was Warden of King's College London's post-graduate college at Warminster, and then from 1956 Dean of King's until 1977 and his elevation to the Deanery. He died on 6 January 1988.\nEvans' career at King's made him one of the most influential churchmen of his generation; it is estimated that he trained over 1,000 priests. He was primarily a pastor and a nurturer of the potential he saw in people. He personally interviewed candidates for Theology at King's and made offers in advance of 'A'-level results. A low requirement, of perhaps only two 'A'-levels, would ensure than many men got the chance of a university education. The first year at King's was designed to sort 'the sheep from the goats', so that some would continue to the degree and ordination qualification combined (BD/AKC), with others pursuing the AKC alone for ordination.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Desmond Tutu", "response": ["At KCL's theology department, Tutu studied under theologians like Dennis Nineham, Christopher Evans, Sydney Evans, Geoffrey Parrinder, and Eric Mascall. In London, the Tutus felt liberated experiencing a life free from South Africa's apartheid and pass laws; he later noted that \"there is racism in England, but we were not exposed to it\". He was also impressed by the freedom of speech available in the country, especially at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. The family moved into the curate's flat behind the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, where Tutu assisted Sunday services, the first time that he had ministered to a white congregation. It was in the flat that a daughter, Mpho Andrea Tutu, was born in 1963. Tutu was academically successful and his tutors suggested that he convert to an honours degree, which entailed his also studying Hebrew. He received his degree from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in a ceremony held at the Royal Albert Hall."]}, {"page": "Dean of Salisbury", "response": ["*1977\u20131986 Sydney Evans"]}, {"page": "List of deans of King's College London", "response": ["* Sydney Evans (1956\u20131977) \u2013 became Dean of Salisbury"]}, {"page": "List of chaplains of King's College London", "response": ["* Sydney Evans (1945\u20131948)"]}]}}
