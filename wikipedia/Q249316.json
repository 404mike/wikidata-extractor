Daly (31 March 1943 \u2013 29 January 2004) was an Australian teacher and self-declared \"Greenhouse skeptic.\" He was known for speaking out publicly against what he called the \"Global Warming scare,\" and authored the book The greenhouse trap: Why the greenhouse effect will not end life on earth, published in 1989 by Bantam Books. After his death until 2008, his website, Still Waiting for Greenhouse was maintained by Jerry Brennan.\nDaly investigated various studies by scientists which support global warming scenarios and raised objections to them. For example, he denied that the average sea level is rising, on the basis the 'Isle of the Dead' mean ocean level benchmark.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Daly", "response": ["* John Lawrence Daly (1943\u20132004), self-declared \"Greenhouse skeptic\""]}, {"page": "John Daly (skeptic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Lawrence Daly"]}, {"page": "IPCC Third Assessment Report", "response": ["These studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900, and the MBH99 based graph featured in publicity.

Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that \"manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\". The data and methodology used to produce the \"hockey stick graph\" was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by ,,(p. 19, n1 in pdf). which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Scientific skepticism", "response": ["John Lawrence DalyStub"]}, {"page": "Daly (surname)", "response": ["*John Lawrence Daly (1943\u20132004), self-declared \"greenhouse skeptic\""]}, {"page": "John L.
