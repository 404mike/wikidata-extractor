He is known for his black and white images of post-war Scottish lives amid urban decay and redevelopment.McKenzie was born in London in 1929. During the Second World War and afterwards until 1952, McKenzie served as a photographer in the Royal Air Force. Then from 1952 until 1954, he studied photography at the London College of Printing. He initially taught photography at Saint Martin's School of Art, and was later appointed as lecturer in photography at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee where he worked until his retirement in 1986. His students nicknamed him the 'one shot wonder.' For his ability to capture the desired shot only using one frame. Joseph developed and printed all his own work. He was very influential in developing documentary photography as an art in Scotland, and notably helping establish the careers of Calum Colvin and Albert Watson.During the 1960s McKenzie's photography was exhibited widely throughout Scotland, with notably Glasgow Gorbals Children (1965), Dundee - A City in Transition (1966), Dunfermline and its People, Down among the Dead Men, Gorbals Revisited, and Caledonian Images (Scottish Arts Council, 1969). In 1970 his exhibition Hibernian Images created controversy in its depictions of the embattled lives of young people in Northern Ireland. Amid attempts to censor his work he then largely withdrew from public exhibitions.A retrospective of his work was held at the Third Eye Centre in August 1987, and published in Pages of Experience; photographs 1947-1987. Another collection, Gorbals children: A Study in Photographs was published in 1990. In 1997 an exhibition, Witness to Mortality: Photographs by Joseph McKenzie was held at the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design", "response": ["* Joseph McKenzie"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Joseph McKenzie, 86, photographer."]}, {"page": "2015 in Scotland", "response": ["* 5 July \u2013 Joseph McKenzie, photographer (born 1929)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2015", "response": ["*Joseph McKenzie, 86, Scottish photographer.'Father of modern Scots photography' Joseph McKenzie dies"]}, {"page": "Scottish photography", "response": ["In the early twentieth century, notable photographic work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn and Paul Strand. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy, Joseph McKenzie and Oscar Marzaroli. Having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the early twentieth century. In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough and Murray Johnston. More recent exponents who have received acclaim include Pradip Malde, Maud Sulter and Owen Logan."]}, {"page": "McKenzie, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph McKenzie"]}, {"page": "Shoebox Full of Secrets", "response": ["* Joseph McKenzie \u2013 front cover photography"]}]}}
