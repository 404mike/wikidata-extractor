She was born in Orford, Suffolk and named Margaret Joan Hemingway; but when she was three years old her family moved to New Zealand, where she spent her childhood. Returning to England in her teens, she read French and English at Edinburgh University and graduated MA in 1967.\nShortly after leaving university she married Michael Dias, with whom she had two daughters. The marriage broke up in the late 1970s and she moved to London. There she worked in publishing, eventually becoming Rights Manager for J.M.Dent. She had been writing poetry and prose from her youth, and in 1986 published her first novel, The Bridge, which won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize (presented for the best regional novel of the year). This story about an artist's conflict between his life and his art was made into a film in 1992.\nHer following three novels all received much critical acclaim. Victoria Glendenning wrote of her second novel, Stop House Blues (1988), that \"it has a classic quality which will ensure its survival\". Her third, The Postman's House (1991), was based on her own experiences of Czechoslovakia\nbefore the Velvet Revolution. Eyes, her final novel (1993), is also her most experimental, combining four stories of murder into a single span and reaching a chilling conclusion. Upon its release, critics commented particularly on her descriptive powers, with the Daily Telegraph insisting that \"Landscape is her forte. You can feel her weather, smell the menace in her earth.\"\nFrom 1983 until her death, Maggie Hemingway's partner was the composer David Matthews, with whom she collaborated on three vocal works:\n\nCantiga, op.45, for soprano and orchestra (1988);\nFrom Coastal Stations, op.53, for medium voice and piano (1990\u201391);\nPride, for soprano, alto, tenor and string quartet (1993).In her early 40s, Maggie Hemingway was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia. She died in London on 9 May 1993. David Matthews composed his Piano Trio No. 2, op. 61 (1993\u201394) in her memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maggie", "response": ["* Maggie Hemingway (1946\u20131993), British novelist"]}, {"page": "David Matthews (composer)", "response": ["Although he has written a fair amount of vocal music, notably a song-cycle, The Golden Kingdom, on poems of Kathleen Raine and Cantiga, a dramatic cantata on the tragic story of Inez de Castro, to a text by the novelist Maggie Hemingway (who was Matthews's partner for the last ten years of her life), Matthews's output as a whole is centred on the classical instrumental and orchestral forms. His series of (to date) thirteen string quartets is one of the most distinguished that any composer has essayed in recent years. To date he has written ten symphonies - nine of which have been commercially recorded. They, and an accompanying cluster of works such as September Music, the Serenade, two violin concertos, concertos for cello, for piano, and for oboe, the symphonic poems In the Dark Time, The Music of Dawn, A Vision and a Journey and the monumental orchestral Chaconne (inspired by a poem of Geoffrey Hill), show that he can handle large and small orchestras with skill."]}, {"page": "Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize", "response": ["|1986 || Maggie Hemingway || The Bridge "]}, {"page": "The Bridge (1992 film)", "response": ["The Bridge is a 1992 independent film based on the novel by Maggie Hemingway.
