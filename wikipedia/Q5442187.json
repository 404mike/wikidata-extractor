Born as Michael Nicholas Dodds he took the name Felix Dodds when he was 18.  He stood in Mid Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency) for the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 General Election. He has been instrumental in developing new modes of stakeholder engagement with the United Nations, particularly within the field of sustainable development. His latest book is Tomorrow's People and New Technology: Changing How We Live Our Lives. In 2019 he was the UK candidate to be the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. Dodds was the Executive Director of Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future from 1992\u20132012. He is probably best known as the author of How to Lobby at Intergovernmental Meetings: Mine is a Caf\u00e9 Latte, written with co-author Michael Strauss.\nDodds has produced a trilogy of books known as the Vienna Cafe Trilogy which covers the history of sustainable development at the global level. The third book in the series, Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals (2017), he wrote with Ambassador Donoghue and Jimena Leiva Roesch. The other two are the 2014 From Rio+20 to the New Development Agenda written with Jorge Laguna Celis and Liz Thompson and the 2012 Only One Earth \u2013 The Long Road via Rio to Sustainable Development written with Michael Strauss and Maurice Strong. The books look at the Rio+20 process and outcomes and the last forty years and the challenges for the future. His previous books include the Water, Food, Energy and Climate Nexus edited with Jamie Bartram which takes up the themes of three of his other books on human and environmental security. These are Biodiversity and Ecosystem Insecurity edited with Dr. Ahmed Djoghlaf UN Convention on Biological Diversity Executive Secretary. This is a companion book to Climate Change and Energy Insecurity, an edited volume with Andrew Higham and Richard Sherman, and Human and Environmental Security: An Agenda for Change. The books argue that the new paradigm facing the world is the interface between environmental, human, economic security considerations. Dodds believes this is due to the failure of developed countries to deliver on promises made during the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and the 2002 World Summit in Johannesburg.\nHuman and Environmental Security: An Agenda for Change was nominated for the International Studies Association Sprout Award in 2006 for the most significant publication in the field of environmental studies. In 2010 Green Eco Services listed him as one of twenty-five environmentalists ahead of their time.He has two children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Outline of green politics", "response": ["* Felix Dodds (United Kingdom; environmental author, futurist, and activist)"]}, {"page": "Maurice Strong", "response": ["In 2012 for Rio+20 he contributed to a book by Felix Dodds and Michael Strauss titled Only One Earth\u00a0\u2014 the Long Road via Rio to Sustainable Development, which reviewed the last forty years and the challenges for the future.

Initially led by Felix Dodds, the Young Liberals again challenged the party on a number of fronts. On foreign policy, they not only continued the tradition of the \"Red Guard\" in opposing the US escalation of nuclear tension, the introduction of Star Wars and the UK's independent nuclear deterrent, and continued to campaign against apartheid, but also started to green the party through both local activities and national campaigns on acid rain, nuclear power and green economics. Michael Harskin, one of the Green Guard, crafted the NLYL manifesto and the attack on the Liberal-SDP Alliance manifesto for the 1983 election. He said:", "The Young Liberals played a significant role in persuading Des Wilson, the then outgoing President of Friends of the Earth International, to become active again in the Liberal Party. Wilson went on to become party president in 1986. In an echo of the \"Red Guard\" era, the party leadership under David Steel campaigned to stop the election of Felix Dodds to the position of National Chair of the Young Liberals in 1984. Although not elected that year, he was elected the following year and played a significant role, as did the Young Liberals as whole, in helping to organise the rebellion for the 1986 Eastbourne Defence Debate.", "In his final speech as chair of the Young Liberals, Dodds called for \"a rainbow alliance on the left in British politics\". In 1988, he and other Young Liberals formed an informal alliance with leading Green Party members Tim Cooper, Jean Lambert and Liz Crosbie called Green Voice. This alliance investigated how they might be better relations and campaigns joining together members of both parties. The two Green Voice Conferences in 1988 played a key role in enabling leading MPs Simon Hughes and Michael Meadowcroft to outline to the new Social and Liberal Democratic Party the kind of green agenda that the new party should adopt. Hughes, at the press conference for the first Green Voice Conference, announced that he would not join the new Social and Liberal Democrats Party unless it was to accept a strong green agenda. In 2018, Felix Dodds published his autobiography about the Green Guards, Power to the People: Confessions of a Young Liberal Activist 1975-1987.Power to the People: Confessions of a Young Liberal Activist 1975-1987 https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/1977047246/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_J60K9RS3872YNHYK9A0J", "Some of those associated with the Green Guard, including Martin Horwood and Adrian Sanders, have gone on to become MPs, and others, including Edward Lucas, Felix Dodds and Stephen Grey, have become journalists and authors on international issues. Others have been active in the Liberal Democrat party communications department, and at 10 Downing Street (during the Coalition government) such as Olly Grender and Carina Trimingham (Chris Huhne's press and media agent).
