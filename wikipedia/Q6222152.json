From there he progressed to become a reporter. After being interviewed by several newspaper editors, Harley signed to train with Essex County Newspapers. Over three years, Harley worked at the Essex County Standard, the Braintree and Witham Times, the Maldon and Burnham Standard and the Colchester Evening Gazette. He later returned to London to work for the East London Advertiser (ELA). Harley became disillusioned with the job when his editor insisted he write a report on a shoplifter who had absentmindedly walked out with a tin of soup and a tin of baked beans. Taking advice from his union representative, he stopped wearing a tie, grew his hair and was duly sacked. Among many of Harley's peers who went on to gain successful careers in national journalism were John Blake and Richard Madeley; the latter took over Harley's desk at the ELA in 1972."]}, {"page": "Sentimental Journey (Ringo Starr album)", "response": ["Sentimental Journey received an unenthusiastic response from music critics. According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, the reaction from critics and fans was \"one of embarrassed silence\", while journalist John Blake said it was the subject of derision. In his review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus called the album \"horrendous\" but added, \"at least it's classy.\" He also wrote: \"There is a certain thrill to hearing Ringo swing immediately and finally flat on 'Stardust', reportedly Judy Agnew's favorite song. She won't like this version, which just might keep Ringo from being presented with an invitation to sing one of the nominated songs on next year's Academy Awards show.
