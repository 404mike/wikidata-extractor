This second boat was used as a trial horse against White Crusader, but the team eventually decided to use the more conventional designed boat. Tank testing was carried out at Southampton University and HMS Haslar. The deadline for acceptance of challenges was 1 April 1986 and Admiral Sir Ian Easton wrote his own personal cheque for $16,000 as an entry fee deposit. Harold Cudmore acted as skipper-tactician and starting helmsman who then handed over the helm to Chris Law for the remainder of each races. Eddie Warden-Owen was the navigator. Both boats were originally named simply Crusader One and Two but the \"White\" part of their names were added when millionaire Graham Walker (Of White Horse whiskey fame) gave heavy sponsorship to the British challengers at the last minute before the event started so the \"White\" was added to their names."]}, {"page": "1983 Louis Vuitton Cup", "response": ["Peter de Savary funded the Royal Burnham Yacht Club's Victory Syndicate.
