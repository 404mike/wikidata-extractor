Such was the internal strife during that 1998 season that England's chairman of selectors David Graveney left Cork out of the 1999 World Cup squad, citing that the issues at Derbyshire were playing too heavily on Cork's mind to allow him to play international cricket. Before the start of the 1999 season, Cork demanded the Derbyshire committee return a number of powers to the captaincy, and when his demands went unfulfilled he threatened to resign from the county altogether.  Allied with Cork in the dispute were teammates Kim Barnett and Karl Krikken. Cork carried out his threat and asked to be released from the remainder of the four seasons left on his contract.  However Derbyshire refused to terminate the contract. Six months after the dispute began, the Derbyshire committee gave into Cork's demands allowing him more say over playing matters, coupled with the departure of Andy Hayhurst and Harold Rhodes from administration positions at the county, both of whom Cork cited as making his captaincy untenable.  The internal divisions between Cork and the county management soon became public knowledge, with former players like Ian Blackwell vocal of Cork's captaincy methods and his \"negative\" impact on the dressing room. During the dispute his form began to suffer, and another injury in 2001 did not help his case.  He was awarded a benefit year in 2001, with some of his benefit events being boycotted by the Derbyshire committee; this was a season in which Cork's appearances were limited to just a handful by his England duties and return to the England one-day side."]}, {"page": "1996 English cricket season", "response": ["|Andy Hayhurst"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Andy Hayhurst (1990\u20131996) 122 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994", "response": ["After winning the toss and batting first Somerset closed the first day on 255/5, the highest scorer being opener Mark Lathwell who made 86 in nearly four hours. Following his dismissal captain Andy Hayhurst and wicket-keeper Robert Turner shared a fifth wicket stand of 100 which was ended shortly before the close. Hayhurst completed a slow-paced century on the second day, before afternoon showers led to the hosts\u2019 declaration. The wickets were shared amongst the Warwickshire bowlers but Richard Davis did take five catches, one short of a county fielding record. Warwickshire closed on 57 without loss. The third day witnessed no play because of rain so to generate a result both teams declared early on the final day leaving Warwickshire a fourth innings target of 321 from 95 overs. They were well placed on 87/1 at lunch but rain returned to wash out the afternoon session leaving the visitors 33 overs to score the 234 more needed to win. Brian Lara set about the unlikely chase by sharing partnerships of 74 in 9 overs with Paul Smith and then 126 in 14 overs with Asif Din. Lara reached his century, his fifth in consecutive innings, off 72 balls and was dismissed for 136 off 94. Warwickshire completed the victory with 20 balls remaining."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Andy Hayhurst", "|align=left|Andy Hayhurst", "|align=left|Andy Hayhurst"]}, {"page": "Hayhurst", "response": ["*Andy Hayhurst (born 1962), former English cricketer"]}]}}
