Once again, he saved a penalty during Norwich's first home Premier League fixture of the season during a 1\u20131 draw with Queens Park Rangers, although Bobby Zamora scored the rebound. He kept memorable clean sheets against Arsenal and Manchester United as Norwich won 1\u20130 on both occasions, both occurring during an outstanding run of form that saw him keep four clean sheets and concede just two goals in six matches. Unfortunately this great run of form came to an end during a 1\u20131 draw against his former club Everton when he suffered a thigh injury. He later underwent surgery, ruling him out for three months. However, Ruddy's injury later worsened, with the expectation that he would not be fit again until April. Ruddy returned to action on 7 May 2013 in Norwich's 4\u20130 Premier League win over West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed mathematical safety from relegation. He also played in Norwich's final match of the season on 19 May 2013, a 3\u20132 away win against Manchester City."]}, {"page": "Marcelo Bielsa", "response": ["On 28 April 2019, Bielsa made one of the most contentious managerial calls of the Championship season in Leeds' penultimate league game against Aston Villa at Elland Road. In the 72nd minute of a tight game between two teams who were essentially jostling for position in the playoffs, albeit Leeds 'mathematically' still able to gain automatic promotion, when Villa's Jonathan Kodjia was injured and remained on the ground, Tyler Roberts passed the ball up the line to Mateusz Klich who took it up the left wing and put the ball into the far corner past Jed Steer. The goal \u2013 the first of the game \u2013 sparked pandemonium, with Villa's Conor Hourihane, Ahmed Elmohamady, Neil Taylor and Leeds' Patrick Bamford caught up in a fracas with Klich at its centre, which involved several additional players from both sides and was eventually broken up by referee Stuart Attwell, Elland Road stewards and other players. In the immediate aftermath, Attwell sent off the peripherally involved Anwar El Ghazi with a straight red card (subsequently rescinded by The FA) and Bielsa's response to his players was, in the interests of fairness and after consulting with Villa boss Dean Smith, that his team should allow an unchallenged equaliser to be scored (the manager can be seen shouting \"Give the goal! Give the goal!\" from the touchline). From the restart, Albert Adomah essentially walked the ball into net unchallenged by 10 Leeds players, with only a frustrated and disbelieving Pontus Jansson giving chase and nearly dispossessing the forward. The game remained 1\u20131 and put the second automatic promotion spot mathematically out of reach for Leeds and see them enter the play-offs. Bielsa and the team were subsequently awarded the 2019 FIFA Fair Play Award on 23 September 2019, for their actions during this game, with the FIFA citation noting that \"The game finished 1\u20131, ultimately allowing their promotion rivals Sheffield United to guarantee their automatic spot in the Premier League, at Leeds\u2019 expense.
