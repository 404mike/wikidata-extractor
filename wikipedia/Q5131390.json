However, the \u2018information\u2019 about their own depths to which they allegedly descend is conveyed to the individuals through a work of art, a phenomenon whose ontological and phenomenological foundation relies on institutional support and social engagement \u2013 in other words, it stems from the place it occupies in a society\u2019s production structure. Also, the knowledge of \u2018the depths of the heart\u2019 comes from a composer who mastered the technique, and is not likely to use all of those fantasies to snap the audience out of their lethargy and confront them with the current problems. On the contrary, by eliminating uncertainty he induces us to \u2018descend\u2019 somewhere where \u2018eternity\u2019 overpowers current problems, and that place he calls \u2018the heart\u2019 of \u2018the spiritual.\u2019 \u017divkovi\u0107, therefore, as a creator, builds the image of a guardian of tradition who, thanks to his technical skills, transcends national boundaries, proving the \u2018propriety\u2019 and \u2018extra-temporality\u2019 of his construction of Serbian heritage, which, if adequately mediated, will demonstrate its value by closeness to universal \u2018truths\u2019.Excerpt from: M.
