He had been a glider pilot for the 6th Airborne Division during the Second World War, fighting at D-Day and Arnhem and winning the Distinguished Flying Cross. He became Secretary of Sussex after the war (as well as captain in the 1946 season) and was the player-manager and reserve wicket-keeper on the tour of the West Indies in 1947\u201348. When used as a makeshift opener on his Test debut he made 140 in six hours and later played two Tests in South Africa, the only wicket-keeper to be used between 1946 and 1959 when the great Godfrey Evans was available. The decline of amateur cricket in English county cricket and the increasing professionalism of the game led to dull, lifeless cricket as teams were determined to avoid defeat and viewed games as a job rather than entertainment (ironically the keenest cricketer on the tour was Geoff Boycott, a noted stonewaller). There had been a surge in gate receipts after the war, but this fell rapidly in the 1960s as other forms of entertainment became available to the public. Griffith had become Secretary in 1962 and oversaw the official merging of amateur and professional for the 1963 season, which prevented him from managing the MCC tour of Australia in 1962\u201363, except for one month when he flew out to relieve the Duke of Norfolk. Aware of M.J.K. Smith's natural caution the MCC gave Griffith extraordinary powers granting him overall control of cricket on the tour. Fortunately, he did not resort to these as he preferred more diplomatic means, but he urged attacking cricket in the tour games, notably against Western Australia.pp131-132, Swanton Normally the MCC manager took care of the players and social side of the tour, as there were many functions to attend.

Billy Griffith, the Secretary of the MCC replaced him as manager until he returned at the end of the year. The team travelled to Townsville, the furthest north that a MCC team had ever played a game in Australia. The wicket-keeper-captain Colin Hossack won the toss and batted, but the Queensland Country XI were all out for 165 Wilfred Brown (24) and Malcolm Campbell (40) adding 65 for the first wicket, but then they lost 7 wickets for 19 runs until John Page (31) and Hossack (25) added 39 for the eighth-wicket. David Larter took 3/39 and Ray Illingworth 3/46. By the end of the first day the MCC were 258/3 with Peter Parfitt hitting 98 in 72 minutes, winning prizes for the fastest 50 in the match and the first six to be hit. Ted Dexter, the main draw in the side, played carefully so as to be in for the Saturday, but was caught on the fence for 2. Tom Graveney made 118, David Sheppard 67, Ray Illingworth 58 and Dexter declared on 423/9 the next day. David Allen (5/57) bowled out the locals for 138 for an innings win, even though Brown made 47, having batted for 7 hours in three innings against the MCC and being hit for 21 runs off an over by the Darling Downs batsman Don Bickel, who was awarded a trophy for his 44 in 38 minutes.p22, Ian Ferguson, Cricket Fever Grips the Bush, Ashes Ablaze, Newspress Pty Ltd, 1986pp. 61-62, Moyes and Goodman"]}, {"page": "MCC tour of Australia in 1965\u201366", "response": ["The Marylebone Cricket Club tour of Australia in 1965\u201366 under the captaincy of M.J.K. Smith was its fourteenth since it took official control of overseas tours in 1903-1904. The touring team played as England in the 1965\u201366 Ashes series against Australia, but as the MCC in all other games. In all there were 24 matches; 5 Test matches (which they drew 1\u20131), 10 other first-class matches (which they won 4\u20131) and 9 minor matches (which they won 8\u20130). The strength of the team's batting and the weakness of its bowling is shown by having 10 batsmen averaging over 40, but only one bowler under 30, the part-time leg-spinner Ken Barrington. The MCC team manager Billy Griffith encouraged the naturally cautious Smith to make sporting declarations and make run-chases in the tour matches, though this became less prevalent towards the end.pp132-134and pp138-139, Swanton", "After the warm up game the MCC proceeded to Perth to play at the Western Australian Cricket Association Ground. Western Australia was the newest side in the Sheffield Shield and it would be five years before the WACA's inaugural Test in the 1970-71 Ashes series. Barrington, Boycott, and Brown were ill, and the MCC team was chosen from the 13 fit players, including the two wicket-keepers. Mike Smith loss the toss and batted even though the local captain Barry Shepherd had the habit of asking visitors to bat. Bob Barber (126), John Edrich (33) and Eric Russell (81) added a brisk 197 for the first two wickets. Smith (67 not out) and the wicketkeeper Jim Parks (107 not out) hit 175 for the six wicket and the MCC declared for 447/5 on the second morning. Bill Playle (45) and Peter Kelly (126) batted slowly to add 91 for the first wicket, but Western Australia collapsed to 303/9 with only Derek Chadwick (52 not out) offering any late resistance to the fast bowling of Jeff Jones who took five wickets for nine runs. Shepherd declared after avoiding the follow on and Edrich (45) and Peter Parfitt (48) added 75 for the third wicket, before being removed by the leg-spinner Terry Jenner (4/72). Parks and Dave Allen had hit 53 runs for the sixth wicket when Smith asked his manager Billy Griffiths when he should declare, Griffiths said \"Now\" and their 156/5 left Western Australia 274 minutes to make 301 runs for victory. David Larter (4/49) had them 53/3, with the opener Pat Kelley retired hurt after being hit on the head by a bouncer by the tall Scottish bowler. There was a short break to listen to the Melbourne Cup and Kelley returned to add 171 with Murray Vernon, the highest fourth wicket stand for Western Australia against the MCC. Though in sight of victory the hosts collapsed once Vernon was bowled for 118 by Jones (2/39), Kelly was left stranded on 108 not out, the first Western Australian to make two centuries in a match against the MCC, with no other batsman making more than 11. Western Australia were out for 291 to give the MCC a thrilling 9 run win in the last minute. \"That's the last time I take the ruddy manager's advice on a declaration\" joked Smith.p132, Swantonpp23-33, John Clarke, With England in Australia, Stanley Paul, 1966"]}, {"page": "Harry Carr (cricketer)", "response": ["A right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper, Carr made his first-class debut for HDG Leveson-Gower's XI against Oxford University in 1931.
