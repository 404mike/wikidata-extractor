Eileen steals the cheque in order to pay for the repairs to her damaged roof. Speaking to soap opera reporting magazine Inside Soap about the plot, Cleaver explained: \"Eileen's petrified because she knows what a nasty piece of work Owen is \u2013 and, at the end of the day, she's broken the law. Owen isn't a pussycat like Lloyd and Steve \u2013 he doesn't take prisoners. I think Eileen's right to be afraid!\" Cleaver later told soap opera reporting magazine Soaplife that Eileen thinks Owen \"won't miss the money\".

Cleaver said Eileen is terrified when Owen tells her he knows she has stolen the money and threatens to go to the police.
