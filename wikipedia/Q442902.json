Despite ten novels, four children's books and other works, she saw herself mainly as a poet, expecting to be remembered for her Elegiac Sonnets. She is credited with turning the sonnet into an expression of woeful sentiment. She left her husband and began writing to support their children. Her struggles for legal independence as a woman gave themes to her poetry, novels, and autobiographic prefaces. Her early novels show development in the Gothic and sentimentality. Later ones such as the controversial Desmond and The Old Manor House praised the ideals of the French Revolution. Waning interest left her destitute by 1803. Barely able to hold a pen, she sold her book collection to pay debts and died in 1806. Largely forgotten by the mid-19th century, she has since been seen as a major Romantic writer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jarndyce and Jarndyce", "response": ["Some commentators have theorised that the Jarndyce v Jarndyce case was inspired by the dispute over the will of Richard Smith, a West India merchant. When he died in 1776, the estate was tied up, and his daughter-in-law Charlotte Smith was pushed by financial necessity to write for money; she became a much-praised poet. That Chancery case has been reported to have taken 36 years to get through the court,Jacqueline M. Labbe, ed.

Turner", "response": ["thumb|right|Turner's doctoral thesis focused on Charlotte Turner Smith, an 18th-century romantic writer", "Although his work was primarily in electronics, Turner had varied interests and decided in the mid 1950s to turn his attention to literature. He earned his BA from California State College at Los Angeles in 1958 and his MA in English from the University of Southern California in 1960. He was hired in 1960 as an English professor at CSC. His 1966 thesis at U.S.C. for his PhD analyzed the life and writings of Charlotte Turner Smith.  Turner taught at California State College until 1973, but continued to publish in electronics. He died in March 1982."]}]}}
