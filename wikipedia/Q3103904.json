He came to the United States as part of a London Gaiety Company production of To-night's the Night. His Broadway career began in 1916, and he appeared in, among other productions, three George Gershwin musicals: Lady Be Good (1924), Oh, Kay! (1928) and Pardon My English (1933). He also had bit parts in silent films, such as The Mysterious Miss Terry (1917), and went on to appear in talkies and musicals in the 1930s and 1940s. He began working in Hollywood in 1937, and was frequently typecast as a genteel butler or pompous English gentleman. His film appearances included Casablanca, National Velvet, and One Hundred Men and a Girl. Smith appeared in more than one hundred movies, often in small roles, and was not always mentioned in the credits. From 1952 to 1956 he made several television appearances. He retired to the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital late in life.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Casablanca (film)", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith as the Englishman whose wallet is stolen"]}, {"page": "One Hundred Men and a Girl", "response": ["*Gerald Oliver Smith As Stevens, the butler"]}, {"page": "Mrs. Parkington", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith as Taylor "]}, {"page": "The Barbara Stanwyck Show", "response": ["*Gerald Oliver Smith"]}, {"page": "Oh, Kay!", "response": ["*The Duke \u2013 Gerald Oliver Smith"]}, {"page": "Motion Picture & Television Fund", "response": ["*Gerald Oliver Smith (1892\u20131974)"]}, {"page": "Jane Eyre (1943 film)", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith as Footman at Gateshead"]}, {"page": "Gerald Smith", "response": ["*Gerald Oliver Smith (1892\u20131974), English-born actor in the United States"]}, {"page": "Lady, Be Good (musical)", "response": ["*Bertie Bassett: Assistant to the Sheriff \u2013 Gerald Oliver Smith"]}, {"page": "Enchantment (1948 film)", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith as Willoughby"]}, {"page": "That Forsyte Woman", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith as Wilson"]}, {"page": "When You're in Love (film)", "response": ["*Gerald Oliver Smith as Gerald Meeker"]}, {"page": "Kiddie Kure", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith as Evans the butler"]}, {"page": "The Lady Escapes", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith - Reggie Farnworth"]}, {"page": "The Mysterious Miss Terry", "response": ["*Gerald Oliver Smith - John Quig"]}, {"page": "Moss Rose (film)", "response": ["* Gerald Oliver Smith as Hotel Clerk (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "The Singing Hill", "response": ["After the party, Gene explains who they are and urges Jo to return to the ranch and run it the way her grandfather did.
