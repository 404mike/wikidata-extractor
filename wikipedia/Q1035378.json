Anglo-Israelism has also been attributed to Francis Drake and King James VI and I, who believed he was the King of Israel. Adriaan van Schrieck (1560\u20131621), who influenced Henry Spelman (1562\u20131641) and John Sadler (1615\u201374), wrote in the early 17th century about his ideas on the origins of the Celtic and Saxon peoples.

Having been taken up by the king and the bishops, he had to share in their rising unpopularity. The courtiers were jealous of a foreign pensioner who was so close to the king. Casaubon was especially mortified by Sir Henry Wotton's behaviour towards him, so inconsistent with their former intimacy. His windows were broken by vandals, and his children were pelted in the streets. On one occasion he appeared at Theobalds with a black eye, having been assaulted in the street. These outrages seem to have arisen solely from the English antipathy to the Frenchman: Casaubon, though he could read an English book, could not speak English. This deficiency exposed him to insult and fraud, and restricted his social activity. It excluded him from the circle of the \"wits\"; and he was not accepted in the circle of the \"antiquaries\" like William Camden, Sir Robert Cotton and Henry Spelman."]}, {"page": "Sterling silver", "response": ["Another argument is that the Hanseatic League was the source for both the origin of its definition and manufacture, and in its name is that the German name for the Baltic is , or 'East Sea', and from this the Baltic merchants were called \"Osterlings\", or \"Easterlings\". In 1260, Henry III granted them a charter of protection. Because the League's money was not frequently debased like that of England, English traders stipulated to be paid in pounds of the Easterlings, which was contracted to sterling. and land for their , the Steelyard of London, which by the 1340s was also called Easterlings Hall, or . The Hanseatic League was officially active in the London trade from 1266 to 1597.

The claim has also been made in Henry Spelman's glossary () as referenced in Commentaries on the Laws of England by William Blackstone. Yet another claim on this same hypothesis is from William Camden, as quoted in Chamber's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts, Volume 4. By 1854, the tie between Easterling and Sterling was well-established, as Ronald Zupko quotes in his dictionary of weights."]}, {"page": "1641 in literature", "response": ["*Sir Henry Spelman \u2013 De Sepultura"]}, {"page": "1639 in literature", "response": ["*Henry Spelman (ed.) \u2013 Concilia, Decreta, Leges, Constitutiones in re Ecclesiarum Orbis Britannici (3 vols, containing many forgeries)"]}, {"page": "Droit du seigneur", "response": ["Other Scottish scholars of his era quoted Boece with approval, including John Lesley (1578), George Buchanan (1582), and Habbakuk Bisset (1626).

English scholar Henry Spelman stated in his Glossary (1664) that the custom had existed in Scotland, but not in England. English jurist William Blackstone cited Boece's statement in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765\u20131769), while similarly noting that the custom had never existed in England.Commentaries on the Laws of England, volume 1, book 1, chapter 6, p. 83. In 1776, Scottish jurist David Dalrymple disputed the existence of the custom, arguing Boece's account was purely legendary, but his position was often seen as based on Scottish patriotism. However, according to Scottish legal scholar David Maxwell Walker, instances have been recorded of the jus being claimed up to the 18th century.

During the English Reformation scholars such as Matthew Parker frequently argued that Augustine himself had been complicit in the battle and the massacre, but this contention swiftly degenerated into a sectarian dispute. The argument relies on the 604 date for the battle found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as well as the suggestion that a passage in Bede that specifically exculpates Augustine, which appears in the Latin but not in the early English translation of the text, was a later addition aimed at distancing the churchman from the violence he predicted. The usually accepted dates 615/16 for the battle mitigate this argument, as Augustine is believed to have died in 604. The charge against Augustine was challenged or rejected by scholars of the 18th and 19th century such as Elizabeth Elstob, Henry Spelman, Henry Wharton, and Jeremy Collier.

There are significant differences in spelling between A and B (for instance Spelman's use of the word hidas), indicating that the text he copied was not Recension A, but a different Latin text.

There were present at its deliberations Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Tobias, Bishop of Rochester, besides abbots, abbesses, priests, deacons and lay lords. The chief enactments are embodied in a charter whose terms secured to the Church forever the donations and privileges bestowed on it by the laity, since \"what had once been given to God might never be resumed to man's use\". Moreover, on the death of prelates, fitting successors were to be appointed with the advice and approval of the archbishop, without any royal intervention; such action would nullify the election; and lay interference was expressly disclaimed as being outside the limits of the laity's rights. The cathedral churches of Canterbury and Rochester were granted in perpetuity, immunity from royal requisitions or tribute otherwise than voluntary, and these were never to create precedent; all these privileges being secured under severe spiritual penalties for infringement. The interest and importance of this document rest on the fact that Henry Spelman and others have regarded it as the most ancient English charter.

The younger Henry Spelman was born in 1595 and left his home in Norfolk, England at age 14 to sail to Virginia Colony aboard the ship Unity, as a part of the Third Supply to the Jamestown Colony in 1609.  He is remembered for being an early interpreter for the people of Jamestown as well as writing the Relation of Virginia, documenting the first permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown, Virginia, and particularly the lifestyles of the Native Americans of the Powhatan Confederacy led by Chief Powhatan.", "Only two weeks after his arrival at the Jamestown Settlement, Spelman went with Captain John Smith on an expedition up the James River to the Indian town called Powhatan (located in the East End portion of the modern-day city of Richmond, Virginia). With Jamestown already nearly out of food provisions Smith knew that Jamestown would be unable to support the arrival of several hundred new colonists through the coming winter, and he traded young Henry Spelman's bonded servitude in exchange for the village, which was ruled by weroance Parahunt, son of Wahunsunacock (also known as Chief Powhatan.) The agreement was also for the boy to apprentice the native Powhatan language, and thus become an interpreter and serve as a messenger between the two cultures.  Young Henry Spelman was not the first boy to be traded to the Powhatans; Thomas Savage had previously been given to Powhatan by Captain Christopher Newport in 1608, and Spelman named in his writings of \"Dutchman Samuel\" (actually \"Samuel Collier\" who was John Smith's page) as another European child that lived with the Natives.", "In 1622 Opchanacanough tried to drive the English out of Virginia by attacking the settlers, killing about 330 men, women, and children. Spelman was aboard the Elizabeth trading with the natives in the Pamunkey and therefore survived the attacks. Upon his return he was called upon to renew the English alliance with the Patawomeck tribe, who were at that point detached from Powhatan's Confederacy.  In the spring of 1623, Spelman volunteered to take a group of 19 men north to the Potomac River, away from the fighting near Jamestown, to barter for corn or other food.  On 23 March 1623, the party was attacked by 60 canoes full of Anacostan Indians from their settlement of Nacochtank along the Anacostia River.  Henry Spelman and all others in his party were killed or captured in the botched trading expedition (apart from Captain Henry Fleet, who spent 5 years in captivity with them and also learned their language).  After providing much good service as an interpreter, Henry Spelman died as he had lived \u2013 amongst the Native Indians at 28 years old.  Some sources say Spelman was captured and beheaded by the Anacostans.  This attack was in reprisal for a 1622 attack by Fleet and the Patawomecks in which 18 Anacostans had been killed.", "Henry Spelman's handwritten manuscript, a Relation of Virginia was written approximately in 1613 though it was \"not deemed advisable to publish\" yet was later printed privately in 1872 by the Chiswick Press of London.
