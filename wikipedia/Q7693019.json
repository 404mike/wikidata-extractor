During war years he trained as a Physical Training Instructor, transferring from the Essex Regiment to the Army Physical Training Corps in 1941 and rose to the rank of Company Sergeant Major Instructor (CSMI) by the time of his discharge in 1946.  For most of his army life Blake was based at the Essex Regiment's depot at Brentwood.Having left the army, Blake spent the next 3 years attending courses to become a teacher.  Starting out at the Loxford School in Ilford, Essex in 1949 he soon introduced a single second-hand Nissen trampoline. Whilst at the Loxford School, Blake developed a trampoline squad of sufficient skill that they were invited to do a demonstration at the Festival of Britain in 1951. Blake remained at Loxford School until 1956 when he left to establish the UK operation of Nissen.\nBlake subsequently became Managing Director for the Nissen UK business based at their factory in Hutton Industrial Estate, Brentwood, Essex. Together with Kurt Baechler of Switzerland, Blake was credited with the introduction of trampolining to Europe.\nBeing passionate about trampolining he was not only involved in their commercial development but heavily involved in developing the competitive trampolining framework we see today.\nIt is likely that Blake was heavily involved in the UK National Championships which are credited, in 1958, with being the first televised national championships.\nIn 1964 Blake organised the first World Championships (financed by George Nissen) which were held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. That same year, following these first World Championships, he attended an inaugural meeting of prominent trampolinists in Frankfurt to discuss the formation of an International Trampoline Federation. This was launched as the (FIT) in Twickenham in 1965 and Blake became its first Vice-President, a position he held until 1967. So influential was Blake at the time that three of the first four World Championships were organised by him and held in London - at this time they took place every year.\nHaving delivered at the Senior level, Blake continued to be heavily involved in promoting competition, and in 1973 working with Bob Bollinger and George Nissen created the World Age Group Competition, which now runs alongside the World Championships every two years.Blake appeared, however, to not always be comfortable with authority and in 1972 was scathing about the FIT he had originally developed, questioning why it was so bureaucratic and gymnastics oriented in an international publication of that time.One of few Britons so honoured, in 1976 he was recognised by the United States Trampoline & Tumbling Association for his major influence on developing modern trampolining by being added to their Hall of Fame.Blake left Nissen in mid-1980 having spent many years staving off the pressure from Nissen's then-owners to cease manufacturing trampolines because of fears of litigation.  They had previously ceased manufacture in USA many years before for this very reason.  Blake continued to give talks and lectures, however and soon became a leading light in the UK Leisure Management Industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blake (surname)", "response": ["*Ted Blake (1921\u20131998), British inventor"]}, {"page": "Trampolining", "response": ["The first individual trampolining competitions were held in colleges and schools in the US and then in Europe.  In the early years of competition there was no defined format with performers often completing lengthy routines and even remounting if falling off partway through. Gradually competitions became more codified such that by the 1950s the 10-bounce routine was the norm thereby paving the way for the first World Championships which were organised by Ted Blake of Nissen, and held in London in 1964.

Blake also used the first WAG as an opportunity to organise a World Trampoline Safety Conference which was held in the Bloomsbury Hotel, London, in order to codify safety concerns.

After the war Nissen continued to promote the trampoline and began touring in Europe and later the Soviet Union promoting both the sport of \"rebound tumbling\" and his trampoline equipment. Nissen set up a manufacturing plant for his company in England in 1956 headed up by Ted Blake an English trampoline pioneer, first in Hainault then Romford and finally Brentwood, Essex by the mid-1960s, and manufactured trampolines there for many years. Brentwood still has a thriving trampolining community but no longer a local factory. But by the late 1970s other manufacturers had started to make similar equipment and eventually, although the word trampoline was originally a trademark, it became a generic word for rebound apparatus.
