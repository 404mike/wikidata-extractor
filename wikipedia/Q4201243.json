Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \"Throb\" Young.", "Bobby Gillespie moved to Mount Florida in southeastern Glasgow, where he attended King's Park Secondary School, where he first met Robert Young. Another schoolfriend was Alan McGee, who took Gillespie to his first gig, a Thin Lizzy concert. McGee and Gillespie were heavily influenced by punk rock, and they joined a local punk band, The Drains, in 1978. The Drains' guitarist was a 15-year-old Andrew Innes. The band was short-lived, and Innes and McGee moved to London while Gillespie chose to remain in Glasgow.", "*Andrew Innes \u2013 guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1987\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Creation Records", "response": ["McGee formed Creation Records following the culmination of various projects, including fanzine Communication Blur, his own rock outfit The Laughing Apple (with future Primal Scream guitarist and long-time friend Andrew Innes), and his running of the venue The Communication Club.

Primarily the label was in opposition to the \"manufactured\" synth pop of the era, that bore little resemblance to the work of his favourite acts including Public Image Ltd and the Sex Pistols.Yates, Brendan, Out of the Void; The Primal Scream Story (2003), p. 21"]}, {"page": "Bobby Gillespie", "response": ["The band signed to Creation Records in 1985, and over the next year, they released a pair of singles.

The B-side \"Velocity Girl\" wound up on NME's C86 cassette compilation, a collection of underground pop groups that defined the UK's mid-'80s indie pop scene. After the band rejected the initial version of debut album, Sonic Flower Groove, recorded with Stephen Street, they re-recorded the album with Mayo Thompson, and the record was released in 1987 on the Creation subsidiary Elevation.
