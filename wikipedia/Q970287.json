It was the first year of the Perrier Award (now known as the Edinburgh Comedy Awards). The alternative comedy scene was also beginning to take shape. Previously, comedy at the Fringe had taken the form of student revues. Now stand-up was becoming a feature. According to Alexei Sayle, \"The Fringe then was entirely University revues and plays; there was not a single piece of stand-up comedy until me and Tony [Allen] arrived.\" Comedy began an ascent which would see it become the biggest section of the programme by 2008."]}, {"page": "Konrad Kujau", "response": ["In 2006, someone claiming to be his grandniece, Petra Kujau, was charged with selling \"fake forgeries\", cheap Asian-made copies of famous paintings with forged signatures of Konrad Kujau. Kujau was portrayed in the 1991 miniseries Selling Hitler by actor Alexei Sayle. The series also featured Jonathan Pryce as Gerd Heidemann and Tom Baker as Stern executive Manfred Fischer. He was also portrayed in the German film Schtonk! (1991) by Uwe Ochsenknecht."]}, {"page": "Jeremy Corbyn", "response": ["In November 2019, British intellectuals, writers and artists urged voters in a letter published in The Guardian to reject Corbyn in the impending general election, alleging an \"association with antisemitism\". The Labour Party responded by noting their own commitment to rooting out antisemitism and robust action dealing with it and that several of the signatories had themselves been accused of antisemitism, Islamophobia and misogyny and/or were Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Another letter, supportive of Corbyn and published in the NME, was signed by thirty high profile figures, including Noam Chomsky, Brian Eno, Naomi Klein, Lowkey, Thurston Moore, Robert Del Naja, Maxine Peake, Mark Ruffalo, Mark Rylance, Alexei Sayle, Roger Waters, Vivienne Westwood and Yanis Varoufakis. The letter describes Corbyn as a \"life-long committed anti-racist\" and says that \"no political party or political leader has done more to address (antisemitism) than Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party.\" A further letter in support of Corbyn, from a number of British Jews, mainly eminent academics, was published in The Guardian a few days later."]}, {"page": "The Comedy Store (London)", "response": ["Among the original line-up who made their reputations here were Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, French & Saunders, Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson who in 1980 led these pioneers to establish the breakaway Comic Strip team elsewhere in Soho. All were to prove influential in reshaping British television comedy throughout the 1980s as stars of The Comic Strip Presents."]}]}}
