Mitrovi\u0107 began the season in fine form, scoring five goals in six matches. In October, he went on another scoring run with six goals in five matches, including a hat-trick against Luton Town. He was later named Championship Player of the Month, tying the record with former teammate Dwight Gayle. He kept scoring throughout November and December, but on 11 January 2020, in a match against Hull City, he damaged his ankle ligaments and was ruled out for two to three weeks. He returned on 1 February against Huddersfield Town and scored Fulham's third goal in a 3\u20132 home win. This kickstarted another scoring run during the month, culminating with a stoppage-time winner over Swansea City, despite having his penalty saved by Freddie Woodman in the 89th minute. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mitrovi\u0107 did not play for Fulham until the Championship resumed in June, and would be retrospectively banned for three matches for elbowing Benjamin White in the club's 3\u20130 loss to Leeds United. On 10 July, Mitrovi\u0107 returned to the team, winning and converting a penalty in a 2\u20130 win over Cardiff City. On 18 July, Mitrovi\u0107 scored twice and assisted for Bobby Decordova-Reid, in a 5\u20133 win over Sheffield Wednesday, to keep Fulham's slim hopes of automatic promotion alive. Like the 2018\u201319 season, the club missed out on the final day, drawing 1\u20131 with Wigan Athletic. Mitrovi\u0107 finished the season with twenty-six goals, alongside Brentford's Ollie Watkins; he won the physical version of the award as he scored the same amount of goals in less minutes than Watkins. He did not appear in either legs of the play-off semi-final, but he played a part in the play-off final, providing the assist for Joe Bryan's second goal in Fulham's extra-time win over Brentford. On 3 September, he was named the Player of the Season by the club's supporters."]}]}}
