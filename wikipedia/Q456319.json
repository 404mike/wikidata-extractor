A Billboard review considered the song as \"an empowering anthem in which the singer claims 'bitch' to be an acronym for 'being in total control of herself'\", while commenting Franc sings the lines \"You were too fly then, so fly away now\" with \"an aggressive, feisty vocal\". Pitbull's verses were also praised, being considered as \"forceful and energetic rhymes\". Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a mixed review, commenting that \"calling your debut single 'Now I'm That Bitch' is a crass but effective way for a pop starlet to grab our attention - even if she proceeds to cushion the blow by claiming it's an acronym for 'Being In Total Control Of Herself', and even if 'Bitch' has to become 'Chick for the purposes of daytime radio.\" However, Levine noted \"the track itself doesn't quite live up to its risqu\u00e9 title\", describing its lyrics as \"sassy enough\" and its composition as \"a fairly standard slab of electro-R&B complete with box-ticking cameo from Pitbull. Aside from the cuss word, the only intrigue comes from trying to work out whether Franc actually sings 'I'm not a bender' on the second verse.\" Pip Ellwood of Entertainment Focus said \"Now I\u2019m That Bitch\" \"isn\u2019t a good single. Livvi Franc is not the next big thing\", while describing the song basically as a \"modern R&B/pop by numbers.
