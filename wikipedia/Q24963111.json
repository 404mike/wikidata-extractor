The show premiered in the UK in 2015 and was cancelled in 2016, to which fans reacted by petitioning ITV to reinstate the popular drama, to no avail. It played in the US on PBS's Masterpiece in 2016 and 2017, where viewers were similarly disappointed to learn of the show's demise. The series creator, Simon Block, has stated he intends to continue the story in written form, as novels.
