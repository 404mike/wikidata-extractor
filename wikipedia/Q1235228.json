He was a Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, and became rector of the parish of Church Stretton, Shropshire, and, later professor of Divinity at Cambridge. In 1760, one year after Handel was buried in Westminster Abbey he published anonymously a biography 'Memoirs of the Life of the Late George Frederic Handel'.More than half of this biography is focused on the years before 1712, when Handel moved to London. Therefore, it is supposed he received information from Handel himself on his early life or from John Christopher Smith. The Catalogue and the Observations are additions to the Memoirs by other authors. Charles Jennens owned a copy of the Memoirs, and provided the book with critical remarks on Semele and Benedetto Pamphili.\nIn 1761 Johann Mattheson published an extended translation with sharp remarks on the biography of Mainwaring.\nFacsimile reprints of the \"Memoirs\" were published in 1964 and 1975.", "link_mentions": {}}}
