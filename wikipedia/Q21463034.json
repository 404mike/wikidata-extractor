Ladbrooke contributed fourteen works to its first exhibition in 1805. In 1808, when Crome became president, Ladbrooke was elected as vice-president. In 1816, Ladbrooke, along with Joseph Stannard, John Thirtle and five other members of the Norfolk Society, having ineffectually urged a modification of some of the rules, seceded from the society, but this venture ultimately failed and was abandoned after three years. Between 1804 and 1815 Ladbrooke was an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy, and until 1822 he exhibited works at the British Institution.

The following year he accompanied Crome and the dealer William Barnes Freeman on a visit to Paris to view the treasures of the Louvre, possible now that the Napoleonic Wars in Europe were at an end. During the visit Crome made sketches and bought works produced by French artists, which the group managed to smuggle back to England. The first exhibition of the Norwich Society, in 1805, marked the start of the Norwich School of Painters. In the exhibition, 223 works were shown by eighteen different exhibitors, including Coppin.

He was the son of the amateur artist Charles Hodgson, whom he accompanied on a tour of Wales in 1805, when he was seven. He was taught art by John Crome at Norwich Grammar School.", "David Hodgson, the son of Charles Hodgson and his wife Nanny Chiswell from North Walsham, was born in Great Yarmouth on 13 June 1798 and baptised at the town's parish church on 18 June.David Hodgson in \"Bishop's transcripts for Yarmouth\", FamilySearch (David Hodgson)  His father was a school master and amateur artist, who actively encouraged his son to develop his artistic talents. Few details of David Hodgson's early life are known. In 1805 the seven-year-old boy accompanied his father on a tour of Wales, which included a stay in Chester and may have included a trip to Liverpool to visit relatives. He attended Norwich Grammar School, where he was taught drawing by John Crome and mathematics by his father. Like his father, he was a steady supporter of Crome, even comparing him artistically to Robert Burns.", "In 1856 Charles Hodgson died in Liverpool, and David Hodgson continued his father's practise as an art master at the Grammar School. He moved from Tombland in the city centre to nearby Greyfriars' Lane, off what is now Upper King Street.", "Hodgson was more literary and articulate than many of his contemporaries. His Lessons on Perspective were published in the Norwich Mercury on 20 July 1822, he wrote an unpublished memoir about the life of his father, now kept in the British Museum, which outlined Charles Hodgson's career, and he also had his own poetry published. His letters to the local press included one to the Norwich Mercury dated 4 August 1858, about Norwich's civic portrait collection. His surviving correspondence shows that he was a strong advocate for the arts in Norwich, and was among the first to write about the Norwich School of painters as an identifiable entity.", "* Copies of this work are held at the Millennium Library in Norwich. The preface contains tributes by Hodgson to John Crome, Robert Ladbrooke, George Vincent, James Stark, John Berney Crome, John Sell Cotman and Charles Hodgson."]}]}}
