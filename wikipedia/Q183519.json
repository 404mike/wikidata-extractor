Rosen further exemplified Carey's influence by drawing a parallel with American Idol, which to her, \"often played out as a clash of melisma-mad Mariah wannabes. And, today, nearly 20 years after Carey's debut, major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of Britain's X Factor show, Leona Lewis, with her Generation Next gloss on Mariah's big voice and big hair.\" New York Magazines editor Roger Deckker further commented that \"Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma (the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty) to the charts, but it was Mariah\u2014with her jaw-dropping range\u2014who made it into America's default sound.\" Deckker also added that \"Every time you turn on American Idol, you are watching her children.\" As Professor Katherine L. Meizel noted in her book, The Mediation of Identity Politics in American Idol, \"Carey's influence not just stops in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabe's, it's also her persona, her diva, her stardom which inspires them... a pre-fame conic look.\"", "Carey has inspired singers and songwriters all over the world.
