The team finished in second place in the county championship that year, but dropped to eighth place in 1960. Discontent with his captaincy led the county to replace him after the end of the 1960 season with Tom Pugh, a less talented batsmen who (according to The Times) was \"a young and inexperienced amateur who was barely worth his place in the side\". Graveney left Gloucestershire on discovering that it had been decided when giving the captaincy to Graveney that Pugh would be his successor. This meant that Graveney did not play first-class cricket in 1961, as Gloucestershire required him to meet the residence qualification for his new club, Worcestershire, before being allowed to play for them. His performances for Worcestershire in 1962 led to his recall to the England team, where he scored two centuries and averaged 100 in the series against Pakistan, but he failed again on the winter tour of Australia and was dropped.  He helped Worcestershire win the county championship in 1964 and 1965, the first time that they had done so, and reached the landmark of one hundred first-class centuries in 1964 (the 15th person, and the first player starting his career after the Second World War, to do so)."]}, {"page": "Ken Graveney", "response": ["In 1962, he reappeared in a few second eleven matches and, on the resignation as county captain of Tom Pugh at the end of that season Graveney was appointed to lead the county side in 1963 and 1964. With a talented side of bowling all-rounders, including the England players David Smith, John Mortimore and David Allen, Graveney bowled very little and at a very gentle medium pace and batted low down the order. The side finished eighth in 1963, but he retired as captain after a notably unsuccessful season in 1964 when Gloucestershire finished at the bottom of the County Championship."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire cricket captains", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" align=\"left\" | Tom Pugh "]}, {"page": "John Pugh (cricketer)", "response": ["He died at Hastings, Barbados, on 14 February 1964.

His cavalier batting style rarely led to long innings and he never scored more than three centuries in any single season; after 1954, he made only one further century in four-and-a-half years of regular county cricket. He was, according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002, \"like a fiery Viking, smiting and walloping in the Essex cause\". In the wet 1958 season his aggregate was just 1075 runs and his average had declined to 21.93; he was, with Dennis Brookes and Jack Robertson, by this stage one of only three cricketers to have achieved 1000 runs in each postwar season. In the 1959 season, the young opening batsman Les Savill enjoyed a highly successful start to the season and Dodds dropped out of the Essex first team in mid-season. After a few second eleven games, he did not regain his place and he retired from regular cricket at the end of the season. He reappeared in single matches for MCC in both 1960 and 1961, in the first of these scoring 75 and 41 against Cambridge University and sharing a fast opening partnership of 100 with Tom Pugh that lasted just an hour."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Tom Pugh (1960)"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Tom Pugh, 78, cricketer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2016", "response": ["*Tom Pugh, 78, English cricketer.Farewell Tom Pugh \u2013 13 March 1937 to 1 February 2016 "]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Tom Pugh (1960) : C.
