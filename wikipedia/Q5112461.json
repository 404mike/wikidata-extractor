Until his retirement in 2009, he was Student and Tutor in Modern History at Christ Church, Oxford and University Lecturer at Oxford University.  He was educated at Churchill College, Cambridge and the University of Manchester. Haigh was a very influential revisionist in Tudor historiography and on the English Reformation. Haigh's writings mostly demonstrated that, contrary to orthodox understandings of the English Reformation, religious reform was extremely complex and varied considerably at a parish level. Haigh has also been noted for his work in diminishing the significance attributed to anticlericalism prior to 1530. His revisionism formed part of a broader wave in Tudor historiography with other historians such as Eamon Duffy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mary I of England", "response": ["Mary is remembered in the 21st century for her vigorous efforts to restore the primacy of Roman Catholicism in England after the rise of Protestant influence during the previous reigns. Protestant historians have long deplored her reign, emphasizing that in just five years she burned several hundred Protestants at the stake. In the mid-20th century, H. F. M. Prescott attempted to redress the tradition that Mary was intolerant and authoritarian, and scholarship since then has tended to view the older, simpler assessments of Mary with increasing reservations.Weikel.

This division began during the reign of her father, Henry VIII. After his wife, Catherine of Aragon, failed to produce a male heir, Henry applied to the pope for an annulment of his marriage. When his request was denied, Henry separated the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church and claimed that he, rather than the pope, was its supreme head on earth. Under Elizabeth's half-brother, Edward VI, the Church of England became more explicitly Protestant, projecting a \"restrained\" Calvinism, in the words of historian Christopher Haigh.", "In his \"Puritan Choir\" thesis, historian J. E. Neale argues that Elizabeth wanted to pursue a conservative policy but was pushed in a radical direction by a Protestant faction in the House of Commons.For a summary of Neale's thesis, see . This theory has been challenged by Christopher Haigh, who argues that Elizabeth wanted radical reform but was pushed in a conservative direction by the House of Lords. Haigh argues that the Act of Uniformity \"produced an ambiguous Book of Common Prayer: a liturgical compromise which allowed priests to perform the Church of England communion with Catholic regalia, standing in the Catholic position, and using words capable of Catholic interpretation\". This made it easier for priests to \"counterfeit\" the Mass without risking arrest.", "Gradually, England was transformed into a Protestant country as the Prayer Book shaped Elizabethan religious life. By the 1580s, conformist Protestants (termed \"parish anglicans\" by Christopher Haigh and \"Prayer Book protestants\" by Judith Maltby) were becoming a majority. Efforts to introduce further religious reforms through Parliament or by means of Convocation were consistently blocked by the Queen. The Church of England's refusal to adopt the patterns of the Continental Reformed churches deepened conflict between Protestants who desired greater reforms and church authorities who prioritised conformity."]}, {"page": "Albert Pollard", "response": ["Some of Pollard's speculations are nowadays generally discredited by the revisionist school of history led by academics such as Christopher Haigh. For example, he put forward the thesis that English foreign policy from 1514 to 1529 was motivated by Thomas Wolsey's desire to become Pope. Pollard is identified with the Whiggish school of history, along with his student, J. E. Neale. They saw Henry VIII as a vigorous reformer who led England out of obscure medieval ways and into the modern world."]}, {"page": "Puritan choir", "response": ["The historian Norman Jones has, however, argued that the 'Puritan Choir' is a misinterpretation of evidence. He maintains that in framing the religious settlement, Elizabeth faced opposition not from the forty-three alleged Puritans in the House of Commons, but rather from Catholic resistance and conservatism in the House of Lords which she and Cecil had underestimated.N. L. Jones, Faith by Statute 1982 The influence that the 'Puritan Choir' could have feasibly had on the Elizabethan Religious Settlement has also been questioned by Haigh. Of the forty-three individuals named as part of 'our choir' in Neale's document, only twenty-two of them were definitely Protestants. Furthermore, only nineteen Marian exiles were elected to the 1559 parliament, and some were unable to play any role in the Parliamentary session as they returned too late.Christopher Haigh, Elizabeth I 1998  The influence of the twenty identifiable Catholics in the 1559 House of Commons is also ignored under Neale's 'Puritan Choir' thesis.Susan Doran, Elizabeth I and Religion, 1558-1603 1994,"]}, {"page": "John Bird (bishop)", "response": ["He then was appointed as the inaugural Bishop of Chester. The new diocese had both administrative and financial problems: Bird tried to address the finances, and dispensed with archdeacons, but succeeded only in making disadvantageous agreements with the Crown and with leaseholders.Christopher Haigh, Reformation and Resistance in Tudor Lancashire (1975), pp. 7-10."]}, {"page": "English Reformation", "response": ["The confiscations caused tensions between Protestant church leaders and Warwick, now Duke of Northumberland. Cranmer, Ridley and other Protestant leaders did not fully trust Northumberland. Northumberland in turn sought to undermine these bishops by promoting their critics, such as Jan Laski and John Knox. Cranmer's plan for a revision of English canon law, the Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum, failed in Parliament due to Northumberland's opposition. Despite such tensions, a new doctrinal statement to replace the King's Book was issued on royal authority in May 1553. The Forty-two Articles reflected the Reformed theology and practice taking shape during Edward's reign, which historian Christopher Haigh describes as a \"restrained Calvinism\". It affirmed predestination and that the King of England was Supreme Head of the Church of England under Christ.", "Historian Eamon Duffy writes that the Marian religious \"programme was not one of reaction but of creative reconstruction\" absorbing whatever was considered positive in the reforms of Henry VIII and Edward VI. The result was \"subtly but distinctively different from the Catholicism of the 1520s.\" According to historian Christopher Haigh, the Catholicism taking shape in Mary's reign \"reflected the mature Erasmian Catholicism\" of its leading clerics, who were all educated in the 1520s and 1530s. Marian church literature, church benefactions and churchwarden accounts suggest less emphasis on saints, images and prayer for the dead. There was a greater focus on the need for inward contrition in addition to external acts of penance. Cardinal Pole himself was a member of the Spirituali, a Catholic reform movement that shared with Protestants an emphasis on man's total dependence on God's grace by faith and Augustinian views on salvation.", "There is debate among historians over how vibrant the restoration was on the local level. According to historian A. G. Dickens, \"Parish religion was marked by religious and cultural sterility\", though historian Christopher Haigh observed enthusiasm, marred only by poor harvests that produced poverty and want. Recruitment to the English clergy began to rise after almost a decade of declining ordinations.  Repairs to long-neglected churches began. In the parishes, \"restoration and repair continued, new bells were bought, and church ales produced their bucolic profits\". Great church feasts were restored and celebrated with plays, pageants and processions. However, Bishop Bonner's attempt to establish weekly processions in 1556 was a failure. Haigh writes that in years during which processions were banned people had discovered \"better uses for their time\" as well as \"better uses for their money than offering candles to images\". The focus was on \"the crucified Christ, in the mass, the rood, and Corpus Christi devotion\".", "Around 284 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. Several leading reformers were executed, including Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, Nicholas Ridley, John Rogers, John Hooper, Robert Ferrar, Rowland Taylor, and John Bradford. Lesser known figures were also among the victims, including around 51 women such as Joan Waste and Agnes Prest. Historian O. T. Hargrave writes that the Marian persecution was not \"excessive\" by \"contemporary continental standards\"; however, \"it was unprecedented in the English experience\". Historian Christopher Haigh writes that it \"failed to intimidate all Protestants\", whose bravery at the stake inspired others; however, it \"was not a disaster: if it did not help the Catholic cause, it did not do much to harm it.\" After her death, the Queen became known as \"Bloody Mary\" due to the influence of John Foxe, one of the Marian exiles. Published in 1563, Foxe's Book of Martyrs provided accounts of the executions, and in 1571 the Convocation of Canterbury ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land.", "Revisionists comprise a third school, led by Christopher Haigh, Jack Scarisbrick and numerous other scholars.  Their main achievement was the discovery of an entirely new corpus of primary sources at the local level, leading them to the emphasis on Reformation as it played out on a daily and local basis, with much less emphasis on the control from the top. They emphasize turning away from elite sources, and instead rely on local parish records, diocesan files, guild records, data from boroughs, the courts, and especially telltale individual wills."]}, {"page": "William Downham", "response": ["Struggles for influence within the commission undermined its effectiveness as an instrument of governance but, from its inception, Downham was as assiduous in attending its sessions as he was regular in his presence at proceedings of his consistory court.Cox,\u00a0Reformation Responses, pp. 304-305. In 1564 he compiled a perceptive and candid assessment of the magistracy on whom the enforcement of law was dependent within his diocese, concluding that, of twenty-five justices of the peace in Lancashire, only six could be trusted in religion and of these two were doubtful.Christopher Haigh,\u00a0Reformation and Resistance in Tudor Lancashire, Cambridge University Press, 1975,\u00a0pp. 212-213; Wark,\u00a0\"Elizabethan Recusancy\",\u00a0p. 8.
