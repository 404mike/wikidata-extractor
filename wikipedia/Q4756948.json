In 2018, she engaged in small talk with Alastair Bruce of Crionaich for the television documentary The Coronation. In 2006, the Queen had been filmed having a conversation with the later-disgraced Australian artist and media personality Rolf Harris while he painted her portrait. It ventured little beyond talk of previous portraits of the Queen and royal art history in general, and the Queen's responses to Harris's overtures were notably crisp and monosyllabic. She had a more jovial on-camera exchange with the painter Andrew Festing while sitting for a portrait in the 1992 BBC documentary Elizabeth R, directed by Edward Mirzoeff on the 40th anniversary of her accession."]}, {"page": "Matthew Festing", "response": ["Festing was the youngest of four sons born to Field Marshal Sir Francis Festing, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, (Archived: 12 May 2008) a Roman Catholic convert who became a Knight of Malta, and Mary Cecilia (n\u00e9e Riddell), the elder daughter of Cuthbert David Giffard Riddell of Swinburne Castle, Northumberland.
