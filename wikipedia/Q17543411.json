As a child he attended Sedbergh School along with his brother Christopher Chippindale, now an archaeologist.He worked initially for The Guardian newspaper and was sent to Belfast at the height of The Troubles. Chippindale reported on the Birmingham Six trial and that of the Guildford Four and \"he thought they'd got the wrong men in both cases\". His suspicions convinced Chris Mullin to investigate and led eventually to their acquittal.In 1981 he worked on documentaries for London Weekend Television's The London Programme. He was news editor for the left wing News on Sunday and charted its demise with fellow ex-employee Chris Horrie in their book Disaster: The Rise and Fall of News on Sunday.Chippindale co-wrote the \"savagely funny\" book Stick It Up Your Punter!,  a history of Rupert Murdoch's The Sun with Chris Horrie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Screaming Lord Sutch", "response": ["In 1991 his autobiography, Life as Sutch: The Official Autobiography of a Raving Loony (written with Peter Chippindale), was published.

During this action several demonstrators were left on the ground; one of those was Kevin Gately. Because of his height, his was caught on press photographs with fellow students from Warwick; they had been marching behind the IMG group. The last photograph of him alive shows him unscathed, facing up Old North Street and retreating with other students; the photograph was taken before the IMG's second surge towards the police cordon. He was next seen separately by Gerrard and the journalist Peter Chippindale, lying unconscious on the floor as the retreating ranks of people stepped over him. There were no witnesses or other evidence to suggest what happened to Gately between the final photograph and him being on the floor. Gately was picked up by the police and taken to a nearby St John Ambulance post, where he was treated before being taken to University College Hospital; he died four hours later. Gately was the first death during a demonstration in Britain for 55 years.", "That evening and in the following weeks, the media reported and commented on the events in the square. Nearly all the mainstream media agreed that the initial clash between marchers and the police was a deliberate attack by the IMG, while many blamed the police for the clash at the junction of Theobalds Road and Southampton Road. One of those newspapers that followed that line was The Guardian, whose headline reported \"Left wing deliberately started violence\". The report, by the journalists Peter Chippindale and Martin Walker, said of the first surge by IMG marchers into the police cordon, \"We are in no doubt at all that at this point the marchers around the banner deliberately charged the police cordon\". The only journalistic sources that blamed the police for the violence were those from the hard-left newspapers; the Socialist Worker carried the headline \"Murdered... By Police\"."]}, {"page": "Now (British TV channel)", "response": ["The Now channel was originally designed to be a live 24-hour news channel, similar to CNN and Sky News, with its content provided by ITN.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  Between the awarding of the franchise and the launch of the channel, ITN withdrew its involvement with BSB after failing to reach an agreement on how to provide its news servicePeter Chippindale, Suzanne Franks and Roma Felstein, Dished!: Rise and Fall of British Satellite Broadcasting (London: Simon & Schuster Ltd, 1991) and the Now channel's remit was changed to a mix of daytime lifestyle shows, current affairs programming, and arts programmes at weekends.

The focus of this journey is the Kaaba, a small rectangular building around which a huge mosque has been built. This pilgrimage, known as the Hajj, begins two months after Ramadan each year. Dressed in symbolically simple clothing, Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times, often followed by a drink from the Zamzam Well. Next, a symbolic search for water is performed by travelling back and forth between two nearby peaks. On the eighth day of the month, the pilgrims travel to Mina in the desert and spend the night in tents. The following day, over two million Muslims gather on the slopes of Mount Arafat, where the afternoon is spent in prayer. The Feast of Sacrifice, celebrated by Muslims worldwide, is performed by pilgrims in Mina the next day, and includes the slaughter of an animal. Finally, the pilgrims perform a ritual Stoning of the Devil by tossing pebbles at three pillars. Classic Islamic law details the manner in which the pilgrim dresses, behaves, arrives, departs and performs each of these rituals.al-Misri, Ahmad ibn Naqib (edited and translated from Arabic (with commentary) by Nuh Ha Mim Keller) (1994 revised edition). pp. 297\u2013370.Horrie, Chris; Chippindale, Peter Chippindale (1991). pp. 39\u201343."]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Peter Chippindale, 69, newspaper journalist (The Guardian) and author."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2014", "response": ["*Peter Chippindale, 69, British newspaper journalist (The Guardian) and author.Peter Chippindale obituary"]}, {"page": "Chippindale", "response": ["*Peter Chippindale (1945\u20132014), British newspaper journalist and author"]}, {"page": "Chippindale, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Chippindale"]}]}}
