In the 1970s and into the 1980s, as the series gained cult status a large amount of fan produced material began to appear, with the official appreciation society forming in 1977. In 1988, the first officially sanctioned guide \u2013 The Prisoner Companion \u2013 was released. It was not well received by fans or Patrick McGoohan. In 1989, Oswald and Carraze released The Prisoner in France with a translated version appearing shortly after. From the 1990s, numerous other books about the TV series and Patrick McGoohan have been produced. Robert Fairclough's books - including two volumes of original scripts - are considered some of the best researched books available. For the 40th anniversary, Andrew Pixley wrote a well-received and in depth account of the series' production. There are guides to shooting locations in Portmeirion and also a biography of co-creator George Markstein. Some members of the production crew have released books about their time working on the series including Eric Mival and Ian Rakoff. Roger Langley the organiser of the Six of One The Prisoner appreciation society has published several books, guides and novels inspired by the TV series (including Patrick McGoohan: Danger Man or Prisoner? first published in 2007 and revised and updated in 2017 with input from Catherine McGoohan)."]}, {"page": "List of The Prisoner episodes", "response": ["* \"Ticket to Eternity\" by Eric Mival (synopsis included in Volume 1)", "* \"Friend or Foe\" by Eric Mival (synopsis included in Volume 1)"]}, {"page": "Living in Harmony (The Prisoner)", "response": ["With script editor George Markstein having quit the project after 13 episodes, taking his team of writers with him, McGoohan and Tomblin asked the production crew to submit ideas for further episodes. Music editor Eric Mival submitted two ideas (\"Friend or Foe\" and \"Ticket to Eternity\"), and assistant editor Ian Rakoff, film librarian Tony Sloman, and assistant director John O'Connor one each. Only Rakoff's storyline was accepted, and as a result McGoohan commissioned him to write the episode. For the theme of the episode, Rakoff drew largely upon his personal experiences as part of a leftist movement in South Africa during its apartheid regime, as he believed the policies and philosophy of the apartheid regime resembled that of the village. The idea of a sheriff refusing to bear arms was directly inspired by an incident that occurred while Rakoff was in South Africa, when during a night out he had the intention of shooting a man he considered to be a racist but was stopped by another group member. Rakoff explained \"Later, I was warned. If I'd wanted to go from associate to full member of the group, I'd have to be more disciplined and give up the gun. It was irresponsible in that world, at that time\". In addition to his personal experiences Rakoff was influenced by cowboy Marvel Comics, the title of the episode, as well as its opening sequence were lifted from Gene Autry comic books."]}, {"page": "Jolly phonics", "response": ["#REDIRECTEric Mival"]}, {"page": "Mival, Eric", "response": ["#redirectEric Mival"]}]}}
