Davies's initial idea for the programme was a part-documentary, part-drama called The Legend Begins, combining interviews with Doctor Who's creators with dramatised sequences showing how the events took place. It evolved into a proposal called Eulogy for the Doctor, featuring several actors who had appeared as the Doctor's companions, returning to their roles for a drama linking archive clips from the series. Eventually, all of these ideas were scaled down or abandoned in favour of a straightforward documentary format.
