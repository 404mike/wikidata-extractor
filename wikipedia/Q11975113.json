The orthography he eventually chose, after discussions in London, was not that of Karl Richard Lepsius (as is sometimes claimed), since it had not yet been published, but was based on a short document issued in 1848 by Henry Venn of the Church Missionary Society entitled Rules for Reducing Unwritten Languages to Alphabetical Writing in Roman Characters With Reference Specially to the Languages Spoken in Africa.Spencer (1966), pp. 88\u201395, where Venn's document is quoted in full. The aim of this was to produce a simple practical system of orthography for teaching purposes with the use of as few diacritics as possible. Koelle, however, sought a more accurate phonetic system, and added diacritics. He retained seven of the eight vowels of Venn's system (i, e, \u1eb9, a, \u1ecd, o, u, omitting \u1ea1 as in \"but\") but added length marks, a dot for nasalisation, and an accent to indicate the prominent syllable. (Unlike in Lepsius's alphabet, the dotted \u1eb9 and \u1ecd are open not closed sounds.) He modified Venn's alphabet by writing d\u1e63 for the sound of \"judge\" or \"church\" (apparently confusing these two), and n followed by a dot (n\u02d9) for the \"ng\" sound of \"sing\".
