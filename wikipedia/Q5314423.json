A Cage of Ice, for example, involves a London physician who accompanies a hand-picked team of adventurers on a snowmobile journey across the Arctic to rescue a defecting Soviet scientist.  Green River High follows another group of adventurers into the jungles of Borneo in search of a plane that crashed there during World War II. Kyle's novels are, like those of Bagley and Alistair MacLean, stronger on plot and setting than on characterization.  They are invariably well-crafted, however, and two\u2014The King's Commissar and The Dancing Men\u2014are classics of the historical fiction and historical detective story genres, respectively.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kim Philby", "response": ["* Under the cover name of 'Mowgli' Philby appears in Duncan Kyle's World War II thriller Black Camelot published in 1978."]}, {"page": "Basil Zaharoff", "response": ["* Zaharoff is a character in the novel The King's Commisar by Duncan Kyle."]}, {"page": "Wewelsburg", "response": ["* The attempted destruction of the castle in 1945 forms the d\u00e9nouement of Duncan Kyle's 1978 novel Black Camelot."]}, {"page": "Masud Rana", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" |Based on A Cage of Ice by Duncan Kyle.
