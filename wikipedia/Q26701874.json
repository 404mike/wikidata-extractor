Ferguson had held the seat since 1830 and had received significant support from the Catholic segment of the constituency.  The Liberal Party's candidate Samuel MacCurdy Greer had counted on this support transferring to him, however the Irish Conservative Party's candidate William McCormick, who employed a significant number of Catholic workers, managed to split the Catholic vote.  The Liberal Party's Presbyterian support had also been adversely affected by their defeat to the Tories in Londonderry County in 1857, which led many to withdraw from politics.", "The Irish Conservative Party's candidate was William McCormick, a Donegal-born engineering contractor.  He arrived in Londonderry in 1840 as an entrepreneur during a land reclamation project on Lough Swilly.  McCormick was popular as he had intervened to save local railway lines running to Coleraine and Enniskillen and employed hundreds of local people.  There were two Liberal Party candidates Samuel MacCurdy Greer and George Skipton.  Greer was born in County Londonderry and represented the county constituency as a Radical between the 1857 and 1859 general elections.  Skipton was a resident of Beech Hill in Londonderry.  All of the candidates were prominent in the municipal life of Londonderry."]}]}}
