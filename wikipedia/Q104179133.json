In January 1915 he scored four goals for Airdrie in a 5\u20130 league victory over Rangers, albeit this was during World War I when the SFL continued but wartime commitments and restrictions often affected the matches. Donaldson played regularly in the top division of Scottish football for 14 seasons, but never won a major trophy nor took part in a final \u2013 however, Airdrie won the Lanarkshire Cup six times while he was with the club, and he is known to have been involved in the 1914 victory but likely to have played in most if not all of the other finals.", "link_mentions": {}}}
