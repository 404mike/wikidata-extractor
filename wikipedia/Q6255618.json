Rose was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm slow and who occasionally fielded as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Warwick, Warwickshire.\nRose made a single first-class appearance for Surrey against Yorkshire in 1878. Yorkshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 309 all out, with Rose taking a single wicket in the innings, that of Allen Hill. In response, Surrey were dismissed in their first-innings for just 78, with Rose dismissed for a duck by George Ulyett. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, Surrey were dismissed for 127, with Rose again dismissed for a duck, this time by Harry Pearson. Yorkshire won the match by an innings and 104 runs. This was his only major appearance for the county.\nHe died at Tiddington, Warwickshire, on 6 November 1920.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rose", "response": ["John Rose may refer to:", "*John Rose (fl. 1399), MP for Totnes", "*John Rose (died 1591), English MP for Canterbury", "*Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet (1820\u20131888), Canadian politician", "*John Rose (Minnesota politician) (1934\u20131988), American state representative and former teacher", "*John Rose (Tennessee politician) (born 1965), U.S. Representative for Tennessee's 6th congressional district, Former Commissioner of Agriculture for the State of Tennessee ", "* John Rose (potter), 18th-century founder of Coalport porcelain", "* John Rose (author, advertising executive), founder of Rose Marketing Ltd.
