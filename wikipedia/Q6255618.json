Rose was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm slow and who occasionally fielded as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Warwick, Warwickshire.\nRose made a single first-class appearance for Surrey against Yorkshire in 1878. Yorkshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 309 all out, with Rose taking a single wicket in the innings, that of Allen Hill. In response, Surrey were dismissed in their first-innings for just 78, with Rose dismissed for a duck by George Ulyett. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, Surrey were dismissed for 127, with Rose again dismissed for a duck, this time by Harry Pearson. Yorkshire won the match by an innings and 104 runs. This was his only major appearance for the county.\nHe died at Tiddington, Warwickshire, on 6 November 1920.", "link_mentions": {}}}
