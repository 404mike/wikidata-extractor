Two years later, Cynthia Lennon, feeling miserable and increasingly distanced from her husband, decided to go on holiday to Greece with her friends Jenny Boyd and Magic Alex. Whilst on his own, Lennon called Ono and invited her over for the night. The genesis of the album came about when Yoko expressed an interest in John's avant-garde home recordings after he had asked \"Do you want to hear some of the things I've been playing around at in my studio?\" Lennon then played her some of his tapes which consisted of comedy recordings and electronic sounds, both of which he knew the other Beatles would not allow on their albums. After hearing the tapes, Ono insisted that they make their own recording. Cynthia returned home unexpectedly the next day to find them sitting cross-legged on the floor in matching white robes, staring into each other's eyes. The \"Unfinished Music\" series was an attempt by the pair to keep a record of their life together. With Ono's Grapefruit in mind, they had imagined that the sound was not etched into the vinyl's grooves but was meant to be created by the listener's mind. Lennon described \"Unfinished Music\" as \"saying whatever you want it to say. It is just us expressing ourselves like a child does, you know, however he feels like then.

By the end of 1970 his excessive drinking was causing concern. By 1972 he was drinking heavily and showing signs of alcoholism, and he had experimented with LSD and mescaline. Celmins quoted Fleetwood's first wife, Jenny Boyd, who knew Kirwan, as saying, \"I think drugs and alcohol got Danny totally nuts in the end.

Jenny Boyd also meditated for long periods, but suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation left many students moody and oversensitive. Several people on the course and the Maharishi were particularly concerned about Prudence Farrow's unwillingness to stop meditating. ", "In Pattie Boyd's account, it was the allegations of the Maharishi's sexual impropriety that caused life at the retreat to go \"horribly wrong\". Through Mardas' insistence, Lennon became convinced that the Maharishi, who said he was celibate, had had a sexual encounter with one of the young female students. As reported by Brown, the woman was a \"pretty blond nurse from California\" who, Mardas said, had engaged in a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. Dolan recalls that she was in fact a \"feisty\" schoolteacher from New York, named Rosalyn Bonas (or \"RB\"), who was having an affair with Mardas. She had become disillusioned at the extent to which Hindu tradition and the Vedas were part of the course, and was prevented from leaving early for the US due to the conditions of her airline ticket. Jenny Boyd wrote that she had seen Mardas and the woman deep in conversation, \"obviously cooking something up\".", "On the Beatles' final night at the ashram, Mardas arranged to entrap the Maharishi by spying on him and the woman when they were alone together. Mardas then reported to the others that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. Many of the people at the ashram \u2013 including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Dolan, Cynthia Lennon and Jenny Boyd \u2013 did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia, however, Mardas' allegations  \"gathered momentum ... without a single shred of evidence or justification\". In her autobiography, Pattie Boyd also expresses doubt regarding the truth behind Mardas' claims, but in this atmosphere of suspicion, she had a \"horrid dream about Maharishi\" and, the next day, told Harrison that they should leave. According to Harrison, Lennon \"had wanted to leave anyway\", to see Ono, and the speculation surrounding Farrow and other female students \"stirred up a situation\" that Lennon was able to exploit.", "While waiting for their taxis, Lennon wrote \"Maharishi\" (later retitled \"Sexy Sadie\"), in which he sang: \"Maharishi \u2013 what have you done? / You made a fool of everyone.\" In a 1974 interview, Lennon said that they were convinced that the delay in the taxis' arrival was orchestrated by locals loyal to the Maharishi, and this paranoia was exacerbated by the presence of \"the mad Greek\". According to Cynthia Lennon, when the group finally left the ashram, the Maharishi looked \"very biblical and isolated in his faith\". Jenny Boyd later wrote: \"Poor Maharishi. I remember him standing at the gate of the ashram, under an aide's umbrella, as the Beatles filed by, out of his life. 'Wait,' he cried. 'Talk to me.'
