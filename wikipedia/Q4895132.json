His younger brother Tom also played rugby, though he played for rival club Neath and had a more successful international career, representing Wales six times.\nHollingdale made his Welsh international debut on 14 December 1912 against the touring South African team. He would face the South Africans twelve days later as part of the Swansea team that achieved a tight victory over the tourists. His second and final cap was during the 1913 Five Nations Championship when he was selected to face England. The Welsh team lost badly and Hollingdale was one of eight players from the side that would not represent Wales again.\nInternational matches played Wales\n England 1913\n South Africa 1912", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1912\u201313 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe", "response": [";Wales: Bobbie Williams (Cardiff), Billy Geen (Newport), Fred Birt (Newport), Billy Spiller (Cardiff), Reg Plummer (Newport), Horace Thomas (Swansea), Tommy Vile (Newport) (capt.), F Andrews (Pontypool), Rees Thomas (Pontypool), F Perrett (Neath), Glyn Stephens (Neath), Percy Jones (Newport), Harry Wetter (Newport), Bert Hollingdale (Swansea), Johnnie Morgan (Llanelli)"]}, {"page": "Hollingdale", "response": ["* Bert Hollingdale (1889\u20131961), Welsh international rugby union player"]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union families", "response": ["*Bert Hollingdale and Thomas Hollingdale; brothers"]}]}}
