His major achievements over close to five decades as a manager include winning the Scottish Cup in 1987 with St Mirren and 1990 with Aberdeen, where he also won the Scottish League Cup in 1989. He had a role in the development of many prominent players, and the 2005 book on Scottish football, The Final Whistle? was described as \"the nearest thing the Scottish game has to a father figure\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberdeen F.C.", "response": ["Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott. A number of foreign players were signed, including Dutch internationals Theo Snelders and Hans Gillhaus. In the 1989\u201390 season, the club won both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994\u201395 season second-bottom, and had to rely on a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt for the first time in its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, hiring him as the club's chairman."]}, {"page": "Willie Miller", "response": ["In February 1992, he was appointed Aberdeen manager, replacing the sacked Alex Smith.'Fan power was on the rampage': How Alex Smith paid the price for Aberdeen\u2019s troubled 1991-92 season, Neil Drysdale, Press & Journal, 11 October 2021 Despite two second-place finishes in the league and two losing cup finals in 1992\u201393, Miller was sacked in February 1995 with the club in danger of being relegated for the first time in its history (survival was eventually achieved via a playoff)."]}, {"page": "Stirling Albion F.C.", "response": ["On retiring to the boardroom, Shankly was succeeded for one season by Frank Beattie but then handpicked his long-term protege, former Albion player Alex Smith, who had been cutting his managerial teeth at Stenhousemuir. Smith's first season in 1974\u201375 saw the club finish 8th, three points behind Alex Ferguson\u2019s St Mirren in 6th. That slim margin would prove crucial as league reconstruction meant it was the difference between staying in the 2nd division or starting afresh in the new 3rd tier."]}, {"page": "Maurice Malpas", "response": ["After retiring as a player, Malpas assumed full-time coaching duties at Tannadice, having been acting as player/coach since 1991.
