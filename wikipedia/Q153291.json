Plowright received the 1999 World Food Prize for his development of tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV), the key element in the quest to eliminate rinderpest. Rinderpest became the first animal disease to be eliminated worldwide.\nHe was the second son of Jonathan and Mahala Plowright. He attended Moulton Grammar School  which transferred to Spalding Grammar School in 1939. He graduated from the Royal Veterinary College in London in 1944 and was commissioned into the Royal Army Veterinary Corps.As a young veterinary pathologist, Plowright  carried out research in Kenya and Nigeria. The East African Veterinary Research Organization at Muguga in Kenya provided the base for Plowright and his colleagues to adopt the cell-culture techniques used to develop the polio vaccine to produce a live attenuated (non-pathogenic) virus for use as a rinderpest vaccine.\t \nPlowright used a mono-layer of kidney cells to culture the virus until it became non-virulent and could be transmitted from one cattle to another, producing lifelong immunity against rinderpest. Unlike its predecessors, tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV) could be used safely in all types of cattle, it could be produced very economically and conferred lifelong immunity.\nThe research and application techniques that brought Plowright success in fighting rinderpest were later replicated by his colleagues to vaccinate against sheeppox and lumpy skin disease.\nIn 1964, Plowright returned to the United Kingdom to oversee animal disease research there until his 1983 retirement. He chaired the Royal Veterinary College\u2019s microbiology and parasitology department from 1971 to 1978. He was Head of Microbiology at the Institute for Animal Health in Compton, Berkshire from 1978 to 1983. In addition to rinderpest, Plowright also contributed to the study of such viral animal diseases as African swine fever, malignant catarrhal fever, poxviruses, and herpesviruses.\nHe was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Society of London and received the Order of St Michael and St George. He also received the World Organisation for Animal Health's Gold Medal and the Animal Health Trust\u2019s Outstanding Scientific Achievement Award. He was awarded the King Baudouin International Development Prize 1984-1985 by the Belgian monarch.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rinderpest", "response": ["Walter Plowright worked on a vaccine for the RBOK strain of the rinderpest virus for about a decade, from 1956 to 1962.

Although the causes of death vary from year to year, in one drought in Botswana, young calves and aged females were the most likely to die.

The genus Herpesvirus was established in 1971 in the first report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). This genus  consisted of 23 viruses and 4 groups of viruses. In the second ICTV report in 1976 this genus was elevated to family level - the Herpetoviridae. Because of possible confusion with viruses derived from reptiles this name was changed in the third report in 1979 to Herpesviridae. In this report the family Herpesviridae was divided into 3 subfamilies (Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae) and 5 unnamed genera: 21 viruses were listed. In 2009 the family Herpesviridae was elevated to the order Herpesvirales. This elevation was necessitated by the discovery that the herpesviruses of fish and molluscs were only distantly related to those of birds and mammals. Two new families were created - the family Alloherpesviridae which incorporates bony fish and frog viruses and the family Malacoherpesviridae which contains those of molluscs."]}, {"page": "2010 in science", "response": ["*19 February \u2013 Walter Plowright (b. 1923), veterinary scientist, developed rinderpest vaccine."]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Walter Plowright, veterinary scientist (b. 1923)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2010", "response": ["*Walter Plowright, 86, British veterinary scientist."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R", "response": ["| Walter Plowright||19 March 1981||23 July 1923 \u2013 19 February 2010 Microbiologist"]}, {"page": "King Baudouin International Development Prize", "response": ["*1984-85 - Dr. Walter Plowright - UK "]}, {"page": "Plowright", "response": ["*Walter Plowright (1923-2010), English veterinary scientist"]}, {"page": "1974 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Walter Plowright, Professor of Veterinary Microbiology and Parasitology, Royal Veterinary College, University of London."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1981", "response": ["*Walter Plowright  (1923\u20132010)"]}]}}
