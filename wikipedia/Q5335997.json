London returned to the professional ranks in 1990 after purchasing from London Marconi's their NSL franchise rights. After the demise of the Canadian Soccer League two of their teams Winnipeg Fury, and North York Rockets joined the NSL which resulted in the renaming of the league to the Canadian National Soccer League. Their return marked a new philosophical approach in the club's direction by providing an opportunity for young local players to make the transition to the professional level. During their second stint in the league London received several individual team awards as the Most Disciplined Team and John Bottineau receiving the CNSL Rookie of the Year in 1995. In 1997, London secured their first postseason berth since their return to the CNSL. Their opponents in the first round were Kosova Albanians with goals coming from Pete Paterson, John Williams, and Howard Buchanan to give London a 3\u20130 victory in the first series. In the second series Kosova won the match 2\u20131, and advanced to the next round after scoring an overtime goal. Prominent players during the club's CNSL days were Canadian international Frank Sauer, Gert D\u00f6rfel, Jurek Gebczynski, Eddie Edgar, Kenrick Emanuel, Nick Bontis, Euclid Bertrand, Anthony Dominique, and Andrew Loague.", "After a successful surgery Harry returned to the fold in 2008, but only in the capacity of director-at-large with former player Eddie Edgar appointed as head coach. After a series of poor performances Edgar was released from his position with Sean Gauss replacing him on an interim basis. Though Sean managed to record two draws the season was still a disaster as London finished the season without a single win becoming the first team to go win less since North York Talons in the 1997 CNSL season.
