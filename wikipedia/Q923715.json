He was capped four times by England and was part of the Euro 96 squad.Following the end of his playing days, Howey had a brief spell in charge of non-league side Crook Town before coming out of retirement to play for Bishop Auckland whilst serving as a coach. He has since worked as a sports radio presenter for Total Sport and BBC Radio Newcastle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["When Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities. The training ground was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with his own money, with the cleaning work being done in one weekend. Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high. Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at. In five-a-sides he and Terry McDermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players. Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: Lee Clark, Steve Watson, Steve Howey, Alan Thompson and Robbie Elliott. These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997. Keegan noted Steve Watson would take throw-ins via a somersault throw and this amused and shocked Keegan. Keegan regarded it as a gimmick and he could not believe the fans would take joy in it. The throw-in, to Keegan, was a sign of how far Newcastle had fallen. Keegan wanted the club to be known for scoring goals and thrilling football. Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark. Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off. Prior to the game Keegan arranged a training match for the reserves and included himself to make up the numbers. In the training match a frustrated Clark went through the back of Keegan in a knee high tackle, following a hospital pass, in a similar way that Romeo Benetti went into the back of Keegan in an England versus Italy match. The melee resulted in Pavel Srnicek swinging a roundhouse kick at Lee Clark's head. Keegan was not upset and he did not punish either player. To Keegan, Srnicek and Clark's response showed they cared about their football. Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3\u20130 victory in front of a capacity crowd."]}, {"page": "2004 MLS Expansion Draft", "response": ["|Steve Howey (D)||Jay Heaps (D)||Andy Dorman (M)"]}, {"page": "Barry Venison", "response": ["Venison made his debut of the Magpies on 15 August 1992 in the 3\u20132 league win over Southend United at St James' Park, Venison enjoyed a tremendous beginning to his Newcastle career as they won their first eleven league games in a row, leaving them runaway leaders of Division One and looking uncatchable in the promotion race by October. The run came to an end when they lost to a last minute goal at home against Grimsby Town; they fell just 2 games short of the record 13 straight victories that had been set seven years earlier by Reading in the old Third Division. Keegan got his team to play in an exciting, attacking way with them becoming a talking point within the game for their exuberant style of play along with their mean defence which included a revitalised Venison as well as the likes of John Beresford and Steve Howey. Newcastle went on to become Division One champions, winning the title with a 2\u20130 away win, coincidentally at Grimsby, thus gaining promotion to the Premier League."]}, {"page": "Aaron Hughes", "response": ["Born in Cookstown, County Tyrone, Hughes came through the ranks at Newcastle United.

His league debut came against Sheffield Wednesday on 10 January 1998, playing the entirety of a 2\u20131 defeat at Hillsborough. Although he featured in the earlier rounds, including the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in the latter campaign as a 36th-minute replacement for the injured Steve Howey, Hughes was not included in Newcastle's squads for their FA Cup Final defeats in 1998 and 1999."]}, {"page": "List of foreign MLS players", "response": ["*Steve Howey \u2013 New England \u2013 2004"]}, {"page": "Richard Dunne", "response": ["It was in the centre of defence where Dunne made his biggest impact on the team. Dunne had various partners in the centre of defence in his first season at the club and for a few games he played in a three-man defence with Andy Morrison and Steve Howey. His first season saw City relegated into the First Division and acquire the services of a new manager, Kevin Keegan. Manchester City made an instant return to the Premier League, finishing the 2001\u201302 season as First Division champions. Disciplinary problems in 2003 resulted in a club suspension, and his time at Manchester City looked to be over. However, Dunne returned to the first team following an intensive fitness programme, and within a few months gained an international recall."]}, {"page": "Robbie Elliott", "response": ["Elliott began his career with his hometown club in 1989 as a youth trainee and offered a professional contract just two years later. He was one of a number of youngsters who had been blooded by the Magpies for first team action by Ossie Ardiles in 1991\u201392, others included Steve Watson, Steve Howey, Alan Thompson and Lee Clark.

However, they missed out on automatic promotion by one place, before enduring a humiliating play-off exit at the hands of local rivals Sunderland. The intensifying boardroom battle soon took its toll on the club, and Smith resigned early in the following season with the side stuck in mid-table. Ossie Ardiles became the club's new manager, and despite being initially being the club's most popular manager since Joe Harvey, Newcastle dropped to the bottom of the Second Division in October 1991. Results failed to improve, despite the acquisition of a new striker in David Kelly and the efforts of promising young players including Steve Howey, Steve Watson and Gavin Peacock, and in February 1992 Ardiles was sacked. Despite being the best-supported side in the division and frequently still managing to pull in crowds of more than 20,000, Newcastle were also millions of pounds in debt and faced with the real prospect of third tier football for the first time ever. A saviour was needed, and in came new chairman John Hall, who offered the manager's job to Kevin Keegan. Despite having vowed never to enter management following his retirement as a player, Keegan accepted the offer to manage Newcastle.

Morrison returned to the City team in a League Cup game against Ipswich in December 2000. However, due to the number of yellow cards he had picked up in reserve-team games he could not play Premier League football until New Year's Day 2001, when he played in a 1\u20131 draw with Coventry City. In his next outing, an FA Cup game against Birmingham City, he scored with a bullet header in a 3\u20132 victory (Darren Huckerby and Shaun Goater scored the other goals for City). Morrison made two further appearances for City in the league: a 4\u20130 defeat to Leeds United and a 1\u20131 draw with Liverpool. In the latter, Morrison was replaced, by Andrei Kanchelskis (on loan from Rangers), at half time, due to a hamstring injury. Morrison was forced to withdraw from the squad, which drew 1\u20131 with Middlesbrough in early February, due to the same hamstring injury (he was replaced, in the squad, by Shaun Wright-Phillips). Morrison played in City's 1\u20130 victory against Coventry City in the fourth round of the FA Cup (in which Goater scored the only goal). Morrison also played in the fifth round of the FA Cup, against eventual winners Liverpool (which ended in a 4\u20132 defeat). Morrison was spoken to by a police officer for squirting water at a Liverpool fan after he had been replaced by Tony Grant. After the game, Royle dismissed speculation that Morrison had played his last game for the club. However, the defeat did prove to be Morrison's last appearance for City, as Royle became concerned about his injury record. Morrison was subsequently loaned out to Sheffield United, who were then managed by Neil Warnock. Morrison played alongside another former Manchester City captain, Keith Curle, in defence at Sheffield United. The wisdom of allowing Morrison to be loaned out was questioned when Howey suffered an injury whilst playing for City. Morrison made his debut for Sheffield United in a 4\u20131 defeat to Gillingham. He came on as a substitute, replacing Gus Uhlenbeek, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon in United's next game, in which he almost scored a late equaliser."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Steve Howey ||  || 2000\u20132003 || Defender || 94 || 11 || 9 || 0 ||  ||  || align=\"right\" | 103 ||  align=\"right\" | 11 || ||"]}, {"page": "Steve Howey", "response": ["Steve Howey may refer to:", "*Steve Howey (actor) (born 1977), American actor", "*Steve Howey (footballer) (born 1971), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Spencer Prior", "response": ["In his first season at Leicester, Prior got a League Cup winner's medal as the Foxes beat Middlesbrough in a replayed final.
