Prominent designers and dressmakers associated with the movement include Ada Nettleship, who designed costumes for Oscar Wilde's wife Constance Lloyd, and Alice Comyns Carr, who was head costume designer for the actress Ellen Terry. Anna Muthesius was a German designer living in London who was annoyed that women were being exploited by clothing industrialists and that to avoid their pronouncements they should decide on their own fabrics and designs. Her 1903 book, Das Eigenkleid der Frau, which incorporated an Art Nouveau binding by Frances MacDonald, is considered an important contribution to the Artistic Dress movement."]}, {"page": "Arthur Comyns Carr", "response": ["Comyns Carr was the son of J.

Designed by Alice Comyns Carr and crocheted by Nettleship to simulate a soft chain mail, the dress was oversewn with more than 1000 beetle wings to create an iridescent effect. The idea for this costume probably came from two earlier Nettleship designs: an 1886 dress and an 1887 hat for Constance Lloyd that were oversewn with iridescent green beetle wings. The American artist John Singer Sargent painted Terry in the Carr-Nettleship dress in 1889. The restored costume is on display in Terry's home, Smallhythe Place, near Tenterden in Kent."]}, {"page": "Patience Harris", "response": ["Harris oversaw the actor Ellen Terry's costumes during the first decade of Terry's career at the Lyceum Theatre, from the late 1870s to the late 1880s During this period, Harris designed elaborate, heavy costumes in luxurious fabrics for Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, and Much Ado About Nothing, among other plays. In 1882, Terry brought the costume designer Alice Comyns Carr on board as a consultant. Harris and Carr worked together until 1887, but their tastes differed, with Carr favoring simpler, more flowing designs in the Aesthetic dress style. Their disagreements reached a head in 1887 over designs for the plays Henry VIII and The Amber Heart, and Harris resigned. Carr succeeded her as Terry's head costumer designer."]}]}}
