At Thesiger's trial, counsel Charles Rann Kennedy described Cresswell's behaviour as being of a \"highly criminal nature\" amounting to a \"fraud\" and a \"misdemeanour\".

Blackstone, for example, argued that law could only be taught as part of a wider liberal education, including moral and political philosophy, history, logic and reasoning, experimental philosophy and classics.William Blackstone, \u2018Introduction,\u2019 Commentaries on the Laws of England (Clarendon Press, 1765-1769) 18. Similarly, Charles Rann Kennedy, the creator of the law course in Queen's College Birmingham in 1849, argued that law ought to be taught as part of a 'classical education.' Conversely, the American jurist Christopher Langdell developed a model of legal education, the case method, which focused exclusively on the kind of legal reasoning an advocate would use in court. A correlative of the case method's focus was that it is almost entirely focused on technical, doctrinal law, excluding social context, moral philosophy, and wider contextual analysis. This led him to clash with Roscoe Pound, a leading developer of sociological jurisprudence, who wanted to include social reality and jurisprudence as part of law. Despite Roscoe's opposition, the case method has proven very influential in England and the study of black-letter law now constitutes a large part of the undergraduate's study. Twining is critical of this development and argues it has had transferred to student culture, with students rejecting subjects closer to the liberal arts when they were offered in the 1990s."]}]}}
