Their music is known for its brand of \"minimalistic psychedelia\".", "The creative and song-writing force throughout Spacemen 3's history were Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. They met at the (now defunct) Rugby Art College on Clifton Road,  Rugby, Warwickshire in autumn 1982, both aged 16, and became close friends.  Pierce was in a band called Indian Scalp, but he left them near the end of 1982 in order to collaborate with Kember. The two guitarists recruited drummer Tim Morris, who played with a couple of other bands and had a rehearsal space at his parental home which they used. Shortly afterwards they were joined by an acquaintance, Pete Bain, on bass. Morris and Bain had previously played together in a band called Noise on Independent Street. Pierce handled lead vocal duties. Now a 4-piece, the band originally adopted the name The Spacemen. Their first live performances occurred around winter 1982/83, playing at a party and then at a couple of gigs they managed to get at a local bar; at the latter their set included a 20-minute version of the one-chord song \"O.D. Catastrophe\".Forced Exposure, Issue 14, Autumn 1988Outer Limits, Spacemen 3 fan magazine, Issues 1 & 2, 1991.

Around this time they started to co-host a weekly club night together with another local band, Gavin Wissen's 'The Cogs of Tyme'. 'The Reverberation Club', as it was called, was held at The Blitz public house in Rugby on Thursdays. \"50s, 60s and 70s punk\" records were played and it soon provided a live venue for Spacemen 3 and various other local bands. alteredzones.com, 2011 \u2013 interview with Peter Kember At one of their gigs at The Black Lion in 1985, they came to the attention of Pat Fish, the leader of the recording band The Jazz Butcher; he felt Spacemen 3 were \"extraordinary\" and \"like nothing else\".", "To follow up their album, Spacemen 3 made their first single: \"Walkin' with Jesus\". This was recorded at Carlo Marocco's studio outside Northampton. For the title track they re-mixed the version they had previously recorded for their demo tape. For the B-side, they recorded \"Feel So Good\", a newer composition, and re-recorded a 17-minute \"Rollercoaster\" (a cover of the 13th Floor Elevators). This single was the first Spacemen 3 record that Peter Kember and Jason Pierce produced; the duo handled all future production. The \"Walkin' with Jesus\" single was released in November 1986. It received decent reviews from NME and Sounds, and peaked at no. 29 on the UK Independent Chart, and no.\u00a046 in the indie chart published by Sounds.", "It was in 1986 that guitarist Peter Kember started to use his long-term alias 'Sonic Boom'. He had earlier employed the aliases 'Mainliner' and 'Peter Gunn'. Bassist Pete Bain also adopted his alias: 'Bassman' or 'Pete Bassman'.", "Whilst working on the album, \"Transparent Radiation\" \u2014 a cover of a song by the Red Crayola \u2014 was recorded, and released as a single in July 1987. \"Transparent Radiation\" was awarded 'Single of the Week' by Sounds, and matched the previous single in reaching no. 29 on the independent chart.Sounds, Autumn 1987 The B-side included \"Ecstasy Symphony\", a new experimental piece using an organ drone multi-tracked and fed through various effects (this would presage some of Peter Kember's later work and his interest in analogue synthesisers).", "Relations between Peter Kember and Jason Pierce were beginning to suffer as a result of Pierce's romantic relationship with Kate Radley, whom he had been dating since summer 1987. Kember resented the amount of time his song-writing partner was spending with her at his expense.", "Peter Kember had purchased an unusual electric guitar near the end of 1987: a Vox Starstream made in the late 1960s. This guitar incorporated several in-built effects, including fuzz and Repeat Percussion (or Repeater). The latter was a unique tremolo type, almost delay-like effect, and Kember would use it heavily on Spacemen 3's future output. One of his first compositions featuring this effect was the eponymous \"Repeater\" (a.k.a. \"How Does It Feel?\"). \"Repeater\" and two other new songs also composed by Kember \u2013 \"Revolution\" and \"Suicide\" \u2013 were debuted on the European tour in early 1988. All three songs would feature on the next studio album, Playing with Fire. Around spring 1988 Kember was using his 4-track recorder to develop his ideas and several songs for the next album.", "Recording for Playing with Fire recommenced; they returned to VHF Studios, outside Rugby, where they had recorded The Perfect Prescription. By now, song-writing duo Peter Kember and Jason Pierce were formulating new song ideas entirely separate from one another. Both their personal and working relationships were beginning to disintegrate. Pierce's romance with Kate Radley was impacting on his time with the band and his contributions. Of the eventual tracks on Playing with Fire, six were Kember's compositions, whilst only three were Pierce's. The  recording process for this album was different: individual parts were recorded separately, which meant band members did not have to be present at the same time.", "Spacemen 3 \"became the indie phenomenon of late 1988\" (Erik Morse). They were receiving more media attention and got their first cover story in Melody Maker 19 November 1988 issue.Melody Maker, 19/11/1988 Peter Kember effectively became the sole spokesperson for Spacemen 3, giving numerous interviews. These provided for controversy and journalistic focus due to Kember's candid openness about his drug-taking habits and his forthright views on recreational drug use. On one occasion, Kember invited his interviewer to accompany him as he collected his methadone prescription. Kember was regularly described in the music papers, incorrectly, as the \"leader\" of Spacemen 3, although he had not helped in this portrayal: in the Melody Maker article referred to above, Kember had stated: \"This band is my design and the rest are totally into it.\"NME, 29/7/1989NME, Summer 1988Sounds, 05/12/1988Lime Lizard, April 1989OffBEAT, 07/03/1989Sounds, 11/3/1989", "Completion of the Playing with Fire album was delayed due to recording delays and a dispute about song-writing credits. At a meeting at Fire Records' London office, Peter Kember proffered his name for single writing credits for six of the album's nine songs; however, Jason Pierce countered, demanding joint credits for three of those songs due to the guitar parts he had contributed to them. An argument led to Kember attempting to hit Pierce and a scuffle ensued. An impasse resulted; Pierce threatened to pull his songs from the album if his demands were not met. Manager Gerald Palmer mediated to resolve the feud. At a very tense four-hour meeting, of fierce arguments and recriminations between Kember and Pierce, Palmer finally managed to obtain a compromise with Kember conceding split song-writing credits for 'Suicide'.", "In late 1988, Peter Kember was already working on new material for post Playing with Fire. His productivity meant he had a surfeit of songs, and he advised his bandmates of his intention to produce a solo album. New indie label Silvertone Records offered Kember a generous one-off album deal which he accepted. Kember finished recordings for his debut solo album and single in March 1989, prior to the commencement of Spacemen 3's European tour. Other members of Spacemen 3, including Pierce, as well as other musicians, had contributed sessions. Release of Kember's solo album (Spectrum) and single \u2013 under the moniker of Kember's alias, Sonic Boom \u2013 were put on hold in order to avoid a marketing clash with Playing with Fire.", "At the beginning of 1989 Spacemen 3 had been one of the \"hottest indie bands in England\" (Erik Morse) and were gaining the attention of major US record labels. However, despite their success in winter 1988\u201389, their prospects were very different less than a year later. The personal and working relationship between Peter Kember and Jason Pierce, still the principal members of the band, would completely disintegrate, leading Spacemen 3 to eventually disband.", "In late 1989, Jason Pierce, dissatisfied with his mixes at VHF Studios, took his recordings for the Recurring album to Battery Studios, London. Assisted by engineer/producer Anjali Dutt, Pierce completed final remixes of his songs in January 1990. However, Peter Kember's side of the album was far from ready, and he resorted to calling on the help of Richard Formby, a producer. According to Formby, when he arrived, Kember's recording was only half done; some songs were incomplete, and two had to be re-recorded from scratch.", "In January 1990, Kember's side project and debut solo album, Spectrum (Sonic Boom), was released. Recorded nearly a year previously, Kember had used the project as a vehicle for a group of melancholic themed songs, having decided to save his more upbeat work for Spacemen 3 and Recurring.Peter Kember \u2013 TV interview, 1991 The Spectrum album was advertised as being by the \"founder member/leader of Spacemen 3\".", "Most members of Spacemen 3 have continued to produce music and record either collaboratively or in solo projects. Peter Kember (alias 'Sonic Boom') has had a solo career releasing music under the monikers Spectrum and E.A.R., and has also done production work for MGMT, Panda Bear, Dean & Britta and The Flowers of Hell. Jason Pierce (alias 'J. Spaceman') remains the leader and creative force, and only constant member, of the alternative band Spiritualized who have achieved significant critical acclaim and commercial success. Both Kember and Pierce continue to perform some Spacemen 3 songs live (e.g. \"Transparent Radiation\", \"Revolution\", \"Suicide\", \"Set Me Free\", \"Che\" and \"Let Me Down Gently\" [Kember]; and \"Take Me to the Other Side\", \"Walkin' with Jesus\", \"Amen\" and \"Lord Can You Hear Me?\" [Pierce]).", "A partial and unofficial 'reunion' of Spacemen 3 occurred on 15 July 2010 at a benefit gig dubbed 'A Reunion of Friends', organised for former Spacemen 3 drummer Natty Brooker (diagnosed with terminal cancer) at the Hoxton Bar and Grill in London where there was a retrospective  exhibition of his artwork.
