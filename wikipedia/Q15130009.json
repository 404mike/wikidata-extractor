He worked closely with David Breeze (chief inspector of ancient monuments for historic Scotland and visiting professor at Durham University since 1994) on their joint studies in aspects of Hadrian's Wall and produced one of the most influential texts on the subject, still in print today.

Birley therefore organised the first Congress in 1949 by himself. Thereafter, the tradition grew that those archaeologists who had organised a Congress formed an informal committee which received proposals for the location of future meetings. This arrangement has continued to this day. At the end of each Congress a plenary session hears the proposal (sometimes proposals) for the next location and votes on the nomination. A local group, with support from the international committee, then organises the next Congress. This informality extends to the election of the international chair(s) of the Congress. For many years the Congress was co-Chaired by Professors David Breeze and Siegmar von Schnurbein, with von Schnurbein stepping down when he retired (2006) and Breeze continuing in the role. David Breeze stepped down in Ingolstadt in 2015 and Dr Rebecca Jones and Dr Andreas Thiel were then elected by the whole Congress at the closing plenary session.
