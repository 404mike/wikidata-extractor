He began riding BMX at the age of 15 and mountain biking a year later.From 2007 till 2011, Atherton was one third of the Animal Commen\u00e7al racing team, alongside brother Gee Atherton and sister Rachel Atherton.He is now part of the Trek Factory Racing team with brother Gee, sister Rachel and old friend Marc Beaumont (Global Mountain Bike Network), and is primarily racing Enduro-downhill and occasional downhill races.\nDan Atherton, along with Rachel and Gee, was the star of the web series The Atherton Project, which followed their day-to-day lives.\nIn 2010 Atherton broke a vertebra in his neck whilst dirt jumping and has missed half of the season including the World Championships.\nAfter the 2012 season's end, Atherton won the Asia Pacific Downhill Challenge in Indonesia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Downhill mountain biking", "response": ["*Dan Atherton"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Dan Atherton"]}, {"page": "UCI Mountain Bike World Cup", "response": ["|  Dan Atherton"]}, {"page": "British National Mountain Biking Championships", "response": ["| Dan Atherton"]}, {"page": "Four-cross", "response": ["*Dan Atherton"]}, {"page": "Sam Hill (cyclist)", "response": ["After placing fifth at round one in Vigo, Spain, all eyes were glued on Sam Hill in round two. The extremely steep and technical track seemed almost tailor-made for the young Australian. All seemed to be going well for Hill when he qualified in first place early on race day, besting the second place qualifier by over 14 seconds! Hill was looking confident for Finals. However, with approximately 30 riders left to set off, on arguably the most dangerous course the world cup series has seen in many years, the skies opened up. It had rained every day at this time the whole weekend, but not this hard. Riders who qualified in the top ten, were seen finishing in the late forties, early fifties. When last man to down the track, Hill, set off, no one could believe their eyes. The World Champion at the time was ripping down the track faster than top riders were riding it in the bone dry, perfect conditions. Hill's split time was faster than second place (Steve Peat, who raced in the dry), but a fall later in his run meant the Aussie ended up in a very respectable third position, just 1.63sec off first place rider Matti Lehikoinen, who also completed his final run in the dry. Hill's run will go down in history as one of the greatest runs in the wet, if not one of the greatest ever. Dan Atherton later quoted \"He showed us all that it ain't over, 'till its truly over\". Further, eventual winner Matti Lehikoinen stated after the race \"I played the tactics (referring to a 20-second pause in his practice run, ensuring a lower qualifying position to avoid any unfavourable weather changes), but Sam is the winner of the day. No questions\". Steve Peat said \"Sam is the King \u2013 give him the crown.\" Despite his remarkable and certainly unmatched talent for riding in unfavorable conditions, Sam admits that he rarely rides in the rain. In an interview with Steve Jones of Dirt Magazine featured in the film 'Earthed 5: The Law of Fives', when asked if it rained that hard in Australia and if he was used to riding in such conditions Sam replied \"I don't even see a raindrop when I'm in Australia\". Jones then asked \"So you never ride in the rain?\" Hill's reply was simply, \"My bike gets muddy\"."]}, {"page": "Gee Atherton", "response": ["From 2007 to 2011, Gee was one third of the Animal Commen\u00e7al racing team, alongside brother Dan Atherton and sister Rachel Atherton.
