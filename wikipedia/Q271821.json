Attempts were made to claim Toulouse, the rightful inheritance of Eleanor's grandmother Philippa of Toulouse, but they ended in failure. A bitter feud arose between the king and Thomas Becket, initially his chancellor and closest adviser and later the archbishop of Canterbury. Louis of France had remarried and been widowed; he married for the third time and finally fathered a long-hoped-for son, Philip Augustus, also known as Dieudonne\u2014God-given). \"Young Henry,\" son of Henry and Eleanor, wed Margaret, daughter of Louis from his second marriage. Little is known of Eleanor's involvement in these events. It is certain that by late 1166, Henry's notorious affair with Rosamund Clifford had become known, and Eleanor's marriage to Henry appears to have become terminally strained.", "Henry lost the woman reputed to be his great love, Rosamund Clifford, in 1176. He had met her in 1166 and had begun their liaison in 1173, supposedly contemplating divorce from Eleanor. This notorious affair caused a monkish scribe to transcribe Rosamund's name in Latin to \"Rosa Immundi\", or \"Rose of Unchastity\". The king had many mistresses, but although he treated earlier liaisons discreetly, he flaunted Rosamund. He may have done so to provoke Eleanor into seeking an annulment, but if so, the queen disappointed him. Nevertheless, rumours persisted, perhaps assisted by Henry's camp, that Eleanor had poisoned Rosamund. It is also speculated that Eleanor placed Rosamund in a bathtub and had an old woman cut Rosamund's arms. Henry donated much money to Godstow Nunnery in Oxfordshire, where Rosamund was buried.", "Eleanor and Rosamund Clifford, as well as Henry IIand Rosamund's father, appear in Gaetano Donizetti's opera Rosmonda d'Inghilterra (libretto by Felice Romani), which was premiered in Florence, at the Teatro Pergola, in 1834."]}, {"page": "1165", "response": ["* Henry II's marriage with Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine is effectively ended when she moves back to Aquitaine.

Legend has obscured the manor's origins. King Henry I enclosed the park to contain the deer. Henry II housed his mistress Rosamund Clifford (sometimes known as \"Fair Rosamund\") there in a \"bower and labyrinth\"; a spring in which she is said to have bathed remains, named after her. It seems the unostentatious hunting lodge was rebuilt many times, and had an uneventful history until Elizabeth I, before her succession, was imprisoned there by her half-sister Mary I between 1554 and 1555. Elizabeth had been implicated in the Wyatt plot, but her imprisonment at Woodstock was short, and the manor remained in obscurity until bombarded and ruined by Oliver Cromwell's troops during the Civil War. When the park was being re-landscaped as a setting for the Palace, the 1st Duchess wanted the historic ruins demolished, while Vanbrugh, an early conservationist, wanted them restored and made into a landscape feature.

It may have been Cotton Otho A.x, destroyed in the Ashburnham House fire of October 1731, though the catalogues by Humfrey Wanley and Franciscus Junius make no mention of this.   King Henry I may have kept a menagerie in the park. Woodstock was the scene of King Henry II's courtship of Rosamund Clifford (Fair Rosamund).

Although he is often given the surname \"Plantagenet\" in modern histories, that name was not in use during his lifetime.Given-Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards pp. 103\u2013104 The date of his birth is determined by statements of Gerald of Wales that he was barely 20 when elected bishop in 1173, and by the fact that he was about 40 when consecrated archbishop in 1191. His mother's identity is unclear. The medieval chronicler Walter Map claimed she was a whore named Ykenai, and that he was not actually Henry's son. This is the only contemporary source that gives her name, and as Map was hostile to Geoffrey, the information must be judged carefully. Instead, Ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight. Another possibility for Geoffrey's mother is Rosamund Clifford, but most of the evidence for this is circumstantial.

She wishes to confess her sins to save her soul on her deathbed, but she fears that if she confesses to an English priest, he will divulge her wrongdoings to her husband, King Henry of England. Thus, she sends to France for a priest with no loyalty to the English crown (in some versions her fear of being found out is stated directly; in others, it is implied). When King Henry hears that she has sent overseas for a priest, he suspects that his wife the queen has betrayed him in some way (again, this is stated more directly in some versions than in others). To gain information about this suspected betrayal, he hatches a plan. He suggests to his friend and associate, Earl Marshall, that they both disguise themselves as French priests and go to hear the queen's confession. Earl Marshall instantly refuses (in some versions of the ballad), saying that to \"beguile\" the queen in this way is a punishable crime for which he'll surely be hanged. (The implication is that Earl Marshall knows very well what the content of the queen's confession will be and does not want to be there with King Henry when she delivers it.) Desperate to learn what the queen has been doing behind his back, King Henry swears a royal oath (in most versions of the ballad) to Earl Marshall that regardless of what the queen might say, no official record will be made of it and no one will ever know that Earl Marshall helped deceive the queen. Earl Marshall relents, and the two men, dressed as French priests, go to hear the queen's deathbed confession. Queen Eleanor reveals several shocking sins. These vary depending on the version of the ballad, but in most versions she admits: a) she lost her virginity to Earl Marshall and not to the king; b) she has tried to poison King Henry (in some versions, she says she successfully poisoned Rosamund Clifford, the king's mistress); and c) she adores her son fathered by Earl Marshall and reviles the son she has borne to King Henry. The king by now is livid and, throwing off his disguise, he reveals himself to the horrified queen.
