He was missing throughout the 2014\u201315 pre-season as he was on compassionate leave following the death of his brother.

They are a top bunch of people, it's a top area.\" However the arrival of new signings Darren Purse and Liam Chilvers displaced McDonald from the first team picture. On 21 January, he joined Bristol Rovers on loan until the end of the season, as cover for the injured Garry Kenneth. The \"Pirates\" were then bottom of the English Football League, and manager John Ward said that McDonald was \"prepared to come down for the cause [of avoiding relegation] and that's a really big plus for me.\" However McDonald remained on the bench as the \"Gas\" lost only three of their next 15 games, and had to wait until Tom Parkes received a suspension before he finally started a game for the club on 6 April, in a 1\u20130 win at the Memorial Stadium that saw Rovers climb into 11th place.
