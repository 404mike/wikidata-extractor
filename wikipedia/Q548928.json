He led several expeditions into the interior of the continent, starting from Sydney and later from Adelaide. His expeditions traced several of the westward-flowing rivers, establishing that they all merged into the Murray River, which flows into the Southern Ocean. He was searching to prove his own passionately held belief that an \"inland sea\" was located at the centre of the continent. He reached the rank of Captain, served in several appointed posts, and on the Legislative Council.\nBorn to British parents in Bengal, British India, Sturt was educated in England for a time as a child and youth. He was placed in the British Army because his father was not wealthy enough to pay for Cambridge. After assignments in North America, Sturt was assigned to accompany a ship of convicts to Australia in 1827. Finding the place to his liking, he made his life there.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Outback", "response": ["Early European exploration of inland Australia was sporadic.
