Whilst at University in Bath, he formed the \"Dada Society\" (also known as the \"New Wave Society\") and appeared as the lead role in a dramatic adaptation of Kafka's The Trial. He also had a band called The Bath Bankers and arranged for a gig at the University featuring his friends from Sheffield - Pulp. He obtained a 2.1 honours degree in Business Administration, and went back to Sheffield to join Pulp. During the Miner's strike of 1984 he was a flying picket, taking part in industrial action including the Battle of Orgreave.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 18", "response": ["*1961 \u2013 Russell Senior, English singer-songwriter and guitarist"]}, {"page": "Pulp (band)", "response": ["Pulp were an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 1978. Their best-known line-up from their heyday (1992\u20131997) consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Senior (guitar, violin), Candida Doyle (keyboards), Nick Banks (drums, percussion), Steve Mackey (bass) and Mark Webber (guitar, keyboards).", "Pulp were formed in 1978 at The City School in Sheffield by Jarvis Cocker, then 15 years old, and Peter Dalton, then 14. Cocker's original preference was to name the band after the film Pulp starring Michael Caine, though it was decided that this was too short. Instead, the two took inspiration from a copy of the Financial Times which listed the Arabicas coffee bean in its commodity index. Cocker and Dalton used this, with a slight spelling change, and the band became \"Arabicus\".Sturdy, p. 7. Early rehearsals took place in Cocker's house and featured Cocker, Dalton and Dalton's younger brother Ian. After finally deciding on \"Arabicus Pulp\", a fixed line-up was then established: Cocker, Dalton and two friends of theirs, David Lockwood and Mark Swift.Sturdy, p. 9. The band played their first public gig at Rotherham Arts Centre in July 1980.Reed, John. \"The Complete History of Pulp\". Record Collector. December 1994. Later that year, Cocker met future member Russell Senior, who recognised Cocker from his charismatic sales techniques in his part-time job at the local fish market.Sturdy, p. 22.", "Though It failed commercially and fame was still elusive, the band continued to seek commercial success even to the point of recording a single, \"Everybody's Problem\"/\"There Was\". The single demonstrated a style shift advised by Red Rhino's Tony Perrin who had convinced Cocker that he \"could write commercial songs like Wham!\". This approach also failed and Cocker was becoming unhappy with his chosen musical direction. He was set to break up the band and go to university himself before a practice with Russell Senior (violin, guitar, vocals) and Magnus Doyle (drums) led to the establishment of a new, more experimental, artier and noisier direction for Pulp. They were subsequently augmented by Peter Mansell (bass) and Tim Allcard (keyboards, saxophone, poetry).", "It was during this period of intense fame and tabloid scrutiny that longtime member and major innovator in the band's sound Russell Senior decided to leave the band, saying, \"it wasn't creatively rewarding to be in Pulp anymore\".Barber, Lynn. \"Puppy Love\". The Observer. 5 April 1998. The band were due to begin working on a new album in late 1996. However, Cocker was having difficulty with the celebrity lifestyle, battling cocaine addiction and a break-up of a long-term relationship. When the band came to begin work on the next album, they had only one song \u2013 \"Help the Aged\". This creative inertia meant the band took over a year to finish the next record. Indeed, it was Cocker's disillusionment with his long-desired wish for fame that made up much of the subject matter of This Is Hardcore, which was released in March 1998. The album took a darker and more challenging tone than that of Different Class and lyrical topics \u2013 pornography (the title track), fame (\"Glory Days\") and the after effects of drugs (\"The Fear\") \u2013 were dealt with more earnestly than on previous records. Also in 1998, Pulp collaborated with Patrick Doyle on the song \"Like A Friend\" for the soundtrack to the film Great Expectations. The song was also used in the Adult Swim cartoon The Venture Bros. season 4 finale \"Operation: P.R.O.M.\"", "* Russell Senior \u2013 guitar, violin (1983\u20131997, 2011)", "  bar:Russell text:\"Russell Senior\""]}, {"page": "University of Bath", "response": ["*Russell Senior, formerly of the band Pulp"]}, {"page": "Freaks (Pulp album)", "response": ["Freaks was released in 1987 to little commercial success and features a much darker sound than its predecessor, It.
