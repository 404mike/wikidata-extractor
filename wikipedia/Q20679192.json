He was survived by his son Andrew Hawkins and daughter Ruth Hawkins. Lady Hawkins died in 2020 at the age of 104.After privatisation of the industry in 1991 commentators made the link to the lack of British energy policy to the days of the CEGB  \u2018Oh for the glory days of Sir Arthur Hawkins and the Central Electricity Generating Board. I never thought I'd say that about an organisation that seemed, at the time, to embody the very worst aspects of post-war corporatism and central government planning. But compared with the abject chaos into which British energy policy has descended since privatisation, the absolute rule of the CEGB seems a paragon of virtue.\u2019", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Central Electricity Generating Board", "response": ["* Sir Arthur Hawkins from 1972 to 1977, "]}, {"page": "Stanley Brown (engineer)", "response": ["Born in Birmingham and educated at the King Edward's School, Birmingham he then went on to the University of Birmingham where he graduated with a first class honours degree in electrical engineering in 1932.
