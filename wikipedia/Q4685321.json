He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler.\nAn imposing presence, measuring 6 ft 5 in and weighing around sixteen stone, Rollins made his debut for Derbyshire as an emergency wicket-keeper in the absence of teammates Bernie Maher and Karl Krikken, making him possibly the tallest wicket-keeper in first-class cricket history. Rollins became the 500th first-class cricketer for the Derbyshire team, as well as the 100th to make a first-class century, following his milestone innings with a hugely impressive innings of 200 in nine hours, the single longest innings in Derbyshire's history.\nAfter the threat of resignation from captain Dominic Cork, it was thought that Rollins was to be made the captain by the board, though this was not to come to fruition, and he was to move to Northamptonshire at the end of 1999.  Though he did not have the greatest of starts to his Northamptonshire career, he was still picking up good scores from time to time (most notably missing out on a 'double' at Lord's, where he scored 100 in the first innings and 96 in the second). After spending the 2001 season in Division One, they were to find themselves back down and out again a year later, and, in 2002, with his contract over and a wrist injury caused taking a diving catch at short leg, Northamptonshire did not offer Rollins new terms and he announced his retirement in January 2003.\nSince retiring from first-class cricket, Rollins has worked in education in Luton, Northampton, London and Derby. He is currently teaching Mathematics in Derby, where he played the majority of his cricket career.\nRollins has two brothers who have both played cricket, Gary Rollins and Robert Rollins.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian", "response": ["*Adrian Rollins (born 1972), English cricketer", "*Adrian Rollinson (born 1965), British strongman"]}, {"page": "Rollins", "response": ["* Adrian Rollins (born 1972), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 3rd || 316* ||  Adrian Rollins Kim Barnett || v Leicestershire || Leicester || 1997"]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire List A cricket records", "response": ["| 8th || 95* ||  Adrian Rollins Phillip DeFreitas || v Worcestershire || Worcester || 1998"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1993", "response": ["The season saw the debuts of Adrian Rollins, Gary Steer and Matthew Vandrau who all played in the following season.
