She was a founding member of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA) in 1876, and served as its first president. Born in England, Parker resided in Scotland. She was a delegate to the 1876 International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT) meeting which led to the formation of the BWTA. She was also instrumental in founding the World Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WWCTU). In 1881, she founded another type of women's association, one which focused on horticulture and supply, but it did not flourish. Parker described her travels in the Eastern United States in Six Happy Months amongst the Americans (1874).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1896", "response": ["* November \u2013 Margaret Eleanor Parker, English social activist; first president of the British Women's Temperance Association (b. 1827)"]}, {"page": "1827 in literature", "response": ["*probable \u2013 Margaret Eleanor Parker, English-born Scottish travel writer, social activist and social reformer (died 1896)"]}, {"page": "1827 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Margaret Eleanor Parker, social reformer (died 1896)"]}, {"page": "Margaret", "response": ["* Margaret Eleanor Parker (1827\u20131896), American social activist, social reformer, travel writer"]}, {"page": "Parker (surname)", "response": ["*Margaret Eleanor Parker (1827\u20131896), British activist, reformer, and travel writer"]}, {"page": "1896 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* November \u2013 Margaret Eleanor Parker, social activist, first president of the British Women's Temperance Association (born 1827)"]}, {"page": "White Ribbon Association", "response": ["thumb|Margaret Eleanor Parker", "The British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA) was founded following a meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1876 featuring American temperance activist \"Mother\" Eliza Stewart.

Margaret Bright Lucas, who toured with Stewart during these meetings, succeeded as BWTA president in 1878. The BWTA achieved greater success under her successor, Lady Henry Somerset, but ultimately British temperance was destined to achieve less than its American counterpart. Lady Henry was succeeded by Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle, known as \"The Radical Countess\" for her opposition to alcohol consumption. Lucas was however, an important link in the Anglo-American women's reform networks as well as being a pioneer in British women's temperance.", "* Margaret Eleanor Parker"]}]}}
