The historian Ronald Hutton stated that in Crowley's youth, he was \"a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man\" who \"set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms\", while being shielded from an \"outraged public opinion\" by his inherited wealth. Hutton also described Crowley as having both an \"unappeasable desire\" to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and \"a tendency to quarrel savagely\" with those who challenged him. Crowley biographer Martin Booth asserted that Crowley was \"self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel\". Similarly, Richard B. Spence noted that Crowley was \"capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty\". Biographer Lawrence Sutin noted that Crowley exhibited \"courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will\" while at the same time showing a \"blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men\". The Thelemite Lon Milo DuQuette noted that Crowley \"was by no means perfect\" and \"often alienated those who loved him dearest.\""]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["|Martin Booth || The Industry of Souls || Dewi Lewis"]}, {"page": "George Clooney", "response": ["He next co-starred with Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey in the war comedy film The Men Who Stare at Goats, which was directed by Heslov and released in November 2009.

Author Martin Booth notes that this etymology was popularized by Harry J. Anslinger in the 1930s, during his campaigns against the drug. However, linguist Jason D. Haugen finds no semantic basis for a connection to mallihuan, suggesting that the phonetic similarity may be \"a case of accidental homophony\". Cannabis is not known to have been present in the Americas before Spanish contact, making an indigenous word an unlikely source."]}]}}
