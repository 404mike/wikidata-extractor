The new owners hired Eddie Firmani, an assistant with Palace, as the team's first head coach. Firmani brought over three Palace players, Stewart Jump, Mark Lindsay and Hammond for the 1975 season. Amazingly, the Rowdies won the league championship that season, with Hammond recording clean sheets in all three playoff games. He saved a penalty in the 1\u20130 quarter-final win over Toronto, and survived an onslaught of Portland shots in the Rowdies 2\u20130 Soccer Bowl victory. However, Hammond returned to Palace at the completion of the loan and was replaced by U.S. great Arnie Mausser. Although Mausser had been capped by the U.S. national team, and was selected as the top NASL goalkeeper for 1976, Firmani preferred Hammond and negotiated his purchase from Palace. Hammond made a total of 117 Football League appearances for Palace. At this time Palace was attempting to rebuild its team and used the funds from Hammond's sale to purchase striker Jeff Bourne from Derby County. Hammond played with the Rowdies through the 1977 season, but was traded to the Houston Hurricane after only eight games of the 1978 season. He then spent the 1979 and 1980 seasons in Houston, being named to the NASL second team All Star list in 1979. While in Houston, Hammond was introduced to professional indoor soccer when a new league, the Major Indoor Soccer League began operations in 1978\u20131979. Hammond played for the Houston Summit Soccer which drew many of its players from the NASL Hurricane. Hammond was selected as the Goalkeeper of the Year as the Summit ran to the best record only to fall to the champion New York Arrows in the playoff semifinals."]}, {"page": "1976 North American Soccer League season", "response": ["|Stewart Jump, Tampa Bay"]}, {"page": "1975 North American Soccer League season", "response": ["|Stewart Jump, Tampa Bay"]}]}}
