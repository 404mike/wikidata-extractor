The son of a farm labourer, he became known for his celebrations of the English countryside and sorrows at its disruption. His poetry underwent major re-evaluation in the late 20th century: he is now often seen as a major 19th-century poet. His biographer Jonathan Bate called Clare \"the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*John Clare (1793\u20131864, E)"]}, {"page": "July 13", "response": ["*1793 \u2013 John Clare, English poet and author (d. 1864)"]}, {"page": "Lincoln, England", "response": ["*John Taylor (1781\u20131864) publisher of John Keats and John Clare, attended Lincoln Grammar School."]}, {"page": "May 20", "response": ["*1864 \u2013 John Clare, English poet (b. 1793)"]}, {"page": "Peterborough", "response": ["The John Clare Theatre within the new central library,Managed on behalf of the council by Vivacity , an independent, not-for-profit organisation with charitable status; there are also nine branch libraries and a mobile library. again on Broadway, is home to the Peterborough Film Society.

The publication in 1798 of Lyrical Ballads, with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native Lake District, or his feelings about nature\u2014which he more fully developed in his long poem The Prelude, never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured.
