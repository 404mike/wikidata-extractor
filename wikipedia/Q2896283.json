He studied at Trinity College, Dublin, but may not have graduated.His survey of land in Ireland was of land claimed by Oliver Cromwell under the Act of Settlement. Worsley was from 1651 a physician in Cromwell's army, but took to surveying around 1653. His work was too rough-and-ready to be of practical help to arranging land grants to soldiers, and William Petty took over.He was an alchemical writer, and associate of Robert Boyle, and knew George Starkey from 1650. He was a major figure of the Invisible College of the 1640s.Worsley associated with the circle around Samuel Hartlib and John Dury, and on their behalf visited Johann Rudolph Glauber in 1648-9. Worsley followed the theories of Michael Sendivogius and Clovis Hesteau. He was a projector in the manufacture of saltpeter (1646). Later, probably in the mid-1650s, he wrote De nitro theses quaedam. He also took up the alchemy of transmutation, with Johann Moriaen and Johannes Sibertus Kuffler.He was also probably heterodox in religion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nicholas Barbon", "response": ["During the later part of his life, Nicholas Barbon wrote extensively on economic theory.  His pamphlets and books on political economy are considered important because of their innovative views on money, trade (especially free trade) and supply and demand. His works, especially A Discourse of Trade (written in 1690), influenced and drew praise from 20th-century economists such as John Maynard Keynes (in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money) and Joseph Schumpeter. Karl Marx cites his work, notably A Discourse on Coining the New Money Lighter (1696) in Capital. eg pp 125-7 in the 1970 Penguin edition. He was one of several late 17th-century economic, social and political theorists with a medical education background; contemporaries included Benjamin Worsley, Hugh Chamberlen, William Petty and John Locke."]}, {"page": "Samuel Hartlib", "response": ["In 1641, Hartlib wrote Relation of that which hath been lately attempted to procure Ecclesiastical Peace among Protestants.

They also proposed economic, technical and agricultural improvements, notably through Sir Cheney Culpeper and Henry Robinson.J. P.

Worsley in 1646 was experimenting on saltpetre manufacture, and Charles Webster in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography argues that he was the \"prime mover\" of the Invisible College at this point: a network with aims and views close to those of the Hartlib Circle with which it overlapped. Margery Purver concludes that the 1647 reference of \"invisible college\" was to the group around Hartlib concerned to lobby Parliament in favour of an \"Office of Address\" or centralised communication centre for the exchange of information. Maddison suggests that the \"Invisible College\" might have comprised Worsley, John Dury and others with Boyle, who were interested in profiting from science (and possibly involving George Starkey).R.
