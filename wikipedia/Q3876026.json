The first was that of Miss Battle-Axe, a strict, sadistic schoolteacher who talks with a Scottish accent, in the 3D children's musical adventure comedy Horrid Henry: The Movie, directed by Nick Moore. She found her character to be \"irresistible\", explaining to The Guardian: \"It's very British material to me, and I've always been strangely attracted to these extreme characters\". The film was panned by critics but was a commercial success in the UK. Her second performance of 2011 was that of a mother of a man suffering from a malignant cancerous tumor in the drama 50/50, directed by Jonathan Levine and co-starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen. The film was a critical and commercial darling upon its release. David Schmader, writing in the Stranger, praised the \"stellar\" cast and felt that Huston \"roars back to prominence with a twisty performance as Adam's barely contained mess of a mom\". The unsuccessful The Big Year, Huston's last live-action film of 2011, featured her as an \"avid birder\", who \"captains ocean-going expeditions\"."]}, {"page": "51st British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* The Full Monty \u2013 David Freeman and Nick Moore"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Moore (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Nick Moore (Canadian football) (born 1986), Canadian football player", "*Nick Moore (musician) (born 1983), American musician", "*Nick Moore (filmmaker), British film director", "*Nick Moore (American football) (born 1992), NFL long snapper"]}, {"page": "American Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Feature Film \u2013 Comedy or Musical", "response": ["| About a Boy || Nick Moore"]}, {"page": "Horrid Henry: The Movie", "response": ["Horrid Henry: The Movie is a 2011 British 3D children's musical adventure comedy film, directed by Nick Moore and produced by Allan Niblo, Rupert Preston, Mike Watts and Lucinda Whiteley, who wrote it.
