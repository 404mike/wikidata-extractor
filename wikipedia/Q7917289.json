Some of its proposals, such as Big Ben being influenced by a minaret in Syria, or a pre-Islamic Syrian church being an Islamic influence on Notre-Dame de Paris, were criticised by reviewers, some of whom perceived a simplified narrative that reduced the scale of Persian and Byzantine influence on both Islamic and Western architecture.", "Darke's citation of Wren has been described as out of context by some reviewers. Vaughan Hart, a Professor of Architecture at the University of Bath and author of a book on Wren's Eastern influences, wrote that \"Wren had self-interested reasons for making this claim, and knew very little about Arab buildings\". In the Asian Review of Books, Peter Gordon wrote that Wren's statement on Gothic architecture was actually one of contempt, though the double dome he used on St Paul's is of Middle Eastern origin. Aaron Betsky, director of the School of Architecture + Design at the Virginia Tech College of Architecture and Urban Studies, criticised the hypothesis that Filippo Brunelleschi based the design of the Duomo of Florence from Arab texts."]}, {"page": "The Conway Photographic Library", "response": ["# Vaughan Hart"]}]}}
