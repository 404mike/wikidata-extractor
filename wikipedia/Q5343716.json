He is incorrectly said to have been educated at Manchester grammar school. He served in a Manchester warehouse for two years, where he acquired knowledge which was afterwards useful to him in conducting mercantile cases. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 3 November 1827, was a scholar of Brasenose from 1829 to 1832, and graduated B.A. in 1831, and M.A. in 1834.\nHe was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 16 June 1835, and went the Northern Circuit, of which he became leader in 1860. He settled in practice at Liverpool, and was assessor of the Court of Passage there from 1852 until his death. In November 1853 he was advanced to be a Queen's Counsel, became a bencher of his inn soon afterwards, and in 1863 was gazetted attorney-general and queen's serjeant of the County Palatine of Lancaster. By that date he had removed to London. On 14 July 1865, after a severe contest among four liberals, he was elected at the 1865 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester. He held the seat until his death in 1867, speaking occasionally on legal subjects and on the reform of the representation.James was a sound practical lawyer, with a great knowledge of commercial law, especially in its relation to shipping. His arguments before the courts were always pointed, and his management of cases admirable. He was excellent in cross-examination. Too prone to take offence, he brooked no interference in court, and often had unseemly disputes with the judges.\nJames died of typhoid fever, while returning from a holiday in Switzerland, at the H\u00f4tel du Louvre, Paris, on 3 November 1867, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, London, on 9 November. He married in 1835 Mary, daughter of Edward Mason Crossfield of Liverpool.\nJames was the writer of a pamphlet entitled Has Dr. Wiseman violated the Law? 1851, which went to a second edition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Fitzjames Stephen", "response": ["Stephen's practice at the Bar was an uneven one, though he appeared in two notable cases. In 1861\u201362, he unsuccessfully defended the Reverend Rowland Williams in the Court of Arches against charges of heresy, though he was ultimately acquitted in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1865\u201366, Stephen was retained (along with Edward James QC) by the Jamaica Committee, which sought to prosecute Edward Eyre, Governor of Jamaica, for his excesses in suppressing the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865. They produced a legal opinion, which charged Eyre and his officers with serious breaches of English criminal law, some of them capital.

He spoke to Charles Russell and William Court Gully about the possibility of leaving England and instead working for the British Consular Courts in China. However, Herschell soon made himself useful to Edward James, the then leader of the Northern Circuit, and to John Richard Quain, the leading stuffgownsman. For the latter he noted briefs and drafted legal opinions. When, in 1866, Quain took silk, Herschell inherited much of his junior practice. In 1872, Herschell took silk and the following year, he became Recorder of Carlisle."]}, {"page": "James (surname)", "response": ["* Edward James (disambiguation), multiple people", "** Edward James (martyr) (c. 1557\u20131588), English Catholic priest and martyr", "** Edward James (clergyman) (1569\u20131610?), Welsh clergyman and translator", "** Edward James (judge) (1757\u20131841), judge and politician in Nova Scotia", "** Edward James (barrister) (1807\u20131867), English barrister", "** Edward James (Nova Scotia politician) (1825\u20131909), politician in Nova Scotia, Canada", "** Edward James (cricketer) (1896\u20131975), Welsh cricketer", "** Edward James (1907\u20131984), British poet and art patron", "** Edward James (historian) (born 1947), Professor of medieval history at University College Dublin"]}, {"page": "Edward James (disambiguation)", "response": ["Edward James (1907\u20131984) was a British poet and art patron.", "Edward James may also refer to:", "*Edward James (barrister) (1807\u20131867), English barrister", "*Edward James (priest) (1569\u20131610?), Welsh priest and translator", "*Edward James (historian) (born 1947), Professor of medieval history at University College Dublin", "*Edward James (judge) (1757\u20131841), judge and politician in Nova Scotia", "*Edward James (martyr) (c. 1557\u20131588), English Catholic priest and martyr", "*Edward James (Nova Scotia politician) (1825\u20131909), politician in Nova Scotia, Canada", "*Edward James (Louisiana politician) (born 1981), member of the Louisiana House of Representatives ", "*Edward James (cricketer) (1896\u20131975), Welsh cricketer"]}, {"page": "Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edward James"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1857\u20131868)", "response": ["|Edward James"]}, {"page": "Montague Leverson", "response": ["The Orsini affair trials of Simon Fran\u00e7ois Bernard and Edward Truelove in 1858 brought Leverson prominence as a radical lawyer, acting as solicitor for their defences, with Edward James as counsel.
