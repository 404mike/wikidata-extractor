Hogg was pleased with his performance on the tour, however a broken bone in his right hand meant he missed the first two weeks of county cricket back in England. In June 2010 Kyle got his best batting figures when he hit 88 in the Roses match against Yorkshire at Old Trafford. Batting at number 10, he helped Lancashire avoid the follow-on and left the ground to a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd. In the same match, Hogg took his 100th\u00a0first-class wicket: that of Adam Lyth who was in the running to become the first batsman to reach 1,000 in the season. At the start of August, Hogg was awarded his county cap. The following month he scored his second first-class half-century of the season, on this occasion 81 against Hampshire. In the same match he took 4\u00a0wickets for 53\u00a0runs (4/53), his best for the season. In nine first-class matches for Lancashire in 2010, Hogg scored 301\u00a0runs (including two half-centuries) at an average of 33.44 and took 20\u00a0wickets at average of 32.50."]}, {"page": "Paul Farbrace", "response": ["Following the appointment of Andrew Strauss as Director of Cricket, Peter Moores was sacked as coach. However, Farbrace stayed on, acting as Interim head coach for the series against New Zealand. The first squad selected under his stewardship was similar to Moores' final squad, with Adam Lyth being confirmed as the man to replace the retiring Jonathan Trott.", "Adam Lyth was replaced as opener for the series against Pakistan, with Moeen Ali being moved up the order to replace him. England drew the first game with debutant Adil Rashid helping to almost force a result for England. England lost the next two games of the series, by 178 runs and 127 runs. The decision to move Moeen Ali up the order did not work out, and England's spinners didn't offer a genuine threat throughout the series. Despite the setback, England continued their progression which started under Farbrace in limited overs cricket. Despite losing the opening match of the ODI series, they recovered to win it 3\u20131, winning the last three games by a margin of 95 runs, 6 wickets and 84 runs respectively. While England had modified their approach on the sub continent, they still played an aggressive brand of cricket, scoring 355 in the final game of the series. With the T20 World Cup approaching, England experimented in their selections for the three T20 internationals. Sam Billings and James Vince both came into the side and impressed, with Vince being named man of the series, while Chris Jordan returned to the side and demonstrated his credentials as a death bowler, bowling the Super Over in the final game of the series to help England win it 3\u20130, and make it six victories on the bounce."]}]}}
