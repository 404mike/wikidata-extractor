This statement was made against the backdrop of the Parliamentary expenses scandal and Moran's expense claims for \u00a323,000 to eliminate dry rot in her second home in Southampton. Two days later, Moran announced she would not stand at the next general election, but Rantzen said she was still considering standing herself and confirmed her candidacy on 28 July 2009. Rantzen stood for election in Luton South against eleven other candidates, of whom four were independent. At the May 2010 election, Rantzen came fourth with 4.4% of the vote, behind the three main parties. In accordance with UK parliamentary electoral process, Rantzen lost her deposit, as only candidates receiving over 5% of the total votes cast have their deposit returned. Labour Party candidate Gavin Shuker won the seat with 34.9% of the vote, the Conservatives got 29.4% and the Liberal Democrats 22.7%."]}, {"page": "Radio Academy Awards", "response": ["|The Stephen Rhodes Consumer Programme"]}, {"page": "Rhodes (surname)", "response": ["*Stephen Rhodes (radio presenter), former weekday daytime presenter on BBC Three Counties Radio"]}, {"page": "Steal (game show)", "response": ["Steal is a British game show that aired on ITV from 17 February to 12 May 1990.
