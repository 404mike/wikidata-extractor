He had played a few times for Surrey in 1895 and 1897, when the team was a powerful force in county cricket, but his performance was so modest that he had difficulty justifying his place.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1897 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Frederick Bull, Willis Cuttell, Frank Druce, Gilbert Jessop, Jack Mason"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Frank Druce"]}, {"page": "1897 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden \u2013 Frederick Bull, Willis Cuttell, Frank Druce, Gilbert Jessop, Jack Mason  "]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Frank Druce \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Druce", "response": ["*Frank Druce (1875\u20131954), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1897\u201398", "response": ["* Frank Druce (Cambridge University and Surrey)"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Frank Druce (1895)"]}, {"page": "Eliot Druce", "response": ["Druce married Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Sir Charles Swann on 16 September 1913.Eliot Albert Cross Druce, The Peerage.

Academically gifted, he took a first-class degree in Part I of the Cambridge University Classical Tripos, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1895. His single game of first-class cricket came after he had technically left the university: he appeared as a middle-order batsman in the match against Yorkshire in 1896 and scored 61 runs in his only innings. The report of the match in The Times bracketed Moore's name in terms of success with those of three other Cambridge batsmen, Cuthbert Burnup, Frank Druce and Gilbert Jessop, all of whom went on to play Test cricket. Moore's subsequent cricket was less illustrious: he played minor matches for Herefordshire (not then a Minor Counties team) and one Minor Counties Championship game in 1902 for Dorset."]}]}}
