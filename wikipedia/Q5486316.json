He is one of the very few Test cricketers to have made his claims for inclusion purely upon his performance for an Oxbridge university. He had played a few times for Surrey in 1895 and 1897, when the team was a powerful force in county cricket, but his performance was so modest that he had difficulty justifying his place.", "link_mentions": {}}}
