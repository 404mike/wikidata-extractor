In Raz's 1979 book The Authority of Law, he criticised what he called the \"weak social thesis\" to explain law. He formulates the weak social thesis as \"(a) Sometimes the identification of some laws turn on moral arguments, but also with, (b) In all legal systems the identification of some law turns on moral argument.\" Raz argues that law's authority is identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. This view he calls \"the sources thesis\". Raz suggests that any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.ch. 2, Joseph Raz, The Authority of Law (1979) Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that held that there was \"no necessary connection\" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists\u2014including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green\u2014reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder)."]}, {"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["The list of noted legal scholars includes H.
