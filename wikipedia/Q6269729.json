Moving into more recent times, the label has broadened its sonic palate \u2013 as has Plastician. Terrorhythm currently represents some of the most exciting young musicians associated with today's future beats movement, housing artists such as AWE, GANZ, Louis Futon and Krane among others within its ranks; many of whom have been releasing on the label since their debut releases. More recently, Plastician has been exploring the experimental trap offshoot, wave music for which his \"Wavepool\" mixes have become recognized as the main reference point for the birth of the genre. He has recruited artists representing the wave sound such as Noah B, Sorsari, Deadcrow, Glacci, & Yedgar to release via Terrorhythm and bring the underground internet sound to new ears from 2016 onward.", "| align=center | Joker"]}, {"page": "TC (musician)", "response": ["| Joker featuring Silas"]}, {"page": "Streets of Rage", "response": ["The soundtracks have been critically acclaimed.

She would go on to consequently meet fellow British musician Sampha, most known as SBTRKT's main collaborator and live member, and together the duo worked on \"Valentine\", which was released on a special edition, heart-shaped vinyl by Young Turks on 2011's Valentine's Day. An accompanying music video for the collaboration was directed by Marcus S\u00f6derlund, and released on the same day via the Youtube channel of Young Turks. Along with \"Nervous\", \"Valentine\" and \"The Vision (Let Me Breathe)\", another collaboration with DJ Joker, led Ware to a record deal with PMR Records in the same year. The singer was also featured on Ceremonials, the 2011 album by British indie rock band Florence and the Machine, in which her good friend Florence Welch is the lead singer, having contributed and credited as a backing vocalist for seven tracks on the album, with four of which were released as singles to promote the album. Following her record deal with PMR Records, Ware released her first physical single as a solo artist, titled \"Strangest Feeling\" on 21 November 2011, further confirming that she was \"hard at work\" on her first studio album, which was due to release \"some time\" in 2012. The singer then announced the title of her first full-length album to be Devotion, which was scheduled to be released on 20 August 2012.
