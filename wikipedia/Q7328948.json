What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity.\". Drawing on the work of classicist Richard Seaford and literary theorist Marc Shell on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an \"ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion\"."]}, {"page": "List of University of Exeter people", "response": ["*Richard Seaford, Classics"]}, {"page": "Charon's obol", "response": ["In the view of Richard Seaford, the introduction of coinage to Greece and the theorizing about value it provoked was concomitant with and even contributed to the creation of Greek metaphysics.Richard Seaford, \"Reading Money: Leslie Kurke on the Politics of Meaning in Ancient Greece,\" Arion 9 (2002) 145\u2013165, introducing ideas developed in Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy (Cambridge University Press, 2004).

The Phrygian king's famous \"golden touch\" was a divine gift from Dionysus, but its acceptance separated him from the human world of nourishment and reproduction: both his food and his daughter were transformed by contact with him into immutable, unreciprocal gold. In some versions of the myth, Midas's hard-won insight into the meaning of life and the limitations of earthly wealth is accompanied by conversion to the cult of Dionysus. Having learned his lessons as an initiate into the mysteries, and after ritual immersion in the river Pactolus, Midas forsakes the \"bogus eternity\" of gold for spiritual rebirth.Richard Seaford, Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy (Cambridge University Press, 2004), pp. 143, 150, 259, 284, 306\u2013308, limited preview online."]}, {"page": "Classical Association", "response": ["*Professor Richard Seaford (2008\u20139)"]}, {"page": "Seaford, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Seaford"]}]}}
