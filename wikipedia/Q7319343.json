He worked for BBC current affairs, the Financial Times and Daily Telegraph, was development director for Nation Newspapers in Nairobi, Kenya, and wrote widely on the press and technology and health issues such as AIDS and cancer.\nHe wrote books on politics, technology, health and Roman history.  His most recent and third Roman book was a biography of Pliny the Younger, covering among other things his political concerns and anxieties, his literary style and his relationship with women: Pliny the Younger: A life in Roman Letters, published in November 2013 by Bloomsbury Academic.His first Roman history book, published by Duckworth in March 2009, was The Roman Book \u2013 Books, Publishing and Performance in Classical Rome, a literary-historical reassessment of the publishing business in classical Rome.The second, published by Duckworth in September 2010, constructs a political and military narrative for Zenobia of Palmyra, one of the great women of classical antiquity. Winsbury argues that the romantic image of Zenobia as a beautiful, intellectual but chaste Arab queen of the desert and the political perception of her as a regal woman whose feminine qualities lifted her above her misfortunes, do less than justice to Palmyra's most controversial ruler.  There was a dark side to her that shows her as a ruler who did what real rulers do and she should be judged on this.\nWinsbury held an MA from Oxford University and a PhD from London University in classical studies.  During his National Service, he was sent to Cambridge University to qualify as a Russian interpreter. He was the Labour candidate for Southend West in the 1964 General Election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Vassall", "response": ["He then wrote a memoir, published in 1975 as Vassall: the autobiography of a spy. He described it as \"a kind of self-justification, not as regards my espionage activities, but as regards my position as a human being, and, perhaps, my ability to make and keep friends in all walks of life\".Vassall 1975, p. 191. Rex Winsbury called the book \"[a] cross between Jennifer's Diary [the society column of Queen magazine] and James Bond, ... bewildering both for Vassall's own transparent naivety and social snobbism, ... and for the equally transparent naivety of the British Foreign Office and security forces\". Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 George Mikes similarly concluded that it was Vassall's \"vanity, his childish snobbery, his devouring ambition and complete lack of humour that pushed him so deep into the quagmire\"."]}, {"page": "Young Fabians", "response": ["| 1961-1962 || Rex Winsbury"]}, {"page": "Rex (given name)", "response": ["* Rex Winsbury (1935\u20132015), English journalist and author "]}, {"page": "Gurth Hoyer-Millar", "response": ["He stood as a Liberal candidate in Kensington South in 1959.
