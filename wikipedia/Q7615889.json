Rosette and lower pitchers are ovate and slightly swollen in the basal half of the pitcher cup, becoming approximately cylindrical towards the pitcher mouth and exhibiting a slight hip. They are very small, growing to only 6\u00a0cm in height by 3\u00a0cm in width. A pair of wings (\u22646\u00a0mm wide) typically runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup, with fringe elements measuring up to 4\u00a0mm in length. The peristome is cylindrical and up to 5\u00a0mm wide. It bears ribs up to 0.5\u00a0mm high and spaced up to 0.8\u00a0mm apart, which terminate in teeth up to 1.5\u00a0mm long. The pitcher lid or operculum is elliptic or sub-orbicular and does not bear any appendages. It measures up to 3.5\u00a0cm in length by 3\u00a0cm in width. The structure of the spur, which is inserted near the base of the lid, is unknown. The lower pitchers are predominantly red with yellowish blotches and have a uniformly yellow peristome and inner surface. The upper surface of the lid is of similar pigmentation to the pitcher exterior."]}, {"page": "Nepenthes kerrii", "response": ["In January 2008, Catalano made two attempts to reach the site discovered by the rangers. Both proved unsuccessful due to the time and effort involved. That same month Catalano met with Stewart McPherson on the Thai mainland and informed him of the findings. McPherson then travelled to Tarutao National Marine Park on his own. After what he described as \"the worst treck of my life\", McPherson succeeded in relocating the plants. He returned with seeds and photographs, mostly of the upper pitchers.", "The first published description of N.\u00a0kerrii appeared in volume I of Stewart McPherson's 2009 monograph, Pitcher Plants of the Old World. It was included as an \"incompletely diagnosed taxon\" under the name N. sp. Trang. McPherson wrote that it was known with certainty only from Thailand, but had also been reported from the Malaysian island of Langkawi. He considered it to be most closely related to N.\u00a0kampotiana, writing that \"[m]ore extensive observations are required in order to determine whether this taxon merely represents variation within N.\u00a0kampotiana or is a distinct species\".", "In Pitcher Plants of the Old World, Stewart McPherson writes that populations of N.\u00a0kerrii \"are extremely inaccessible and not threatened at present\"."]}, {"page": "Stewart R.
