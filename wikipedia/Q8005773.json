As a serving captain, Pechell had copied and then adapted the system used by Philip Broke, writing a pamphlet on the topic entitled \"Observations upon the Defective Equipment of Ships' Guns\". When he was elevated to a position of authority he determined to spread his ideas in the service. Supported by King William IV, who had been a serving naval officer and a keen proponent of gunnery training, Pechell worked with Sir Howard Douglas and Sir William Bowles to establish HMS Excellent, the Royal Navy's first gunnery training ship. He was also involved in the appointment of Sir William Symonds as Surveyor of the Navy. For his work in naval administration, Pechell has been described as \"one of the architects of the professional navy of the later nineteenth century.\"Pechell, Sir Samuel John Brooke, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J.
