In 1870\u20131873 the church underwent Victorian restoration. St Michael's is a Grade II* listed building.  The west window holds stained glass of archangels Michael, Raphael and Gabriel. It was installed in 1935 by Morris & Co., but the designs dating from 1860 were created by William Morris and Ford Madox Brown. The north side of the chancel has another Morris & Co. stained-glass window, showing St Matthew. This was designed by Edward Burne-Jones and installed in 1872\u20131874.  Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon is buried in the churchyard; the angel on his tomb was sculpted by George Frampton. Next to the church is the former rectory, built in the 19th century.", "The original village developed around the church, which remains along with a few dwellings around it. The population started to decline after 1349, so that by the 19th century it consisted only of a few scattered farmhouses. This has been attributed at various times to bubonic plague, to emparking and to sheep farming.  Late in the 19th century, a group of houses was built on the Lechlade\u2013Faringdon road, designed by the architect Ernest George for Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon, as part of a social improvement project. Many people now regard this as Eaton Hastings, as the remaining buildings of the original settlement are hidden down a narrow lane."]}, {"page": "Lady Victoria Leatham", "response": ["Leatham is the daughter of David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter, then known as Lord Burghley, and his second wife, Hon.
