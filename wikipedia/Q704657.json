Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland \u2013 so they became known as the \"team of Macs\". The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893\u201394 season.

The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990. His successor was Noel White who became chairman in 1990. In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years, became chairman.

Arsenal were elected to the top flight in spite of only finishing fifth the previous season (1914\u201315, as competition had been suspended for most of World War I). This promotion came at the expense of other clubs, most notably Arsenal's arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It has been alleged that Norris bribed or in some way unduly influenced the voting members of the Football League, in particular the league chairman and owner of Liverpool, John McKenna; at the League's AGM. Many sources claim that McKenna made a speech recommending Arsenal's promotion ahead of Spurs thanks to the former's longer spell in the League (Arsenal joined in 1893, Spurs in 1908), although Wolves \u2013 who finished in 4th ahead of Arsenal \u2013 had been members of the league since its inception in 1888. However, it is unlikely that this actually happened as no newspapers from the time reported it. Although no firm proof has ever been offered, Norris's other activities, including the scandal that led to his downfall, are often cited as circumstantial evidence. Some claim that Norris 'bribed' McKenna, although this is pure speculation especially as it appears that McKenna is unlikely to have made the speech. Probably more likely is that he lobbied McKenna, who fearful of Norris exposing the corruption in the league at the time (Manchester United and Liverpool were accused of fixing the last game of the season) yielded to Norris's request to promote Arsenal to Division 1 based on their longer spell in the league and their professional status."]}, {"page": "County Monaghan", "response": ["* John McKenna (1855\u20131936), the first manager of Liverpool Football Club along with W.E.

The new South Stand was designed by renowned football architect Archibald Leitch. and was opened by the then Football League President, John McKenna on 29 August 1925, just before the kickoff before a home match against Middlesbrough. Leitch's South Stand was built with an all wooden upper section with flip-turn seats in the central section, with wooden benches at the west and eastern ends. A lower terrace 'paddock' standing section below pitch level was also built. The South Stand also featured new players dressing rooms previously located in the Fratton Park pavilion. A \"tunnel\" built directly from within the South Stand dressing rooms lead to the pitch at the halfway line point. As the new South Stand was much larger than the original, the Fratton Park pitch was reduced in width from 77 to 73 yards.", "On 7 September 1935 the new North Stand was opened by John McKenna, who had also opened Fratton Park's new South Stand ten years earlier.  The official opening ceremony took place over loudspeakers from the directors box of the South Stand just before kickoff of the game against visitors Aston Villa, ironically captained by former Portsmouth defender Jimmy Allen! The new \"Jimmy Allen Stand\" as it was unofficially nicknamed, contained a new roofed all-standing upper tier, while a rebuilt lower North Terrace was built over the site of the old North Stand site.

The decision infuriated Tottenham and their supporters. It has been frequently alleged that Arsenal chairman Sir Henry Norris used underhand dealings in order to bring this about, although nothing has been proven.These allegations range from political machinations to outright bribery.
