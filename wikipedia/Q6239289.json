He became active in the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders, being its Clyde delegate from 1901 to 1909, while also serving on his parish council for the Independent Labour Party.  The union sponsored his candidacy in Glasgow Govan at the 1906 general election; he took 29% of the vote, but was not elected.  He stood for the Labour Party, again unsuccessfully, in the 1907 Liverpool Kirkdale by-election.In 1909, Hill was elected General Secretary of the Boilermakers.  He was able to strengthen the union in his first five years by focussing on craft unionism and controlling apprenticeships.  During World War I, he articulated some of the concerns of Red Clydeside on the national stage, working to get the Munitions of War Act amended, and becoming increasingly important in the Labour Party.  In 1917, he served as President of the Trades Union Congress.Hill remained General Secretary until 1936, but struggled to maintain the union's bargaining power in the face of the Great Depression.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boilermaker", "response": ["* John Hill - trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["thumb|120px|John Hill"]}, {"page": "John Hill", "response": ["John Hill may refer to:", "* John Hill (planter) (1824\u20131910), Scottish-born American industrialist and planter", "* John Hill (businessman) (1847\u20131926), Australian coach-horse operator", "* John Hill (cartoonist) (1889\u20131974), New Zealand cartoonist", "* John Hill (game designer) (1945\u20132015), American designer of Squad Leader and other wargames", "* Dean Koontz or John Hill (born 1945), American author", "* John Hill (screenwriter) (died 2017), American screenwriter and television producer", "* John Hill (actor) (born 1978), American musical theater actor", "* John Hill (conductor) (born 1843), Australian church organist and choirmaster", "* John Hill (musician) (active from 1993), American guitarist with the Apples in Stereo and Dressy Bessy", "* John Hill (record producer) (active 2008 and after), American record producer, songwriter, and musician", "* John Hill (active 1968), English bassist in Band of Joy", "* John Hill, British conspiracy theorist and creator of the 2007 documentary 7/7 Ripple Effect", "*John Hill (courtier) (before 1690\u20131735), British general and courtier, brother of Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham", "*John Hill (British Army officer) (fl. 1777\u20131783), British Army officer during the American War of Independence", "*John Hill (Royal Navy officer) (c. 1774\u20131855)", "*John Hill (Indian Army officer) (1866\u20131935), British general", "*John Hill (died 1408), English Member of Parliament and Justice of the King's Bench", "*John Hill (MP for Wycombe) (fl. 1436), English MP for Wycombe", "*John Hill (MP for Dorchester) (1589\u20131657), English Member of Parliament for Dorchester", "*Sir John Hill, 3rd Baronet of the Hill baronets of Hawkstone (1740\u20131824), British MP for Shrewsbury", "*John Hill (British politician) (1912\u20132007), British Member of Parliament and Member of the European Parliament", "* John Hill (North Carolina politician) (1797\u20131861), United States Representative from North Carolina", "* John Hill (Virginia politician) (1800\u20131880), United States Representative from Virginia", "* John Hill (New Jersey politician) (1821\u20131884), United States Representative from New Jersey", "* John Hill (Texas politician) (1923\u20132007), American lawyer and politician", "* John Hill (Florida politician) (born 1931)", "*John Hill (Australian politician) (born 1949), member of the South Australian House of Assembly", "* John Hill (botanist) (1716\u20131775), English botanist, editor, journalist, and novelist", "* John Hill (physician) (1931\u20131972), American plastic surgeon", "* John Hill (English cricketer) (1867\u20131963), English cricketer", "* John Hill (baseball) (1876\u20131922), American Negro leagues player", "* John Hill (Irish cricketer) (1912\u20131984), Irish cricketer", "* John Hill (New Zealand cricketer) (1930\u20132002), New Zealand cricketer", "* John Hill (Queensland cricketer) (born 1956), Australian cricketer", "*John Hill (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1891\u20131892), Scottish footballer", "*John Hill (rugby union) (fl. 1925), Australian rugby union player", "*John Hill (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1940s and 1950s", "*John Hill (American football) (1950\u20132018), American football player", "*John Hill (New Zealand footballer) (born 1950), Irish-born New Zealand footballer", "*John Hill (boat racer) (1933\u20131993), British powerboat racer", "*John Hill (wrestler) (1942\u20132010), Canadian wrestler", "*John Hill (ice hockey) (born 1960), American ice hockey coach", "* John Hill (classicist) (1747\u20131805), Scottish minister and classicist", "* John Hill (explorer) (c. 1810\u20131860), English explorer of South Australia", "* John Hill (bishop) (1862\u20131943), English clergyman, inaugural Suffragan Bishop of Hulme", "* John Hill (trade unionist) (1863\u20131945), British trade unionist", "* John Hill (police officer) (1914\u20132004), British HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales", "* John Hill, a character in Cheers", "*James John Hill (1811\u20131882), English painter", "*John Hill & Company, a former British toy company", "*John Hill House, a historic home in Erie, Pennsylvania", "*John Hills (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers", "response": ["Knight retired in 1899, and although F.
