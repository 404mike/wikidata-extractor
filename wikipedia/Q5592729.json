In his early days at the club, he was in charge of cleaning the boots of John Charles. He became the youngest ever player to play in a senior match for the club when he came on as a substitute in place of Graham Coldrick to make a goalscoring debut during a 3\u20131 win over Leyton Orient on 13 November 1965 at the age of 16 years and 236 days, a record which stood for 41 years until it was broken by Aaron Ramsey in 2007. His performance during his debut persuaded manager Jimmy Scoular to promote him to the starting line-up for the following match and Toshack found the net again, scoring a brace during a 4\u20133 victory over Middlesbrough. In his first season in professional football, he scored six goals during nine appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "List of people from Newport", "response": ["* Graham Coldrick"]}, {"page": "List of Newport County A.F.C. players", "response": ["| Graham Coldrick||2 Apr 2015||1970\u20131975||157||10||", "*  Graham Coldrick"]}, {"page": "Coldrick", "response": ["* Graham Coldrick (born 1945), Welsh footballer"]}]}}
