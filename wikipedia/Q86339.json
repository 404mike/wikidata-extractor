(\"Why do other nations hate us?\"), Hirschfeld answered his own question by arguing that it was the greatness of Germany that excited envy from other nations, especially Great Britain, and so had supposedly caused them to come together to destroy the Reich. Hirschfeld accused Britain of starting the war in 1914 \"out of envy at the development and size of the German Empire\". Warum Hassen uns die V\u00f6lker? was characterized by a chauvinist and ultra-nationalist tone, together with a rather crass Anglophobia that has often embarrassed Hirschfeld's admirers today such as Charlotte Wolff, who called the pamphlet a \"perversion of the values which Hirschfeld had always stood for\".", "By the time of the book burning, Hirschfeld had long-since left Germany for a speaking tour that took him around the world; he never returned to Germany. In March 1932, he stopped briefly in Athens, spent several weeks in Vienna and then settled in Zurich, Switzerland, in August 1932.Charlotte Wolff, Magnus Hirschfeld: A Portrait of a Pioneer in Sexology (London: Quartet Books, 1986).  While he was there, he worked on a book which recounted his experiences and observations while he was on his world tour and it was published in 1933 as Die Weltreise eines Sexualforschers (Brugg, Switzerland: B\u00f6zberg-Verlag, 1933). It was published in an English translation in the United States under the title Men and Women: The World Journey of a Sexologist (New York City: G. P.

Was bleibt (What Remains), described her life under Stasi surveillance, was written in 1979, but not published until 1990.  Auf dem Weg nach Tabou (1995; translated as Parting from Phantoms) gathered essays, speeches, and letters written during the four years following the reunification of Germany. Leibhaftig (2002) describes a woman struggling with life and death in 1980s East-German hospital, while awaiting medicine from the West. Central themes in her work are German fascism, humanity, feminism, and self-discovery. In many of her works, Wolf uses illness as a metaphor. In a speech addressed to the Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft (German Cancer Society) she says, \"How we choose to speak or not to speak about illnesses such as cancer mirrors our misgivings about society.\" In \"Nachdenken \u00fcber Christa T.\" (The Quest for Christa T), the protagonist dies of leukemia. This work demonstrates the dangers and consequences that happen to an individual when they internalize society's contradictions. In Accident, the narrator's brother is undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor a few days after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had occurred.

He became a patient of the psychiatrist Dr Charlotte Wolff, who helped him to recover both his sense of identity and his ability to write. He remained rootless, however, wandering from place to place, and still drinking heavily. A legacy from an uncle in 1957 enabled him to settle in the Somerset village of Batcombe, where he bought and restored a house and created an elaborate Italianate garden. In 1950 he published an anthology of short stories about childhood titled First View, dedicated to the memory of Denton Welch, a writer he greatly admired.  Closely allied to this anthology was his novel In the Making (1952), which drew upon his memories of Wells House, but was relocated from the Malverns to the Quantocks. Subtitled 'The Story of a Childhood', it traces the life of a boy called Randal Thane between the ages of six and fourteen, concentrating particularly upon his passionate obsession with an older boy called Felton.  There followed a long silence\u2014Green always found writing difficult\u2014which was broken in 1972 with the appearance of a volume titled The Power of Sergeant Streater. Published as a novel, it is in fact three interrelated novellas each illustrating what Frank Tuohy identified as Green\u2019s principal theme: \u2018the relationship of an older man with a younger, of a different class or race\u2019. Green spent the rest of his life working on a related volume of short stories 'on the theme of the failure of Love' and set in Ceylon and Morocco, where he went on holiday in 1975. Diagnosed with lung cancer, he committed suicide in 1977.
