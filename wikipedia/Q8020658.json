He scored their first competitive goals in both the Southern League and Western League, and scored 21 goals from 46 appearances in his one year at Home Park.\"Jack Peddie profile\". Greens on Screen. Retrieved 23 August 2010. He returned to Manchester United in 1904, and as well as being named club captain, he was again the club's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 32 league appearances. The arrival of high-scoring Jack Picken in May 1905 meant Peddie was unable to repeat the feat for a third time in four seasons, although he still made an important contribution with 20 goals in all competitions as Manchester United finished in second place to win promotion back to the First Division for the first time since 1894. Peddie was also replaced as captain by Charlie Roberts prior to the 1905\u201306 season. Having played in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots international trial match twice while playing for Third Lanark and twice with Newcastle, he made his fifth appearance in the fixture as a Manchester United player in March 1906, but would never be selected for the Scottish national team. In January 1907, he returned to Scotland, signing for Heart of Midlothian in a triple transfer with Dick Wombwell and William Yates. In total across his two spells with Manchester United, Peddie scored 58 goals in 121 appearances."]}, {"page": "William Yates", "response": ["*William Yates (died 1558 or 1559) (1505\u20131558/1559), Member of Parliament for Lincoln", "*William Yates (college president) (1720\u20131764), College of William & Mary's fifth president (1761\u20131764)", "*William Yates (missionary) (1792\u20131845), Baptist missionary to India", "*William Yates (athlete) (1880\u20131967), British Olympic racewalker", "*William Yates (footballer) (1883\u2013?), English footballer", "*William Yates (politician) (1921\u20132010), British and Australian politician", "*William Yates Atkinson (1854\u20131899), governor of Georgia, US", "*William Yates Peel (1789\u20131858), British Tory politician", "*William Yates Redpath (1922\u20131989), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| William Yates"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|IL ||||William Yates"]}]}}
