Born in 1934, he attended Kirkcaldy High School and the University of Edinburgh. He received his PhD from the University of Cambridge, where he subsequently took up a permanent post. He has been a fellow of Churchill College since its foundation, and was President of its Senior Combination Room (SCR) until 2010.\nIn 1965, with Hirsch, Whelan, Pashley and Nicholson, he published the seminal text Electron Microscopy of Thin Crystals. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1978 and awarded their Royal Medal in 1999. In 1992 he was awarded the Guthrie Medal and Prize. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1995. He was head of the Cavendish Laboratory from 1989 to 1997.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of physicists", "response": ["*Archibald Howie \u2013 U.K. (born 1934)"]}, {"page": "Cavendish Laboratory", "response": ["# Archibald Howie, FRS, emeritus professor"]}, {"page": "Hughes Medal", "response": ["The medal has on occasion been awarded to multiple people at a time; in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton \"for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles\", in 1981 by Peter Higgs and Tom Kibble \"for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary-particle theory\", in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine \"for their elucidation of the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which subsequently led to the plate tectonic hypothesis\" and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and M.
