He was born in or about 1777 at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, of a family long settled in that town, and was educated at St. Peter's school there. When about eighteen years of age he came to London to seek a profession. He thought he saw an opening in the careful application of chemistry to pigments and dyes. War on the continent, by stopping the supply of madder from Holland, threatened to impede his progress. This obstacle, however, led him to consider the nature of its cultivation, and with a well-devised project he waited on Sir Joseph Banks for his advice, and, as he hoped, his co-operation. Sir Joseph, after unsuccessfully attempting to cultivate madder in Essex, had made up his mind that it could not be done in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Primary color", "response": ["Red, yellow, and blue as primaries became a popular notion in the 18th and 19th centuries. Jacob Christoph Le Blon, an engraver, was the first to use separate plates for each color in mezzotint printmaking: yellow, red, and blue, plus black to add shades and contrast. Le Blon used primitive in 1725 to describe red, yellow, and blue in a very similar sense as Boyle used primary. Moses Harris, an entomologist and engraver, also describes red, yellow, and blue as \"primitive\" colors in 1766. L\u00e9onor M\u00e9rim\u00e9e described red, yellow, and blue in his book on painting (originally published in French in 1830) as the three simple/primitive colors that can make a \"great variety\" of tones and colors found in nature. George Field, a chemist, used the word primary to describe red, yellow, and blue in 1835. Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, also a chemist, discussed red, yellow, and blue as \"primary\" colors in 1839. \u2013 English translation by John Spanton"]}, {"page": "Alizarin", "response": ["The madder dyestuff is combined with a dye mordant. According to which mordant used, the resulting color may be anywhere from pink through purple to dark brown. In the 18th century the most valued color was a bright red known as \"Turkey Red\". The combination of mordants and overall technique used to obtain the Turkey Red originated in the Middle East or Turkey (hence the name). It was a complex and multi-step technique in its Middle Eastern formulation, some parts of which were unnecessary. Additional 18th century history at  The process was simplified in late 18th-century Europe. By 1804, a dye maker George Field in Britain had refined a technique to make lake madder by treating it with alum, and an alkali,George Field's notes are held at the Courtauld Institute of Art. See  that converts the water-soluble madder extract into a solid, insoluble pigment.  This resulting madder lake has a longer-lasting color, and can be used more efficaciously, for example by blending it into a paint.  Over the following years, it was found that other metal salts, including those containing iron, tin, and chromium, could be used in place of alum to give madder-based pigments of various other colors. This general method of preparing lakes has been known for centuries but was simplified in the late 18th and early 19th centuries."]}, {"page": "1854 in science", "response": ["* September 28 \u2013 George Field (born c.1777), English colour chemist"]}, {"page": "1835 in art", "response": ["*George Field \u2013 Chromatography; or, a Treatise on Colours and Pigments, and of their Powers in Painting."]}, {"page": "Tertiary color", "response": ["The RYB color terminology outlined above and in the color samples shown below is ultimately derived from the 1835 book Chromatography, an analysis of the RYB color wheel by George Field, a chemist who specialized in pigments and dyes."]}, {"page": "Pierre Jean Robiquet", "response": ["Another type of natural red dye used from times immemorial was obtained from madder root in Central Asia and Egypt, where it was grown as early as 1500 BC.
