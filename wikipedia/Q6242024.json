From the age of twelve, he worked as a farm labourer. He later worked as a counter of cargoes of slate as they were loaded on to ships in Bangor, in modern Gwynedd.  Unusually for someone of his background, he was not only a musician and a poet but proficient in several languages.  He is noted mainly for his interest in astronomy: he constructed his own telescopes \u2013 including \"Jumbo\", reputed to be the first silver-on-glass reflecting telescope in Wales.He died at Bangor in 1898.", "link_mentions": {}}}
