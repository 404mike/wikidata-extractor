He also played for Watford, Norwich City, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Coventry City. He made three appearances for the England national team in 1999.\nSherwood began his coaching career at Tottenham Hotspur, progressing from assistant first team coach to manager in a five-year spell, then managing the club from December 2013 to his dismissal in May 2014. He resumed his managerial career at Aston Villa in February 2015, taking them to that season's FA Cup final and saving them from relegation from the Premier League, until being sacked in October 2015.

With Lerner still on board, but unwilling to spend following the stock market crash of 2008, the club was uncompetitive for several seasons, culminating in the 2014\u201315 season, when Lambert was sacked in February 2015 after the team managed just 12 goals in the first 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history. Tim Sherwood succeeded him, and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final. However,  the club sold two of its star players Christian Benteke and captain Fabian Delph in the summer transfer window and did not adequately replace them. Villa struggled in the 2015\u201316 season, and Sherwood was sacked following six consecutive defeats.  He was replaced by R\u00e9mi Garde, a French manager with no Premier League experience. He left after five months with Villa lying at the bottom of the table; his reign included a woeful club-record 19 game winless run.

He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied, \"Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?\"The Ones That Got Away...Zidane  \u2013 VitalFootball.co.uk, 2006 Also towards the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for \u00a31.2\u00a0million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division.

In 2020\u201321 it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for 2021\u201322. Majority-owned by celebrity chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is Carrow Road Stadium. It has strong East Anglian rivalry with Ipswich Town. The club has enjoyed much success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has won two Football League Cups, and finished third in the inaugural Premier League in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions. Perhaps its most famous result came in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup, in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but been unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated Manchester United from the FA Cup in 1959 and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some highly-rated talent of that era, including striker Chris Sutton, winger Ruel Fox, defender Andy Linighan, midfielder Mike Phelan, midfielder Tim Sherwood and striker Justin Fashanu. The club's successful managers have included Ken Brown, Ron Saunders, Dave Stringer, Mike Walker, Nigel Worthington and Paul Lambert."]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Tim Sherwood"]}, {"page": "Borehamwood", "response": ["*Tim Sherwood, former footballer and manager."]}, {"page": "Harpenden", "response": ["* Tim Sherwood, former Tottenham Hotspur and Blackburn Rovers player who lived in Harpenden during his coaching days at Tottenham"]}, {"page": "Dagnall", "response": ["Tim Sherwood, a former professional footballer, lives on the edge of the village.
