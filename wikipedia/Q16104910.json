His hair styles were at their most fashionable during the Vogue sittings of the late 1960s and early 1970s, for which he would \"illustrate the exuberant moment when hair was somehow a totem of youth and freedom in itself\". He worked with many of the leading photographers of the day, including Clive Arrowsmith, Terence Donovan, David Bailey and Barry Lategan for fashion publications such as Vogue and Queen, often collaborating with designer Zandra Rhodes who favoured Leonard's colourist, Daniel Galvin, whose vibrant shades of pinks, blues and reds, were revolutionary at the time.His film work is also renowned. He worked closely with film director Stanley Kubrick on many of his films. In its heyday, his five-storey salon in London's Mayfair was considered the epicentre of all that was fashionable in the late 1960s and 1970s. His clients included Jack Nicholson, Jerry Hall, Meryl Streep, Warren Beatty, David Frost, Barbra Streisand, Catherine Deneuve, Marsha Hunt (creating her famous bald look), Jean Shrimpton, Ronnie Kray, Reggie Kray, Bianca Jagger, The Beatles, Scott Walker (singer), Liza Minnelli, Faye Dunaway, David Bowie (in his Ziggy Stardust phase), Bob Marley (when he needed his dreads unpicked), John F.
