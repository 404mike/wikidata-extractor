Pan-European magazine Music & Media stated that \"falsettos are rare. Here's the first convincing high-pitched male pop singer since Jimmy Somerville. Duke has apparently listened a lot to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On.\" ", "Upon the 1995 re-release, they wrote that the song \"with its mid-tempo romanticism is one of those songs that sound awfully familiar, even though it's the first time you hear them.\" A reviewer from Music Week's RM Dance Update said it is \"a great track in its own right \u2014 lots of Latin flavour topped with Duke's cool vocals\". In 1996, Music Week rated it four out of five, noting that it is \"evoking the infectious vibes of War's Low Rider and the vocal splendour of Marvin Gaye.\" The magazine's James Hamilton declared it as a \"simply marvellous Marvin Gaye/William DeVaughn-ish falsetto soulful European smash with a madly infectious summery humming 'la-la-la-la-la na' refrain\"."]}]}}
