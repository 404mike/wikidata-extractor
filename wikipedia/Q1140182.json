Notable CD recordings where his music is featured include his Changing Moods: suite for organ op.59 on Animal Parade (REGCD346) played by William Saunders; Variations on a Theme of Guillaume de Machaut, Op. 65 in Grand Organ of Chester Cathedral played by Philip Rushforth; and his Six Pieces, op.33 in The King's Trumpeter (PRCD189), with Crispian Steele-Perkins, and Stephen Cleobury, organist, and director of the King's College Choir, Cambridge.
