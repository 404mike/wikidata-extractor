Nonetheless, Hunt remains Liverpool's record league goalscorer with 244 goals. Under Bill Shankly, Hunt won two league titles and an FA Cup. In August 1964 he also scored the first ever goal seen on the BBC's Match of the Day. Regarded as one of Liverpool's greatest ever players, Hunt was referred to as Sir Roger by the club's fans, ranking 13th on the 100 Players Who Shook the Kop, an official fan poll.\nHunt was a member of the England national team which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup, playing in all England's six games, scoring three times.

Greaves and Hunt were indeed picked for the three group games against Uruguay, Mexico and France, but in the latter game, Greaves suffered a deep gash to his leg which required stitches, and Hurst was called up to take his place in the quarter final against Argentina."]}, {"page": "July 20", "response": ["*  1938   \u2013 Roger Hunt, English footballer (d. 2021)"]}, {"page": "1966 FIFA World Cup Final", "response": ["England's third goal has remained controversial ever since the match. According to the Laws of the Game the definition of a goal is when \"the whole of the ball passes over the goal line\". English supporters cited the good position of the linesman and the statement of Roger Hunt, the nearest England player to the ball, who claimed it was a goal and that was why he wheeled away in celebration rather than attempting to tap the rebounding ball in. Modern studies using film analysis and computer simulation have shown that the whole ball never crossed the line \u2013 only 97% did. Both Duncan Gillies of the Visual Information Processing Group at Imperial College London and Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman of the Department of Engineering Science at University of Oxford have stated that the ball would have needed to travel a further 18\u00b14\u00a0cm to fully cross the line.
