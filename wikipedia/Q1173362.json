Velvet Underground members Lou Reed, John Cale and Sterling Morrison contributed to the album, with Nico, Reed and Cale co-writing one song, \"It Was a Pleasure Then.\" Chelsea Girl is a traditional chamber-folk album, with strings and flute arrangements by producer Tom Wilson. Nico had little say in its production, and was disappointed with the result; she said in 1981: \"I still cannot listen to it, because everything I wanted for that record, they took it away. I asked for drums, they said no. I asked for more guitars, they said no. And I asked for simplicity, and they covered it in flutes! ... They added strings, and\u2014 I didn't like them, but I could live with them. But the flute! The first time I heard the album, I cried and it was all because of the flute.\"Nico quoted in Dave Thompson's liner notes for the 2002 Deluxe re-issue of The Velvet Underground & Nico, which includes all five Velvet collaborations for Chelsea Girl.

In Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990), Christgau called it the best double album since the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. (1972) and said it expanded upon, rather than compromised, the Clash's driving guitar sound in a \"warm, angry, and thoughtful, confident, melodic, and hard-rocking\" showcase of their musical abilities. According to the English music writer Dave Thompson, London Calling established the Clash as more than \"a simple punk band\" with a \"potent\" album of neurotic post-punk, despite its amalgam of disparate and occasionally disjointed musical influences. Don McLeese from the Chicago Sun-Times regarded it as their best album and \"punk's finest hour\", as it found the band broadening their artistry without compromising their original vigor and immediacy. PopMatters critic Sal Ciolfi called it a \"big, loud, beautiful collection of hurt, anger, restless thought, and above all hope\" that still sounds \"relevant and vibrant\". In a review of its 25th anniversary reissue, Uncut wrote that the songs and characters in the lyrics cross-referenced each other because of the album's exceptional sequencing, adding that \"The Vanilla Tapes\" bonus disc enhanced what was already a \"masterpiece\"."]}, {"page": "Steppenwolf (band)", "response": ["After Kay disbanded Steppenwolf,  former members Goldy McJohn and Nick St. Nicholas formed a \"revival act\" called \"New Steppenwolf\".

Among those players were vocalist Tom Holland and drummer Steve Riley of future W.A.S.P. and L.A. Guns fame. Glen Bui who went on to work with Goldy McJohn until he died in 2017. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll described these bands as \"unprofessional, bogus versions\" of Steppenwolf. Although Kay and Edmonton had originally licensed the use of the \"New Steppenwolf\" name, they later sued for breach of the contract.

According to Brett Callwood, it abandoned the \"groove-ridden, feel-based songs\" of the band's first two albums in favor of a more anthemic hard rock approach inspired by Williamson, who co-wrote the album's eight songs with Pop. Similarly, music critic Joe S. Harrington said that the hard rock album demonstrated a \"totally overpowering\" sound, \"a sledgehammer attack of brutal ill will\", while author Dave Thompson noted Pop's \"nihilistic hard rock bellowing\" throughout. In another analysis, PopMatters writer Iain Ellis said the album can be seen in retrospect as punk metal, while Tucson Weeklys Jarret Keene deemed it \"garage-punk-metal\" fusion."]}, {"page": "...I Care Because You Do", "response": ["According to AllMusic, the album finds James \"pairing his hardcore experimentalism with more symphonic ambient material, aligned with the work of many post-classical composers\" such as Philip Glass. Writer Dave Thompson described the album as \"pulling together calm, serene moments then launching into battering and bruising beat-heavy tracks,\" observing that the rhythms shift \"from trancey to hip-hoppish.\" Thompson also noted the influence of modern composers such as Glass. Rolling Stone stated that the music had \"little to do with techno in any of its more popular guises,\" also comparing it to the work of composers Glass and John Cage but asserting that the album draws \"most strongly from hip-hop.

He also said that \"it's a debut from a band that shows potential but haven't yet achieved it.\"  Bleach was considered by Rolling Stone Magazine as \"a moderate hit on college radio and the underground/DIY circuit.\" Robert Christgau regarded it as possibly an \"A\u2013\" record in retrospect, and wrote in The New Yorker, \"Familiar now with Cobain's extraordinary gift, we can hear it loud and clear on the 1989 debut album, Bleach. Cobain's gigantic, goofy, bass-playing buddy Krist Novoselic added drollery to the band's chaotic irreverence.\" In 2000, author Dave Thompson stated \"history [wouldn't] hear a word against [the album]\", but added if \"one just came down from a few decades on Mars, 42 minutes of growly, lo-fi probably wouldn't change your life too much\"."]}, {"page": "The Marble Index", "response": ["Side two opens with \"Julius Caesar (Memento Hodi\u00e9)\", which lyrically explores myths and gods. It features Nico's low, droning harmonium accompanied by Cale's viola. On \"Frozen Warnings\", Cale's arrangement harmonically blends with the pipe organ. It is considered Nico's signature song from her collaboration with Cale; Nina Antonia wrote: \"Of all the strange and wracked numbers on the record, 'Frozen Warnings' is quintessential Nico; lyrics that convey a sorrowful atmosphere and little comfort in the melody.\" The album's dreamlike quality end with its last song, \"Evening of Light\", which has been described as \"frighteningly quiet and hypnotizing\". Nico sings \"Midnight winds are landing at the end of time\", with harpsichord and Cale's staccato viola building until the latter gains ground and sways with the tympani's \"roar and clatter\". The 1991 reissue of The Marble Index also includes the outtakes \"Roses in the Snow\" and \"Nibelungen\". In the latter, Nico's vocals are unaccompanied. The full version (with instrumental accompaniment) was included in the 2007 compilation The Frozen Borderline \u2013 1968\u20131970; according to Dave Thompson of AllMusic, \"It rises to equal any of Nico's subsequent performances or compositions.\"", "When he heard The Marble Index, Jac Holzman decided that \"there was no question of not releasing it\" despite its lack of commercial appeal; Holzman saw it as a work of art, rather than a product. The album was released in November 1968 with little promotion. A music video for \"Evening of Light\", featuring Iggy Pop and the other Stooges, was shot by art collector Fran\u00e7ois de Menil in 1969. He has described the clip as \"a sort of pre-MTV promotional item for [The Marble Index]. An early pop promo.\" De Menil was interested in shooting a short film with the singer, and she agreed with the condition that they would film it in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Pop's hometown, and that he would be featured in it. Dave Thompson described the clip as follows: \"It was shot in a cornfield behind [Pop's house], barren and stubbly in the late winter chill, Nico in white and windswept, Pop in whiteface, manic and agitated, caressing and crushing the mannequin parts that littered the field, while a wooden cross is raised before them and set ablaze as night falls.\" Elektra Records\u2014who had not agreed to finance the project\u2014rejected the music video, as did \"any other media outlets that de Menil approached\"."]}, {"page": "Little Games", "response": ["More recent reviews have generally found fault with Little Games. AllMusic's Bruce Eder gave it three out of five stars and wrote \"If almost any group other than the Yardbirds had released Little Games, it would be considered a flawed but prime late-'60s psychedelic/hard rock artifact instead of a serious step backward, and even a disappointment\". An AllMusic review by Dave Thompson of the expanded edition Little Games Sessions & More began \"the day producer Mickie Most moved in on the Yardbirds was the day the Yardbirds' own values moved out. The union was a lousy idea from the start\". The New Rolling Stone Album Guide writer also gave the album three out of five stars, calling it \"a disastrous attempt at conventional pop\".  The Yardbirds themselves were just as critical \u2013 Page reportedly regarded Little Games as \"horrible\" and Jim McCarty described Mickie Most as \"a protagonist in our downfall\"."]}, {"page": "David Thomas", "response": ["* David Thomas, pen name of Dave Thompson (author) (born 1960), English writer about music"]}, {"page": "The Lords of the New Church", "response": ["More melodic and slickly produced than most punk, their music both reached a broader audience than that of many bands in the genre and alienated hardcore punk fans. The band presented a stylized tribal identity around their appearance and their music that fans embraced: the writer Dave Thompson asserts this represented \"the first time since the Sex Pistols' Bromley Contingent fanbase [that] a band had succeeded in grafting its own identity onto its audience without first paying obeisance to the gods of highstreet fashion. Their stage antics became notorious early in their career, with Bators stunts on one occasion reportedly resulting in his clinical death for several minutes.", "Is Nothing Sacred?, their second album released in September 1983, saw the band diversifying musically, incorporating new wave, classic rock and ska, along with synths, horns and a greater emphasis on the bass. Like their first album, Is Nothing Sacred? was produced by the band themselves, except for its first single - a cover version of \"Live for Today\" (#91 UK) - which was produced by Todd Rundgren. The success of the album's second single \"Dance with Me\" (#85 UK), a song that according to Dave Thompson's Alternative Rock came \"close to a hit\", was hampered when the video directed by Derek Jarman was pulled from MTV's rotation because, according to writer Colin Larkin, mistaken concerns were voiced about pedophilia. The song was later covered by Nouvelle Vague in 2006."]}]}}
