Students of high schools face a possibility of bullying and other adverse behaviors over Facebook every day. Many studies have attempted to discover whether Facebook has a positive or negative effect on children's and teenagers' social lives, and many of them have come to the conclusion that there are distinct social problems that arise with Facebook usage. British neuroscientist Susan Greenfield stuck up for the issues that children encounter on social media sites. She said that they can rewire the brain, which caused some hysteria over whether or not social networking sites are safe. She did not back up her claims with research, but did cause quite a few studies to be done on the subject. When that self is then broken down by others by badmouthing, criticism, harassment, criminalization or vilification, intimidation, demonization, demoralization, belittlement, or attacking someone over the site it can cause much of the envy, anger, or depression."]}, {"page": "The Big Question (TV series)", "response": ["* Part 4 \u2013 \"Why Am I Me?\" presented by Susan Greenfield"]}, {"page": "Australian Science Media Centre", "response": ["South Australian Premier Mike Rann established the centre following a recommendation from Adelaide Thinker in Residence, Baroness Susan Greenfield.
