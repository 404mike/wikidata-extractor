She taught violin locally. After the Japanese invasion, Chambers travelled for five days through the jungle from Malaya to Singapore and succeeded in getting her daughter evacuated to Perth in Australia. She was also evacuated but the Vyner Brooke, her ship, was bombed and destroyed. She was interned in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, her husband sent to another. In 1943 she founded a vocal orchestra with Margaret Dryburgh, writing out the music from memory. Chambers was reunited with her family and returned to Malaya. She retired in 1952 to Jersey where she composed music for, and directed the St. Mark's Church choir in St. Helier. After the war the music produced in the camps was performed widely. Her work and time in the camp was the inspiration for the film Paradise Road."]}]}}
