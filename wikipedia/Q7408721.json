She later finds out Charlie has been murdered, and asks his colleague Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to continue with the re-fit. She also calls Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) \"cheesey\" when he attempts to flirt with her. Jodie enjoys arguing with rival chip shop worker, Cilla Battersby-Brown (Wendi Peters). Cilla states that Jodie has the body of her father, Jerry Morton, and the face of 'Jabba The Hut'.

Wilf arrived on the street with his granddaughter, Jodie (Samantha Seager). He called Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) \"chief\", which Dev took to be a racist comment. However, Jodie explained that Wilf was not good with names and that this was simply his method of addressing people informally. Wilf was an ex-convict with an extensive criminal record, mostly as a result of his tendency to take part in scams, a trait that many members of his family had inherited. On discovering his granddaughter Mel's (Emma Edmondson) ambition to join the police, Wilf claimed he felt it was like \"being stabbed\". However, despite his former misdemeanours, Wilf was loyal to his family and after realising that his past record may have affected Mel and her application to join the Police, Wilf faked his death on Father's Day 2007, by submitting a false obituary to the Weatherfield Gazette. This action lead to Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) and Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) believing he was dead - with the former arranging her own wake, despite still being alive, as a result. Wilf's intentions towards Blanche were never fully established; while the two often bickered, Blanche was genuinely shocked when she believed Wilf was dead, and Wilf made several flirtatious comments towards her. Although he appeared to live with his son and grandchildren, Wilf's appearances suddenly ceased and he was not referred to when his family left the Street in September 2008.
