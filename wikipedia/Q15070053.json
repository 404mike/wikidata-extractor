Gavaghan was tasked with the speedy rehabilitation of 30,000 prisoners in the Pipeline, a collection of British internment camps for suspected Mau Mau fighters. That month he took control over the detention camps in Mwea and initiated Operation Progress, designed to break prisoner morale and ensure that the fighters confessed and recanted their support for rebellion through the use of force. Gavaghan had disdain for securing voluntary confessions through winning over the \"hearts and minds\" of the prisoners, later saying, \"I think honestly if people said 'hearts and minds' to me I simply said yuck.\" Once order was restored there, Gavaghan implemented the \"dilution technique\", whereby small groups of prisoners from Manyani were brought to Mwea and, through the use of physical force, were changed into new prison uniforms and had their heads shaved. Gavaghan's staff and other teams of administrators then forced the Mau Mau to denounce their allegiance to the rebellion. Most confessions were involuntary. Gavaghan was personally involved in the violent treatment of prisoners, and once recalled in an interview that later in his tenure at the camps he personally reviewed recalcitrant detainees and selected some among them to be executed."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2001", "response": ["*Tom Askwith, 90, British Olympic rower (1932 Summer Olympics, 1936 Summer Olympics) and a colonial administrator."]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College", "response": ["* Tom Askwith, Olympic Rower"]}, {"page": "Askwith (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Tom Askwith (1911\u20132001), a British Olympic rower and a colonial administrator in Kenya"]}]}}
