In February 2017, producer Simon Kinberg stated that the post-credits scene of X-Men: Apocalypse, in which Essex Corporation acquires James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine's blood, correlates with how Alkali-Transigen eventually acquires DNA and begins creating clones for use as weapons. Depicted as an 11-year-old girl who was created from Logan's DNA and thus; is Wolverine's biological daughter; instead of his clone, she has inherited her father's bone claws and advanced healing powers. Laura was one of several mutant children who had been slated for termination when Transigen created X-24, an adult double of Wolverine that has been programmed to be loyal to Transigen. However, a Transigen nurse named Gabriela Lopez helped her escape. Even at her young age, she was already a very formidable combatant; on several occasions, she singlehandedly faced off a whole detachment of Reavers. With Logan's help, she eventually made her way to a remote location on the border between the United States (via North Dakota) and Canada escaping across the border, although Logan is killed in battle with X-24 when he deliberately overdoses on a drug designed to stimulate his weakening healing factor so that he can fight one last time, subsequently dying in Laura's arms."]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 January \u2013 Dafne Keen, British and Spanish actressDebrett's Peerage and Baronetage, 148th edition, Debrett's Peerage Ltd, 2011, p. 799"]}, {"page": "JoBlo.com", "response": ["|Dafne Keen"]}, {"page": "Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer", "response": ["** Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney / X-23 \u2013 Logan"]}, {"page": "Galicians", "response": ["File:Dafne Keen by Gage Skidmore.jpg|Child actress Dafne Keen"]}, {"page": "List of breakout characters", "response": ["|X-23 first appeared in the self-titled tenth episode of the third season of the animated television series X-Men: Evolution, and is a clone and later adoptive daughter of Wolverine.
