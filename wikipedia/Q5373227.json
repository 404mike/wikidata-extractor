This led to the Stoke directors attempting to terminate his employment. Wilkinson protested to the FA and the law stated that all returning service men would be entitled to their old job. He won his case and Stoke made him fourth choice 'keeper behind Dennis Herod, Emmanuel Foster and Arthur Jepson. He seemed to be drifting to retirement but due to Herod being injury prone Wilkinson was handed a last chance against Blackpool on the penultimate fixture of the 1948\u201349 season. He produced a fine display including a wonder save from City legend Stanley Matthews as Stoke won 3\u20132. His final appearance for Stoke came against his old club Huddersfield Town and Wilkinson kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw. He was aged 41 years and 275 days the fourth oldest player to appear for Stoke."]}, {"page": "Arthur Jepson", "response": ["After suffering a serious spinal injury in February 1946 he missed the rest of the season. He also missed the start of the 1946\u201347 season, this time due to his cricketing commitments. In September 1946, having played 92 games for the Vale over all competitions, he was sold to local rivals Stoke City for a \u00a33,750 fee, as Vale manager Billy Frith believed Heppell to be a superior goalkeeper. Stoke manager Bob McGrory used Jepson in 31 games in 1946\u201347, ahead of rivals Dennis Herod and Emmanuel Foster, as the \"Potters\" recorded a fourth-place finish in the First Division \u2013 a club record finish that still stands. However Jepson made just one appearance in 1947\u201348, with Herod being the preferred stopper."]}, {"page": "Dennis Herod", "response": ["He returned to Stoke in 1945 and was an ever-present in the final war league season of 1945\u201346 and played in Burnden Park disaster. Stoke supporters enjoying the clubs title challenge in 1946\u201347 soon dubbed their 'keeper as Dennis 'Herod the king' although Herod was more circumspect about his value in the side. \" I was probably the weakest link in the team. I had not the physique to be a really top class goalkeeper like Frank Swift or Ted Ditchburn. I did however have fast reflexes and I could move quicker than most\". He played in the title decider against Sheffield United on the final day of the season, Stoke lost 2\u20131. Heord admits to smoking heavily and gambling, vices which led him to be good friends with Neil Franklin where he was a groomsman at his wedding and received an offer to accompany him to Colombia. Herod declined not wanting to move away from the Potteries where his wife ran a successful grocery business. In the summer of 1950 McGrory signed Don Clegg from Bury to replace Herod. Stoke lost their first two games of the 1950\u201351 season and Clegg was unceremoniously dropped. Herord saw off numerous more challengers, including Arthur Jepson, Emmanuel Foster and Frank Elliott in his 14 years at the Victoria Ground, although his shortcomings meant that McGrory was constantly seeking a replacement."]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Emmanuel Foster"]}, {"page": "1942\u201343 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Emmanuel Foster"]}, {"page": "1943\u201344 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Emmanuel Foster"]}, {"page": "1944\u201345 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Emmanuel Foster"]}]}}
