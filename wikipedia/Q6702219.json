Their sound is similar to that of acts such as The Monkees, McFly and Led Zeppelin. They came together in the early part of 2006 to begin work on their debut album People Let's Go, and to film the first part of their television series. They have been signed to Universal Music and the album was released in April 2007. An exclusive download only release of \"Can't Go There Again\" was made available on 3 November 2007. They performed around in Primary Schools, culminating in a main-stage performance at the 21st World Scout Jamboree. This was the height of the band's success and they went their separate ways in 2007, however their fans hope for a reunion. The media has quashed speculation so far, however in late 2011 the youthful-looking Eoin Logan (who was 28 when filming for the show began) was quoted as saying \"I would welcome a return to the band and would love to reprise my role of Tay again. I feel that the character still has a lot of potential and I have a few ideas on how I would like to develop him. A part of me will always be Tay\"."]}, {"page": "Luke O'Reilly", "response": ["Luke O'Reilly may refer to:", "*Luke O'Reilly (alpine skier), British former alpine skier", "*Luke O'Reilly (Bel's Boys), Northern Irish actor and musician", "*Luke O'Reilly (cricketer) (born 1977), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Bel's Boys (TV series)", "response": ["The show stars Graham McKee, Luke O'Reilly and Eoin Logan from the real life \"band\" as Vince, Leon and Tay who send their demo cd to acting manager Ainsley Barter who, being an acting manager, not a band manager, tosses it in the bin. But his 9-year-old daughter, Bel Allanah Scully, listens to it and is instantly a fan. She goes round to their garage where they practice and hang out. Although they are uncertain at first about having a 9-year-old being their manager but she convinces them that the only way for them to get noticed by her dad is to first be managed by herself. In order to get them known they often enlist the help of Ainsley's PA, SJ, her younger brother, Ollie and Bel's best friend, Carina, although her friendship with Bel is often strained by her commitment to the band.", "Leon-Luke O'Reilly"]}]}}
