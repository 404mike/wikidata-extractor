Unlike Pegrum, who employed a traditional rock drumming style, Genockey favoured a more varied drumming style, influenced by both Irish and African drumming, in which he hit, brushed, and rubbed the various surfaces of his drums and cymbals, creating a more varied range of sounds.

Gay Woods provides most of the lead vocals, although the other three members of the band all do the lead singing on at least one song each.  Liam Genockey, who had played drums on the band's previous two albums also departed, so most of the songs employ minimal or no percussion, although Woods plays tambourine or bodhran on several songs, and Dave Mattacks, formerly of Fairport Convention, mans a drum kit on three songs.  The overall result is an album that has a very strong folk flavour, with rather less rock elements than on previous albums, and one that has much in common with Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again.  The tunes tend to be simpler and the performances more subdued, and in some ways the album is a return to the sound the band had on its first three albums.  The album also has a strong Irish influence, with songs such as \"The Old Turf Fire\", \"Erin\", \"The Bonny Irish Boy\", and \"The Parting Glass\" all being of Irish origin.  Woods' vocal style is distinctly different from Prior's, being more earthy and often more 'in character'.   Unusually, the album has no instrumental pieces.
