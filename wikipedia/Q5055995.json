Poole held the seat at the 1945 general election, and when the Lichfield constituency was abolished for the 1950 general election, he was elected for the new Birmingham Perry Barr seat.\nIn 1951, Poole was Parliamentary Private Secretary to President of the Board of Trade (PBT), Harold Wilson. When Wilson resigned from the government in April 1951 in protest at the introduction of National Health Service charges to meet the financial demands imposed by the Korean War, Poole was offered the same role with the new PBT, Hartley Shawcross, but declined to serve, saying \"I declined because I support the views of the three ministers who resigned in opposition to the dentures and spectacles charges and the general rearmament question\".He retired from the House of Commons at the 1955 general election, and died the following year, aged 53.", "link_mentions": {}}}
