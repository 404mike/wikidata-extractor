Local gigs in and around Glasgow were frequent and in May 2004 the band released a self-financed limited edition double A-side single, \"I'm Gonna Get Stabbed\"/\"Ina Lvs Rab\" on CD. The single gained an early and positive review for Glasvegas from Rick Fulton of the Daily Record on 24 December 2004.  The single (along with some early demos) gained (their first) radio airplay and favourable feedback from Jim Gellatly on his radio show 'Beatbreakers' in January 2005, which was broadcast on the now defunct Beat106FM.  Although many make the obvious observation that the band name is a mix of Glasgow (where they are from) and Las Vegas (the world capital of entertainment), the band have made it clear many times that this was never the reason why the band called themselves Glasvegas.  According to James Allan he liked the name Glasvegas as it rolled sweetly off the tongue.  It is a possibility that it is the combination of the Gaelic 'Glas' (grey) with the Spanish 'vegas' (meadow). Another common mistake is that the band name is split into two words \"Glas Vegas\" (especially in the USA) which is incorrect.", "The band opened 2007 with a headline show at King Tuts Wah Wah Hut.  In early February 2007 (with assistance from Alan McGee), the band made a video for one of their demos, \"Daddy's Gone\", which was shot in London and in Glasgow's East End.  This early video helped pave the way for the song's popularity. In late February 2007, James Allan made the decision to post up all the band's demos on MySpace for free download. These free downloads helped foster recognition about Glasvegas and soon their gigs were selling out.  On 8 March 2007, the band took time out to play a low key acoustic gig in Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow.", "After releasing their second limited edition 7\" single, \"It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry\" on 14 February 2008 via Sane Man Recordings, the band opted to sign to Columbia Records part of Sony. On 28 February 2008, Glasvegas won the Philip Hall Radar Award at the NME Awards. On 10 March 2008, Glasvegas travelled to the United States where they recorded their eponymous debut album, Glasvegas, at Brooklyn Recording Studios, Brooklyn, New York. The album was co-produced by James Allan and Rich Costey. Glasvegas also filmed the video for their first single \"Geraldine\" in Brooklyn on 30 April 2008. On return to the UK at the beginning of May 2008, the band embarked on a touring schedule that would continue for over 16 months.  On 23 June 2008, Glasvegas released their first Columbia single \"Geraldine\" which debuted at No.\u00a016 on the UK singles chart. The summer of 2008 also saw the band make their debut at Glastonbury Festival playing the John Peel Stage on 27 June 2008.  On 12 July 2008, Glasvegas played at T in the Park in the Futures Tent.  Further debut festival appearances in the summer of 2008 took place at Oxegen in Ireland and on consecutive days on 18 and 19 July 2008 at the Benicassim Music Festival in Barcelona and Madrid in Spain.  On 20 July 2008, the band played Latitude Festival.  On 13 August 2008, Glasvegas were invited as opening support to Muse at Marlay Park on the outskirts of Dublin, and the following day saw the band play their first support with Kings of Leon at the Brixton Academy.  On 25 August, Glasvegas released their second Columbia single \"Daddy's Gone\" which debuted at No.\u00a012 on the UK Singles Chart.

The first release via BMG was the single \"If\".  The track was released on 8 July 2013. A music video to accompany the release of \"If\" was first released onto YouTube on the same day. The video features William Shatner and is Glasvegas' take on The Old Grey Whistle Test. \"We played on the Late Show with Craig Ferguson in LA a couple of years ago and William Shatner introduced us as he is a fan of the band,\" Allan said. \"We thought it would be a cool thing to add in for the new video since it also has a 'late show' theme. It's a simple live performance by the band with an abstract part in the middle where it looks like the video has been taped over with random visuals. The video has a filter that we wanted to put on it just to make it look even more like you were watching a recording on VCR. Old school!\" The band released their third album Later...When the TV Turns to Static in September 2013. It received generally favourable reviews from critics stalling at No.41 in the UK Charts.
