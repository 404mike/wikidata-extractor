Filming started in Ystad on 12 October 2011. The first days of shooting were stunts and scenes with an animal trainer as Kenneth Branagh did not arrive until 17 October. Scenes were also shot at The Chemistry Hall at the Macklean School in Skurup Municipality. With the local firefighters on standby, a stunt man poured petrol over himself and then set himself alight. This three-minute long film sequence took nine and a half hours to shoot. Filming began on Friday 14 October at 6 pm and wrapped at 3:30 am on Saturday morning. The film crew later came back at the end of October to shoot a scene using headmaster Christin Stigborgs' office. From Tuesday, 24 October and until the end of the week, three streets in central Ystad (Lilla Norregatan, Stora Norregatan and Sladdergatan) had to be closed down for a short time to shoot several scenes."]}, {"page": "Anna Richardson", "response": ["Richardson was in an 18-year relationship with British TV producer Charles Martin and dated comedian Sue Perkins from 2014 before \"amicably splitting\" in 2021."]}, {"page": "British Academy Children's Awards", "response": ["* 2007: Charles Martin"]}, {"page": "Katie and Emily", "response": ["\"Katie and Emily\" is the ninth and penultimate episode of the third series of the British teen drama Skins, which first aired on 19 March 2009 on E4 in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.

The episode focuses on the characters of twins Katie and Emily Fitch (Megan and Kathryn Prescott, respectively) as they prepare for their college's annual ball. Katie refuses to leave home, recovering from being hit in the head with a rock, and faces her weakening control over her sister. Emily, meanwhile, is heartbroken when her girlfriend, Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless), turns down Emily's invitation to the ball, and comes out to her family about her sexuality.", "Lisa Backwell described the filming of the ball as her \"most favourite, most mental day of filming\". At the end of the final take of Pandora's dancing with Doug, the students' head of year, the entire crew danced into shot. Director Charles Martin was initially dubious of whether Megan and Kathryn Prescott would be able to film Katie and Emily's fight well enough, but Kathryn said that on their first rehearsal they \"did it a bit too properly\", ripping out parts of Megan's hair extensions. Emily's accidental punching of Doug during the fight was choreographed so that when Kathryn Prescott punched the air in front of Giles Thomas's face, the camera angle would make it appear that she was actually hitting him. While they were filming, however, Prescott genuinely punched Thomas by accident, causing him to stumble back and step on Megan Prescott's bare foot, which she injured."]}, {"page": "Ruth Barrett", "response": ["|Charles Martin, Declan Lowney"]}, {"page": "Max Steiner filmography", "response": ["|Charles Martin"]}, {"page": "List of Chinese films of 2017", "response": ["| S.M.A.R.T.
