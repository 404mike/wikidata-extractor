During this spell, Millwall played 55 different teams, kept 35 clean sheets, scored 112 goals and conceded 33. This was thanks largely to managers Billy Gray, who laid the foundations, and Benny Fenton, a former player who continued to build on Gray's side. All the players, which included winger Barry Rowan, goalkeeper Alex Stepney and strikers Hugh Curran and Len Julians, were presented with a commemorative gold cigarette lighter by the Football Association. The record was eventually broken by Liverpool, who were unbeaten for 63 games at home between 1978 and 1981.", "|1963\u20131966|| Billy Gray"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Billy Gray"]}, {"page": "William Gray", "response": ["William, Willie, Bill, or Billy Gray may refer to:", "*Billy Gray (comedian) (1904\u20131978), American comedian, comedy club owner, and actor", "*Billy Gray (actor) (born 1938), American actor who portrayed teenager Bud Anderson on TV's Father Knows Best", "*Billy Gray (footballer) (1927\u20132011), English footballer", "*Billy Gray (horse trainer) (died 2016), horse trainer"]}, {"page": "Jeff Whitefoot (footballer)", "response": ["After Billy Gray's death on 11 April 2011, Whitefoot is now the only surviving member of the 1959 FA Cup winning team."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Sirrel", "response": ["From previous managers Jack Wheeler and Billy Gray, Sirrel had inherited a team including Don Masson, David Needham, Bob Worthington and Les Bradd, and his team would become increasingly difficult to beat.
