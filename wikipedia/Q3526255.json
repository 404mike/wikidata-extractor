New Zealand won the toss and batted first again, and although Rutherford and Fleming made starts, they looked in trouble at 138/4.  Martin Crowe turned the innings around though: he and Shane Thomson (69) added 180 for the fifth wicket, a new record against England, with Crowe despatching the ball to all parts of the ground, despite struggling with a leg injury that saw him hobbling around late in the day.  He was eventually caught at midwicket for 142, but Parore and Dion Nash (56) pushed the score up to 476.", "Prior to the Third Test there was considerable debate in the English press about whether Robin Smith and Graeme Hick should retain their places in the England side after their recent failures, and vocal support for the inclusion of Graham Thorpe., Glenn Moore article in The Independent, 29 June 1994, accessed from Cricinfo on 5 April 2007, Peter Hayter article in The Mail, 29 June 1994, accessed from Cricinfo on 5 April 2007  However, the only change to the team saw Darren Gough make his Test debut in place of Paul Taylor.

His score of 197 took 195 balls and contained 30 fours and 3 sixes. The only bowler to contain Lara was Curtly Ambrose who conceded 12 runs from the 45 balls he delivered to him. The second highest score was 39 from Trevor Penney who put on 168 in 31 overs with Lara. The last wicket partnership between Graeme Welch and Tim Munton grew to 68 before the innings was ended. Early in the reply Munton took the wickets of both openers before a 137 run partnership between Allan Lamb and Rob Bailey (54) recovered the situation. Welch, on his Championship debut, took the wickets of Lamb, Bailey and Mal Loye in a 22 ball spell and Northamptonshire lost their last 5 wickets for 27 runs allowing Warwickshire to enforce the follow on. Northamptonshire fared better second time around despite losing their first four wickets by the time the score reached 83. Loye and Kevin Curran (56) repaired the innings so the hosts ended day three with a lead of 84 runs and three wickets remaining. Loye, 99 overnight, reached his century before his seven-hour innings was ended. The resistance was continued by Russell Warren (94) and tail-ender Paul Taylor who took 113 balls for his 26. Needing 228 in 38 overs, Warwickshire won with three balls to spare. Dominic Ostler and Roger Twose (39) shared a fourth consecutive century opening stand while Penney, promoted to number three, added 43."]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Paul Taylor", "|align=left|Paul Taylor", "|align=left|Paul Taylor", "|align=left|Paul Taylor"]}, {"page": "Ashtead Cricket Club", "response": ["* Paul Taylor"]}]}}
