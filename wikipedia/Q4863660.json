He eventually rose to the rank of Post-Captain. He did not see action in many significant engagements, and is chiefly remembered for the accidental loss of his ship to the French, and for the unsuccessful chase of two French ships in the English Channel. He did command a number of ships of the line under several of the leading naval commanders of his time.

The only ship ready and able to pursue the French was HMS Culloden, under the command of Captain Barrington Dacres. He immediately began a pursuit and after a chase, managed to close the French and open fire. Duguay-Trouin, being the weathermost ship, got into Corunna first. The forts defending the port opened fire on Culloden, but she continued to engage Guerri\u00e8re, until almost within the port, at which point she hauled off and returned to the squadron. Culloden suffered four men wounded, whilst Guerri\u00e8re had suffered considerable damage to her masts and rigging and had lost six men killed and 15, including her captain and first lieutenant, wounded."]}, {"page": "James Richard Dacres (Royal Navy officer, born 1788)", "response": ["Dacres was born in Lowestoft on 22 August 1788, the son of Captain, later Vice-Admiral, James Richard Dacres and his wife Eleanor Blandford Pearce.

On 2 September, Touffet's small squadron appeared to windward sailing for the port of Corunna and Dacres was well situated to intercept them, opening fire at long range at 11:50. The French were faster than Culloden however, Duguay-Trouin successfully entering Corunna ahead of Guerri\u00e8re as the Spanish batteries opened fire on the British ship.
