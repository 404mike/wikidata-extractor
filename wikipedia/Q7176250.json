In early 1996, he gained notoriety when he conducted a service for the Newbury bypass protestors.In 1998, he was responsible for three parishes in Cambridgeshire as the rector of Haslingfield (Harlton, Great Eversden and Little Eversden), before resigning from this position in 2005 to relocate to the benefice of Glynde, West Firle and Beddingham. After a brief appearance in the 2003 documentary series The Power And The Glory, he was recruited by the BBC to front a series of religious television programmes looking at different aspects of Christianity and other faiths.\nHe was married to Jacs Owen-Jones, with whom he has four children, but they have divorced.In his BBC documentary How to Live a Simple Life (2009), Owen-Jones tried to live a life without money in the footsteps of Saint Francis of Assisi. His 2006 documentary, The Lost Gospels, discussed the Apocryphal Gospels which were omitted from the canon of the New Testament.
