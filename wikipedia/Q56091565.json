He signed with Walsall in July 2016, and spent the 2016\u201317 season on loan at Chester. He joined Gateshead in July 2017, before returning to the English Football League with Port Vale in July 2018. He moved on to Macclesfield Town in July 2019 and dropped back into the National League to join Wrexham for the 2020\u201321 season.

After Danny Whitaker took temporary charge, on 16 January 2020, Mark Kennedy was appointed head coach. On 29 January, three Macclesfield players (Emmanuel Osadebe, Theo Vassell and Miles Welch-Hayes) approached the EFL and had their contracts terminated ahead of the transfer deadline. Club staff wages for February were also not paid on time, leading the PFA to contact the club. On 9 March, the club was charged with misconduct by the EFL for failing to pay players on time, and was referred to an independent disciplinary commission after failing to fulfil the Crewe and Plymouth fixtures. In April 2020, it was reported that the club had not paid its players for a fifth time, failing to pay March's wages, and later that the first team, backroom staff and most office staff had been put on furlough (temporary leave) due to the COVID-19 pandemic."]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["Building for the 2018\u201319 season, Aspin released ten players and transfer-listed a further four, whilst bringing in ten new signings and five loan players. Incoming were mostly free transfer signings and included promoted Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper Scott Brown, Cambridge United captain centre-half Leon Legge, 30-year old Carlisle United central midfielder Luke Joyce and troubled but talented Peterborough United striker Ricky Miller (signed for an undisclosed fee); also arriving were Alfreton Town winger Brendon Daniels, Aldershot Town Player of the Year Manny Oyeleke, The New Saints centre-back Connell Rawlinson, Gateshead defender Theo Vassell, Stevenage midfielder Tom Conlon, and former AFC Bournemouth loanee Ben Whitfield, whilst former fan's favourite Louis Dodds, teenage striker Idris Kanu, forward Scott Quigley, full-back Mitch Clark and midfielder Lewis Hardcastle also joined on season-long loan deals. The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch. I fully accept results from December have been poor and expected to be higher up the table and know the players are capable of doing that.\""]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 October 2015 || DEF ||  || Theo Vassell || Free agent || Free transfer ||", "| 26 February 2016 || DEF ||  || Theo Vassell || Chorley || 26 March 2016 ||"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2016 || CB ||  || Theo Vassell || Walsall  || Released || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Neil Aspin's first signing of the window was 33-year-old goalkeeper Scott Brown, who had been an ever-present for Wycombe Wanderers when they won promotion out of EFL League Two the previous season. Aspin stated that Brown's experience would help with organising the Vale's young defenders on the pitch. He quickly followed this by bringing in 30-year-old Carlisle United midfielder Luke Joyce on a two-year contract and 24-year-old Alfreton Town winger Brendon Daniels on a six-month contract, describing Joyce as \"vastly experienced\" and Daniels as \"a local lad who is desperate to prove himself\". Next to arrive were centre-backs Leon Legge and Connell Rawlinson, arriving on free transfers after leaving Cambridge United and The New Saints respectively. Aspin said that he hoped the experience of Legge would aid the development of young centre-half Nathan Smith. His sixth signing was central midfielder Manny Oyeleke, who had just left National League side Aldershot Town after picking up their Player of the Year award. After a wait of some weeks, the seventh incoming player was revealed to be attacker Louis Dodds, who joined on a season-long loan from relegated Chesterfield; he had previously played for the Vale from 2008 to 2016. Aspin said that Dodds had been keen on a return to Vale Park and \"he has cost us next to nothing really\". Vale then acquired the services of Peterborough United striker Ricky Miller after paying an undisclosed fee; 29-year-old Miller had scored a remarkable goal tally in the National League but had thus far failed to establish himself in the Football League in a career hindered by legal troubles. Another Peterborough forward then arrived, this time 18-year-old Idris Kanu on a season-long loan, whilst defender Theo Vassell was also signed on a one-year deal from Aspin's former club Gateshead. Going the other way, 20-year-old forward Dan Turner joined Scottish Championship club Falkirk on a six-month loan deal \u2013 which was terminated early on 5 October. Taking his place at Vale Park was Scott Quigley, signed on a season-long loan from Blackpool.

He also transfer listed Connell Rawlinson and Ben Whitfield. Askey himself signed a new three-year contract, whilst Leon Legge and David Worrall also signed contract extensions.
