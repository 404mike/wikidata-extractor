His father Wilfred (1878-1941) was a bassoonist in the Queen's Hall Orchestra and professor at the Royal College of Music. His uncle Edwin (1861-1921), also a fine bassoonist, was a founding member of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1904. His uncle Frank was second trumpet with the BBC Symphony Orchestra.\nCecil studied with his father, won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. There, in 1933, he performed the Mozart Concerto with Orchestra and shortly after was appointed to the London Symphony Orchestra. It was there he met oboist Natalie Caine whom he married in 1938. During the war, he played with the Royal Air Force Central Band alongside Gareth Morris, Leonard Brain, Dennis Brain, Norman Del Mar, Harry Blech, Fred Grinke, Leonard Hirsch, Jim Merrett and James Whitehead.\nWhen demobbed, he joined the New Symphony, then in 1951 was appointed by Walter Legge as principal bassoonist with the Philharmonia Orchestra, playing under such conductors as Guido Cantelli, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer and Arturo Toscanini.\nHe also in demand for inclusion in chamber groups such as Karl Haas's London Baroque Ensemble and the Dennis Brain Quintet, usually with musicians he admired, such as his wife Natalie, Dennis Brain, Wilfred Parry and, especially, fellow bassoonist Paul Draper.\nCecil's instrument, a Buffet-Crampon bassoon which had been presented to his father by the makers, was made to the French 'Buffet' pattern - quite distinct from those of the more modern German 'Heckel' system which he derided as 'mumblephones', but were clearly taking over as instruments of choice. He always made his own reeds.\nHe never held a formal teaching position and only rarely took pupils; his irascible temper was legendary, though he mellowed a little with age and the desire to promote use of antique instruments.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dennis Brain", "response": ["At the start of the Second World War Brain and his brother joined the armed forces. Unlike Germany and Italy, Britain did not exempt musicians from conscription, but the conductor of the Central Band of the Royal Air Force, Wing Commander Rudolph O'Donnell, made considerable, and largely successful, efforts to ensure that, as Walter Legge put it, \"every exceptionally able young instrumentalist knew that a place would be found for him in the RAF Band\". The band became what The Independent described as \"a legendary ensemble\",\"Obituary: Cecil James\" , The Independent, 23 October 2011 and an RAF Symphony Orchestra was a spin-off. With them, Brain made a three-month tour of the US in 1944\u201345, and played during the Potsdam Conference in 1945.", "In November 1953, under the direction of Herbert von Karajan, and accompanied by the Philharmonia, Brain recorded the four Mozart Horn Concertos for Columbia.Notes to Naxos Historical CD set 8.111070   In the same month, together with Sidney Sutcliffe (oboe), Bernard Walton (clarinet) and Cecil James (bassoon), he recorded Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for Four Winds.Schwarzkopf, p. 271 In July 1954, again conducted by Karajan, Brain played the organ part in a recording of the Easter hymn from Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana.Gamble and Lynch, p. 83 With Sutcliffe, Walton, James and the pianist Walter Gieseking he recorded Mozart's Quintet for Piano and Winds, K452, in April 1955.
