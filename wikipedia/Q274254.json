Three years later Febvre was elected to the Coll\u00e8ge de France. He moved to Paris, and in doing so, says Fink, became all the more aloof. This placed a strain on Bloch's and his relations, although they communicated regularly by letter and much of their correspondence is preserved. In 1934, Bloch was invited to speak at the London School of Economics. There he met Eileen Power, R. H. Tawney and Michael Postan, among others. While in London, he was asked to write a section of the Cambridge Economic History of Europe; at the same time, he also attempted to foster interest in the Annales among British historians. He later told Febvre in some ways he felt he had a closer affinity with academic life in England than that of France. For example, in comparing the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale with the British Museum, he said that", "1931 saw the publication of Les caract\u00e9res originaux de l'histoire rurale francaise. In this\u2014what Bloch called \"mon petit livre\"\u2014he used both the traditional techniques of historiographical analysis(for example, scrutinising documents, manuscripts, accounts and rolls) and his newer, multi-faceted approach, with a heavy emphasis on maps as evidence. Bloch did not allow his new methods to detract from the former: he knew, says the historian Daniel Chirot, that the traditional methods of research were \"the bread and butter of historical work. One had to do it well to be a minimally accepted historian\". The first of \"two classic works\", says Hughes, and possibly his finest, studies the relationship between physical geographical location and the development of political institutions. Loyn has called Bloch's assessment of medieval French rural law great, but with the addendum that \"he is not so good at describing ordinary human beings. He is no Eileen Power, and his peasants do not come to life as hers do\". In this study, Chirot says Bloch \"entirely abandoned the concept of linear history, and wrote, instead, from the present or near past into the distant past, and back towards the present\". Febvre wrote the introduction to the book for its publication, and described the technique as \"reading the past from the present\", or what Bloch saw as starting with the known and moving into the unknown."]}, {"page": "Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury", "response": ["In 1610\u201311, Salisbury worked hard to persuade Parliament to enact the Great Contract, under which the King would give up all his feudal and customary sources of revenue (wardship and purveyance) in return for a fixed annual income of approximately \u00a3300,000.John Harold Clapham & Eileen Power, Cambridge Economic History of Europe: From the Decline of the Roman Empire, vol. 5 (Cambridge, 1977), p. 382. The rationale was that the King was spending extravagantly, exceeding his income by \u00a3140,000, and putting the kingdom into debt. By 1608, the debt was \u00a31.4 million, although the Lord Treasurer managed to get that down to \u00a3300,000 by 1610.Melissa D. Aaron, Global Economics: A History of the Theater Business, the Chamberlain's/King's Men, and Their Plays, 1599-1642 (Delaware, 2005), p. 83. The project was one to which Salisbury attached great importance, but the House of Commons eventually lost interest in the plan,Ronald H. Fritze & William B. Robison, Historical dictionary of Stuart England, (Westport, 1996), p. 216 and Francis Bacon argued against it, calling it humiliating. King James I also did not show much enthusiasm for it, and it lapsed when the King, against Salisbury's advice, dissolved Parliament in 1611. This was a double blow to Lord Salisbury, who was sick and prematurely aged, and conscious that the King now increasingly preferred the company of his male favourites, like The 1st Earl of Somerset. Although it failed to be implemented, the concept of paying an annual income to the monarch was revived some five decades later as a solution to the nation's financial problems and formed the basis for the financial settlement at the Restoration of Charles II,Kenyon, J.P  The Stuarts Fontana Edition 1966 p.44 through which Charles was to receive an income of approximately \u00a31,200,000 per annum."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Eileen Power (1889\u20131940), Middle Ages"]}, {"page": "1924 in literature", "response": ["*Eileen Power \u2013 Medieval People"]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Eileen Power (1889\u20131940) \u2013 Middle Ages"]}, {"page": "Dora Russell", "response": ["Dora and Russell were married on 25 September 1921 at Battersea Town Hall with Eileen Power and Frank Russell acting as witnesses.
