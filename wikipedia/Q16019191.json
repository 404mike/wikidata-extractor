His small cottage in Cults became the centre for visits from many enthusiasts of Scottish fiddling. He judged many fiddle competitions, and it was at one of these, in the City Hall in Perth, that he met Yehudi Menuhin for the first time. Menuhin was greatly impressed by his playing and his knowledge of the ins and outs of traditional Scottish fiddling and in 1974 they made a television programme (Mr. Menuhin's Welcome to Blair Castle) on Scots Fiddle Music in Blair Castle, where Niel Gow, the doyen of Scots fiddlers, had played regularly 200 years before. Of MacAndrew, Menuhin wrote, \"What he knew could only be learned from people with a great musical tradition, and I have a kind of reverence, almost awe, for someone who represents a tradition as exciting as that. .... ... to me, of course, he was the voice of Scotland. When I met this man and heard him play, I knew I was in the presence of Scottish history.\"   He died six years later on 5 April 1980, following  a stroke, acknowledged by such as Ron Gonnella, Ian Powrie and Willie Hunter as the greatest Scots fiddler of his generation."]}, {"page": "Powrie", "response": ["*Ian Powrie (1923\u20132011), Scottish country dance musician and fiddle player"]}]}}
