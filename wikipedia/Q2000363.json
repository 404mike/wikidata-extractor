That finish was again achieved in 1968, with Queen's winning 20 games (eight in succession towards the end) and scoring 76 goals.

This influence began when former Scotland international Bobby Clark returned to the U.S. after his 1994\u201396 stint as New Zealand head coach to take the head coaching job at Stanford University (he now holds the same position at Notre Dame). Clark began recruiting in New Zealand, and former New Zealand national players Ryan Nelsen and Simon Elliott played for him at Stanford. The trend that Clark started has continued to the present; more than two dozen New Zealanders are now playing for NCAA Division I men's programs in the U.S. A common next step in these players' career paths is a stint in Major League Soccer; ESPN soccernet journalist Brent Latham speculated in a March 2010 story that New Zealand's 2010 FIFA World Cup squad could have more MLS players than the U.S. squad.Latham's piece directly states; \"From his post across the Pacific Ocean, Ricki Herbert may have a more profound interest in labor peace in America [referring to a possible MLS player strike that was averted days after the piece] than anyone in the history of New Zealand, because when his team kicks off the World Cup against Slovakia on 15 June, the All-Whites' lineup could feature even more MLS players than [U.S. national coach Bob] Bradley's.\" However, Latham's speculation did not prove true, as only one MLS player made the New Zealand squad for the World Cup. New Zealand formerly competed against Australia for top honours in the OFC. However, after Australia left to join the AFC in 2006, New Zealand were left as the only seeded team in the OFC. New Zealand qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup though exited the competition after the first round despite being the only team not to lose a game during the tournament. The tournament also featured one of New Zealand's most notable results, a 1\u20131 draw with the then world champions Italy. New Zealand drew their other two pool games with Slovakia and Paraguay and ultimately finished above Italy, who placed last, in the group. New Zealand drew all three games and finished third in their group. New Zealand were also the only undefeated team in the entire tournament thanks to Spain's defeat to Switzerland."]}, {"page": "United Soccer Association", "response": ["|Bobby Clark, Washington "]}, {"page": "San Antonio Thunder", "response": ["*  Bobby Clark (1976)"]}, {"page": "Robert Clark", "response": ["Robert, Bob, or Bobby Clark may refer to:", "*Bobby Clark (juvenile actor) (born 1944), American film and TV actor and stuntman", "*Bobby Clark (comedy actor) (1888\u20131960), vaudevillian, performed on stage, films, television, & the circus", "*Bobby Clark (footballer, born 1945), Scottish footballer", "*Bobby Clark (outfielder) (born 1955), American baseball outfielder", "*Bobby Clark (Australian footballer) (born 1940), Australian rules footballer", "*Bobby Clark (rugby union) (born 1944), Scotland international rugby union player", "*Bobby Clark (tenor) (?\u20132014), original member of the Southern Gospel Cathedral Quartet"]}, {"page": "Stu Riddle", "response": ["At the age of 19, Riddle was the member of Bobby Clark's 1996 New Zealand Olympic Team, where he made four appearances including one as a substitute, in a 1\u20130 victory over then Oceania rivals Australia."]}]}}
