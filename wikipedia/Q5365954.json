He lived briefly in Paris before moving to St Petersburg in 1898 to work in the library of the Imperial Archaeological Commission. Returning to Cambridge in 1901 he began lecturing in Classics.\nIn 1927, he was appointed Disney Professor of Archaeology, a post he held until 1938. He wrote widely with books including Scythians and Greeks (1913) and The Art of the Northern Nomads (1944). He was an authority on Slavonic icons and in 1943 cleared the Russian translation engraved on the ceremonial \"Sword of Stalingrad\" presented by the British people in homage to the defenders of the Russian city.\nIn the 1945 New Year Honours, Minns was appointed a Knight Bachelor, and thereby granted the title sir.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Turkic peoples", "response": ["During the first century CE, Pomponius Mela refers to the Turcae in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the Tyrcae among the people of the same area.Pliny, Natural History \u2013 Harvard University Press, vol.

Providing himself with a broad-based grounding in archaeology, Clark sat in on lectures given by archaeologists like Gertrude Caton Thompson, Dorothy Garrod, Leonard Woolley, and Childe. Although the Cambridge syllabus did not provide opportunities for excavation, Clark assisted the non-professional archaeologist Eliot Curwen during his excavations of the Whitehawk Neolithic causewayed camp near Brighton and then The Trundle, an Iron Age hillfort and Neolithic causewayed enclosure near Chichester. It was at the latter that he befriended two fellow excavators, Stuart Piggott and Charles Philips, who became lifelong friends. He also visited a number of Mortimer Wheeler's excavations, although never worked on them.
