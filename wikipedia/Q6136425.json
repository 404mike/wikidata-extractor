He had a stammer that was said to have affected his job.  The 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1861 and being treated by Dr Hunt a psellismolligist.  Since his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay.His other main interest was in anthropology and in 1863 he established the Anthropological Society of London, which after his death merged with the more established Ethnological Society of London to become the Royal Anthropological Institute.", "link_mentions": {}}}
