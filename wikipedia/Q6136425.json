He had a stammer that was said to have affected his job.  The 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1861 and being treated by Dr Hunt a psellismolligist.  Since his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay.His other main interest was in anthropology and in 1863 he established the Anthropological Society of London, which after his death merged with the more established Ethnological Society of London to become the Royal Anthropological Institute.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthropology", "response": ["Waitz was influential among British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away from the Ethnological Society of London to form the Anthropological Society of London, which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, The Anthropological Review, Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard. Among the first associates were the young Edward Burnett Tylor, inventor of cultural anthropology, and his brother Alfred Tylor, a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist."]}, {"page": "Noble savage", "response": ["In 1860, John Crawfurd and James Hunt linked the \"noble savage\" concept with developing schools of thought regarding scientific racism.See Ellingson (2001), pp. 249\u2013323. Crawfurd, in alliance with Hunt, was elected to the presidency of the Ethnological Society of London, which was an offshoot of the Aborigines' Protection Society, founded with the intent to prevent indigenous peoples from being enslaved or otherwise exploited.History page: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland . The Ethnological Society later merged with the Anthropological Society of London to form the Institute. Invoking \"science\" and \"realism\", the two men derided their \"philanthropic\" predecessors for believing in human equality and for not recognizing that mankind was divided into superior and inferior races. Crawfurd, who opposed Darwinian evolution, \"denied any unity to mankind, insisting on immutable, hereditary, and timeless differences in racial character, principal amongst which was the 'very great' difference in 'intellectual capacity. For Crawfurd, the races had been created separately and were different species. Both Crawfurd and Hunt supported the theory of polygenism, believing in the plurality of the human species. Crawfurd and Hunt routinely accused those who disagreed with them of believing in \"Rousseau's Noble Savage\". Ultimately, however, their partnership fell apart due to Hunt giving a speech in 1865 entitled On the Negro's place in Nature, in which he defended the institution of slavery in the Confederacy during the end of the American Civil War; Crawfurd, being an ardent abolitionist, cut his ties with Hunt after the speeech. \"As Ter Ellingson demonstrates, Crawfurd was responsible for re-introducing the Pre-Rousseauian concept of 'the Noble Savage' to modern anthropology, attributing it wrongly and quite deliberately to Rousseau.\" In an otherwise rather lukewarm review of Ellingson's book in Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History 4:1 (Spring 2003), Frederick E.

The Anthropological Society, Hunt proclaimed, would concern itself with the collection of facts and the identification of natural laws that explained the diversity of humankind.  It would also cast its intellectual nets more broadly, dealing with the physical as well as the cultural aspects of humans.", "According to noted Darwin biographers Adrian Desmond and James Moore, however, founder James Hunt was a paid agent of the Confederate States of America, as was his friend Henry Hotze and two other council members.  Their purpose in founding the society was \"to swing London opinion during the [American Civil] war.\"  Hunt and Hotze put pro-slavery pseudoscience into the Anthropological Society library, \"bought journalists, printed and distributed thousands of pamphlets,... ran a propaganda weekly in Fleet Street, The Index...\" and in general promoted the pro-slavery dogma that black people were a separate species and inherently capable of no higher development than that of enslavement.Darwin's Sacred Cause: How a hatred of slavery shaped Darwin's views on human evolution, A Desmond and J Moore, 2009 Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston/NYC; quotes from p. 332-3", "Efram Sera-Shriar, \u2018Observing Human Difference: James Hunt, Thomas Huxley, and Competing Disciplinary Strategies in the 1860s\u2019, Annals of Science, 70 (2013), 461-491"]}, {"page": "History of anthropology", "response": ["The mixed character of Greek anthropos and Latin -logia marks it as New Latin. There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (logos) has that meaning. James Hunt attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the Anthropological Society of London as president and founder, 1863. He did find an anthropologos from Aristotle in the standard ancient Greek Lexicon, which he says defines the word as \"speaking or treating of man\". This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: \"i.e. fond of personal conversation\". If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name."]}, {"page": "Polygenism", "response": ["Polygenist schools arose in the 1830s and 1840s across Europe.

A colleague of Knox, James Hunt, was also an early author who promoted polygenism in Britain, though he was more concerned with establishing white superiority.
