He has been described as the \"Father of the Royal Air Force.\"\nDuring his formative years, Trenchard struggled academically, failing many examinations and only just succeeding in meeting the minimum standard for commissioned service in the British Army. As a young infantry officer, Trenchard served in India and with the outbreak of the Boer War, he volunteered for service in South Africa. While fighting the Boers, Trenchard was critically wounded and as a result of his injury, he lost a lung, was partially paralysed and returned to Great Britain. On medical advice, Trenchard travelled to Switzerland to recuperate and boredom saw him taking up bobsleighing.  After a heavy crash, Trenchard found that his paralysis was gone and that he could walk unaided. Following further recuperation, Trenchard returned to active service in South Africa.\nAfter the end of the Boer War, Trenchard saw service in Nigeria where he was involved in efforts to bring the interior under settled British rule and quell intertribal violence.  During his time in West Africa, Trenchard commanded the Southern Nigeria Regiment for several years.\nIn Summer 1912, Trenchard learned to fly and gained his aviator's certificate (No. 270) on 31 July flying a Henry Farman biplane of the Sopwith School of Flying at Brooklands. He was subsequently appointed as second in command of the Central Flying School.  He held several senior positions in the Royal Flying Corps during First World War, serving as the commander of the Royal Flying Corps in France from 1915 to 1917.  In 1918, he briefly served as the first Chief of the Air Staff before taking up command of the Independent Air Force in France.  Returning as Chief of the Air Staff under Winston Churchill in 1919, Trenchard spent the following decade securing the future of the Royal Air Force.  He was Metropolitan Police Commissioner in the 1930s and a defender of the RAF in his later years.  Trenchard is recognised today as one of the early advocates of strategic bombing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1956", "response": ["* February 10 \u2013 Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard, British marshal of the Royal Air Force (b. 1873)"]}, {"page": "Taunton", "response": ["*Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard (1873\u20131956), Taunton-born military officer involved in grounding the Royal Air Force"]}, {"page": "Viscount Trenchard", "response": ["thumb|200px|Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard"]}, {"page": "Marshal of the air force", "response": ["|United Kingdom||1927|| 75px ||Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard||Marshal of the Royal Air Force||1873||1956||Promoted 1 January 1927."]}, {"page": "Bristol F.2 Fighter", "response": ["Days prior to Christmas 1916, the first deliveries of production F.2A Fighters were completed, No. 48 Squadron at Rendcomb being the first operational unit of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to receive the type.
