Gigging throughout late 1962 and early 1963, they soon attracted attention for their distinctive sound.", "After changing their name to Manfred Mann at the behest of their label's producer John Burgess, the group signed with His Master's Voice in March 1963 and began their recorded output that July with the slow, blues instrumental single \"Why Should We Not?\", which they performed on their first appearance on television on a New Year's Eve show. It failed to chart, as did its follow-up (with vocals), \"Cock-a-Hoop\". The overdubbed instrumental soloing on woodwinds, vibes, harmonica and second keyboard lent considerable weight to the group's sound, and demonstrated the jazz-inspired technical prowess in which they took pride.", "With the success of \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\" the sound of the group's singles moved away from the jazzy, blues-based music of their early years to a pop hybrid that continued to make hit singles from cover material.

Meanwhile, \"B\" sides and four-song EPs showcased original material and instrumental solos. The group also returned to jazz and R&B themes on their albums: their first, 1964's The Five Faces of Manfred Mann, included standards such as \"Smokestack Lightning\" while the second and last with this line-up, Mann Made, offered several self-composed instrumentals and a version of \"Stormy Monday Blues\" alongside novelties and pop ballads. With a cover of Maxine Brown's \"Oh No Not My Baby\" began a phase of new depth and sophistication in the arrangements of their singles. The group began its string of successes with Bob Dylan songs with a track on the best-selling EP The One in the Middle, \"With God on Our Side\", next reaching No. 2 in the UK with \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\". The EP's title track reached the British top ten singles, the last self-written song (by Jones) and the band's last R'n'B workout to do so.
