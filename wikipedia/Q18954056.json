He was educated locally, at Ryhope Grammar School, and studied English at Oriel College, Oxford. He then studied comparative philology at Merton College, Oxford, and was a Commonwealth Fellow at Harvard University. He served in the British Army during the Second World War, including working in intelligence at Bletchley Park.\nHaving taught at University College, Swansea, before the war, he moved to the University of Oxford after being demobbed. Only two years later, in 1948, he moved to the University of Edinburgh as its first Forbes Professor of English Language and General Linguistics. He remained at Edinburgh until retirement, and then served as director of the Middle English Dialect Atlas Project from 1979 to 1986.

LALME, whose initial stages date to 1952, ushered in the next phase.  Motivated by strong arguments for scribal normalization, historical dialectologists were no longer constrained by the unevenness of scribal fidelity.  Medieval dialect studies would now rely on the relative consistency of scribal translation into a scribe's own language, while developing techniques for discriminating source from scribe.  Angus McIntosh, one of LALME's compilers, \"observed that most copied Middle English texts were...in language that was dialectally homogeneous,\", suggesting scribal conversion of exemplar language into local varieties.  Problematically, though, such varieties might not reflect the geographic areas of composition, since scribes often traveled to copying centers from far afield.  This and other problems arising from the diversity of scribal practices (e.g. literam, or literal, and mischsprache, or mixed-language copying) placed a premium on texts of explicit local provenance to anchor dialectal domains.  Such anchor texts, often correspondence or legal documents, form the basis of LALME's fit-technique.  Michael Benskin, another LALME compiler, describes the fit-technique as a \"mechanical means of discovering whereabouts in the continuum of accents [an] unfamiliar accent belongs.\"  This is done by comparing word forms in texts of uncertain origin against like forms attested in the anchor matrix, a comparison which \"depends on the progressive elimination of the areas to which the individual elements of the accent do not belong.\"  Only frequently attested items of particular dialectal salience are so compared.  In the case of LALME, these items were solicited through text questionnaires later converted into Linguistic Profiles (LPs).  Questionnaires were not deemed practicable in LAEME's case, since the amount of linguistic information desired from comparatively fewer, comparatively fragmentary texts would have made them unwieldy.  Instead, LAEME opted for corpus digitization.", "The above complexities and complications have obliged LAEME's architects to build the atlas around a digitized corpus of lexico-grammatically tagged texts that can be searched and compared according to the research needs of users.  Instead of creating Linguistic Profiles from questionnaire responses, text dictionaries - taxonomical inventories of each text language -  are derived from tagged texts.  Independent searchability multiplies LAEME's usages across disciplines, as scholars and researchers can generate their own Form and Tag Dictionaries, Feature Maps, and Concordances.  LAEME surpasses its remit as a dialect resource by offering a suite of multi-function linguistic tools for public use.  This versatility accords with Angus McIntosh's progressive vision for LALME, which he saw as \"more likely to benefit those concerned with the literature and culture and social structure of medieval England than those primarily concerned with...linguistics.\""]}, {"page": "Linguistic Survey of Scotland", "response": ["The Survey began at a time when the modern subject of linguistics was evolving and the leaders accepted that the Survey would need to change over time to stay relevant to on-going linguistic work.Petyt (1980), page 95  The original intentions of the Survey were set out by Professor Angus McIntosh in the book Introduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects.
