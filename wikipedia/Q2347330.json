During his time with Forest he made 257 appearances across all competitions, and won the League Cup and Full Members' Cup twice each. After retiring from playing, Sutton moved into coaching.

He started the 1988\u201389 season as fourth choice but Hans Segers and Paul Crichton were transferred in quick succession to Wimbledon F.C. and Peterborough United respectively, and when Steve Sutton fell ill, Crossley found himself thrust into the first team, playing in league wins over Liverpool and Newcastle United and a League Cup win over Coventry City before Sutton's return. He had a loan spell at Manchester United during the 1989\u201390 season but was never selected for the first team, although he played three times for the reserves. He had two spells in Forest's team, firstly when Sutton was injured and later when Sutton suffered a loss of form.", "He was a huge favourite with the fans, despite being prone to occasional mistakes, and made over 300 appearances in thirteen years with the club, becoming first-choice 'keeper at the start of the 1990\u201391 season. This was strengthened by Steve Sutton's move to Derby County in 1992. Crossley played in the 1991 FA Cup Final loss to Tottenham Hotspur. He missed a run of games including the Full Members Cup and Football League Cup finals against Southampton and Manchester United respectively due to a breach of club rules. Andrew Marriott wore the gloves in his place, although Crossley regained his place for the next league game after the second final.

His early career was with home-town club PSV Eindhoven, before being signed for Nottingham Forest by Brian Clough during the 1983\u201384 season.

He made 18 appearances in 1986\u201387 and signed for Stoke City on loan in March 1987 playing in one Second Division match for the \"Potters\", a 4\u20131 defeat away at West Bromwich Albion. He played 5 games in 1987\u201388 but was clearly second choice despite he and Sutton being of similar ability.

The move was followed three days later by Forest winger Kris Commons moving to Pride Park, though he was released by Forest first meaning he did not move directly between the two clubs.

(1970\u2013present)", "response": ["Following a shaky start to the 1991\u20131992 season, Pleat took a gamble and re signed Mick Harford, who joined Luton for a second spell as a player for \u00a3325,000 in mid-September 1991. Brian Stein had already returned from FC Annecy for a second spell and Pleat had revived the forward line which had played a big part in Luton's success a few years earlier. Stein scored only three goals in 39 league appearances over the course of the season, but Harford proved to be a success once again as he ended the season as the club's top scorer for the season with 12 goals. The loan signing of goalkeeper Steve Sutton from Nottingham Forest revived Luton for a period, but the Board refused to supply the \u00a3300,000 fee required to keep Sutton permanently. Various loan signings such as veteran forward Imre Varadi failed to galvanise the side, but come the last day, Luton still had an outside chance of avoiding relegation, having won 10 league games at home but failed to win any of their away fixtures. Luton travelled to already-relegated Notts County knowing that they had to win their first away match of the season, and hope that Coventry lost at Aston Villa. Julian James gave Luton the lead they required, but two late goals from Rob Matthews saw County drag Luton down with them. Almost 30 years on, they have still yet to return to the top flight and have rarely looked like achieving it. This meant the club missed out on competing in the inaugural season of the Premier League and, with it, the larger amounts of money available through television rights."]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["Two months then followed without a win, as Dave Beaumont left for Hibernian and new signing Steve Thompson left after only seven matches in a swap deal with Leicester City for Des Linton and Scott Oakes. Talented full back Matt Jackson also moved on, to sign for Everton. Form was no better in the cups, as Luton were knocked out of both the League Cup and the Full Members' Cup in October. The acquisition of goalkeeper Steve Sutton in November raised spirits, though Luton's next victory did not come until 20 December, when a Harford goal sealed a 1\u20130 win over Coventry. The next two matches were at home, and Luton won them both \u2013 another goal from Harford secured a defeat of Arsenal on Boxing Day, and Chelsea were beaten 2\u20130 two days later.
