The major work was completed in late 2006 with the opening of branches of several high street chain stores and restaurants.  The dual management has caused problems though, as the landlord restored the structure of the estate but the council is responsible for maintenance of the residential properties \u2013 so while the concrete structure was restored, the windows remained untouched, detracting from the overall aesthetic of the development.  In 2007, the council started work on replacing the windows."]}, {"page": "Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University", "response": ["| Susanna Heron || Henslow\u2019s Walk"]}, {"page": "Heron (surname)", "response": ["*Susanna Heron (born 1949), British artist who works primarily between drawing, sculpture, scale and movement"]}, {"page": "List of people from Welwyn Garden City", "response": ["* Susanna Heron (born 1949), stone relief sculptor"]}]}}
