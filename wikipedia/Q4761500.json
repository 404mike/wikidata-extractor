A wicketkeeper, he played with Gloucestershire between 1936 and 1955.\nHe started his career at Middlesex in 1932 where he originally played as a lower order batsman. With him unable to cement his spot in the side he moved to Gloucestershire in 1935 and became their first choice keeper a couple of years later after he had qualified for residence. He scored 1138 runs in his debut season which included 130 against Middlesex at Lord's.\nAfter fighting in World War 2 he returned to the county in 1946 where he began opening the batting. He took 30 stumpings in 1947 and made his highest score of 188 against Sussex at Priory Park, Chichester in 1949. For every season until 1950 he passed 1000 runs, last achieving the feat in 1953. He coached Gloucestershire from 1950 and in a match against Hampshire in 1953 he took a record 10 catches, 6 of them in the first innings.\nAfter retiring from cricket he became a sports journalist, working for a number of newspapers, and also worked for the National Farmers' Union.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Wilson", "response": ["Andrew or Andy Wilson may refer to:", "*Andy Wilson (director) (born 1958), British film, TV and theatre director", "*Andy Wilson (cyclist) (1902\u20131926), British Olympic cyclist", "*Andy Wilson (cricketer) (1910\u20132002), English first class cricketer", "*Andy Wilson (English footballer) (born 1940), English footballer", "*Andy Wilson (Australian rules footballer) (born 1951), former Australian rules footballer", "*Andy Wilson (wrestler) (1916\u20131979), British Olympic wrestler"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Gloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was waiting in the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.Playfair, pp. 85\u201387.", "* 31 \u2013 Andy Wilson (Gloucestershire; 29 matches; 32 ct)", "* 63 \u2013 Andy Wilson (Gloucestershire)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["* Andrew and Andy Wilson (disambiguation), one of the following", "*** Andy Wilson (cyclist) (1902\u20131926), British Olympic cyclist", "*** Andy Wilson (cricketer) (1910\u20132002), English first class cricketer", "*** Andy Wilson (English footballer) (born 1940), English footballer", "*** Andy Wilson (Australian rules footballer) (born 1951), Australian rules footballer", "*** Andy Wilson (director) (born 1958), British film, TV and theatre director"]}, {"page": "West of England cricket team", "response": ["* Andy Wilson (1948)"]}, {"page": "Peter Rochford", "response": ["A right-handed tail-end batsman and wicketkeeper, Rochford played for Yorkshire's second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship in 1951 before joining Gloucestershire for 1952. Unable to displace regular wicketkeeper Andy Wilson, who was a far better batsman, he played just two first-class games in 1952 and one in 1953, and made only eight appearances in 1954, when Wilson was 44. In 1955, however, Rochford took over as the regular wicketkeeper, playing in 30 matches and making 60 dismissals, and being awarded his county cap. His batting did not develop, however, and his highest score of the season was just 16 not out. There were a few signs of batting improvement in 1956 when, with 31 not out against Oxford University, Rochford made his highest score, and with Bryan Wells, Sam Cook and Francis McHugh in Gloucestershire's side, Rochford often batted far higher in the order than his batting talent warranted. He again made 60 dismissals in the season. After a few matches in 1957, he lost his place and with both Bobby Etheridge and Barrie Meyer available, he left the Gloucestershire staff at the end of the season. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1993 indicates that there was friction between Rochford and the Gloucestershire committee."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Andy Wilson (1936\u20131955) : A.
