A second attempt on K2 in 1980 saw Tasker almost wiped out by an avalanche and was ultimately unsuccessful. In the winter of 1980-1981 Tasker was part of an eight-man team (with Alan Rouse, John Porter, Brian Hall, Adrian Burgess, Alan Burgess, Pete Thexton and Paul Nunn) attempting to make a difficult winter assault on the West Face of Mount Everest; this was unsuccessful but was recounted in Tasker's first book Everest the Cruel Way.", "In 1980, Tasker met Maria Coffey, the girlfriend who wrote about her grief following his death in Fragile Edge. In 1981, he was part of the British team which made the first ascent of Kongur Tagh (7,649 m) in China, accompanied by Chris Bonington, Peter Boardman and Alan Rouse. He disappeared with Boardman on 17 May 1982 on the North-East Ridge of Everest. The body of Boardman was found in 1992, resting in a sitting position just past the second pinnacle in the extremely difficult area of the \"Three Pinnacles\" on the middle North-East Ridge of Everest, but the body of Tasker is still missing, although some of his climbing equipment was found between the second and third pinnacles."]}, {"page": "Al Rouse", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Rouse"]}, {"page": "Liliane and Maurice Barrard", "response": ["The start to the Barrards' K2 expedition was not a promising one: Maurice and Liliane \"had left their entire expedition budget -- thousands of dollars plus airline tickets and passports on the backseat of a taxi!\"Curran, Jim, K2: Triumph and Tragedy. p.32.

Grafton, 1989. ()", "* During the 'Black Summer', many expeditions shared in a surfeit of tragedies.  An American expedition to the South-South-West Ridge suffered two casualties --John Smolich and Alan Pennington were killed in an avalanche on June 21, after which their teammates left the mountain.  Maurice and Liliane Barrard were lost on their descent after a successful summit bid, on June 25.  A Polish climber, Tadeusz Piotrowski, fell to his death after a successful summit of the Central Rib of the South Face, on July 10.  On July 16, Renato Casarotto fell into a crevasse, after an unsuccessful attempt at climbing the South-South-West Ridge, and died later that day after being pulled out.  Wojciech Wroz, a Polish climber, died during his descent on August 3-4, after a successful ascent of the South-South-West Ridge.  On August 4, Mohammed Ali (Sirdar, or leader, of a South Korean expedition's high-altitude porters) was killed by stonefall on the Abruzzi Ridge.  British climber Julie Tullis died after a successful summit attempt and forced descent to Camp Four, possibly from High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) on August 7.  Two Austrian climbers, Alfred Imitzer and Hannes Wieser, died in a descent from Camp Four during a storm on August 10. British climber Alan Rouse is presumed to have died the same day; as was Dobroslawa Miodowicz-Wolf, a Polish climber who disappeared on fixed ropes below Camp Three. Difficult weather conditions caused many other injuries and near-fatalities throughout the summer.Curran, Jim, K2: Triumph and Tragedy. p.187-88.  Grafton, 1989. ()"]}]}}
