Prior to the start of World War II in 1939, Porter made 32 appearances for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship.

The Minor Counties won the toss and elected to bat first, making 195 all out, with Porter being dismissed for 38 runs by Jahangir Khan. Cambridge University then made 163 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by making 144 all out, with Porter being dismissed for 4 runs by James Grimshaw.
