He also led his new club to their biggest ever defeat against their bitter cross-city rivals Linfield in a 6\u20130 defeat at Windsor Park. The Glens have sought to reduce the gap between them and Linfield by signing Kyle Neill and Gary Hamilton from Portadown and re-signing former fan's favourite Gary Smyth.
