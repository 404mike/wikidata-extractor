He is the youngest and third son of Odin and Frigga. His brothers are Loki and Thor. Baldur is one of the few gods in the world that cares about mortals. Baldur and Hercules each had exactly the same dream at the same time, in which Baldur asks Hercules to help him just before he dies. Hercules travels to the Norseland after the dream, and meets Baldur. After Baldur is killed, Hercules must find out who did it and why.
