At 9:10 am on Friday 17 July 2015, a number of people were injured, four killed or missing, and the mill destroyed, by at least three explosions at the Wood Treatment site. The local Member of Parliament (MP), David Rutley, spent time at the site. He said it was \"like a war zone\" and described the day as his \"darkest day\" so far in his time as MP. The following Sunday the Methodist minister (Rev. Pam Butler) and Vicar (Rev. John Harries) held a joint service of remembrance. It was in the Anglican church because the Methodist church was inside the cordon set up to protect the site. On the Friday they had both expressed publicly the trauma and anger felt by the whole village. A fund for the victims was set up by a local councillor.Macclesfield Express, 22 July 2015, pp. 1\u20137 By 23 July, three of the four bodies had been recovered, and the fire chief was \u201cvery confident\u201d that they knew the location of the last one. Fires were still burning and very little of the structure was identifiable. Paul Hitchen, of the Urban Search and Rescue team, said, \"The scale of the incident...is unprecedented in this country in the last 10 years.\" Firefighters finally left the scene over a month after the tragedy. Even then the Urban Search and Rescue Team from Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service remained to continue looking for the body of the one person who was, officially, still only missing.Macclesfield Express, 26 August 2015, p.9"]}, {"page": "Treasury Select Committee", "response": ["| David Rutley MP (Conservative)"]}, {"page": "Cheshire East", "response": ["| David Rutley", "| colspan = 7 | David Rutley"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**David Rutley", "**David Rutley", "** David Rutley", "** David Rutley", "** David Rutley", "** David Rutley", "** David Rutley", "** David Rutley"]}, {"page": "March 7", "response": ["*1961 \u2013 David Rutley, English businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "British Government frontbench", "response": ["| colspan=\"2\" | David Rutley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2010 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Macclesfield||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Conservative||style=\"background-color: \"| ||David Rutley\u00a0(C)||Seat held.
