Their current lineup consists of lead and rhythm guitarist Mick Box, keyboardist Phil Lanzon, lead vocalist Bernie Shaw, drummer Russell Gilbrook, and bassist Dave Rimmer. They have experienced numerous lineup changes throughout their -year career, leaving Box as the only remaining original member. Notable former members of the band are vocalists David Byron, John Lawton, John Sloman, Peter Goalby, and Steff Fontaine, bassists Gary Thain, Trevor Bolder, John Wetton, Bob Daisley, Paul Newton, and John Jowitt, drummers Nigel Olsson, Lee Kerslake and Chris Slade, and keyboardists Ken Hensley and John Sinclair.", "Their 1970 debut album, \u2026Very 'Eavy \u2026Very 'Umble (released as Uriah Heep in the United States), introduced Hensley's heavy organ and the band's guitar-driven sound, with David Byron's theatrical, dynamic vocals soaring above thunderous sonic backgrounds, although acoustic and jazz elements also featured in the mix. The album's title references the signature phrase of the Dickens character (\"very 'umble\"). Hensley had little to contribute to the debut: Box and Byron wrote most of the material, including \"Gypsy\", in many ways (according to Blows) \"...a marriage of contrasts\" that, in time, became their trademark. In a 1989 interview, Mick Box recalled, \"The funny thing was we wrote it at the Hanwell Community Centre, and Deep Purple were rehearsing in the room next door to us. You can imagine the kind of racket we were both making between us.\" During the winter of 1970, three-quarters into the recording of the album, drummer Alex Napier was replaced by Nigel Olsson, recommended to Byron by Elton John. The debut was not popular with rock critics (especially in the US, where Rolling Stone reviewer Melissa Mills infamously promised to commit suicide \"if this band makes it\"). In the course of the album's making the writing relationship between Box, Byron and Hensley was beginning to develop. \"It was very quick, because we were all into the same things. It was like it was meant to be, there was that kind of chemistry,\" Mick Box recalled.", "thumb|right|Lee Kerslake, David Byron, Gary Thain, Mick Box and Ken Hensley, 1973", "===Post-David Byron period (1977\u20131981)===", "Firefly was released in February 1977, displaying \"renewed effervescence and energy in unveiling what was clearly a new beginning for Heep\" (per. K. Blows), \"a new vigour and confidence\" (according to a Record Mirror review) and also the new singer's abilities: the latter (according to AllMusic), although lacking the multi-octave range of David Byron, \"\u2026boasted an impressive and emotionally rich hard rock voice that instantly jelled with the Uriah Heep sound.\" The band then toured the US supporting Kiss. Paul Stanley later recalled, \"They were incredibly professional, and so consistent that their worst nights were excellent and their best were tremendous.\"", "A meeting at the manager's office concerning the songwriting dissent was the last straw and, in September 1980, Hensley quit. Gregg Dechert, a Canadian who had worked with Sloman in Pulsar, came in and the band went on a 23-date tour of the UK. After that Sloman left, citing musical differences for a reason. He would later go on to work with UFO, Gary Moore and Robert Palmer. Hensley's acrimonious departure left the group in a state of collapse. Box and Bolder visited David Byron with attractive propositions. \"We couldn't believe it when he said he didn't want to know,\" the guitarist remembered. Bolder, who by that time, \"...had had enough of Gerry Bron and the management,\" decided to join Wishbone Ash. When Dechert left, Uriah Heep were down to just Mick Box with the name and contract.", "By this time Gerry Bron was Uriah Heep manager no longer (they were looked after by Neil Warnock in Europe and Blue Oyster Cult's management team in the US) and then, finally, Bronze Records collapsed under the weight of debts, which, according to Box, \"...cost Heep a lot of money.\" Massive Asian and South American tours followed before the band returned to the studio with producer Tony Platt and a new deal with CBS's Portrait label secured by new manager Harry Maloney. Meanwhile, David Byron died of a heart attack and liver disease on 28 February 1985 at the age of 38.", "Uriah Heep's music has predominantly been described by critics and journalists as progressive rock and heavy metal, with influences from acid rock, blues, and folk. Uriah Heep's distinctive features have always included a massive keyboard sound, strong vocal harmonies and (in the early years) David Byron's quasi-operatic vocals. In a 2018 interview, guitarist Mick Box cited \"five-part vocal harmonies, Hammond organ and wah-wah guitar\" as the main elements of the band's sound."]}, {"page": "1991 in film", "response": ["| Class Action || 20th Century Fox || Michael Apted (director); Carolyn Shelby, Christopher Ames, Samantha Shad (screenplay); Gene Hackman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Colin Friels, Joanna Merlin, Larry Fishburne, Donald Moffat, Jan Rube\u0161, Matt Clark, Fred Dalton Thompson, Jonathan Silverman, Joan McMurtrey, Anne Ramsay, David Byron, Tim Hopper, Robert David Hall || Courtroom drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Ken Hensley", "response": ["Paul Newton asked Hensley (Christmas 1969) to join forces in Spice, as they were looking for a keyboard player to make their sound less bluesy and more progressive, in keeping with the current trend.
