Dodge clashes with Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and begins bullying her, after she continually picks on him simply because she finds him \"creepy\" (and not because he stole candy from her at the bus stop). He then leads Steven into bad behaviour. Things start to get undone when Dodge drunkenly confesses to Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson) that he burned the store down. Steven is enraged when he finds out and attacks Dodge but Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) stops him. Dodge is arrested, charged with murder, and imprisoned for 5 to 6 years. Dodge is paroled in 1995, murders Irene's husband \"mud\" (Murdoch Roberts), and returns Summer Bay to even the score with Steven by framing him for murder. In the end, he kidnaps Kelly Watson (Katrina Hobbs) to lure Steven into a fight with him on a clifftop and plunge into the sea below. Shane Parrish (Dieter Brummer) rescues Steven, but Dodge's body was never found.", "|11 May||Peter Braithwaite|| Ron Blanchard|| Peter is an insurance assessor who contacts Celia Stewart (Fiona Spence) about a claim following the recent fire of her store.
