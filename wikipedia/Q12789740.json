He served in Parliament from 1807 to 7 March 1808, and again from 10 May 1808 to July 1812.\nCochrane was the seventh surviving son of Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald and his second wife Jane Stuart. As a younger son, he sought his fortune in the army; he was an ensign in 1783, a lieutenant in 1787, a captain in 1793, and a major and a lieutenant colonel in 1799. Cochrane resigned in 1805.\nIn 1807 Cochrane and his brother Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone were elected to Parliament from the rotten borough of Grampound with the assistance of their brother Basil's fortune.  He was unseated the next year for lack of due property qualification, but re-elected the same year and seated after a disputed election. He initially voted with the radical opposition, following the line of his nephew Admiral Thomas Cochrane, but after 1810 he supported the Tory ministry of Spencer Perceval. He resigned in 1812 in favor of his brother Andrew.\nHis life after Parliament is unclear; he was still alive in 1832.", "link_mentions": []}}
