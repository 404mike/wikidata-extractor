Bhaskar argued that the task of science is \"the production of the knowledge of those enduring and continually active mechanisms of nature that produce the phenomena of the world\" rather than the discovery of quantitative laws, and that experimental science only makes sense if such mechanisms exist and operate outside the lab as well as inside it. He went on to apply this realism about mechanisms and causal powers to the philosophy of social science, and also elaborated a series of arguments to support the critical role of philosophy and the human sciences.According to Bhaskar, it is possible and desirable for sociology to be scientific.\nHe was a World Scholar at the Institute of Education, University College London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 19", "response": ["*2014 \u2013 Roy Bhaskar, English philosopher and academic (b. 1944)"]}, {"page": "Ontology", "response": ["* Roy Bhaskar"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Roy Bhaskar"]}, {"page": "Structure and agency", "response": ["A recent development in the debate is the critical realist structure/agency perspective embodied in Roy Bhaskar's transformational model of social action (TMSA) which he later expanded into his concept of four-planar social being.

The TMSA has been further advocated and applied in other social science fields by additional authors, for example in economics by Tony Lawson and in sociology by Margaret Archer.

It combines a general philosophy of science (transcendental realism) with a philosophy of social science (critical naturalism). It specifically opposes forms of empiricism and positivism by viewing science as concerned with identifying causal mechanisms. Also, in the context of social science it argues that scientific investigation can lead directly to critique of social arrangements and institutions, in a similar manner to the work of Karl Marx. In the last decades of the twentieth century it also stood against various forms of 'postmodernism'. It is one of a range of types of philosophical realism, as well as forms of realism advocated within social science such as analytic realismAltheide, D. L., and Johnson, J. M.(1994).

Discussions over the primacy of structure or agency relate to the very core of social ontology (\"What is the social world made of?\", \"What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?\"). One attempt to reconcile postmodern critiques with the overarching project of social science has been the development, particularly in Britain, of critical realism. For critical realists such as Roy Bhaskar, traditional positivism commits an 'epistemic fallacy' by failing to address the ontological conditions which make science possible: that is, structure and agency itself."]}, {"page": "World Peace Congress", "response": ["The World Peace Congress, founded by Professor Rajani Kannepalli Kanth in 2007, is a non-governmental organization dedicated to constructing an institutional basis for world peace, unmediated by state, government or politics.

These dialogues produced resolutions adopted initially at the first Congress in Salt Lake City, to ultimately achieve the goal of the Congress - to renounce war as a means of social and political policy. Later on, the World Peace Congress asked the United Nations to declare war as illegal by sending the Renunciation of War Resolution, resolutions adopted at the third World Peace Thai Congress in 2010, to UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, requesting him to ask all Heads of States of the UN to adopt the resolutions by suitably amending their individual Constitutions, or by enacting a special law by their legislatures.

Instead, he wishes to address the \"structural element\" of capitalism, drawing on the critical realist philosophy of Roy Bhaskar, who suggests that \"invisible structures\", like capitalism and language, shape society but can themselves be changed by human activity.

Every step in the analysis can be logically and empirically tested.Cf. Herbert Marcuse: \"The transcendence leading from facts to essence is historical. Through it, given facts are understood as appearances whose essence can be comprehended only in the context of particular historical tendencies aiming at a different form of reality\". Negations. Essays in Critical Theory. London: MayFlyBooks, 2009, p. 53. The hermeneutic assumption is that these relations require shared meanings in order to be able to function and communicate at all. These shared presuppositions have an intrinsic rationality, because human behaviour \u2013 ultimately driven by the need to survive \u2013 is to a large extent purposive (teleological), and not arbitrary or random (though some of it may be). If the \"essential relationships\" never became visible or manifest in any way, no science would be possible at all, only speculative metaphysics. It is merely that sense data require correct interpretation \u2013 they do not have a meaning independently of their socially mediated interpretation. In that sense, the mask presupposes the existence of something which for the time being remains invisible, but which can be revealed when one discovers what is behind the mask. It may be that the essence suddenly reveals itself on the stage of history, or more simply that the understandings which one already has, are altered so that the essence of the thing is finally grasped."]}]}}
