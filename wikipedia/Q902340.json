He discovered mercury fulminate, a powerful primary explosive. In 1813 he invented a method of refining sugar which involved boiling the cane juice not in an open kettle, but in a closed vessel heated by steam and held under partial vacuum. At reduced pressure, water boils at a lower temperature, and so Howard's development both saved fuel and reduced the amount of sugar lost through caramelisation.  The invention, known as Howard's vacuum pan, is still in use.\nHoward also was interested in the composition of meteorites especially those of \"natural iron\".  He found that many of these contained an alloy of nickel and iron that was not found on Earth, and thus might have fallen from the sky.  One type of meteorite is now known as Howardite.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1816", "response": ["* September 27 \u2013 Edward Charles Howard, English chemist, chemical engineer (b. 1774)"]}, {"page": "Mercury(II) fulminate", "response": ["Mercury(II) fulminate is prepared by dissolving mercury in nitric acid and adding ethanol to the solution.

The rudimentary percussion system was invented by Forsyth as a solution to the problem that birds would startle when smoke puffed from the powder pan of his flintlock shotgun, giving them sufficient warning to escape the shot. This early percussion lock system operated in a nearly identical fashion to flintlock firearms and used a fulminating primer made of fulminate of mercury, chlorate of potash, sulphur and charcoal, ignited by concussion.Percussion lockSamuel Parkes, The chemical catechism : with notes, illustrations, and experiments, New York : Collins and Co., 1818, page 494 (page 494 online, see \u201cLVI. A New Kind of Gunpowder.\u201d) His invention of a fulminate-primed firing mechanism deprived the birds of their early warning system, both by avoiding the initial puff of smoke from the flintlock powder pan, as well as shortening the interval between the trigger pull and the shot leaving the muzzle. Forsyth patented his \"scent bottle\" ignition system in 1807. However, it was not until after Forsyth's patents expired that the conventional percussion cap system was developed. Joseph Manton invented a precursor to the percussion cap in 1814, comprising a copper tube that detonated when crushed. This was further developed in 1822 by the English-born American artist Joshua Shaw, as a copper cup filled with fulminates."]}, {"page": "Cartridge (firearms)", "response": ["After Edward Charles Howard discovered fulminates in 1800Howard, Edward (1800)  \"On a New Fulminating Mercury,\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 90 (1): 204\u2013238.Edward Charles Howard at National Portrait Gallery and the patent by Reverend Alexander John Forsyth expired in 1807, Joseph Manton invented the precursor percussion cap in 1814, which was further developed in 1822 by the English-born American artist Joshua Shaw, and caplock fowling pieces appeared in Regency era England.  These guns used a spring-loaded hammer to strike a percussion cap placed over a conical nipple, which served as both an \"anvil\" against the hammer strike and a transfer port for the sparks created by impactfully crushing the cap, and was easier and quicker to load, more resilient to weather conditions, and more reliable than the preceding flintlocks."]}, {"page": "Chemical engineer", "response": ["The president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers said in his presidential address \"I believe most of us would be willing to regard Edward Charles Howard (1774\u20131816) as the first chemical engineer of any eminence\".Transactions of the IChemE (1951) Volume 29 page 163  Others have suggested Johann Rudolf Glauber (1604\u20131670) for his development of processes for the manufacture of the major industrial acids.Herman Skolnik in W.
