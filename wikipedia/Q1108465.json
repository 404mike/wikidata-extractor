During the 1960s, he was one of several Number Twos in the groundbreaking and critically acclaimed TV series The Prisoner. Along with Colin Gordon, McKern was one of only two actors to play Number Two more than once. He first played the character in the episodes \"The Chimes of Big Ben\" and \"Once Upon a Time\", and later reprised the role in the final episode, \"Fall Out\". The filming of \"Once Upon a Time\" proved to be a particularly intense experience for McKern; according to one biographer, the stress caused him to suffer either a nervous breakdown or a heart attack (accounts differ), forcing production to stop for a time. In 1976 McKern narrated and presented The Battle of the Somme, a British Broadcasting Corporation documentary produced to mark the 60th anniversary of World War I battle.'Battle of the Somme' television documentary, BBC (1976), British Film Institute catalogue (2020). https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6f275c56 He played the Earl of Gloucester in the Granada Television production of King Lear (1983) with Sir Laurence Olivier.

However, the evidence above would appear to disprove this. This gives rise to the interesting possibility that this Number Two actually knew Number Six outside of The Village in his former career, and might explain why this Number Two was then given a second chance.
