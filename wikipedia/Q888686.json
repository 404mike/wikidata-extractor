Yet their greatest accomplishment was in reaching the final of the FA Cup, with Banks conceding only five goals in their nine games en route to the final, and keeping three clean sheets in the semi-final and two replays against Sheffield United. Goals from Jimmy Walsh and Ken Leek finally broke the deadlock in the second replay at St Andrew's. Their opponents in the final at Wembley were Tottenham, who had already won the First Division title by an eight-point margin. Right-back Len Chalmers picked up a severe injury early in the match, and with Ken Leek dropped for disciplinary reasons in favour of rookie Hughie McIlmoyle, City were effectively playing with ten men and offered little threat going forward. Bobby Smith and Terry Dyson gave Spurs a 2\u20130 win and the first \"double\" of the 20th century, with Banks unable to prevent either goal."]}, {"page": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.", "response": ["*  Bobby Smith"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Greaves", "response": ["Manager Bill Nicholson and his assistant Eddie Baily then began a period of transition at White Hart Lane\u00a0\u2013 Danny Blanchflower aged 38 retired in 1964 and John White was killed by a lightning strike.

He scored four of his goals in one match against Sunderland, and also scored hat-tricks against Burnley and Leicester City. His nine goals in cup competitions, including a hat-trick against Exeter City, left him with an overall goal tally of 36 in 52 games. His goals for the season took him past Bobby Smith as Spurs' top goalscorer as well as surpassing Steve Bloomer as the First Division's top goalscorer with 336 goals. Spurs performed inconsistently in the 1969\u201370 season, and Greaves was dropped from the first team after playing in an FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 28 January 1970. He was never recalled to the starting line-up, but still ended the season as the club's joint top scorer (with Martin Chivers), having scored 11 goals in 33 matches, taking his total to 266 goals, a club record, including 15 hat-tricks, another club record. Greaves was given a testimonial match by Spurs on 17 October 1972 in a 2\u20131 win over Feyenoord at White Hart Lane attended by over 45,000 people."]}, {"page": "Robert Smith", "response": ["* Bobby Smith (rhythm and blues singer) (1936\u20132013), lead singer of the (Detroit) Spinners", "*Bobby Smith (safety) (born 1938), American football defensive back", "*Bobby Smith (running back) (born 1942), American football running back", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1870), played one game for Stoke", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1900s), Scottish footballer", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1933) (1933\u20132010), English footballer for Tottenham Hotspur", "* Bobby Smith (Irish footballer) (1922\u20131992), football player for Bohemians", "* Bobby Smith (Canadian soccer) (born 1940), Canadian soccer player", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1941) (1941\u20132019), English footballer for Barnsley F.C. and Chelmsford City F.C.", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1944), English footballer and manager", "* Bobby Smith (American soccer) (born 1951), American soccer player", "* Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1953), for Hibernian and Leicester City", "*Bobby Smith (baseball) (1934\u20132015), MLB outfielder, 1957\u20131965", "*Bobby Smith (basketball) (1937\u20132020), American basketball player", "* Bobby Smith (ice hockey) (born 1958), all-star NHL hockey player", "* Bobby Smith (javelin thrower) (born 1982), American javelin thrower", "* Bobby Smith (activist) (born 1982), political and fathers' rights activist"]}, {"page": "Football records and statistics in England", "response": ["|  Bobby Smith  "]}]}}
