The scores were level seven minutes later: a deep cross from Greg Downs was headed on by Keith Houchen to Dave Bennett who rounded Ray Clemence and struck the ball past Steve Hodge into the corner of the Tottenham goal.  Coventry's Cyrille Regis had a goal disallowed and then, five minutes before half-time, Tottenham restored their one-goal lead.  A free kick from Waddle was touched on by Gary Mabbutt and bounced into the far corner of the Coventry goal.  Midway through the second half, Coventry were level once again, with Houchen converting a Bennett cross with a diving header, which would later be selected as the BBC Goal of the Season.  With the game even at full time, extra time was needed to decide the match.

Coventry striker Dave Bennett then made a run towards the Everton goal after Peter Reid had given the ball away, but the attack ended when Nick Pickering was given offside. Speedie received headed a pass from Greg Downs towards Mimms, but was also offside. Ten minutes into the game, Harper sent a free kick deep into Coventry's penalty area which was caught by Ogrizovic. He immediately sent the ball down the field towards Speedie, but Everton's Dave Watson was able to clear the danger. Ogrizovic initiated a similar attack minutes later, when his up-field clearance was laid off by Speedie to Micky Gynn. Gynn ran towards Everton's goal and was brought down by a defender.

Both sides continued to attack, with Sharp hitting a shot which was too weak, and Pickering then kicking wide of the goal.
