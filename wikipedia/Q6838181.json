His second memoir, Thin White Line, was published in 2008.  It is a sequel to events in 1997, and describes alpine ascents in Patagonia, Norway and Alaska. His books have been translated into Italian and German. Reviews in major newspapers led to appearances on TV and radio, as well as invitations to lecture at the Edinburgh International Book Festival.
