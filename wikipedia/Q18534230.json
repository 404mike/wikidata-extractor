With the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Mrs Ventris lost her private income, and in 1940 Dora's father died. Ventris lost his mother to clinical depression and an overdose of barbiturates. He never spoke of her, assuming instead an ebullient and energetic manner in whatever he decided to do, a trait which won him numerous friends. A friend of the family, Russian sculptor Naum Gabo, took Ventris under his wing. Ventris later said that Gabo was the most family he had ever had. It may have been at Gabo's house that he began the study of Russian.  He decided on architecture as a career, and enrolled in the Architectural Association School of Architecture. There he met his wife-to-be Lois Knox-Niven, daughter of Lois Butler. Her social background was similar to Ventris's: her family was well-to-do, she had travelled in Europe, and she was interested in architecture. She was also popular and very beautiful."]}, {"page": "Havergal College", "response": ["*Lois Butler 1913 - Olympic skier, aviator and one of the first women pilots of the Air Transport Auxiliary."]}, {"page": "Canada at the 1936 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|Lois Butler"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1950", "response": ["|The Boy from Indiana || John Rawlins || Lon McCallister, Lois Butler, Billie Burke || Sports || Eagle-Lion"]}, {"page": "Pauline Gower", "response": ["Gower was appointed as the head of the women's branch, and commenced the selection and testing of women pilots, the first eight being appointed by the ATA on 1 January 1940.
