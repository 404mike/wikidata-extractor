His father was Member of Parliament (MP) for Bridgnorth from 1806 to 1831. Whitmore was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. He was a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Shropshire.\n  He served as cornet in the South Salopian Yeomanry Cavalry in 1845.At the 1852 general election, Whitmore was elected MP for Bridgnorth in succession to his brother Thomas Charlton Whitmore. A petition was lodged against his election, but ultimately dismissed. He was Lord of the Treasury and keeper of the Privy Seal to the Prince of Wales from March 1858 to June 1859. Whitmore served as the Conservative party whip for many years until 1869.In 1865 Whitmore lost the seat in the election to John Dahlberg Acton (who became Lord Acton in 1869), but successfully petitioned and had the result overturned. The reinstated Whitmore was a Lord of the Treasury from July 1866 to December 1868, when the Conservatives lost power after implementation of the Reform Act 1867 and William Ewart Gladstone first became Prime Minister. In 1868, representation for Bridgnorth was reduced to one member, but Whitmore was returned (again defeating John Dahlberg Acton) and held the seat until 1870. In 1870, a by-election was held, and William Henry Foster elected to the seat, which he in turn held until its abolition in 1885.\nWhitmore married Adelaide Anna Darby, daughter of Francis Darby of Coalbrookdale, Shropshire, in 1852.  He died in 1876, at the age of 62.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton", "response": ["In 1859, Acton settled in England, at his country house, Aldenham, in Shropshire. He was returned to the House of Commons that same year as member for the Irish Borough of Carlow and became a devoted admirer and adherent of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. However, Acton was not an active MP, and his parliamentary career came to an end after the general election of 1865, when he headed the Liberal ballot for Bridgnorth near his Shropshire home. Acton defeated Conservative leader Henry Whitmore, who successfully petitioned for a scrutiny of the ballots, and thus retained his own seat and Acton lost his new seat. After the Reform Act 1867, Acton again contested Bridgnorth, this time reduced to a single seat, in 1868 but to no avail."]}, {"page": "Third Derby\u2013Disraeli ministry", "response": ["| Henry Whitmore"]}, {"page": "Second Derby\u2013Disraeli ministry", "response": ["| Henry Whitmore"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Henry Whitmore||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Bridgnorth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Henry Whitmore || rowspan=\"2\"| Conservative", "|1853 by-electionThe re-election of Sir Robert Pigot at the 1852 general election was voided on petition, triggering the 1853 by-election.
