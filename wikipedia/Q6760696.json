She had a relationship with W. B. Yeats starting in 1934. Their correspondence was published as Ah, Sweet Dancer (1970).\nYeats edited her poems for publication, but it is not clear how much change he made to them. He included some of them in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which he edited.\nSome of her poems have been set as songs by the composer Robert Erickson.\nShe was married twice: first to John Collis, with whom she had a son, Michael, and secondly to Raymond Lovell, with whom she had a daughter, Simone Lovell. She died in 1951, when she was 44.\nDuring her marriage to Raymond Lovell she had an affair with Yeats. When they met in 1934, Yeats was 69 and Ruddock`was 27.  Their affair was conducted fitfully over the next few years. The affair broke down and Ruddock became mentally unstable. Some months later she followed Yeats (uninvited) out to the island of Majorca, where he was working with the Indian monk Shri Purohit Swami. Ruddock ended up in an asylum in Madrid from where she was rescued by Yeats and his friends, but later died in another institution, St. Ebba's Hospital in Epsom.

During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: \"I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done\".Letter to Dorothy Wellesley, 17 June 1935; cited Ellmann, \"Yeats's Second Puberty\", The New York Review of Books, 9 May 1985 In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892\u20131935.
