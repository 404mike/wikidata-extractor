Despite losing Alex Gilbey after 36\u00a0minutes having been sent off for a challenge on Southend's Ryan Leonard, Colchester put in a solid defensive display against their county neighbour with only ten men. The defence soaked up the pressure until the 82nd minute, when former Colchester player Anthony Wordsworth struck with a 20-yard effort. A short while later, the home side's lead was doubled when Adam Barrett headed in Jack Payne's corner kick. Barrett celebrated by running the length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the Colchester fans. With tensions rising between the two sets of supporters, a lone Southend fan jumped onto the pitch, ran towards the away fans and began throwing punches into the crowd. Other Southend supporters followed by jumping onto the pitch before stewards and some players attempted to defuse the situation, while police said that an investigation into the incident would be launched. Southend added a third goal in the third minute of injury time when on-loan Southampton winger Sam McQueen scored from close range."]}, {"page": "2015 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Wycombe kicked off the first period of extra time.  Hayes early strike was wide and then his header went over the Southend bar.  In the 95th minute, Holloway was brought down by Timlin  out from the Southend goal and was awarded a free kick.  Jacobsen took the set piece and his strike passed over the wall, off the underside of the Southend crossbar and into the goal to make it 1\u20130 to Wycombe.  Almost immediately, Jack Payne was brought on to replace Worrall.  Wycombe controlled the remainder of the half and continued their domination into the second half of extra time.  In the 111th minute, Wycombe's Yennaris was replaced by Peter Murphy.  Leonard was booked four minutes later.  Two minutes into injury time, Weston's cross was partially cleared but Pigott brought the ball under control inside the Wycombe box, and struck a shot from  into the bottom corner of Lynch's goal to send the game into a penalty shootout.", "|MF ||19||Jack Payne|| || "]}]}}
