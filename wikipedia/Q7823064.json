In 2005, as part of the club's centenary celebrations, a poll was carried out to name the top 100 Tigers, and Norman was the highest-placed goalkeeper at number six. During his time at Boothferry Park, Hull completed a swift climb from the Fourth Division to the Second, and in 1986 finished sixth \u2013 their 2nd highest finish (they finished 5th in 1971) until they finally won promotion to the top flight 22 years later.On leaving Hull City, he signed for Sunderland for a then club record fee. During his time at Roker Park, he helped them win promotion to the top fight in 1990 and also played at Wembley in the 1992 FA Cup Final, where they lost 2\u20130 to Liverpool. He played a starring role in that cup run, including Man of the Match displays away to West Ham and at home to Chelsea. He is the only goalkeeper to have played for Sunderland at the old Wembley stadium twice.\nHe departed from Sunderland in the summer of 1995 to sign for Brian Horton (who had been his manager at Hull City) at Huddersfield Town. He remained in West Yorkshire for two seasons until he finally called time on his playing career in 1997 at the age of 39.\nDuring his lengthy career he played one season of top-flight football, when in 1990\u201391 he kept goal for a Sunderland side that suffered relegation on the final day of the season from the penultimate pre-Premiership First Division.\nHe made 5 international appearances for Wales, usually serving as deputy to the legendary Neville Southall.\nSince retiring from professional football Norman has been diagnosed with a rare heart condition called cardiomyopathy.

When he made his debut, against Oldham Athletic on 20 August 1977, aged 17, he became the youngest goalkeeper ever to play for Blackpool in a League game. As he ran out for the second half, he offended the Latics support by flashing them a \"V\" sign. In 1983, he was signed by Sheffield Wednesday, but didn't play a single game for the Owls. In 1986, he moved to Sunderland, where he played for two and a half seasons, before he moved to Hull City in December 1988, in a deal that saw Tony Norman move in the opposite direction. He was part of the Hull side that were relegated from the old Division 2 in 1991. He left the club, whereupon he signed for Maidstone United, who were also struggling at the time.

Sunderland dominated the early stages of the game and within five minutes had missed two chances to take the lead.  After less than two minutes, Pascoe flicked on a pass from Reuben Agboola to send Eric Gates clear on the left side of the penalty area.  His floated cross into the middle was missed by  Gabbiadini.  Then, a header from John McPhail into the Swindon penalty area was cleared.   In the sixth minute, Swindon had the first of a series of chances through White: this one he struck wide of Norman's goal.  The next, a volley, was held onto by Norman while the third, a header from a Shearer pass, was deflected over the Sunderland crossbar.  On 18 minutes, White then ran onto a weak backpass from McPhail and pushed the ball past Norman.  His shot rolled along the goal line and struck the post, and the deflection was then struck by Shearer but Norman kept the ball out.  Tom Jones then took a shot which Norman blocked with his legs.  In the 25th minute, Foley crossed from the right and found Alan McLoughlin just outside the Sunderland box.  He struck the ball which took a large deflection off Gary Bennett's boot, changing both its pace and direction, and beat Tony Norman in the Sunderland goal.  McLoughlin had spent most of the season as the attacking midfielder in Swindon's diamond formation but had not scored for three months leading up to the final.  In the 40th minute, David Kerslake's pass to White found him unmarked in the penalty area but Norman recovered the ball.  Just before half time, Kerslake and Jones worked the ball to Steve Foley but he headed over the Sunderland crossbar.", "|GK ||1||Tony Norman"]}]}}
