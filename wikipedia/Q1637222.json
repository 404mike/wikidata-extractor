He worked as a civil engineer before succeeding his paternal grandmother, Sibyl Hathaway, the 21st Dame of Sark, in 1974. During his rule, Beaumont saw the loss of many feudal rights enjoyed by the seigneurs, and he was consequently often described as the \"last feudal baron\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of seigneurs of Sark", "response": ["File:Michael Beaumont.jpg|John Michael Beaumont (1974\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "Francis William Beaumont", "response": [" In December 1927, Enid Beaumont gave birth to a son, John Michael Beaumont, who would become the 22nd Seigneur of Sark in 1974."]}, {"page": "2001 New Year Honours", "response": ["*John Michael Beaumont, Seigneur.
