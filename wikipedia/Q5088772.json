The match was an even affair during the first half: early on, Francis Green's header for Lincoln was off-target, and the team then saw a goal from Yeo ruled out.  Southend had two goal-bound chances cleared as the Lincoln goalkeeper Alan Marriott saved shots from both Carl Pettefer and Mark Bentley.  Southend dominated the second half, with Eastwood creating the best chance in the 56th minute but falling over the ball with only Marriott to beat from around .  Green then blocked a shot from Southend's Che Wilson before Bentley was denied a penalty after Paul Morgan appeared to foul him. Regular time ended goalless, sending the match into extra time.  Jamie Jackson, writing in The Observer, described the first 90 minutes of the match as \"tepid, uninventive fare\".   The first goal was scored just before half-time in the first period of extra time.  Spencer Prior flicked on Nicolau's corner and Eastwood struck Matt Bloomer's clearance into the Lincoln goal to make it 1\u20130.  With ten minutes of extra time remaining, Eastwood ran at the Lincoln defence and passed the ball square to Duncan Jupp who scored his first league goal in a decade to give Southend a 2\u20130 lead. With no further additions to the scoreline, the match ended 2\u20130 and Southend secured promotion to League One.", "|LB ||18 ||Che Wilson"]}, {"page": "2005 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|LB ||18|| Che Wilson"]}, {"page": "2004 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|LB ||14||Che Wilson || || "]}, {"page": "Richmond Athletic FC", "response": ["Richmond won the Nelson Pine Division 1 League back to back in 2010 and 2011 under coach Steve Bignall and Manager Rick Gower.
