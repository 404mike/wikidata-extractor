He was born in Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary in 1789. In 1812, after spending a short time in London as a clerk in Lubbock's Bank, he settled in Dublin and became a wealthy man trading in bark on Arran Quay \u2014 a business his late brother's father-in-law gave up to him. William Haliday his younger brother was a noted Irish language enthusiast.\n\nIn 1832, when cholera first appeared in Dublin, he became a campaigner for improved living conditions among the city's poor, a role he was to play for the remainder of his life. The following year, he was elected a Member of the Ballast Board, a corporation for improving Dublin harbour and superintending the lighthouses on the Irish coast. He also served for many years as consul for Greece, Honorary Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Dublin, and a Director of the Bank of Ireland.\nIn 1834 Haliday moved to Monkstown, County Dublin. In 1843 he bought Monkstown Park, previously the residence of Lord Ranelagh, which he demolished and rebuilt. His new house had a large library to house his growing collection of books, pamphlets and tracts on Irish history. It also included a large facade and a tower folly which both are protected structures today. Haliday was an avid collector of antiquities and compiled one of the largest private collections of Irish historical works. At his death his library comprised more than 29,000 pamphlets relating to Ireland, in addition to innumerable books, tracts, ballads, and broadsides.\nIn 1847 he was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. In 1850 he began to research the history of the port of Dublin on behalf of the Ballast Board. It was this work which led him to undertake a detailed study of the city's Scandinavian history \u2014 a period that had hitherto been almost entirely neglected by scholars.\nCharles Haliday died at Monkstown Park on 14 September 1866; he was buried nearby in Carrickbrennan Churchyard. His work on the early history of Dublin, The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin, was published posthumously in 1881. His vast collection of antiquities was inherited by his widow, Mary Hayes, who presented it to the Royal Irish Academy the following year.\nHis estate at Monkstown Park has since been used as an education premises. Corrig School {Monkstown Park School} operated there from the 1880s until the early 1920s. Since 1950 it has operated as the location for CBC Monkstown Park.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fingal", "response": ["*The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin, by Charles Haliday, edited by John P.

Turgesius Island, the principal island on Lough Lene, is named after him. It is not at all clear whether the names in the Irish annals represent the Old Norse Thurgestr or Thorg\u00edsl.The Vikings In Scotland And Ireland In The Ninth Century (Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in. 1998)W.E.D.

The theory was first published by John O'Donovan in 1860, prior to the posthumous publication of Haliday's papers."]}, {"page": "Early Scandinavian Dublin", "response": ["For more than a dozen years in the middle of the 9th century, most of the Viking raids in Ireland appear to have been part of a co-ordinated effort to conquer the country on behalf of the King of Laithlind. If later accounts are to be believed, this campaign was initially masterminded by a warlord referred to in Irish annals as Turgesius, Turg\u00e9is or Turges.The Old Norse form was \u00deurgestr. Variant forms that are sometimes found include \u00deorgest (Thorgest), \u00deorgils, \u00deorgisl and \u00deorgerr. The Old Norse forms of personal names, attested in the 12th or 13th century, are often quite different from the original Proto-Norse forms; the names recorded in contemporary British and Irish sources have the virtue of being contemporaneous with the original Scandinavian forms. According to the medieval Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, Thorgils was a son of the first King of Norway Haraldr h\u00e1rfagri (Harald Fairhair). However, that this son of Harald should be Turgesius is chronologically impossible, as Harald was born around 851. Turgesius\u2019s identity remains uncertain to this day. Some commentators have identified him with the semi-legendary Danish warlord Ragnar Lodbrok.John O'Donovan (1860), pp. liii ff. and p. 124; Charles Haliday (1884), pp. 30 ff; Todd (1867), p. liii; . According to Saxo Grammaticus,Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum Book 9 Ragnar raided Ireland, killing a king called Melbricus. This has been identified with a raid on Conaille Muirthemne in 831 in which the king M\u00e1el Brigte was abducted by Vikings.AU 831.6. Conaille Muirthemne was a dynastic sept that ruled a minor kingdom in County Louth in the overkingdom of Ulaid or Ulster. Turgesius has also been identified with a son of Gu\u00defri\u00de or Gudfred, the Danish king who fought against Charlemagne between 804 and 810.Montgomery (2006). It is thought unlikely, however, that he or any other Viking rulers in Ireland can be linked to native Norwegian dynasties.\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1998): \"The kings and sons of kings mentioned in the Irish annals cannot, therefore, be linked to any Norwegian dynasty.\"", "In late 869 the Great Heathen Army wintered in Thetford, East Anglia. In November they defeated Edmund the King of East Anglia and seized his kingdom.ASC(A) 870 [=late 869]. At this time the army was led by Ingware and Ubba, but the following year the army's two heathen kings are called Bachsecg and Halfdene (Halfdan Ragnarsson).ASC(A) 871, 872. In 870 \u00cdmar was campaigning with his brother Amla\u00edb in Scotland,AU 870.6. so it appears that his kinsman H\u00e1lfdan took his place as one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army in England. According to Aethelweard's Chronicon Igwares (Ingware) died in 870 \u2013 a detail which must be accounted for by those historians who believe that \u00cdmar and Iguuar were one and the same individual.\u00c6thelweard, p. 26. Charles Haliday (1884), p. 40, believed that the discrepancy of three years between the death of Igwares and \u00cdmar (AU 873.3) was insignificant, and he actually cited the early deaths of the two men as \"strong evidence\" that they were one and the same individual. Curiously, however, Haliday did not identify \u00c6thelweard's Igwares with the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's Ingware, whom he believed was an illegitimate brother of Igwares. Halfdene continued the conquest of northern England with the assistance of the Great Summer Army, which arrived in 871. Repton was taken in 873, which led to the fall of eastern Mercia. In the winter of 874 he settled on the Tyne in Northumbria, from which numerous attacks on the Picts and Strathclyde were launched.ASC(A) 875. In 875 or 876 Halfdene divided Northumbria in two: the northern kingdom of Bernicia remained a puppet state ruled by Angles, while the southern kingdom of Deira or J\u00f3rv\u00edk was ruled directly by the Danes. Halfdene then disappears from the Chronicle. In 875 Albdann (H\u00e1lfdan) is reported to have \"deceitfully killed\" Amla\u00edb's son Oist\u00edn (Eysteinn) and taken Dublin.AU 875.4; CGG 25.", "This period of Dublin's history is still very obscure. Despite the existence of a wealth of documentary evidence for Viking activity in the Dublin region throughout the 9th century, relatively little archaeological evidence has been unearthed to corroborate the testimony of contemporary annalists. The pioneering 19th-century historian Charles Haliday bewailed the silence of contemporary Irish sources \"respecting the social position, religion, laws, and monuments of those who occupied Dublin for more than three hundred years on all facts ... excepting such as relate to their inroads and devastations\".Haliday (1884), p. 4. Most of our knowledge concerning the day-to-day lives of the Norse settlers in Dublin has been learned from extensive excavations at Wood Quay and in the neighbourhoods of Winetavern Street and Fishamble Street. The Norse built their houses almost exclusively out of perishable materials such as wood and straw, but many early buildings have been preserved in this area in a two-metre-thick waterlogged layer of estuarine mud, making Dublin one of the most important Norse sites in Europe. To date, more than two hundred houses have been excavated."]}, {"page": "Carrickbrennan Churchyard", "response": ["Carrickbrennan Churchyard () located on Carrickbrennan Road, Monkstown, County Dublin, Ireland is a graveyard that can still be seen today, but is no longer in use.
