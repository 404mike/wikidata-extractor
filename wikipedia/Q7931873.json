His most successful book was his novel Candy Man (1971), which went through a number of editions in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries, and was a selection of the UK Science Fiction Book Club in 1972.\nJohn Clute, writing in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, said that his later novels \"tend to combine elements of epic and grotesque sf adventure with a characteristically English darkness of emotional colouring ... and a tendency towards downbeat conclusions.\"His novels were published by Gollancz, Tandem, Sphere Books and Futura Publications in England, and Ballantine Books in the United States. His short fiction was published in John Carnell's New Writings in SF series. Some of his work has been translated into French, Spanish and German.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Vincent King (1935\u20132000)"]}, {"page": "Falmouth, Cornwall", "response": ["*Rex Thomas Vinson (1935 in Falmouth - 2000) Art teacher, artist and science fiction author, wrote as Vincent King"]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF 7", "response": ["*\"Defense Mechanism\" (Vincent King) - from UK edition of New Writings in SF 9"]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF 8", "response": ["*\"The Wall to End the World\" (Vincent King) - from UK edition of New Writings in SF 11"]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF 9", "response": ["*\"Defense Mechanism\" (Vincent King)", "*\"Testament\" (Vincent King) - from UK edition of New Writings in SF 13"]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF 11", "response": ["*\"The Wall to End the World\" (Vincent King)"]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF", "response": ["Dozens of prolific authors contributed stories, some in series, such as James White's Sector General.
