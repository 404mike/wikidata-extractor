In 1980, Allan Whitwell joined the school staff and built up the rowing squad, which included boys who were already rowing at other clubs. Rowing disappeared for around a decade before being reorganised towards the end of the 1990s when the London Oratory School Boat Club acquired its first boat. By 2006, LOSBC had its first Schools' Head win in a coxed four. In 2012, the school won its first gold medal at the National Schools' Regatta, which was followed by the 1st VIII winning the 2016 Child Beale trophy, and qualifying for Henley Royal Regatta in 2015 and 2016. The boat club rowed out of Barn Elms for much of its existence, with a period at Putney Town Rowing Club, before moving to the Chiswick Boathouse next to Barnes Bridge in 2011. The boat club is now somewhat external to the school, managed by London Youth Rowing and races as The 1863 Club."]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1980 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Duncan McDougallAllan WhitwellHenry ClayChris MahoneyAndrew JusticeJohn PritchardMalcolm McGowanRichard StanhopeColin Moynihan (cox)"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1976 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Thomas Bishop, Mark Hayter, Andrew Justice, Allan Whitwell"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1980 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Henry Clay, Andrew Justice, Chris Mahoney, Duncan McDougall, Malcolm McGowan, Colin Moynihan, John Pritchard, Richard Stanhope, and Allan Whitwell \u2014 Rowing, Men's Eights", "* Henry Clay, Andrew Justice, Chris Mahoney, Duncan McDougall, Malcolm McGowan, John Pritchard, Richard Stanhope, Allan Whitwell, Colin Moynihan"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Clive Roberts, Adam Clift, Salih Hassan, Chris Mahoney, Duncan McDougall, Malcolm McGowan, John Pritchard, Allan Whitwell, Colin Moynihan"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in rowing (men)", "response": ["|Duncan McDougallAllan WhitwellHenry ClayChris MahoneyAndrew JusticeJohn PritchardMalcolm McGowanRichard StanhopeColin Moynihan"]}, {"page": "1978 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["| Allan Whitwell, Eric Sims, Charles Wiggin, Malcolm Carmichael", "| Lenny Robertson, Allan Whitwell, Henry Clay, Malcolm McGowan, Campbell, Gordon Rankine, Robert Milligan, Colin Seymour, Robert Lee (cox)"]}, {"page": "1986 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["|   Allan Whitwell (b)  Carl Smith (s)"]}, {"page": "1977 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["| Lenny Robertson, Allan Whitwell, Henry Clay, William Woodward-Fisher, Phil Gregory, Gordon Rankine, Robert Milligan, Colin Seymour, Robert Lee (cox)"]}, {"page": "1987 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["|   Carl Smith  Allan Whitwell"]}, {"page": "Alan Whitwell", "response": ["#REDIRECTAllan Whitwell"]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's quadruple sculls", "response": ["| Andrew JusticeMark HayterAllan WhitwellThomas Bishop"]}, {"page": "Carl Smith (rower)", "response": ["He represented England and won two bronze medals in the single scull and doubles scull with Allan Whitwell, at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland."]}, {"page": "Mark Hayter", "response": ["Hayter won the coxed pairs title rowing for the Kingston and Leander composite, with Richard Ayling, at the 1973 National Rowing Championships.
