In the 1980s Sheedy scored the most goals from free-kicks in the top-flight of the English football league. Perhaps his most famous free-kick moment came in an FA Cup tie against Ipswich Town in 1985 when he scored with a 19-yard free-kick into goalkeeper Paul Cooper's right-hand corner, but having been forced to re-take the kick, proceeded to curl the ball into the keeper's left-hand corner. He was selected in the PFA Team of the Year in both Everton championship winning years of 1985 and 1987."]}, {"page": "Laurie Sivell", "response": ["Sivell spent 15 years with Ipswich Town, between 1969 and 1984. He made 141 league appearances for the East Anglian club during that time, despite primarily being the understudy to goalkeepers including David Best and Paul Cooper. He  also played two games on loan to Lincoln City in the 1978\u201379 season. Sivell was noted for his bravery, typically diving at the feet of oncoming strikers to snatch the ball, and had considerable athletic ability to offset his diminutive size (for a goalkeeper).  Sivell contributed to Ipswich's victorious 1980-81 UEFA Cup campaign, making one appearance during the run. However he wasn't part of the squad for the final itself."]}, {"page": "1978 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Ipswich's first game in the 1977\u201378 FA Cup was away at Second Division Welsh club Cardiff City in the third round.  As Ipswich were in a poor run of form both domestically and in European competition, manager Bobby Robson had declared the FA Cup contest against Cardiff as \"the most important match the club is going to play this season\". Ipswich won the match 2\u20130 with both goals coming from Paul Mariner, the England international centre forward.  The match also saw captain Mick Mills making his 494th appearance for Ipswich, a club record.  Ipswich were drawn against Fourth Division Hartlepool United in the fourth round.  A controversial penalty awarded to Ipswich in the sixth minute was converted by Colin Viljoen after Derrick Downing was adjudged to have fouled Mariner.  Ipswich extended their lead with a second from Mariner before Downing pulled one back for Hartlepool.  Second half goals from Brian Talbot and Viljoen ended the tie 4\u20131 in favour of the East Anglian team who progressed to the fifth round where they faced Bristol Rovers.  The game was played on a frozen Eastville Stadium pitch and the lower league team came into the match against Ipswich having lost just two of their previous fourteen matches.  A Talbot throw-in was collected by Clive Woods whose cross was converted by Robin Turner.  Rovers' equaliser came early in the second half as Ipswich goalkeeper Paul Cooper failed to clear a corner which was subsequently headed in by midfielder David Williams.  Fifteen minutes later, the Bristol club took the lead, Williams scoring after a Russell Osman clearance.  Bobby Gould then scored for Rovers but the goal was disallowed and with four minutes to go, Mariner secured an equaliser to send the game to a replay at Portman Road.  Ipswich pressed early on but with no reward for their domination and had to wait until the 26th minute to capitalise.  A corner from Woods was converted by Mick Mills at the far post.  As Rovers went in search of an equaliser, Mariner scored following good passing work from Allan Hunter and Mills.  Woods scored a third with ten minutes remaining to end the match 3\u20130 and send Ipswich into the sixth round to face Millwall.", "|GK ||1 || Paul Cooper"]}, {"page": "Dave Latchford", "response": ["Latchford made his League debut in April 1969 in a 2\u20131 win at Bury, but with Jim Herriot, Paul Cooper and Mike Kelly also at the club it took another four years for him to establish himself as undisputed first choice.
