He began his football career in local football, and gained a reputation as both a goalscorer and a creator of chances while with Stourbridge. He joined Birmingham in December 1905, and made his debut in the First Division on 7 April 1906 in a goalless draw at Derby County. Though given a decent run of games, he was unable to perform at his best, so he returned to non-league football where he was again successful.", "link_mentions": {}}}
