In operator theory, he is best known for his work in the 1980s on the invariant subspace problem, where he constructed operators with only trivial invariant subspaces on particular Banach spaces, especially on \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u2113\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}}\n  . He won the 1985 Junior Berwick Prize for his work on the invariant subspace problem.Read has also published on Banach algebras and hypercyclicity; in particular, he constructed the first example of an amenable, commutative, radical Banach algebra.\nAt the time of his death, Read was a Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Leeds after having been a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge for several years. He completed his PhD thesis entitled Some Problems in the Geometry of Banach Spaces at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s.
