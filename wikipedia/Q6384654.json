He was promoted out of the Fourth Division with Gillingham in 1973\u201374. His professional career lasted from between 1964 and 1975 as he made 238 league and cup appearances in the English Football League.

Pre-season did not run smoothly however, as Lee fell out with Sammy Morgan, and had to contend with injuries to Roy Sproson, Stuart Sharratt, and top-scorer John James. Low attendances forced him to sell Clint Boulton to Torquay United for \u00a310,000. In December, he brought Ray Harford from Mansfield Town for a \u00a35,000 fee, as well as Keith Lindsey from Southend United for 'a small fee'. War in the boardroom continued, whilst only 2,809 turned up to see a 1\u20130 home win over Mansfield Town on 4 March. On 8 May, Sproson made his farewell competitive appearance for the club in front of only 2,743 supporters, and Lee angrily declared that \"the attendance was nothing short of a disgrace to mark the end of a legend\". Safety was assured with a 15h place finish, five points above relegated Mansfield Town.", "He did not retain the services of four players for the 1972\u201373 season: Mick Morris, Keith Ball, Stuart Sharratt, and John Flowers. Lee made some key signings however, bringing in Stafford Rangers goal-machine Ray Williams for \u00a33,000, midfielder Freddie Goodwin (Southport), 'controversial' goalkeeper Alan Boswell (Bolton Wanderers), young midfielder Colin Tartt, and trialist goalkeeper Reg Edwards (Nuneaton Borough). Six wins were gained from the opening eight league games, though low attendances caused Lee to remark that \"the people here are not genuinely interested in league football\". Offered the management position at Shrewsbury Town, he rejected the offer as he believed the club \"lacked potential\" and that he had a \"feeling of loyalty towards the [Vale] players\". In mid-season he sold John James to Chester for \u00a35,000, Ray Harford to Colchester United for \u00a31,750, and Keith Lindsey to Gillingham for \u00a3750, whilst spending \u00a32,250 to bring 'pacey' striker John Woodward in from Walsall. Lee's team was criticized for foul play, particularly on 10 March, when Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy branded them \"a brutal and physical side\". In the FA Cup, West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood claimed that the Vale players attempted \"the most blatant calculated intimidation I have ever seen anywhere in the world\". Vale finished in sixth spot with 53 points, four short of promoted Notts County.

By the end of September Vale were performing well on the pitch, and off it had sold the main car park to The Co-operative Group for \u00a330,000. Goals were at a premium despite a 4\u20133 win over York City and 4\u20134 draw with Aston Villa at Vale Park. Sporadic violence continued to break out at many matches, as local businesses had their windows smashed, local residents were menaced and fights broke out. In November, Clint Boulton was sold to Torquay United for \u00a310,000. The next month Lee brought Ray Harford from Mansfield Town for a \u00a35,000 fee, as well as Keith Lindsey from Southend United for 'a small fee'. Vale comfortable in the league, Chairman Graham Bourne resigned in January, along with colleague and fellow director George Sanders. This left the Board of Directors with just two members, one of which, previous chairman Mark Singer, was re-elected as Chairman. The Sentinel's Chris Harper stated that \"Vale will never make progress while they are plagued by trouble at the top\". The team continued with good home form, but invariably lost away from Vale Park. On 16 February, Sammy Morgan scored on his debut for Northern Ireland, and picked up six further caps whilst at the club. On 4 March, only 2,809 bothered to turn out for a 1\u20130 home win over Mansfield Town in strong wind and snow, whilst rivals Stoke City won the 1972 League Cup Final in front of a crowd of nearly 100,000 at Wembley Stadium. Vale went on to go ten games without a win, also scoring just one goal in a run of seven games, to the frustration of their supporters. Despite this, the now annual 'Meet the Manager' evening 'warmed the heart' of Lee. A 1\u20130 win over Barnsley at the end of April ensured the club's safety from the drop. On 8 May, Sproson made his farewell competitive appearance for the club in front of only 2,743 supporters, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Rotherham United. Lee angrily declared that \"the attendance was nothing short of a disgrace to mark the end of a legend\".

The club spent \u00a38,500 on new floodlights and a public address system, however attendances dropped off from the crucial 6,000 break-even number.
