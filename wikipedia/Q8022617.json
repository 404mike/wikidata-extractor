Her paternal grandfather played accordion, fiddle, and organ. Her father, Mike Tickell, sang and her mother played the concertina. Her first instrument was piano when she was six. A year later, she picked up a set of Northumbrian smallpipes brought home by her father, who intended them for someone else. Frustrated by fiddle and piano, she learned that the pipes rewarded her effort. She was inspired by older musicians such as Willy Taylor, Will Atkinson, Joe Hutton, and Billy Pigg."]}, {"page": "William Taylor", "response": ["*Willy Taylor (1916\u20132000), Northumbrian fiddler"]}, {"page": "Geoff Heslop", "response": ["*Harthope Burn (Joe Hutton, Will Atkinson and Willy Taylor)", "Joe Hutton, Willy Taylor, Will Atkinson, Mike Tickell, Allan Wood,", "*Welcome to the Dene (Willy Taylor)"]}, {"page": "Willy Taylor (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Willy Taylor"]}]}}
