Directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, it is a direct sequel to Casino Royale, and the second film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film also stars Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Gemma Arterton, Jeffrey Wright, and Judi Dench. In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is coincidentally seeking to avenge the murder of her own family. The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman Dominic Greene, a member of the Quantum organisation, which intends to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat in Bolivia to seize control of the country's water supply.\nProducer Michael G. Wilson developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series was being shot, and Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script. Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the screenwriter strike, they received no writing credits in the final cut. The title was chosen from a 1959 short story in Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only, though the film does not contain any elements of that story. Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage Douglas DC-3 was used for a flight sequence, and Dennis Gassner's set designs are reminiscent of Ken Adam's work on several early Bond films. Taking a course away from the usual Bond villains, Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains. The film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the University of Otago finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.Quantum of Solace premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008, receiving generally mixed reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance and the film's action sequences, but criticized the darker and realistic tone and felt that the film was less impressive than Casino Royale. As of September 2016, it is the fourth-highest-grossing James Bond film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589 million worldwide, and becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2008. The film was followed by Skyfall (2012).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Strawberry Fields", "response": ["Strawberry Fields  may refer to:", "* Strawberry Fields (memorial), a memorial to John Lennon in Central Park, New York, dedicated in 1985", "* Strawberry Fields (Guantanamo), a secret CIA compound built in 2003 at Guantanamo Bay", "* \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" (1967), a  song by the Beatles, inspired by an orphanage (see above)", "* Strawberry Fields (Canadian festival), a Woodstock-esque rock festival held in Mosport, Canada, August 6\u20139, 1970", "* Strawberry Fields (English festival), a music festival held annually since 2010 in Leicestershire", "* Strawberry Fields (Indian festival), an annual rock festival hosted in Bangalore by the National Law School of India University", "* Strawberry Fields (New Zealand festival), a former annual music festival in New Zealand", "* Strawberry Fields (play), a 1977 theatre play by Stephen Poliakoff", "* Strawberry Fields (1997 film), a film by Rea Tajiri", "* Strawberry Fields (2006 film), a documentary on Palestinian strawberry growers in Gaza", "* Strawberry Fields (2011 film), a psycho-drama film by Frances Lea and Judith Johnson", "* Strawberry Fields (character), a fictional agent in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace", "* Strawberry Fields (2007), the name for the US edition of Marina Lewycka's  novel Two Caravans", "* Strawberry Fields globe amaranth, a garden flower"]}, {"page": "Gemma Arterton", "response": ["Gemma Christina Arterton (born 2 February 1986) is an English actress and producer. After her stage debut in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost at the Globe Theatre (2007), Arterton made her feature film debut in the comedy St Trinian's (2007). She portrayed Bond Girl Strawberry Fields in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace (2008), a performance which won her an Empire Award for Best Newcomer.", "In 2008, she appeared in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. Chosen from around fifteen hundred candidates, Arterton plays Bond Girl Strawberry Fields, in what is described as a \"nice-sized role\". Arterton describes her character as \"the thinking man's crumpet\". In the same year, she played the eponymous protagonist in the BBC adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles.  Also in 2008, she played Elizabeth Bennet in the ITV serial, Lost in Austen. Her most controversial role to date was in the 2009 film The Disappearance of Alice Creed, in which her character is kidnapped and abused in several graphic nude scenes. The role required her to be handcuffed to a bed and wear a ball gag in her mouth throughout. She requested that she be left tied to the bed even when the camera was not on her to help her performance. She joked that the crew would put the ball gag back in if she was chatting too much.- -  The film was well received, with Frank Scheck for The Hollywood Reporter noting, \"Arterton\u2026 handles the rigorous physical and emotional demands of her role with great skill\".", "| Strawberry Fields"]}, {"page": "S\u00e9v\u00e9rine", "response": ["Some critics believed S\u00e9v\u00e9rine fit the general characteristics of a Bond girl. In Moviepilot, Jack Carr cited the character as the franchise's representation of women as sex objects, writing that she will \"inevitably wind up dead herself the morning after [...] in a cruel demonstration of instant karma\". While reviewing the evolution of the Bond girl, Rothman identified S\u00e9v\u00e9rine as following the trope of the damsel in distress, and Ian Dunt of Politics.co.uk found Bond's seduction of the character adhered to expectations for the franchise. However, Vanity Fair's Jim Windolf noted that unlike previous Bond girls, S\u00e9v\u00e9rine's name was not constructed from a double entendre. John Boone of Entertainment Tonight wrote that she was not as fully realized as Vesper Lynd's role in the 2006 film Casino Royale, but felt she was a more promising character than Mary Goodnight from The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) and Octopussy from the 1983 film of the same name. In contrast, The New Dailys Susannah Guthrie dismissed S\u00e9v\u00e9rine, along with Strawberry Fields and Camille Montes from Quantum of Solace (2008), as less memorable than previous Bond girls such as Goldfingers Pussy Galore and Dr. Nos Honey Rider."]}]}}
