Due to the inadequacy of Heybridge's stadium, the match was played at Colchester United's Layer Road ground.  Gillingham defeated their semi-professional opponents 2\u20130.  In the second round, they played fellow Third Division team Fulham at Priestfield; the initial match finished 1\u20131, necessitating a replay at Fulham's Craven Cottage stadium.  The replay also finished 1\u20131 but the rules of the competition meant that on this occasion extra time was played; Reinelt scored the winning goal during the extra period.  In the third round, Gillingham played Sheffield Wednesday of the FA Premier League; the match drew a crowd of 10,425, the largest attendance recorded at Priestfield since 1987.  Wednesday took a 2\u20130 lead in the first half and, despite having their starting goalkeeper, Kevin Pressman,  sent off and Pike scoring from a penalty kick, the Premier League team held on for a 2\u20131 victory.  David Hunn of the Sunday Times wrote that Gillingham \"dashed incessantly at their mighty but depleted visitors\" and \"went hell for leather for the equaliser\" but were thwarted by substitute goalkeeper Lance Key."]}]}}
