He attempted to sign Mark Bright from Leicester City for \u00a345,000, but the chairman could not agree terms with the player. The 1985\u201386 season saw Hull come very close to earning promotion to the First Division, finishing in sixth-place, which was then the third-highest finish in the club's history. At the end of the campaign Horton quit playing to concentrate on full-time management, having been sent off against Crystal Palace in his final appearance.

However, a dreadful run of results in which there was just one win in 17 games ended any hope of promotion. Their form was not helped by the sale of star play-maker Garry Parker to Nottingham Forest for a \u00a3270,000 fee, which Horton later admitted was a mistake. After a 4\u20131 home defeat to Swindon Town, chairman Don Robinson was furious and immediately fired Horton. The players took responsibility for the defeat and urged the chairman to re-consider, Robinson obliged, but Horton refused the offer of reinstatement.

The match is best remembered for the antics of Spurs playmaker Paul Gascoigne, whose high tickle on Garry Parker after just two minutes might have been expected to have merited an automatic red card, but was let off with a caution from referee Roger Milford. Soon afterwards Gascoigne ruptured his cruciate ligament while making another horror tackle on Gary Charles. He again escaped a red card, but was stretchered off the pitch and was out of action for a year afterwards. Pearce put Forest ahead after 16 minutes direct from a free kick and Mark Crossley saved a Gary Lineker penalty, becoming only the second player to do so in an FA Cup final. Paul Stewart equalised after 55 minutes and the match went into extra time. Clough opted not to talk to the players before extra time, instead remaining on the bench. Spurs ultimately won 2\u20131 after Des Walker inadvertently put the ball into his own net. A 19-year-old Roy Keane later admitted that he was not fit to play in the match, which he said was why he played such an insignificant role in the final.\"Keane; The Autobiography\".
