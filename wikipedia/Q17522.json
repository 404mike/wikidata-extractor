Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government into supporting the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine. A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton.

The term \"negative resistance\" was applied by some to this effect, but the term was controversial because it was known that the resistance of a passive device could not be negative.Emile Garcke, , also see letter by Andrew Gray on same page Beginning in 1895 Hertha Ayrton, extending her husband William's research with a series of meticulous experiments measuring the I\u2013V curve of arcs, established that the curve had regions of negative slope, igniting controversy. Frith and Rodgers in 1896 with the support of the Ayrtons introduced the concept of differential resistance, dv/di, and it was slowly accepted that arcs had negative differential resistance.

In its reply, the Council stated that the question of women fellows \"must depend on the interpretation to be placed upon the Royal Charters under which the Society has been governed for more than three hundred years\". When Hertha Ayrton was nominated for fellowship in 1902, her candidature was turned down on the basis that as a married woman she had no standing in law. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 made it illegal for an incorporated society to refuse admission on the grounds of an individual's sex or marital status. While the Society acknowledged the provision of section 1 of the Act in 1925, in reply to a question originally put to them by the Women's Engineering Society three years prior, it was not until 1943 that another woman was nominated for fellowship.
