His debut came two days later in Wolves' next game, a 2\u20130 win away to rivals Birmingham City in which Williamson received the man of the match award. After making three appearances, over the course of which the club conceded just one goal and picked up four points, his loan was initially extended until January, but he was recalled after five appearances in total because of injuries at his parent club. However, Williamson immediately picked up an injury of his own which subsequently kept him out for the rest of 2015\u201316 season."]}, {"page": "Gareth Ainsworth", "response": ["Ainsworth lost striker Joel Grant to Championship club Yeovil Town at the start of the 2013\u201314 season, and signed attackers Jon-Paul Pittman, Steven Craig, and Paris Cowan-Hall to replace him. Defenders Dave Winfield and Charles Dunne also left Wycombe for clubs in higher divisions (though Dunne was loaned back to Wycombe for the season as part of the transfer). He signed right-back Nick Arnold and midfielder Billy Knott on loan. In the January transfer window he sold 18-year-old centre-back Kortney Hause to Wolverhampton Wanderers, and signed 19-year-old former Arsenal winger Anthony Jeffrey on a free transfer. Wycombe ended an eight match run without a win with a 1\u20130 victory over league leaders Chesterfield on 22 February, earning Ainsworth a mention as the Football League manager of the week. On the final day of the season Wycombe needed to win at Torquay United and hope results went their way elsewhere in order to stay up; they won their match 3\u20130 and finished outside of the relegation zone on goal difference."]}, {"page": "1995 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 July \u2013 Kortney Hause, footballer "]}, {"page": "Our House (Madness song)", "response": ["The song has been adapted into an anthem by fans of football club Aston Villa, to refer to centre back Kortney Hause."]}, {"page": "Courtney", "response": ["*Kortney Hause (born 1995), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Dean Smith (footballer, born 1971)", "response": ["The club spent a net total of \u00a3144.5 million to bring in 12 players in the summer 2019 transfer window: Jota, Anwar El Ghazi, Wesley, Kortney Hause, Matt Targett, Tyrone Mings, Ezri Konsa, Bj\u00f6rn Engels, Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet, Douglas Luiz, Tom Heaton and Marvelous Nakamba.
