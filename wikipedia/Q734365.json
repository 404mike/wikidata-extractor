Trainer Dickie Gunn started the club at Hayes's Townfield School. Interim locations included St Christopher's Approved School and Harlington Scout Hut, until in 1978 the club was granted a piece of land at the back of Judge Heath Lane Sports Centre. A concerted effort by club-trainers, boxers and committee-members produced for the club a purpose-built gym. In 2006 the land on which the gym was built was sold for development, and, following a campaign, a replacement facility was built to the front of the former Hayes Stadium. From its formation, the club has produced successful boxers at national competition level. Chris Finnegan represented the pinnacle of the club's success, winning the 1966 Amateur Boxing Association Middleweight title, before going on to win the Olympic Middleweight gold medal in 1968.", "* Chris Finnegan (1944\u20132009), Olympic boxing gold medalist, lived in Hayes."]}, {"page": "Bob Foster (boxer)", "response": ["|align=left| Chris Finnegan"]}, {"page": "The Ring magazine Fight of the Year", "response": ["*1972 Bob Foster KO 14  Chris Finnegan"]}, {"page": "List of boxing families", "response": ["*Chris Finnegan (1944\u20132009), British, Commonwealth, and European light heavyweight champion"]}, {"page": "Iver", "response": ["* Chris Finnegan (1944\u20132009) British professional boxer of Irish descent born in Iver"]}, {"page": "Harry Scott (boxer)", "response": ["|align=left|  Chris Finnegan"]}, {"page": "Frank Warren (promoter)", "response": ["Warren was approached by his second-cousin Lenny McLean who having just lost a fight and wanting a rematch, could not find a promoter.
