Extension culminated in seafloor spreading around 30 million years ago, a process that propagated to the SW resulting in the V-shaped basin we see today. Extension ceased around 17 million years ago. Arguments have continued about the role of tectonic extrusion in forming the basin. Paul Tapponnier and colleagues have argued that as India collides with Asia it pushes Indochina to the SE. The relative shear between Indochina and China caused the South China Sea to open. This view is disputed by geologists who do not consider Indochina to have moved far relative to mainland Asia. Marine geophysical studies in the Gulf of Tonkin by Peter Clift has shown that the Red River Fault was active and causing basin formation at least by 37 million years ago in the NW South China Sea, consistent with extrusion playing a part in the formation of the sea. Since opening the South China Sea has been the repository of large sediment volumes delivered by the Mekong River, Red River and Pearl River. Several of these deltas are rich in oil and gas deposits."]}, {"page": "List of geologists", "response": ["* Peter Clift (born 1966), British marine geologist and monsoon researcher, best known for work in Asia"]}, {"page": "Outline of oceanography", "response": ["* Peter Clift \u2013 British marine geologist and geophysicist"]}, {"page": "Deep Carbon Observatory", "response": ["* Peter Clift, Louisiana State University"]}, {"page": "Clift", "response": ["*Peter Clift, British marine geologist and geophysicist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Aberdeen people", "response": ["* Peter Clift"]}, {"page": "Clift, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Clift"]}]}}
