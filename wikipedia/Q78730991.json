The club met in Bartolini's dining rooms near Fleet Street. Its official symbol was a mace carved to look like an African head gnawing on a human thighbone. The club's name is thought to derive from Burton's interest in cannibalism which he regretted that he never witnessed on his travels.Lovell, p. 413 Club members included: Richard Monkton Milnes, Charles Bradlaugh, Thomas Bendyshe, Algernon Swinburne, Sir James Plaisted Wilde, General Studholme John Hodgson and Charles Duncan Cameron."]}, {"page": "John Hunter (physician)", "response": ["Hunter's college dissertation De Hominum Varietatibus et harum causis (1775) was in the biological anthropology tradition.

The Reader was sold in autumn 1865 to Thomas Bendyshe. There were 211 weekly numbers, and the final issue appeared on 12 January 1867.", "The first editor was John Malcolm Ludlow, who was succeeded by David Masson.
