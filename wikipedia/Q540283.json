Duran Duran was one of the most popular bands in the world during the 1980s due in part to their music videos which played in heavy rotation in the early days of MTV. Taylor played with Duran Duran from its founding in 1978 until 1997, when he left to pursue a solo recording and film career. He recorded a dozen solo releases (albums, EPs, and video projects) through his private record label B5 Records over the next four years, had a lead role in the movie Sugar Town, and made appearances in a half dozen other film projects. He rejoined Duran Duran for a reunion of the original five members of the group in 2001 and has remained with the group since.\nTaylor was also a member of two supergroups: The Power Station and Neurotic Outsiders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 20", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 John Taylor, English singer-songwriter, bass player, and actor "]}, {"page": "Roxy Music", "response": ["In 1997, John Taylor of Duran Duran produced the tribute album Dream Home Heartaches...

The group was a leading band in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US in the 1980s. The group was formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later addition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related) and lead singer Simon Le Bon. These five members featured in the most commercially successful line-up.", "After a couple of minor singles, the band's first major hit was \"Girls on Film\" (1981), from their self-titled debut album, the popularity of which was enhanced by a controversial music video, which in heavily edited form, played in rotation on MTV.  The band's breakthrough album was Rio (1982), their second album, which peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 album chart in the US, number two in the United Kingdom, and number one in Australia and Canada.  The songs \"Rio\" and \"Hungry Like the Wolf\", which featured cinematic music videos, became two of their biggest hits, with the latter winning the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 1984.  Their follow-up third album Seven and the Ragged Tiger became their only UK number one album; it also reached top ten status in the US, Canada, Australia, and several other countries, and featured the US and UK number one single \"The Reflex\".  In 1985, the band topped the US charts with the single \"A View to a Kill\" from the soundtrack of the film of the same name.  Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor both left before the recording of the band's fourth album, 1986's Notorious, which was produced by Nile Rogers and featured the top ten single, also named \"Notorious\".  The band spent the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s continuing to release albums and singles, to only moderate success.  Their comeback album, 1993's Duran Duran (commonly called The Wedding Album) returned the band to their former superstar status, featuring two top-ten worldwide hits \"Ordinary World\" and \"Come Undone\".  A 1995 album of cover songs, Thank You, produced a minor hit in the critically acclaimed cover of Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day\", but was otherwise critically panned.  After John Taylor left in 1997, the band released a number of albums and singles which (compared to prior releases) underperformed on the sales charts.  A full reunion of the original lineup of LeBon, Rhodes, and all three Taylors in 2001 led to a number of highly successful concert tours and the 2004 album Astronaut, which reached number 3 in the UK and top 40 in numerous other countries.  The album's lead single \"(Reach Up for The) Sunrise\" was an international dance hit, and reached number five in the UK.  Andy Taylor left again in 2006, and the band has released four additional albums, with the most recent being Future Past in October, 2021.", "John Taylor and Nick Rhodes formed Duran Duran in 1978, in Birmingham, England, where they became the resident band at the city's Rum Runner nightclub. They were doing jobs at the club, John working the door and Nick deejaying for \u00a310 a night. They began rehearsing and regularly playing at the venue. There were many nearby nightclubs where bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash played gigs; the most significant was called Barbarella's. They went on to name the band after \"Dr. Durand Durand\", Milo O'Shea's character from the sci-fi film Barbarella.", "The band's first singer was Stephen Duffy. Simon Colley soon joined Taylor, Rhodes and Duffy. Colley was the band's original bass player, as John Taylor was the guitarist at this point. This was the first complete line-up of the band that played live shows. For percussion, an electronic drum machine belonging to Rhodes was used. After Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979, a few guitarists were auditioned, mostly unsuccessfully, as well as a handful of vocalists. Andy Wickett, brought on in 1979 as lead vocalist, had a major part in the writing of \"Girls on Film\" during his tenure with the band, according to Andy Taylor's autobiography. Wickett is featured on the demos that were presented to EMI in 1980. According to both Wickett's and John Taylor's websites, Wickett co-wrote an early version of the song that came to be known as \"Rio\". Upon Colley's and Wickett's departures, the band enlisted singer Jeff Thomas and guitarist Alan Curtis, each for only a relatively brief period.", "The meeting of drummer Roger Taylor in 1979 with John Taylor, Rhodes and Wickett at a party, as well as the departure of Colley, led John Taylor to switch to bass. Roger Taylor then became their original (human) drummer. It was this line-up (John Taylor on bass and guitar along with Rhodes, Wickett and Roger Taylor) that made the first-ever Duran Duran studio demo tapes. In April 1980, guitarist Andy Taylor came from Newcastle upon Tyne to audition after responding to an advertisement in Melody Maker. In May 1980, London vocalist Simon Le Bon was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the Rum Runner. The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys and barmen when they were not rehearsing.", "Teen and music magazines in the UK latched onto their good looks quickly, and the USA soon followed. It was a rare month in the early 1980s when there was not at least one picture of the band members in teen magazines such as Smash Hits or Tiger Beat. John Taylor once remarked that the band was \"like a box of Quality Street [chocolates]; everyone is someone's favourite\"De Graaf & Garret (1982), p. 15. Duran Duran later came to regret this early pin-up exposure, but at the time it helped attract national attention. In an interview with Rock Fever Superstars Magazine in early 1988, John Taylor stated:", "Even with Duran Duran on hold, band members were soon anxious to record new music, leading to a supposedly temporary split into two side projects. John Taylor and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson to form the rock/funk supergroup the Power Station, which released two Top 10 singles. Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed Arcadia, who released one LP (So Red the Rose) from which the single \"Election Day\" was released. Contributors to that album included guitarist Masami Tsuchiya, bassist Mark Egan, percussionist David Van Tieghem, drummer Steve Jordan, Sting, Herbie Hancock, and David Gilmour. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. Duran Duran were never the same after this break. According to Rhodes, the two side projects \"were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that.\" The band was still off balance when they regrouped to contribute \"A View to a Kill\" to the 1985 James Bond movie of the same name. This single was the first Bond theme to go to number 1 on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number 2. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.", "===1986\u20131989: Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor trio===", "Without a guitarist or a drummer, the three remaining members, Le Bon, Rhodes, and John Taylor had producer (and former Chic guitarist) Nile Rodgers play a few tracks on guitar, and hired Steve Ferrone to play drums while they searched for replacements. Finally in September 1986, Warren Cuccurullo (formerly of Missing Persons and Frank Zappa's band) was hired as a session guitarist. With Le Bon, Rhodes, and Taylor, he recorded the rest of the Notorious album, which was released in October 1986. The black-and-white documentary film Three to Get Ready chronicled the recording of the album, legal tensions, and preparations for the tour.", "The compilation album Decade was released late in 1989, along with the megamix single \"Burning the Ground\", which consisted of woven snippets of the band's hits from the previous ten years, created and produced with John Jones, who began working with the band after Big Thing. The single came and went with little fanfare, but the album became another major seller for the band. However, the 1990 release Liberty (a retreat from the experimentation of Big Thing) failed to capitalise on any regained momentum. The album entered the UK album chart in the top ten, but faded away quickly. The singles \"Violence of Summer (Love's Taking Over)\" and \"Serious\" were only mildly successful. For the first time, Duran Duran did not tour in support of an album, performing on only a handful of club dates and TV shows. Sterling Campbell left the band early in 1991, going on to work with Soul Asylum and David Bowie. The quartet of Le Bon, Rhodes, Taylor, and Cuccurullo would remain intact for six more years. In December 1991, John Taylor (then 31) married 19-year-old model/actress Amanda De Cadenet, and she gave birth to his daughter in March 1992.", "\"Come Undone\", primarily written by Cuccurullo, with lyrics by Le Bon, made number 7 in the US and number 13 in the UK. Both the band and the record label seemed to be caught by surprise by the album's critical and commercial success (No.\u00a04 in the UK, No.\u00a07 in the US). Bassist John Taylor had been considering leaving the band but changed his mind. The band's largest tour ever, which included stops in the Middle East, the then recently de-embargoed South Africa, and South America, was halted after seven months when Le Bon suffered from strained vocal cords. After six weeks' recuperation, the band performed intermittently for another five months, including appearances in Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia.", "===1997\u20132000: John Taylor's departure and second trio===", "After the promo tour for Thank You was completed, John Taylor co-founded the B5 Records label, recorded a solo album, founded and toured with the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders, and reunited the Power Station, though the project proceeded without him when he had to withdraw to deal with his divorce from De Cadenet. Finally, after struggling for months to record the next album, Medazzaland, in January 1997, Taylor announced at the DuranCon fan convention that he was leaving the band \"for good\". His departure reduced the band to two long time members (Le Bon and Rhodes) and Cuccurullo, who decided to continue recording under the name Duran Duran.", "In 2000, Le Bon approached John Taylor with a proposal to reform Duran Duran's classic line-up. They agreed to part company with Cuccurullo after completing the Pop Trash tour. Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band Missing Persons. This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran's website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger, and Andy Taylor had rejoined. To fulfill contractual obligations, Cuccurullo played three Duran Duran concerts in Japan in June 2001, ending his tenure in the band.", "On 4 March 2013, the band returned to the studio to work on their 14th studio album, and continued during the week beginning 23 September. They reconvened 13 to 18 December. On 31 December 2013, the band posted a mixtape curated by John Taylor as a New Year's \"thank you\" to their fans. On 10 February 2014, John Taylor and Roger Taylor worked with the Voce Chamber Choir and London Youth Chamber Choir on vocals for use on some Duran Duran tracks.", "In December 2016, the original band members Le Bon, Rhodes, Andy Taylor, John Taylor and Roger Taylor lost a case in the British High Court after they attempted to reclaim the U.S. copyright on their first three albums from Gloucester Place Music, part of EMI Music Publishing. Rhodes commented, \"We signed a publishing agreement as unsuspecting teenagers, over three decades ago, when just starting out and when we knew no better... if left untested, this judgment sets a very bad precedent for all songwriters of our era.\" In March 2020, Duran Duran signed with the Warner/Chappell Music publisher, covering their post-1986 catalogue.", "In video game culture, bassist John Taylor was the model for Dante, the protagonist of the hit PlayStation 2 game Devil May Cry. Dante mirrors John Taylor's looks with his long rocker hairstyle, clothing, and mannerisms.", "The MTV cable channel and the band were launched at about the same time, and each had a hand in propelling the other to greater heights.. \"Duran Duran became multimedia stars because MTV, to paraphrase bassist John Taylor, could not get videos of 'Stairway to Heaven'\" MTV needed showcase videos with charismatic performers. Les Garland, senior executive vice-president at MTV, said \"I remember our director of talent and artist relations came running in and said, \"You have got to see this video that's come in\". Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was the greatest video I'd ever seen\". The band's video work was influential in several ways. First, Duran Duran filmed in exotic locales like Sri Lanka and Antigua, creating memorable images that were radically different from the then-common low budget \"band-playing-on-a-stage\" videos. Second, rather than simply playing their instruments, the band participated in mini-storylines (often taking inspiration from contemporary movies: \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" riffs on Raiders of the Lost Ark, \"The Wild Boys\" on The Road Warrior, etc.). Videos were obviously headed in this direction already, but Duran Duran led the trend with a style, featuring quick editing, arresting graphic design, and surreal-to-nonsensical image inserts, that drew attention from commentators and spawned a wealth of imitators.", "* John Taylor\u00a0\u2013 bass (1979\u20131997; 2001\u2013present), backing vocals (1978\u20131997; 2001\u2013present), guitars (1978\u20131979)"]}, {"page": "1960 in music", "response": ["*June 20 \u2013 John Taylor, bassist of Duran Duran"]}, {"page": "2000 in film", "response": ["| The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas || Universal Pictures / Amblin Entertainment || Brian Levant (director); Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont, Jim Cash, Jack Epps Jr..
