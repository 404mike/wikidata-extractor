The 2003 crossover film Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-day Comedy, for example, avoided direct references to Mormonism. Its director, Andrew Black, sought to focus on other elements of the story, with Mormon culture as \"just a backdrop.\" Professor Travis T. Anderson argues that LDS films revolving around universal human themes\u2014such as \"challenges, struggles, desire, and day-to-day experiences\"\u2014with just a splash of religious undertones achieve success in the movie market despite the Mormon cultural aspects they carry, which can seem strange to general audiences. He cites The Other Side of Heaven (2001), Saints and Soldiers (2003), Napoleon Dynamite (2004), and New York Doll (2005) as examples of such \"critical and financial success stories in Mormon cinema.\" Saints and Soldiers gained recognition at multiple small film festivals; and the 2001 murder mystery Brigham City, while not praised by audiences, received critical acclaim. The documentary New York Doll tells the story of a member of a rock band\u2014who also happens to be Mormon\u2014and the reconciliation of his two worlds. It demonstrates the commonly-held goal of Mormon filmmakers to bridge the gap between how Mormons are perceived and the concept of the typical American. Larry Miller, owner of the Utah jazz, invested millions of dollars into producing The Work and the Glory (2004) in an effort to tell the story of the history of the LDS Church. Mormon filmmakers have often made the argument that films with distinctly Mormon characteristics have the potential to appeal to general audiences. Additionally, LDS films have been featured in theaters around the United States. Mormon cinema has also been the subject of aesthetic discussion. Doc Films, a student film society at the University of Chicago, hosted a Mormon film series in 2007."]}, {"page": "Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy", "response": ["Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy is a 2003 independent romantic comedy film directed by Andrew Black and produced by Jason Faller. The screenplay, by Anne Black, Jason Faller, and Katherine Swigert, is an adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice set in modern-day Provo, Utah. The film stars Kam Heskin as college student Elizabeth Bennet whose dreams of becoming an author supersede the cultural and societal pressures to be married. Elizabeth tries to escape the advances of several bachelors, including handsome but haughty businessman Will Darcy.", "Director Andrew Black and his colleagues developed the idea for Pride & Prejudice while studying at Brigham Young University (BYU). After graduating, Black decided to stay in Utah to produce a film. Black's short film The Snell Show, having won Best Short award at the Slamdance Film Festival, aided Black in obtaining investors for his first feature-length film project. Producer Jason Faller decided that the novel Pride and Prejudice would be good source material for a film based in Provo, Utah, due to similarities between the Regency era and Latter-day Saint culture: expectations to marry young and the emphasis on pre-marital chastity. However, Black and Faller sought to \"make a film that [would] appeal to both insiders and outsiders,\" with LDS culture serving as \"just a backdrop.\" Thus, direct references to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or BYU were omitted, and the subtitle A Latter-day Comedy did not appear on the DVD cover."]}, {"page": "Camera 40 Productions", "response": ["Camera 40 Productions is an independent film production company based in Utah, USA.
