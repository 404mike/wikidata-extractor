In the navy, he rose from rating to lieutenant, working at the radar research establishment at Malvern, and testing radar on bombers. He emerged in 1946 as a lieutenant, and on the completion of his degree he joined what became the Commonwealth Relations Office, where he stayed until 1966.  He was appointed CMG on his retirement in the 1967 New Year Honours.\nIn 1967 he became the Director of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England, until 1983. He also served a term as Vice-President of the Society for Nautical Research. He was also the author of over forty books and numerous articles on maritime history, many of them produced in collaboration with his second wife, Ann Giffard. His best-known book was his two-volume The Merchant Schooners (1951\u201357). He also published Westcountrymen in Prince Edward's Isle (1967), on Devon shipbuilders in Canada, and Boats And Boatmen of Pakistan (1971).\nIn 1980, Dr Greenhill received a PhD from Bristol University on his published work, and honorary doctorates from Plymouth University and Hull in 1996 and 2002.\nDr. Greenhill died at St. Dominick, Cornwall on 8 April 2003.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eppleton Hall (1914)", "response": ["Despite the fact that Eppleton Hall was already in a partially scrapped condition and would have been equally suitable to provide either or both of her two engines, attempts to negotiate with the then NMM Curators Mr. Basil Greenhill and the Viscount Runciman of Doxford collapsed following six months of deliberations on the part of the NMM. The final communication between the two museums was described by Newhall in his book as being \"fatuous, uncooperative or downright insulting\", as it seemed to suggest that adapting the identical non-running engines from the scrap tug for display in Greenwich would require \"massive re-planning\", that Reliant could not possibly steam intact from Newcastle to San Francisco, and, by implication, that the San Francisco Maritime Museum could not afford to pay for either venture."]}, {"page": "RMS Campania", "response": ["In their day, Campania and her sister offered the most luxurious first-class passenger accommodation available.
