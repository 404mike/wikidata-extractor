He was on the books of Hibernian before going south to join Woolwich Arsenal of the English Second Division in 1894. On the evidence of practice matches, the Kentish Mercury wrote that Caldwell appeared to be just the left back Arsenal needed: \"a safe tackler, can keep the forwards off his goalkeeper, has a good pace, and is very clever at overhead kicking.\" He must have justified the opinion, because he was ever-present through the 1894\u201395 season and missed only one match in the next, in partnership with regular right-back Joe Powell. At the end of the season, he returned to Scotland and joined Third Lanark. He was reported to have been willing to stay, but his wife-to-be was reluctant to move south.", "Caldwell continued his good form with Third Lanark. He was selected for the Glasgow Association team to face Sheffield, and was touted for full international honours. At the end of November 1896, Joe Powell died of blood poisoning and tetanus after breaking his arm during a match. Caldwell was reportedly anxious to return to his former club, and within weeks, he was back. He played in most matches of what remained of the season and the start of the next, but Alex McConnell also came into consideration at left back. Caldwell was suspended sine die in the second half of the season, but reinstated on reduced wages around the time that manager Thomas Mitchell resigned, and he finished the campaign playing at right back."]}]}}
