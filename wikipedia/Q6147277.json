Keyboard player Franny Griffiths joined the line-up a year later, and the band rose to prominence throughout the mid-1990s with hit singles such as \"Female of the Species\", \"Me and You Versus the World\", \"Neighbourhood\", \"Avenging Angels\" and \"The Ballad of Tom Jones\", the latter a duet with Cerys Matthews of Catatonia.\nAlthough the band's initial work drew comparisons to 1960s guitar groups such as The Kinks and The Who, which got them thrown in with the emerging Britpop scene, Space disregarded the term and pursued a more eclectic sound dubbed \"queasy listening\" by critics, embracing electronica and sampling in their work and drawing from genres as diverse as hip hop, techno, post-punk, ska, lounge music, easy listening and film scores, the result of the differing tastes between bandmembers. The group also became known for their deliberately tongue-in-cheek, dark humoured lyrics, which were inspired by Scott's love of cinema, and frequently dealt with topics such as serial killers, failed relationships, social outcasts, and mental illness. Whilst Space's eclecticism and camp humour polarised listeners and critics, they have maintained a devoted cult following.\nSpace experienced several lineup changes, with Scott being the only consistent member. The band recorded four studio albums; their first two albums, Spiders (1996) and Tin Planet (1998), were both commercially successful and went platinum in the UK, whilst their proposed third, Love You More than Football, experienced production problems and was shelved before it was due for release; plus a number of charting singles. The band disbanded in 2005, following low sales and a lukewarm reception to their fourth album Suburban Rock 'n' Roll (2004), which has  in recent years been reevaluated as the band's best.\nScott went on to form The Drellas, which in 2011 morphed into the second incarnation of Space after Griffiths (and briefly Murphy) joined the group. Space have continued to release studio albums, including Attack of the Mutant 50ft Kebab (2014) and Give Me Your Future (2017). In 2019, twenty years after it was recorded, Love You More than Football was officially released as part of a career-spanning Anthology boxset. The band's most recent album, Music for Pleasure Music for Pain, was released in 2021.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tin Planet", "response": ["In 1996, Space released their debut album Spiders on Gut Records. Combining surreal, darkly humorous lyrics and a large number of styles and genres, including rock, techno, hip hop and funk, a result of the different musical tastes of the band members, the album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and becoming certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in December 1996 for sales of over 300,000. Nonetheless, in mid-1997, during their tour of the United States, where the band began to find minor success, numerous personal problems hit the band. The band were constantly under stress, which reached such an extent that keyboardist Franny Griffiths developed an ulcer, lyricist and vocalist Tommy Scott lost his voice and the band's guitarist and other lyricist and vocalist, Jamie Murphy, \"still only 21, simply lost it completely and had a spell in psychiatric care being fed anti-depressants and milk.\"", "After touring and promotional commitments of Tin Planet concluded in late 1998, Space returned to the studio to commence work on their third album, tentatively titled Love You More than Football. However, Gut Records objected to Edwyn Collins being chosen as producer, and forced the band to rework the material several times, delaying its release for over two years until it was eventually scrapped in July 2001. By that time the band had terminated their contract with Gut and Jamie Murphy, who was growing restless and distant from the others, was dismissed from the line-up. Love You More than Football now primilarly exists as a bootleg, due to a promotional copy on CD-R which circulated around May 2000.", "*Lead vocals on tracks 4 and 9: Jamie Murphy"]}, {"page": "Spiders (album)", "response": ["Space were formed in Liverpool in 1992 by vocalist and bass guitarist Tommy Scott, guitarist and co-vocalist Jamie Murphy and drummer Andy Parle and were initially inspired by The Kinks, Jimi Hendrix and The Who. Scott had been a familiar face on the Liverpool music circuit since the early 1980s; his first band, Hello Sunset, had been supported by an early line-up of The La's. Scott and Murphy had previously performed together in The Substitutes before renaming the band Space. Although most of the band were in their mid-20s, Murphy was only 17, and turned up to the band's first rehearsal session dressed in his school uniform. Space recorded their debut single, \"If It's Real\", to fulfill a publishing deal they had signed with BMG. It was released on 5 July 1993 as a 12\" single through Hug Records, set up by the band's long-time manager and supporter Mark Cowley, with artwork designed by Carl Hunter of The Farm. However, the trio were unhappy with the results, feeling it sounded 'generic' and too similar to other Liverpool bands at the time, and set out to find a new direction.", "\"Love Child of the Queen\", a tongue-in-cheek guitar pop song, is the first of three consecutive tracks written and sung by Jamie Murphy. \"No-One Understands\" is a \"satirical lament\" according to Johnny Cigarettes of NME, which features \"overly mixed guitars\" which make the song \"maddeningly and engrossingly repetitive\", whilst \"Voodoo Roller\" takes inspiration from the 1995 film The Usual Suspects. \"Drop Dead\" is a funk rock track sung from the point of view of a celebrity stalker, whilst \"Dark Clouds\" is an ironic \"holiday siesta\" featuring a trumpet solo.\"", "* Jamie Murphy - Guitar, vocals "]}, {"page": "Suburban Rock 'n' Roll", "response": ["The long hiatus between albums and lack of substantial material began affecting the band's ability to play live, as former guitarist/vocalist Jamie Murphy recalls: \"When it was 3rd album time, I think we\u2019d been away from it all for about a year and we had a tour while we had nothing out. We were doing 2000 capacity venues and there\u2019d only be 400 people there. So we were going onstage every night going, \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s going on here? What have we done wrong?\u201d.", "Eventually, the album were scrapped in July 2001. By that time, the band had terminated their contract with Gut, which according to frontman Tommy Scott, was due to creative differences rather than financial issues: \"It took us a year to get out of it. One of the problems we had in the past was that we felt we were being pushed in the wrong direction - like they were trying to turn us into The Beautiful South or something, when in fact we never wanted that at all, we just wanted to be a cult band\". Meanwhile, Jamie Murphy, who was growing estranged from the others, was dismissed from the line-up. According to Murphy, because tensions were running high at the time, the exchange was never made face-to-face between his bandmates, and was informed only by the management that he was out of the group. The recordings for Love You More than Football primarily existed as a bootleg, courtesy of a promotional CD-R which circulated around May 2000, before an official remixed version was released in 2019.", "Whilst recording Suburban Rock 'N' Roll, the band made a conscious decision not to repeat the sound of their last two albums, and set out to explore more experimental methods, with a greater emphasis on sampling. Jamie Murphy's departure affected the direction of the music, as Yorkie noted: \"Some of the tracks have no noticeable guitar whereas you know Jamie being a proper sort of guitar hero type person wouldn't allow that, it would, if there was a space there for guitar there would be guitar. So it's a little bit sparser, maybe a little bit more disciplined the sound and its allowed I think texture wise like the keyboards and other things that we use like the samples to come through a bit more.\" The band credited the New York synth punk duo Suicide as a big influence on the album, and would often listen to their debut album on their way to the studio, providing inspiration for the track \"Pretty Suicide\".", "Three singles were issued from Suburban Rock 'n' Roll: \"Zombies\", \"Suburban Rock 'n' Roll\" and \"20 Million Miles from Earth\". \"Suburban Rock 'n' Roll\" was the only single that managed to chart, peaking at a lukewarm #67 in the UK, and the only one to receive an official music video, although an animated clip for \"20 Million Miles from Earth\" was released on the band's website. The album itself failed to chart altogether, and was met with a mixed reception from the press. Despite having left the band prior to its recording, Jamie Murphy praised the album, calling it the group's best.
