The significance of this position in Roman culture has been interpreted variously. Kenneth Dover thought it might represent the relative sexual emancipation of Roman women.Kenneth Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Harvard University Press, 1978), p. 107, as cited by Fredrick, p. 159. From a woman's perspective, the position would grant an independence of movement for her own pleasure.Catherine Johns, Sex or Symbol? Erotic Images of Greece and Rome (Routledge, 1982), pp. 136\u2013137, as cited in Fredrick, p. 159. Paul Veyne, however, thought it emphasized that the woman had to do the work of servicing the man, who lies there and receives pleasure without effort.Paul Veyne, \"La famille et l'amour sous le haut-empire romain,\" Annales: \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations 33 (1978) 53\u201354, as cited in Fredrick, p. 159. The position may have been favored for art because it pleased both male and female viewers: for men, it offered an unobstructed view of the woman's body, as recommended by Ovid, and of the penis entering the vagina; women saw the visually dominant female figure playing the active role.Fredrick, pp. 159\u2013160."]}, {"page": "Hoxne Hoard", "response": ["The jewellery may have represented the \"reserve\" items rarely or never used from the collection of a wealthy woman or family. Some of the most common types of jewellery are absent, such as brooches, pendants, and earrings. Items set with gems are notably missing, although they were very much in the taste of the day. Catherine Johns, former Senior Curator for Roman Britain at the British Museum, speculates that the current or favourite jewellery of the owner was not included in the hoard.", "The first comprehensive research on the Hoard was published in the full catalogue of the coins by Peter Guest in 2005, and the catalogue of the other objects by Catherine Johns in 2010. The hoard was third in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 BBC Television documentary Our Top Ten Treasures, which included archive footage of its finder, Eric Lawes, and the \"Empress\" pepper-pot was selected as item 40 in the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series A History of the World in 100 Objects."]}, {"page": "Snettisham Hoard", "response": ["In 1985 there was also a find of Romano-British jewellery and raw materials buried in a clay pot in AD 155, the Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard.
