He originally worked with Terry Sullivan driving taxis, and they went into business together. During the early 1990s, Mick's character was expanded and he was given a free-spirited wife (Suzanne Packer) who regularly came and went, usually causing trouble along the way, resulting in Mick raising their two young children alone. The character eventually settled into life in the Close at number 5, but endured relentless racism, several disastrous relationships, became addicted to steroids and suffered unemployment and depression \u2013 but it was a euthanasia storyline in 1997 that saw Mick shockingly facing murder charges. His new wife Elaine (Beverly Hills) had brought with her a terminally-ill mother, Gladys, and during the summer months of 1997 Gladys's health rapidly deteriorated as she begged her daughter and son-in-law to end her life. Eventually, both Mick and Elaine relented to her pleas and they smothered her as she slept. Mick and Elaine were both arrested on suspicion of murder, and following a bitter and acrimonious court case, Mick was eventually acquitted of Gladys's murder. However, his marriage to Elaine was over and they quickly divorced, with unlucky Mick becoming a single father once again."]}, {"page": "Tikkabilla", "response": ["The show features two different presenters and a small dragon puppet named Tamba, who resembles Spyro the Dragon in colouration.
