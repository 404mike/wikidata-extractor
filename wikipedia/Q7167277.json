He served as a pilot and commander, and was the first officer of the RAF to be awarded the DSO three times during the Second World War. He flew over a hundred sorties and distinguished himself in a variety of operations requiring coolness under fire. Some consider Pickard of the same calibre as Guy Gibson and Leonard Cheshire.In 1941 he participated in the making of the 1941 wartime film Target for To-night, which made him a public figure in England. He led the squadron of Whitley bombers that carried paratroopers to their drop for the Bruneval raid.\nThroughout 1943 he flew the Lysander on nighttime missions into occupied France for the SOE, performing insertions of agents and picking up personnel from very small landing strips. Pickard led a group of Mosquitos on the Amiens raid, in which he was killed in action 18 February 1944.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Operation Biting", "response": ["The two commanders believed that training by both airborne troops and aircrews could be completed by the end of February when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for such an operation to take place.

Another problem encountered was the state of training of the unit of airborne troops chosen to raid the installation."]}, {"page": "Group captain", "response": ["* Percy Charles Pickard World War II bomber pilot and captain of \"F for Freddie\" in Target for Tonight, killed in Operation Jericho"]}, {"page": "Framlingham College", "response": ["*Percy Charles Pickard, World War II pilot and leader of Operation Jericho"]}, {"page": "Pick", "response": ["* nickname of Percy Charles Pickard (1915\u20131944), British Royal Air Force pilot"]}, {"page": "RAF Tempsford", "response": ["*Group Captain Percy Charles Pickard was awarded a second bar to his DSO in March 1943 for his outstanding leadership in command of 161 Squadron"]}, {"page": "No. 311 Squadron RAF", "response": ["|Sqn Ldr Percy Charles Pickard, DFC."]}, {"page": "Percy Pickard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Percy Charles Pickard"]}, {"page": "Charles Pickard", "response": ["#redirectPercy Charles Pickard"]}, {"page": "Target for Tonight", "response": ["Filming also took place at RAF Bomber Command headquarters in High Wycombe, with the head of Bomber Command Sir Richard Peirse and Senior Air Staff Officer Sir Robert Saundby appearing in the film.Johnston & Carter (2002), p. 141.
