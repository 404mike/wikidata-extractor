John Maddicott has called Godberd \"that prototype Robin Hood\".J.R. Maddicott, \"Edward the First and the Lessons of Baronial Reform\" in Coss and Loyd ed, Thirteenth century England: 1 Proceedings of the Newcastle Upon Tyne Conference 1985, Boydell and Brewer, p. 2. Some problems with this theory are that there is no evidence that Godberd was ever known as Robin Hood and no sign in the early Robin Hood ballads of the specific concerns of de Montfort's revolt.Dobson and Taylor, introduction.", "It has long been suggested, notably by John Maddicott, that \"Robin Hood\" was a stock alias used by thieves.Dobson and Taylor, pp. xxi\u2013xxii. What appears to be the first known example of \"Robin Hood\" as a stock name for an outlaw dates to 1262 in Berkshire, where the surname \"Robehod\" was applied to a man apparently because he had been outlawed.D. Crook English Historical Review XCIX (1984) pp. 530\u201334; discussed in Dobson and Taylor, pp. xi\u2013xxii. This could suggest two main possibilities: either that an early form of the Robin Hood legend was already well established in the mid-13th century; or alternatively that the name \"Robin Hood\" preceded the outlaw hero that we know; so that the \"Robin Hood\" of legend was so called because that was seen as an appropriate name for an outlaw."]}, {"page": "Witan", "response": ["The terms  and  are increasingly avoided by modern historians, although few would go as far as Geoffrey Hindley, who described  as an \"essentially Victorian\" coinage.

Edward met \"the thegns of all England\" at Hursteshever, probably modern Hurst Spit opposite the Isle of Wight. There he was received as king in return for his oath that he would continue the laws of Cnut.

The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, John Maddicott, and Seymour Phillips re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts.;  With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the king were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.; ; ; ; "]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelstan", "response": ["\u00c6thelstan became the first king of all the Anglo-Saxon peoples, and in effect overlord of Britain. His successes inaugurated what John Maddicott, in his history of the origins of the English Parliament, calls the imperial phase of English kingship between about 925 and 975, when rulers from Wales and Scotland attended the assemblies of English kings and witnessed their charters.Maddicott, The Origins of the English Parliament, pp. 7\u20138, 13 \u00c6thelstan tried to reconcile the aristocracy in his new territory of Northumbria to his rule. He lavished gifts on the minsters of Beverley, Chester-le-Street, and York, emphasising his Christianity. He also purchased the vast territory of Amounderness in Lancashire, and gave it to the Archbishop of York, his most important lieutenant in the region. But he remained a resented outsider, and the northern British kingdoms preferred to ally with the pagan Norse of Dublin. In contrast to his strong control over southern Britain, his position in the north was far more tenuous.Higham, The Kingdom of Northumbria, p. 192; Keynes, \"England, c. 900\u20131016\", p. 469", "A key mechanism of government was the Royal Council (or witan). Anglo-Saxon kings did not have a fixed capital city. Their courts were peripatetic, and their councils were held at varying locations around their realms. \u00c6thelstan stayed mainly in Wessex, however, and controlled outlying areas by summoning leading figures to his councils. The small and intimate meetings that had been adequate until the enlargement of the kingdom under Edward the Elder gave way to large bodies attended by bishops, ealdormen, thegns, magnates from distant areas, and independent rulers who had submitted to his authority. Frank Stenton sees \u00c6thelstan's councils as \"national assemblies\", which did much to break down the provincialism that was a barrier to the unification of England. John Maddicott goes further, seeing them as the start of centralised assemblies that had a defined role in English government, and \u00c6thelstan as \"the true if unwitting founder of the English parliament\".Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, pp. 63, 77\u201379; Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 352; Maddicott, The Origins of the English Parliament, p. 4"]}, {"page": "Exeter College, Oxford", "response": ["* John Maddicott \u2013 History fellow"]}, {"page": "Parliament of England", "response": ["After the unification of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the 9th and 10th centuries, assemblies became national institutions which played an important role in government.

The historian John Maddicott has traced the origins of the English Parliament back to \u00c6thelstan's great assemblies in the tenth century:\"These portentous gatherings were the lineal ancestors of the more brightly illuminated councils and parliaments of the post-Magna Carta world.

Nevertheless, Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of the provisions. As such, the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document; Montfort wanted to avoid a repetition of the situation after the Mise of Amiens. Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons."]}]}}
