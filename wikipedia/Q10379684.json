He then broke the overall English league record in the club's following game four days later, beating the previous record of 1,103 minutes, set by Steve Death of Reading in 1979. Another clean sheet, against West Ham on 8 February 2009, extended the record to 1,212 minutes, beating the British top-flight record of 1,155 minutes previously set by Aberdeen's Bobby Clark in 1971. Finally, on 18 February 2009, Van der Sar further extended the record to 1,302 minutes, and in doing so, he broke Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Buljubasich's single-season world record of 1,289 minutes, set in the Chilean Clausura in 2005. His clean sheet record ended on 4 March, when he made an error allowing Peter L\u00f8venkrands of Newcastle United to score after 9 minutes. In total, Van der Sar had gone 1,311 minutes without conceding in the league. These clean sheets were a major factor in United clinching their 11th Premiership title as United won a lot of games 1\u20130 to clinch the title ahead of Liverpool. With a total of 21 clean sheets he also won the Barclays Golden Glove for 2008\u201309. However, he missed out on winning his third Champions League winners medal as United succumbed to a 2\u20130 defeat at the hands of Barcelona in the final of the tournament on 27 May 2009. Nevertheless, he won Best European Goalkeeper award from UEFA for the second time, 14 years after he first won it at Ajax.

Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25\u201330 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. \"I'll never forget it\", Thomas recalled. \"It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pel\u00e9 and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen.\" Reading went on to win the game 5\u20130. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, \"Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week.\""]}, {"page": "Shaka Hislop", "response": ["Shortly after graduating, Hislop was spotted by a scout from Reading at a friendly indoor match against Aston Villa of the Premier League. He went on to sign professional forms with Reading for the 1992\u201393 season and remained there for two more years. While there, he established himself as a firm fan favourite after an uncertain start, twice earning the club's \"Player of the Year\" award. He was instrumental in Reading's rise from the third tier of English football to the brink of the Premier League, where he narrowly missed out on promotion following a 4\u20133 defeat to Bolton Wanderers in the 1995 play-off final, and was voted the club's Player of the Season in 1994\u201395. Hislop was one of many Reading players to move that summer of 1995, signing with Newcastle United for \u00a31.575m. In a poll to compile the Royals' greatest-ever XI, Hislop was voted the best goalkeeper with 46.7% of the vote ahead of Steve Death and Marcus Hahnemann. He was also voted joint third along with Death in a poll to decide the club's 'Player of the Millennium'."]}]}}
