Her father is English and her mother is of Scottish and Welsh descent. Knightley has an older brother, Caleb. Macdonald worked as a playwright after her acting career came to an end. Knightley's parents encountered substantial financial difficulties following the birth of her brother;Getting There: Sharman Macdonald  as-appeared in Stagewrite (Summer 1999) \"I was desperate for a second child. Desperate never to act again. Most of all desperate to stop eating lentils, French bread and tomatoes. We were broke, Will and me. We had one child. My hormones were screaming at me to have another. So. Will bet me a child for the sale of a script\" her father, a \"middling\" actor, agreed to a second child only if her mother sold a script first. However, her parents' varying degrees of success did not deter Knightley's curiosity about the profession. Macdonald introduced her own children to theatre and ballet very early. This inspired Knightley's interest in acting.", "Knightley appeared alongside Sienna Miller, Cillian Murphy, and Matthew Rhys in John Maybury's 2008 wartime drama The Edge of Love. The film had her play the role of Vera Phillips, a childhood friend of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin Macnamara. Knightley wrote the script with her mother, Sharman Macdonald, with Macnamara in mind. After Knightley signed on, her character's role was increased with the film focusing on her romance with a British soldier. Knightley connected to Vera's quietness, and described her as \"tragic and beautiful\".  She based her performance on Marlene Dietrich, and was to mime to her prerecorded voice, before being told by Maybury to sing live. Knightley initially felt embarrassed to do so, saying she \"[shook] like a leaf\" but eventually went through with the plan. Upon release, the film became a moderate critical and commercial success.-  Knightley's performance and singing abilities were praised;The Independent noted that Knightley \"gives Vera an independence and complexity that's aeons ahead\", while the Los Angeles Times wrote \"the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!)\".- "]}, {"page": "Elizabeth McGovern", "response": ["*When I Was a Girl I Used to Scream and Shout (Sharman Macdonald)"]}, {"page": "List of British playwrights since 1950", "response": ["*Sharman Macdonald"]}, {"page": "Benvolio", "response": ["A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet's final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio and Paris restored to life and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.
