The Irish antiquarian, John Windele, identifies Chetwode as the author of these books in 1839. Blue-stocking Hall is an epistolary novel set in County Kerry, and advocates for women's education. A book called Snugborough has also been ascribed to Chetwode. A number of Chetwode's poems, noted with her initials, are amongst the Wilmot papers in the Royal Irish Academy.
