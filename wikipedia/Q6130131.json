He \"did not put a foot wrong\" in his first seasons at the club, before establishing himself as the centre of Stoke's half-back line between James Bradley and George Baddeley following Alf Wood's departure in March 1901. For the next ten seasons Holford was a near ever-present in the Stoke team, racking up 105 consecutive appearances from March 1903 to March 1906. His good performances won him an England cap in 1903 and he is considered the smallest centre-back ever to play for England at just 5\u00a0ft 5. During Holford's time at the club he played the game in a fiery style, although he was never sent off. He succeeded George Baddeley as captain in 1905. Holford's manager Horace Austerberry described him as \"an excellent passer of the ball and one who played every match as if it was his last\". In 1908 Stoke went bust and dropped out of the English Football League and played in the Birmingham League. Holford was too good to be lost to non-league football and so he had to leave his home-town club, who he played nearly 270 games for.Matthews, Tony: \"The Encyclopedia of Stoke City \" (Lion Press, 1994, )"]}, {"page": "George Baddeley", "response": ["Born in Fegg Hayes, Stoke-upon-Trent, Baddeley attended Fegg Hayes Church of England School.

This trio played together 74 times for Stoke at senior level and became a formidable midfield three.
