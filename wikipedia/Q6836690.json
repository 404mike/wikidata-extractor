Lucas promises to get the council to replace the tree. Jordan and Abi argue when he feels she does not care and their friendship ends. He wonders if it is his fault that the people around him are dying. When the truth emerges that Lucas allowed Trina to die, killed Owen and kidnapped Denise, Jordan tries to stick by his father when the rest of the family run out, but then leaves in fear when he discovers that, rather than outright killing Trina, Lucas could have saved her but chose not to. Lucas is then arrested. When Jordan visits Denise with the rest of the family, he does not speak and just clutches his Bible. Finding it hard to come to terms with what has happened, Jordan eventually opens up to Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), crying on his shoulder. The next day he worries that no one will want to be friends with him because they all know about Lucas. However, after he ends his romance with Abi, he is happy that they agree to remain friends. Jordan then says goodbye to his sister Chelsea and Libby, who are moving away after their ordeal in Walford. On his birthday, Jordan receives a card from his father, but asks Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) to throw it away, and says he has to now look after Denise. However, Jordan is unable to speak to Denise about Lucas, so stays in contact with his aunt Gloria MacDonald (Michele Austin). Denise discovers they have been in contact for several months and allows Jordan to spend Christmas with her. Jordan is happy at his aunt's house, so Denise reluctantly lets him stay there."]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role", "response": ["| Michele Austin"]}, {"page": "Austin (surname)", "response": ["* Michele Austin, British actress"]}, {"page": "Another Year (film)", "response": ["* Michele Austin as Tanya"]}, {"page": "The Anniversary, Part Two", "response": ["* PC Yvonne Hemmingway (Michele Austin)"]}, {"page": "Second Nature (2003 film)", "response": ["*Michele Austin as Nurse"]}, {"page": "The Casual Vacancy (miniseries)", "response": ["*Michele Austin as Kay Bawden"]}, {"page": "Dark Heart (TV series)", "response": ["Jason Maza, Michele Austin, Alex Carter and Gregg Chillin joined the cast following the departures of Brooke and Holdbrook-Smith, who was unable to return to the series because of other filming commitments.
