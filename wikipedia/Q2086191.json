The Pity of War London: Basic Books. p. 217.  On 8 May 1920, also under the editorship of Steed, The Times in an editorial endorsed the anti-Semitic fabrication The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion as a genuine document, and called Jews the world's greatest danger. In the leader entitled \"The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry\", Steed wrote about The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery? If so, whence comes the uncanny note of prophecy, prophecy in part fulfilled, in part so far gone in the way of fulfillment?\".Friedl\u00e4nder, Saul (1997). Nazi Germany and the Jews.

There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist Matvei Golovinski fabricated the text for Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire, as a work of counter-revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution, by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some passages, from The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a 19th-century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly."]}, {"page": "Ballylickey", "response": ["* Philip Graves, journalist and exposer of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as a hoax "]}, {"page": "1953 in Ireland", "response": ["*3 June \u2013 Philip Graves, journalist and writer (born 1876)."]}, {"page": "The Britons", "response": ["They also published anti-Semitic books including a translation allegedly by Victor E. Marsden, of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. It has been noted that Marsden had died on 28 October 1920; the Britons ceased publication of the first imprint which Norman Cohn states came out in 1921. However, the earliest imprint bearing the name of Marsden held by the British Library has date 1922 and whose online catalogue shows that it was imprinted by the Britons Publishing Society. No scholarly work exists on Marsden, a one-time correspondent for The Morning Post, and there has not yet been an accounting of how precisely his name came to be associated with the publication of The Protocols. In August 1921, the text was conclusively exposed by Philip Graves as a plagiarism. The translation used was made by George Shanks for Eyre & Spottiswoode. Researcher Nick Toczek claims that for the sum of \u00a330, The Britons purchased a set of printing plates and the publishing rights to The Jewish Peril: The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion from that company. The Britons continued to publish and sell The Protocols for the rest of their existence, eventually producing 85 editions. Known from 1922 onwards as the Britons Publishing Company, this separate publishing arm produced material for such groups as the British Union of Fascists and other UK anti-Semitic and fascist organizations until 1975."]}, {"page": "Caitlin Thomas", "response": ["Caitlin's maternal grandfather, Edouard Majolier, was a French Quaker corn merchant in London, whilst her grandmother, Susannah Cooper, was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord, and a sister-in-law to Alfred Perceval Graves and an aunt to Joseph Maunsel Hone and Philip Graves.

Originally from Yorkshire, they came to Ireland with Oliver Cromwell, when their ancestor, Colonel William Graves (who became a Cavalier after being placed in charge of Charles I of England) commanded a Regiment of Horse and was granted land there in 1647. The Colonel's descendants held various public offices in the county (Richard Graves' grandfather, John, and uncle, Richard, both served as High Sheriff of County Limerick), but the family is particularly noted for its scholars \u2013 John Greaves and Thomas Greaves; clergymen \u2013 Charles Graves, Robert Perceval Graves, etc.; But most of all writers \u2013 Richard Graves, Alfred Perceval Graves, Clotilde Graves, Philip Graves, Robert Graves and Charles Patrick Graves. Another branch of the Colonel's descendants were elevated to the peerage and became notable for the number of them (seven) who served as Admirals in the Royal Navy.

After Philip Graves provided evidence in The Times of London that the Protocols were in reality a composite document which, for the most part, had been constructed/plagiarised from a variety of other writings which had been published previously to the appearance of the Protocols, Reventlow published his support for Fry's theory in the periodical La Vieille France.

The abridged version was available to the public in 1903. The unabridged version was later edited by a retired officer of the Russian Imperial Guard, G.V. Butmi. This forgery exploits Jews by stating that Jews were inevitably trying to exercise a coup against Christianity in order to essentially rule the world. The document was exposed as plagiarism by English journalist Philip Graves in 1921. Graves exposed the strong similarities in the political satire by Maurice Joly, The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu. The forged document was supported and promoted by Henry Ford in his newspaper, The Dearborn Independent."]}, {"page": "David Icke", "response": ["The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an anti-Semitic literary forgery, probably written under the direction of the Russian secret police in Paris, purporting to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a forgery in 1920 by Lucien Wolf and the following year by Philip Graves in The Times. Once exposed, it disappeared from mainstream discourse until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s. Interest in it was further spread by conspiracy groups on the Internet.Juliane Wetzel, \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion on the internet: How radical political groups are networked via anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,\" in Esther Webman (ed.), The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth, New York: Routledge, 2012 (147\u2013160), p. 148. According to Michael Barkun, Icke's reliance on the Protocols in The Robots' Rebellion is \"the first of a number of instances in which Icke moves into the dangerous terrain of antisemitism\".Also see Norman Simms, \"Anti-Semitism: A Psychopathological Disease,\" in Jerry S.
