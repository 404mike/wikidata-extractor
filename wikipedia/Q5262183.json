He enjoyed a five-year professional career in Scotland with Falkirk, Hamilton Academical, Raith Rovers, and Queen's Park; and also briefly played for English club Port Vale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1998\u201399 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season started poorly with three defeats, Lee Hughes scoring a hat-trick for West Bromwich Albion to finish this run off. Two wins opened the month of September, though the month ended with former-Valiant Lee Mills scoring a brace for Bradford City in a 4\u20130 win over Vale at Valley Parade. In October, Derek McGill signed from Queens Park Rangers, though he would move on to Hamilton Academical later in the year. On 29 October, Gareth Ainsworth became Vale's biggest ever transfer as he was sold to Wimbledon for \u00a32 million. In November, Robin Berntsen became the first Norwegian to play for the Vale when he arrived on loan from Troms\u00f8 IL. In addition to this French forward Christophe Horlaville joined on loan from Le Havre, and Des Lyttle also arrived on loan from Nottingham Forest. After winning the first four games in October, Vale then went on a streak of twelve defeats in fifteen games, though the sole victory of this run, a 1\u20130 win over Bury on 19 December, would prove to be crucial at the end of the season. The win was not enough for Rudge, who would get the sack in January after he made his final two signings: Trinidadian midfielder Tony Rougier from Hibernian for \u00a3175,000, and young striker Marcus Bent from Crystal Palace for a \u00a3375,000 fee. After Rudge was sacked by Chairman Bill Bell, highly distressed fans formed a \"flat cap protest\" (Rudge's headwear of choice) against the decision. Offered the role of Director of Football at the club, he instead took up the same position at rivals Stoke City. To replace him, Bell appointed experienced manager and former Vale player Brian Horton, paying Brighton & Hove Albion \u00a380,000 in compensation.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Derek McGill", "| October 1998 || FW ||  || Derek McGill ||  Queen's Park || Free transfer || ", "| December 1998 || FW ||  || Derek McGill ||  Hamilton Academical || Free transfer || "]}]}}
