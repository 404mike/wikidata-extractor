Through the mediation of Dorothy Woodman, Lamb managed to meet a senior official in the Indian High Commission in London in order to bring these facts to India's notice. However, he states the official was least interested. The more he checked the published Indian documents, the more convinced he became of \"distortions and misquotations\". Thus he came to the \"reluctant conclusion\", he says, that the Indian government was least interested in the historical accuracy of its territorial claims. This motivated him to write The China-India border in 1964, where he claims he did his utmost to \"play down the defects of the Indian published material\". In 1966, he expanded the book into a large two-volume work titled The McMahon Line."]}, {"page": "Woodman (surname)", "response": ["* Dorothy Woodman (1902\u20131970), British socialist activist and journalist"]}]}}
