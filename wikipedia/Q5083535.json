He was then offered a position with a chaff mill in Tynte Street, North Adelaide, with an option to purchase. Under his management the production of chaff rose from three tons a week to thirty. He took in a partner, Charles Willcox. Eleven years later he decided he could comfortably retire to England, but after experiencing one winter he decided Australia was his true home and at the end of fourteen months returned to South Australia. He had fortunately not given up his interest in the fodder business. His nephew William Gilbert Payne (ca.1865 \u2013 5 April 1926), also from Aylesbury, emigrated around 1885 and helped with his uncle's chaff and fodder business, which, as Gilbert & Co. opened mills at Gawler and Wasleys, handling 1,000 tons a month, much of it exported to Sydney. He sold the business, perhaps to Payne, who continued its management after Gilbert's death."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Gumeracha", "response": ["| Charles Willcox"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1897\u20131900", "response": ["|| Charles Willcox || North-Eastern ||  || 1897\u20131902 ||"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1900\u20131902", "response": ["|| Charles Willcox || North-Eastern ||  || 1897\u20131902 || vacated by Act 1902"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1896\u20131899", "response": ["|| Charles Willcox  || NDL || Gumeracha || 1896", ": Gumeracha NDL MHA Charles Willcox resigned on 18 June 1896 following concerns about his status as a government contractor.
