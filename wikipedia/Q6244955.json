Sally Gainsbury of the Nuffield Trust said many current plans involve shifting or closing services... \"Our research finds that, in a lot of these kinds of reconfigurations, you don't save very much money - all that happens is the patient has to go to the next hospital down the road.  They're more inconvenienced... but it rarely saves the money that's needed.\"NHS cuts 'planned across England' BBC There will be a shift from inpatient to outpatient care but critics fear cuts that could put lives at risk, that the plans dismantle the health service rather than protecting it, further that untested plans put less mobile, vulnerable people at risk.  By contrast, NHS England claims that the plans bring joined-up care closer to home. John Lister of Keep Our NHS Public said there are too many assumptions, and managers desperate to cut deficits were resorting to untried plans.Plan to 'transform' NHS could lead to downgrade of major London hospitals The Guardian  A survey of ninety-nine clinical commissioning group chairs and accountable officers conducted by the Health Service Journal in October 2016 found very little confidence that the plans would deliver."]}, {"page": "Private providers of NHS services", "response": ["According to John Lister 30% of all mental health spending in 2018-9 was in the private sector and in child and adolescent mental health services 44%.  The boundary between healthcare, which is free, and social care, which is meanstested, is quite unclear in this area.  The process of deinstitutionalisation, which involved the closure of the large asylums, meant the transfer of patients to community care, much of which is regarded as social care.  In 2019 13% of inpatient beds in England were provided by American companies. According to the Candesic consultancy around \u00a31.8 billion of the \u00a313.8 billion spent by the NHS on mental healthcare in 2018, including non hospital services, went to the private sector. About 25% of NHS mental healthcare beds in England were provided by the private sector, and 98% of their earnings came from the NHS."]}]}}
