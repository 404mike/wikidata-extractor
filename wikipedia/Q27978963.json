He helped Peterborough to win promotion out of League One at the end of the 2020\u201321 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aldershot Town F.C.", "response": ["* Note that Idris Kanu was sold to Peterborough United for an undisclosed but potentially club record fee in August 2017."]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["Building for the 2018\u201319 season, Aspin released ten players and transfer-listed a further four, whilst bringing in ten new signings and five loan players. Incoming were mostly free transfer signings and included promoted Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper Scott Brown, Cambridge United captain centre-half Leon Legge, 30-year old Carlisle United central midfielder Luke Joyce and troubled but talented Peterborough United striker Ricky Miller (signed for an undisclosed fee); also arriving were Alfreton Town winger Brendon Daniels, Aldershot Town Player of the Year Manny Oyeleke, The New Saints centre-back Connell Rawlinson, Gateshead defender Theo Vassell, Stevenage midfielder Tom Conlon, and former AFC Bournemouth loanee Ben Whitfield, whilst former fan's favourite Louis Dodds, teenage striker Idris Kanu, forward Scott Quigley, full-back Mitch Clark and midfielder Lewis Hardcastle also joined on season-long loan deals. The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch. I fully accept results from December have been poor and expected to be higher up the table and know the players are capable of doing that.\""]}, {"page": "List of foreign EFL Championship players", "response": ["*Idris Kanu \u2013 Peterborough United 2021\u2013"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Peterborough United F.C. season", "response": ["|19||Idris Kanu||CF||||London||||27||0||Aldershot Town||1 August 2017||Undisclosed||2020", "|19||||CF||Idris Kanu                                              ||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0||1||0||0", "| 1 August 2017 || CF ||  || Idris Kanu || Aldershot Town || Undisclosed || "]}]}}
