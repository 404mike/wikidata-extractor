He has written several books highly critical of IQ testing and related concepts in the field of psychometrics, such as Spearman's g. He contends that the definitions of intelligence, and the assumptions of its causes, \"lie at the core of political ideologies\", and has called for IQ tests to be banned. He has supported this position by arguing that IQ tests do not measure cognitive ability, but rather conformity with the culture of the tests' designers. Richardson debated the measurement of intelligence with philosopher of science Michael Ruse on the BBC's In Our Time.Richardson's son, Brian Richardson, is a senior manager in the Science Web and Interactive Media Team at the Open University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ken Richardson", "response": ["Ken Richardson or Kenneth Richardson may refer to:", "*Ken Richardson (baseball) (1915\u20131987), American baseball player", "*Ken Richardson (ice hockey) (born 1951), Canadian hockey player", "*Ken Richardson (racing driver) (1911\u20131997), British racing driver", "*Ken Richardson (athlete) (1918\u20131998), English athlete", "*Ken Richardson (basketball) (1950\u20132013), American basketball player", "*Ken Richardson (psychologist) (born 1942), British psychologist", "*Ken Richardson (public servant), Official Secretary to the Governor-General of New Zealand from 1990 to 1993"]}]}}
