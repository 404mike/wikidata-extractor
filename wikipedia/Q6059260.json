Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special two-hander episode aired in November 1998, featuring only Pat and Peggy for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to Roy (Tony Caunter), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity. The episode, written by Tony Jordan, featured what the Sunday Mirror described as one of \"the most vicious fights ever filmed by a soap\",  with both throwing glasses at one another and Pat slapping Peggy across the face exclaiming \"You bitch!\" and Peggy responding by slapping Pat exclaiming \"You cow!\". According to press reports, the fight scene between the characters was \"so powerful that it had to have scenes and dialogue cut so it could be screened before the 9\u00a0pm watershed.\" Barbara Windsor was reportedly bruised during the filming. Windsor commented, \"The writer didn't want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. When I saw the programme I couldn't believe how good it was. Pam and I were really proud.\" The Sunday Mirror described it as: \"one of the most impressive episodes of all time\". In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact."]}, {"page": "Mike Reid (actor)", "response": ["In 1987, he joined the cast of popular BBC television soap opera EastEnders as Frank Butcher, for which he gained much popularity over the years. He initially joined the series as a semi-regular character, first appearing in September of that year, but was so popular that during 1988 he became a full-time cast member as his character became landlord of the Queen Vic pub, buying it from Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) during 1988. The part of Butcher earned Reid the public persona of being pessimistic that he enjoyed acting against, for instance in television adverts for the soft drink Oasis. His character was involved in many popular storylines over the years and the most famous of these storylines was his character's long turbulent relationship with Pat Wicks (played by Pam St. Clement) and later his short-lived marriage to Peggy Mitchell (played by Barbara Windsor)."]}, {"page": "Mo Harris", "response": ["Mo's main link to the square is her former sister-in-law Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement).

Grant sets fire to the pub in 1992 in an insurance scam and it is refurbished. Grant and Sharon divorce in 1995 after her affair with Phil was exposed and their share of The Queen Vic is sold to Grant and Phil's mother, Peggy (Barbara Windsor). Peggy marries Frank in 1999 and he again becomes a landlord. When Grant leaves Walford, Peggy's alcoholic son Phil sells his share of the pub to Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for a mere \u00a35 to spite his domineering mother. However, he subsequently buys back his share and evicts Dan from The Queen Vic. After Frank disappears and leaves her penniless, Peggy is forced to sell the pub in early 2001.

On her getting the part Brooks said, \"It's funny, but for as long as I can remember I knew I was going to make it, I never worried about my career or money, and when I left college I was headstrong and confident and felt very grown. Then I joined EastEnders and I felt like a lost little girl. I remember the casting director taking me to meet Patsy Palmer on my first day there and, because I'd been watching EastEnders since I was little, I actually felt sick\"."]}, {"page": "Pete Beale", "response": ["One of the most notable storylines featuring Pete revolved around the paternity of his alleged son, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). Pete was shell-shocked to discover that Simon, was not really his child, and that he was possibly the son of his brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). The storyline spanned several years, since the arrival of Pete's first wife Pat (Pam St. Clement) in 1986, until the long-awaited showdown between Pete, Pat and Kenny in February 1988. The episode written by Tony McHale contained shocking revelations that would affect several relationships on the Square for years to come. In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal what she thought was the truth, that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father. Despite this revelation on-screen, writer Colin Brake stated in an official EastEnders' book in 1994 that the true parentage of Simon was still uncertain in the minds of the producers. He stated, \"At various times over the years the story has been amended, until the only certainty is that we will never be certain about the actual facts.\" He added that, at the time of writing the book for EastEnders' 10th anniversary in 1994, \"the current producers believe that Pete was the father of [Simon's older brother] David and may have been the father of Simon.\""]}, {"page": "David Wicks", "response": ["David is the son of Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) and her first husband Pete Beale (Peter Dean).

Although it couldn't have been predicted at the time, Frank was perhaps the most important introduction to the series that year, as the popularity of his appearance led to him playing a far greater role the following year. Frank was played by Mike Reid, who was already an established comedian and well known to the British audience. The casting of a comedian in a dramatic role was highly controversial at the time, but over the years the wisdom of that decision was proved, as Frank became one of the show's most popular and iconic characters. His successful casting set a precedent in British soap, and subsequently, many established comedians and comic actors have gone on to play substantial roles in several notable soap operas, including Barbara Windsor, Bradley Walsh, Shane Richie, Bobby Davro and Les Dennis, among others. ", "However, as is customary in EastEnders, their marriage didn't remain happy for long, and after an array of family and monetary problems, Frank began to sink into deep depression.

On-screen his character attempted an insurance scam by having his car-lot torched and was unable to cope with the resulting guilt after the fire claimed the life of a homeless man. Frank disappeared from the show under a cloud of mystery in April 1994 and for a while he was presumed dead, as none of his family had heard anything from him. Pat eventually moved on, and moved in with another man only for Frank to make a shocking return.

His stay was brief, lasting only a few months, but it drew a line under his relationship with Pat and after failing to win her back, Frank was forced to move on too. Frank made several brief appearances in the show after this time, but in May 1998 he made a full-time return, this time as a love interest to Landlady Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). However Frank's affinity with Pat remained an underlying theme for both characters, and despite being separated, viewers were regularly reminded of their lustful connection. Pat's fourth husband Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) was deliberately made impotent in the series, so Pat would not be sexually unfaithful to Frank.\"Interview with Tony Caunter \", Walford Gazette.
