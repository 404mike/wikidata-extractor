Monro was promoted to GOC First Army in Haig's place, not Rawlinson whom Haig would have preferred and for reasons of seniority Haig was forced to accept the weak-willed Launcelot Kiggell, not Butler as chief of staff BEF in succession to Robertson.Groot 1988, pp. 219\u2013220.

In time the two men made a good team.Sheffield 2011, p. 258.

A number of students, of whom the most famous was Archibald Wavell, later contrasted Wilson's expansive lecturing, ranging widely and wittily over geopolitics, with the more practical focus of his successor Robertson. Many of these recollections are unreliable in their details, may well exaggerate the differences between the two men, and may have been influenced by Wilson's indiscreet diaries published in the 1920s.Jeffery 2006, pp. 80\u20131, 83\u20134."]}, {"page": "Lancelot (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Launcelot Kiggell (born 1954), British Army officer"]}, {"page": "Hubert Gough", "response": ["Gough was appointed an Instructor at Staff College on 1 January 1904 and served until 1906.

Haig compromised with a scheme in which XV Corps, with reinforcements, would still attack first but XIII Corps would dig positions on the south slopes of the ridge from Longueval to Bazentin and send patrols forward, ready to attack, if it were feasible, to assist the XV Corps attack against both Bazentin woods and Bazentin le Petit. XV Corps would wheel east, to roll up the defences opposite XIII Corps which would then attack. Rawlinson contacted Haig again on 12 July and his Major-General General Staff (MGGS) Archibald Montgomery, contacted Launcelot Kiggell the BEF Chief of the General Staff, to make a final appeal. Haig gave way, provided that the supporting points were built by XIII Corps and the flanks were protected by garrisons in Mametz and Tr\u00f4nes woods. Most of Mametz Wood had already been captured and the fight for Tr\u00f4nes Wood continued. Haig was also reassured by Major-General Noel Birch the BEF MGRA (Major-General Royal Artillery) that the bombardment was succeeding, that German underground shelters in the second position would be shallower than those overrun on 1 July, that the British had gained artillery superiority and that a dawn attack would mean plenty of time for exploitation."]}, {"page": "History of the Great War", "response": ["Money determined the speed of publication, the size and number of volumes and the choice of author, Edmonds preferring to employ officers on half-pay or retired on \u00a3500 per year, about half the price of a civilian author; officers were usually willing to work longer hours and do unpaid work.

In 1923, it had been decided to prepare the volume out of sequence because of the importance of the failure of the German spring offensive (21 March \u2013 18 July 1918) but by 1926, Kiggell had failed to prepare even a draft narrative for circulation to participants and thought that it would take him another four years to complete the work.

A number of older corps commanders were also retired at this time, freeing up a vacancy for Butler to command III Corps as a temporary lieutenant-general, in place of Pulteney. Unlike his fellow corps commander Ivor Maxse, Butler favoured holding the front line in strength rather than defence in depth, and III Corps bore the brunt of the German Michael Offensive in March 1918.

He told the King that British soldiers (who, in a large conscript army, now included men from \"all classes in the nation, and many are most intelligent\") needed to be told what they were fighting for. In Haig's view, Britain should keep to her original war aims \u2013 the defence of France and liberation of Belgium \u2013 not try to gain Alsace-Lorraine for France or Trieste for Italy. In Haig's view the \"democratising of Germany\", about to be publicly reiterated by Lloyd George as a British aspiration in his Caxton Hall speech (5 January), was likely to destabilise Germany, as the fall of the Tsar in March 1917 had destabilised Russia, and was not \"worth the loss of an Englishman\" (like many Scots of his era, Haig often referred to Britain or even the British Empire as \"England\").Harris 2008 p421", "The purge of Haig's staff continued, with the appointment on 22 January of Herbert Lawrence as BEF Chief of Staff, in place of Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell.
