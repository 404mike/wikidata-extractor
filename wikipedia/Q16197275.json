Nathan sleeps with Ruth (Amy Beth Hayes/Clare Welch) who he discovers has been affected by the storm and is really 82 years old.

During the course of the investigation, it was discovered that Harry Eldridge had indeed murdered Lockhart after he revealed that he had an affair with Eldridge's wife, Julia, and carried out a botched abortion on her that meant she couldn't have children. Harry had tried to kill Julia at their home on the same day but had accidentally died after falling onto the knife he was wielding during a struggle with Tom and Julia, the death subsequently being covered up until the body was discovered 33 years later.
