The \"Gentleman\" listed as the co-writer was Gerald Wiley, the pseudonym used by Ronnie Barker as a comedy writer. The story was originally conceived as a TV special for Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe, and Spike Milligan, to be produced by Peter Eton, their old Goon Show producer. Plans for the project were cancelled due to Peter Sellers' Hollywood commitments. The Phantom finally saw the light of day in an episode of Six Dates with Barker, broadcast on 15 January 1971, with Alan Curtis playing the role of the Phantom. Despite some sources claiming that Milligan provided the raspberry of the title, it was actually Barker's co-star from Open All Hours, David Jason, who was responsible for this sound effect - Jason confirmed this in his 2013 autobiography. One episode featured Ronnie Corbett as the diminutive yet domineering Queen Victoria and Barker as her browbeaten son \"Edward, Prince of Wales\" (in reality the future King Edward VII was known to his family as \"Bertie\"), which was a parody of the recent TV series starring Timothy West."]}, {"page": "Carry On Henry", "response": ["*Alan Curtis as Conte di Pisa"]}, {"page": "Sir Yellow", "response": ["Sir Yellow was a British TV sitcom aired on ITV from 15 July - 19 August 1973.
