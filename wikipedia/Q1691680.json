The character was described by Oberman as being like Angie \"but with 15 more years of feminism behind her\", and was hailed by the TV editor of the Evening Standard as \"the only strong woman left in Walford\". She became well known for her deviousness and \"scheming\", echoing the traits of her husband, with the official EastEnders website characterising her as \"happy to play mind games\" and \"often two steps ahead\" of Den. As part of the Watts family and the last of its major members to have appeared on the show, Chrissie's storylines explored her tumultuous marriage to Den; bonding with his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) and her two half-siblings, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Alice Johnson); conspiring with Den to retake ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; forming a relationship with her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) after Den's murder; attempting to sell the Queen Vic Jake's gangland boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt); being blackmailed by young wayward Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner); and feuding with the rival Mitchell family.

They are initially shocked when the police visit each of the trio on the morning after Den's murder, but it soon transpires that the square's crime kingpin Sam's  ex-husband Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) had died under an alleged suicide that same night; news of Andy's death quickly spread around Walford while Den's murder remains concealed from public knowledge. In response to this, Sam demands Chrissie reinstate the pub's ownership back to the Mitchells in exchange for her silence. During this time, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by alleging that he has run off with another woman. She then manages to make her story convincing to the square by throwing his clothes into the street and then engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. Chrissie soon begins a relationship with Alfie's cousin Jake (Joel Beckett). When Zoe begins to probe Chrissie over the outcome of Den's murder, Chrissie is able to have Zoe leave the Square. However, another setback emerges when Sam takes the doorstop that Chrissie used to kill Den and hides the murder weapon in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth.
