His lyrics aside, he wrote largely in Latin, also being the first to translate Sophocles's Antigone from Greek. His incorporation of Italianate forms into English lyric verse influenced a generation of English writers, including Shakespeare, who was referred to in 1595 by William Covell as \"Watson's heyre\" (heir). He wrote both English and Latin compositions, and was particularly admired for the Latin. His unusual 18-line sonnets were influential, although the form was not generally taken up.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Marlowe", "response": ["It has been speculated that Marlowe was the \"Morley\" who was tutor to Arbella Stuart in 1589.He was described by Arbella's guardian, the Countess of Shrewsbury, as having hoped for an annuity of some \u00a340 from Arbella, his being \"so much damnified (i.e. having lost this much) by leaving the University.\": British Library Lansdowne MS. 71, f.3. and Nicholl, (1992), pp. 340\u20132. This possibility was first raised in a Times Literary Supplement letter by E. St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to Notes and Queries, John Baker has added that only Marlowe could have been Arbella's tutor owing to the absence of any other known \"Morley\" from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied.John Baker, letter to Notes and Queries 44.3 (1997), pp. 367\u20138 If Marlowe was Arbella's tutor, it might indicate that he was there as a spy, since Arbella, niece of Mary, Queen of Scots, and cousin of James VI of Scotland, later James I of England, was at the time a strong candidate for the succession to Elizabeth's throne.Elizabeth I and James VI and I, History in Focus. Frederick S. Boas dismisses the possibility of this identification, based on surviving legal records which document Marlowe's \"residence in London between September and December 1589\". Marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and the poet Thomas Watson in Norton Folgate and was held in Newgate Prison for a fortnight.Frederick S. Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 101ff.

In his 1987 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare (which uses F1 as the control text), G R. Hibbard writes \"exactly when Hamlet was composed depends in part on which Hamlet is under consideration, for the play exists in three different forms.\" Hamlet was originally written sometime between September 1599 and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). The terminus post quem of September 1599 is fixed by a reference to Julius Caesar (3.2.96\u201397), the earliest recorded performance of which took place in September 1599. Another important internal piece of evidence is found in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's report to Hamlet of \"an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't\" (2.2.335\u2013337). This is probably a reference to the Children of the Chapel, a playing company of young boys who performed at Blackfriars with such success as to make them genuine rivals to the adult acting companies. The subsequent comment, \"there has been much to-do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy. There was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in to the question\" (2.2.348\u2013352) is thought to refer to the War of the Theatres between Ben Jonson on one side and John Marston and Thomas Dekker on the other. The conflict began in 1599 when Marston mocked Jonson with the character of Chrisoganus in Histriomastix. Jonson responded by satirizing Marston's style in Every Man out of His Humour, leading to a series of plays in which the various writers mocked one another. The \"conflict\" concluded in 1601, when Dekker mocked Jonson with the character of Horace in Satiromastix, at which point Jonson and Marston apparently reconciled. Both the reference to the child actors and the War of the Theatres suggest a date of composition of 1600\u20131601. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, Gabriel Harvey has written in a marginal note that Shakespeare's \"Lucrece & his tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort.\" Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601. However, not all scholars accept that Harvey's note can be used for dating purposes, mainly due to the fact that it infers Thomas Watson (d.1592) and Edmund Spenser (d.1599) are both still alive, but also mentions John Owen's 1607 epigrams, making it impossible to ascertain exactly when the note was written. Stylistic evidence has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601, with subsequent revisions up to, and possibly beyond, 1605. This dating, however, is far from universally accepted."]}, {"page": "St Bartholomew-the-Less", "response": ["* Thomas Watson, poet: buried 1592"]}, {"page": "Thomas Watson", "response": ["Thomas Watson may refer to:", "*Thomas Watson (bishop of Lincoln) (1515\u20131584), Catholic bishop", "*Thomas Watson (bishop of St David's) (1637\u20131717), English clergyman", "*Thomas Watson (poet) (c. 1557\u20131592), English poet and translator", "*Thomas Watson (Puritan) (c. 1620\u20131686), nonconformist preacher and writer", "*Thomas Watson (engraver) (1750\u20131781), fine engraver", "*Thomas Watson (cricketer, born 1880) (1880\u20131944), English clergyman and cricketer", "*Thomas Watson (cricketer, born 1913) (1913\u20131994), English cricketer and educator", "*Thomas Watson (silk spinner) (1823\u20131887), British politician; MP for Ilkeston, Derbyshire, 1885\u20131887", "*Thomas Watson, 3rd Earl of Rockingham (1715\u20131746), English nobleman and politician; MP for Canterbury", "*Thomas Watson (Berwick-upon-Tweed MP) (c. 1701\u20131766), British politician; MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, 1754\u20131765", "*J.

New York: Washington Square, 2004. Print. Here, Barbara Mowat offers her opinion of the meaning behind Sonnet 130; this work breaks the mold to which Sonnets had come to conform. Shakespeare composed a sonnet which seems to parody a great many sonnets of the time. Poets like Thomas Watson, Michael Drayton, and Barnabe Barnes were all part of this sonnet craze and each wrote sonnets proclaiming love for an almost unimaginable figure;Quennell, P. Shakespeare: the Poet and his Background. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1964. Print Patrick Crutwell posits that Sonnet 130 could actually be a satire of the Thomas Watson poem \"Passionate Century of Love\", pointing out that the Watson poem contains all but one of the platitudes that Shakespeare is making fun of in Sonnet 130.Crutwell, Patrick. The Shakespearean Moment and its Place in the Poetry of the 17th Century. New York:  Random House.  1960. Print However, E.G. Rogers points out the similarities between Watson's \"Passionate Century of Love,\" Sonnet 130, and Richard Linche's Poem collection entitled \"Diella.\"Rogers, E.G., \"Sonnet CXXX:  Watson to Linche to Shakespeare.\"  Shakespeare Quarterly.  11.2 (1960):  232-233.  Print. There is a great deal of similarity between sections of the Diella poem collection and Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 130\", for example in \"130\" we see, \"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head,\" where in \"Diella\" we see \"Her hayre exceeds fold forced in the smallest wire.\"Rogers, E.G., \"Sonnet CXXX:  Watson to Linche to Shakespeare.\"  Shakespeare Quarterly.  11.2 (1960):  232-233.  Print. Each work uses a comparison of hairs to wires; while in modern sense this may seem unflattering, one could argue that Linche's work draws upon the beauty of weaving gold and that Shakespeare mocks this with harsh comparison. This, along with other similarities in textual content, leads, as E.G. Rogers points out, the critic to believe that Diella may have been the source of inspiration for both homage, by Watson's \"Passionate Century of Love,\" and satire by Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 130.\" The idea of Satire is further enforced by the final couplet of \"130\" in which the speaker delivers his most expositional line: \"And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare, as any she belied with false compare.\" This line projects the message behind this work, demeaning the false comparisons made by many poets of the time.Vendler, Helen.
