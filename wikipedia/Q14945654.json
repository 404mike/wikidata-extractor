Both of these writers were born in England, but have Welsh roots and are now Welsh based, and write much on Welsh subject matter. Nikita Lalwani, is originally from Rajasthan in India, but was raised in Wales, and her novel Gifted (2007) was nominated for the Man Booker Prize. Trezza Azzopardi's debut novel The Hiding Place (2000) was also nominated for the Booker Prize, and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, winning the latter. It is the story of the Maltese community in Cardiff. Jan Morris is better known as a non-fiction writer, but she has written some fiction too, her novel Hav won the 2007 Arthur C. Clarke Award. Brian John came to creative writing late, after a career in university teaching and academic research.  His eight-novel Angel Mountain Saga, set in north Pembrokeshire in the Regency and early Victorian period, is effectively a portrayal of \"Mother Wales\" in the persona of the heroine Martha Morgan. He has also written four volumes of Pembrokeshire folk tales, and two other novels.  One of these, written for children, won the Wishing Shelf Award in 2012. John Evans is one of Wales' most uncompromising writers,Welsh writer a former punk rocker, poet, filmmakerThe Acid Real and novelist he has also campaigned against the Badger cull alongside Brian May and other celebrities."]}, {"page": "Little England beyond Wales", "response": ["Although Little England is described by several later writers other than Laws, they do little but quote Owen. Richard Fenton in his Historical Tour of 1810 observed that churches in the south of the county were more likely to have spires than those in the north. Quantitative descriptions of the linguistic geography of the area start with that of Ernst Georg Ravenstein, around 1870.Ravenstein, E. G., On the Celtic languages of the British Isles; a statistical survey, in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society XLII, 1879, 579\u2013636 This shows a further shrinkage since Owen's time. From 1891 onward, linguistic affiliation in Wales has been assessed in the census. The overall picture is that the boundary has moved to a significant, but small degree. Furthermore, the boundary has always been described as sharp. In 1972, Brian John said of the linguistic boundary that it \"is a cultural feature of surprising tenacity; it is quite as discernible, and only a little less strong, than the divide of four centuries ago.\"John, Brian S., The Linguistic Significance of the Pembrokeshire Landsker in The Pembrokeshire Historian 4, 1972. pp. 7\u201329"]}, {"page": "Mynydd Carningli", "response": ["The summit features a large and prominent archeological site; one of the largest hillforts in west Wales. This hillfort, generally dated to the Iron Age and assumed to be from the first millennium BC.  It covers an area of about 4 ha, and is about 400 m x 150 m in extent.  The lower slopes of Carningli are covered with traces of Bronze Age settlement (Pearson 2001) and so some features of the hillfort may be even older. Although not one of the largest fortified sites in Wales, it is certainly one of the most complex, incorporating a series of substantial stone embankments, natural rock cliffs and scree slopes which may have been used as natural defences.  Inside and outside the embankments are terraced enclosures, hut circles and rectangles. Approximately 25 hut circles are at the north east end of the site. On the other side are three enclosures separated by embankments.  Beneath the scree slope on the eastern flank of the mountain are two further massive defensive embankments.  The only plan is that of Hogg 1973 - it has been modified by Figgis, and again in recent research by Brian John. According to Hogg, there are signs that some of the defensive embankments and walls had been intentionally demolished, which he attributed as \"evidence for systematic destruction by Roman invaders in the aftermath of the conquest of Wales\". The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales noted in 2009 that \"Such a dramatic interpretation, placing the Roman legions on the slopes of Carn-ingli in an attack on its inhabitants, might be questioned today\".
