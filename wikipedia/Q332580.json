Stories from this period often included strong a moral message. But it showed signs of growth and some writers decided to seize the opportunity. By the middle of the century, commercial publishers came to recognise the great potential of this market and signed deals with gifted authors to provide a plethora of reading materials to children. They also took advantage of innovations such as those that enable the printing of coloured illustrations. As the middle class boomed, people had more money to spend on entertaining their children. Moral messaging was de-emphasised in favor of fun. Classics like the tales of the Brothers Grimm and the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen made their way to the printing press. But it was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll that proved to be the most popular, alongside the works of William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Kingsley, Jean Ingelow, and George Macdonald. By the 1880s, juvenile fiction packed with action and adventure became commonplace. Fantasy did not have a monopoly on the market for children's literature, however. Tom Brown's School Days (1857) by Thomas Hughes was a noteworthy example of realistic writing and school stories while Black Beauty (1877) by Anna Sewell was the start of the blooming of animal tales. As a matter of fact, the market grew so large that most of the top writers of the era wrote at least one book for children. Children's magazines and poetry for children (especially the nonsensical variety) blossomed during the Victorian age."]}, {"page": "W. G.

However, it was Lewis Carroll's fantasy, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\" and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s. If we follow little Alice in her wanderings in the \"Wonderland\", we will soon see that the fairy-tale absurdity has solid historical ground. With the clear eyes of a child, Lewis Carroll made us look at the various phenomena of contemporary life. The absurd in the fairy tale shows the satire of the author and the embodiment of the serious problems of the Victorian era. Lewis Carroll is ironic about the prim and all-out regulated life of the \"golden\" Victorian century. One other noteworthy publication was Mark Twain's book Tom Sawyer (1876), which was one of the first \"boy books\", intended for children but enjoyed by both children and adults alike. These were classified as such for the themes they contained, consisting of fighting and work.JulJulBulak, History of England in fifteenth century  Another important book of that decade was The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby, by Rev.

Gordon Rayner says that the reason for Jem Mackie's expulsion may have damaged Mackie's reputation so much that Bloxam transferred Mackie's part in inventing Rugby football to Webb Ellis, and that a big donation by Bloxam to Rugby School's library may have influenced school official acceptance of this Webb Ellis version. Another theory is that Mackie's role may have been disregarded because the committee was seeking to prove Rugby School had invented the game, and thus may have preferred the earliest possible date. England Rugby says that William Webb Ellis's action (if it happened) did not lead to any immediate change in the rules but may well have inspired later imitators, though not Mackie, as Thomas Hughes said the Webb Ellis story had not survived into his own time (1834, which was before Mackie popularised running-in during 1838/39)."]}, {"page": "List of years in literature", "response": ["*1857 in literature \u2013 Madame Bovary \u2013 Gustave Flaubert; Little Dorrit \u2013 Charles Dickens; Les Fleurs du mal \u2013 Charles Baudelaire; The Virginians \u2013 William Makepeace Thackeray; Tom Brown's Schooldays \u2013 Thomas Hughes; The Hasheesh Eater \u2013 Fitz Hugh Ludlow; The Professor \u2013 Charlotte Bront\u00eb"]}, {"page": "1857 in literature", "response": ["*Thomas Hughes \u2013 Tom Brown's Schooldays"]}, {"page": "Arthur Penrhyn Stanley", "response": ["He was educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold, and in 1834 went up to Balliol College, Oxford.
