His recent work on global warming has been questioned by environmentalists. His 2009 book Chill: a reassessment of global warming theory argued that most of the recent documented warming is caused by peaking natural cycles, that there is also a potential for global cooling and that adaptation not mitigation should be a priority. His views received widespread coverage in the media \u2013 with front page on the Daily Express, and articles in the online versions of The Times and an Al Jazeera video.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Taylor", "response": ["Peter Taylor may refer to:", "* Peter Taylor (writer) (1917\u20131994), American author, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction", "* Peter Taylor (composer), British composer of television and film soundtrack music", "* Peter Taylor (film editor) (1922\u20131997), English film editor, winner of an Academy Award for Film Editing", "* Peter Taylor (paymaster) (1714\u20131777), British politician, MP for Wells and MP for Portsmouth", "* Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth (1930\u20131997), Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, 1992\u20131997", "* Peter Taylor alias Perce, Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough in 1554", "* Peter Taylor (British politician), Mayor of Watford", "* Peter Taylor (Australian footballer) (born 1954), Australian rules footballer", "* Peter Taylor (Australian cricketer) (born 1956), Australian cricketer", "* Peter Taylor (English cricketer) (born 1942), former cricketer for Bedfordshire", "* Peter Taylor (South African cricketer) (born 1934), South African cricketer", "* Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20131990), English football goalkeeper and manager, associated with Brian Clough", "* Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953) (born 1953), English football manager and former player", "* Peter Taylor (rower) (born 1984), New Zealand Olympic rower", "* Peter Taylor (botanist) (1926\u20132011), British botanist at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew", "* Peter Taylor (journalist) (born 1942), British journalist and author of non-fiction books, especially about Northern Ireland and Al-Qaeda", "* Peter Taylor (environmentalist) (born 1948), British environmentalist", "* Peter Taylor (priest) (born 1944), Archdeacon of Harlow", "* Peter Taylor (General Hospital), a character from the soap opera General Hospital"]}, {"page": "Renewable energy commercialization", "response": ["* Peter Taylor"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with renewable energy", "response": ["*Peter Taylor"]}]}}
