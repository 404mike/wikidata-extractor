FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \"this very readable little book\" as being \"adulatory\" in tone, \"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \"a very great liking\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \"a daemonic energy\", with his accomplishments in India being \"almost superhuman\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire", "response": ["*FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan 27 April 1942 \u2013 14 September 1964"]}, {"page": "F.
