At the completion of the WSL, the rebranded League Cup was played with Nobbs starting the quarter and semi finals and coming on as a sub for Danielle Carter after 69 minutes in the final against Birmingham City which Arsenal won 4\u20131.", "For the third consecutive season, Nobbs featured as Arsenal reached the semi final stage of the Champions League, but once again fell short of the final this time to VfL Wolfsburg. Nobbs scored in the 2013 FA Cup final as Arsenal beat Bristol Academy 3\u20130 at the Keepmoat Stadium. Nobbs was ever present in an ultimately disappointing WSL campaign which saw them fail to qualify for the 2014\u201315 Champions League, although their 2012 WSL win had already qualified them for the 2013\u201314 Champions League.
