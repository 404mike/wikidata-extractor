His research turned established teaching on its head and promoted exercise training (rather than bed rest) as a treatment for chronic heart failure. He was instrumental in describing the \"muscle hypothesis\" of heart failure. In addition to this, Coats is also a successful fundraiser, university administrator, and inventor. His Imperial College patents have formed the basis of companies specialising in the treatment of cachexia (Myotec and PsiOxus).", "link_mentions": []}}
