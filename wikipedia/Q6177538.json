In 1914 Watts was selected to represent Wales as part of the Five Nations Championship. His first game was on the 17 January in a game against England at Twickenham. Under the captaincy of Jenkin Alban Davies, Wales lost the opening game but won the final three games of the tournament. Of all Watts' matches, the most notable was the final game at the Balmoral Showgrounds against Ireland. The game was an overly violent affair, after members of both packs ran into each other the night before the game. The Welsh pack, of which Watts was part off, was named the 'Terrible Eight' by newspapers after the game. Watts played one final game for his country, in an exhibition game against the Barbarians in 1915. Again led by Alban Davies, Watts turned out in the match played to boost recruitment for the Welsh Guards, though the game is not recognised as a full international."]}, {"page": "List of people educated at St John's School, Leatherhead", "response": ["* Jenkin Alban Davies (1885-1976), Wales Rugby International"]}]}}
