The show is a mixture of stand-up, sketches and songs hosted by Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. The show used to feature regular appearances by Jon Holmes, Laura Shavin (earlier series had Emma Kennedy, or occasionally Sue Perkins, for the female voices), a monologue by Marcus Brigstocke, and music by Mitch Benn, Pippa Evans or Adam Kay, but now features a much wider range of contributors.", "The programme is recorded in front of a studio audience on the Thursday evening before the Friday broadcast. On Friday 22 July 2005, The Now Show was broadcast without a studio audience due to the attempted 21 July 2005 London Bombings. The show's then regular venue, The Drill Hall was close to the site of one of the failed bomb attacks and had been cordoned off by police; as such the show had to be recorded in the Radio 4 studios at Broadcasting House. Hugh Dennis opened the show with the words \"with us are Laura Shavin, Jon Holmes, Marcus Brigstocke and Mitch Benn... and no audience\"."]}, {"page": "List of Keeping Up Appearances characters", "response": ["Stephanie (played by Laura Shavin) is Daisy and Onslow's daughter and Hyacinth's niece. Her daughter, Daisy's and Onslow's granddaughter, is named Kylie and is christened in the episode \"The Christening\". Great-Aunt Hyacinth does not approve of the name Kylie, saying it sounds like a foreign vegetable. She also disapproves of the fact that Stephanie had her baby out of wedlock, as do others, though she is the only one to make a point of her disapproval. However, when Stephanie and Kylie don't show up to the christening, Hyacinth and Richard volunteer to search for them and find that Stephanie's caravan is broken down. They also are horrified to discover that she has become a hippie and lives in the caravan with two men, and has no idea which of the two men is Kylie's father. Even the men themselves don't know, and after delivering the trio to the church for the christening, Hyacinth insists she and Richard hide behind a column in the church because she is so ashamed."]}, {"page": "Jake Yapp", "response": ["In 2016 he wrote and presented a series of short, comic histories of scientific knowledge on BBC Radio 4 entitled 'Everything We've Ever Known About...'
