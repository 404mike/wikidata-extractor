He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley from the 1935 general election until the 1959 general election, when he was succeeded by Margaret Thatcher (who later became British Prime Minister).\nCrowder was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He worked as an underwriter and elected a member at Lloyd's of London. He served with the Lincolnshire Yeomanry from 1914 to 1918, when he transferred to the Reserve Regiment of the Royal Horse Guards. He served again during World War II, as a staff captain and army welfare officer.\nCrowder served as a Hampshire County Councillor 1931-46 and a Fleet Urban District Councillor 1933\u201346.

In Parliament, Crowder was an influential member of the 1922 Committee and Second Church Estates Commissioner.\nHis son Petre Crowder also became a Member of Parliament.\nHe appears as a character in The Long Walk to Finchley, on Thatcher's selection to succeed him as Conservative candidate for his seat - he is played, in a less than flattering yet accurate light, by Geoffrey Palmer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Council", "response": ["*Sir John Crowder, member 1931\u20131946"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Crowder"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Crowder"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Palmer (actor)", "response": ["*The Long Walk to Finchley (2008); as John Crowder"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Capt.
