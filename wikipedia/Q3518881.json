He helped the \"Seasiders\" to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1969\u201370, and also featured in the club's Anglo-Italian Cup success in 1971.

As a demonstration of this, over 700 boys were given trials with the club. Centre-half John Nicholson made a club record 208 consecutive appearances before being dropped in favour of Terry Alcock. This unsettled Nicholson, who was soon sold to Doncaster Rovers for \u00a35,000. That money was spent on bringing former Northern Ireland international Jimmy Hill to Vale Park. In a nod to the youth policy, in one game four teenagers made their d\u00e9buts: Alex Donald, Roddy Georgeson, Mick Cullerton and Paul Ogden. At the age of 15 years 347 days, Malcolm MacKenzie made his debut against Newport County on 12 April 1966, the youngest player ever to play for the club. The club finished just two points away from re-election, in 19th position, they could hardly sink any deeper.

The club also 'reluctantly' accepted a \u00a325,000 Blackpool bid for Terry Alcock. Two new signings were Roy Chapman and Mick Morris, both free transfers. The club took a pre-season tour of Czechoslovakia. In November the FA launched an investigation into alleged breaches of rules on payments to players by the club. By January the investigation became a commission, looking charges of weekly wages for 'amateurs', playing schoolboys, extra bonuses for victories, and an illegal signing on bonus and other bonuses paid to John Ritchie, as well as bonuses to Clint Boulton and Gordon Logan, as well as gifts to young players that broke FA rules. In February the club admitted to the charges and were fined \u00a32,000, later doubled, and told that irrespective of where they finished in the table, they would be made to apply for re-election to the Football League at the end of the season. On 8 June they were readmitted to the league by 39 votes to 9. Stanley Matthews 'gradually drifted out of the picture' and Gordon Lee was appointed as manager. It was later revealed that Matthew's left being owed money by the club, which they never paid him, a key reason as to why he never managed in England again.In 1968\u201369, Lee won respect for his 'honesty and enthusiasm' as the club consolidated their league status. Bill Asprey retired to go into coaching in a quiet season for the club. Football hooliganism started to take its grip on the game, and Vale's early experience of it consisted of witnessing the Chester City team coach smashed with bricks. At the end of the season the club were in debt to the tune of \u00a3178,277, with a \u00a310,900 loss being made on the season.

The club had drifted into the bottom four, but a six match unbeaten run with a prolific Cullerton took them to safety. In the background was an ongoing power struggle in the boardroom. In late-March they then received a 6\u20132 beating at Wrexham and then a 4\u20130 beating from Chesterfield at Saltergate. The club suffered an injury crisis in April, with both Keith Chadwick and John Brodie having been forced to retire through injury. Relegation was avoided however with six points from the final five games. The final game of the season was against Rotherham United, who needed a six-goal win margin to gain promotion.
