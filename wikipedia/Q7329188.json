Included in the sale were lathes, milling machines, dies and most notably coin presses of a similar type to those used at the Royal Mint in London. Having had experience in the die making process and noting a lack of any competition Heaton made a decision to purchase the necessary equipment in hopes of taking over the contracts left in the wake of the Soho Mint's demise. A few weeks later on the 29th April the auction was held on-site in the closed Soho Mint. Although no information regarding the bidding process was recorded, documentation from the time shows that Heaton was successful in his bidding and purchased four steam-powered screw presses and six planchet presses which he installed on Bath/Shadwell street. Now with the tools needed to start minting coins, all that was required was governmental permission. Unlike the government-owned Royal Mint which was generally forbidden from producing coins for foreign powers, private mints could be granted special license. Heaton II wrote to his MP Richard Spooner who in turn vouched for Heaton's good character; subsequently permission was given and the new venture could begin."]}, {"page": "Joseph Sturge", "response": ["Sturge then contested Birmingham in 1844 as a Chartist candidate, in a by-election caused by the death of Joshua Scholefield.
