Along with Borrell, the current line-up of the band is composed of founding members Bj\u00f6rn \u00c5gren on guitar and bassist Carl Delemo, as well as drummer Andy Burrows. This lineup is a reunion of the lineup from the band's second and third albums.", "The band was formed in 2002 by Johnny Borrell, after having performed across London with the likes of The Libertines as a solo acoustic singer-songwriter. It is often reported that Borrell was a member of the Libertines, but Carl Barat has since revealed that he was just taught the bass lines for four songs to play for a showcase for Rough Trade Records and failed to turn up for it and never played with the band live. Borrell first enlisted Swedish-born guitarist Bj\u00f6rn \u00c5gren via an advert in the NME, who then introduced fellow-Swede bassist Carl Dalemo to Borrell. Borell then brought in school friend Sh\u00efan (formerly Christian) Smith-Pancorvo on drums, and they rehearsed in east London for six months before playing their first gig on 17 September 2002 at Dingwalls in Camden, London supporting the Von Bondies. Former NME journalist Roger Morton, who had been managing the band from the beginning, began looking to get the band into a recording studio and a session was booked at Liam Watson's Toe Rag Studios to record early versions of the tracks Rip It Up, Rock 'n' Roll Lies and In the City. The results of these sessions gained radio play on the John Kennedy Show on XFM who described the band as being \"the best unsigned band in Britain\", and led to A&R attention. Following a bidding war to sign the band, they signed to Mercury Records.", "On 5 March 2009, it was announced that Andy Burrows had quit the band to \"pursue other musical ventures\". Johnny Borrell stated that although \"over the last two albums and five years Andy has been an integral part of Razorlight and we will miss him\", the band would continue. Burrows initially claimed that his time with the band had been \"an amazing experience\", but later went on to state that he \"hated being in the band. Johnny and I didn't get on. Now I've got my freedom. He never wanted people to know that we both wrote songs\". A well publicised fight between Borrell and Burrows occurred in 2006 at the Hawley Arms in Camden, London over songwriting credits for the song America with it being reported that Burrows was the main songwriter of the song. In 2019, Burrows revealed that he had bumped into Borrell in central London three years prior and was \"brushed off\". He stated that Borrell \"acted like I was a stranger, it was the weirdest thing. I think I went off and got extremely drunk, but felt very weird for a couple of days\u2026 it was almost like seeing a ghost\". In 2016, Borrell admitted that the band were collaborative and that Burrows had helped shape the sound of the second album, stating that \"I rate the drummer Andy Burrows. He was a great drummer with a melodic ear \u2013 but if you want to figure out who was taking Razorlight in which direction, then maybe have a listen to what we're each doing now.
