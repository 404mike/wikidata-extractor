Fenby's professional career started relatively late, as he earned his first professional contract with Newcastle Falcons at the age of 24. After a brief cameo for the Falcons at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he returned to Wales to sign for the Scarlets. The emergence of fellow wing George North on the international scene gave Fenby the opportunity to play regularly for the Scarlets during the Autumn internationals and the Six Nations, before he finally nailed down the left wing position during the 2012\u201313 season. A record of 14 tries in 28 appearances that season resulted in a transfer to London Irish in 2013. After initially retiring from professional rugby at the end of the 2015\u201316 season, he briefly returned to the sport in October 2016, signing a three-month contract with Saracens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rydal Penrhos", "response": ["*Andy Fenby \u2013 Professional rugby player for London Irish"]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle University people", "response": ["* Andy Fenby - rugby player"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Andy Fenby", "|  Andy Fenby"]}, {"page": "Andrew Fenby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Fenby"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Andy Fenby"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Andy Fenby"]}, {"page": "Jordan Williams (rugby union)", "response": ["With the departures of wingers George North and Andy Fenby from the Scarlets after the 2012\u201313 season, Williams found himself back in the Scarlets team for 2013\u201314, albeit out of position. After being named on the bench for the first game of the season against Leinster, Williams started seven of the next eight games on the left wing, followed by one on the right, scoring tries in the league against Edinburgh and in the Heineken Cup against Harlequins, sandwiching a penalty against Glasgow Warriors. As he had been included in the Wales squad for the 2013 Autumn internationals, he missed the next two games for the Scarlets, but returned to the side as a replacement for the return fixture against Leinster on 30 November, before starting both matches against Clermont in the Heineken Cup; he kicked a penalty in the away fixture, but also missed a conversion. After missing the last two matches of the year against Munster and the Ospreys, Williams was a replacement for the Scarlets' first two games of 2014 (going unused in the Heineken Cup against Racing M\u00e9tro), before starting each of the remaining games of the season, either on the left wing or at full-back. In February 2014, he scored three tries in two games, starting with the final score in a 41\u201333 win over Benetton, before scoring twice in a 25\u201321 win at home to Edinburgh. He scored twice more in the final four games of the season, first in the 27\u201320 home win over Zebre on 12 April, and then in the 34\u201323 bonus-point win at home to the Dragons that secured the Scarlets' place in the 2014\u201315 European Rugby Champions Cup."]}, {"page": "Fenby", "response": ["*Andy Fenby (born 1985), Welsh rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG/FB||align=\"left\"| Andy Fenby"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 LV Cup", "response": ["|align=left| Andy Fenby ||align=left|  Scarlets"]}, {"page": "List of 2013\u201314 Premiership Rugby transfers", "response": ["* Andy Fenby from  Scarlets "]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 LV Cup", "response": ["|align=left| Andy Fenby ||align=left|  Scarlets"]}, {"page": "List of 2016\u201317 RFU Championship transfers", "response": ["* Andy Fenby retired"]}]}}
