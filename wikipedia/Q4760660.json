Fenby's professional career started relatively late, as he earned his first professional contract with Newcastle Falcons at the age of 24. After a brief cameo for the Falcons at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he returned to Wales to sign for the Scarlets. The emergence of fellow wing George North on the international scene gave Fenby the opportunity to play regularly for the Scarlets during the Autumn internationals and the Six Nations, before he finally nailed down the left wing position during the 2012\u201313 season. A record of 14 tries in 28 appearances that season resulted in a transfer to London Irish in 2013. After initially retiring from professional rugby at the end of the 2015\u201316 season, he briefly returned to the sport in October 2016, signing a three-month contract with Saracens.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
