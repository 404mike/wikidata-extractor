The loss of no less than six of the playoff-chasing side of the previous season was a tough act to follow. Following a shaky start to the season the arrival of Bryan Hughes in October transformed the club's fortunes. A run of 6 wins in 7 games over the Christmas period saw the club briefly enter the play-offs. However, following the sale of club captain Andrew Procter to Preston North End in the January 2012 transfer window, the third-longest serving management team of John Coleman and Jimmy Bell departed for Rochdale. Former Burnley and club favourite Paul Cook was brought in as manager, along with the promotion of Leam Richardson from caretaker manager to full-time assistant. Only 3 wins in the final 17 games of the season was a pretty poor finish the season. However, this meant the club achieved a solid mid-table finish in 14th position. In terms of the domestic cups Stanley exited both the League Cup and FA Cup at the 1st round stages, losing to Scunthorpe United and Notts County respectively. The club reached the second round of the Football League Trophy, after knocking out holders Carlisle United, but lost to Tranmere Rovers in the 2nd round after an eventual replay. This was following a serious head injury to young defender Thomas Bender in the initial tie."]}, {"page": "Luke Joyce", "response": ["On 25 June 2009, Joyce signed with League Two club Accrington Stanley. He made 50 appearances in the 2009\u201310 season, scoring one goal. He featured 32 times in the 2010\u201311 campaign, helping \"Accy\" to reach the League Two play-offs for the first time, before they were beaten by Stevenage at the semi-final stage. He scored three goals in 47 matches as Stanley finished in 14th-place under the stewardship of Paul Cook at the end of the 2011\u201312 season; Joyce took over as captain following the departure of Andrew Procter in January 2012. He made 48 appearances across the 2012\u201313 campaign, with Stanley ending up in 18th-place under new boss Leam Richardson. Joyce played 49 games in the 2013\u201314 season as Accrington posted a 15th-place finish under the stewardship of rookie manager James Beattie. When the club were bottom of the English Football League in November after failing to win in their first 12 league games, Joyce stood by Beattie, calling him a \"good manager and a good bloke\". Two months later Beattie returned the favour by calling Joyce an \"unsung hero\" after he scored his first goal in 22 months to help secure a 2\u20131 victory over Cheltenham Town. John Coleman returned as manager early in the 2014\u201315 campaign and kept Joyce as captain, with the midfielder scoring four goals from 50 appearances. Joyce said \"it has been an up and down season... overall, I guess it has been a decent season, we have secured our tenth season in the Football League and that's a massive achievement for the club the size of ours, but we are disappointed we haven't finished further up the league\"."]}, {"page": "Procter", "response": ["* Andrew Procter (cricketer) (born 1968), English cricketer", "* Andrew Procter (born 1983), British association football player for Accrington Stanley F.
