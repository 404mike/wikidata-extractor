He was correspondent of The Times at the coronation of Alexander II of Russia, in the camp of the insurgents at Warsaw (1862\u201363), and at German army headquarters during the Franco-Prussian War. \nIn 1865 he took over the role of chief music critic on The Morning Post from Howard Glover and he was a regular contributor to The Pall Mall Gazette.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eugene Onegin (opera)", "response": ["The first performance in England took place on 17 October 1892 at the Olympic Theatre in London with Henry J.

Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece.\" Similar reports continued to appear through early March, when Thespis closed. The final performance during the authors' lifetimes was given less than two months later, on 27 April, at a matin\u00e9e for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at \"inflated prices\".Rees, pp. 81\u201382. The actress was a Gaiety favourite, \"not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure.\"Rees, p. 14. Others recalled \"the charm of Mlle. Clary, with her pretty face and piquant broken English\".Walbrook, p. 34. She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion,Allen (First Night), p. 5; Walbrook, chapter II; The Observer, 31 December 1871 and her song in Act II, \"Little Maid of Arcadee\", was the only one chosen for publication."]}, {"page": "James Hannay", "response": ["From 1846 onwards till his appointment as consul in 1868, Hannay worked on the press and at literature. His first engagement was as a reporter on the Morning Chronicle, in which capacity he relied more on his remarkable memory than on his knowledge of shorthand. In the meantime, he was reading zealously in the British Museum. At the end of 1847, he worked with Henry Sutherland Edwards on Pasquin, a very short-lived comic paper, and the forerunner of the somewhat happier Puppet Show, which lasted from 1848 to 1849."]}, {"page": "Angelica Catalani", "response": ["* Henry Sutherland Edwards, The Prima Donna: Her History and Surroundings from the Seventeenth to the Nineteenth Century, volume i (two volumes, London, 1888)  "]}, {"page": "The Graphic", "response": ["When it began in 1869, the newspaper was printed in a rented house.
