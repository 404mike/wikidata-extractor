His works there include St Peter and St Sigfrid's Church in Stockholm, known locally as the \"English Church\", which was moved, stone by stone, to its present location in the \u00d6stermalm area of the city in 1913.\nAnother building that takes place in Souttar's portfolio was the St. Nicholas Congregational Church in Aberdeen. Records say the building was erected in 1865, whilst the circular stained glass windows which are still intact say 1869. The building in 2001 was in a deteriorating, derelict state when Aberdeen bar and nightclub operators, The Epic Group bought the building.
