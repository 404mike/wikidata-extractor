Morrison of the University of Wisconsin-Madison describes McGlinchey as earning \"a personal reputation for sheer readiness to murder that no single republican figure of the Troubles has come close to challenging\". A lieutenant general in the British Army, Maurice Robert Johnston, later described McGlinchey as a \"lunatic\", and more of an enemy to the British government than Martin McGuinness. McGlinchey not only lacked McGuinness's restraint, said Johnston, but would \"shoot his own mother and all the rest of it\". McGlinchey's \"Mad Dog\" nickname was given him by the security services\u2014the modern historian Ru\u00e1n O'Donnell calls the term a \"pejorative soubriquet\"\u2014who considered him a \"psycho\". Dillon suggests that, in reality, the army did not consider him a mad dog but a \"committed terrorist who had proved...dangerous and unpredictable\", while the investigative journalist Mark Urban says McGlinchey had \"driven the INLA into active and reasonably effective terrorism\". The former INLA Chief of Staff\u2014who McGlinchey had failed to re-recruit in the late 1970s\u2014later told how he was ultimately deterred when he considered the direction McGlinchey wanted to take the group in. Holland and Mcdonald tell how\u2014the two men having shared a cell in Portlaoise for some time\u2014the ex-chief considered McGlinchey to be \"unpredictable\", and that his involvement increased the likelihood of a bloodbath at some point. A Garda who knew McGlinchey during his last term of imprisonment said that notwithstanding the urbane, academic facade McGlinchey adopted, he was still \"a complete dictator\" who wanted to dominate all around him."]}, {"page": "1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards", "response": ["*1986\u20131991: Lt Gen.
