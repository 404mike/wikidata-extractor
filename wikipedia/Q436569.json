He is principally known for his work on the origin and nature of itinerant ferromagnetism (the type of ferromagnetic behaviour associated with pure transition metals like cobalt, nickel, and iron), including the collective electron theory of ferromagnetism and the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. Stoner made significant contributions to the electron configurations in the periodic table.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chandrasekhar limit", "response": ["In 1926, the British physicist Ralph H. Fowler observed that the relationship between the density, energy, and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained  by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei that obey Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics.  This Fermi gas model was then used by the British physicist Edmund Clifton Stoner in 1929 to calculate the relationship among the mass, radius, and density of white dwarfs, assuming they were homogeneous spheres. Wilhelm Anderson applied a relativistic correction to this model, giving rise to a maximum possible mass of approximately . In 1930, Stoner derived the internal energy\u2013density equation of state for a Fermi gas, and was then able to treat the mass\u2013radius relationship in a fully relativistic manner, giving a limiting mass of approximately  (for ).  Stoner went on to derive the pressure\u2013density equation of state, which he published in 1932.  These equations of state were also previously published by the Soviet physicist Yakov Frenkel in 1928, together with some other remarks on the physics of degenerate matter..  Frenkel's work, however, was ignored by the astronomical and astrophysical community."]}, {"page": "List of theoretical physicists", "response": ["* Edmund Clifton Stoner (1899\u20131968)"]}, {"page": "Stoner", "response": ["* Edmund Clifton Stoner (1899\u20131968), theoretical physicist"]}, {"page": "Stoner exchange interaction", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edmund Clifton Stoner"]}, {"page": "Edmund Stoner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edmund Clifton Stoner"]}, {"page": "Edmund C.

A recommendation from Tyndall and an interview with Professor Edmund Clifton Stoner at the University of Leeds garnered Eichholz admittance to Leeds as a second-year physics student in the midst of an accelerated wartime curriculum. In May 1942, he graduated with First-Class Honours in physics. James Chadwick was the external examiner.

Since the 1990s, he has published numerous works on the history of science, especially about physicists from the 17th century. Among them are works on the work of Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens.
