Parker only states that the game is played in the same way as in Hat diviyan keliya which is also a leopard game played in Sri Lanka but with less pieces and points on the board.  In Hat Diviyan Keliya, the single tiger piece is comparable to the three leopard pieces in Demala diviyan keliya as they are the side that can perform captures, and the single tiger piece is placed on the apex of the triangle board.  The fifteen dog pieces are set beside the board.", "*Assuming all three leopard pieces are already on the board, the Leopards on its turn may either move one of its pieces onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board, or capture a dog piece by the short leap.  In capturing a dog by the short leap, the leopard must be adjacent to the dog, and leap over it (in a straight line and following the pattern of the board) landing on a vacant point immediately beyond.Henry Parker writes \"Capturing the Dogs is termed 'chopping' them (v. kotanaw\u0101)\"  The captured dog piece is removed from the board.  Only one capture is allowed in a turn.  Captures are not compulsory."]}, {"page": "Vedda language", "response": ["The first systematic attempt at studying the Vedda language was undertaken by Hugh Neville, an English civil servant in British Ceylon. He founded The Taprobanian, a quarterly journal devoted to the study of everything Ceylonese. He speculated, based on etymological studies, that Vedda is based on an Old Sinhalese form called Hela.  His views were followed by Henry Parker, another English civil servant and the author of Ancient Ceylon (1909), who wrote that most Vedda words were borrowed from Sinhalese, but he also noted words of unique origin, which he assigned to the original language of the Veddas. The second most important study was made in 1935 by Wilhem Geiger, who also sounded the alarm that Vedda would be soon be extinct and needed to be studied in detail. One of the linguists to heed that call was Manniku W. Sugathapala De Silva who did a comprehensive study of the language in 1959 as a PhD thesis, which he published as a book: according to him, the language was restricted to the older generation of people from the Dambana region, with the younger generation shifting to Sinhalese, whereas Coast Veddas were speaking a dialect of Sri Lankan Tamil that is used in the region. During religious festivals, people who enter a trance or spirit possession sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from Vedda.Vedars or Coast Veddas consider themselves and are considered by the Sri Lankan Tamils as a caste ( or  in Tamil), rather than an ethnic group.  Nevertheless there is considerable debate amongst Vedars and their Tamil neighbors to their status within the caste system, Vedars claiming very high status and their neighbors assigned somewhat lower status. Vedars use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect peculiar to that region called Batticaloa Tamil dialect in their day to day conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. But during religious ( in Tamil) ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call  ('Vedar Sinhala') or  ('Vedar language') which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas.  is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. At some point in the past that the people were bilingual in Vedda and Tamil, but that is no longer the case. Veddas of the Anuradhapura region speak in Sinhalese, but use Vedda words to denote animals during hunting trips.In the late 1800s, Veddas of Anuradhapura did not identify themselves as Veddas to Parker and other British ethnologists. They self identified themselves as Vanniyas or people of the forest. But to James Brow an anthropologists who studied them in the 1970s they readily identified themselves as Veddas. Parker recorded number of hunting terms used by the Vanniyas that were similar to what the Veddas of Bintanne region used."]}, {"page": "Sri Lankan irrigation network", "response": ["Henry Parker, Ancient Ceylon, London-Luzca & Co., First Published by the India Office (1909)", "*Henry Parker"]}, {"page": "Xavier Romero Fr\u00edas", "response": ["Dr Roland Silva, the Director of the Archaeology Department of Sri Lanka between 1983 and 1992 compared the pioneering work of Romero Fr\u00edas with that of Henry Parker, a British anthropologist who compiled the folk tales of the villages of Sri Lanka around 1880."]}, {"page": "Daramutu", "response": ["Daramutu is a traditional mancala game from Sri Lanka.

He also suggested that a flying horse, either of wax or wood, appears in ancient Indian literature (e.g., the Rig Veda), and may date from before the time of Christ. He also saw two possible routes of diffusion: either the tale developed in India or in Sri Lanka, and was diffused by Arabs; or the image of a winged quadruped, attested in old Assyria and Mesopotamia, \"spread to the early Aryans\".Parker, Henry.

In this tale, two noblemen live in two houses in the same city. Their respective wives bear seven children each: one gives birth to seven daughters, and the othe to six boys and a turtle. Both men decide to marry their children to each other, but there is the problem of the seventh couple: how can his daughter marry a turtle? The man relents and authorizes his daughter's marriage. Some time later, the king of the same city announces that whoever brings him the Fire Cock (Gini kukul\u0101, or fire[-coloured] cock) from the Land of the Rakshasas shall receive the kingdom. The turtle prince asks his mother to go to the king and offer his services. The turtle prince cooks a bit of rice and goes on the journey. On the road, he hides behind some trees and takes off his \"turtle jacket\". He takes shelter with three old women in his quest for the \"Jewelled Cock\", but each warns him many have tried and failed. Since he insists on soldiering on, the widow-mothers teach him magic and give him magic objects to create obstacles for the Rakshasas, should they pursue him after he gets the bird. The prince gets the bird and use the magical items to hinder the pursuing Rakshasas. He goes back to the trees, puts the turtle jacket on and returns to the kingdom with the Fire Cock. Having succeeded, the turtle prince takes off his jacket and goes to hear the Bana with his wife. The wife, noticing the man is her husband, rushes home to burn the turtle jacket and keep her husband in human form definitively.Parker, Henry. Village folk-tales of Ceylon. Volume 3.
