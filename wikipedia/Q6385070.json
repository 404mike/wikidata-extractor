Stevens was nicknamed \"Rhino\" by his teammates, although it is unclear if this was due to his fearless tackling style or the size of his nose. He gained a regular first team place two seasons later and helped Millwall reach the Second Division in 1985 and the First Division (for the first time) in 1988. He helped them finish 10th in their first top division season, and even after their relegation the following year he was able to bolster their defence and ensure that they were at least a match for most other second-tier teams. In 1994, he was ever-present in the league as they finished third, but lost out on a place in the Premier League due to a playoff defeat at the hands of Derby County in the semi-finals. Millwall were relegated to Division Two in 1996, and although Stevens was no longer a regular first team player after this stage he continued as a player for another three seasons.\nStevens was appointed player-manager of Millwall in May 1998 on the dismissal of Billy Bonds, and named teammate Alan McLeary as his co-manager. They remained in charge until their controversial dismissal on 17 September 2000 after failing to get Millwall promoted back to Division One, a feat which was achieved eight months later under successor Mark McGhee, with the team that Stevens and McLeary had built.\nDespite no longer being with the club, in April 2001 Millwall awarded Stevens a testimonial, culminating in a friendly with Tottenham Hotspur in August 2001.Stevens later managed non-league Fisher Athletic until resigning in July 2002.Keith Stevens and his family emigrated to Australia.He is the current assistant coach of the inaugural championship winning club Brisbane Roar in the Australian women's W-League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ray Harford", "response": ["In the summer of 1999, Harford made a return to football as first team coach under then Millwall manager Keith Stevens. Millwall had been in Division Two since 1996 and the club's directors were desperate to win promotion. Stevens was young and inexperienced, and by September 2000 the Millwall board had decided they wanted a more experienced manager so they terminated his contract. Harford was appointed manager on a temporary basis and it seemed possible that he might be given the job permanently. But that fifth promotion from within never happened and Mark McGhee was given the job instead. Harford remained on the club's coaching staff and was crucial in Millwall's Division Two championship that season which ended a five-year exile from the upper tier of the English league."]}, {"page": "Rhino (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Rhino, a nickname of English former footballer Keith Stevens"]}, {"page": "Millwall F.C.", "response": ["Mark McGhee was named as Millwall's new manager in September 2000, and eight months later the club won promotion as Division Two champions, with the team built by Keith Stevens, after five years in the third tier of the league. They finished with 93 points, a club record. Winning the first match of the 2001\u201302 season 4\u20130 at home to Norwich City set the team up well for a good year, in which Millwall qualified for the Division One play-offs, but lost to eventual winners Birmingham City 2\u20131 in the semi-finals.

McGhee swiftly won the Division Two title in his first season and led the club to the Division One play-offs in the following campaign.

His time at the Molineux was less successful than it was at Elm Park, scoring just once in 38 league appearances, though he did come close to reaching the Premier League with them just as he had done at Reading. He joined Wolves just weeks before the end of the 1996\u201397 season, as they were edged out of the automatic promotion places to Barnsley and lost to Crystal Palace in the playoffs. A year later they finished ninth, missing out on the playoffs, but enjoyed a run to the FA Cup semi finals where they narrowly lost to Arsenal."]}]}}
