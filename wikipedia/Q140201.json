In the late 1960s, he produced a variety of experimental short stories (or \"condensed novels\"), such as those collected in the controversial The Atrocity Exhibition (1970). In the mid-1970s, Ballard published several novels, among them the highly controversial Crash (1973), a story about car crash fetishism, and High-Rise (1975), a depiction of a luxury apartment building's descent into violent chaos.\nWhile much of Ballard's fiction would prove thematically and stylistically provocative, he became best known for his war novel, Empire of the Sun (1984), a semi-autobiographical account of a young British boy's experiences in Shanghai during Japanese occupation. Described by The Guardian as \"the best British novel about the Second World War\", the story was adapted into a 1987 film by Steven Spielberg starring Christian Bale and John Malkovich. The author's journey from youth to mid-age would be chronicled, with fictional inflections, in The Kindness of Women (1991) and in direct autobiography in Miracles of Life (2008). In the following decades until his death in 2009, Ballard's work shifted toward the form of the traditional crime novel. Several of his earlier works have been adapted into films, including David Cronenberg's controversial 1996 adaptation of Crash and Ben Wheatley's 2015 adaptation of High-Rise.\nThe literary distinctiveness of Ballard's fiction has given rise to the adjective \"Ballardian\", defined by the Collins English Dictionary as \"resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments\".

In the United States, Harlan Ellison's 1967 anthology Dangerous Visions is viewed as the best representation of the genre; J. G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss were also principal writers within the movement. The New Wave was a period marked by the emergence of a greater diversity of voices in science fiction, most notably the rise in the number of female writers, including Joanna Russ, Ursula K. Le Guin and Alice Bradley Sheldon (using the pseudonym James Tiptree, Jr.).", "The science fiction academic Edward James pointed out differences between the British and American SF New Wave. He believed that the former was, through J. G. Ballard and Michael Moorcock, mainly associated with a specific magazine with a set programme that had little subsequent influence. James further noted that even the London-based American writers of the time, such as Samuel R. Delany, Thomas M. Disch, and John Sladek, had their own agendas. James asserted the American New Wave did not reach the status of a movement but was rather a confluence of talent arising simultaneously that introduced new ideas and better standards to the authoring of science fiction, including through the first three seasons of Star Trek. In his opinion, \"...the American New Wave ushered in a great expansion of the field and of its readership... it is clear that the rise in literary and imaginative standards associated with the late 1960s contributed a great deal to some of the most original writers of the 1970s, including John Crowley, Joe Haldeman, Ursula K. Le Guin, James Tiptree, Jr., and John Varley.\":176", "The New Wave interacted with a number of themes in the 1960s and 1970s, including sexuality; drug culture, especially the work of William S. Burroughs and the use of psychedelics; and the rise of the environmental movement. J. G. Ballard's themes included alienation, social isolation, class discrimination through social isolation, and the end of civilization, in settings ranging from a single apartment block (High Rise) to whole worlds. Rob Latham noted that several of J. G. Ballard's works in the 1960 (e.g., the quartet begun by the 1960 novel The Wind from Nowhere), engaged with the concept of eco-catastrophe, as did Disch's The Genocides and Ursula K. Le Guin's short novel The Word for World is Forest. The latter, in its use of napalm on the indigenous people, was also influenced by Le Guin's perceptions of the Vietnam War, and both emphasized anti-technocratic fatalism instead of imperial hegemony via technology, with the New Wave going on to interact with feminism, ecological activism and postcolonial struggles. A central concern of the New Wave was a fascination with entropy, i.e., that the world (and the universe) must tend to disorder, to eventually run down to 'heat death'. The New Wave also engaged with utopia, a common theme in science fiction, offering much more nuanced interpretations, on a 'soft' rather than 'hard' science fiction basis.:74-80", "Concerning visual aspects, some scenes in J. G. Ballard's novels reference the surrealist paintings of Max Ernst and Salvador Dal\u00ed.", "The New Wave was in part a rejection of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Algis Budrys in 1965 wrote of the \"recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940s\u2014the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface\". The New Wave did not define itself as a development from the science fiction which came before it, but initially reacted against it. New Wave writers did not operate as an organized group, but some of them felt the tropes of the pulp and Golden Age periods had become worn out, and should be abandoned: J. G. Ballard stated in 1962 that \"science fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extra-terrestrial life forms, (and) galactic wars\", and Brian Aldiss said in Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction that \"the props of SF are few: rocket ships, telepathy, robots, time travel...like coins, they become debased by over-circulation.\" Harry Harrison summarised the period by saying \"old barriers were coming down, pulp taboos were being forgotten, new themes and new manners of writing were being explored\".", "New Wave writers began to look outside the traditional scope of science fiction for influence; some looked to the example of beat writer William S. Burroughs \u2013 New Wave authors Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer and Barrington J. Bayley wrote pastiches of his work (The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod and The Four Colour Problem, respectively), while J. G. Ballard published an admiring essay in an issue of New Worlds.Ballard, J.

Predicting that Zelazny's career would be more important and lasting than Disch's, he described the latter's book as \"unflaggingly derivative of\" the New Wave and filled with \"dumb, resigned victims\" who \"run, hide, slither, grope and die\", like Ballard's The Drowned World but unlike The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (\"about people who do something about their troubles\"). Writing in The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of, Disch observed that \"Literary movements tend to be compounded, in various proportions, of the genius of two or three genuinely original talents, some few other capable or established writers who have been co-opted or gone along for the ride, the apprentice work of epigones and wannabes, and a great deal of hype.

The novel was written as a straight narrative and then chopped up into a more random pattern, leaving the reader to sort through the characters and events. This technique differed from the author's earlier cut-up methods, which were accidental from the start. Nevertheless, the novel was reassembled and published, still without a straight linear form, but with fewer breaks in the story. The trilogy featured time-travel adventures in which Burroughs' narrators rewrote episodes from history to reform mankind. Reviews were mixed for Cities. Novelist and critic Anthony Burgess panned the work in Saturday Review, saying Burroughs was boring readers with repetitive episodes of pederast fantasy and sexual strangulation that lacked any comprehensible world view or theology; other reviewers, like J.

The band sampled the drum track with a sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, inspired by the music of DJ Shadow, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The song's references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled \"An Airbag Saved My Life\" and The Tibetan Book of the Dead.

Ballard, especially his 1973 novel Crash, on the lyrics. Music journalist Tim Footman noted that the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrated the \"key paradox\" of the album: \"The musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact ... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums.\""]}, {"page": "Will Self", "response": ["Self was a voracious reader from a young age.
