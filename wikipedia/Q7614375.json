He again wasted no time in installing Yorath as his assistant. With only eight players turning up to his first training session, and star player Martin Smith defecting to Northampton Town, many supporters would have been happy to see the side consolidate and not slip any further down the league. But some shrewd signings (including Rob Edwards, Tony Carss, Efe Sodje, Steve Yates and goalkeeper Ian Gray), the emergence of a talented group of youngsters, and the prolific form of the previously ineffective Jon Stead made Town among the early pace-setters for the Division. As winter approached, Jackson's young side became more inconsistent and seemed to be fading but a change of formation tightened up the defence. Goalkeeper Paul Rachubka was brought in as the side found a new resilience and the ability to grind out narrow victories. Stead's form saw an offer from Sunderland, that was rejected, but he was snapped up by Premiership Blackburn Rovers for around \u00a31.2\u00a0million in January and was replaced by Polish U21 striker Pawel Abbott who had been unable to establish himself at Preston North End.", "|5||Steve Yates||||DF||35||1||0||0||3||0||0||0||3||0||41||1"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|5||Steve Yates||||DF||15 (2)||0||1||0||0||0||1||0||17 (2)||0"]}, {"page": "Adam Yates (footballer)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"|Morecambe||2006\u201307 (Soccerbase erroneously credited namesake Steve Yates with Adam's appearances during the 2006\u201307 season)||Conference National||45||2||2||0||0||0||4||0||51||2"]}, {"page": "Brian Dutton", "response": ["The 2017-18 season saw Dutton promoted to first team duties in late December 2017, standing in for long-time first team coach Steve Yates."]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Steve Yates||||2003\u20132005||50 (2)||1||1||0||3||0||1||0||3||0||58 (2)||1"]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||4||Steve Yates", "|DF ||4||Steve Yates"]}, {"page": "2004 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||5 ||Steve Yates"]}, {"page": "Des Bulpin", "response": ["Des Bulpin has a solid record of identifying and developing young players such as Peter Crouch, Danny Dichio, Dougie Freedman, Kevin Gallen, Ledley King, Marcus Stewart, Steve Yates and many more. \"Des Bulpin discovered me and along with my dad would be the biggest influence on my career,\" Peter Crouch says. \"I remember him telling me when I was 15 that Jermain Defoe and I would play together for England when we were older and he hasn't been too far wrong.
