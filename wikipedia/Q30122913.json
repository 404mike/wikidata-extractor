Lieber confessed he had no knowledge of Ramanujan, when he signed the film, and went as far as to meet B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s, who worked with Littlewood personally, for his research work. He found it difficult to speak the Tamil lines, but appreciated it later on, \"I would be lying if I said that the task of learning Tamil was not daunting at first, but once I got the hang of it I was able to appreciate what a beautiful language it is. There were many different ways of learning the Tamil lines; some used audio tapes, prompting, flash cards, or word boards. I learnt the meaning of the words and memorised chunks of dialogue.\" Similarly, Kevin McGowan, who was signed for the role of G. H. Hardy, was unfamiliar with the story of Ramanujan.
