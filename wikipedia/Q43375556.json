Webb (1853 - 1917) was a British Classic winning jockey. \nWebb was apprenticed to trainer Mathew Dawson at Heath House, Newmarket. His first major victory was the 1869 Cesarewitch Handicap on Cherie. He finished the season with 27 wins. His 1873 Derby win on James Merry's Doncaster was unexpected. He was only booked for the ride on the morning of the race because the intended jockey James Snowden was too drunk. Later in 1873, he won the Middle Park Stakes on Newby. \nIn 1877 his six wins included the Northumberland Plate, the Goodwood Cup and the Doncaster Cup on Hampton. \nWebb's other Classic success came in 1881 with Peregrine in the 2,000 Guineas. A few weeks previously, he had finished fifth in the Grand National on The Scot. In 1884, he won the Cambridgeshire on Florence. For the Derby, Webb again partnered Peregrine, although friend and fellow jockey, Fred Archer tried to steal the ride, approaching the trainer, Robert Peck, saying \"give Webb a thousand and put me up\". In the event, Archer on Iroquois, which was second in the Guineas, beat Webb and Peregrine by a neck.He won two successive runnings of the Champion Stakes on Tristan - outright in 1883 and dead-heating in 1884. \nHe was a stylish rider and a strong finisher. A long face and prominent nose gave him a lugubrious appearance.Webb began training in 1895 for Lillie Langtry, Lord Shrewsbury and others at Ethelreda House, Newmarket, shortly before weight gain meant he had to give up race riding. For Langtry, he won the 1897 Cesarewitch with Merman. Later, he went to Hungary to train for Prince Victor of Thurn and Taxis. He died of diabetes in Eastbourne in 1917.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| Fred Webb"]}, {"page": "George Webb (cricketer)", "response": ["Webb's brother, Arthur Webb, almost eleven years his junior, played for Hampshire County Cricket Club between 1895 and 1904, scoring over 5,000 runs in 49 first-class matches for the side.

Another brother Fred Webb was a well known jockey, winning the Epsom Derby on Doncaster in 1873 after the original jockey engaged was found to be drunk before the race.

On 4 May 1881 Peregrine, on his racecourse debut, was one of fourteen horses to contest the 73rd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Prince Soltykoff's Scobell started the 7/2 ahead of Cameliard, Golden Plover and Tristan with Peregrine, ridden by Fred Webb next in the betting on 15/2. The filly Wandering Nun delayed the start by refusing to line up with her male opponents but started well and led the field before giving way to Lennoxlove who was in turn overtaken by the American-bred outsider Iroquois two furlongs from the finish. Peregine, who had not been among the early leaders moved into contention at about the same stage and then began to make rapid progress down the centre of the course. He moved up alongside the American colt approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win \"very easily\" by three lengths from the American-bred Iroquois with the 100/1 outsider Don Fulano finishing a length and a half back in third."]}, {"page": "Fred Webb (jockey)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Webb"]}]}}
