He is elected Mayor of Gotham with the reluctant help of Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin, whom he blackmails into killing the other mayoral candidates by holding his mother, Gertrude, hostage. When Galavan's assassin sister, Tabitha kills Gertrude anyway, Cobblepot swears revenge and enters a tenuous alliance with Detective Jim Gordon to bring Galavan down.

In \"Wrath of the Villains: Pinewood\", Galavan under the alias of \"Patient 44\" is revived by Hugo Strange. Strange's experiments warp Galavan's mind, however; he has no memory of his past life, and believes himself to be Azrael, an ancient immortal warrior who vanquished the Order's enemies. Strange takes advantage of Galavan's delusions by ordering \"Azrael\" to kill Gordon, gifting him a sword, mask and medieval armor. Galavan attacks the Gotham City Police Department, killing several police officers and wounding its captain, Nathaniel Barnes. In \"Wrath of the Villains: Unleashed\", Galavan is poised to finally kill Gordon, Alfred and Bruce Wayne at Wayne Manor, when Cobblepot and his henchman Butch Gilzean blow him up with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.Gotham EP Promises Comics-Accurate Azrael in Second Half of Season 2"]}, {"page": "1999 in British music", "response": ["*January \u2013 The film Hilary and Jackie, starring Emily Watson and James Frain as Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 and Daniel Barenboim, is released."]}, {"page": "Shadowlands (1993 film)", "response": ["* James Frain as Peter Whistler"]}, {"page": "The Buccaneers", "response": ["* Ushant, the Duke of Tintagel (Julius, Duke of Trevennick) \u2013 James Frain"]}, {"page": "The Miracle Maker (1999 film)", "response": ["* James Frain as Thomas"]}, {"page": "John Simm", "response": ["In February 2014, Simm began filming the BBC America eight-parter Intruders in Vancouver, British Columbia.
