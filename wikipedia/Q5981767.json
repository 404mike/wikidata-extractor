He began his apprenticeship late due to a broken arm, but in 1986 was released by new manager Ron Saunders without making the grade at the Hawthorns. He joined Wolves on a weekly contract, playing alongside Dean Edwards and Micky Holmes but was released when Graham Turner took over as manager from Brian Little.\nHe began working in an engineering factory, joining non-league Stourbridge before moving to Bedworth United. Whilst at Bedworth he attracted the attention of a number of league sides before Ian Greaves offered him a contract with Mansfield Town in March 1989. Despite the fact that Greaves was sacked within days the new manager George Foster also wanted to sign him and he duly moved to Mansfield for a fee of \u00a38,000, making his league debut as a substitute on 11 March in a 3\u20130 home defeat at the hands of Preston North End. He chose an apt time to score his first league for Mansfield when at the end of the season he scored against local rivals Chesterfield, the goal preserving Mansfield's Third Division status and relegating Chesterfield.\nHe played 44 games for the Stags (23 as a substitute), scoring twice, before joining Rotherham United in March 1991 with Steve Spooner moving in the opposite direction. Towards the end of the following season he contracted pneumonia and after failing to regain his place after his eventual recovery was released, joining Torquay United in July 1993 and quickly establishing himself as a regular member of Don O'Riordan's side.
