James M Hyde, reported at OpenJurist.com  In general, the American press and mining industry favored a decision for Hyde over the British patent holders.  Mining engineer Daniel C. Jackling, who had purchased the Butte & Superior, funded Hyde's lawsuits while contesting the Minerals Separation company patents at the Jackling group of mines in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, which introduced their own modified Hyde flotation process\u2014and were sued by Minerals Separation as well. Thomas Arthur Rickard, editor of the Mining & Scientific Press, San Francisco, made Hyde's suit, and the others that followed against Minerals Separation, into a cause celeb, where the firm was described as evil incarnate.  Hyde received professional accolades, probably the greatest being during the many talks on flotation, recognizing his primacy, presented at the American Institute of Mining Engineer's conference in Arizona, September 1916.
