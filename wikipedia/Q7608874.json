In December 1875, Stephen Cave, MP, and Colonel (later Sir) John Stokes, RE, were sent to Egypt to inquire into Egypt's financial situation. Mr Cave's report, made public only in April 1876, showed that under the existing administration national bankruptcy was inevitable. With no alternatives, European powers used Egypt's indebtedness to extract concessions regarding how the debts would be repaid. Other commissions of inquiry followed, and each one brought Ismail increasingly under European control. The establishment of the Mixed Tribunals in 1876, in place of the system of consular jurisdiction in civil actions, made some of the courts of justice international."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1837\u20131901)", "response": ["*Stephen Cave (1820\u20131880)"]}, {"page": "Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces", "response": ["*7 March 1874: Stephen Cave"]}, {"page": "Isma'il Pasha", "response": ["In December 1875, Stephen Cave and John Stokes were sent out by the British government to inquire into the finances of Egypt, and in April 1876 their report was published, advising that in view of the waste and extravagance it was necessary for foreign Powers to interfere in order to restore credit. The result was the establishment of the Caisse de la Dette. In October, George Goschen and Joubert made a further investigation, which resulted in the establishment of Anglo-French control over finances and the government. A further commission of inquiry by Major Baring (afterwards 1st Earl of Cromer) and others in 1878 culminated in Ismail making over his estates to the nation and accepting the position of a constitutional sovereign, with Nubar as premier, Charles Rivers Wilson as finance minister, and de Bligni\u00e8res as minister of public works."]}, {"page": "Third Derby\u2013Disraeli ministry", "response": ["| Stephen Cave", "| Stephen Cave"]}, {"page": "Second Disraeli ministry", "response": ["| Stephen Cave", "| Stephen Cave"]}]}}
