He was known for his populism and for summing up his arguments in emotive phraseology. His reaction to the arrival of Jewish refugees verged on antisemitism and he hosted Hitler's representative at the House of Commons; however his alleged neglect of his constituency caused difficulties and he was defeated for re-election after a single term.", "link_mentions": {}}}
