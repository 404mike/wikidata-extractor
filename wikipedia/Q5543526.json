He helped Brentford to win the Second Division title in 1934\u201335.\nHe became a coach and manager after the war, taking charge of Dover, Notts County and Manchester City.

He went on to play 18 First Division matches in 1959\u201360. During the early 1960s Oakes proved to be one of the few consistent performers in a struggling City side. He played 22 games in 1960\u201361 and 25 games in 1961\u201362 (scoring his first senior goal), as City were a comfortable mid-table side. However, despite Oakes reaching the 40 game mark, they plummeted to second-from-bottom of the division in 1962\u201363, finishing two points short of 33-point safety benchmark set by 20th place Birmingham City. New manager George Poyser failed to bring promotion in 1963\u201364 and 1964\u201365, though by now Oakes was a consistent first team performer, making 41 league appearances in each campaign."]}]}}
