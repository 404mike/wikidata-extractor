He was a regular in Scarborough's midfield as they won the division, six points clear of favourites Barnet, to become the first team to benefit from the introduction of direct promotion and relegation between Conference and League in place of the longstanding re-election system. In the club's second season in the League, he helped them reach the play-off semi-final, and the following season, he was a goalscorer in what the Daily Mirror dubbed \"one of the most humiliating Cup defeats in [Chelsea's] history\". Scarborough were two goals behind on the night, 3\u20131 down on aggregate, to Chelsea, who were then in second place in the First Division, in the second round of the League Cup. With 24 minutes to go, Graham headed Martin Russell's cross in off the crossbar. Four minutes later, Paul Robinson scrambled the ball home to bring the scores level. Then after a further four minutes, Steve Norris was fouled in the penalty area. While Chelsea claimed the player had been offside, the referee awarded the penalty kick, which Russell converted to complete the victory."]}, {"page": "Ian Bennyworth", "response": ["In the club's second season in the League, Bennyworth helped them reach the play-off semi-final and eliminate Second Division Portsmouth from the League Cup.
