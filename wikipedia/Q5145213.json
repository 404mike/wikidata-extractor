Fisher, Neyman and Pearson proposed approaches that require no prior probabilities on the hypotheses that are being studied.   In contrast, Bayesian inference emphasizes the importance of prior probabilities. But, as far as falsification as a yes/no procedure in Popper's methodology is concerned, any approach that provides a way to accept or not a potential falsifier can be used, including approaches that use Bayes's theorem and estimations of prior probabilities that are made using critical discussions and reasonable assumptions taken from the background knowledge. There is no general rule that considers has falsified an hypothesis with small Bayesian revised probability, because as pointed out by Mayo and argued before by Popper, the individual outcomes described in detail will easily have very small probabilities under available evidence without being genuine anomalies. Nevertheless, Mayo adds, \"they can indirectly falsify hypotheses by adding a methodological falsification rule\". In general, Bayesian statistic can play a role in critical rationalism in the context of inductive logic, which is said to be inductive because implications are generalized to conditional probabilities.  According to Popper and other philosophers such as Colin Howson, Hume's argument precludes inductive logic, but only when the logic makes no use  \"of additional assumptions: in particular, about what is to be assigned positive prior probability\". Inductive logic itself is not precluded, especially not when it is a deductively valid application of Bayes' theorem that is used to evaluate the probabilities of the hypotheses using the observed data and what is assumed about the priors. Gelman and Shalizi mentioned that Bayes' statisticians do not have to disagree with the non-inductivists."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Colin Howson"]}, {"page": "Scientific realism", "response": ["Some philosophers (e.g. Colin Howson) have argued that the no miracles argument commits the base rate fallacy.Colin Howson, Hume's Problem: Induction and the Justification of Belief (2000), Chap. 3 : Realism and the No Miracles Argument"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* Colin Howson, philosopher"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Colin Howson (1945\u20132020)"]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Colin Howson"]}, {"page": "Index of contemporary philosophy articles", "response": ["* Colin Howson"]}, {"page": "Howson", "response": ["* Colin Howson (1945\u20132020), British philosopher"]}, {"page": "Graham Oddie", "response": ["Oddie was educated at the University of Otago, where he received a first class honors degree in philosophy, and at the London School of Economics, where he received a PhD in logic and philosophy of science (1979).
