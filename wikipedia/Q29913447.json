'All the family turned up for the funeral... But of course, my brother didn't bring his family along\u2014 they're much too young.' Here the reference is to the offspring (as distinct from 'all' the family). The neighbors were very good, too. 'The Jones came, and their two children. It was nice, the whole family turning up like that.' Here the usage is more restricted than 'relatives' or 'his relatives,' but includes just both parents and offspring. 'Of course, the children will be leaving home soon. It's always sad to see the family break up like that.' Here the reference is not only to parents and children but to their co-residence, that is, to the household.\"The Family and Industrial Society\", 1983, George Allen Unwin, London, p. 30 Olivia Harris states this confusion is not accidental, but indicative of the familial ideology of capitalist, western countries that pass social legislation that insists members of a nuclear family should live together, and that those not so related should not live together; despite the ideological and legal pressures, a large percentage of families do not conform to the ideal nuclear family type."]}, {"page": "The Playroom (film)", "response": ["* Olivia Harris as Maggie Cantwell - Teen daughter "]}, {"page": "Nils Jacobsen", "response": ["*Ethnicity, Markets, and Migration in the Andes: At the Crossroads of History and Anthropology edited by Brooke Larson, Olivia Harris, and Enrique Tandeter.
