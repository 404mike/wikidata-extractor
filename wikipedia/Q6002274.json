A critic from The New York Times overlooked her forgetting the words of Charles Ives's \"Tom sails away\" and collapsing on Michael Tilson Thomas's piano in a fit of embarrassed giggles, but spoke for several of his colleagues when he expressed his puzzled disappointment at the \"rather peculiar assortment of songs\" that she presented. Such strictures notwithstanding, an unapologetic eclecticism remained the essence of her approach to art song throughout her recital career. Frequently performing in small venues in provincial cities as well as in the grandeur of places like Covent Garden or La Scala, she sang arias and songs by, amongst others, Britten, Canteloube, Debussy, Dowland, Durante, Faur\u00e9, Ginastera, Honegger, Liszt, Mahler, Marcello, Mozart, Pizzetti, Poulenc, Puccini, Purcell, Ravel, Respighi, Rossini, Satie, Alessandro Scarlatti, Sch\u00f6nberg, Schubert, Schumann, Richard Strauss and Vivaldi. She was also a zealous evangelist for American composers, including Dominick Argento, Amy Beach, Bernstein, William Bolcom, Aaron Copland, Richard Danielpour, Carol Hall, Richard Hundley, John Musto, Thomas Pasatieri, Ned Rorem, Michael Tilson Thomas, Virgil Thomson and Jake Heggie.Frederica von Stade Recital, with Martin Isepp, Gala CD, GL 339Frederica von Stade and Martin Katz, Orfeo CD, C 870 121 B, 2012Frederica von Stade: The Complete Columbia Recital Albums, Sony CD, 88875183412, 2016", "* Frederica von Stade: Recital, Edinburgh 1976; songs by Dorumsgaard, Mahler, Ives, Poulenc, Britten, Offenbach and Carol Hall, accompanied by Martin Isepp; recorded live, 31 August 1976; Gala."]}, {"page": "The Turn of the Screw (opera)", "response": ["|Martin Isepp"]}, {"page": "Harriet Cohen International Music Award", "response": ["* Martin Isepp \u2013 Carroll Donner Stuchell Medal for Accompanying"]}, {"page": "La Bonne Chanson (Faur\u00e9)", "response": ["* Hugues Cu\u00e9nod and Martin Isepp (1973), Nimbus Records"]}, {"page": "Handel Society of New York", "response": ["The HSNY was founded in January 1966 by talent manager Arthur Judson and New York businessman and music lover James Grayson.
