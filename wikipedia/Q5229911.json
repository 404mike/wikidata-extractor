Stead was the drummer for the alternate pop / rock band, The Beautiful South.\nAfter his parents separated, Stead moved with his mother and siblings to Cottingham, a village on the outskirts of Hull. He attended Cottingham High school, and following school worked as an electrical fitter for a few years, after which he was employed part-time as a sound engineer at the nearby alternative live music club, The Adelphi.When sixteen-years-old he, with his older brother Mick, started the band The Luddites, with himself on drums and Mark Fell (1962-1984) on bass. The band released two singles, \"Doppelganger\" and \"Altered States\" on Eccentric Records. After The Luddites, Stead joined the band Vicious Circle. In August 1988 he joined The Beautiful South, playing on thirteen albums with the band.\nStead took over the Boars Nest restaurant in Princes Avenue, west Hull, converting it to the 'Union Mash Up' venue and restaurant. Following a July 2012 planning committee failure to add a bar licence for the venue Stead announced that he was closing the business. He promoted a proposed music festival in Huddersfield, 'Song 07', which was cancelled.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 15", "response": ["*  1966   \u2013 Dave Stead, English drummer "]}, {"page": "The Beautiful South", "response": ["The Beautiful South were an English pop rock group formed in 1988 by Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway, two former members of the Hull group The Housemartins, both of whom performed lead and backing vocals.

The band's original material was written by the team of Heaton and Rotheray.", "The third initial bandmember was Dave Rotheray, a songwriting guitarist who'd previously played with Hemingway in two other Hull bands, The Newpolitans and The Velvetones. At the time Rotheray was studying for a PhD at the University of Hull and living on Grafton Street, where Heaton also lived. Rotheray and Heaton became the songwriting team for The Beautiful South, which was conceived as a quintet with Heaton and Hemingway (who was no longer drumming) as the two lead singers. The core band was completed by Dave Stead (ex-Luddites/Vicious Circle) on drums, and former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass guitar. Also important to the band's sound was studio keyboard player Damon Butcher \u2014 though never an official member of the group, he would end up playing virtually all the piano and keyboard parts on the band's albums."]}, {"page": "Welcome to the Beautiful South", "response": ["*Dave Stead \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Stead", "response": ["* Dave Stead (born 1966), British drummer"]}, {"page": "Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs", "response": ["*Dave Stead - drums"]}, {"page": "Choke (album)", "response": ["*Dave Stead - drums"]}, {"page": "Miaow (album)", "response": ["*Dave Stead - drums"]}, {"page": "Carry On up the Charts", "response": ["*Dave Stead \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Blue Is the Colour", "response": ["* Dave Stead \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Quench (album)", "response": ["*Dave Stead - drums"]}, {"page": "Painting It Red", "response": [":*Dave Stead - drums"]}, {"page": "Solid Bronze \u2013 Great Hits", "response": ["*Dave Stead - drums"]}, {"page": "Gaze (album)", "response": ["*Dave Stead - drums"]}, {"page": "Perfect 10 (song)", "response": ["\"Perfect 10\" was seen as a 'tour classic' by The Beautiful South and it has been stated by Dave Stead that, \"There are certain songs you just can't leave out...I think we would be lynched if we didn't play \"Keep It All In\", \"Don't Marry Her\" and \"Perfect 10\".\" This song also features in an episode of sitcom Phoenix Nights, where compere Jerry St Clair sings it in his own style. \"Perfect 10\" was the theme song of UK television series Fat Friends."]}, {"page": "List of ZX Spectrum games", "response": ["|Days of Thunder||Mindscape||Tiertex (David Beresford, Wayne Blake, Dave Stead, Mr. Pixels)||Paramount Pictures||1990"]}, {"page": "Superbi", "response": ["*Dave Stead \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Cottingham High School", "response": ["*Dave Stead - drummer with UK band the Beautiful South"]}]}}
