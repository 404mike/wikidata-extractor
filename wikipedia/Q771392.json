He was probably an English student working at Notre Dame de Paris, most likely in the 1270s or 1280s. Nothing is known about his life, not even his name. His writings survive in two partial copies from Bury St Edmunds; one from the 13th century, and one from the 14th.\nAlong with Johannes de Garlandia and Franco of Cologne, whose work precedes his, Anonymous IV's writings are the main source for understanding the Notre Dame school of polyphony. He wrote about L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin, thereby assigning names to two of the composers of the music of the Notre Dame school who otherwise would have been anonymous. L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin are among the earliest European composers whose names are known. Although they probably died at least fifty years earlier, he described them as still famous and part of the living tradition.\nAnonymous IV mentions L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin as the best composers of organum and discant respectively.  He also mentions specific compositions as being by P\u00e9rotin (or Perotinus), including the four-part organa quadrupla Viderunt and Sederunt. Anonymous IV also mentions the work of the theorist Franco of Cologne, and gives descriptions of organum, discantus, rhythmic modes, rules for use of consonance and dissonance, notation, and genres of composition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Medieval music", "response": ["For specific medieval music theorists, see also: Isidore of Seville, Aurelian of R\u00e9\u00f4me, Odo of Cluny, Guido of Arezzo, Hermannus Contractus, Johannes Cotto (Johannes Afflighemensis), Johannes de Muris, Franco of Cologne, Johannes de Garlandia (Johannes Gallicus), Anonymous IV, Marchetto da Padova (Marchettus of Padua), Jacques of Li\u00e8ge, Johannes de Grocheo, Petrus de Cruce (Pierre de la Croix), and Philippe de Vitry."]}, {"page": "13th century in literature", "response": ["**'Anonymous IV' \u2013 Concerning the Measurement of Polyphonic Song "]}, {"page": "P\u00e9rotin", "response": ["Other than a brief mention by music theorist Johannes de Garlandia in his De Mensurabili Musica, virtually all information on P\u00e9rotin's life comes from Anonymous IV, a pseudonymous English student. Anonymous IV names seven titles from a Magnus Liber\u2014including Viderunt omnes, Sederunt principes and Alleluia Nativitas\u2014that have been identified with surviving works and gives him the title Magister Perotinus (P\u00e9rotinus the Master) meaning he was licensed to teach. It is assumed that Perotinus was French and named P\u00e9rotin, a diminutive of Peter, but attempts to match him with persons in contemporary documents remain speculative.", "P\u00e9rotin, about whom little is known, most likely lived around the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century and is presumed to have been French.  The closest thing to a contemporary account of his life comes from two much later reporters: a brief mention attributed to the music theorist Johannes de Garlandia () in his De Mensurabili Musica, and four mentions in the works of a late 13c English student  known as Anonymous IV, including this paragraph:", "P\u00e9rotin was one of very few composers of his day whose name has been preserved, and can be reliably attached to individual compositions, most of which have been transcribed. Anonymous IV called him Magister Perotinus (P\u00e9rotinus the Master). The title, employed also by Johannes de Garlandia, means that Perotinus, like L\u00e9onin, earned the degree magister artium, almost certainly in Paris, and that he was licensed to teach. However, only Anonymous IV employed the epithet Perotinus Magnus (Perotinus the Great). The name Perotinus, the Latin diminutive of Petrus, is assumed to be derived from the French name P\u00e9rotin, diminutive of Pierre. However \"Petrus\" was one of the most common names in the Ile de France during the High Middle Ages, making further identification difficult. The diminutive was presumably a mark of respect bestowed by his colleagues. The title Magnus was a mark of the esteem in which he was held, even long after his death.", "In addition to his own compositions, as noted by Anonymous IV, P\u00e9rotin set about revising the Magnus Liber Organi. L\u00e9onin's added duplum required skill, and had to be sung fast with up to 40 notes to one of the underlying chant, as a result of which the actual text progressed very slowly. P\u00e9rotin shortened these passages, while adding further voice parts to enrich the harmony. The degree to which he did this has been debated due to the phrase abbreviavit eundem by Anonymous IV. Usually translated as abbreviate, it has been surmised that he shortened the Magnus liber by replacing organum purum with discant clausulae or simply replacing existing clausulae with shorter ones. Some 154 clausulae have been attributed to P\u00e9rotin but many other clausulae are elaborate compositions that would actually expand the compositions in the Liber, and these stylistically resemble his known works which are on a much grander scale than those of his predecessor, and hence do not represent \"abbreviation\". An alternative rendering of abbreviavit is to write down, suggesting that he actually prepared a new edition using his better developed system of rhythmic notation, including mensural notation, as mentioned by Anonymous IV. ", "Two styles emerged from the organum duplum, the \"florid\" and \"discant\" (discantus). The former was more typical of L\u00e9onin, the latter of P\u00e9rotin, though this indirect attribution has been challenged. Anonymous IV described L\u00e9onin as optimus organista (the best composer of organa) but P\u00e9rotin, who revised the former's Magnus Liber Organi (Great Organum Book), as optimus discantor referring to his discant composition., In the original discant organum duplum, the second voice follows the cantus firmus, note on note but at an interval, usually a fourth above. By contrast, in the florid organum, the upper or vox organalis voice wove shorter notes around the longer notes of the lower tenor chant.", "Anonymous IV mentions a number of compositions which he attributes to P\u00e9rotin, including the four-voice Viderunt omnes and Sederunt principes, and the three-voice Alleluia \"Posui adiutorium\" and Alleluia \"Nativitas\". Johannes de Garlandia states that the Magnus Liber commences with Perotin's four-part organa, and makes specific reference to the notation in the three-part Alleluya, Posui adiutorium. Other works are attributed to him by later scholars, such as Heinrich Husmann, on stylistic grounds, all in the organum style, as well as the two-voice Dum sigillum summi Patris and the monophonic Beata viscera in the conductus style. (The conductus sets a rhymed Latin poem called a sequence to a repeated melody, much like a contemporary hymn.) By tradition, the four-part pieces of the Notre Dame school have been attributed to P\u00e9rotin, leaving the two-part pieces to L\u00e9onin. The former include the three-part conductus Salvator hodie. The latter is placed in the Mass for the Circumcision in a 13th century French manuscript. Of these, the best known works are his Viderunt omnes and Sederunt principes. These have been described as representing the peak of musical development of the time.", "Most of P\u00e9rotin's works are in polyphonic form of discant, including the quadrupla and tripla. Here the upper voices move in discant, as rhythmic counterpoint above the sustained tenor notes. This is consistent with Anonymous IV's description of him as optimus discantor. However, like L\u00e9onin, he is likely to have composed in every musical genre and style known to Notre Dame polyphony. ", "P\u00e9rotin's dates of activity have been approximated from some late 12th century edicts (Statuta et donationes piae) of the Bishop of Paris, Odo (Eudes de Sully) (1196\u20131208), in 1198 and 1199. Rebuked by Peter of Capua, the papal legate of the time, the bishop sought to reform the rituals around the Christmas season, forbidding the boistrous costumed performances that existed at the time, in particular, the Feast of Fools. His preference was for elaborate music in its stead, calling for performance in organa triplo vel quadruplo for the Responsory and Benedicamus and other settings. The bishop's edicts are quite specific, and suggest that P\u00e9rotin's organum quadruplum Viderunt omnes was written for Christmas 1198, and his other organum quadruplum Sederunt Principes was composed for Saint Stephen's Day 1199, for the dedication of a new wing of the Notre Dame Cathedral. If written after this, they could not have been written till late 1200 or 1201, since for most of 1200 France lay under an interdict of Pope Innocent III which suppressed the celebration of church services. Hans Tischler dates the revision of the Magnus Liber to around 1180/90. Between the accounts of Anonymous IV, the episcopal edicts and the arrangements in the Magnus liber, the key compositions appear to be corroborated and assigned to this period.", "Anonymous IV identified seven works, that he presumably considered worthy of singling out, and these represent the only direct attribution. Subsequent authors have attributed works on stylistic and chronological grounds. These include Friedrich Ludwig (1910), Heinrich Husmann (1940), Hans Tischler (1950) and Ethel Thurston (1970). Husmann added an additional nine three-part organa, and five clausula to which Ludwig added numerous other clausula. Other authors have attributed all the three-part organa in the Magnus Liber to P\u00e9rotin, which is unlikely. Nevertheless, two of the only three known four-part organa can be attributed to him.", "Key: Anonymous IV (A), Johannes de Garlandia (G), Tischler (Ti), Thurston (Th), Husmann (H). Numbers refer to folios in the F manuscript of the Magnus liber."]}, {"page": "Organum", "response": ["The relevant contemporary authors that write about organum of the Notre-Dame school, Anonymous IV, Johannes de Garlandia, the St. Emmeram Anonymous and Franco of Cologne, to name a few, are not always as clear as could be desired. Nevertheless, a lot of information can be distilled from the comparative research of their writings. Organum purum is one of three styles of organum, which is used in section where the chant is syllabic thus where the tenor can not be modal. As soon as the chant uses ligatures, the tenor becomes modal and it will have become discant, which is the second form. The third form is copula (Lat. coming together) which in the words of Johannes de Garlandia \"is between organum and discant\". and according to Waite a bridge section between modal and non-modal sections. It seems that for most instances we can take Garlandia literally where he says 'between' organum and discant. In organa dupla, the copula is very similar to a short, cadential organum purum section but in organa tripla or conducti it is seen that irregular notation is used. Either the last notes of ligatures are affixed with a plica which divides the notes in smaller values, or a series of disjunct rests is used in jolting succession in both parts, creating what is also called hocket. These features also can be frequently found in two-part discantus on special cadences or a preparation of a cadence, where they are also referred to as \"copulae\". Garlandia states simply: \"a copula is where are any number of lines are found\". referring to the plicae or rest-signs. Thus organum duplum on a texted chant as a Gradual, Responsory or the Verse of an Alleluia can be schematized as follows:", "P\u00e9rotin \"is the best composer of Discantus\", according to Anonymous IV, an English student, writing ca.1275, who has provided at least a few morsels of factual information on Paris Organum and its composers. P\u00e9rotin further developed discantus in three part Organum (Organum Triplum) where both organal voices are in discantus. Note that organum purum is not possible in three-part organa, all three parts are modal and need to be organized according to the rhythmic modes. P\u00e9rotin even went as far as composing two four-part organa (quadrupla), \"Viderunt omnes\" and \"Sederunt principes\" which were performed in Notre Dame in 1198 on New Year's Day and in 1199 on the feast of St. Stephen (a decree of Odon de Sully, Bishop of Paris, exists which stipulates the performance of 'organa tripla vel quadrupla') Apart from organa, P\u00e9rotin extended the form of the Aquitanian Versus which was henceforth called conductus. Any conductus is a new composition on new texts and is always composed in the rhythmic modes. Perotin set several texts by Philippe le Chancelier, while some texts refer to contemporary events. Two-part conductus form the larger part, though conductus exist for one to four voices. Three and four part conductus are, by necessity, composed throughout in discantus style. As in organa tripla, handling three voices (or four) precludes the kind of rhythmic freedom found in dupla. In conductus the distinction is made between 'cum littera' and 'sine litera', texted sections and melismatic sections. The texted parts can sometimes go beyond the modal measure and then fall back into regular mode in the melismatic section. Again according to Anonymous IV, P\u00e9rotin wrote a number of replacement clausulae from organa dupla by L\u00e9onin. As the tenor in organa dupla in discant sections proceeds always in the 5th mode (all longs in a rhythmic group ordine), P\u00e9rotin, who was a generation removed from L\u00e9onin, saw fit to improve them by introducing different modes for the tenor and new melodic lines for the dupla, increasing the rhythmic organization and diversity of the section. However, in the largest compilation of Notre-Dame repertoires (F) no less than 462 clausulae exist, many recurrences of the same clausulae (Domino, et gaudebit in variant settings, according to. 'written in a variety of styles and with varying competence' A further innovation was the motellus, to be found in W2, in which the upper part of a discant section is supplied with a new text, so that when the tenor utters a single syllable of chant, the upper part will pronounce several syllables or words. As such it reminds of the prosulae that were composed, replacing a long melisma in a chant with new, additional words. This would have been the first instance of two different texts being sung in harmony. In turn, the motellus gave birth to the motet which is a poly-textual piece in discant, which obviously sparked a lot a creativity as it soon became a prolific form of composition."]}, {"page": "L\u00e9onin", "response": ["All that is known about him comes from the writings of a later student at the cathedral known as Anonymous IV, an Englishman who left a treatise on theory and who mentions L\u00e9onin as the composer of the Magnus Liber, the \"great book\" of organum.  Much of the Magnus Liber is devoted to clausulae\u2014melismatic portions of Gregorian chant which were extracted into separate pieces where the original note values of the chant were greatly slowed down and  a fast-moving upper part is superimposed.  L\u00e9onin might have been the first composer to use the rhythmic modes, and may have invented a notation for them. According to W.G. Waite, writing in 1954:  \"It was L\u00e9onin's incomparable achievement to introduce a rational system of rhythm into polyphonic music for the first time, and, equally important, to create a method of notation expressive of this rhythm.\"W.G. Waite: The Rhythm of Twelfth-Century Polyphony: its Theory and Practice, .  Yale Studies in the History of Music, New Haven, 1954.", "The Magnus Liber was intended for liturgical use.  According to Anonymous IV, \"Magister Leoninus (L\u00e9onin) was the finest composer of organum; he wrote the great book (Magnus Liber) for the gradual and antiphoner for the sacred service.\"  All of the Magnus Liber is for two voices, although little is known about actual performance practice: the two voices were not necessarily soloists.", "According to Anonymous IV, L\u00e9onin's work was improved and expanded by the later composer P\u00e9rotin.

In addition to naming the two composers as \"the best composers of organum,\" and specifying that they compiled the big book of organum known as the Magnus Liber Organi, he provides a few tantalizing bits of information on the music and the principles involved in its composition. P\u00e9rotin is the first composer of organum quadruplum\u2014four-voice polyphony\u2014at least the first composer whose music has survived, since complete survivals of notated music from this time are scarce.", "While music with notation has survived, in substantial quantity, the interpretation of this music, especially with regard to rhythm, remains controversial. Three music theorists describe the contemporary practice: Johannes de Garlandia, Franco of Cologne, and Anonymous IV. However, they were all writing more than two generations after the music was written, and may have been imposing their current practice, which was quickly evolving, on music which was conceived differently. In much music of the Notre-Dame School the lowest voices sing long note values while the upper voice or voices sing highly ornamented lines, which often use repeating patterns of long and short notes known as the \"rhythmic modes\". This marked the beginning of notation capable of showing relative durations of notes within and between parts."]}, {"page": "Clausula (music)", "response": ["Clausulae emerged from the compositional practices of the Notre Dame school in Paris c. 1160\u20131250 (during the stylistic period known as Ars antiqua). The composers L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin in particular contributed heavily in composing clausulae. Rather than write entirely new music, the preference was to take existing music, that is, plainchant melodies, and develop or improve upon them. According to an English author known as Anonymous IV (ca. 1280), \"P\u00e9rotin was better at making clausulae than L\u00e9onin had been in that P\u00e9rotin was better at making better discant style of clausulae.\" The appearance of clausula provided the first rhythmic system. (It is hard to find rhythmic notation in the earliest motets because of the lack of the use of clear rhythmic notation in the manuscripts.)P\u00e9rotin's clausulae make use of the rhythmic modes, whose strict metrical feet necessitated that voices change notes together (discantus). This was in contrast to the earlier practice of one voice moving in a free rhythm above a \"tenor\" voice (Latin tenere: \"to hold\") sustaining the long notes of a cantus firmus. The tenor line was often repeated to allow for expansion of the clausula; this was the origin of the technique known as isorhythm."]}, {"page": "Conductus", "response": ["Anonymous IV (ca. 1275) gives a few comments on polyphonic conducti in his treatise.
