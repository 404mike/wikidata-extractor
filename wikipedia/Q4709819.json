The goalscorers were Alf Common for Sheffield United and, in controversial circumstances, Harry Wood for Southampton. A replay was held a week later on 26 April, also at the Crystal Palace stadium, but before a much-reduced crowd of 33,068. Sheffield United won 2\u20131 with goals by George Hedley and Billy Barnes against one by Albert Brown for Southampton. Sheffield United won the cup again in 1915 and 1925. Southampton, whose appearance in the 1902 final was the last by a team from outside The Football League, won the cup in 1976.", "The second replay was played on a neutral venue at Elm Park, the home of Reading FC, on Monday, 3 February, in front of a crowd of only 6,000. The pitch was icy and covered in snow, so much so that the touchlines had to be painted blue, and the match kicked off with snow still falling. As in their first two meetings, the teams were very evenly matched and the tie was eventually decided by a mistake. The score at half-time was 0\u20130 but then Tottenham took the lead with a goal by Jack Kirwan. Southampton equalised very quickly with a goal by Archie Turner and then, when it looked as if the match would end in another draw, Tottenham's Sandy Tait made a poor backpass to his goalkeeper Fred Griffiths. It was intercepted by Albert Brown who rounded Griffiths to score the winning goal.", "Southampton then faced First Division Bury at Gigg Lane in the third round on Saturday, 22 February. Bury had outplayed Southampton in the 1900 FA Cup Final, winning 4\u20130, so Southampton wanted to redress the balance somewhat. In a match that Collett, Chalk and Holley have described as a \"real thriller\", Southampton took a measure of revenge by winning 3\u20132. As described in Chalk and Holley's account, the match was all square at 2\u20132 with goals by Harry Wood and Joe Turner matching those by George Ross and Charlie Sagar for the home side. Injuries to the two Southampton goalscorers had reduced them to nine players and the team were defending \"desperately\" to hang on for a replay. After a spell of seven successive corners for Bury, Albert Brown broke up the pitch with most of the Bury players in the Southampton half. After sprinting the full length of the pitch, Brown unleashed a shot that hit the crossbar and rebounded over his head. Edgar Chadwick was following up and trapped the ball, feinted to go past the goalkeeper and, as the match report says, \"coolly slotted the ball in the other corner\" to secure victory.", "In the semi-final on Saturday, 15 March, Southampton returned to White Hart Lane, this time a neutral venue, to play First Division Nottingham Forest and won 3\u20131 after extra time. The score was 1\u20131 at the end of normal time after goals by Chadwick for Southampton and John Calvey for Forest. In extra time, Albert Brown scored twice, once from the penalty spot and then, in the final minute, with what the match report called \"a wonderful goal with a screw shot from an oblique angle\".", "Southampton hoped to do better in the second half with the wind behind them but, as before, they wasted chances and were unable to overcome the Sheffield half-backs. Eventually, however, Albert Brown equalised after 70 minutes with a shot from a pass by Chadwick. The Times says that Southampton then had the upper hand for several minutes and \"should have scored\" again. Foulke had to make saves from Chadwick, Wood and Lee. It looked as though the match was going into extra time, when, with ten minutes remaining, Robinson failed to cut out a cross from Common and Barnes was left with an unguarded net to score the winner for Sheffield. Southampton had a chance to equalise in the final minute, but Fry kicked the ball high over the crossbar.", "|CF || Albert Brown", "|CF || Albert Brown"]}, {"page": "List of Southampton F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Albert Brown"]}, {"page": "Albert Frederick Brown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Brown (footballer, born 1879)"]}, {"page": "Albert Brown (footballer born 1879)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Brown (footballer, born 1879)"]}]}}
