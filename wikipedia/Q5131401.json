His style of criticism, acerbic, flowery and (perhaps most importantly) carried out on the first night of productions, set the standard for theatre reviewers through to today.\nScott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with William Archer, Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw and others. After he gave a particularly ill-considered 1898 interview, in which he attacked the morals of theatre people, especially actresses, he was forced to retire as a theatre critic and his reputation and prospects suffered badly until, by the end of his life, he was impoverished.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["* Review of the opening night by Clement Scott"]}, {"page": "Iolanthe", "response": ["* Transcription of a review of Iolanthe by Clement Scott"]}, {"page": "Ruddigore", "response": ["|style=\"text-align: left;\" |Review from The Illustrated London News.\"The Playhouses\", The Illustrated London News, 29 January 1887 (signed C.S., possibly Clement Scott)"]}, {"page": "H.M.S.
