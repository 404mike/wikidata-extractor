They named the new element brevium (from Latin brevis meaning brief); the name was changed to protoactinium (from Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 + \u1f00\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 meaning \"first beam element\") in 1918 when two groups of scientists, led by the Austrian Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered the much longer-lived 231Pa. The name was shortened to protactinium in 1949. This element was little characterized until 1960, when A. G. Maddock and his co-workers in the U.K. isolated 130\u00a0grams of protactinium from 60 tonnes of waste left after extraction of uranium from its ore.Greenwood, p. 1251"]}, {"page": "Atomic theory", "response": ["While experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one element at each position on the periodic table.

In 1913, after the products of more radioactive decays were known, Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans independently proposed their radioactive displacement law, which states that beta (i.e., )\u00a0emission from one element produces another element one place to the right in the periodic table, while alpha emission produces an element two places to the left."]}, {"page": "Ernest Rutherford", "response": ["From 1900 to 1903, he was joined at McGill by the young chemist Frederick Soddy (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the thorium emanations. Once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, Soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named thoron (later found to be an isotope of radon). They also found another type of thorium they called Thorium X, and kept on finding traces of helium. They also worked with samples of \"Uranium X\" from William Crookes and radium from Marie Curie."]}, {"page": "Glenn T. Seaborg", "response": ["Seaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131, which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes."]}, {"page": "History of physics", "response": ["In the 19th century, experimenters began to detect unexpected forms of radiation: Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen caused a sensation with his discovery of X-rays in 1895; in 1896 Henri Becquerel discovered that certain kinds of matter emit radiation on their own accord. In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered the electron, and new radioactive elements found by Marie and Pierre Curie raised questions about the supposedly indestructible atom and the nature of matter. Marie and Pierre coined the term \"radioactivity\" to describe this property of matter, and isolated the radioactive elements radium and polonium. Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy identified two of Becquerel's forms of radiation with electrons and the element helium. Rutherford identified and named two types of radioactivity and in 1911 interpreted experimental evidence as showing that the atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Classical theory, however, predicted that this structure should be unstable. Classical theory had also failed to explain successfully two other experimental results that appeared in the late 19th century. One of these was the demonstration by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley\u2014known as the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment\u2014which showed there did not seem to be a preferred frame of reference, at rest with respect to the hypothetical luminiferous ether, for describing electromagnetic phenomena. Studies of radiation and radioactive decay continued to be a preeminent focus for physical and chemical research through the 1930s, when the discovery of nuclear fission by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch opened the way to the practical exploitation of what came to be called \"atomic\" energy."]}, {"page": "Lise Meitner", "response": ["Attending Planck's lectures did not take up all her time, and Meitner approached Heinrich Rubens, the head of the experimental physics institute, about doing some research. Rubens said that he would be happy for her to work in his laboratory. He also added that Otto Hahn at the chemistry institute was looking for a physicist to collaborate with. A few minutes later she was introduced to Hahn. He had studied radioactive substances under Sir William Ramsay, and in Montreal under Rutherford, and was already credited with the discovery of what were then thought to be several new radioactive elements. (In fact, they were isotopes of known elements, but the concept of an isotope, along with the term, was only propounded by Frederick Soddy in 1913.) Hahn was the same age as herself, and she noted his informal and approachable manner. In Canada there had been no requirement to be circumspect when addressing the egalitarian New Zealander Rutherford, but many people in Germany found his manner offputting, and characterised him as an \"Anglicised Berliner\". In Montreal, Hahn had become accustomed to collaboration with physicists including at least one woman, Harriet Brooks."]}, {"page": "Protactinium", "response": ["The element was first identified in 1913 by Kazimierz Fajans and Oswald Helmuth G\u00f6hring and named brevium because of the short half-life of the specific isotope studied, i.e. protactinium-234. A more stable isotope of protactinium, 231Pa, was discovered in 1917/18 by Lise Meitner in collaboration with Otto Hahn, and they chose the name protactinium.Meitner, L. (1918) Die Muttersubstanz des Actiniums, ein Neues Radioaktives Element von Langer Lebensdauer. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektrochemie und angewandte physikalische Chemie 24: 169-173. The IUPAC chose the name \"protactinium\" in 1949 and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as discoverers. The new name meant \"(nuclear) precursor of actinium\" and reflected that actinium is a product of radioactive decay of protactinium. John Arnold Cranston (working with Frederick Soddy and Ada Hitchins) is also credited with discovering the most stable isotope in 1915, but delayed his announcement due to being called up for service in the First World War.John Arnold Cranston.

(1918) The parent of actinium. Proceedings of the Royal Society A \u2013 Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences 94: 384-403. Thus the name brevium was changed to protactinium as the new element was part of the decay chain of uranium-235 as the parent of actinium (from  pr\u00f4tos \"first, before\"). The IUPAC confirmed this naming in 1949.Greenwood, p. 1251 The discovery of protactinium completed one of the last gaps in the early versions of the periodic table, proposed by Mendeleev in 1869, and it brought to fame the involved scientists.Shea, William R.
