Don Wauchope played an important role within the early growth of Scottish rugby and after retiring from international rugby he became a referee and was the President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He was considered Scotland's outstanding half-back of the early 1880s and is credited as being one of the pioneers of modern half-back play.Born into the Don-Wauchope Baronetcy, Don-Wauchope was an all-round sportsman, representing his school and then university in rugby and athletics. He was a prolific try scorer, scoring six tries in his international career, though as a try was not worth any points at the time his scoring record remains blank. Don-Wauchope was also a keen cricketer, he went on to represent Scotland, playing in the very first encounter between Scotland and Ireland in 1888.", "link_mentions": {}}}
