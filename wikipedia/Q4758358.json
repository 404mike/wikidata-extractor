Don Wauchope played an important role within the early growth of Scottish rugby and after retiring from international rugby he became a referee and was the President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He was considered Scotland's outstanding half-back of the early 1880s and is credited as being one of the pioneers of modern half-back play.Born into the Don-Wauchope Baronetcy, Don-Wauchope was an all-round sportsman, representing his school and then university in rugby and athletics. He was a prolific try scorer, scoring six tries in his international career, though as a try was not worth any points at the time his scoring record remains blank. Don-Wauchope was also a keen cricketer, he went on to represent Scotland, playing in the very first encounter between Scotland and Ireland in 1888.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wauchope", "response": ["*Andrew Ramsay Don-Wauchope, Scottish rugby player"]}, {"page": "1884 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Scotland: JP Veitch (Royal HSFP), Bill Maclagan (London Scottish) capt., DJ Macfarlan (London Scottish), George Campbell Lindsay (Fettesian-Lorettonians), Andrew Ramsay Don-Wauchope (Fettesian-Lorettonians), AGG Asher (Oxford University), T Ainslie (Edinburgh Inst FP), JB Brown (Glasgow Acads), John Jamieson (West of Scotland), R Maitland (Edinburgh Inst FP), William Peterkin (Edinburgh University), C Reid (Edinburgh Acads), D.

Their request was granted, and the partnership between the two schools was so successful it was turned into a friendly sporting club. The original circular for the official formation of the club was signed by A. R. Paterson, a well known Lorretonian and Oxonian and Andrew Ramsay Don-Wauchope, representing Fettes and Cambridge.

Don-Wauchope was followed soon after by his younger brother Patrick, who won six caps for Scotland while representing the club.
