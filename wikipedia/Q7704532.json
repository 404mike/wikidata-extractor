The ancient heritage of the sport in the United Kingdom and Ireland lies in a number of traditional events, the most famous of which is arguably the traditional Highland Games, which itself is a source of many events now practised in modern strongman competitions, such as World's Strongest Man and International Federation of Strength Athletes (IFSA) sponsored events. However, the traditional events still are popularly contested events today. In the more modern phenomenon that is the World's Strongest Man and its associated competitions, the United Kingdom and Ireland remain well represented with Eddie Hall, Terry Hollands, and former competitor Glenn Ross and John Ryan Cappalahan respectively with regular appearances at world finals, and with three men having won the title of World's Strongest Man, as well as Shane Davis Cappalahan appearing in eight final events.", "In the late 1970s, televised strongman competitions began with Britain's Strongest Man (BSM) first being shown in 1979 by the BBC. A new generation emerged, with the events attracting individuals from many disciplines such as field athletics, weightlifting and powerlifting. These competitions fed other international competitions such as Europe's Strongest Man and World's Strongest Man. Household names, such as Geoff Capes, Jamie Reeves and Gary Taylor dominated, with these three in particular going on to win World's Strongest Man titles. The modern era has seen this trend continue with Terry Hollands, Mark Felix and Laurence Shahlaei being regular faces at World's Strongest Man and its associated Super Series. Featured events in these contests have been tailored to emphasize a more well-rounded athlete, to reflect that viewpoint on strongman as a whole, and in the interests of increased popularity and marketability among the masses. Almost inevitably, more than one interested party has seen the benefits of strength competitions. Alternative organizations have formed in recent years, comprising a new wave of influence in the field, with the United Kingdom Strength Council (UKSC) founded by Britain's Strongest Man multi-year champion Glenn Ross setting up events separate from BSM, as has the IFSA. Ross and his UK Strongest Man competitions hold a philosophical difference in approach with the World's Strongest Man related venues, including more brute strength events similar to traditional strongman and powerlifting, with less emphasis on field athleticism and endurance.", "| Adam BishopMark FelixGraham HicksTerry HollandsLaurence ShahlaeiPaul SmithLuke Stoltman", "| Mark FelixEddie HallTerry HollandsLaurence ShahlaeiLuke StoltmanTom Stoltman", "| Adam BishopMark FelixCharlie GoughEddie HallTerry HollandsLaurence ShahlaeiLuke Stoltman", "| Eddie HallGraham HicksBen KelseyTerry HollandsLaurence Shahlaei", "| Mark FelixEddie HallGraham HicksTerry HollandsLloyd RenalsLaurence Shahlaei", "| Chris GearingEddie HallGraham HicksTerry HollandsJack McIntoshLaurence Shahlaei(injured - withdrew)", "| Mark FelixRob FramptonTerry HollandsJack McIntoshLaurence Shahlaei", "| Mark FelixTerry HollandsDarren SadlerLaurence ShahlaeiMark WestabyReserve: Rob Frampton", "| Laurence ShahlaeiTerry HollandsMark FelixJimmy MarkuDarren Sadler", "| Laurence ShahlaeiTerry HollandsMark FelixJimmy MarkuOli Thompson", "|  Terry Hollands", "| Darren SadlerTerry HollandsMark FelixJimmy MarkuMark Westaby", "| Darren SadlerTerry HollandsMark Felix", "|  Terry Hollands", "| Brian IrwinTerry HollandsMick GoslingCarl Waitoa (rep.
