Born in Newport in Monmouthshire, Llewellyn became the Welsh heavyweight champion in 1922. A police officer by profession, he often fought under the name PC Trevor Llewellyn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Norris", "response": ["Norris's first recorded professional bout was against Wally Buckley at Liverpool Stadium on 2 September 1920. Norris lost the contest in the third round through a disqualification. There are no recorded fights for Norris until February 1922 when he faced fellow Welshman Gipsy Daniels at the Drill Hall in Cardiff. Daniels, a future British heavyweight champion, stopped Norris with a knockout in the third round. Norris fought at least twice more in 1922 and both recorded bouts ended in losses. His first was by points decision against Seaman Powell at Pill Athletic Ground in Newport, then a failed challenge for the Welsh heavyweight title versus Trevor Llewellyn. Although the contest against Llewellyn was scheduled for twenty three-minute rounds, Norris again only lasted to the third round, this time losing by a technical knockout. On 3 May, he was back at the Drill Hall, this time facing and beating Billy Prestage, knocking him out with a right hook. Norris met Llewellyn again on 30 August 1924, though this time not for the title. On this occasion Norris won, when he was given the decision after the match went the full distance. He followed this up with a win three weeks later in Liverpool, knocking out local fighter Ike Ingleton. In November 1924 he met Seaman Powell again, at the Pavilion Theatre in Newport; this time the result was a draw."]}, {"page": "Dick Power", "response": ["Although there is little record of Power's amateur career, he is recorded on the 4 July 1925 as fighting professionally against Trevor Llewellyn at Lydney near the Wales/England border. Power took the fight on a points decision, and followed this with two wins in August, both in his home-town, over Eddie Wolf and Bill Bates. On 12 September, he faced Belgian Pierre Charles at The Ring in Blackfriars. Charles was the more experienced fighter, and would soon become Belgian and European heavyweight champion, but Power took the fight after Charles was forced to retire in the first round. He followed up this win by facing Con O'Kelly in an October fight in Manchester, losing by knockout in the third. 1925 ended with a challenge for the Welsh heavyweight title, arranged at the Palace Theatre in Crumlin on Boxing Day. His challenger was Tom Norris of Clydach Vale and the match was scheduled for fifteen three minutes rounds. The match only reached the eleventh round when Power was stopped via a technical knockout."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Trevor Llewellyn"]}]}}
