He obtained his BA and his PhD in physics from Oxford University.\nIn 1983 he became a Staff Senior Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he served as head of the theoretical physics group from 1992 to 1999.\nTrained in theoretical physics, his primary activity is with the ATLAS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, which he joined in 1996; he served as ATLAS physics coordinator in 2006\u20132007 and currently heads Berkeley Lab's ATLAS group. His research emphasizes the importance of experiment in testing theoretical ideas, and in driving theoretical developments aimed at understanding interactions among fundamental particles. Much of his research looks to show how the Standard Model can be tested at hadron colliders.\nIn 2011, Hinchliffe, Chris Quigg, Estia Eichten, and Kenneth Lane won the J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics \"for their work, separately and collectively, to chart a course of the exploration of TeV scale physics using multi-TeV hadron colliders\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sakurai Prize", "response": ["* 2011 Chris Quigg, Estia Eichten, Ian Hinchliffe, and Kenneth Lane:  \"For their work, separately and collectively, to chart a course of the exploration of TeV scale physics using multi-TeV hadron colliders.\""]}, {"page": "Brian Routh", "response": ["Routh has collaborated with and appeared with: The Kipper Kids; the Blue Man Group; Nina Sobell; Karen Finley (a 1981 tour of Italy and Germany); Henry Rollins (in Arizona, 1987); Public Image Ltd; Genesis P-Orridge; Sex Pistols (at Reading University, 1975); Johanna Went (at the Theatre Carnival); Sequel Cafe LA USA; Eric Bogosian; Anne Bean; Bow Gamelan Ensemble; Lol Coxhill; Evan Parker; Derek Bailey; Ian Hinchliffe."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Lane (physicist)", "response": ["In 1984 he coauthored \"Supercollider Physics\" (with Eichten, Ian Hinchliffe and Chris Quigg), which has strongly influenced the quest for future discoveries at hadron colliders such as the Fermilab Tevatron the SSC, and the LHC at CERN.
