Some of the major teams in Ireland include Shamrock Rovers, Dundalk FC and Shelbourne FC in the Republic, Glentoran and Linfield in Northern Ireland, and Derry City, a team from the North who play in the League of Ireland. Due to the financial incentives abroad, most of Ireland's top players, such as Damien Duff, John O'Shea, Aiden McGeady and Jonny Evans, play in the leagues of larger European countries, particularly in England and Scotland. This, along with the Irish media's huge coverage of the English league, is one of the reasons why Irish people tend to support leading British clubs such as Manchester United, Liverpool and Celtic. Only occasionally does a League of Ireland or Irish League player make either of the national teams, despite the fact that the leagues sometimes produce some of Ireland's top players including internationals Kevin Doyle, Shane Long and Gareth McAuley and players like Roy Keane in the past."]}, {"page": "Coleraine F.C.", "response": ["After a poor start to the 1999\u201300 season, Shiels resigned and was replaced by Marty Quinn, who rallied the team to finish second in the league behind Linfield and reach the Irish Cup semi-finals and the Coca-Cola Cup final. The next 2 seasons saw Coleraine finish fourth both times \u2013 potential title challenges being ruined by inconsistency. In 2002\u201303, Coleraine ended the season in third place and reached their first Irish Cup Final since 1986. In the final, they faced Glentoran as massive underdogs as the east Belfast side were looking to complete a clean sweep of trophies. After an early strike from Gareth McAuley was harshly ruled out, Coleraine kept going and scored through Jody Tolan. Despite increasing Glentoran pressure, Coleraine held on and the trophy famine was over. The following season saw the club reach the Irish Cup final again, but this time it was Glentoran who emerged triumphant."]}, {"page": "Ballyclare Comrades F.C.", "response": ["One of the club's most famous products was Northern Ireland and Sunderland defender Paddy McNair who attends games when possible.

The team initially struggled to score goals, eventually recording their first league goal the fourth game of the new season when Gareth McAuley scored an injury time header in a 1\u20131 result against Fulham. 28 September 2013 saw them secure an historic 2\u20131 victory against league champions, Manchester United, their first win at Old Trafford in 35 years. Under his managership, however, they won only one further game, a 2\u20130 home defeat of Crystal Palace on 2 November 2013. On 9 November, West Brom were minutes away from securing a historic win at Stamford Bridge that would have ended Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's undefeated home record, but a controversial penalty decision ensured that the game ended 2\u20132. A further draw and four straight defeats followed and on 14 December 2013 Clarke was placed on gardening leave until May 2014, after a 1\u20130 loss at Cardiff City. This defeat had left the club two points above the relegation zone in 16th place. They had won 9 of the previous 41 Premier League matches."]}, {"page": "Keith Alexander (footballer)", "response": ["In the close season Alexander purchased Gareth McAuley and Ciaran Toner. Toner and Marcus Richardson were later involved in a training ground fracas, and were both allowed to leave on loan with a view to a transfer. Regardless, rumours persisted that the morale of the squad was low both because of this incident, and in relation to the payment of bonuses. Lincoln again finished in the play-off places and played Southend United in the final, again at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Neither side could manage a goal in normal time, and all three strikers had to be replaced in the second half. Derek Asamoah, who was in poor form, was brought on alongside defenders Matt Bloomer and Lee Beevers. However, Southend scored twice in extra time to win."]}, {"page": "Roy Hodgson", "response": ["Despite having to deal with West Brom's notoriously frugal approach to the transfer market, Hodgson made several signings in the summer of 2011, replacing goalkeeping duo Boaz Myhill and Scott Carson with former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster on loan from Birmingham City and drafting in M\u00e1rton F\u00fcl\u00f6p from Ipswich Town on a free transfer. Experience and height was added to the backline in the form of Northern Ireland international Gareth McAuley on a free transfer and recently relegated Preston North End's player of the season Billy Jones also arrived to add cover at fullback. Prior to the start of the season, former Hawthorns hero Zolt\u00e1n Gera also returned on a free transfer from Fulham and a summer-long chase for Shane Long was finally ended with the Irish international signing for an undisclosed fee reported to be in the region of \u00a34million. Long joined the club in time to make a scoring d\u00e9but in the season's opener."]}, {"page": "Chris Brunt", "response": ["He missed out on the chance to appear at Euro 2016 after damaging his anterior cruciate ligament which required surgery.

After sustaining a head injury early on, he recovered to set up a goal for club teammate Gareth McAuley and scored the final goal of a 4\u20130 win."]}]}}
