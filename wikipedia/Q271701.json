However, she held off these competitors and went on to win her third Olympic title at the 1936 Winter Olympics, albeit in very controversial circumstances with Cecilia Colledge finishing a very close second. Indeed, after the school figures section at the 1936 Olympic competition, Colledge and Henie were virtually neck and neck with Colledge trailing by just a few points. As Sandra Stevenson recounted in The Independent, \"the closeness [of the competition] infuriated Henie, who, when the result for that section was posted on a wall in the competitors' lounge, swiped the piece of paper and tore it into little pieces. The draw for the free skating [then] came under suspicion after Henie landed the plum position of skating last, while Colledge had to perform second of the 26 competitors. The early start was seen as a disadvantage, with the audience not yet whipped into a clapping frenzy and the judges known to become freer with their higher marks as the event proceeded. Years later, a fairer, staggered draw was adopted to counteract this situation\".", "Controversy appeared first when Henie greeted Hitler with a Nazi salute at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby Berchtesgaden, where Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription. She was strongly denounced in the Norwegian press for this. In her revised 1954 biography, she states that no Norwegian judge was in the panel for the 1936 Olympics\u2014as she was entitled to as a Norwegian. She therefore made the most of it and won her third Olympic medal. When she\u2014as a gold medal winner\u2014passed Hitler's tribune with silver medalist Cecilia Colledge and bronze medalist Vivi-Anne Hult\u00e9n, neither she nor the others honored Hitler with the Nazi salute. The 1936 European Figure Skating Championships also took place in Berlin and neither Henie, Colledge, nor Megan Taylor paid obeisance to Hitler."]}, {"page": "1938 in sports", "response": ["** Ladies' champion: Megan Taylor, Great Britain"]}, {"page": "World Figure Skating Championships", "response": ["| 1934 ||  Oslo ||  Sonja Henie ||  Megan Taylor ||  Liselotte Landbeck", "| 1936 ||  Paris ||  Sonja Henie ||  Megan Taylor ||  Vivi-Anne Hult\u00e9n", "| 1937 ||  London ||  Cecilia Colledge ||  Megan Taylor ||  Vivi-Anne Hult\u00e9n", "| 1938 ||  Stockholm ||  Megan Taylor ||  Cecilia Colledge ||  Hedy Stenuf", "| 1939 ||  Prague ||  Megan Taylor ||  Hedy Stenuf ||  Daphne Walker"]}, {"page": "1939 in sports", "response": ["** Ladies' champion \u2013 Megan Taylor, Great Britain"]}, {"page": "1937 in sports", "response": ["** Ladies\u2019 champion: Megan Taylor, Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Ice Capades", "response": ["In 1942, the show featured world champion skater Megan Taylor, new talent Donna Atwood, and an acrobatic team from Boston called the Hub Trio featuring Leonard Mullen, Kenneth Mullen and Eddie Raiche.
