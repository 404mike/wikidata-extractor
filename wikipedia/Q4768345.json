Although a new version of the original theme tune was used and the overall look of the set generally in keeping with the earlier version, characters were given varying makeovers, with none of the original models being used, and several new minor characters introduced. CGI and Chroma key effects featured heavily. The proposed new series was not picked up, reportedly due to it being considered too costly."]}, {"page": "Current TV", "response": ["*Anne Foy"]}, {"page": "SMart", "response": ["|| Anne Foy "]}, {"page": "21st World Scout Jamboree", "response": ["The entire UK contingent arrived one day before the rest of the world, and had a party on the Tropical Hub stage with performances from Liberty X and Lemar, along with Radio 1 DJ Jason King and CBBC TV presenter Anne Foy.

Another surreal, ongoing sketch involved actors in knights' costumes and other strange outfits, fighting and doing bizarre things in a busy street, to the confusion of shoppers.  Calum Callaghan played a boy who invited people to play card games with him in a train station and always accused them of cheating.  Marvin Benoit played street magician 'David Plain' - a spoof of the famous magician David Blaine.  Simon Kane played Remote Controlled Kid in all three series.
