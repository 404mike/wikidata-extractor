In June, the club sold outside-left Billy Murphy to fellow Second Division club Oldham Athletic, with fellow winger Reg Watson moving the other way as part of the deal. Also in June, the Saints signed inside-forward Bill Fraser from Aldershot Town in an \"unusually complicated deal\" including an initial payment of \u00a360, another \u00a3200 from a friendly match between the two sides, \u00a350 if he made 20 appearances for the first team during the season (which he did not), and a 5% share of any future transfer fee.

In August, Southampton brought in two more players \u2013 inside-right Oswald Littler joined from Rochdale (after a Football Association suspension for the player was lifted upon appeal by the club), and full-back Arthur Roberts signed from Ardsley Athletic.", "Transfer activity continued during the course of the season. In September 1929, the Saints Supporters Club raised \u00a3400 to sign Scottish inside-left Peter Dougall (as well as teammate Hood) from Clyde, with an additional \u00a350 to be paid should either player make six appearances for the club. In October, recent amateur signing Ernie Warren left the club to sign another amateur deal with Southwick, although by March 1930 he had returned to sign for the Saints as a professional. The most significant transfer of the season came in February, when the campaign's top scorer Dick Rowley was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a33,750, the club's second highest transfer fee to date after the \u00a33,860 received for Bill Rawlings two years earlier. In March the club signed forward Thomas Groves from Blakenall and Scottish half-back Alex Sharp from Ayr United, with Warren also returning on professional terms. Just before the end of the season, Oswald Littler left Southampton to join Southern League side Guildford City.", "!scope=\"row\"|Oswald Littler", "!scope=\"row\"|Oswald Littler", "!scope=\"row\"|Oswald Littler", "|align=\"left\"|Oswald Littler"]}]}}
