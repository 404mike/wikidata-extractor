Beardsley added his second of the game in first-half injury-time, turning on the edge of the area before curling the ball into the far corner of the goal to give the hosts a two-goal advantage going into the interval. Reid added Stevenage's fourth goal of the game when he poked the ball past the onrushing Kean. The goal was wrongly accredited as a Neal Trotman own goal, with there being \"conclusive proof\" that Reid made contact with the ball. The away side replied with their second of the match almost instantly, David Ball turning sharply before placing a shot that went in off of the post. A week later, Stevenage travelled to Oldham Athletic, earning a 1\u20131 draw.

Darius Charles added a fifth goal for the home side in the second-half with a low finish from just inside the area after Lawrie Wilson had squared the ball across goal. Sheffield Wednesday added a consolation goal with fifteen minutes remaining through Gary Madine. The visitors were reduced to ten men late on when Jermaine Johnson received a straight red card for an off the ball incident with Scott Laird. Four days later, Stevenage lost their first home game of the campaign, losing 2\u20130 to Notts County. Craig Reid had missed a penalty for the home side in the first-half, before goals from Lee Hughes and Ben Burgess gave the visitors all three points.

Chesterfield doubled their advantage ten minutes later when Jordan Bowery capitalised a defensive mix-up to curl in a shot from the edge of the area. Stevenage scored two goals within the space of two second-half minutes to draw level. Firstly, Scott Laird prodded home Joel Byrom's corner to half the deficit, before Laird fired in a cross that was neatly turned in by Craig Reid.
