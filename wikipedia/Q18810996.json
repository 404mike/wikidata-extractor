Saward also rewrote portions of the script pertaining to the story-arc, particularly the final confrontation scenes at the end of Part Four.

Doctor Who Magazine was not enthusiastic about the new edit suggesting, that \"...what is special about it is up for debate.\" The reviewer disparaged the new special effects, stating that \"...this is ironic as there are few Doctor Who stories less in need of replacement effects than Enlightenment.
