He won a scholarship to Rochdale Municipal Secondary School before attending Accrington Grammar School. In 1930 he won a history scholarship for Manchester University. Here he was influenced by William Abel Pantin and E. F. Jacob, who helped Roskell gravitate towards medieval history. Roskell was taught a neo-Stubbsian method that sought to use administrative and biographical research in studying constitutional history.He gained a first in 1933 and was awarded an MA a year later. His masters thesis was published by the Chetham Society in 1937 as The Knights of the Shire for the County Palatine of Lancaster, 1377\u20131460. After being awarded a Langton Fellowship in 1935, Roskell studied the Parliament of 1422 at Balliol College, Oxford, for his doctoral thesis. Under the supervision of V. H. Galbraith, he completed this in 1940 (The Commons in the Parliament of 1422) but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War. Roskell served in the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic.Roskell returned to Manchester in 1945 and his thesis was eventually published in 1954. For ten years after 1952 he was Professor of Medieval History at the University of Nottingham before returning to the University of Manchester to take the chair of medieval history. He retired in 1978. In 1968 he was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy.Against the views of Albert Pollard and J. E. Neale, Roskell argued in 1964 that it was in the seventeenth century that Parliament became indispensable to the Crown, not the during the sixteenth. With Linda Clark and Carole Rawcliffe, he edited The History of Parliament that covered the House of Commons from 1386 to 1421. These were published in four volumes in 1992.He married Evelyn Liddle in 1942, with whom he had two children. He died on 1 May 1998.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wonderful Parliament", "response": ["In the event, as Tuck has said, subsequent royal attempts at a \"policy of rapprochement with France made little headway\". This may, combined with his uncle John of Gaunt's 1385 invasion of Castile, have provoked the planned French invasion of England of 1386. Further, France had recently renewed the Auld Alliance with Scotland, by which the former promised the latter an expeditionary force and 40,000 gold florins. Gaunt was the wealthiest man in England besides the king, and had often put his money to Richard's use. With Gaunt absent in Spain, he could use neither his wealth nor his retinue in defence of his nephew the King when the attacks of the Wonderful Parliament came. Either way, the war with France, such as it was, was the immediate cause of the parliament, being both exorbitantly expensive and demonstrating few military successes for the expense. For Richard, as historian J. S. Roskell put it, it also had the result of creating an \"adversely critical attitude towards the government\" that reflected negatively upon the King.", "Although the court party was swept from power in 1386\u2014when, as J. S. Roskell put it, \"the exercise of royal authority was virtually handed over to a parliamentary commission\"\u2014Richard had a \"violent reaction\" to the proceedings. Roskell also suggests that the affair was not so much an argument about who should rule, King or parliament, as the answer to that being anyone other than the King would have been anachronistic. Rather, it was regarding whose attitude towards parliament would prevail: the King, who saw parliament as being a tool of royal authority, or parliament, who saw themselves as conciliar to the King. In 1388, a number of men close to the King, including Burley and the Mayor of London, Nicholas Brembre were hanged at Tyburn, while Tresillian was discovered hiding in sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. He was dragged into court with cries of 'We have him!' from the mob and, having already been convicted by the Lords Appellant, was summarily hanged naked before his throat was cut. De la Pole avoided such a fate. Even before  Radcot Bridge, he had escaped to Calais, where his brother Edmund was Captain. This was to no avail, as the governor of the town, Sir William Beauchamp, returned him under armed escort to the King. From there\u2014with royal permission\u2014he made his way to Hull and took ship for Dordrecht. Arriving in Paris by December 1387, he died there two years later; he never returned to England even after Richard resumed his personal authority in May 1389.   "]}, {"page": "E. F.

Maitland, and the subsequent school of more socio-political medieval historiography, to which J. S. Roskell, K.B. McFarlane and C. A. J. Armstrong belonged. His professorships at Manchester and Oxford did much to make the two schools England's academic centres for medieval studies."]}, {"page": "St Anselm Hall", "response": ["* J. S.

Neale", "response": ["His painstaking research uncovered the political power of the gentry in The Elizabethan House of Commons (1949), whilst his 1948 Raleigh Lecture on \u2018The Elizabethan political scene\u2019 greatly expanded our knowledge of the politics of the reign. The two volumes on Elizabeth I and her Parliaments (1953 and 1957) explored the relationship between the Queen and her Parliaments. These were criticised by Sir Geoffrey Elton who claimed that the main preoccupation of these parliaments was the forming of Bills and the passing of Acts, not conflict between Crown and Parliament.G. R. Elton, 'Parliament in the Sixteenth Century: Functions and Fortunes', The Historical Journal, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Jun., 1979), pp. 255-278. Neale's claims that these parliaments were a landmark in the evolution of Parliament was criticised by medievalists such as J. S. Roskell.J. S. Roskell, 'Perspectives in English Parliamentary History', Bulletin of the John Rylands Library, XLVI (1964), pp. 448-475. However Collinson notes that the conflicts which Neale wrote about did take place and that Neale's retelling of them made an exciting and unforgettable chapter in English history."]}, {"page": "William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville", "response": ["Bonville's father died when his son was four, and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household. Grandfather Bonville died in 1408, while Bonville was still legally a minor. As was customary, King Henry IV took both Bonville's wardship and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable royal patronage, which the King granted firstly to Sir John Tiptoft, and then to Edward, Duke of York. Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of Robert, Baron Poynings. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian J. S. Roskell has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage."]}, {"page": "The History of Parliament", "response": ["The next section to appear was that for 1790\u20131820, which had originally been the work of Professor Arthur Aspinall before his death in 1972, and had been taken over by R.

Roskell, Linda Clark and Carole Rawcliffe were jointly responsible for the section covering 1386\u20131421. By the mid-1990s many libraries and users of the History were struggling to cope with the 23 large volumes, and there had been new historical discoveries leading to revisions in the biographies of some Members included in previous volumes.

S. Roskell has suggested due to \"a bellicose engagement\" \u2013 Stafford lost a hand and used a prosthesis; the antiquarian William Dugdale later called him \"Humphrey Stafford with the Silver Hand.\" Although the date of this occurrence is unknown, he was an active soldier at the turn of the fifteenth century; there were, therefore, plenty of opportunities for him to have lost a limb. He served as a Lancer for the Earl of Stafford, and in January 1400 he joined his uncle Ralph Stafford in suppressing the Epiphany Rising against the new king, King Henry IV. He took part in the English invasion of Scotland later that summer, and by 1403 had been retained by the Prince of Wales.Castor, H., The King, the Crown and the Duchy of Lancaster (Oxford, 2004), 217, n. 114. Present at the Battle of Shrewsbury, he fought with the Prince in a party of 'four esquires and 100 archers.' Possibly as a result of this service, he was granted an annuity by Henry in 1406, and Humphrey continued serving Henry in Wales in the long campaign against Owain Glynd\u0175r's rebellion, for instance taking part in the siege of Aberystwyth in 1407. Most recently it has been suggested that it was in Henry's Welsh service \u2013 possibly at this siege \u2013 that he lost his hand, and replaced it \"with an artificial one made out of silver\"."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 1960s", "response": ["* Professor J.
