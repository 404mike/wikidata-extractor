He was first educated at St. Andrews, and proceeded M.A. there. Later he went to France, and studied physic at Paris and Montpellier. He intended taking a medical degree at Padua; but the plague kept him from Italy, and he finally graduated M.D. at Valence in Dauphiny on 7 May 1657. On 27 March 1660 Bruce was incorporated doctor of physic at Oxford. He was associated with his great-uncle, Sir John Wedderburne, in the office of physician to the Duke and Duchess of York. But after fulfilling, in consequence of Wedderburne's infirmities, all the duties of the post for many years, he resigned the office and travelled abroad. Subsequently, he settled at Edinburgh, and was there 'in good repute for his practice.' Wood speaks of him as still living in Edinburgh in 1690. Bruce was admitted candidate of the College of Physicians on 24 December 1660, and was an original member of the Royal Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Bruce", "response": ["David Bruce may refer to:", "* David Bruce (actor) (1914\u20131976), American film actor", "* David Bruce (composer) (born 1970), British composer", "* David Bruce (musician), Australian singer, percussionist and composer", "* David Bruce (bridge) (1900\u20131965), American contract bridge player in the 1930s", "* David Bruce (physician) (fl. 1660s), Scottish physician", "* David Bruce (microbiologist) (1855\u20131931), Scottish pathologist and microbiologist", "* David II of Scotland (1324\u20131371), David Bruce, King of Scots, son of King Robert the Bruce", "* David Bruce (captain) (1816\u20131903), British master mariner", "* David Bruce (minister) (1824\u20131911), Presbyterian minister, journalist", "* David Bruce (brewer) (born 1948), British entrepreneur, founder of the Firkin Brewery pub chain", "* David Bruce (ice hockey) (born 1964), Canadian National Hockey League player", "* David Bruce (inventor), American industrialist and inventor", "* David Bruce Winery, an American winery"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| David Bruce||20/05/1663||fl 1657-1690 Original, Physician", "| David Bruce||01/06/1899||29 May 1855 \u2013 27 November 1931"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the University of St Andrews", "response": ["| David Bruce"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1663", "response": ["*David Bruce (1657\u20131690)"]}, {"page": "List of original fellows of the Royal Society", "response": ["* David Bruce"]}]}}
