He was born in Barking in Essex.\nAs a young man, Hayes was an actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Later he worked for the BBC in various roles, beginning as a studio manager for the World Service, and working his way up to directing for television.Perhaps his most notable work was directing the hugely successful BBC drama adaptations of various Shakespeare plays, collectively entitled An Age of Kings, in 1960. Like many TV drama professionals, after retirement he became better remembered for his work in television science fiction. Amongst Hayes\u2019s many other credits, he directed three Doctor Who serials starring Tom Baker, including 1979\u2019s City of Death, widely considered by fans to be one of the series' best stories. He also helmed the BBC\u2019s 1961 adaptation of A for Andromeda.\nFrom 1986 to 1994 he was a newsreader for the World Service.
