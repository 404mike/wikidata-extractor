Despite growing up in Australia Blatchford made the decision to race for the United Kingdom in 2004. This was done based on her desire to qualify for the 2004 Olympics and that the British women at the time were not as strong as the Australian women. Additionally, her coach, Brett Sutton, was not supported by Triathlon Australia. However, in her years of ITU racing she missed qualifying for three Olympics.
