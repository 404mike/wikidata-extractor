In May 2008 he was selected for the Wales' squad for the 2008 Tour of South Africa, making his debut as a substitute in the 2nd test on 14 June. Wales lost 37\u201321. He kept his place in the squad throughout the 2008\u201309 season and on 14 November, he made his first start against Canada. Wales won 34\u201313. He came on as a replacement in the 18th minute for Jamie Roberts in the match against the Wallabies. Critics thought this would affect Wales but Bishop held his own as Wales won 21\u201318, the only win that for Northern Hemisphere against one of The Big Three. Bishop then came on as a substitute against Scotland in the Six Nations. He it was his only game time in the tournament, although he was an unused replacement against England. Bishop then started for Wales on their North America tour opener against Canada. The Welsh team were missing players due to the Lions tour and injuries but still won 32\u201323. Bishop then started against United States. Wales won 48\u201315.\nOn 18 January 2010 he was named in the 35 man Wales national Squad for the 2010 Six Nations tournament. He was on the bench for every game, only coming on against Ireland.\nOn 8 October Bishop was forced to retire because of a recurring back injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Llantrisant", "response": ["* Andrew Bishop, Bradley Davies and Scott Andrews, Wales' international rugby union players."]}, {"page": "Ospreys (rugby union)", "response": ["| Andrew Bishop", "* Andrew Bishop: (2008\u20132012)", "*Andrew Bishop: (2005\u20132015) (209)"]}, {"page": "Neath RFC", "response": ["*  Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "Treorchy Comprehensive School", "response": ["* Andrew Bishop \u2013 Former professional Rugby Union Player for Wales and Ospreys"]}, {"page": "Bridgend Ravens", "response": ["*  Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "Bishop (surname)", "response": ["* Andrew Bishop (born 1985), Welsh international rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 EDF Energy Cup", "response": ["| ||12||  Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "Gerald Cleaver (musician)", "response": ["Under the name Veil of Names, Cleaver released an album called Adjust on the  Fresh Sound New Talent label in 2001.

However, he was not named in the 22-man squad for any of Wales's five matches in the competition. He returned to the Wales team on their summer tour of New Zealand, coming on as a substitute for Jamie Roberts for the last 10 minutes of the first Test on 19 June. An injury to Andrew Bishop prior to the second Test the following weekend saw Davies and Roberts renew their centre partnership, though this time Davies occupied the outside position. Davies spearheaded one of Wales's best attacks of the game, but attempted to go solo for the goal line instead of offloading to one of three supporting runners with the line at their mercy.", "On 21 October 2010, Davies was again named in the Wales squad for the Autumn international series, but he was preferred for each of the games by a combination of James Hook, Tom Shanklin and Andrew Bishop."]}, {"page": "Jamie Roberts", "response": ["After the game against South Africa, Blues coach Dai Young gave Roberts a chance in the position and he was named in the Welsh squad for the Autumn Internationals. For the first match against The Springboks, Roberts was selected at outside centre in a fourth new position for Wales in as many tests. He would be moved to inside centre as Gavin Henson pulled out with an injury and Tom Shanklin moved to outside centre. Wales lost the game 20\u201315., with Roberts having a quiet game on his 22nd birthday. Roberts was then named on the bench for the match against The Canucks. Wales won 34\u201313 with Roberts appearing as substitute., Roberts then returned for the match with The All Blacks. He played a better role in this with his crash ball getting over the gainline more. Wales lost the game though 29\u20139. He was once again selected at inside centre for the match against Australia, but Roberts collided with Aussie skipper Stirling Mortlock in the second minute of the game. Mortlock was immediately replaced but Roberts initially played on and was crucial in the build-up to Shane Williams' opening Wales try but the 22-year-old was later replaced by Andrew Bishop in the 18th minute. Wales finally claimed a victory over a southern hemisphere team, winning 21\u201318. After the game Roberts was rushed into hospital with a suspected fractured skull. This was later confirmed and he would be out for two months.", "Roberts was selected for the Heineken Cup match against Toulouse in Cardiff. The Blues won 15\u20139 in a lacklustre match. In another lacklustre match, Toulouse claimed a 23\u20137 win, a blow to the Blues' quarter final hopes. He then played in the 42\u201313 win over rivals the Dragons. He also picked up a shoulder injury in this match and would miss the second derby match against the Ospreys. The understrength Blues were hammered 26\u20130. On 5 January 2010, Roberts signed a new contract with the Blues that would keep him at the region until at least 2013. After playing well in Blues 36\u201319 win over Sale Sharks, the Blues faced the probability of being knocked out of the Heineken Cup. And if they did not get a result against Harlequins, they would be knocked out of Europe altogether, and not be included in the European Challenge Cup. Roberts was also facing competition for his Welsh jersey, with James Hook and Andrew Bishop forming an excellent centre partnership at the Ospreys. But the Blues ended their Heineken Cup on a high note by beating Harlequins, 45\u201320, with Roberts hitting back at the critics with two tries, his first of the season. And although they were knocked out of the Heineken Cup, they did qualify for the Challenge Cup, by finishing second in their group.", "There was plenty of competition for a place in the centres, with Roberts, James Hook, Andrew Bishop and Jonathan Davies all looking capable of doing a good job. There was also a dilemma over Lee Byrne, who was set to be banned for the England game, meaning Hook would play at full back again, even though the Welsh public were demanding for him to be played in the centre position. Lee Byrne overturned his ban and Roberts and Hook were selected in the centres with Roberts returning to his natural position of 12, having played two games at his less favoured position of 13 in the autumn.", "Roberts was selected for the Welsh squad to go on tour to New Zealand and to take on South Africa on 5 June. It looked as if he would partner Andrew Bishop with James Hook take the tour off as he headed for shoulder surgery. But Hook delayed it by a week to play the Springboks and partnered Roberts for the sixth time in a row. In a decent match, Wales lost 31\u201334. Roberts had a great game combining excellently with Hook, getting over gainline a lot and putting in some decent tackles. This was not enough as Wales were outmuscled at the breakdown. Roberts was then partnered with Andrew Bishop in the centre for the first test against the All Blacks. Roberts was once again in defence, and made some breaks but it was again in vain as Wales were outmuscled by New Zealand going down 42\u20139 in the final ever test in Carisbrook. Roberts was taken off in the 69th minute with a shoulder injury but was deemed fine to play in the next test. His centre partner Bishop however picked up a hand injury, ruling him out of the next test. He was replaced by Jonathan Davies who played in the number 13 jersey. Wales lost the second test 29\u201310 but put in a slightly improved display. Roberts had another decent game once again putting in brutal tackles, making loads of tackle busts and breaks and got his 2nd test try as reward, Wales' first test try since 2006 against the All Blacks. He could have had another one but was held up over the line."]}, {"page": "2009 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["|CE ||21||Andrew Bishop", "|WG ||21||Andrew Bishop  "]}, {"page": "2010 June rugby union tests", "response": ["| ||22||Andrew Bishop", "| ||13|| Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "2010 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["|IC ||12||Andrew Bishop", "|CE ||21||Andrew Bishop", "|IC ||12||Andrew Bishop || ", "|CE ||22||Andrew Bishop || "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Pro12", "response": ["| ||13||  Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "2012 June rugby union tests", "response": ["|OC ||13||Andrew Bishop", "|OC ||13||Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "2012 Wales rugby union tour of Australia", "response": ["|OC ||13||Andrew Bishop", "|OC ||13||Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "2008 Australia rugby union tour", "response": ["|align=right|  Andrew Bishop||align=right|C||align=center|22||W||Lote Tuqiri "]}, {"page": "2009 Australia national rugby union team tour", "response": ["|WG ||21||Andrew Bishop || || "]}, {"page": "2008 New Zealand rugby union tour", "response": ["|align=right|Andrew Bishop||align=right| ||align=center|22||||Isaia Toeava"]}, {"page": "2008 Wales rugby union tour of South Africa", "response": ["|align=right|  Frans Steyn||align=right|C||align=center|21||C||Andrew Bishop "]}, {"page": "2008 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe", "response": ["|align=right|Andrew Bishop||align=right| ||align=center|22||C||Jaque Fourie  "]}, {"page": "2008 Canada rugby union tour of Europe", "response": ["|align=right|Andrew Bishop||align=right|C||align=center|12||C||Ryan Smith"]}, {"page": "List of 2015\u201316 Pro12 transfers", "response": ["* Andrew Bishop retired"]}, {"page": "Leicester Tigers in cup finals", "response": ["| ||12||  Andrew Bishop", "|IC ||12|| Andrew Bishop"]}, {"page": "Bishop, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Bishop"]}]}}
