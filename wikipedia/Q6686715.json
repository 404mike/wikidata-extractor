The Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton had wanted to cancel the programme after the initial episode, but was faced with legal action from Cook. It transpired in a subsequent meeting that the budget for the series had already been spent by Cook. Cotton told Cook that \"Money I can deal with. Bad shows are far more difficult\". The viewership rose across the three episodes; Cook's biographer, Harry Thompson felt that the rising audience was indicative of the public \"enjoy[ing] watching disaster unfold...or at least being appalled by it\"."]}]}}
