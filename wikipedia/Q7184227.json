He also designed the Skylon and the Churchill Gardens housing estate in Pimlico.\nHe founded a practice with Hidalgo Moya, Powell & Moya Architect Practice. Peter Skinner joined the practice in 1948 and later became a partner. They won a competition to build Churchill Gardens, Pimlico, a complex that houses 5,000 people in 1,800 flats. They were aged 24 and 23 respectively. They were then invited by Frederick Gibberd to design a housing project in Harlow New Town. Northbrooks sits imposingly above a valley to the south of the town centre, affording good views from and to the four-storey slab blocks. However, arguments with Harlow Design Corporation over the use of flat roofs led to the pair terminating their involvement prior to completion. They undertook no more work in the town, much to the disappointment of Gibberd, who had lectured them at the Architects' Association School.\nThey designed the Skylon Installation at the 1951 Festival of Britain, which sought to instil a sense of positive feeling at a time of postwar depression.\nPowell designed Mayfield School for Girls, West Hill, Putney, London, S.W.15.; a number of Oxford and Cambridge University buildings including Wolfson College, Oxford and at Christ Church, the courtyard at the Museum of London and Chichester Festival Theatre.\nIn 1974, Powell and Moya became the first to win the RIBA Gold Medal for architecture as a Practice.\nPowell was knighted in 1975 after years of dedicated work as a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission.  He died in London.\nNational Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/11) with Philip Powell in 1997 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St John's College, Cambridge", "response": ["Further increases in student numbers following WWII prompted the college to again increase the number of accommodation buildings.

It is considered an exemplar of late 20th-century architectural style and is named after its main benefactor, Humphrey Cripps.

In 1969, this work was trimmed and modified to make space for a further new building created by Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya using a modernist beehive design, while leaving Jackson's Annexe substantially intact. Powell and Moya's building uses local limestone rubble and has the architects' characteristically large windows mounted within an exposed concrete frame. Particular attention was paid to placing the design within the existing architectural context, including the plain wall of Oriel College, Merton's Gothic chapel and Jackson's heavily ornamented Annexe.

A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the market town of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as Old Harlow, and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and pubs. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, Leonard Manasseh, Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew, Graham Dawbarn, H. T. Cadbury-Brown and William Crabtree.  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.
