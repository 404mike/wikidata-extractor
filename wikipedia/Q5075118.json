Corporal (then Private) Charles Anderson, Date of Acts of Bravery, October 8th, 1858For saving the life of Lieutenant-Colonel Seymour, C.B., commanding the regiment, in an attack made on him on the 8th of October, 1858, by mutinous sepoys, in a dense jungle of sugar canes, from which an attempt was made to dislodge them. The mutineers were between 30 and 40 in number. They suddenly opened fire on Lieutenant-Colonel Seymour and his party at a few yards distance, and immediately afterwards rushed in upon them with drawn (native) swords. Pistolling a man, cutting at him, and emptying with deadly effect at arm's length every barrel of his revolver, Lieutenant-Colonel Seymour was cut down by two sword cuts, when the two men above recommended, rushed to his rescue, and the Trumpeter shooting a man with his pistol in the act of cutting at him, and both Trumpeter and Dragoon driving at the enemy with their swords, enabled him to arise, and assist in defending himself again, when the whole of the enemy were dispatched. The occurrence took place soon after the action fought near Sundeela, Oudh, on the date abovementioned.\nHe later achieved the rank of corporal.

Eleven months later they engaged the invading Japanese when they were rushed forward to support the beleaguered 2/29th Battalion at Baku. Australian anti-tank gunners destroyed nine Japanese tanks in the Baku area. The 2/19th held a vital crossroad allowing the 2/29th and the 45th Indian Brigade to withdraw to Muar. Their action resulted in them being outflanked by superior numbers and they had to fight their way through a succession of Japanese roadblocks. The Australians' six-day clash with the crack 5th Imperial Guards Division was one of the epic encounters of the Malaya campaign.  British commander Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, considered the delay they imposed had saved a large part of his army from being cut-off and annihilated at Yong Peng. With ammunition exhausted, casualties mounting and no chance of relief the 2/19th struck out through the jungle leaving wounded behind. It was later learned all the wounded were murdered by Lieutenant General Takuma Nishimura's Guards in what became known as the Parit Sulong Massacre. Nishimura was hanged in 1951 for war crimes. 2/19th commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anderson was awarded the Victoria Cross for his courage and leadership."]}]}}
