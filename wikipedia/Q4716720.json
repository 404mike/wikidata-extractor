The emergence of Alec Kennedy and Jack Newman during this period under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson led to stronger Hampshire performances, with Hampshire winning all three matches played at the ground in the 1921 season.  The Combined Services played only their second ever first-class match in that same season against the Australians.  Later in the 1920s, the Royal Navy played first-class cricket at the ground for the first time, against the 1927 touring New Zealanders. The first hat trick at the ground was taken by Stuart Boyes in 1925. Hampshire continued to play at the ground throughout the thirties, at a time when following the retirements of George Brown, Phil Mead, Jack Newman and Lord Tennyson Hampshire were a less successful team.  Hampshire played four matches per season there during the thirties, with the exception of 1938 when they played five matches, before returning to four in 1939. Hampshire record partnership for the fifth wicket was made there in 1937, when Gerry Hill and Donald Walker put on 235, a record which stands to this day. World War II ended county cricket until 1946, and during the war Portsmouth was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe during The Blitz."]}, {"page": "Norman Bowell", "response": ["Bowell was the son of Alex Bowell, who played 475 first-class matches for Hampshire from 1902 until 1927, scoring over 18,000 runs."]}, {"page": "East of England cricket team", "response": ["* Alex Bowell (1910)"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 10th || 192 || Alex Bowell & Walter Livsey || Worcestershire || Dean Park, Bournemouth || 1921"]}, {"page": "Henry Crichton (cricketer)", "response": ["Crichton made two first-class appearances for Warwickshire in the 1908 County Championship against Sussex and Hampshire.
