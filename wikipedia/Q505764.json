He also won the singles championship at Wimbledon once, in 1888 and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983. He won the singles title at the Irish Championships on four occasions (1883, 1887, 1888, 1892). Ernest was the older of the brothers by 15 minutes and half an inch taller.\nThe boom in popularity of the game during the 1880s due to the modern tennis style of the Renshaw brothers became known as the 'Renshaw Rush'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 3", "response": ["* 1861 \u2013 Ernest Renshaw, English tennis player (d. 1899)"]}, {"page": "1899", "response": ["* September 2 \u2013 Ernest Renshaw, British tennis player (b. 1861)"]}, {"page": "1882 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Ernest Renshaw (GB) 6\u20131 2\u20136 4\u20136 6\u20132 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "1883 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Ernest Renshaw (GB) 2\u20136 6\u20133 6\u20133 4\u20136 6\u20133"]}, {"page": "1887 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 Herbert Lawford (GB) defeats Ernest Renshaw (GB) 1\u20136 6\u20133 3\u20136 6\u20134 6\u20134"]}, {"page": "1888 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 Ernest Renshaw (GB) defeats Herbert Lawford (GB) 6\u20133 7\u20135 6\u20130"]}, {"page": "1889 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Ernest Renshaw (GB) 6\u20134 6\u20131 3\u20136 6\u20130"]}]}}
