The album was generally well received by critics \u2013 Billboard magazine described it as featuring \"a strong rock personality\" and dubbed it \"a candidate for big chart action\", while journalist Nigel Williamson hailed it as \"a classic period example of English prog, mixing pastoral whimsy, swirling psychedelia, rock guitars and pop harmonies\".

The style of the album has been described by commentators as a mix between progressive rock, psychedelic rock and pop rock, with AllMusic's Bruce Eder claiming that \"Those listeners who only know the subsequent albums by Trapeze may be surprised by this debut effort\" due to their later hard rock style. The album was compared stylistically to the work of other British rock acts of the period, including Lodge's band the Moody Blues and Hughes's future group Deep Purple (particularly the first three albums). In the liner notes for a 2004 reissue of the album by Lemon Recordings, journalist Nigel Williamson described Trapeze as \"a classic period example of English prog, mixing pastoral whimsy, swirling psychedelia, rock guitars and pop harmonies\".

People in the music industry have also called it the first, among several others. \"Rocket 88\" is cited for its forceful backbeat and unrefined, distorted electric guitar. By contrast, writer and musician Michael Campbell wrote that, \"from our perspective,\" it was not the first rock and roll record because it had a shuffle beat rather than the rock rhythm originally characteristic in Chuck Berry's and Little Richard's songs, although he added that \"Rocket 88\" had basic characteristics of rock music such as the emphasis on guitar and distortion. Its characterization as a rock and roll or rhythm and blues song continues to be debated.

Nigel Williamson of Uncut compliments Harrison and Spector for retaining the imperfections of the live recordings and thereby conveying the spirit of the all-star concerts. He views Dylan's set as \"spellbinding\" and a final reprise of the singer's \"mythic voice-of-a-generation image\", and concludes of the album: \"seldom before or since has rock music sounded so honest, so caring \u2013 and so capable of making us smile and cry at the same time.\"Nigel Williamson, \"George Solo: Concert for Bangladesh\", Uncut Ultimate Music Guide: George Harrison, TI Media (London, 2018), pp. 62\u201363."]}, {"page": "All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)", "response": ["\"All My Love\" is a mid-tempo rock-style ballad, that biographer Nigel Williamson describes as \"underpinned by a semi-classical arrangement of the kind popular at the time with the likes of Genesis and ELO\".
