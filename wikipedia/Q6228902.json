These scrapbooks were donated to The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1902 by his sister, Emma Wolstenholme.The standard author abbreviation J.Day is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.Day was born in the City of London in 1824, the son of a wealthy wine merchant. He bought his first collection of orchids in 1852 at an auction of the stock of Loddiges nursery upon its closure. At an average price of \u00a31 each, he acquired 50 tropical orchids, not the more common Cymbidiums, but Dendrobiums from India, Odontoglossums from tropical America, Lycastes, and Cattleyas, which he grew under ideal conditions in an orchid house built with an exemplary heating system, in the grounds of his home at High Cross, Tottenham.\nBetween 1863 and 1888 at the height of orchid mania in Victorian England, John Day painted and sketched orchids from his own collection in Tottenham, London nurseries, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and visited the tropics to see orchid habitat at first hand. A large number of his illustrations depict plants he had coaxed into flower and are the first-known images of species. He maintained close links with Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach, the orchid taxonomist at the University of Hamburg.\nIn 2004 Thames and Hudson published a collection of John Day's artwork in A Very Victorian Passion: The Orchid Paintings of John Day by Phillip Cribb and Michael Tibbs, two leading authorities on Orchidaceae, who provide a detailed review of the history, background, and botany of the orchids depicted.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Day", "response": ["John Day, John Daye or Jon Day may refer to:", "*John Day (Nova Scotia legislator) (died 1775), merchant and politician in Nova Scotia", "*John Day Jr. (died 1792), soldier and political figure in Nova Scotia", "*John Day (judge) (1797\u20131859), Liberian politician and judge", "*John Day (Indiana politician) (born 1937), Democratic member of the Indiana House of Representatives", "*John Day (Australian politician) (born 1955), Western Australian politician", "*John Day (cricketer, born 1812), English cricketer", "*John Day (horseman) (1819\u20131883), English jockey and trainer", "*John Day (cricketer, born 1881) (1881\u20131949), English cricketer", "*John Day (merchant) (fl. 1497\u201398), English merchant, author of a letter referring to existence of lost book Inventio Fortunata", "*John Day (printer) (c. 1522\u20131584), English Protestant printer, also known as John Daye", "*John Day (dramatist) (1574\u2013c. 1638), English dramatist", "*John Day (carpenter) (died 1774), first recorded death in a submarine", "*John Day (trapper) (c. 1770\u20131820), American hunter and trapper", "*John Day (architect) (fl. 1798\u20131802), Irish architect from County Wexford", "*John Day (priest) (1802\u20131879), clergyman in the Church of Ireland", "*John Day (botanist) (1824\u20131888), Victorian orchid collector and illustrator", "*John Day (historian) (1924\u20132003), American historian", "*John Day (computer scientist) (born 1947), ARPANET pioneer and early RFC contributor", "*John Day (RAF officer) (born 1947), British air marshal", "*John Day (Old Testament scholar) (born 1948), professor of Old Testament Studies", "*John Day, Oregon, a city ", "*John Day River, a tributary of the Columbia River in northeastern Oregon", "*John Day River (northwestern Oregon), a different tributary of the Columbia River", "*John Day (film), a 2013 Indian film", "*John Day Company, a New York publisher founded in 1926", "*John Day Dam, a dam on the Columbia River", "*John Day Fossil Beds National Monument"]}, {"page": "Loddiges family", "response": ["On the death of George Loddiges in 1846, the nursery business passed to his son Conrad Loddiges II (1821\u20131865), who found it increasingly difficult to negotiate a new lease from the land-owner (St. Thomas' Hospital), given the much higher prices the land could now command for housing development, due to London's growth into the surrounding countryside. Similarly, the part of the nursery that was owned by the Loddiges family in freehold, was becoming more valuable as building land, whilst losing its attractive countryside village setting. Conrad was involved with the display of ferns and terrariums for the Great Exhibition. The nursery closed in stages between 1852 and 1854 due to expiry of the lease from St. Thomas' Hospital. Conrad Loddiges II offered the whole of the exotic plant stock to Kew Gardens for a sum of \u00a39000 (20 years earlier the collection was valued at \u00a3200,0000) but this was refused. Many rare plants were auctioned via Stevens auctioneers, including rare orchids sold to John Day who would later become famous as a botanical illustrator. Joseph Paxton purchased 300 palms and plants for the opening of the new Crystal Palace at Sydenham. The Illustrated London News of 5 August 1854 illustrated plumed horses pulling a giant palm tree through the City of London on its way to be prominently displayed by Paxton in time for the opening of the Crystal Palace by Queen Victoria."]}, {"page": "List of orchidologists", "response": ["* John Day (botanist) (1824\u20131888), an English orchid-grower and collector, and is noted for producing some 4000 illustrations of orchid species"]}, {"page": "J.Day", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Day (botanist)"]}, {"page": "Odontoglossum crispum", "response": ["Odontoglossum crispum appears frequently in the illustrations of John Day in his scrapbooks \u2013 40 times between 1865 and 1887.
