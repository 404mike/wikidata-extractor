He was previously a football player for several years with the same club and a player manager of Welsh club Bangor City.\nAn apprentice fitter before he became a footballer, Smith was on the books at Middlesbrough for four years before he made his first team debut. His debut came as a substitute in a 4\u20132 win over Bristol City in March 1966. He was in and out of the side for much of his career. He was transfer listed in May 1967 but stuck around, turning down a move to Blackburn Rovers in September 1971.\nSmith eventually left Teesside in June 1972, becoming player-manager of Welsh side Bangor City. He returned to league football with Darlington in 1974.\nHe later fixed his sights on Non-League football, where his posts included a stint as player-coach with the Guisborough Town side that reached the FA Vase final, as well as being assistant to former Middlesbrough defender Peter Creamer at Evenwood Town in 1991. He later ran a sports shop, before returning to Middlesbrough during the 1996\u201397 season as their kit manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["Alex Smith (born 1984) is an American football quarterback.", "Alex Smith may also refer to:", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131954), Scottish international footballer (Rangers)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u2013?), Scottish footballer (Liverpool)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1938), English football goalkeeper (Halifax Town)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1939), Scottish footballer and manager (St. Mirren, Aberdeen, Dundee United)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1940), Scottish footballer (Dunfermline Athletic, Rangers)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1944), English footballer (Middlesbrough)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1947), English footballer (Bradford City, Southend United)", "*Alex Smith (New Zealand footballer), New Zealand international footballer", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1976), English footballer (Port Vale, Wrexham)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1985), English footballer (FC Dallas, Sydney Olympic, Wellington Phoenix)", "*Alex Smith (footballer, born 1991), English footballer (Yeovil Town)", "*Alex Smith (golfer) (1874\u20131930), member of a famous Scottish golfing family", "*Alex Smith (ice hockey) (1902\u20131963), Canadian NHL hockey player", "*Alex Smith (tight end) (born 1982), American football tight end", "*Alex Smith (hammer thrower) (born 1988), British hammer thrower", "*Alex Smith (builder) (1899\u20131973), Australian heritage designer-builder on the Redcliffe Peninsula", "*Alex Smith (engineer) (1922\u20132003), Scottish industrial scientist and educator", "*Alex Smith (politician) (born 1943), Labour MEP for South of Scotland", "*Alex Smith (entrepreneur) (born 1986), Indiana philanthropist", "*Alex Smith, member of British comedy trio Hat Films"]}, {"page": "Alex Smith (kit manager)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alex Smith (footballer, born 1944)"]}, {"page": "Alex Smith (footballer born 1944)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alex Smith (footballer, born 1944)"]}]}}
