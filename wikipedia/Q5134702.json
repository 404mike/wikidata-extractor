Their collaboration arose out of a mutual interest in mental time travel and resulted in Clayton and Wilkins co-founding \"The Captured Thought~ an arts/science collaboration.\" Their work and lectures explore the subjective experience of thinking, by drawing evidence from both science and the arts to examine perception and the nature of mental time travel, as well as the mechanisms we use to think about the future and reminisce about the past. The goal of this project is to illuminate ideas concerning memories and question the power of analysis. Important aspects of The Captured Thought's work have been highlighted in articles in 'The Guardian' newspaper in 2019 The Guardian.
