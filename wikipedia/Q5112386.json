Gaffney (born 14 June 1962) is a British archaeological geophysicist  and currently Head of the School of Archaeological and Forensics Sciences at the University of Bradford. \nGaffney's research interests are based on understanding how geophysical data can aide archaeology in the understanding of the life and culture of ancient peoples.  In pursuing these research goals he has pursued research in challenging environments where technical excellence and novel methodological approaches can lead to enhanced interpretation of the past.  In doing so, Gaffney has undertaken research and managed surveys within Britain and across the world. These have included research projects across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.  Significant research projects include work his work as part of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, research on World Heritage Sites at Diocletian\u2019s Palace, Split, in Croatia and at Fountains Abbey, UK, the Greek colony at Megara Hyblaea (Sicily) and ancient Cyrene  in Libya. More recently he has participated in major projects directed at broader cultural issues including the Curious Travellers project, utilising web-scraping technologies to reconstruct heritage under threat, but also projects which have sought to understand", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Christopher Gaffney (born 1962) British; geophysics"]}, {"page": "Gaffney", "response": ["* Christopher Gaffney (bishop) (died 1576), Irish bishop", "* Christopher Gaffney (archaeologist) (born 1962), British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Christopher Gaffney (archaeological geophysicist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Gaffney (archaeologist)"]}, {"page": "Gaffney, Christopher", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Gaffney (archaeologist)"]}, {"page": "Vincent Gaffney", "response": ["Born 25 February 1958 in Newcastle upon Tyne, Gaffney was educated at Westgate (Arthurs) Hill School and Rutherford Comprehensive School. His interest in archaeology originated during his days at Westgate Hill Primary School in Newcastle upon Tyne: as part of an annual school trip, his class were taken to the Roman Wall, visiting sites such as the Mithraeum at Carrawbrughs and the forts at Chesters and Housesteads. Encouraged by a grandfather with similar interests, he was fortunate enough to attend the Vindolanda excavations - sponsored by Rutherford Comprehensive - where he experienced archaeology first hand and met Robin and Anthony Birley on the site. His brother Christopher Gaffney also became an archaeologist.", "In 1992, Gaffney was employed at the University of Birmingham, rising from a research fellow at the Birmingham University Field Archaeology Unit (BUFAU) \u2013 later Birmingham Archaeology.  During this time, he established archaeological computing, in academic terms, at the department. In 1996 he received funding from the Leverhulme Trust to study the Roman town at Wroxeter, Viriconium Cornoviorum. As part of a team with Simon Buteux, Roger White, Martin van Leusen and Christopher Gaffney, the Wroxeter Hinterland Project undertook the first complete geophysical survey of a complete Roman Town in Britain, in collaboration with researchers from across the world. The University of Birmingham was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize in 1996 for this research.", "Gaffney's brother, Christopher Gaffney, is also an archaeologist."]}, {"page": "Christopher Gaffney", "response": ["*Christopher Gaffney (bishop) (died 1576), Irish bishop", "* Christopher Gaffney (archaeologist) (born 1962), British archaeologist"]}]}}
