In 1825 he married Caroline Raikes, but they had no children.\nHis father was John Tunno (1746\u20131819), a Scottish-born merchant and slave trader who had made a fortune in Charleston, South Carolina and, after the American Revolution, another in London as a member of Lloyd's of London and a friend of Sir Thomas Baring. His mother was Margaret Rose of Charleston, who married John Tunno in 1781. She was the daughter of John Rose, another Scot descended from the Roses of Clava, in Nairnshire, who had 42,000 acres of rice plantations in South Carolina and interests in Jamaica.Because of his role as executor of his father-in-law's John Rose's plantation interests in Jamaica, he is listed as a claimant for compensation after the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.His coalmine at Llangennech was worked by James Shears from 1824.\nHe was the uncle of the MP Edward John Sartoris (1814\u201388), to whom he bequeathed much of his estate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Shears and Sons", "response": ["Also in 1824 Shears formed the Llangennech Coal Company to work the coal under an estate to the east of Llanelli in south Wales. This estate had been leased from Edward Rose Tunno (1800\u20131863), a rich young man whose income was derived from British and Welsh real estate purchased from his inheritance from his father, John, and uncle Adam, traders of South Carolina. In this concern Shears was joined by his brother and by two London merchants, Thomas Margrave and William Ellwand.M.V. Symons, Coal Mining in the Llanelli Area, vol. 1: 16th Century to 1829 (Llanelli, 1979), pp 121, 164\u20137. The property included the derelict Spitty copperworks which the Shears brothers (on their own) proceeded to re-open in 1824. The following year, on the opposite bank of the river Llwchwr, they built a new zinc works at Loughor (or possibly re-activated an existing one) where they intended to produce zinc using the recently granted patent of 1824.R.O. Roberts and P.R. Reynolds, 'The Early zinc works at Casllwchwr (Loughor) near Swansea', Morgannwg 48 (2004), pp 5\u201334. These two enterprises were obviously intended to be complementary to one another in providing the materials required for the manufacture of brass, part of the core business of James Shears & Sons."]}, {"page": "Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Edward Rose Tunno"]}, {"page": "Edward John Sartoris", "response": ["He was a cousin of the French politician Henri Greffulhe, and a nephew of Edward Rose Tunno."]}, {"page": "Edward Tunno", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Rose Tunno"]}, {"page": "Tunno", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Rose Tunno"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edward Rose Tunno||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edward Rose Tunno||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edward Rose Tunno||Tory"]}, {"page": "Peter Urban Sartoris", "response": ["The son of a Huguenot banker, Jean-Jacques Sartoris, and Anne Greffuhle (aunt of Jean-Henry-Louis Greffulhe), he used to live in Gloucester PlaceThe Monthly Magazine, 1813, Volume 35, p. 455. close to Regent's Park, and married 1813 Hester Matilda Tunno, daughter of the Scottish banker John Tunno (1746-1819) and sister of Edward Rose Tunno.
