In 1825 he married Caroline Raikes, but they had no children.\nHis father was John Tunno (1746\u20131819), a Scottish-born merchant and slave trader who had made a fortune in Charleston, South Carolina and, after the American Revolution, another in London as a member of Lloyds of London and a friend of Sir Thomas Baring. His mother was Margaret Rose of Charleston, who married John Tunno in 1781. She was the daughter of John Rose, another Scot descended from the Roses of Clava, in Nairnshire, who had 42,000 acres of rice plantations in South Carolina and interests in Jamaica.Because of his role as executor of his father-in-law's John Rose's plantation interests in Jamaica, he is listed as a claimant for compensation after the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.His coalmine at Llangennech was worked by James Shears from 1824.\nHe was the uncle of the MP Edward John Sartoris (1814\u201388), to whom he bequeathed much of his estate.", "link_mentions": {}}}
