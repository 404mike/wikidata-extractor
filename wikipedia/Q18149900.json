He had been dining with Mrs Mabel Fredericke, an art dealer of the King's Galleries, when he spotted Dolores and expressed a wish to paint her. The two were soon living together.

Soon I am going to get him to come back.\"", "Later in 1929, she obtained the lead in By Whose Hand? by the British music hall comedian and theatrical impresario Herbert Darnley, a murder story that was staged at the Pavilion Theatre in Leicester.

We are temperamentally suited to each other.\"Whittington-Egan, 1972, p. 265.", "On 7 March, it was announced in the Daily Mail that Drew and Dolores were engaged to be married.

From there they moved to rooms at 44 Cathcart Road, Fulham. Dolores wrote from there to one of the police officers with whom Drew was in contact, asking the officer to visit her as she had something to tell him. When the officer arrived, however, she was unable to talk as Drew was there, managing only a whisper \"I can't tell you now, he's here.\" She never did tell the police what she knew and soon after, the couple separated.Whittington-Egan, 1972, pp. 276\u20137.", "In 1930, Dolores' life story was told in the Hearst Press in America in a series of sensational articles that appeared in newspapers throughout the country.
