He is mostly associated with the New Age genre. He was born in Yorkshire, England. He lives with his wife Wendy in Cornwall, England. According to AllMusic, \"Goodall began composing original songs as a teen, earning local notoriety with his band Trax; in the years to follow, he learned to play a vast range of instruments, including mandolin, piano, drums, harp, flute, glockenspiel, panpipes, vibraphone and synthesizer, and cut his first album at age 26\". He is a prolific recorder, having recorded over 75 albums. He also topped the UK music charts twice and sold over three million albums. His first album was Emergence (1987), published by New World Music. His early albums were published also by Oreade Music. Medwyn Goodall started MG Music in 2003. This is a record label which specializes in New Age music.\nHe produced albums on which he arranged, performed, mixed and mastered every song, although his album, OM (2007), was produced together with Terry Oldfield and OM 2 (2009), was produced together with Aroshanti. There is an updated list of his albums at MG Music and at AllMusic web sites.\nMany of Goodall's recent releases have been under the alias Midori. He explains that he chose this alias so he \"could record projects that were more ethnic, eastern, or produced for the healing arts\" without confusing fans of his other music. However, there are also other musical artists using or known by the name Midori (such as the jazz-punk combo Midori and the Japanese violinist Midori Goto).\nOne of Goodall's tracks, \"Free Spirit\" from his album Meditation & Visualisation (2001) features the same Spectrasonics \"Distorted Reality\" sample featured in the \"Summer Forest\" music in the video game Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!, as composed by Stewart Copeland.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Midori", "response": ["* Midori, an alias of new-age musician Medwyn Goodall"]}, {"page": "List of new-age music artists", "response": ["* Medwyn Goodall \u2013 multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer"]}, {"page": "King Arthur (disambiguation)", "response": ["*King Arthur, a 2004 compilation album by Medwyn Goodall"]}, {"page": "Goodall", "response": ["* Medwyn Goodall (born 1961), British composer and musician"]}, {"page": "Catherine Duc", "response": ["In 2015 she signed a record deal for her album \"Voyager\" with UK based label MG Music (owned by New Age composer and musician Medwyn Goodall) and received a Grammy nomination for 'Best New Age Album'."]}, {"page": "Le Myst\u00e8re des Voix Bulgares", "response": ["The music has been acclaimed by various artists such as Paul Simon, Kate Bush, George Harrison, David Bowie, Frank Zappa, Peter Murphy (of Bauhaus), Elizabeth Fraser (of Cocteau Twins), Bobby McFerrin, Medwyn Goodall, Enrique Morente, the Grateful Dead, Robert Plant and has prompted worldwide interest."]}, {"page": "Robert Hurst (musician)", "response": ["* 1996 King Shaman, Medwyn Goodall"]}, {"page": "Medwyn", "response": ["* Medwyn Goodall (born 1961), English New Age composer and musician"]}]}}
