He was a right-handed batsman, off-spin bowler and wicket-keeper who played for Durham. He was born in Bury St Edmunds.\nLowe's first-class career began following some solid performances in the Second XI in the 2002 season. Lowe made an impressive 80 before being caught lbw in his debut first-class innings the following year, a score which, for as long as he played, would remain his highest score in a First-class match.\nHowever, Lowe played only four matches in the next three years for the first team, instead playing Second XI cricket, while in 2004 Lowe was part of the team which reached the semi-finals of the Second XI Trophy competition. During this same period Lowe represented Philadelphia in the North East Premier League, where he would play until 2006, the year in which he saw out his first-class career.\nLowe is no longer a squad-member as of the 2007 season. Throughout his short career he was an opening batsman, initially full of promise, but released before being able to get into the swing of a regular team place.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Durham County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  James Lowe", "147 from Shahriar Nafees and Nazimuddin's seven-ball 28 - which included three sixes, two fours and a two before he was caught and bowled off Ben Harmison - lifted Bangladesh A to 299 for 6 in 50 overs, despite Neil Killeen removing Tushar Imran and Alok Kapali with successive balls mid-innings.

Durham started with a 40-run opening partnership, but Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain both took two wickets with successive balls, separated by a few overs. Shahadat went on to take four for 34, while Australian Callum Thorp top-scored with 52 - in vain, as Durham posted 213. Durham's captain and opener James Lowe ground out 36 runs from 80 deliveries, well short of the required run rate of 6 per over."]}, {"page": "James Lowe", "response": ["*James Lowe (footballer), Scottish international (1887) who played for St Bernard's", "*James Lowe (rower) (born 1956), Australian rower", "*James Lowe (rugby union) (born 1992), New Zealand rugby union player", "*James Lowe (cricketer) (born 1982), English cricketer", "*James Lowe (musician), member of American band The Electric Prunes", "*James Lowe (conductor) (born 1976), English conductor and violist", "*James Lowe (inventor) (1798\u20131866), English inventor"]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* James Lowe (2003\u20132006) : J.
