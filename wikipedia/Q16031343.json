On 13 October 1918 at Saint-Python, France, when the advance was desperately opposed and the streets of the village were raked by fire, Corporal Wood's platoon sergeant was killed and he took command of the leading platoon. The River Selle had to be crossed and the ruined bridge gained, although the space in front of it was full of snipers, so the corporal carried a very large brick into the open space, lay down behind it and, firing continuously on the snipers, covered his men while they worked their way across. Later in the day he repeatedly drove off enemy counter-attacks.He later achieved the rank of Lance-Sergeant.\nHis nerves were badly affected by his wartime experiences. He died 15 August 1924 whilst on holiday; he was walking with his wife when a car mounted the pavement and headed towards them. His wife pushed him out of the way but she was pinned against the wall. She suffered minor injuries but her husband was so shocked that he collapsed and fell into a coma from which he died several days later. He was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol, England, at Soldiers' Corner, grave number 1738.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of the Scots Guards (1914\u20131945)", "response": ["On 13 October, Lance Corporal Harry Blanshard Wood of the 2nd Battalion, at St. Python, took command of his platoon, the leading platoon of the company, after the platoon sergeant was killed, under very heavy fire, during the advance on the village of St. Python. The company that Corporal Wood was part of, was tasked with taking the western half of the village and to secure the crossing of the River Selle, as well as secure the ruined bridge. However, the space in front of it was covered by snipers, but this did not deter Corporal Wood. The Corporal took a large brick into the open space, lay behind it, and continuously shot at the snipers, ordering his men to get across the open space while he covered them, remaining in the open space until all his men had got across. Later that day, Corporal Wood drove off a number of German counter-attacks on his position, proving his professional and gallant leadership throughout the day. For his actions Corporal Wood was awarded the Victoria Cross, the last VC won by the regiment during the First World War."]}, {"page": "Harry Wood", "response": ["*Harry Blanshard Wood (1882\u20131924), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Arnos Vale Cemetery", "response": ["*Harry Blanshard Wood (VC, MM), World War I hero"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wood", "response": [":* Harry Blanshard Wood (1882\u20131924), British soldier and Victoria Cross recipient"]}, {"page": "Blanshard", "response": ["*Harry Blanshard Wood VC MM (1882\u20131924), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}]}}
