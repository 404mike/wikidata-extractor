Sendak gave advice to Jonze while he adapting the book and the two developed a friendship. The film stars Max Records as Max, a lonely 8-year-old boy who runs away from home after an argument with his mother (played by Catherine Keener) and sails away to an island inhabited by creatures known as the \"Wild Things,\" who declare Max their king. The Wild Things were played by performers in creature suits, while CGI was required to animate their faces. James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, Paul Dano, and Michael Berry Jr. provided the voices for the Wild Things, and Jonze voiced two owls named Bob and Terry. The film's soundtrack was performed by Karen O and composer Carter Burwell scored his third film for Jonze. Where the Wild Things Are was released in October 2009 to a generally positive critical reception but did not perform well at the box office. Some reviewers were unsure whether the film was intended for a younger or adult audience due to its dark tone and level of maturity. Jonze himself said that he \"didn't set out to make a children's movie; I set out to make a movie about childhood\". A television documentary, Tell Them Anything You Want: A Portrait of Maurice Sendak, co-directed by Jonze and Lance Bangs, aired in 2009 and features a series of interviews with Sendak. Jonze wrote and directed We Were Once a Fairytale (2009), a short film starring Kanye West as himself acting belligerently while drunk in a nightclub."]}, {"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl || Walt Disney Pictures / Jerry Bruckheimer Films || Gore Verbinski (director); Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio (screenplay); Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Kevin McNally, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Zoe Saldana, Martin Klebba, David Bailie,  Greg Ellis, Guy Siner, Damian O'Hare, Giles New, Angus Barnett, Michael Berry Jr., Isaac C.
