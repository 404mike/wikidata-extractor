Others were stretchered off following heavy tackles. The East Ham Echo reported: \"From the very first kick of the ball it was seen likely to be some trouble, but the storm burst when Dean and Jarvis came into collision (Millwall had two players sent off during the match). This aroused considerable excitement among the spectators. The crowds on the bank having caught the fever, free fights were plentiful.\"Dunning, p. 68 In 1910 Millwall decided to drop Athletic from their name and move out of East London. With limited expansion space on the Isle of Dogs, the club wanted to boost support and attendances. It moved four miles to The Den, in New Cross, South London.Lindsay, pp. 16\u201317 The last East London derby between the teams was at Millwall's North Greenwich ground on 24 September 1910; West Ham won 2\u20130 with goals from Danny Shea and Fred Blackburn.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 284 Four months later, Millwall travelled to Upton Park as a South London team for the first time. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw. On 9 March 1912, 28,400 supporters saw West Ham's first visit to The Den. The Lions won the game 5\u20131, with their Welsh international striker Wally Davis scoring a hat-trick."]}]}}
