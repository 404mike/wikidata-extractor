Wood wrote that the publisher, Henry Cripps, made such a \"great profit\" off the book that he \"got an estate by it\". Burton's subject was well chosen; similar treatises by Timothie Bright and Thomas Wright had gone through several editions soon after their publication. Though Burton never divulged the extent of his profits, the size of his estate and library at death suggests they were considerable. Burton printed the Anatomy under the pseudonym of \"Democritus Junior\", alluding to the Greek pre-Socratic philosopher, Democritus, sometimes known as the Laughing Philosopher. The use of an established classical figure in a pseudonym was common practice in Burton's time, used to ensure the reader held no negative preconceptions about the author. Burton did not resolutely stick to this pseudonymity; the first edition betrayed it as he signed the \"Conclusion to the Reader\" with his real name, and though this was removed in later editions, the portrait of Burton added from the third edition onwards hardly preserved his anonymity."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Keynes", "response": ["* Dr. Timothie Bright 1550\u20141615.

Johann Ludwig Havenreuter's text is almost identical with a portion of his commentary to the third book of Aristotle's de anima published later at Frankfurt (1605, pp. 333-339). On the textual background of Caspar Peucer's De essentia, natura et ortu animi hominis, see Roebel (2012, p. 258). The book's full title translates to English as, \"Psychology: that is, on the perfection of man, his mind, and especially its origin, the comments and discussions of certain theologians & philosophers of our time who are shown on the turned page.\" Here, the term psychology refers to both a subject of inquiry (\"the perfection of man, his mind, and especially its origin\") and the inquiry itself (\"the comments and discussions of certain theologians & philosophers of our time\"). In the 17th century, Goclenius' Psychologia was read and quoted by scholars like Robert Burton,The anatomy of melancholy (1621).
