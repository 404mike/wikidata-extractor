He is best known for having allegedly cheated William Blake out of the potential profits of his engraving depicting Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims.\nIn the early years of the nineteenth century Cromek had supported Blake, and had engraved Blake's design for Benjamin Heath Malkin's A Father's Memoirs of his Child in 1806. Cromek later commissioned Blake to illustrate Robert Blair's poem The Grave. Blake had produced the designs, but his sample engraving was considered by Cromek to be too crude to attract subscribers. Cromek then gave the lucrative job of engraving Blake's designs to a rival engraver Luigi Schiavonetti.\nIn response, Blake proceeded to create a self-engraved illustration to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Cromek, however, had also given the idea to Blake's friend Thomas Stothard. Stothard's print became far more popular than Blake's, at least during their lifetimes. It remains unclear whether Blake or Cromek originated this project, but Blake certainly believed that the idea was stolen from him. The incident destroyed the friendship between Blake and Stothard.As a savagely humorous comment on these events Blake wrote epigrams attacking Cromek:\n\nCromek loves artists as he loves his meat:\nHe loves the Art; but 'tis the art to cheat.\nA petty sneaking knave I knew--\n\"O! Mr. Cromek, how do ye do?\"\n\nIn 1809 Cromek published Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, a collection of Scottish ballads. The aspirant poet Allan Cunningham sent in poems of his own authorship, which Cromek included in the collection, even though he may have suspected their real authorship.\nAbout that time Cromek also compiled \"RELIQUES OF ROBERT BURNS; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs \". The original edition of 1808 contained a 4-page work by Thomas Stothard, \"The Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury\", which did not appear in some later editions.\nHis son was the artist Thomas Hartley Cromek.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Blake", "response": ["Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate Jerusalem (1804\u201320), his most ambitious work. Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Blake approached the dealer Robert Cromek, with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's haberdashery shop at 27 Broad Street in Soho. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled The Canterbury Pilgrims), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his Descriptive Catalogue (1809), which contains what Anthony Blunt called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.Blunt, Anthony, The Art of William Blake, p 77 It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings.

Bentley suggests that Malkin met Blake in 1803, soon after Blake returned to London from his three years in Felpham.Bentley, 223 It is also possible that the two men were acquainted via the publisher Joseph Johnson for whom Blake had worked.
