Their characters shifted from the middle class to the working class to highlight the tension caused by class conflict within African American families. The independent writers and directors strayed away from the mainstream and won critical approval for remaining faithful to African American history.Kleinhans, p. 61 Another accomplishment of the Black Independent Movement and Burnett was the creation of the Third World Film Club. The club joined with other organizations in a successful campaign to break the American boycott banning all forms of cultural exchange with Cuba.Masilela, p. 110 Many critics have compared the films of the Black Independent Movement to Italian neorealist films of the 1940s, Third World Cinema films of the late 1960s and 1970s, and the 1990s Iranian New Wave. At the time the movement flourished, many countries in the Third World were involved in a struggle for revolution, inspiring them to create films expressing their own indigenous views of their history and culture.

Watt had no knowledge of the service, and claimed the idea was originally instigated by Wright. Wright prepared a rough shooting outline and script by travelling on the railway and used conversations picked up by a stenographer to write the dialogue, all of which was used in the film. Watt then used the rough version to write a full script as the outline had lacked enough detail, \"but there was a shape\". He contacted the LMS and was amazed to find the railway had its own film director who offered assistance. Watt described the research process as \"reasonably straightforward\", which included multiple trips along the railway, and soon completed a full treatment. Wright later said that Watt changed his dialogue towards \"a more human and down-to-earth\" style which he praised him for doing. Early into development, however, Wright had to dedicate more time to other projects and left Watt in charge as director, yet both are credited as the film's two writers, directors, and producers. Initially, Grierson sent his team to observe the postal train staff at work with the aim of producing an information film on the train's operations, but little of the information reported back was used.
