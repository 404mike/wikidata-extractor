Later in 1966, the murder of three policemen in West London also attracted widespread public support for the death penalty's return. Other subsequent high-profile cases to have sparked widespread media and public calls for the death penalty's return include \"Yorkshire Ripper\" Peter Sutcliffe, convicted in 1981 of murdering 13 women and attacking seven others in the north of England; Roy Whiting, who murdered a seven-year-old girl in West Sussex in 2000; and Ian Huntley, a Cambridgeshire school caretaker who killed two 10-year-old girls in 2002."]}, {"page": "Hate mail", "response": ["The parents of Sarah Payne, who was murdered in West Sussex in July 2000, received an anonymous letter while she was still missing, accusing her father and grandfather of having murdered her.

Her mother, Sara Payne, now a child protection campaigner, closed her Twitter social networking account in November 2014 following a long campaign of abuse by trolls, which included allegations that she had made a vast amount of money from her media work and was \"glorying in a lavish lifestyle\" as a result, suggestions that Roy Whiting (convicted of Sarah's murder) was innocent, threatening messages from Twitter users claiming to be paedophiles, and remarks about the death of her former husband Michael from an alcoholism related illness the previous month."]}, {"page": "Murder of Megan Kanka", "response": ["*Roy Whiting, a British man whose crime led to the creation of Sarah's Law, a more limited form of Megan's Law."]}, {"page": "List of prisoners with whole-life orders", "response": ["Some of Britain's most notorious murderers are not among those serving whole-life sentences. These include convicted child killers Roy Whiting and Ian Huntley. Both murderers have been issued 40-year minimum terms by the High Court, which means that they are likely to remain imprisoned for most if not all of their remaining lives, while many other prisoners are in a similar position due to the length of their minimum terms and the age they will be when they can be considered for parole. Nor is Harry Roberts included in the list. Roberts served 48 years prior to his release in 2014, after receiving a minimum sentence of 30 years.

In November 2002, Home Secretary David Blunkett ruled that Whiting should serve at least 50 years in prison, meaning he would only qualify for parole if he lived to the age of 92 or beyond, although this in practice revoked the whole life tariff recommended in court. Whiting appealed against this ruling, his lawyers arguing that Blunkett's ruling had been politically motivated as he was on the verge of losing his powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners, and that the government was under mounting pressure from the British public due to the recent start of a firefighters strike. The crime had also attracted widespread media and public attention, and led to calls for tighter laws regarding the monitoring of convicted sex offenders. Whiting's appeal was heard in June 2010, when the High Court (which by this stage now had the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner should serve before being considered for parole) reduced Whiting's minimum sentence to 40 years, which means he cannot apply for parole until he is at least 82 years of age."]}, {"page": "Murder of Sarah Payne", "response": ["Sarah Evelyn Isobel Payne (13 October 1991 \u2013 c. 1 July 2000), was the victim of a high-profile abduction and murder in West Sussex, England in July 2000.

Whiting was routinely questioned as he was known to local police as a convicted sex offender. Police first visited Whiting's flat on the afternoon of 2 July 2000, but he was not there. The police returned that evening and questioned Whiting for over an hour before leaving.", "The trial of Roy Whiting began on 14 November 2001, at Lewes Crown Court.

The key witnesses included Sarah Payne's oldest brother who had seen a 'scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth' driving through Kingston Gorse on the evening that Sarah Payne went missing. However, Lee Payne did not pick out Whiting when he was selected for an identity parade. One of Payne's shoes was found by a member of the public in a country lane and forensic tests had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. This was the only item of Payne's clothing to be recovered. A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting's van. A DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne. The jury also heard the testimony of two motorists who recalled a white van being parked at the roadside and pulling off a track on the evening of 1 July 2000, near the site where Sarah Payne's body was later found.", "On 24 November 2002, Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered that Roy Whiting must serve a minimum of 50 years in prison. This made him ineligible for parole until 2051, meaning that he would have to live to be at least 92 before parole could be considered; this was in effect an agreement with the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff. Within 48 hours of the ruling being made, the Law Lords and the European Court of Human Rights had ruled in favour of another convicted murderer (Anthony Anderson) who was challenging the right of politicians to decide how long a murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole.", "The campaign for Sarah's Law was spearheaded by the News of the World newspaper, and began in July 2000 in response to Payne's murder.
