He remained with Bury for six seasons making 180 league appearances, scoring twice. He also appeared in all of Bury's matches in the FA Cup in 1902\u201303, reaching the final where they defeated Derby County in one of the most one-sided finals ever played. Bury's 6\u20130 victory still stands as the record Final win. Bury also equalled another record, winning the Cup without conceding a goal in any round.", "In May 1907 he moved, along with Bert Hodgkinson, to the south coast to join Southern League Southampton, where he was once again re-united with Frank Thorpe, who had joined the \"Saints\" from Plymouth Argyle a few weeks earlier. In his first season at The Dell he made 33 Southern League appearances and helped the \"Saints\" to reach the FA Cup Semi Finals where they went out to Wolverhampton Wanderers, beating First Division Everton en route. He remained with Southampton for four seasons during which the team struggled in a vain attempt to regain their former success. Johnston was a \"distinct individual; through all the heat and bustle of the game he was never seen without a blade of grass or some convenient substitute protruding from his mouth.\" He had a strange gait but was a natural leader and tended to coach the forwards while the game was in progress."]}, {"page": "Stalybridge Rovers F.C.", "response": ["Other players included former Blackburn Rovers and Woolwich Arsenal star Tommy Briercliffe, and John Johnston and Frank Thorpe, who both went on to play for Bury, where they won the FA Cup in 1903, and later for Southampton."]}, {"page": "List of Southampton F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Frank Thorpe"]}, {"page": "James Bowden (footballer)", "response": ["At Southampton, he took over at centre-half from Bert Lee who had left during the close season after six years in which he hardly missed a match. Despite his lack of height, Bowden impressed the Saints' fans with his \"stylish neatness when in possession\". Bowden missed two months mid-season following an injury (when he was replaced by John Robertson) before returning at the end of January for the rest of the season.

He made four further appearances in the 1907\u201308 season, including each of the half-back positions and at right-back. In 1908\u201309, he had two runs in the side with six matches at left-half in October (replacing John Johnston with Bert Trueman switching to the right), and twelve matches from mid-January at centre-half whilst Frank Thorpe was out with injury."]}, {"page": "Bert Trueman", "response": ["He was recruited by the \"Saints\" as replacement for the former England international Harry Hadley who had just retired from professional football. Despite being considered too small to be a half-back, Trueman soon proved that his judgement and skill made up for his lack of height and he showed himself to be \"quick, resourceful and decisive in action (who was) overall a most difficult obstacle for opposing forwards\". His debut came on 7 September 1908 in a 4\u20131 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, when Frank Jefferis scored a hat-trick. He soon became established at left-half, alongside Frank Thorpe or Sam Jepp in the centre and John Johnston on the right, although Trueman was able to play in any of the half-back positions. In the 1908\u201309 season, Trueman made 31 league appearances, with Southampton finishing third in the table, having led the table until a run of injuries to key players such as Thorpe and Jefferis in mid-season disrupted the side."]}]}}
