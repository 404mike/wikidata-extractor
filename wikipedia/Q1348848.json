After a tour of Europe Wilkie he was increasingly influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting.

His work on themes of Scottish everyday life included Village Politicians (1806), The Blind Fiddler (1806), Distraining for Rent (1815) and The Penny Wedding (1818). His most famous work was The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch, one of the most popular exhibitions in London in 1822. His sketch Knox preaching before the Lords of the Congregation (1822), dealt with the historic themes that would become a major part of Scottish painting in the second half of the century and he would also be a major influence on oriental painting.

A younger generation that took genre painting into the late nineteenth century included Erskine Nicol and the brothers John and Thomas Faed. Genre art was a major influence on early photography, which developed rapidly in Scotland with figures such as Hill & Adamson.", "A younger generation that took genre painting into the late nineteenth century included Erskine Nicol (1825\u20131904), the brothers John (1818\u20131902), Thomas Faed (1826\u20131900) and James Archer. Thomas Faed established his career with the interior cottage scene of The Mitherless Bairn (1855). The attention to the detail of everyday life and sentimentality of the characters has meant that these painters have been linked with the Kailyard School of Scottish writing, criticised for producing an over-simplified version of Scottish culture and history. His The Last of the Clan (1865), which depicts highlanders left behind by emigration, is one of the few contemporary artistic depictions of the impact of the Highland Clearances. Faed was probably the starting point for the treatment of the Scottish Cottage genre by later artists Hugh Cameron (1835\u20131918), George Paul Chalmers (1833\u201378) and William McTaggart (1835\u20131910).D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 186\u20137. Both Chalmers and Cameron combined an influence from Wilkie with an awareness of contemporary Dutch and French painting, with low tones and subdued colour. For Chalmers this can be seen in works such as the interior scene of The Legend (1864\u201367) and for Cameron in the old lady entering a cottage in A Lonely Life. For McTaggart attempts to balance figures and landscape can be seen his depiction of children on a hillside in Spring (1864).M.
