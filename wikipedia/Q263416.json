The next day, Deakin, Lloyd and Oliver announced that they had \"carried out a review of Miller... and decided his tenure [as chairman] should cease\" at the end of the calendar year. The leader of Stoke-on-Trent City Council, Mohammed Pervez, told reporters that he was \"concerned\" about the club's ability to repay a \u00a32.25 million loan taken out in 2006, and also confirmed that the mortgage the club had taken out in December breached the loan agreement with the council. In addition to board members, The Sentinel's Martin Tideswell also criticised local MP Joan Walley, the local council, the FA, and the Football League for not acting to protect the club from its directors: \"they fiddle and talk in platitudes while Vale Park burns.\" Meanwhile the club's directors announced that the club's AGM would be held on 13 March, having twice postponed the meeting traditionally held in December. On 25 January, fan groups organised an interim board consisting of Pete Williams (supporters' club chairman); Margaret Sinstadt; Mike Thompstone and Paul Humphreys (both of whom former directors who resigned during the 2010\u201311 campaign) \u2013 the former two finding sponsors with at least a \u00a350,000 stake, and the latter two not requiring a stake due to their status as former directors. Six days later, Ameriturf announced that they would again be interested in investing into the club. However the company that produced the club's matchday programmes threatened the club with legal action after they were allegedly misled over sales figures. In February, Stoke-on-Trent city council confirmed that for the first time the club had missed its monthly repayments of around \u00a319,000 for a \u00a32.25 million loan taken out in 2006. On 25 February, the club were hit with a transfer embargo after failing to payca tax bill, leaving fears of administration more acute than ever following the club's exit from administration in 2003. Peter Miller then quit the board, leaving just three directors; meanwhile club sponsors Harlequin Property began suing the club over the repayment of a \u00a3125,000 loan, and the city council confirmed that it was still owed \u00a39,033 in unpaid loan payments. The players were not paid in February. On 29 February, HM Revenue and Customs issued the club with a winding up petition. Two days later the council proposed putting the club into administration, which was by then the club's only chance of survival. Perry Deakin told the media that he regretted ever getting involved with the club, but laid the blame for the club's collapse at the hands of former chairman Bill Bratt; his parting comment was \"Perhaps in hindsight I was a bit naive. I had a look at the club's website and there didn't appear to be any issues there. I guess I should have looked at The Sentinel's site.\""]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Joan Walley (born 1949), Labour MP."]}, {"page": "Walley", "response": ["* Joan Walley, (born 1949), British politician"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs by seniority (2010\u20132015)", "response": ["|059||Joan Walley||style=\"background-color: \"|Lab||Stoke-on-Trent North||rowspan=8|"]}]}}
