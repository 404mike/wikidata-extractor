He retired at Hartlepool, where he began managing. Ashurst also managed Sunderland, won the Welsh Cup with Newport County in 1980, and had two spells at Cardiff City.\nAshurst was inducted into the League Managers Association Hall of Fame in 2014. After his managerial career, he was an administrator at The Football Association and a match delegate for the Premier League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["In October 1977, he replaced Len Ashurst as manager at Sheffield Wednesday, who were then bottom of the Third Division. He appointed as his assistant Maurice Setters, who had experience managing at that level but had effectively ruled himself out of another management job after taking Doncaster Rovers to court for unfair dismissal. The two agreed that while the standard of football in the division was low the work rates were high and so the best way to make progress would be to play long balls into the opposition penalty area whilst recruiting big defenders to avoid being caught out by opposition teams with similar tactics. He took the \"Owls\" to mid-table safety with a 14th-place finish in the 1977\u201378 season, though they did suffer embarrassment by being knocked out of the FA Cup by Northern Premier League side Wigan Athletic."]}, {"page": "Newport County A.F.C.", "response": ["Formed in 1912, the club began life in the Southern League before being invited to become founder members of the Football League Third Division in 1920. They failed re-election in 1931, but were elected back into the Football League the next year. They struggled for the next few seasons, but went on to be crowned Third Division South champions in 1938\u201339. World War II meant they had to wait until the 1946\u201347 season to take their place in the Second Division, though they were relegated at the end of the campaign. They were relegated out of the Third Division in 1962. In the 1979\u201380 season, under manager Len Ashurst, they secured promotion out of the Fourth Division and won the Welsh Cup for the first time. They reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup the next year. In the 1980s they suffered financial difficulties with a double relegation costing them their Football League place in 1988 and the club went out of business in February 1989.", "The 1980s heralded both the brightest and darkest moments in Newport County's history. Len Ashurst was manager from 1978 to 1982, the club's most successful period in its history and under the chairmanship of Richard Ford. In the 1978\u201379 FA Cup County beat West Ham United 2\u20131 in round three before losing 1\u20130 to Colchester United in a fourth round replay. In 1980, promotion was finally achieved from the Football League Fourth Division, the club being only five points from being crowned champions although never being in contention to win the league and never being top. County sealed promotion in the last match of the season with a 4\u20132 win at high-flying Walsall. Walsall finished second in the league and were also promoted."]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Under Len Ashurst (who became manager in 1971), the team slowly began to revive after years of largely indifferent form. The 1971\u201372 season saw a welcome improvement to 18th, and possibly saved the club; Barrow, who had finished bottom the previous year, were voted out in favour of Hereford United despite having improved to 22nd. The club once again avoided the re-election zone in 1972\u201373, finishing in 20th place, but with four successive finishes either in or not far above the bottom four and strong challenges coming from non-league sides, the club needed to show signs of improvement. Ashurst did precisely that, finishing in 11th in 1973\u201374; he then left the club to manage Gillingham."]}, {"page": "Chris Turner (footballer, born 1958)", "response": ["Born in Sheffield, Turner began his goalkeeping career at Sheffield Wednesday, turning professional in August 1976. He enjoyed a highly successful debut season, winning the club's Player of the Year award for his performances across his 52 appearances as Len Ashurst's Owls posted an eighth-place finish in the Third Division in the 1976\u201377 campaign. Wednesday slipped to 14th-place in the 1977\u201378 season, and Turner was limited to 31 appearances as new manager Jack Charlton looked for a larger-sized goalkeeper in Bob Bolder. Wednesday again finished 14th in 1978\u201379, and Turner played 32 games at Hillsborough, whilst also spending a five-game loan spell at bottom club Lincoln City. He was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Brian Hornsby. Despite this award, Charlton sold Turner on to Sunderland for \u00a380,000 in July 1979.", "Ken Knighton led the Rokerites to promotion out of the Second Division in 1979\u201380 \u2013 they finished runners-up, just a point behind champions Leicester City \u2013 with Turner playing 30 of the club's 42 league games as he fended off competition from Barry Siddall. He then featured 31 times as they consolidated their First Division status with a 17th-place finish. New manager Alan Durban then led Sunderland to a 19th-place finish in 1981\u201382, with Turner being limited to only 19 league appearances. He regained his first-team status in the 1982\u201383 season, playing 41 matches as Sunderland posted a 16th-place finish; during the season he managed to keep six clean sheets in a row. Len Ashurst took charge for the end of the 1983\u201384 campaign, and kept faith in Turner, who ended the season with 48 appearances to his name. He featured 53 times across the 1984\u201385 campaign, his last one at Roker Park, as Sunderland were relegated in 21st-place. Sunderland did also make it to the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in 1985, but lost 1\u20130 to Norwich City after Gordon Chisholm deflected Asa Hartford's shot past Turner just after half-time. The campaign did end on a positive note on a personal level for Turner, as supporters voted him the club's Player of the Year."]}, {"page": "Gary Rowell", "response": ["Sunderland manager Len Ashurst forced Rowell out of Roker Park as part of a huge rebuilding plan in 1984, part of the slide which would ultimately take them to the third tier of English football for the first time in the club's history. Rowell moved to Norwich City, but never recreated his goalscoring exploits because of a knee injury he picked up on his first pre season tour with the Canaries. The injury would ultimately blight the rest of his career, although he did go on to play for Middlesbrough, Brighton & Hove Albion and Carlisle United before finishing his career with Burnley."]}, {"page": "Weymouth F.C.", "response": ["*  Len Ashurst (Dec 1992 \u2013 April 1993)"]}, {"page": "Howard Gayle", "response": ["Gayle joined Birmingham City where he played in the 1982\u201383 season scoring once against West Ham and then he hit 10 in 45 during the 1983\u201384 campaign. Gayle then signed for Len Ashurst's Sunderland where he became a popular player playing in two seasons before moving to the United States to play for Dallas Sidekicks in the Major Indoor Soccer League. He returned to England in April 1987 to play for Stoke City playing six matches at the end of the 1986\u201387 season scoring twice in a 3\u20132 defeat against Bradford City."]}, {"page": "Paul Bracewell", "response": ["Sunderland had an unsuccessful 1983\u201384 season and Durban was sacked by the Roker Park club and new manager Len Ashurst did not believe Bracewell could play for him and so sold him to Everton for \u00a3425,000. It was at Goodison Park where Bracewell enjoyed the most successful spell of his career. As part of a midfield that included Peter Reid, Kevin Sheedy and Trevor Steven, they won the 1984\u201385 Football League and also enjoyed success in Europe when they lifted the 1984\u201385 European Cup Winners' Cup. Such form prompted a call-up to the full England squad where he went on to win three caps but missed out on a place in Bobby Robson's 1986 World Cup squad with a broken leg. Bracewell also played in four losing FA Cup Finals, the last of which came following his return to Sunderland in 1992. This is a record for the most FA Cup Final appearances by a player without winning."]}, {"page": "Charlie Hurley", "response": ["In the late sixties, alongside Jimmy Montgomery, Cecil Irwin, Len Ashurst, Martin Harvey and Jim McNab, Hurley formed one of the most notable and most settled back fives in Sunderland's history."]}]}}
