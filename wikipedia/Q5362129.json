The family settled in Paris, at first living with Colonel Henry Shee at Nanterre, later moving to the suburb, Chaillot. Tone educated her children at home. Very few of her letters survive, but much of her husband's letters and diaries where addressed or intended for her. From these and her letter to her friend Eliza Fletcher, it is clear she shared her husband's interest in politics. Following her husband's death in November 1798, she moved to a small apartment at 51 rue St Jacques in the Latin quarter of Paris. This was to be close to her son William, who was attending Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand. She was awarded a pension of 1,200 francs for herself and 400 for each of her children after the rupture of the peace of Amiens on 18 May 1803."]}, {"page": "Charles Salmond", "response": ["*A Woman's Work: Memorials of Eliza Fletcher (1884)"]}]}}
