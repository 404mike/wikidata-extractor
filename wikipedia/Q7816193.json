Hicks studied at St Catherine's College, Oxford and all of his first-class appearances as of the end of 2006 had come for Oxford University teams (Oxford University, Oxford Universities and Oxford UCCE), apart from one game for British Universities in 1999.His two half-centuries have both come for Oxford against Cambridge University: the higher of these being the 58 he scored in 2001, adding 109 for the ninth wicket with opener Matthew Floyd to help set up a three-wicket victory. He also took 5\u201377 in the second innings of this game, second only to the 5-54 he claimed in Oxford's win over Northamptonshire in June 2000.\nHicks has played minor counties cricket for Dorset since 1998, and it was for them that he made his only List A appearance, against Glamorgan in the 2000 NatWest Trophy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Hicks", "response": ["Thomas or Tom Hicks may refer to:", "*Tom Hicks (cricketer) (born 1979), English cricketer", "*Tom Hicks (American football) (born 1952), American football player ", "*Tom Hicks (rugby union) (born 1991), British rugby player", "*Tom Hicks (born 1946), American businessman from Texas"]}, {"page": "Christopher Liptrot", "response": ["Liptrot made his first-class debut early in the 1999 season against Oxford University. Although he took only the wicket of tail-ender Tom Hicks in each innings, he was retained in the Worcestershire side for the County Championship matches which followed. His best performance was later in April, when he took 5-51 on the only day of four in which play was possible in a weather-ruined game against Surrey. After mid-June, however, he dropped out of the first team, although he did play three Youth Tests and three Youth ODIs for England U-19s with fair success against their Australian counterparts."]}]}}
