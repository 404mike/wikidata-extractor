Language used like this restricts itself to an excessively thin power of expression. At the precise point at which the reader might trust a poetic world or style, the poem changes gear.\" Everett continued: \"The most intellectually classy of early Christian heresies was Gnosticism, which denied the real existence of bodies, or their importance (if they existed): Jesus may have been born, but he certainly didn't die. The post-modern feeling for language is similar: words may be written, but can't mean. The result in Ashbery's case is some interesting exercises du style. But real poems are being written in England, in Australia, the Caribbean and the US by at least a dozen English-speaking poets who are committed to a language that lives and dies.\""]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Barbara Everett, academic and literary critic"]}, {"page": "Beatrice (Much Ado About Nothing)", "response": ["Feminist critics argue that Beatrice's wit and female power only serve to enable and maintain male power. In this interpretation, Beatrice's marriage at the end of the play represents her ultimately losing her power in order to become a wife. These critics see Beatrice and Benedick's marriage at the play's conclusion as representing a curing of social abnormality. On the other-hand, critics such as Barbara Everett and John Crick have described Beatrice as a protofeminist. Cedric Watts noted that during the twentieth century, more and more performances favoured a feminist Beatrice with an increased combativeness."]}, {"page": "Emrys Jones (literary scholar)", "response": ["Born in Hoxton, in London's East End, on 30 March 1931 to Welsh parents who ran a corner shop, he was evacuated to Glynneath during the Second World War and attended Neath Grammar School where his classmates included the future medieval historian Peter Lewis, arts administrator Roger Howells and television executive David Nicholas. In 1949, he won the three-year Violet Vaughan Morgan scholarship, enabling him to study at Magdalen College, Oxford, after completing his National Service as a clerk in the Royal Artillery. At Oxford, he studied English under C. S. Lewis, graduating in 1954 with the top first-class degree in his year. After Lewis's promotion in 1955, Jones was appointed his successor as fellow and tutor in English at Magdalen. He was appointed a University Reader in English in 1977 and then given the Goldsmith's Professorship of English Literature (which meant moving to a fellowship at New College, Oxford). He retired in 1998. Jones was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1982. He died on 20 June 2012, leaving a widow and a daughter Hester, a lecturer at the University of Bristol.John Carey, \"Emrys Lloyd Jones, 1931\u20132012\", Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy, vol. 13 (2014), pp. 273\u2013291.\"Professor Emrys Jones\", The Times (London), 24 July 2012, p. 48. .
