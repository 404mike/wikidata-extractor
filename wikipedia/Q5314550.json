Born in Glasgow, Ogilvie began his career with Motherwell in 1932, winning a Scotland cap eighteen months later. In 1936, Ogilvie moved south to join Huddersfield Town but returned to Motherwell before the end of the year in a swap deal for Willie MacFadyen. Like many players, his playing career was interrupted by the Second World War and he concentrated on his engineering work during this time. Indeed, in 1941, he moved to Falkirk to be closer to his home and remained there until December 1946, before spending eighteen months with Hamilton Academical. A final playing season with Dundee United, which saw him playing in defence, ensued before his retirement in 1950. During the 1950s, Ogilvie returned to former club Falkirk as a director.Ogilvie died in May 1967, aged 55.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1938\u201339 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RW |||| Duncan Ogilvie"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Duncan Ogilvie||||MF||18||4||0||0||18||4"]}, {"page": "1935\u201336 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Duncan Ogilvie||||MF||10||0||0||0||10||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Duncan Ogilvie||||1936||28||4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||28||4"]}, {"page": "1942\u201343 Southern League Cup (Scotland)", "response": ["|OR ||||Duncan Ogilvie"]}, {"page": "List of Motherwell F.C. players", "response": ["|style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|Duncan Ogilvie||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|1932\u20131936, 1936\u20131941||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|91||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|35||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|"]}, {"page": "Ogilvie (name)", "response": ["* Duncan Ogilvie (1911\u20131967), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
