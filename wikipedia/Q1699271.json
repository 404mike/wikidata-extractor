Howard suggested that his sister Mary FitzRoy, Duchess of Richmond and Somerset (widow of Henry's illegitimate son Henry Fitzroy) should seduce the aged King, her father-in-law, and become his mistress, to \"wield as much influence on him as Madame d'Etampes doth about the French King\". The Duchess, outraged, said she would \"cut her own throat\" rather than \"consent to such villainy\". She and her brother fell out, and she later laid testimony against Howard that helped lead to his trial and execution for treason. The matter came to a head when Howard quartered the attributed arms of King Edward the Confessor. John Barlow had once called Howard \"the most foolish proud boy that is in England\" and, although the arms of Howard's ancestor Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, show that he was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor's arms, doing so was an act of pride.The Heraldic Charge Against the Earl of Surrey, Peter R. Moore, English Historical Review, Volume CXVI, pages 557 to 583, (2001). In consequence, the King ordered Howard's imprisonment and that of his father, sentencing them to death on 13 January 1547. Howard was beheaded on 19 January 1547 on a charge of treasonably quartering the royal arms. His father escaped execution as the king died the day before that appointed for the beheading, but he remained imprisoned. Howard's son Thomas Howard, became heir to the Dukedom of Norfolk in place of his father, which title he inherited on the 3rd Duke's death in 1554."]}, {"page": "John Barlow", "response": ["John Barlow may refer to:", "*John Barlow (died 1718), MP for Haverfordwest", "*John Barlow (died 1739), MP for Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Sir John Barlow, 1st Baronet (1857\u20131932), British businessman and Member of Parliament", "*Sir John Barlow, 2nd Baronet (1898\u20131986), British Member of Parliament 1951\u20131966", "*John Barlow (Canadian politician) (born 1971), Canadian Member of Parliament from 2014 until present", "*John Barlow (diplomat), English Tudor diplomat and spy", "*John Barlow (priest) (1799\u20131869), Anglican clergyman and scientist", "*John Barlow (entomologist) (1872\u20131944), American entomologist and college administrator", "*John Barlow, New Zealander convicted of murdering businessmen Gene and Eugene Thomas", "*John Barlow (novelist) (born 1967), English novelist", "* John Barlow (veterinary surgeon) (1815\u20131856), British professor in Edinburgh and father of John Henry Barlow", "*John Henry Barlow (1855\u20131924), British Quaker \"ambassador for peace\", son of John Barlow (veterinary scientist)", "*F.
