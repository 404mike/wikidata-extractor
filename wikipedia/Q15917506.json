The next year, 1890, fortunes were reversed when Jacks beat Shackle in the final in three sets. In 1891 and 1892 it was again Shackle who won the title by defeating Jacks in the final, both times in three sets. Shackles's fourth and final title at Beckenham came in 1893 when she won in straight sets against Ruth Legh. Jacks and Shackle also met in the final of the 1891 women's singles events at the British Covered Court Championships. In 1890 Jacks had won the first edition of the women's singles event, played on wood courts at the Queen's Club in London, with the loss of only one game in the final. The following year, 1891, Shackle won the final against Jacks in straight sets. Shackle successfully defended her title in 1892 and 1893 against May Arbuthnot, each time in three sets.Between 1886 and 1895 Shackle participated in five editions of the singles event at the Wimbledon Championships and achieved her best result in 1892 and 1893 when she reached the final of the all-comer's tournament. During both these years only seven women took part in the singles event and both times Shackle lost the all-comers' final in straight sets to Blanche Bingley, who on both occasions would lose the challenge round to Lottie Dod. She did not compete in the doubles or mixed doubles events at Wimbledon.\nIn 1894 Shackle was unable to defend her titles due to a family death.Shackle was a baseline player and her game was based on accuracy and steadiness. She was the first known ambidextrous tennis player. In addition to lawn tennis she also competed in table tennis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hayes, Hillingdon", "response": ["* Tennis player Maud Shackle (1870\u20131962) \u2013 twice a Wimbledon finalist, and the first ambidextrous player - was born in Hayes."]}, {"page": "Queen's Club Championships", "response": ["| 1889 ||  May Jacks ||  Maud Shackle || 6-2 6-1", "| 1890 ||  May Jacks ||  Maud Shackle || 6\u20132, 6\u20131", "| 1891 ||  Maud Shackle ||  May Jacks || 6\u20132, 4\u20136, 6\u20133", "| 1892 ||  Maud Shackle ||  Edith Austin || 6\u20132, 6\u20133", "| 1893 ||  Maud Shackle ||  Edith Austin || 6\u20132, 6\u20131", "| 1895 ||  Maud Shackle ||  Edith Austin || 6\u20132, 7\u20135"]}, {"page": "Shackle (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Maud Shackle, English tennis player"]}, {"page": "British Covered Court Championships", "response": ["|1891 ||  Maud Shackle ||  May Jacks ||7\u20135, 6\u20132 || Wood", "|1892 ||  Maud Shackle ||  May Arbuthnot ||6\u20133, 3\u20136, 6\u20132 || Wood", "|1893 ||  Maud Shackle ||  May Arbuthnot ||6\u20132, 1\u20136, 7\u20135 || Wood"]}, {"page": "1892 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's singles", "response": ["Blanche Hillyard defeated Maud Shackle 6\u20131, 6\u20134 in the All Comers' Final, but the reigning champion Lottie Dod defeated Bingley Hillyard 6-1, 6-1 in the Challenge Round to win the Ladies' Singles tennis title at the 1892 Wimbledon Championships.100 Years of Wimbledon by Lance Tingay, Guinness Superlatives Ltd. 1977"]}, {"page": "1893 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's singles", "response": ["Blanche Hillyard defeated Maud Shackle 6\u20133, 6\u20132 in the All Comers' Final, but the reigning champion Lottie Dod defeated Hillyard 6\u20138, 6\u20131, 6\u20134 in the Challenge Round to win the Ladies' Singles tennis title at the 1893 Wimbledon Championships.100 Years of Wimbledon by Lance Tingay, Guinness Superlatives Ltd. 1977"]}, {"page": "Kent Championships", "response": ["|1889 ||  Maud Shackle  ||  May Jacks || 6\u20133, 7\u20135", "|1890 ||  May Jacks  ||  Maud Shackle || 4\u20136, 6\u20130, 6\u20134", "|1891 ||  Maud Shackle  ||  May Jacks || 6\u20134, 6\u20130", "|1892 ||  Maud Shackle  ||  May Jacks || 6\u20133, 6\u20131", "|1893 ||  Maud Shackle  ||  Ruth Legh || 6\u20133, 6\u20134"]}, {"page": "May Jacks", "response": ["In the same year, Jacks won the inaugural Queen's Club Championship, beating Maud Shackle 6\u20132, 6\u20131.
