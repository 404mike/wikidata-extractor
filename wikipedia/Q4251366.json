With Tom Adeyemi unavailable and Callum Reilly unfit to start, both because of illness, Lee made his first appearance in the Championship at Leeds United on 20 October and played the full 90 minutes as Birmingham lost 4\u20130.

In the following game, a 4\u20130 win against Millwall, manager Lee Clark described the performance of Reilly and Adeyemi in partnership in defensive midfield as brilliant. They played regularly together until January, when new arrivals, including Manchester City's Emyr Huws and the experienced Brian Howard, caused Reilly to fall out of favour. By the end of March, with Birmingham struggling, Reilly returned to the team, playing either in midfield or at left back. On the last day of the season, needing at least a draw at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to go in their favour to avoid relegation to League One, he started at left back, later moving into central midfield to replace the injured Huws, as the team came back from 2\u20130 down to equalise in the third minute of stoppage time and maintain their second-tier status."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["After a three-week period without first-team football, Stevenage returned to action with a home game against Leyton Orient on 2 February. The game ended 1\u20130 to the visitors, with an early Dean Cox goal separating the two teams. New signing Ben Chorley made his debut during the match, having signed from Orient just two days earlier. Three days later, on 5 February, Stevenage secured their first home win since October, beating Notts County 2\u20130 at Broadhall Way. Loanee Sam Hoskins gave Stevenage the lead inside the first minute, finishing calmly after Filipe Morais' shot had deflected into his path. Substitute Marcus Haber headed in a Morais cross in the final minute to give Stevenage a two-goal cushion. The team then made the long journey north to face Carlisle United on 9 February, losing the match 2\u20131. Carlisle were two goals to the good within the first fourteen minutes. Striker Rory Loy gave the hosts the lead, before Lee Miller doubled their advantage from the penalty spot, with goalkeeper Steve Arnold receiving a red card for a foul on Loy that resulted in the penalty. Marcus Haber scored his second goal in as many games to reduce the deficit, but Carlisle held on for the win. Stevenage then faced their second away game in three days, travelling to Griffin Park to face promoting-chasing Brentford. The hosts secured a comfortable 2\u20130 victory, thanks to long-range strikes from Tom Adeyemi and Marcello Trotta. A third straight defeat followed a week later, with Stevenage losing 2\u20131 at home to Oldham Athletic. The home side had taken a one-goal lead into the interval, courtesy of James Dunne's neat finish from the edge of the area. However, Oldham fought back with second-half goals from Dean Furman and James Tarkowski, taking all three points and inflicting Stevenage's eighth defeat in ten matches. Another defeat followed four days later, on 23 February, this time a 2\u20131 loss to Shrewsbury Town at New Meadow. Similarly to their previous match against Oldham, James Dunne gave Stevenage the lead in the first-half. Shrewsbury equalised on the half hour mark, before scoring late-on to secure all three points. Stevenage then lost 1\u20130 to Scunthorpe United three days later, with a second-half Mark Duffy strike settling the match. The result was Stevenage's tenth defeat in twelve matches, leaving them just eight points above the relegation places."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Norwich City F.C. season", "response": ["| Tom Adeyemi", "|  Tom Adeyemi (MF)", "| \u2013 || CM || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Tom Adeyemi || U21"]}]}}
