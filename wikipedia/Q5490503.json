In 1884 he had success in a Shakespeare role in Henry Irving's company, and in 1885 he created the role of Ravennes in the comic opera Erminie, which went on to become an international sensation. In this production he met Violet Melnotte, who also appeared in Erminie and who managed the theatre where it premiered; they married in 1886.\nIn his more than two-decade career on stage Wyatt is best remembered for his roles with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1889 to 1891, and in particular for creating the role of the Duke of Plaza-Toro in Gilbert and Sullivan's hit comic opera The Gondoliers. Wyatt continued to perform in comic operas and comedies until about 1900.  From the 1890s Wyatt and his wife owned and managed the Trafalgar Square Theatre, known after 1895 as the Duke of York's Theatre.  He also wrote plays and a grand opera.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wyatt (surname)", "response": ["*Frank Wyatt (1852\u20131926), English actor", "*Frank Wyatt (sport shooter) (born 1946), British sport shooter"]}, {"page": "Opera Comique", "response": ["Once D'Oyly Carte left the Opera Comique the theatre's fortunes declined.

Lingard and Luscombe Searelle, described by The Era as \"curious and impudent\", which ran until October. During the rest of the 1880s a succession of managements presented a wide range of genres, from adaptations of French plays, Shakespeare, Sheridan, Ibsen, and a Dickens adaptation by the novelist's son, to musical shows, including The Fay o' Fire by Edward Jones and Henry Herman, which The Era later described as \"notable as introducing Miss Marie Tempest to the regular stage\".
