This announcement also means that Scarborough and Exeter City, who had been battling to avoid bottom spot (with Northampton Town also having been not entirely out of danger), are guaranteed safety regardless of where they finish. In the Autoglass Trophy final, a Wembley match is decided by a golden goal for the first time when a 103rd-minute goal from Paul Tait gives Birmingham City a 1\u20130 win over Carlisle United.
