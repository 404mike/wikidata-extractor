Norman Snaith remarked that it was a tragedy \u2018that he died before his own thinking reached a constructive stage.\u2019 For S. G. F. Brandon, \u2018(p)erhaps the fairest estimate of this book is to regard it as prolegomena to a great study of taboo which will, unhappily, not now be written by Franz Steiner\u2019. Assessments of his style however vary. For Fred Cottrell, it was \u2018very lucid and witty\u2019. For Katherine Luomela, the book was  \u2018highly organized, closely reasoned, and tightly written\u2019, though his \u2018sentences are really so jammed with content as to make for rather slow and heavy going (reading) and often raise doubt as to one\u2019s comprehension of his meaning\u2019. S.G. F. Brandon, noting Evans-Pritchard\u2019s remark on the way Steiner\u2019s omnivorous erudition and fanatical search for comprehensiveness slowed the publication of his research, thought it \u2018not an easy book to read, partly owing to that obscurity of expression which so often marks the writing of a scholar in a language of which he has an apparent command but which is not his native tongue.\u2019 But it was precisely the compactness of his thought which endowed the work with peculiar value, for \u2018in its analysis it is most thorough and no tacit assumption nor loose logic in argument is allowed to pass unexamined\u2019. Joseph Politella, to the contrary, regarded the work as a \u2018brilliant exposition, along historical and sociological lines, of the custom of taboo\u2019. In Norman Snaith\u2019s judgement, a proper appreciation of the book could not ignore the tragedy of Steiner\u2019s personal life, as a victim of Nazi tyranny. In this sense, his criticisms of both Robertson Smith and Frazer as thinkers whose ideas were thoroughly embedded in the values of the period they themselves lived and worked in may be applied as a criterion, mutatis mutandis, to Steiner\u2019s own work. \u2018A naturally acute and critical mind has been sharpened to a razor-edge by his privations. This is why his criticisms are so severe, and occasionally super-punctilious. Cora DuBois characterized Steiner\u2019s  \u2018critical reasoning\u2019 as \u2018subtle and involuted, at times to the point of obscurity, and the critical mood is predominantly captious\u2019, but affirmed that, \u2018(n)evertheless, these lectures are of a high intellectual order and occasionally possess passages of literary merit\u2019.", "*S.G.F. Brandon argues that, curiously for someone with a background in Semitic philology, Steiner omitted analysing the \u2018striking examples of taboo-peril in I Samuel VI.19, and Books of 11 Samuel VI, 6-7. However, Norman Snaith considered that his studies constituted \u2018a definite help in the study of the holiness-taboo-uncleanness complex of Leviticus.\u2019"]}, {"page": "List of honorary graduates of the University of Leeds", "response": ["* Rev.
