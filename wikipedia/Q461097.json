The Polanski house was often full of strangers, and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the \"free spirit\" of the times, saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was \"live and let live\". Her close friend Leslie Caron commented that the Polanskis were too trusting, \"to the point of recklessness\", and that she had been alarmed by it.", "On August 8, 1969, Tate entertained actress Joanna Pettet and Barbara Lewis for lunch at her home, confiding in them her disappointment at Polanski's delay in returning from London.
