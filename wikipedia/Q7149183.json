With the partnership of Paul Baker and Joe Allon working well in attack, the team were in the top 10 for much of the season and in with a good chance of reaching a play-off place. Then, tragedy struck in February 1991 when Knowles was diagnosed with brain cancer and Alan Murray took over on a temporary basis. Under Murray, the team's form improved further and the club went into the final day of the season as one of several clubs that could win not just promotion but the title.

New boss Cyril Knowles was the catalyst for change as he turned the club's fortunes around. Allon enjoyed a reunion with his former Newcastle United teammate Gascoigne in September 1990 as Pools played Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup.
