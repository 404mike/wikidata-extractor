Following the Easter Rising in 1916, Sinn F\u00e9in had grown in popularity, eclipsing the Irish Parliamentary Party.  Sinn F\u00e9in candidates treated the election as an Irish general election, pledging not to take their seats in the British House of Commons, but to unilaterally establish a separate parliament in Dublin.\nAt the election, the Dublin University constituency returned two Unionists, and Dockrell was the only other Irish Unionist returned outside Ulster.  Rather than joining Sinn F\u00e9in in the First D\u00e1il, Dockrell took his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\nHis wife, Margaret Dockrell was a suffragist, philanthropist, and councillor. His son Henry Morgan Dockrell was later a Fine Gael Teachta D\u00e1la (TD), and his grandsons Percy and Maurice Dockrell were also long-serving Fine Gael TDs.\nMaurice ran the Dockrell family business of builders' providers in Dublin.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
