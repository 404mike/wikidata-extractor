Following the Easter Rising in 1916, Sinn F\u00e9in had grown in popularity, eclipsing the Irish Parliamentary Party.  Sinn F\u00e9in candidates treated the election as an Irish general election, pledging not to take their seats in the British House of Commons, but to unilaterally establish a separate parliament in Dublin.\nAt the election, the Dublin University constituency returned two Unionists, and Dockrell was the only other Irish Unionist returned outside Ulster.  Rather than joining Sinn F\u00e9in in the First D\u00e1il, Dockrell took his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\nHis wife, Margaret Dockrell was a suffragist, philanthropist, and councillor. His son Henry Morgan Dockrell was later a Fine Gael Teachta D\u00e1la (TD), and his grandsons Percy and Maurice Dockrell were also long-serving Fine Gael TDs.\nMaurice ran the Dockrell family business of builders' providers in Dublin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Government of Ireland Act 1920", "response": ["After considerable delays in debating the financial aspects of the measure, the substantive third reading of the Bill was approved by a large majority on 11 November 1920.

Many of the IUA's leading figures were associated with the Kildare Street Club, a gentleman's club in Dublin. The electoral support base of the IUA in southern Ireland was largely drawn from its Protestant population, many of whom were farmers, small business owners or Church of Ireland clergymen. In 1913, the IUA had a southern core of 683 members, with approximately 300,000 supporters spread across the three southern provinces.Alan O'Day, Reactions to Irish Nationalism, 1865\u20131914 (Bloomsbury Publishing, 1 July 1987), 370\u2013371.UCC article with numbers in 1921 and 1926  In March 1919 Sir Maurice Dockrell told the House of Commons that the supporting population was \"about 350,000\".Debate on the Local Government (Ireland) Bill, 24 March 1919 The IUA never achieved \"mass party\" status in the south.

The UAPL attracted numerous leading figures from the southern unionist community, including Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore, Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh, John Arnott, Sir Maurice Dockrell and Valentine Browne, 5th Earl of Kenmare.

However, the majority of ordinary southern unionists remained with the IUA, which was left without effective leadership outside Northern Ireland following the split. The UAPL developed into a think-tank, with a focus on minority rights and constitutional affairs. The group argued against Sinn F\u00e9in's policy of absenteeism from the British parliament, believing that it left Irish domestic interests without proper representation. The UAPL was supportive of the work of the Proportional Representation Society of Ireland, seeing proportional representation as a way of ensuring unionist voices were heard in government. In June 1919 the leadership of the League was approached by Sir Horace Plunkett, who invited them to join the new Irish Dominion League. The idea was rejected, as the Dominion League was perceived to be too sympathetic to Irish nationalism.Wells, Warre B, Irish Indiscretions (London: Allen & Unwin, 1922), 90. The establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 and the consequent decrease in the number of southern unionists resulted in the disestablishment of the League."]}, {"page": "Maurice Dockrell (1850\u20131929)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Maurice Dockrell (Unionist politician)"]}]}}
