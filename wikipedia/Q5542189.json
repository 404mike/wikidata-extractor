In 1844 Sharpe remodelled the hall for George Marton, retaining its rectangular core. He more than doubled the size of the house by adding a west wing containing dining and drawing rooms, a top-lit staircase, a tower, and Gothic style windows. The tower also acted as a water tower for the house. Later, in 1848, after Sharpe had been joined as a partner by E. G. Paley, a stable and a service block were added to the east of the house.  In 1875\u201376 a southeast block including a billiard room and a clock tower was added by the successors in the practice, Paley and Austin."]}, {"page": "Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| George Marton", "| George Marton || Conservative"]}, {"page": "High Sheriff of Lancashire", "response": ["*1858 George Marton, of Capernwray Hall"]}, {"page": "George Marton (1839\u20131905)", "response": ["Marton was the son of George Marton (1801\u20131867) of Capernwray Hall, Lancashire, and his wife Lucy Sarah Dallas daughter of Sir Robert Dallas, Chief Justice of Common Pleas.

Having been disused for a time, the Evangelical Fellowship were given the use of the chapel by Mrs Thomas."]}]}}
