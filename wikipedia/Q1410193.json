Alex Watson, recently signed on loan from Pulis' former club Bournemouth, scored the only goal of that game.  Pulis was named the divisional Manager of the Month for September, the first time that a Gillingham manager had achieved this feat for ten years.  Gillingham achieved their biggest win of the season on 21 October, defeating Doncaster Rovers 4\u20130.  After this result, Gillingham were three points clear of second-placed Preston North End and had conceded only five goals in thirteen matches, fewer than half the number allowed by any other team in the division.  The team only scored a single goal across the next three games, however, achieving a 1\u20131 draw and two 0\u20130 draws, after which they had slipped to third in the table."]}]}}
