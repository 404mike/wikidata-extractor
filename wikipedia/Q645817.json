Eight golfers contested the event, with Willie Park, Sr. winning the championship by 2 shots from Old Tom Morris, and he was declared \"The Champion Golfer of the Year\".", "A year later, it became \"open\" to amateurs as well as professionals. Ten professionals and eight amateurs contested the event, with Old Tom Morris winning the championship by 4 shots from Willie Park, Sr. A prize fund (\u00a310) was introduced in 1863 split between 2nd, 3rd and 4th (the winner only received the Challenge Belt). From 1864 onwards a cash prize was also paid to the winner. Before this the only financial incentive was scheduling Prestwick's own domestic tournament the same week, this allowed professionals to earn a few days' work caddying for the wealthier gentlemen. Willie Park, Sr. went on to win two more tournaments, and Old Tom Morris three more, before Young Tom Morris won three consecutive titles between 1868 and 1870. The rules stated that he was allowed to keep the belt for achieving this feat. Because no trophy was available, the tournament was not held in 1871."]}, {"page": "Old Tom Morris", "response": ["| align=center|1861 ||The Open Championship ||2 shot deficit || 54-56-53=163 ||4 strokes|| Willie Park, Sr.", "| align=center|1862 ||The Open Championship  (2) ||11 shot lead || 52-55-56=163 ||13 strokes || Willie Park, Sr.", "| align=center|1867 ||The Open Championship  (4) ||2 shot lead || 58-54-58=170 ||2 strokes|| Willie Park, Sr."]}]}}
