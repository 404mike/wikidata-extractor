In a special issue of the Socialist Register commemorating the Manifestos 150th anniversary, Peter Osborne argued that it was \"the single most influential text written in the nineteenth century\".Osborne, Peter. 1998. \"Remember the Future?

Academic John Raines in 2002 noted: \"In our day this Capitalist Revolution has reached the farthest corners of the earth. The tool of money has produced the miracle of the new global market and the ubiquitous shopping mall. Read The Communist Manifesto, written more than one hundred and fifty years ago, and you will discover that Marx foresaw it all\".Raines, John (2002). \"Introduction\". Marx on Religion (Marx, Karl). Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p. 5. In 2003, English Marxist Chris Harman stated: \"There is still a compulsive quality to its prose as it provides insight after insight into the society in which we live, where it comes from and where it's going to. It is still able to explain, as mainstream economists and sociologists cannot, today's world of recurrent wars and repeated economic crisis, of hunger for hundreds of millions on the one hand and 'overproduction' on the other. There are passages that could have come from the most recent writings on globalisation\".Harman, Chris (2010). \"The Manifesto and the World of 1848\".
