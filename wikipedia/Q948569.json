Following the failure of the senior line of the Butler family, he was the second representative of the Kilcash branch to inherit the earldom.\nHis friend, the 1st Earl of Strafford, caused him to be appointed the commander of the Cavalier forces in Ireland. From 1641 to 1647, he led the Royal Irish Army fighting against the Irish Catholic Confederation. From 1649 to 1650 he was the leading commander of the Royalist forces in the fight against the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.\nIn the 1650s he lived in exile on the continent with King Charles II of England. Upon the restoration of Charles to the throne in 1660, Ormond became a major figure in English and Irish politics, holding many high government offices such as Chancellor of the University of Oxford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1688", "response": ["* July 21 \u2013 James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, Irish statesman (b. 1610)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Blood", "response": ["As part of the expression of discontent, Blood conspired to storm Dublin Castle, usurp the government, and kidnap James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, for ransom.
