He made his debut for Kent's Second XI in 1936 before making his first-class cricket debut in 1938 against Surrey at Rectory Field, Blackheath. He played for Kent until 1954, making a total of 249 appearances for the Kent First XI either side of the war. Dovey was awarded his county cap in 1946 and was used as a \"stock bowler\" by Kent. He has been described as a \"more than useful off-spinner\" who was \"reliable\".As well as spinning the ball he could also bowl effective medium-pace deliveries and turned the ball sharply, especially on damp pitches. Dovey took career best bowling figures of eight wickets for 23 runs on such a pitch in 1950 against Surrey, taking 102 wickets for Kent during the season.Dovey toured India and Ceylon with a Commonwealth cricket team in 1950\u201351, playing in 10 first-class matches on the tour, and took a total of 777 first-class wickets in his career. He played non-first-class matches for Glamorgan sides during the war and made his final first class appearance for Kent against the touring Pakistanis in August 1954.After retiring from first-class cricket Dovey coached cricket at Sherborne School in Dorset, playing Minor Counties Championship cricket for Dorset County Cricket Club from 1955 to 1959. He made 57 Championship appearances for the county side before returning to Kent to work at Tonbridge School where he was involved with developing young cricketers including Christopher Cowdrey. Dovey died suddenly at Tunbridge Wells in Kent in December 1974 aged 54.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Ray Dovey"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Kent improved from seventh to fourth and were able to announce increased attendances and membership. The team was again captained by Bryan Valentine and featured England stars Godfrey Evans and Doug Wright, though they missed several championship matches for Test calls. Kent were particularly well served by their batsmen, although Valentine had problems with loss of form at times. Les Ames, Les Todd and Arthur Fagg all scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. The young left-hander Peter Hearn was regarded as a fine prospect and was awarded his county cap. Wright was the main bowler and was supported by off spinner Ray Dovey, all-rounder Jack Davies and the two pacemen Fred Ridgway and Norman Harding. Harding died unexpectedly in September, aged 31.Wisden 1948 \u2013 obituary, p. 783. Other players included Geoffrey Anson, Brian Edrich, the veteran Hopper Levett in his final season, Tony Mallett, future captain Bill Murray-Wood and Tony Pawson.

The team was judged to be stronger than the England team which was concurrently (and disastrously) touring Australia.

From 1950 to 1956, Betts made 31 appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against Wiltshire. In 1951, he made his only appearance in first-class cricket for a combined Minor Counties team against Kent at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury. Batting first, Kent made 365/8 declared, with Betts taking five wickets in the innings, finishing with figures of 5/95. In response, the Minor Counties made 169 all out in their first-innings, with Betts, who batted at number eleven, being dismissed for a duck by Simon Kimmins. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, the Minor Counties fared little better, making 186, with Betts the last man out when he was dismissed for a single run by Ray Dovey. Kent won the match by an innings and 10 runs."]}]}}
