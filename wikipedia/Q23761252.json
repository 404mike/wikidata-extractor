Samantha Hunt joined them on fiddle.

Beggarman, which is played fast, is a standard in their live set list and features a didgeridoo very prominently.  Black is the Colour, sung by guitarist Steve Twigger, is very slow and mournful, reminiscent of the original composition from the previous album She Was the Prize. An Poc Ar Buile is the band's first venture in the Irish language.  The song is normally slowly sung, but Gaelic Storm puts a twist into it by singing it fast, complete with hoots and hollers.  Go Home, Girl is a faster tune about a girl who falls in love with a gypsy, only to have her advances turned down for an ironic reason.", "Before the Night is Over is an original love song.  Johnny Tarr is a mainstay for the live set, complete with the nonsensical noise to start it off.  It tells the tale of a heavy drinker who drank enough to kill a normal human, but he died of thirst instead. Swimmin' in the Sea is a nostalgic song about childhood at the sea and sung by the guitarist Steve Twigger.  I Thought I Knew You, also sung by the guitarist, has fast lyrics with an unusual rhyme scheme about a relationship gone bad.  Related to that is the last tune, original but sung by the fiddler, a slow and lamenting song about lonely life on the road.  Mary's Eyes is a remake of a Janis Ian song, also sung by the fiddler, and is a mournful song about the homeland in the form of a girl."]}, {"page": "Special Reserve (Gaelic Storm album)", "response": ["* Steve Twigger (Guitar, Bouzouki, Mandolin, Lead Vocals)"]}, {"page": "Bring Yer Wellies", "response": ["* Steve Twigger (guitar, bouzouki, mandolin, lead vocals)"]}, {"page": "What's the Rumpus?", "response": ["* Steve Twigger (guitar, vocals, bodhran)"]}, {"page": "Cabbage (Gaelic Storm album)", "response": ["# \"Raised on Black and Tans\" (Steve Twigger, Steve Wehmeyer, Patrick Murphy) \u2013 3:29", "* Steve Twigger \u2013 guitar, bouzouki, mandolin, bodhr\u00e1n, lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Chicken Boxer", "response": ["* Steve Twigger \u2013 guitar, bouzouki, mandolin, bodhr\u00e1n, lead vocals"]}, {"page": "The Boathouse (Gaelic Storm album)", "response": ["# \"Watery Grave\" (Steve Twigger) - 4:15"]}, {"page": "Matching Sweaters", "response": ["# \"Another Stupid Drinking Song\" (Steve Twigger, Steve Wehmeyer, Patrick Murphy) \u2013 3:22", "* Steve Twigger"]}, {"page": "Patrick Murphy (musician)", "response": ["After his studies in University College Cork, Murphy moved to the United States.
