Not to be deterred Starling was prominent in Wednesday re-taking the lead on 70 minutes when his pass released Mark Hooper who beat two men before hitting a shot past Harold Pearson that went in off a post. Within five minutes West Brom were level as a Teddy Sandford shot was deflected into the net off Walt Millership. At this stage West Brom looked the likely winners with some of the Wednesday players arguing amongst themselves as they kicked off. It was during this stage of the game that the limping Joe Carter missed his two good chances, hitting the post with one of them. W. G. Richardson also missed a fine opportunity. With only five minutes remaining and extra time looking a distinct possibility Ellis Rimmer, who had had a quiet match up till that point made his mark on the match. He chased a long through ball from Wilf Sharp and the tall winger got his head to the ball just before West Brom keeper Pearson could reach it and guided it into the net. In the final minute Rimmer scored his second goal when Pearson could only parry a Mark Hooper shot and Rimmer knocked the ball home from close range. Wednesday had won the cup and Ellis Rimmer had scored in every round.\"Sheffield Football, A History\", Keith Farnsworth,  Page 200 (Gives details of match).\"Wednesday\", Keith Farnsworth, pages 132\u2013135 (Gives details of match and team selections).", "| ||4 || Wilf Sharp"]}, {"page": "Sharp (surname)", "response": ["* Wilf Sharp (1907\u20131981), English footballer with Airdrieonians and Sheffield Wednesday"]}]}}
