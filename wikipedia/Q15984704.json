He is known for his early work on the calculation of logarithms.\nSpeidell was a mathematics teacher in London and one of the early followers of the work John Napier had previously done on natural logarithms. In 1619 Speidell published a table entitled \"New Logarithmes\" in which he calculated the natural logarithms of sines, tangents, and secants.He then diverged from Napier's methods in order to ensure all of the logarithms were positive. A new edition of \"New Logarithmes\" was published in 1622 and contained an appendix with the natural logarithms of all numbers 1-1000.Along with William Oughtred and Richard Norwood, Speidell helped push toward the abbreviations of trigonometric functions.Speidel published a number of work about mathematics, including An Arithmeticall Extraction in 1628. His son, Euclid Speidell, also published mathematics texts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Natural logarithm", "response": ["An early mention of the natural logarithm was by Nicholas Mercator in his work Logarithmotechnia, published in 1668, although the mathematics teacher John Speidell had already compiled a table of what in fact were effectively natural logarithms in 1619. It has been said that Speidell's logarithms were to the base , but this is not entirely true due to complications with the values being expressed as integers."]}, {"page": "Euclid Speidell", "response": ["Euclid Speidell (died 1702) was an English customs official and mathematics teacher known for his writing on logarithms.
