On his fourth appearance of the season, Carmedy netted a hat-trick in the 4\u20130 home win over Wrexham. He enjoyed a sustained run at centre forward between December 1929 and February 1930, during which time he scored a further four goals. Towards the end of the season, he shared centre forward duties with new arrival Ernie Dixon, who had arrived from Huddersfield Town for a fee of \u00a3300. Carmedy ended the campaign with 10 goals in 29 league matches as the team finished 19th in the league."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|Fred Ferrari"]}]}}
