The signing of fellow Welsh international John Charles had raised hopes of improvement but the side struggled throughout the season, winning just 14 league matches out of 42. Allchurch finished as the club's top league scorer, scoring 12 times including a hat-trick against Sunderland in September 1963. The club's struggles saw George Swindin dismissed as manager and replaced by Jimmy Scoular, who had captained Newcastle during Allchurch's spell in the North-East. Allchurch found Scoular's loud and vocal form of management difficult and in mid-October 1964, found himself dropped from the side after recovering from a brief thigh injury as Scoular favoured playing Peter King in his place. He did not return to the first team until February, during which time he stated his desire to leave the club, when Scoular was forced to recall him after the Bluebirds had suffered a severe decline during his absence. Scoular had introduced a new youth policy within the squad, handing regular places to players such as King, George Johnston and Don Murray. Murray later commented that he regarded it as a privilege to play alongside Allchurch and Charles and stated \"There was a saying among the players, if you are in trouble give it to Ivor\"."]}, {"page": "Duffus", "response": ["* Don Murray former professional footballer who was born and grew up in Duffus before playing for Cardiff City, Swansea City, Heart of Midlothian and Newport County."]}, {"page": "List of Cardiff City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["Defender Don Murray holds the record for the longest unbroken spell of appearances for the club, playing in 146 consecutive matches between May 1968 and November 1971."]}, {"page": "Richie Morgan", "response": ["Born in Cardiff, Morgan was playing for Cardiff Corinthians before signing for Cardiff City in 1966.
