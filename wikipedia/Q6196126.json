Well-regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal to write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Back in England after the 1953\u201354 tour, Trueman in 1954 was able to play a full season for the first time since 1951. Jim Kilburn wrote that, at the age of 23, Trueman \"had acquired a man's physique for fast bowling that questioned the courage as well as the technique of opposing batsmen\".Kilburn, p. 141. He played in 33 matches and, for the first time, exceeded 100 wickets in a season. His tally was 134 at 15.55 with a best return of eight for 28. Yorkshire probably should have won the County Championship in 1954 having won six of their first seven matches but were badly hit by wet weather in August and finished runners-up behind Surrey.Webber, p. 88. Trueman and the medium-paced Appleyard formed an effective combination, backed up by Wardle's spin, and Yorkshire had a strong bowling side. The rest of the team mostly comprised Hutton, Lowson, Yardley, Lester, Watson, Vic Wilson, Close, Illingworth and wicket-keeper Roy Booth.", "In Jim Kilburn's view, \"(Trueman's) place among the truly great bowlers of cricket history is beyond question\". He had a \"resilience of spirit (that was) as marked as the physical power that gave him such remarkable freedom from injury over the years\".Kilburn, p. 189 His name on the team-sheet was \"an advertisement for any match\".Kilburn, p. 171 Trueman's method was a long, accelerating run-up ending in a wide delivery stride with a \"cartwheel\" swing of the arms and a balanced follow-through. Technically, he was \"highly accomplished\" as he had much more than mere speed at his command, for he learned in-swing, out-swing and variation of pace and length. Kilburn's final analysis of Trueman's contribution to Yorkshire cricket is: \"In an XI representing all the county history he would be selected\"."]}, {"page": "Norman Yardley", "response": ["Judgements were mixed on Yardley's performance as Yorkshire's captain. His record would have been considered good at any other county, but not by the standards set by previous Yorkshire sides. Critics felt that Yorkshire should have won the Championship with the players available. Contemporaries believed him to be the best captain in the country tactically, taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness. Trevor Bailey, who played against him for Essex and under him for England, wrote that he thought him \"an outstanding tactician and an expert on wicket behaviour. He was unquestionably one of the best captains I have ever played with or against. It has been said that he was too nice to lead Yorkshire, but I cannot think of anybody I have preferred playing under.\"Bailey, p. 141. Alan Gibson believed that unlike some county captains, Yardley was worth his place in the side on cricketing ability. However, he seemed unable to extract the best from his players. Jim Kilburn noted that he used orthodox tactics, even when a different approach was called for, while other critics believed that he was shocked by the attitude of some difficult players in the side. Neither Yardley nor Hutton, his senior professional, were disciplinarians in the dressing room and kept apart from others. Both were frequently absent, playing in representative matches. This may have inflamed the situation, leading to accusations that some players were out of control. Yardley disliked confrontation, and Ray Illingworth, who played under him, described him as too nice to stand up to his players. But Bob Appleyard, another of his former players, gives Yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a spinner, and believes that he and Hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians.Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 33, 127. Generally, he was popular with his players."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe", "response": ["In all first-class cricket in the 1931 season, Sutcliffe scored four centuries in consecutive innings and averaged 96.96, topping the first-class averages for the first time. He totalled 3,006 runs with a highest score of 230 among 13 centuries.  Yorkshire historian Jim Kilburn commented on Sutcliffe's general consistency as \"almost past believing\" while Sutcliffe himself reckoned that his accomplishments in 1931, which was a wet summer, were the best of his entire career.Hill, p.117."]}, {"page": "George Hirst", "response": ["Hirst completed the double 14 times, more than any other cricketer except Rhodes. Unusually for an all-rounder, for much of his career he was equally successful as a batsman and as a bowler. Consequently, he was a key member of the Yorkshire team. His Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke described Hirst as \"the greatest county cricketer of all time\", and journalist Jim Kilburn noted that no cricketer could \"capture the heart and the imagination and the affections more firmly than George Herbert Hirst\". E. W. Swanton described his typical style of play as \"grafting for victory without heroics\".Swanton, p. 12. His record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than his figures in county cricket, owing to some extent to playing conditions during his two tours of Australia which reduced the effectiveness of his bowling and batting."]}, {"page": "Abe Waddington", "response": ["Waddington resented the class divisions in English cricket, his feelings fuelled by experiences of officers in the war and possibly his tour to Australia in 1920\u201321. He fully embraced Yorkshire's hard-edged competitiveness in the early 1920s: he questioned the decisions of umpires and sledged opposing batsmen, both of which were unusual at the time. His Times obituary noted that some disagreements came because Waddington played to win and was an enthusiastic appealer, although he was unlikely to win many appeals for leg before wicket because of the angle at which he bowled. Anthony Woodhouse, the cricket historian, describes Waddington as a \"wild and irresponsible\u00a0...\u00a0quick-tempered individual\". But there was another side to his personality; he was a good talker and liked to wear smart clothes, including monogrammed silk shirts. Sutcliffe, a close friend and teammate of Waddington,Howe, pp. 72, 76. called him \"a genial fellow in the dressing room; a man with a rare personality, proof of which is shown by the fact that whenever there was a discussion of any kind in the dressing room, Abe generally ruled it, to all intents and purposes, the chairman.\"Sutcliffe, p. 137. The cricket writer Jim Kilburn wrote that \"at his best, [Waddington] was a magnificently hostile bowler with one of the most beautiful actions ever seen in cricket, and his pace and break-back were a problem for the greatest of batsmen\".Howe, p. 77. The historian Leslie Duckworth summed him up: \"Yes, a man of temper, Waddington, but a fine cricketer.\""]}, {"page": "George Macaulay", "response": ["As a bowler, Macaulay fulfilled two roles. At the start of an innings, when the ball was new and hard, he opened the bowling with medium-fast deliveries that swung away from right-handed batsmen. In this style, he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow considered him to be better than any similar bowler in the 1920s except Maurice Tate, the leading medium paced bowler in England.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 136. Macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on the needs of the match situation and the type of pitch.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 135. When the pitch was suitable for spinning the ball, he bowled medium-paced off breaks. Wisden said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a sticky wicket, a pitch which has been affected by rain, making it erratic and difficult to bat on. His obituary further stated: \"Under suitable conditions for using the off-break, batsmen seemed at his mercy.\" This was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out, but at the same time it was very difficult to score runs against him. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that \"on a rain-damaged pitch he was in his glory.\" He would make small adjustments to the positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of the wicket, often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so. Robertson-Glasgow said that \"only the best could survive the onslaught except by a miracle\", and described Macaulay as a great bowler. The cricket writer Jim Kilburn suggested that Macaulay was \"a great cricketer. He was great not so much in mathematical accomplishment\u00a0... as in cricketing character.\""]}, {"page": "Wilf Barber", "response": ["Barber scored a total of 16,402 runs in his career with 29 hundreds and 182 catches, and was described by Gerald Howat as \"the fourth pillar\" of the Yorkshire batting in the mid-1930s (after Herbert Sutcliffe, Maurice Leyland and Arthur Mitchell). A generally defensive batsman, he played carefully in the tradition of Yorkshire opening batsmen. Jim Kilburn said that Barber was \"small in stature but upright in style\".Hodgson, p. 123. He was a good batsman on the off side and had a very good defensive technique, while his strength on the leg side was noted on his Test debut. Although an opening batsman, he often went in lower down the batting order. He was more comfortable in normal circumstances than in a crisis and did not enjoy batting on difficult pitches. Bill Bowes called him the most correct and orthodox batsman he had seen, even more so than Len Hutton. Barber was a kind, modest man, who never believed that his contribution was good enough, even if he had scored a century.Bowes, p. 145. On his death, Wisden described him as having \"rendered admirable service.\""]}, {"page": "Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927", "response": ["By the end of the 1927 English cricket season, Yorkshire had had a succession of short-term captains. Generally, these men were neither sufficiently good players nor leaders to merit a position in the team, but Yorkshire's side was strong enough to include them in the interest of maintaining amateur leadership. Tactically, Yorkshire's success came not from the captain but from the influence of leading professionals Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson.Rogerson, p. 150.Hill, p. 104. The captain's primary role was the enforcement of discipline: maintaining an amicable attitude within the team during games and ensuring that umpires and opponents were respected. In the early 1920s, Yorkshire had been undisciplined on the field; cricket correspondent Jim Kilburn wrote that they were in danger of becoming \"social outcasts\", and E. W. Swanton commented that Yorkshire's hostile attitude when fielding looked likely to jeopardise their relations with other teams. Matters came to a head in a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield. The crowd became very antagonistic and a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) enquiry found that a Yorkshire player had incited the unrest. Further incidents against Surrey that season led the captain Geoffrey Wilson to resign, though he led the team to the County Championship in each of his three years in charge. His resignation was possibly prompted by the Yorkshire president, Lord Hawke, but Wilson did not like the belligerent nature of the team and found it difficult to handle Rhodes.Hill, pp. 106\u20137."]}, {"page": "J. M. Kilburn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim Kilburn"]}, {"page": "Van Diemen's Land v Port Phillip, 1851", "response": ["It is uncertain precisely when and how cricket began to be played in Australia. It may have arrived along with the First Fleet from England but no records document this. Nevertheless, the game grew relatively quickly. The first recorded match in Australia took place in Sydney in 1803 between the military and civilians; according to the journalists Jim Kilburn and Mike Coward, in a review of Australian cricket, the New South Wales governor ordered that equipment for the game should be made in government workshops.Kilburn and Coward, pp. 61\u201362. Similar early games between the military and civilians took place in Tasmania and Victoria. The vast distances between the colonies initially prevented intercolonial cricket, but clubs quickly came into existence in the population centres and an element of competition soon arose.Kilburn and Coward, p. 62. A combination of the presence of the British military, the attraction of English pastimes that did not require sophisticated venues or practices, and a desire to develop a society similar to that of Britain made cricket an attractive outlet for Australians.Kaufman and Patterson, p. 20. By 1832, the Sydney Gazette was able to state that \"cricket was now the prevailing amusement of the colony and that no gentleman could expect to 'dangle at a lady's apron strings' unless he could boast of his cricket prowess.\"Quoted in Kaufman and Patterson, p. 20. Matches began to be covered by newspapers, and the sport's popularity spread with the population."]}, {"page": "Kilburn (surname)", "response": ["* Jim Kilburn (1909\u20131993), British sports journalist"]}]}}
