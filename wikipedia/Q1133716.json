It was during his term as governor of Trinidad and Tobago that the water riots took place.  They resulted in the destruction of the Red House, the seat of government.\nMoloney was made a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (C.M.G.) the 1882 Birthday Honours, later being promoted to Knight Commander (K.C.M.G.) in the 1890 New Year Honours.Moloney was concerned that the economic value of products of colonies in general, and of those administered by him in his diplomatic roles in particular, should be better propagated, and he believed that this would encourage the economy and provide instruction to the natives. To this end he established an exemplary botanical garden, in 1883, at Kokoinaiko (possibly Okokomaiko), Lagos colony, for the growth of plants of marketable value, including rubber, kola, cotton, shea butter, gum, indigo cacao and others. In his words, \"I thought to conduct this operation in such a manner as to encourage economy, replenishing, and the diffusion of useful and botanical knowledge of commercial importance\". Unfortunately, this garden fell into neglect after he was posted to the British Honduras.Mimetillus moloneyi (Moloney's mimic bat) was named after him.After the death of his first wife, he married on 2 March 1897 Frances Isabella Sophia Mary Lewis (1873\u20131959), daughter of Irish MP Henry Owen Lewis. They moved to Italy in 1911 when his health declined, and he died in Fiesole. His widow returned to Ireland, co-founded the Missionary Sisters of St. Columban, and became a nun.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of colonial governors of the Gambia", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" |Cornelius Alfred MoloneyCMG(1848\u20131913)"]}, {"page": "List of governors of the Windward Islands", "response": ["| || Sir Cornelius Alfred Moloney|| 1897\u20131900||"]}, {"page": "List of governors of Trinidad and Tobago", "response": ["|4 December 1900-August 1904|| Sir Cornelius Alfred Moloney || "]}, {"page": "Cornelius Moloney", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cornelius Alfred Moloney"]}, {"page": "List of Trinidad and Tobago\u2013related topics", "response": ["* Cornelius Alfred Moloney"]}, {"page": "Red House (Trinidad and Tobago)", "response": ["When a woman was arrested by a policeman, the mob became riotous.

Still, the Governor, Sir Cornelius Alfred Moloney, refused to withdraw the Ordinance.  When it became known that the lower storey of the building was on fire, the riot act was read, following which the police opened fire on the crowd.  Sixteen people were killed and forty-two injured, and the Red House was completely gutted. After the fire, only the shell of the original Red House remained."]}]}}
