He was a \"comparativist\" folklore collector, drawing parallels between tales and traditions across cultures. A circumspect scholar, he did not automatically assume similar tales indicated transmission, allowing for that similar tales to arise independently.\nAt the request of the educator Thomas Arnold, he authored a series of textbooks on English, Greek, and other histories, which were adopted at Arnold's Rugby School as well as other public schools.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charites", "response": ["Nonnus gives their three names as Pasithea, Peitho and Aglaia.Nonnus, Dionysiaca 24.261\u20133Thomas Keightley (1838).

Such a rowan is called a \"flying rowan\" and was thought of as especially potent against witches and black magic, and as a counter-charm against sorcery. In 1891, Charles Godfrey Leland also reported traditions of rowan's apotropaic powers against witches in English folklore, citing the Denham Tracts (collected between 1846 and 1859). Rowan also serves as protection against fairies. For example, according to Thomas Keightley mortals could safely witness fairy rades (mounted processions held by the fairies each year at the onset of summer) by placing a rowan branch over their doors."]}, {"page": "Fairy ring", "response": ["Western European traditions, including English, Scandinavian and Celtic, claimed that fairy rings are the result of elves or fairies dancing. Such ideas dated to at least the medi\u00e6val period; The Middle English term elferingewort (\"elf-ring\"), meaning \"a ring of daisies caused by elves' dancing\" dates to the 12th century. In his History of the Goths (1628),  Swedish writer Olaus Magnus makes this connection, saying that fairy rings are burned into the ground by the dancing of elves. British folklorist Thomas Keightley noted that in Scandinavia in the early 19th century, beliefs persisted that fairy rings (elfdans) arose from the dancing of elves. Keightley warned that while entering an elfdans might allow the interloper to see the elves\u2014although this was not guaranteed\u2014it would also put the intruder in thrall to their illusions."]}, {"page": "Merman", "response": ["The Irish narrative about a male merrow named Coomar, described as extremely ugly creatures with green hair, teeth and skin, narrow eyes and a red nose, turned out to be fakelore, the entire \"Soul Cages\" story being invented by Thomas Keightley by adapting one of Grimm's folklore pieces (Deutsche Sagen No. 25, \"Der Wassermann und der Bauer\" or \"The Waterman and the Peasant\")."]}, {"page": "Merrow", "response": ["These tales with commentary were first published in T.

It was immediately translated into German by the Brothers Grimm.

A general sketch of the merrow pieced together by such 19th century authors are as follows.", "While most stories about merrow are about female creatures, a tale about an Irish merman does exist in the form of \"The Soul Cages\", published in Croker's anthology. In it, a merman captured the souls of drowned sailors and locked them in cages (lobster pot-like objects) under the sea. This tale turned out to be an invented piece of fiction (an adaptation of a German folktale), although Thomas Keightley who acknowledged the fabrication claimed that by sheer coincidence, similar folktales were indeed to be found circulated in areas of Cork and Wicklow."]}, {"page": "Skynd", "response": ["The tale was recorded by Just Mathias Thiele in Danmarks folkesagn, who localised it to Skjelver\u00f8d, near Ringsted, where it was supposedly the origin of the place-name \"Kirstens Bjerg\" (Kirsten's hill),Just Mathias Thiele, \"Kirstens Bierg\", Danmarks folkesagn, 3 vols., Volume\u00a02: Sagn om Naturgienstande, Copenhagen: C.

The other collaborators generally allowed Croker to take credit, notably William Maginn, though after his death his kinsmen insisted Maginn had written four or more of the tales. Croker retracted ten tales in his third edition of (1834), and after his death, a fourth edition (1859) appeared which was prefaced with a memoir written by his son.", "Because Croker had lost the manuscript after collecting it from the field, he had to reconstruct the anthology through help from other writers, such as William Maginn, David Richard Pigot, his friend Joseph Humphreys, Thomas Keightley, and R.

Humphreys, a Quaker, was a companion during Croker's excursions into the south 1812\u20131815.

His dinner was left for him in the cellar, but one night the cook left him nothing but part of a herring and some cold potatoes. At midnight Wildbean dragged the cook out of her bed and all the way down the hard cellar stairs, leaving her battered and bruised so that she was bedridden for three weeks.
