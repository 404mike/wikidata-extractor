The advocacy of prayers for the dead (\"these dead birds\") in the final line of the poem corroborates this interpretation.David Beauregard, pp. 141\u2013144. Several critics, including Clare Asquith and David Beauregard, have noted that the poem ostensibly references Catholic liturgy and possibly the writings of the Catholic priest and poet Rev. Robert Southwell, SJ, who translated the Latin hymn Lauda Sion and also authored a poem praising the married chastity of St. Mary and St. Joseph. John Klause argued that the poem has various parallels to the Dies Irae of the Liturgy for the Dead, but suggests that its Catholic imagery satirises conventional Protestant attitudes expressed in Chester's poem, and that it is a subtle protest against the lauding of Sir John Salusbury, whose imagined death he supposes the poem celebrates.", "Clara Longworth first suggested that St. Anne Line is Shakespeare's phoenix and Mark Barkworth, a Catholic priest who reportedly embraced her body as it hung on the scaffold before he was also executed, is the turtle.

In the ensuing years, extreme pressure was placed on England's Catholics to accept the practices of the Church of England, and recusancy laws made illegal any service not found in the Book of Common Prayer, including the Roman Catholic Mass. In Shakespeare's lifetime there was a substantial and widespread quiet resistance to the newly imposed reforms.The Shakespeares and \"the Old Faith\" (1946) by John Henry de Groot; Die Verborgene Existenz Des William Shakespeare: Dichter Und Rebell Im Katholischen Untergrund (2001) by Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel; Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare (2005) by Clare Asquith. Some scholars, using both historical and literary evidence, have argued that Shakespeare was one of these recusants. Rowan Williams, former archbishop of Canterbury, thinks that Shakespeare had a \"recusant Catholic background.\"", "Literary scholar and Jesuit Father Peter Milward and the writer Clare Asquith are among those who have written that Catholic sympathies are detectable in Shakespeare's works.Milward, Peter. The Catholicism of Shakespeare's Plays. Tokyo: Renaissance Institute, Sophia University (1997); reprinted Southampton: Saint Austin Press (1997). .Milward, Peter. Shakespeare the Papist. Ann Arbor, MI: Sapientia Press (2005). . Asquith believed that Shakespeare uses terms such as \"high\" when referring to Catholic characters and \"low\" when referring to Protestants (the terms refer to their altars) and \"light\" or \"fair\" to refer to Catholic and \"dark\" to refer to Protestant, a reference to certain clerical garbs. Asquith also detects in Shakespeare's work the use of a simple code used by the Jesuit underground in England which took the form of a mercantile terminology wherein priests were \"merchants\" and souls were \"jewels\", those pursuing them were \"creditors\", and the Tyburn gallows, where the members of the underground died, was called \"the place of much trading\".Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare (2005) by Clare Asquith. The Jesuit underground used this code so their correspondences looked like innocuous commercial letters, and Asquith believed that Shakespeare also used this code. Asquith's conclusions, however, have met with considerable criticism and evidence of a hidden code has been called \"dubious\". According to professor Jeffrey Knapp, the work of scholars like Peter Milward, who believe that \"the deepest inspiration in Shakespeare's plays is both religious and Christian\", has had \"little influence on recent Shakespeare scholarship\". John Finnis and Patrick Martin have argued more recently that Catholic martyr Anne Line is the eponymous phoenix of The Phoenix and the Turtle and her husband Roger is the eponymous turtle.Times Literary Supplement, 18 April 2003, pp. 12\u201314 They believe, with Asquith, that the poem's \"bird of loudest lay\" represents the composer William Byrd and that the crow is the Jesuit Henry Garnet.Asquith, Clare, Shakespeare Newsletter, 50, 2001."]}, {"page": "Countess of Oxford", "response": ["*Clare Asquith (b. 1951)"]}, {"page": "Pollen baronets", "response": ["*Clare Asquith (born 1951), scholar, great-granddaughter of above"]}, {"page": "Arthur Pollen", "response": ["On 7 September 1898 he married Maud Beatrice, the only daughter of the leading Conservative politician Joseph Lawrence, (later Sir Joseph Lawrence, Bart.) who was also chairman of Linotype & Machinery Co.
