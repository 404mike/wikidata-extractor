At around the same time too, and into the 1970s, the brassi\u00e8re (or bra), which, as noted, had been seen as a liberating innovation in the early part of the century, came to be regarded by some women, such as the Australian academic Germaine Greer (The Female Eunuch, 1969), as an unduly restrictive symbol of traditional womanhood. However, the much-publicised incidence of \"bra burning\" in the 1970s tended to be overstated and came to be satirised: for example, in the 1973 film, Carry On Girls, and a poster by Young & Rubicam,Nick Souter & Auart Newman (1987) The Postter Handbook one of a mildly subversive series for Smirnoff vodka: \"I never thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff\". It was also seen by many, including Greer herself, as a distraction from the cause of women's \"liberation\".In 2013 The Oldie published a cartoon depicting women suffragettes of the early 20th century with the caption \"... but I'm not sure about this proposal to burn our whalebone corsets\" (Oldie, February 2013). A pragmatic 21st-century view was that \"feminism is not about burning your bra in the street. It is about [among other things] women getting up in the morning and leaving the house to go to a job that pays them an actual wage ...\" (Laura Smith, letter in Metro, 30 October 2012).
