Due to these heavy losses suffered by the division (nearly 6,000) in August and September and a severe lack of British infantry replacements in the Mediterranean theatre (although large numbers of anti-aircraft gunners were being retrained as infantry, they had only began their conversion in August and would not available until, at the earliest, October),Blaxland, p. 202. the 8th Royal Fusiliers and 7th Ox and Bucks were both reduced to cadres and transferred to the 168th (London) Brigade, which was being disbanded, with the surplus personnel of the 8th Royal Fusiliers transferring to the 9th Battalion and most of the men of 7th Ox and Bucks transferring to fill gaps in the 2/5th, 2/6th and 2/7th battalions of the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) of the 169th (Queen's) Brigade. They were replaced in the brigade by 1st Battalion, London Scottish and 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles, both from the 168th Brigade, although 1st London Irish had originally been with 167th Brigade at the outbreak of war. This, however, was not actually enough to keep them at full strength and the battalions were placed on a reduced establishment of only three rifle companies. With the autumn rains and the oncoming winter, and no hope of a successful offensive in either weather, the Fifth and Eighth Armies reverted to the defensive and began preparing for an offensive on the Germans in the spring, scheduled for 1 April 1945.Blaxland, p. 239."]}, {"page": "V Corps (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* British 56th Infantry Division (Major-General John Yeldham Whitfield)"]}, {"page": "Operation Grapeshot order of battle", "response": [":* 56th Infantry Division (Major-General John Yeldham Whitfield)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Monte Cassino order of battle January 1944", "response": [":**15th Infantry Brigade (Brigadier E.

Joe, of the U.S. Army Pigeon Service, managed to arrive in time to avoid the bombing, after having flown 20 miles in 20 minutes.

On 2 December, when fighting in front of the Bernhardt Line (a smaller part of the Winter Line), the Queen's Brigade led an assault to capture Monte Camino, which took four days of hard fighting to capture the mountain and saw casualties for 2/5th Queen's, which spearheaded the assault. The commanding officer (CO) of the 2/5th Queen's, Lieutenant Colonel John Yeldham Whitfield, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions in capturing Camino, leading personally from the front with his Webley revolver. He was also awarded the Red Star Order from a general of the Russian Army in Italy. He would later command the 56th Division and it was largely due to him that the brigade avoided being split up and \"retained their integrity as a Queen's Brigade\".Blaxland, pp. 259-260.

The brigade arrived in Egypt on 4 April and, throughout the next few weeks, was brought up to strength from returning wounded and by receiving large drafts of replacements in the form of ex-anti-aircraft gunners of the Royal Artillery, and with the absence of the Luftwaffe now found their original roles redundant, who had been retrained as infantrymen and had to be taught all the infantry weapons. In April the Queen's Brigade was inspected by General Sir Bernard Paget, now Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Command, who had inspected the division nearly two years before when the division was still 'green' and inexperienced and was preparing for overseas service. In late June the Queen's Brigade, now up to strength, learned they were to return to Italy, where they landed on 17 July. While at Tivoli the 169th (Queen's) Brigade, and the whole of the 56th Division, was inspected again by H.M. The King George VI, who had visited them almost exactly two years before when the division was preparing for overseas service. Soon after, on 26 July, the 56th Division received a new General Officer Commanding GOC, Major-General John Yeldham Whitfield, who was previously the CO of the 2/5th Battalion, Queen's before being promoted to command of 13th Brigade (British 5th Division) and returning to take over from Major-General Gerald Templer."]}, {"page": "General Whitfield", "response": ["*John Yeldham Whitfield (1899\u20131971), British Army major general"]}]}}
