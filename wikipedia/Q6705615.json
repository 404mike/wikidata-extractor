Towards the end of the season regular left-half Luther Pemberton was injured and missed the last three games. For the visit of Bolton Wanderers on 23 March 1889 Harry Parkinson got his chance to cover for Pemberton when stand-in James Tattersall was moved back to centre-half. Accrington dominated the first-half but only had a Billy Barbour goal to show for all their pressure at half-time. Accrington were to rue their missed chances as within four minutes of the restart Bolton were 2-1 up. Not long after Bolton took the lead Jack Kirkham of Accrington equalised. It looked like finishing a draw but right at the end Bolton nicked the winner. Parkinson never played for Accrington or League football again."]}]}}
