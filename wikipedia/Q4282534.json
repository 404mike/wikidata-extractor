As captain of fifth-rate HMS Fisgard he took part in a duel with the French ship Immortalit\u00e9 and captured her at the Battle of Tory Island during the French Revolutionary Wars. Then while in command of the third-rate HMS Implacable in the Baltic Sea and attached to the Swedish Navy he took part in the capture the Russian ship Sewolod (Vsevolod) during the Napoleonic Wars.\nDuring his many years of service as Comptroller of the Navy, Martin was credited with reducing the fleet from the enormous size deployed against the French to a much more streamlined service geared toward protecting merchant trade and the British Empire. He also focused heavily on employing highly trained dockyard staff capable of responding rapidly to any international emergency. Martin also sat in Parliament for 14 years and was an outspoken critic of government attempts to reduce the Navy budget which ultimately saw him dismissed in 1831 by his old friend King William IV.\nMartin died in October 1854, at the early stages of the Crimean War, planning the Baltic Campaign and investigating the possibilities of using poison gas weapons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ashtead", "response": ["* Thomas Byam Martin (1773-1854) Royal Navy officer and politician"]}, {"page": "HMS Bellerophon (1786)", "response": ["By July Bellerophon was part of a squadron commanded by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Implacable.
