His work often contrasts material, image and reference in an unusual and humorous way.\nKindness was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He attended the Belfast College of Art and now lives and works in London.\nTypical of Kindness's work is the Treasures of New York series he produced when he spent time in New York in the early 1990s. Here, scenes inspired by contemporary life but modelled in style on Athenian ceramics are painted on panels from New York yellow cabs, equating the significance and stature of contemporary life with that of classical times. He is also known for his use of tiles in sculpture, often contrasting the domestic and static association of tiling with a dynamic and epic subject.\nIn 2014, he received an Individual Support Award from the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ulster University", "response": ["Ulster has a large body of notable alumni, including MPs Kate Hoey, Gregory Campbell, Michelle Gildernew, Roberta Blackman-Woods and former deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Mark Durkan, MLAs Alban Maginness, Basil McCrea and Se\u00e1n Neeson, writers and authors including Anne Devlin, Dinah Jefferies, Colin Duriez, Calum Neill and Aod\u00e1n Mac P\u00f3ilin, poets including Gerald Dawe and Brendan Hamill, and artists including Jack Coulter, Colin Davidson, Oliver Jeffers, Freddie Freeburn, Victor Sloan, Andre Stitt, John Luke and John Kindness.

The critic Dorothy Walker selected Seymour's work for inclusion in the 1986 Guinness Peat Aviation Exhibition and Awards for emerging young artists. He was selected alongside fellow Ulster artists John Kindness and Willie Doherty, but he was not amongst the prizewinners on this occasion. Seymour showed at the annual Oireachtas show in the same year. The Paula Allen Gallery in New York was the venue for Seymour's first transatlantic one-man show in 1987, where he was to exhibit for a further two consecutive years. Seymour received the patronage of The Arts Council of Northern Ireland once more when they hosted a solo exhibition in their Bedford Street gallery in 1989."]}]}}
