The creation of Street Fighter II: Champion Edition was in fact inspired by an argument between two girls over which one of them would play as Chun-Li, which was witnessed by Capcom USA's Jeff Walker who then asked Capcom's founder Kenzo Tsujimoto to make a version allowing both players to play the same character. According to the Smithsonian Museum's Chris Mellisinos, Chun-Li \"was such an anomaly. How many times did you have the chance to play as a strong female character in arcades? She was drawn attractively, just like Ken and Ryu, but in no way was she a diminished character because she was female.\" Video game scholar Jennifer deWinter felt it was furthermore very \"interesting and surprising to have such a strong Chinese character in Chun-Li coming out of a Japanese game.\" Nevertheless, PSM noted by 1997 how \"a vocal minority believes that [gaming's] female characters do very little to attract women. These people argue that Chun Li, Lara Croft, and most other female game characters are designed primarily for a male gamer's satisfaction, and not geared towards the needs of women garners at all.\""]}, {"page": "Watara Supervision", "response": ["Quickshot's UK version of the Supervision was heavily featured for a time on ITV's gaming show Bad Influence!

Its working title was Deep Techies,BUZZ!, a now-defunct video games magazine on ORACLE a colloquial term derived from 'techies' basically meaning technology-obsessed individuals. The show's finished title was a reference to how video games were often viewed by the UK press at the time.", "Bad Influence! began during the 16 bit-era of computer and video gaming, and featured in-depth news, previews and reviews about the very latest in gaming and computer technology. The series ran long enough to feature the launch of the Nintendo 64 console (then acknowledged by its working title, the Ultra 64) in its fourth and final series. The show was originally presented by then children's TV presenters Violet Berlin and Andy Crane (former Children's BBC presenter), who were studio based, and US teen actor Z Wright, who filed location reports from the US until Series 4. There was also a cheats segment character called Nam Rood (which is \"door man\" backwards, played by Andy Wear), an anarchic \"furtler\" who lived in a shed in the first two series, and then in the basement for Series 3. He would give viewers gaming cheats (written on cards he would stick to his forehead) in between mock experiment comedy sketches three times per episode. He would always greet viewers with his trademark catchphrases \"slimy furtlers\" and \"scrotty furtlers\", the term \"furtler\" equating to the term \"techie\". In one 1995 episode he gave a \u201ccheat for Sonic Six\u201d, which did not exist at the time (and neither does today) and thus was a joke.

Although the majority of mid-programme reports were filed from the US by Z Wright, they were sometimes filed by Violet Berlin and on rare occasions by Andy Crane, in place of Z Wright. The programme usually focused on PC and Amiga segments early on in an episode, with more console-based segments later on. There was also a weekly competition towards the end of the programme, directly before one of the show's most distinctive features - the 'Datablast' sequence. The Datablast - which viewers were encouraged to record on their video recorders - consisted of a number of pages of gaming articles and information that were flashed rapidly onto the screen during the credits. Viewers could then read the pages by replaying it in slow motion on their video player. The information consisted of a watered down version of most of that episodes features, as well as some exclusive content, such as Top Ten video games charts.", "In Series 2, as part of a report, Violet Berlin was included as a character in the Mega Drive game Micro Machines 2.

Supersonic asked Big Red Software to assist with the graphics. Most of the background graphics were produced by Mark Neesam, using an Amiga 500. He stated that some graphics were hard, despite having access to the originals, and believed that additional colours enabled him to \"muddy up\" graphics, but also used the increased colour palette to clean some up.
