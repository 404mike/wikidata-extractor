While he was an English writer known primarily for his work on military subjects, he had wide interests. Earlier in his career he was the drama critic for London's Morning Post.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carl von Clausewitz", "response": ["Clausewitz's influence spread to British thinking as well, though at first more as a historian and analyst than as a theorist. See for example Wellington's extended essay discussing Clausewitz's study of the Campaign of 1815\u2014Wellington's only serious written discussion of the battle, which was widely discussed in 19th-century Britain. Clausewitz's broader thinking came to the fore following Britain's military embarrassments in the Boer War (1899\u20131902). One example of a heavy Clausewitzian influence in that era is Spenser Wilkinson, journalist, the first Chichele Professor of Military History at Oxford University, and perhaps the most prominent military analyst in Britain from c. 1885 until well into the interwar period. Another is naval historian Julian Corbett (1854\u20131922), whose work reflected a deep if idiosyncratic adherence to Clausewitz's concepts and frequently an emphasis on Clausewitz's ideas about 'limited objectives' and the inherent strengths of the defensive form of war. Corbett's practical strategic views were often in prominent public conflict with Wilkinson's\u2014see, for example, Wilkinson's article \"Strategy at Sea,\" The Morning Post, 12 February 1912. Following the First World War, however, the influential British military commentator B. H. Liddell Hart in the 1920s erroneously attributed to him the doctrine of \"total war\" that during the First World War had been embraced by many European general staffs and emulated by the British. More recent scholars typically see that war as so confused in terms of political rationale that it in fact contradicts much of On War. That view assumes, however, a set of values as to what constitutes \"rational\" political objectives\u2014in this case, values not shaped by the fervid Social Darwinism that was rife in 1914 Europe. One of the most influential British Clausewitzians today is Colin S. Gray; historian Hew Strachan (like Wilkinson also the Chichele Professor of Military History at Oxford University, since 2001) has been an energetic proponent of the study of Clausewitz, but his own views on Clausewitz's ideas are somewhat ambivalent."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Spenser Wilkinson (1853\u20131937), Britain, military historian"]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Spenser Wilkinson (1853\u20131937)"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Military writers", "response": ["List of all pages in category Military writers retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.

Several years later, in April 1905, Lord Glenesk offered the editorship of The Morning Post to Ware, in part through Milner's influence. Ware accepted, and moved back to England, taking the position in March. Historian A. J. A. Morris writes that Glenesk intended for Ware to \"be the much needed new broom\" for the paper. When Ware became editor, The Morning Post had no offices. Its staff worked instead in temporary wooden sheds. He began expanding the paper by hiring Richard Jebb as a contributor, who in turn hired many other correspondents. The two began to focus the paper on the British Dominions, a move they presented as a means to increase the paper's circulation; though it allowed for new sources of advertising, the move did not lead to higher circulation. Ware aimed to make the paper \"the authority on all colonial questions,\" and supported social and tariff reform. He invited radicals such as William Beveridge and R. H. Tawney to contribute to the paper. Shortly after beginning work, Ware came into conflict with Glenesk, who thought he should not promote tariff reform, and wrote asking Lord Glenesk's daughter, Lady Bathurst, to intervene and threatening to resign. As a result of his initiatives, Ware was disliked by some members of the paper's staff, particularly Spenser Wilkinson, the paper's leader writer, and E. E. Peacock, the paper's manager. Ware also supported Richard Jebb's campaign against respected conservative Robert Cecil for the Marylebone East Parliament seatwhich cost the paper readership."]}, {"page": "Henry Wilkinson", "response": ["* Henry Spenser Wilkinson (1853\u20131937), professor of military history and writer"]}, {"page": "Paddy Griffith", "response": ["Griffith was the founder of the Wargame Developments Group and SMATS (South Manchester Tactical Society)  which is a reincarnation of the Manchester Tactical Society founded by Spenser Wilkinson in the 1880s.

The latter hardened into a detailed examination of the Chartist Movement. His election to the Langton Fellowship in 1911 provided a small income for three years that allowed him to concentrate on that topic rather than teaching, but throughout this time he continued to struggle to repay the money advanced to him by the Board of Education to fund his earlier studies."]}, {"page": "Wilkinson, Spenser", "response": ["#REDIRECT Spenser Wilkinson"]}, {"page": "Lilias Margaret Frances, Countess Bathurst", "response": ["Earlier in 1905, before Lady Bathurst became the owner, Fabian Ware was made editor of The Morning Post.
