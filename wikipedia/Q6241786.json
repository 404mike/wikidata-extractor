Jenkins (19 April 1880 \u2013 1 December 1971) was a Welsh rugby union and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s and 1910s. He played club level rugby union (RU) for Llwynypia RFC and representative level rugby league (RL) for Wales, and at club level for Warrington (Heritage \u2116 139), as a stand-off or scrum-half, i.e. number 6, or 7.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warrington Wolves", "response": ["In 1908, 14 November the first touring Australian rugby league team visited Warrington. The Kangaroos embarked upon a massive six months tour of Britain taking in 45 matches. Their timing was not good as the north of England was hit by strikes in the cotton mills, which badly affected attendances as fans could not afford to watch the pioneering Aussies. On Saturday 14 November 1908 Warrington played the Kangaroos. Warrington won the match 10\u20133, with Jackie Fish the hero scoring one try and Ike Taylor the other, Fish and George Dickenson kicked a goal each. A crowd of 5,000 watched the match at Wilderspool. The Warrington team that day was Jimmy Tilley, Jack Fish, George Dickenson, Ike Taylor, Lewis Treharne, Ernest Brooks, John Jenkins, William Dowell, Alfred Boardman, Billy O'Neill, George Thomas, Peter Boardman, and John Willie Chester. The Australians came back to Wilderspool for \"revenge\" later in the tour but tries from Jack Fish, and John Jenkins earned the 'Wirepullers' an 8\u20138 draw. Two members of the Kangaroo squad, Dan Frawley and Larry O'Malley later signed for Warrington and played the next season at Wilderspool. Warrington have the best record of any club side against the touring Kangaroos with eight wins, one draw, and seven defeats from sixteen matches.http://www.warringtonwolves.org/100-years-since-wire-took-on-the-aussies-for-the-first-time-2372"]}, {"page": "John Jenkins", "response": ["John Jenkins may refer to:", "*John Jenkins (governor) (died 1681), colonial governor of North Carolina", "*John Jenkins (Australian politician) (1851\u20131923), American-born Premier of South Australia", "*John Jenkins (British politician) (1852\u20131936), British politician, MP for Chatham, 1906\u20131910", "*John Jenkins (American politician) (1952-2020), Maine state senator, mayor and candidate for Governor of Maine", "*Sir John Jenkins (diplomat) (born 1955), British ambassador to Saudi Arabia", "*John Jenkins (Welsh politician) (born 1981), local politician in Wales", "*John Jenkins (composer) (1592\u20131678), English composer", "*John Jenkins (poet) (born 1949), Australian poet", "*John Jenkins (jazz musician) (1931\u20131993), American saxophonist", "*John Jenkins (American football coach) (born 1952), American football coach", "*John Jenkins (defensive tackle) (born 1989), American football player", "*John Jenkins (Australian footballer) (1936\u20131980), Australian footballer for Richmond and North Melbourne", "*John Jenkins (baseball) (1896\u20131968), Chicago White Sox baseball player", "*John Jenkins (basketball) (born 1991), American basketball player", "*John Jenkins (figure skater) (born 1970), British figure skater", "*John Jenkins (rugby) (1880\u20131971), Welsh rugby union and rugby league footballer", "*John Jenkins (penmanship) (1755\u20131822), American schoolteacher who devised a popular style of penmanship", "*John Jenkins (Ifor Ceri) (1770\u20131829), Welsh Church of England priest and antiquarian", "*Rev.
