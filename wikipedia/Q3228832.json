Despite not starting a game during his month-long loan spell, Pouton impressed sufficiently in his six substitute appearances to prompt Grimsby to pay \u00a3150,000 to secure him on a permanent basis. Upon signing, Pouton became a first team regular and went on to play in the majority of Grimsby's games that season. Surprisingly, in hindsight, Pouton only picked up two bookings that season in 41 games. His first goal for Grimsby (and only goal of the season) was an equaliser at Blundell Park, Pouton volleyed in at the far post after Nicky Weaver parried Lee Ashcroft's cross in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester City. Over the next three seasons, Pouton was booked 18 times and sent off twice. Despite his occasional lapses in discipline, Pouton was generally a success at Grimsby, and although he was not noted for his goals, he still managed eleven goals including a hat-trick in the 6\u20132 home win against Wimbledon (although two of those goals were penalties). He became a cult hero for his Never Say Die attitude, and his repeat step-overs, although he suffered increasing disciplinary problems, missing many games through a combination of injury and suspension. In the 2002-03 season, Grimsby were relegated to Division Two after finishing bottom of Division One. Injury prevented Pouton from playing until December and he only then played five times before leaving the club to free up finances."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Lee Ashcroft"]}, {"page": "Paul McKenna (footballer)", "response": ["In January 2016 McKenna took up a coaching role at Longridge Town alongside former Preston North End teammate Lee Ashcroft.
