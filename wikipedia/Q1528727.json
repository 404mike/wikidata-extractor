Although born in Northern England, Wilson played the majority of his football career in Italy.\nAt club level he played as a defender for Internapoli and Lazio, as well as representing the Italy national football team three times in 1974.

Lazio improved such successes the following season, ensuring its first title in 1973\u201374. However, tragic deaths of Re Cecconi and Scudetto trainer Maestrelli, as well as the departure of Chinaglia, would be a triple blow for Lazio.
