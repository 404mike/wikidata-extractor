The character has previously been portrayed by Kylie Flinker and Sasha Close. She was created by producer Reg Watson as one of the serial's original characters. Lucy was a prominent figure during the early 1990s of Neighbours, with Bell playing her on and off for five years. Portrayed originally as being clever, a recast was implemented to fit the character's transformation and she became the stereotype of a ditzy blonde female. She has been involved in storylines including battling a brain tumour, coping with blindness, incest, modelling and addictions to drugs, alcohol and spending. She has also been positively and negatively received by critics for her \"busty blonde\" image while played by Bell. After making a brief return on 6 May 2013, Lucy made subsequent return visits until 2016.

They compared this with Bell's portrayal, stating that she changed the character positively into the 'blonde, busty, saucy Lucy', they also slated her portrayal branding her acting as poor and ruining the character, but added that the positive attribute was she looked like all the other 'blondes' suddenly invading Aussie soaps around the time of the 1990s.
