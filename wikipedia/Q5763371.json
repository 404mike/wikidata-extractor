The original manuscript is known in academic circles as Cotton Nero A.x, following a naming system used by one of its owners, Robert Cotton, a collector of Medieval English texts. Before the manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile of Bank in Yorkshire. Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton's History edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown.Turville-Petre, Thorlac. The Alliterative Revival. Woodbridge: Brewer etc., 1977. pp.\u00a0126\u2013129. Burrow, J. Ricardian Poetry. London: Routledge and K. Paul, 1971.  pp. 4\u20135 Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, so the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, though it is highly unlikely that they ever met.\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Medieval Period, Vol. 1., ed. Joseph Black, et al. Toronto: Broadview Press, Introduction, p.\u00a0235.  The three other works found in the same manuscript as Pearl (commonly known as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Cleanness or Purity) are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet, known by scribal errors. Suggested emandations may be found in \"Patience: An Alliterative Version of \"Jonah\" by the Poet of \"Pearl.\"\"Patience: An Alliterative Version of \"Jonah\" by the Poet of \"Pearl.\" Ed. Israel Gollancz, Oxford University Press, 1924  Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single-authorship.Nelles, William. \"The Pearl-Poet\".

Israel Gollancz also suggested that Polonius might have been a satire on Burghley. The theory was often finessed with supplementary arguments,See, for example, Lilian Winstanley, Hamlet and the Scottish Succession, 1921, 112; 114\u2013118; John Dover Wilson, The Essential Shakespeare, 1937, 104; Joel Hurstfield, The Queen's Wards, 1958, 257; A.L.

It has often been assumed that the story is ultimately derived from an Old Icelandic poem, but no such poem has been found; the extant Icelandic versions, known as the Ambales-saga, or Amloda-saga are considerably later than Saxo.Israel Gollancz, Hamlet in Iceland : being the Icelandic romantic Ambales saga, (1898)."]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Sir Israel Gollancz, Shakespeare expert"]}, {"page": "Walter William Skeat", "response": ["According to A.
