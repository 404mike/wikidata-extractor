She was also an adept writer and poet, particularly using verse as an aid and means of communication in times of mourning. When her younger brother Tom died after falling from a boat into a lake at Grimsthorpe on 5 August 1778 Elizabeth penned a widely circulated verse to his lyre that received a published response from a local poet. Her elegy, entitled On her Brother's Violin, was later reproduced in the 1785 edition of The Annual Register. She also wrote an ode concerning the death from tuberculosis of her sister Mary on 27 July 1787. Letters between Elizabeth and Sheridan took the form of verse both before and during their marriage. David Garrick also corresponded with her, affectionately referring to her as The Saint; historian Giles Waterfield quotes Garrick as asking: \"What is my thought like? Why is Mrs Sheridan like a cat?\""]}, {"page": "Waterfield", "response": ["* Giles Waterfield (1949\u20132016), British novelist, art historian and curator"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of The Courtauld Institute of Art", "response": ["* Giles Waterfield, novelist"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Giles Waterfield, 67, art historian and curator (Dulwich Picture Gallery)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2016", "response": ["*Giles Waterfield, 67, British art historian and curator (Dulwich Picture Gallery), heart attack.Giles Waterfield, the director who modernised Dulwich Picture Gallery, has died"]}, {"page": "Erica O'Donnell", "response": ["O'Donnell noticed that no university or other institution ran a course that covered all elements of the fine and decorative arts. With the support of Sir Trenchard Cox of the Victoria and Albert Museum, O'Donnell established and designed a course for those wishing to work in museums, as auctioneers, art students, or those who owned or ran country houses. The course was convened in the V&A's galleries and lecture hall, and O'Donnell recruited from the Courtauld Institute and the museum to lecture. It was colloquially known as the \"V. & A. course\". From these informal roots, O'Donnell founded the Study Centre for the History of the Fine and Decorative Arts in 1964. The course received far more applications than places, and the demand led to other universities establishing their own, similar courses. Helena Hayward later ran the course with her, and with Hayward and Harriet Bridgeman she published books on fine art. Some of the graduates from the course during O'Donnell's tenure included Giles Waterfield and Timothy Schroder."]}]}}
