He took a particular interest in India.\nBorn in Witton Park, County Durham, he went to Elmfield College, York, and came from a family of Primitive Methodists. An engineer by training, he later went into business as a builder's merchant. Before entering politics, he was a lay preacher in the Methodist Church.\nAt the 1918 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Bishop Auckland, and held the seat until his death at the age of fifty. In Parliament, he found himself at odds with many Labour MPs and contemplated joining the Liberal Party. He was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip in 1924, when he was made a Privy Councillor.\nHe had suffered from poor health since contracting malaria at Salonika during World War I. On a visit to London in December 1928, he was found dead in bed at the Regent Palace Hotel. At the inquest, his son said that his father had taken to drinking heavily. His death, it was decided, was due to syncope from disease of the heart and liver, due to chronic alcoholism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1910\u20131936)", "response": ["*Ben Spoor (1878\u20131928)"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury", "response": ["*Ben Spoor 1924"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ben Spoor"]}, {"page": "Witton Park", "response": ["*Henry Bolckow, the German partner of Bolckow Vaughan became a Member of Parliament as did Witton Park (and later Bishop Auckland) tradesman Ben Spoor."]}, {"page": "First MacDonald ministry", "response": ["| Ben Spoor"]}, {"page": "Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Ben Spoor", "*Labour: Ben Spoor"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Ben Spoor"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ben Spoor"]}, {"page": "Tracy Philipps", "response": ["From 1923 to 1925 Philipps was in Khartoum, occupying a position within the Sudan Political Service.
