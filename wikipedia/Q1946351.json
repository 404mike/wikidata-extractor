After the war she played hockey for England touring the USA in 1947. The team included her sister Bridget West and Mary Russell Vick.  They played 18 matches on that tour with one goalkeeper confused when two identical players both had a try at scoring a goal. The sisters were lifelong chums and in 1971 they were asked to look after the klaxon during a Scotland-England hockey match. They were so engrossed in the game that they forget to ring the klaxon and Scotland won the game 2-1."]}]}}
