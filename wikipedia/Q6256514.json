He usually played suspicious-looking characters, often Germanic in origin.\" His screen roles included William Shakespeare in the comic fantasy Time Flies (1944), Grimstone in the Gothic melodrama Uncle Silas (1947), and the librarian in the supernatural thriller Night of the Demon (1957). He played Colonel Wentzel in the Adventures of William Tell \"The Shrew\" episode (1958). \nJohn Salew was active into the TV era, playing the sort of character parts that John McGiver played in the US", "link_mentions": {}}}
