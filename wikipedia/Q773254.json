Tandy had an impressive first season in the championship, finishing as runner-up in the standings, with 365 points. Although, he was over 150 points behind dominating champion Nathan Freke. Tandy had started out at the Raysport team but with his car lacking upgrades, decided to jump ship with four races to go and become the first driver for his brother's newly setup team. A win and a second place at both Thruxton and Castle Combe allowed Tandy to overhaul Peter Dempsey, Christian Ebbesvik and James Nash to achieve that runner-up position behind Freke. He then proceeded to win the 2006 Formula Ford Festival on the road, before a 10-second penalty was added post-race for a safety car misdemeanour, dropping him to fifth. He continued in the championship in 2007, but finished one place lower in the standings, finishing third overall. Tandy and James Nash were involved in a titanic battle for the runner-up spot (as Callum MacLeod finishing some 130 points clear of the pair), which was eventually settled by just twelve points. Tandy won six races throughout the season, and finished on the podium on ten other occasions.  After his close call the previous year, Tandy won the Formula Ford Festival at the end of the season, but only after MacLeod was given a two-second penalty post-race."]}, {"page": "Daniel Morad", "response": ["With A1GP's closing at the end of the season, Morad did not drive in any other series in 2009 but joined Status Grand Prix in the GP3 Series for 2010.
