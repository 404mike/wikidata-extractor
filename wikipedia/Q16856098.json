These decades of economic prosperity combined high productivity with high average wages and high consumption, and were also characterised by a highly developed system of social benefits. According to various studies, the real purchasing power of the average French worker's salary went up by 170% between 1950 and 1975, while overall private consumption increased by 174% in the period 1950-74.The New France: A Society in Transition 1945-1977 (Third Edition) by John Ardagh The French standard of living, which had been damaged by both World Wars, became one of the world's highest.
