While at Harvard, Davis led the CfA (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) galaxy survey, the first redshift survey of galaxies, which motivated his interest in N-body simulations of the Universe.  In the 1980s, Davis, now at Berkeley, was part of a collaboration\u2014with George Efstathiou, Carlos Frenk, and Simon White\u2014that established the validity of the \"cold dark matter\" theory for the formation of galaxies and other cosmic structures, now the accepted interpretation in cosmology. In a classic series of papers, that collaboration\u2014often called DEFW by their peers\u2014used computer code to simulate the growth of the universe and resolve disputes among theoretical models."]}]}}
