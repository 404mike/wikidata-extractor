They took their work seriously, playing together for as much as eleven hours a day. Their first live gig as Genesis followed in September 1969 at a teenager's birthday. It was the start of a series of live shows in small venues across the UK, which included a radio performance broadcast on the BBC's Night Ride show, on 22 February 1970, and a spot at the Atomic Sunrise Festival held at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm a month later. During this time the band met with various record labels regarding contract offers. Initial discussions with Chris Blackwell of Island and Chris Wright of Chrysalis were unsuccessful. In March 1970, during the band's six-week Tuesday night residency at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, members of Rare Bird, whom Genesis had previously supported live, recommended the band to producer and A&R man John Anthony of Charisma Records. Anthony attended one of their shows and enjoyed them enough to convince his boss, label owner Tony Stratton-Smith, to watch their next appearance. Stratton-Smith recalled, \"Their potential was immediately apparent ... the material was good and their performance was good ... It was a long shot, because they needed time to find their strength ... but I was prepared to make that commitment\".

Horn thought the presentation of Hadley's voice on \"Paint Me Down\" and \"She Loved Like Diamond\" was unflattering, and once the reworking of \"Instinction\" began, Hadley was relieved to find that Horn was willing to listen to what he had to say and felt that Horn used the individual strengths of each member to bring out the best in all of them. \"Instinction\" reached number 10 in the UK. Their next album, True, included the song \"Gold\", which was another attempt at the eastern European style of music Kemp experimented with on \"She Loved Like Diamond\"."]}]}}
