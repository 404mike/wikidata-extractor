Altman wanted to create an Agatha Christie-like country house murder mystery that explored that way of life; he called the film a \"classic situation: all suspects under one roof\". Altman was also inspired by the 1930s films, The Rules of the Game and Charlie Chan in London. Altman chose British actor and writer Julian Fellowes to write the screenplay, because Fellowes knew how country houses operated. Fellowes, who had never written a feature film before, received a telephone call from Altman, who asked him to come up with some characters and stories. Fellowes was given a brief outline of the film: it was to be \"set in a country house in the '30s and to have a murder in there somewhere, but for it to really be an examination of class.\" Altman also wanted the film to explore the three groups of people: the family, the guests, and the servants. Of the call, Fellowes said, \"All the way through I thought this can't be happening\u2014a 50-year-old fat balding actor is phoned up by an American movie director\u2014but I did work as if it was going to happen.\"", "Category:Films with screenplays by Julian Fellowes"]}, {"page": "Uckfield", "response": ["* Uckfield was featured in Julian Fellowes's novel Snobs (2004), which includes fictional characters the Marquess and Marchioness of Uckfield."]}, {"page": "Saltaire", "response": ["*The English Game (Netflix series written by Julian Fellowes)"]}]}}
