While he was there, he was known for winning both athletic (track and field) events and cycling events on the same day, which the Irish Post and Weekly Telegraph claimed, \"a feat for which we believe the history of the college races does not afford a parallel.\"From 1913 to 1915 he spent time studying medicine in the US. He was on board the RMS Lusitania when it sank in 1915, and was lucky to survive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1912 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Ralph Mecredy", "| Francis Guy  Ralph Mecredy  John Walker  Michael Walker"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team time trial", "response": ["|align=left| Ralph Mecredy || 80 || 13:03:39.0"]}, {"page": "Richard J.
