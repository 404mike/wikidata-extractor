During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on flashcards.  The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as \"What's your favourite colour?\" and \"What's your favourite food?\", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death).  Questions such as \"When was the last time you were violent?\", followed immediately by \"Were you in the right?\", were answered in the order they were presented. Roger \"The Hat\" Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid.  Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied \"...\u00a0give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock\u00a0...\" When asked about death he responded \"live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me\u00a0...\" Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: \"I've been mad for fucking years absolutely years\". The band's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during \"Brain Damage\" and \"Speak to Me\".  His second wife, Patricia \"Puddie\" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the \"geezer\" who was \"cruisin' for a bruisin used in the segue between \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\", and the words \"I never said I was frightened of dying\" heard halfway through \"The Great Gig in the Sky\"."]}, {"page": "Naomi Watts", "response": ["Naomi Ellen Watts was born on 28 September 1968, in Shoreham, Kent, England. She is the daughter of Myfanwy (Miv) Edwards (n\u00e9e Roberts), an antiques dealer and costume and set designer, and Peter Watts (1946\u20131976), a road manager and sound engineer who worked with Pink Floyd.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2003. Miv was born in England but lived in Australia between the ages of one and seven. Watts's maternal grandfather was Welsh and her maternal grandmother was Australian.", "Watts's parents divorced when she was four years old. After the divorce, Watts and her elder brother, Ben Watts, moved several times across South East England with their mother. Peter Watts left Pink Floyd in 1974, and remarried in 1976. In August 1976, he was found dead in a flat in Notting Hill, of an apparent heroin overdose."]}, {"page": "Ummagumma", "response": ["On the rear cover, roadies Alan Styles (who also appears in \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\") and Peter Watts are shown with the band's equipment laid out on a taxiway at London Biggin Hill Airport. This concept was proposed by Mason, with the intention of replicating the \"exploded\" drawings of military aircraft and their payloads, which were popular at the time. The inner gatefold art shows separate black-and-white photos of the band members. Gilmour is seen standing in front of the Elfin Oak. Original vinyl editions showed Waters with his first wife, Judy Trim, but she has been cropped out of the picture on most CD editions (with the original photo's caption \"Roger Waters (and Jude)\" accordingly changed to just \"Roger Waters\"). The uncropped picture was restored for the album's inclusion in the box set Oh, by the Way."]}, {"page": "Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii", "response": ["The band insisted on playing live, and brought their regular touring gear with them. Their roadie, Peter Watts, suggested that the 8-track recorder would produce a sound comparable to a studio recording. In addition, the natural echo of the amphitheatre provided good acoustics for the recording. The equipment was carried by truck from London and took three days to reach Pompeii. When it arrived, it was discovered there was insufficient power to drive it correctly. This problem plagued filming for several days, and was finally resolved by running a lengthy cable from the local town hall.", "* Sound: Charles Rauchet, Peter Watts"]}, {"page": "Brain Damage (song)", "response": ["Some releases of Dark Side of the Moon, for example TC-SHVL. 804 (cassette, New Zealand release) and Q4SHVL 804 (quad LP, UK release) have a different mix of \"Brain Damage\". During the closing instrumental, beginning at about 3:02, after the second chorus and leading into the final track, \"Eclipse\", only Peter Watts' \"lunatic laughing\" is heard, repeatedly, unlike other versions which have the speech sample \"I can't think of anything to say\", then Peter Watts' laugh and another sample \"I think it's marvelous (ha ha ha)\".", "The uncredited manic laughter is that of Pink Floyd's then-road manager, Peter Watts."]}, {"page": "Speak to Me", "response": ["*Manic laughter of Peter Watts, also heard in \"Brain Damage\""]}, {"page": "Ben Watts", "response": ["Watts was brought up in Australia.
