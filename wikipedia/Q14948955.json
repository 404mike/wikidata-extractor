Hogge at first wanted to be teacher. He began as pupil teacher in Edinburgh and was a 1st class King's Scholar at Moray House Training College, Edinburgh but he then qualified as a preacher in the United Free Church of Scotland. However, after engaging in work in the Edinburgh slums, he changed career again to concentrate on social work and research; first in Edinburgh, then in York with Joseph Rowntree and his son Seebohm. On 4 February 1905, Hogge married Florence Rebecca Metcalfe, a widow from Malton in Yorkshire. They had one son and two daughters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "H. H. Asquith", "response": ["Although accounts differ as to the exact numbers, around 29 uncouponed Liberals had been elected, only three with any junior ministerial experience, not all of them opponents of the coalition. There was widespread discontent at Asquith's leadership, and Sir T. A. Bramsdon, who said that he had been elected at Portsmouth only by promising not to support Asquith, protested openly at his remaining leader from outside the Commons. At first Lloyd George extended the government whip to all Liberal MPs. On 3 February 23 non-coalition Liberals formed themselves into a \"Free Liberal\" group (soon known as the \"Wee Frees\" after a Scottish religious sect of that name); they accepted Asquith's appointment of Sir Donald Maclean as chairman in his absence but insisted that George Rennie Thorne, whom Asquith had appointed Chief Whip, hold that job jointly with James Hogge, of whom Asquith and Maclean had a low opinion. After a brief attempt to set up a joint committee with the Coalition Liberal MPs to explore reunion, the \"Wee Frees\" resigned the government whip on 4 April, although some Liberal MPs still remained of uncertain allegiance. The Liberals won by-elections in March and April 1919, but thereafter Labour performed better than the Liberals in by-elections."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James Hogge"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James Hogge"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|James Hogge"]}, {"page": "James myles hogge", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Hogge "]}, {"page": "James Hogg (disambiguation)", "response": ["* James Hogge (1873\u20131928), British social researcher and politician"]}, {"page": "National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers", "response": ["Although the Federation initially invited senior military figures to its meetings, they refused.
