He was widely regarded as one of the greatest trainers in history. Cecil was Champion Trainer 10 times and trained 25 domestic Classic winners, comprising four winners of The Derby, eight winners of The Oaks, six winners of the 1,000 Guineas, three of the 2,000 Guineas and four winners of the St Leger Stakes. His success in The Oaks and the 1,000 Guineas made him particularly renowned for his success with fillies. He was noted for his mastery at Royal Ascot, where he trained 75 winners.Describing his approach to training, Cecil told The Daily Telegraph: \"I do everything by instinct really, not by the book. I like to think I\u2019ve got a feeling for and understand my horses, that they tell me what to do really.\"Cecil was knighted for services to horse racing in the Queen's 2011 Birthday Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberdeen", "response": ["* Henry Cecil, one of the most successful horse trainers of all time."]}, {"page": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing", "response": ["|Henry Cecil", "|Henry Cecil"]}, {"page": "Epsom Derby", "response": ["| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil"]}, {"page": "2000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil"]}, {"page": "St Leger Stakes", "response": ["| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil"]}, {"page": "Irish Derby", "response": ["| Henry Cecil", "| Henry Cecil"]}, {"page": "Marquess of Exeter", "response": ["Another member of the Cecil family was the naval commander Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon (a title which became extinct on his death in 1638).
