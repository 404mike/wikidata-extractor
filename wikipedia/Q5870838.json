For the Tranmere Rovers game Richard Lee returned to the Brentford goal after injury and replaced David Button who was suspended after his sending off against Bradford City. Brentford started strong and scored twice in the first 15 minutes through Martin Taylor and Clayton Donaldson (Taylor's goal believed to be the fastest goal scored by a debutant for Brentford in the league). Tranmere got a goal back just before halftime and came out dominant in the second half with Adam Dugdale scoring to level the game. Donaldson added another for Brentford before Tranmere again equalised in the 90th minute with a strike from substitute Cole Stockton. The game looked to be heading for a draw until Dugdale handled in the area to concede a penalty which Adam Forshaw converted to give Brentford their first away win. Teixeira came on as a second-half substitute for George Saville to make his league debut.", "Brentford slumped to their 4th league defeat of the season following a 2\u20131 defeat at Stevenage which saw Jonathan Douglas return to the team after injury. Donaldson put Brentford ahead in the 13th minute to score his 5th of the campaign, but Stevenage responded swiftly through Fran\u00e7ois Zoko. Zoko doubled his tally 11 minutes later which was enough to secure victory for the Boro and leave the Bees 11th place in the table. After going a goal down against Colchester United a third straight league defeat seemed to be on the cards before three goals in eleven minutes turned the game. Marcello Trotta levelled the score in the 76th minute before George Saville netted his first league goal to put the Bees ahead. Kadeem Harris scored the third goal on his club debut following his loan from Cardiff City, and guaranteed the points and the win.", "Brentford began November with an away win at Crawley Town. Kyle McFadzean tripped Kadeem Harris in the Crawley box to concede a penalty which Adam Forshaw converted to score his third goal of the season. Ex-Bee Marcus Gayle's Staines Town were Brentford's opponents in the first round of the 2013\u201314 FA Cup. Ben Nugent started in place of the suspended Harlee Dean and goals from Alan McCormack, Jake Reeves, Kadeem Harris, Marcello Trotta and Clayton Donaldson sealed a 5\u20130 win for the Bees. Crewe Alexandra were the next visitors to Griffin Park and they departed on the wrong end of another 5\u20130 scoreline. Crewe defended well until the deadlock was broken on the 43rd minute by Marcello Trotta with a long range header. Brentford came out for the second half strong and immediately added a second through Forshaw. George Saville increased the lead in the 58th minute before Donaldson netted twice bringing his league goal tally to eight.", "February 1993 was the last time that Brentford had visited Molineux and it was the venue for the Bees 17th league fixture of the season. The 0\u20130 scoreline was a fair reflection of the solid defensive displays by both sides, and although Wolves had the greater possession, Brentford notched up more on-target shots and remained 4th in the league table. Brentford's unbeaten run continued three days later with a 3\u20132 victory over Peterborough United. An early own goal from Gabriel Zakuani gave the Bees a one nil lead at the break, but Peterborough came back and gained the lead with goals from Jack Payne and Britt Assombalonga in the 59th and 60th minutes. The visitors defended their lead well until a reshuffle of the Brentford team led to an equaliser from George Saville (later attributed to Will Grigg), with the comeback completed in the 87th minute via Donaldson.", "Injuries to first choice defenders Harlee Dean and Alan McCormack saw Nico Yennaris and d\u00e9butante James Tarkowski start as Brentford travelled to Carlisle. The match, in which both teams had good chances to score, ended in a 0\u20130 draw leaving Brentford in third position as Leyton Orient and Wolves both won. After a quiet first half against Bradford, Clayton Donaldson fired home from outside the box to put the home team ahead. George Saville added a second to hand the Bees a 2\u20130 win. Three days later Brentford entertained Tranmere at Griffin Park. James Tarkowski scored his first goal for the club with a powerful second half header before Donaldson wrapped up the win twelve minutes later. The match against early league leaders and promotion rivals Leyton Orient was an early kick off to accommodate the live TV broadcast. Marcello Trotta netted in first half injury time what turned out to be the only goal of the match, and 10-man Brentford held on for the win following the sending off of James Tarkowski early in the second half, moving the team up to 2nd place in the league.", "With four matches of the season remaining Brentford could mathematically secure promotion if they won against Preston, Leyton Orient lost to Crawley and Rotherham either drew or lost to Wolves. Brentford started well with Alan Judge converting a penalty after George Saville was brought down. A second penalty awarded in the second half was scuffed by Judge as he slipped during his run up, but despite a late surge from Preston, Brentford held on for the win. As word spread around Griffin Park that Orient had lost and Rotherham were losing, fans flooded onto the pitch to celebrate, but a late comeback from Rotherham prevented confirmation of the promotion. Brentford's 21-year wait to return to the 2nd tier was confirmed a few minutes later as Wolves scored two late goals to beat Rotherham 6\u20134.", "* 24 June: Alan McCormack joins on a 2-year contract from Swindon Town. 20-year-old George Saville joins on loan from Chelsea until 5 January 2014", "| George Saville", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |George Saville", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |George Saville", "| George Saville"]}, {"page": "Jack Price (footballer, born 1992)", "response": ["In the 2014\u201315 season, Price found himself out of the first team, slipping down the pecking order following the arrival of Tommy Rowe and George Saville, together with strong performances  from Lee Evans and Kevin McDonald.
