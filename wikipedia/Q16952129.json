In the show, Klarion is depicted as a Lord of Chaos, and is far more powerful and villainous than his comic book counterpart. In \"Denial\" he collaborates with Abra Kadabra into trying to steal the Helmet of Nabu from Kent Nelson, kidnapping him and entering the Tower of Fate when the team opens the way looking for Kent. While later battling Doctor Fate, it is noted that Teekl is Klarion's \"familiar\", keeping him anchored to the present reality. In \"Revelation\", he is revealed to be L-7 of The Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors). In \"Misplaced\", Klarion the Witch Boy summons Wotan, Blackbriar Thorn, Felix Faust, and Wizard to Roanoke Island in a plot to get rid of all the adults with a powerful spell. This ends up getting the team, Zatanna, and Billy Batson to team up to find the source of the adult's disappearance-revealed to be that the world has been split into one dimension with kids and one that has adults. The team ends up finding Klarion on Roanoke Island within the kids dimension, while in the adults' dimension, Captain Marvel, Zatara, Batman, and Red Tornado end up attacking the other sorcerers. Zatanna dons the Helmet of Fate to fight Klarion until Nabu starts to lose her, due to the helmet (and thus Fate) being split across both mirrored dimensions. The Nabu-empowered Zatanna manages to subdue Klarion enabling both her and Zatara to break the spell, although Klarion escapes. In a meeting with The Light, Klarion and Brain reveal that the dimensional split was a diversion that allowed Riddler and Sportsmaster to steal a piece of Starro from S.T.A.R. Labs. In \"Insecurity\", Sportsmaster and Professor Ivo meet up with Klarion and Brain to study the Starro sample. In \"Auld Acquaintance\", Klarion helped Vandal Savage apply Starro-Tech on the entire Justice League to mind-control the heroes. In \"Summit\" Klarion remained largely silent and hidden from view during the Light's summit with the Reach within the caves of Santa Prisca. During the three-way fight between the Team, the Light, and the Reach, Klarion transforms a sword into a fire snake to subdue Miss Martian while he escaped with Vandal Savage. In \"Early Warning\", Klarion experiments on creating new metahuman teens and then combining them into an ominous, sinister abomination. His plan was thwarted by Beast Boy's Outsiders and Zatanna, the latter who teleports Klarion into the Tower of Fate, which the Lord of Chaos desperately tries to escape from. In Young Justice: Phantoms, Klarion is confronted by another Lord of Chaos named Child, who is determined to replace him on Earth. Their conflict resulted in Teekl's demise, causing Klarion to lose his anchor to the earthly plane. However, he manages transport himself ten years into the past and possesses a school bus and time travels through various instances in the series in an attempt to return to the present."]}, {"page": "Felix Faust", "response": ["During the Forever Evil storyline, Felix Faust is among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #6 In the pages of Forever Evil: Blight, Felix Faust and Nick Necro are seen torturing Mindwarp for Ultraman, eventually killing him, in an attempt to create rechargeable specimens, having previously done so with Sargon the Sorcerer.Trinity of Sin: Phantom Stranger #15 When John Constantine's group arrives in the Nanda Parbat temple, they eventually come across the project that Nick Necro and Felix Faust has been working on.
