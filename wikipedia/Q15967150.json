The statement added: \"During its five years of operation, the NBS, under its principal, Michael Bukht, has achieved an outstanding reputation for practical vocational training in broadcast programming, journalism and engineering.\"National Broadcasting School, Press release, 11 July 1985", "Michael Bukht claimed that more than 3,000 broadcasters trained at the school between 1980 and 1985, but of this figure, only 500 or so took the flagship intensive 13 week courses in radio (and later television) journalism, and music radio presentation and production. Bukht was proud that at one point half of all the programme controllers in the UK had been trained at the National Broadcasting School, by a training staff which never numbered more than a handful.  But pirate radio \"anoraks\" were also quick to note in 1985 that many of those who had trained at NBS in the previous five years were broadcasting on the current crop of pirate stations.Anorak UK Weekly Report, no.64, 21 July 1985, p.1  http://www.dxarchive.com/pdf/auk/auk_issues_062-065_july_1985.pdf"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Michael Bukht \u2013 Radio executive"]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Michael Bukht, television chef ('Michael Barry') (b. 1941)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2011", "response": ["*Michael Bukht, 69, British radio executive, television personality and chef who worked as Michael Barry."]}, {"page": "Mirza Michael John Bukht", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Bukht"]}, {"page": "Neil Spence", "response": ["Spence's first training job was in the late 1960s at the \"London Broadcasting School\" run by his ex-colleague Earl Richmond.
