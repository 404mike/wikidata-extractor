However this time around Beck was less than successful and was sacked half-way through the 2001\u201302 season to be replaced by veteran striker John Taylor who was given the role of player-manager. Taylor took Cambridge United to the final of the LDV Vans Trophy, where they made their only appearance at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The U's were easily beaten, losing 4\u20131. Taylor was also unable to prevent relegation to Division Three. He remained in charge until March 2004, with Cambridge United struggling in the bottom half of Division Three, when the club's board terminated his contract and named Frenchman Claude Le Roy as his successor. Le Roy won four of the remaining eight matches and kept United in the league by a comfortable margin.  The following season he made way  for assistant Herv\u00e9 Renard, who in turn lasted just five months before being sacked and replaced by Steve Thompson.
