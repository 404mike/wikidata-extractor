The Premiership side had the best of the opening exchanges and had a great chance to take the lead when Didier Drogba was one-on-one with goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall before Osei Sankofa slid in to take the ball off Drogba's toes as he was winding up the shot. Southend's resistance was broken just passed the half hour mark when Salomon Kalou headed in from a Frank Lampard corner. Drogba could have extended Chelsea's lead before the interval but Steve Mildenhall saved. Peter Clarke nearly drew Southend level with 10 minutes remaining after seeing his header come back off the bar, Clarke was not to be denied a second time and in the 1st minute of injury time a Johnny Herd long throw was directed by Ricardo Carvalho straight into the path of Clarke who headed in the equaliser on his 27th birthday."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Southend United F.C. season", "response": ["| Johnny Herd"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Southend United F.C. season", "response": ["|Johnny Herd"]}]}}
