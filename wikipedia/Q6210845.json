He made his debut for the club on 22 November 1913, in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Leeds City, scoring one of Blackpool's goals. He went on to make a further 25 appearances during the 1913\u201314 campaign, scoring ten more goals.\nThe following season, 1914\u201315, he was an ever-present in Blackpool's 38 league games and one FA Cup tie. He scored 28 goals, including two hat-tricks: one in the second league game of the season, a 3\u20131 victory at Hull City on 5 September 1914, and all of the goals in Blackpool's victory against Glossop at Bloomfield Road on 21 November. Despite Lane's goal haul, Blackpool still only managed a tenth-placed finish after losing almost as many games as they won.\nIn 1915\u201316, World War I intervened, leading to the implementation of regional competitions. Lane served in Egypt with the Hertfordshire Yeomanry during the conflict.\nWhen the Football League resumed in 1919\u201320, with Blackpool's new manager, Bill Norman, in his second season in charge, Lane continued where he had left off, netting 26 goals in 30 league appearances. He scored one hat-trick, in a 6\u20130 whitewash of Lincoln City at Bloomfield Road on 8 September 1919. He left Blackpool with two months of the season remaining, joining Birmingham for a Blackpool club-record fee of \u00a33,600.\nAfter a spell at Millwall, he finished his playing career with Watford Printing when he was in his 40s. He went on to coach at Barcelona for a period.\nLane died in Abbots Langley in February 1959, aged 66.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blackpool F.C.", "response": ["It was a case of as-you-were, however, for the four seasons leading up to the First World War, with finishing positions of 14th, 20th, 16th and 10th.
