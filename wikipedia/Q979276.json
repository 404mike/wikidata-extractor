The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown prior to the 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan. Director Stephen Frears cast him because \"he was in Mary Reilly and I knew he was brilliant.\" Filmed while he was playing Caligula nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, \"It's interesting that in searching for monsters to play, you often end up playing leaders.\" The Daily Telegraph praised his \"earnest, yet steely, portrayal\" while The Guardian found him \"excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting.\" In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV's Dirty Filthy Love, a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette's after a marital separation. Sheen spoke of \"treading a fine line\" because \"a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical\". He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award. Also in 2004, Sheen played a pompous rock star in the romantic comedy Laws of Attraction and produced and starred in The Banker, which won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. In 2005, Sheen starred in the National Theatre's production of The UN Inspector, a David Farr adaptation of The Government Inspector. The Times wrote of \"a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance\" while Variety noted that the actor \"adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire\". The Evening Standard, while conceding that the performance was \"technically brilliant\", expressed bemusement as to why \"one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout\". Also that year, he took part in the Old Vic's 24 Hour Play, in which The Daily Telegraph felt he \"dazzled\". In 2005 film work, Sheen starred in Dead Long Enough, a small-budget Welsh/Irish film, with his longtime friend, Jason Hughes. In addition, he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, made a cameo appearance in The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse and starred in the short film The Open Doors."]}, {"page": "Shooters (2002 film)", "response": ["* Jason Hughes as Charlie Franklin "]}, {"page": "Russell T Davies", "response": ["Because the series was centred on an entire family, Red Productions was given the task of casting eleven principal characters: the role of family patriarch Max Vivaldi was given to Griff Rhys Jones, at the request of ITV for prolific actors; Rhian Morgan, Davies' ex-girlfriend from the WGYT, was cast as Max's wife Val; Sharon Morgan as Max's sister Stella; Joanna Page as Candy Vivaldi; Matthew Barry and Siwan Morris as the Vivaldi siblings Leo and Maria; Hi-de-Hi! actress Ruth Madoc as Val's sister Myrtle Jones; and Jason Hughes as Maria's boyfriend Gethin.
