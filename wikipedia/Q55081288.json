He played in Norwich's opening six league games, getting his second goal for the club in a 4\u20133 defeat against West Bromwich Albion; however, he was then injured in training. During his absence, Klose and Zimmermann established themselves at centre-back, with Ben Godfrey also becoming a regular choice, and Hanley was restricted to a few appearances as substitute on his return. When he finally started a game, an FA Cup tie against Portsmouth, he was sent off in the first fifteen minutes for a professional foul on Ronan Curtis and Norwich went on to lose 1\u20130. Despite his lack of game time, Hanley remained club captain as Norwich gained promotion to the Premier League. In the final game of the season, as Norwich defeated Aston Villa 2\u20131, winning the Championship title, Hanley was brought on as an 89th minute substitute for Onel Hernandez and lifted the Championship trophy alongside team captain Zimmermann."]}, {"page": "FAI International Football Awards", "response": ["|Ronan Curtis"]}, {"page": "V\u00e1clav Hladk\u00fd", "response": ["In August 2020 he joined EFL League Two side Salford City on a two-year contract.

He disappointed manager Kenny Jackett with his performances upon returning to fitness. He was dropped in favour of Ronan Curtis and Ryan Williams, before regaining his first-team spot in December. He finished the 2019\u201320 season strongly, scoring none goals and providing seven assists in 37 games, often making a big impact from the bench; he earned himself praise from Jackett, who said \"he has got a very, very good future ahead of him\".
