They also made their second appearance in the John Player Cup as a result of their County Cup win. Again they conquered higher ranked opposition in the first round when Derby, then of National Division 4 (North), were beaten 10\u20137 in a close encounter at Stanbridge Road (the name Wright's Meadow was still to be coined). The second round draw paired them with first class opposition in the form of nearby Bedford Blues, again at home. Led by John Orwin who was to captain England later that season, and also including former and future Buzzard stalwarts in Pete Ellam and John Davidson, Bedford had to work hard to subdue a spirited Buzzards effort. Buzzards conceded just one try in a 24\u20136 defeat in front of probably the largest crowd to assemble at the ground. Later that season their attempt to land a hat-trick of East Midlands Cup wins was dashed at the last when they fell to Stockwood Park in the final. A fifth place in their first league campaign was a disappointing return for a season that had started with such promise. However this disappointment was tempered slightly by the RFU's decision to expand the entry to the following season's National Cup, now to be called the Pilkington Cup, meaning that Leighton would be included as East Midlands Cup Runners-Up."]}, {"page": "Wibsey", "response": ["* John Orwin, former England Rugby Union captain"]}]}}
