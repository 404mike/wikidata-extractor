She departed in Fallout: Part 5, which aired on 21 September 2012. Helen appeared in three episodes in the main series, as well as three spin-off episodes, which aired on the red button. The red button episodes are an extension of the main episodes. Helen first appears when she poses as a patient to get Elaine Cassidy's (Janet Dibley) side of the story when Elaine's ex-boyfriend, Harrison Kellor (James Larkin), changes his plea for the murder of Lauren Porter (Alexis Peterman). When Elaine asks Helen to leave, she refuses, which leads to Karen Hollins (Jan Pearson) kicking her out. Helen later publishes a story about Elaine's reactions as well as questioning Harrison's ex-wife Fiona (Jenni Keenan Green). Helen approaches Elaine, asking if she read the article. She tries to persuade Elaine to do an interview about Harrison. However, Elaine stills refuses, not wanting anything to do with it. Helen finds a man called Alex Redmond (Stuart Laing) had a wife, Kate, who had an affair with Harrison, and he believes that Harrison killed Kate. Helen phones Alex, wanting an interview about Harrison and his wife Kate. She meets with Alex at his house, asking questions about this. When Helen tells Alex that she knows that Kate did not die but just left Alex, he gets angry, and strangles Helen with a towel. However, she is later found alive at Alex's house."]}, {"page": "World's End (TV series)", "response": ["*Jenni Keenan Green as Moira Campbell, owner of Moira's Cafe and Gregor's Mother"]}]}}
