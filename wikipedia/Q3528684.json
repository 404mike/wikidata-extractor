There was much speculation amongst many established England players as to what changes the new coach would bring to the England setup, particularly one with such close ties to a successful Bath Rugby Club. Rowell claimed he would rid England of the cautious, forward-dominated 10-man game which had done so well for them earlier in the decade, and play running rugby more similar to Bath's. Leonard kept his place in the England team, which now included several new players such as Mike Catt, Ben Clarke, Victor Ubogu, Steve Ojomoh (all Bath players) and Tim Rodber. In the 1995 Five Nations, Leonard won a record (for a prop) 38th cap for England, playing against Scotland, and the victory meant his third Grand Slam."]}, {"page": "David Campese", "response": ["The quarter-finals of the inaugural 1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens took the form of a round-robin tournament with the teams split into two groups. Campese's Australia qualified for Group F which also consisted of South Africa, New Zealand and England. Australia defeated South Africa 7\u20135 in their opening match of the group. Campese was instrumental in Australia's only try of the game. Australian player Jim Fenwicke was driven back in a tackle and he lofted the ball to Campese in support. South African fullback Andr\u00e9 Joubert rushed up and attempted to intercept the floating ball which opened a gap for Campese, who ran from his own quarter and into the South African half. Chester Williams attempted to ankle-tap Campese but missed. Campese attempted to run around Joost van der Westhuizen and occupied him with a goose-step before he passed in-field to John Flett. Flett made a diagonal run toward the posts, but was tackled just before he could score, before he found Matt Burke in support who scored next to the posts. Michael Lynagh converted the try to give Australia a 7\u20130 lead. However, South Africa responded when Andr\u00e9 Joubert scored an unconverted try. The score remained 7-5 and Australia emerged victorious. The Australians then lost their next group game against New Zealand 42\u20130. Australia needed to defeat England in their final group stage to progress to the semi-finals of the tournament. Campese scored in the first minute of the game when he fielded a kick from Nick Beal. Campese beat Beal on the inside and then made a run along the side-line where he avoided an attempted ankle-tap from Matt Dawson, outflanked Tim Rodber and scored the try untouched. Ryan Constable added another try to give Australia a 14\u20130 lead. In the final play before halftime, England's Justyn Cassell scored a try from some loose line-out ball, which Nick Beal failed to convert, giving Australia a 14-5 halftime lead. Dave Scully scored a try for England after picking up a loose ball from \"broken-play\" to reduce Australia's lead to 14\u201312. However, Campese responded by occupying the England number 7 (possibly Damian Hopley) with a goose-step, which created an overlap for Semi Taupeaafe who scored the final try of the game untouched. Australia won the last quarter-final pool game against England 21\u201312.", "Australia narrowly lost the first Rugby Sevens World Cup to England in the final 17\u201321. England player Andy Harriman scored in the first minute of the game when he received the ball in open space and ran around Campese to score under the posts. England raced to a 21\u20130 lead after tries from Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber. Australia responded with tries (unconverted) scored by Michael Lynagh and David Campese. Campese scored his try by goose-stepping past Tim Rodber and chipping the ball over Dave Scully into the in-goal area and falling onto the ball. Semi Taupeaafe scored the final try (converted) for Australia, but they went on to lose the final 17\u201321."]}]}}
