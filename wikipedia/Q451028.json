The Prince song \"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" contains the lyric \u2013 \" 'Oh, my favorite song' she said \u2013 and it was Joni singing 'Help me I think I'm falling' \". \"Lavender\" by Marillion was partly influenced by \"going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell\", according to vocalist and lyricist Fish, and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song \"Montreal\" from Sounds That Can't Be Made. John Mayer makes reference to Mitchell and her Blue album in his song \"Queen of California\", from his 2012 album Born and Raised.
