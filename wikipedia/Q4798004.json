Billitt was the co-presenter and took over the lead role at his own home, Clack's Farm, in Worcestershire, fronting the programme until 1979 when Geoff Hamilton took over. Billitt is regarded as having a very practical style of gardening with large beds and straight rows of vegetables. His work quickly changed the 2.5-acre (10,000 m2) garden into an allotment and national showpiece.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gardeners' World", "response": ["*Arthur Billitt (1976\u20131979)", "*Then Arthur Billitt's Clack's Farm at Ombersley in Worcestershire"]}]}}
