In December 1985 the quartet, now officially the Mighty Lemon Drops, released their first independent single \"Like an Angel\", on Daniel Treacy of Television Personalities' Dreamworld Records label which went to the top of the UK Indie Chart and sold 14,000 copies. They also recorded a session for John Peel around the same time. Becoming part of the C86 movement, which was championed by the New Musical Express, they were soon snapped up by Geoff Travis of Rough Trade for his new Blue Guitar label, a subsidiary of Chrysalis Records.  They signed with Sire Records for the United States and Canada around the same period. Derek Jarman produced the video for the \"Out of Hand\" single in 1987 which was followed by their hit \"Inside Out\" in 1988. In the UK, albums Happy Head and World Without End both charted (#58 and #33 respectively). In the US, World Without End was a number one Modern Rock/College album in 1988 and Happy Head was one of the 50 best albums of the year 1986 according to Sounds magazine critics poll. These two albums relied heavily on Newton's use of a vintage Vox Mark VII semi-acoustic \"Teardrop\" 12-string electric guitar and a Micro-Frets Spacetone 6-string guitar. The band eventually parted company with Chrysalis in the UK after three albums (Happy Head, World Without End and Laughter), failing to repeat their initial independent success, but remained signed with Sire in the US, with Laughter, another US Modern Rock No.\u00a01 entering the lower regions of the Billboard 200 in 1990.
