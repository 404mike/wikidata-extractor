Most obviously, it reunited producer Verity Lambert with Head of Television Drama Sydney Newman. Together they had been at the core of decision-makers who launched Doctor Who. But the series also brought Donald Cotton, who had the same year written two serials for Doctor Who, back into Newman's orbit. Cotton and partner Richard Harris would write the first script, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", and would thus come to be credited as co-creators.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0505194/fullcredits IMDB's crew sheet for the series' pilot.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/517661/index.html The British Film Institute's page on Adam Adamant Lives!.

In truth, he is probably more correctly seen as the executive producer or as having \"developed the series for television\". Adam Adamant Lives! was a quick replacement for the show he had actually intended, an adaptation of the adventures of literary detective Sexton Blake. When the rights to the character suddenly became unavailable, it fell to writers Donald Cotton and Richard Harris, along with script editor Tony Williamson, to come up with a replacement idea.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/522017/index.html BFI article on Sydney Newman. Newman indicated near the end of his life that he had, indeed, been significantly involved in the rewrites, suggesting that his critic Mary Whitehouse had been partial inspiration for the character. Like Doctor Who which had preceded it, Adam Adamant Lives! was thus a show created somewhat by committee and circumstance. Many of the indoor scenes were filmed at Studios 3 and 5 at the BBC Television Centre in London."]}, {"page": "Phaethon", "response": ["* Donald Cotton wrote a comedy radio play 'The Tragedy of Phaethon' broadcast on BBC Network 3 on 10 February 1965.BBC Genome"]}, {"page": "Cressida", "response": ["In \"The Myth Makers\", a 1965 storyline by  Donald Cotton in the time-travel\u2013based British science fiction television series Doctor Who, the character Vicki (played by Maureen O'Brien), a teenaged travelling companion of the Doctor, meets Priam, King of Troy who, disliking her name, dubs her Cressida.

It is there that the Clanton brothers hang out for most of the story, ready to shoot either The Doctor (mistaken for Doc Holliday) or Steven or Dodo. The Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon is the musical piece that is heard at various places through the serial, underscoring the threat and humour of the story. However, the sale of alcohol wasn't restricted anywhere close to Tombstone, and indeed the area's booming mining economy at the time of The Gunfighters, made saloons a vital part of the economy. Two of the first saloons in Tombstone were the Crystal Palace and the Oriental, and they provide an interesting template on which to judge the accuracy of the Gunfighters saloon. In the serial, music is shown as being provided by a stand-up piano and a single, female singer of dubious repute. In reality, the Oriental and Crystal Palace (along with the approximately 50 other saloons in business at the time of Gunfighters) were styled after more staid British saloons, providing patrons with classical music, rendered by the city's brass band or visiting chamber artists. Saloons in prosperous Tombstone were further more or less restricted to men only, and were also casinos. Thus, as with other historical details surrounding The Gunfighters, writer Donald Cotton was far off the historical mark with his \"Last Chance Saloon\"."]}, {"page": "Shane Rimmer", "response": ["In 1989, Rimmer was reunited with Bishop and Zimmerman during the production of a BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet.
