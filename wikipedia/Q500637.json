He would later credit the time spent in his childhood walking and cycling around the district for the development of his keen interest in geography.In 1951 he entered undergraduate studies at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read Geography. Peter Hall (later Sir Peter), the noted urban geographer, was one of his contemporaries. Haggett graduated in 1954, obtaining a \"Double First\" (First-Class Honours in parts I and II of the Tripos).In an academic career spanning half a century, Professor Haggett is noted for his significant research contributions to the field of human geography, and is the author or editor of over 30 books on geographical practice, theory and individual research topics. He has held numerous teaching posts and visiting professorships at institutions around the world, but is most particularly associated with the University of Bristol where he has been a lecturer and professor of geography since 1966. Among the many awards and distinguished recognitions conferred, Haggett was awarded the French Laur\u00e9at Prix International de G\u00e9ographie Vautrin Lud in 1991, and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1993, for \"services to urban and regional geography\".\nPeter is also known to have been offered many prestigious academic positions, but has preferred to specialize in the geographical study of epidemiology and the spatial relationships and distribution of infectious diseases for the latter half of his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Human geography", "response": ["By the 1960s, however, the quantitative revolution led to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor in an overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from its two subfields of physical and human geography and from geology, geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical models in order to solve spatial problems. Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of geographic information systems; the use of statistics, spatial modeling, and positivist approaches are still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are Fred K. Schaefer, Waldo Tobler, William Garrison, Peter Haggett, Richard J. Chorley, William Bunge, and Torsten H\u00e4gerstrand."]}, {"page": "Bridgwater", "response": ["*Peter Haggett CBE FBA (b. 1933), academic geographer and professor at University of Bristol, was educated at Dr Morgan's Grammar School, Bridgwater."]}, {"page": "Economic geography", "response": ["Fred K. Schaefer's article \"Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination\", published in the American journal Annals of the Association of American Geographers, and his critique of regionalism, made a large impact on the field: the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, and quantitative methods began to prevail in research.

Roots of this work were visible while he was at Cambridge: the Department of Geography also housed Richard Chorley, and Peter Haggett. His Explanation in Geography (1969) was a landmark text in the methodology and philosophy of geography, applying principles drawn from the philosophy of science in general to the field of geographical knowledge. But after its publication Harvey moved on again, to become concerned with issues of social injustice and the nature of the capitalist system itself. He has never returned to embrace the arguments made in Explanation, but still he conforms to the critique of absolute space and exceptionalism in geography of the regional-historical tradition that he saw as an outcome of Kantian synthetic a priori knowledge."]}, {"page": "History of geography", "response": ["The quantitative revolution in geography began in the 1950s.
