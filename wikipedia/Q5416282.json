Anderson (1909\u20131977), was a journalist in the UK. Born Lore Seligmann on 13 May 1909 to a German Jewish family, she joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) while a student in Frankfurt in 1927. She abandoned the KPD two years later over its sectarian attacks on the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), and subsequently joined a small left-wing SPD fraction, the Leninist Organisation, later known as Neu Beginnen. After Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, she left Germany for Great Britain, where she and her husband Paul Anderson (1908\u20131972) became members of the small group of socialist exiles from Nazi Germany in Britain that included Julius Braunthal and Franz Borkenau.\nHer long article \"The Underground Struggle in Germany\", published under the pseudonym Evelyn Lend, occupied nearly the whole of an issue of Fact, edited by Raymond Postgate, in 1938. She revisited the subject in Hammer or Anvil?: the Story of the German Working Class Movement, which George Orwell\u2019s wife Eileen helped to edit and Orwell reviewed in the Manchester Evening News.\nThe couple worked for British black propaganda radio station, Sender der Europ\u00e4ischen Revolution which broadcast news and anti-Nazi propaganda to Germany between 1940 and 1942. She joined the left-wing weekly, newspaper Tribune in 1943 as assistant editor, covering foreign affairs. She became a close friend of Orwell when he joined the paper later the same year, and her strong antipathy to communism played a major role in determining the paper\u2019s political stance in the late 1940s, although she was considered obsessive about eastern Europe by some members of staff. She was joint editor of the Tribune from 1946 to 1952, sharing the job first with Jon Kimche and then with Michael Foot. She later collaborated with the historian Walter Laqueur on a political dictionary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tribune (magazine)", "response": ["Kimche left Tribune to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by Frederic Mullally. After the Labour landslide election victory of 1945, Bevan joined Clement Attlee's government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and Evelyn Anderson as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, Tribune was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the Sunday Pictorial) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.", "#Frederic Mullally and Evelyn Anderson (1945\u20131946)", "#Jon Kimche and Evelyn Anderson (1946\u20131948)", "#Michael Foot and Evelyn Anderson (1948\u20131952)"]}, {"page": "Lore Seligmann", "response": ["#redirect Evelyn Anderson"]}, {"page": "Evelyn N.
