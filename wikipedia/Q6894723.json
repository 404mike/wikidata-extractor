She is probably best known for her collaboration with the electronica group Saint Etienne on the Neil Young cover \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" (which went Top 40 in the UK and to No 1 in the US Hot Dance charts).\nLambert began singing, playing acoustic guitar and song-writing as a child in Africa, largely influenced by the Celtic folk songs her parents taught her. While at school in the UK she became a fan of the British indie scene, enjoying acts like The Smiths and The Cure, later exploring vintage records by artists like Sandy Denny, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. She is also a fan of avant-garde cinema.\nLambert studied at the Conservatory of Music, played in coffee bars, and worked with Spanish cellist, pianist and composer Dan Anies, who co-wrote two of the songs on her first solo album 'Coming Up Roses' (released October 2006).\nPolygram gave Lambert a publishing deal and UK independent label Big Cat Records signed her as a teenager. She stayed there, touring the UK with Lush and Slowdive and Europe with fellow label mates Jeff Buckley and Heather Nova (whose first recording Lambert contributed backing vocals to) until the label was bought out by V2 Records in 1996.\nAfter co-writing the top 20 UK chart hit, \"Skin on Skin\", with Paul Oakenfold for his Grace project, Lambert formed Ova, releasing a 3 track single, Universal Audio on UK independent label Global Warming. Since Ova broke up in January 2000, Lambert has collaborated with Freeloader and Data, two obscure electronica collectives staying well in the vein of trip hop, and contributed backing vocals to Tram's album, A Kind of Closure, released on UK's Jet Set Records.\nLambert relocated to  Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, in 2002. Following the release of her first solo album in 2006, Lambert wrote and performed the theme music for a Chum Television documentary 'Survival of the Fittest: Stories from the West Coast Trail' with Fox. She released the album 'Climbing Mountains In The Night' in 2008.\nLambert then collaborated on an album of club mixes with composer Luke Parkin, also produced by Fox. Her music is eclectic, ranging from folky to stylized pop.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saint Etienne (band)", "response": ["Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs were childhood friends and former music journalists, who once had a fanzine called Caff which had developed into a record label by 1989.

However, after working with Sarah Cracknell on \"Nothing Can Stop Us\", they decided to make her the permanent vocalist, and Cracknell has written or co-written many of the band's songs."]}, {"page": "Travel Edition 1990\u20132005", "response": ["* Moira Lambert - Vocals on \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\""]}, {"page": "Sarah Cracknell", "response": ["Saint Etienne was originally to be an indie dance act featuring various vocalists.  After Moira Lambert sang on their initial 1990 single \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and Donna Savage was heard on the follow-up single \"Kiss and Make Up,\" Cracknell lent her vocals to \"Nothing Can Stop Us\" and ended up doing the rest of the singing on their debut album Foxbase Alpha.

The vocals are by Moira Lambert (Sarah Cracknell had not yet joined the band as a permanent member). The band recorded the song in producer Ian Catt's bedroom studio in Pollards Hill. The recording, made in under two hours, got them a record deal, their first single, and their first hit. Andrew Weatherall later remixed the song, further emphasising its dub bassline: this remix, subtitled \"A Mix of Two Halves\" (duration 8:49), was featured on both releases of the single and on the compilation Casino Classics. The U.S. and European releases contained a different extended mix by Flowered Up (duration 6:19), issued in the UK only on a flexidisc, though it was mistakenly listed as the \"Mix of Two Halves\". Weatherall had no involvement with this mix."]}, {"page": "Kiss and Make Up (Saint Etienne song)", "response": ["Saint Etienne were \"drinking buddies\" with Michael Hiscock from The Field Mice.
