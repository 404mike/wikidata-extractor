Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became a whirlwind of activity. He ordered the creation of the X Corps, which contained all armoured divisions, to fight alongside his XXX Corps, which was all infantry divisions. This arrangement differed from the German Panzer Corps: one of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one corps commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all-infantry and all-armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. Correlli Barnett commented that Montgomery's solution \"...\u00a0was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further.\" Montgomery reinforced the  long front line at El Alamein, something that would take two months to accomplish. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions (51st Highland and 44th Home Counties) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order to better coordinate combined operations.", "Historian Correlli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000 prisoners of war were taken, including the German second-in-command, General von Thoma, as well as eight other general officers. Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany at the start of the battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after Stumme\u2014his replacement as German commander\u2014died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle."]}, {"page": "Battle of Ramillies", "response": ["The total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day. David G. Chandler's Marlborough as Military Commander and A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe are consistent with regards to French casualty figures i.e., 12,000 dead and wounded plus some 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles, also notes 12,000 dead and wounded and states 'up to 10,000' taken prisoner. In The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History, Dupuy puts Villeroi's dead and wounded at 8,000, with a further 7,000 captured. Neil Litten, using French archives, suggests 7,000 killed and wounded and 6,000 captured, with a further 2,000 choosing to desert. John Millner's memoirs \u2013 Compendious Journal (1733) \u2013 is more specific, recording 12,087 of Villeroi's army were killed or wounded, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In Marlborough, however, Correlli Barnett puts the total casualty figure as high as 30,000 \u2013 15,000 dead and wounded with an additional 15,000 taken captive. Trevelyan estimates Villeroi's casualties at 13,000, but adds, 'his losses by desertion may have doubled that number'. La Colonie omits a casualty figure in his Chronicles of an old Campaigner; but Saint-Simon in his Memoirs states 4,000 killed, adding 'many others were wounded and many important persons were taken prisoner'.

His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland; his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees.  To estrange Italy, one of the Locarno powers, over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Laval's Auvergnat peasant mind\".Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power (London: Methuen, 1972), p. 353.\"Laval... was very reluctant to lose the fruits of his diplomacy, the separation of Italy and Germany, for such trivial reasons...

In June 1935, he became Prime Minister as well.  In October 1935, Laval and British foreign minister Samuel Hoare proposed a realpolitik solution to the Abyssinia Crisis.  When leaked to the media in December, the Hoare\u2013Laval Pact was widely denounced as appeasement of Mussolini.James C.

Of  battalions which attacked on 1 July,  into no man's land, ten rushed the German front line from the British front trench and only twelve advanced at a steady pace. The slow advances of some of the twelve battalions took place behind a creeping barrage and were the most successful attacks of the day. Prior and Wilson wrote that the deciding factor in the success of British infantry battalions was the destructive effect of British artillery; if German gunners and machine-gun crews survived the bombardment, no infantry tactic could overcome their firepower."]}, {"page": "Corelli", "response": ["* Correlli Barnett (1927- ), historian "]}, {"page": "Corelli Barnett", "response": ["#redirect Correlli Barnett"]}, {"page": "Thomas Jones (civil servant)", "response": ["His biographer, Dr E.

He also regarded the League of Nations Mandates over Danzig, with Polish ownership of a German-populated city, as a 'house of cards that would not stand'.   Crowe was sceptical of the usefulness of the League of Nations and in a memorandum of 12 October 1916, he said that a solemn league would be like other treaties, and asked: \"What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?\" Crowe was also sceptical on whether the pledge of common action against breakers of the peace would be honoured. Crowe thought that the balance of power and the considerations of national interest would determine how individual states decided their future actions. Crowe argued that boycotts and blockades, as advocated by the League of Nations, would not be of any use: \"It is all a question of real military preponderance\" in numbers, cohesion, efficiency and geographical location of each state. Universal disarmament, Crowe also argued, would be a practical impossibility.Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power (Pan, 2002), p. 245."]}, {"page": "Sir Horace Rumbold, 9th Baronet", "response": ["[Hitler] starts with the assumption that man is a fighting animal; therefore the nation is a fighting unit, being a community of fighters....
