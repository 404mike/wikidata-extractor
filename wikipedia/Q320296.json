He was succeeded in the other titles by his younger brother William Wellesley-Pole, 1st Baron Maryborough, who became the third Earl of Mornington. He was also a politician and notably served as Chief Secretary for Ireland between 1809 and 1812 and as Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer between 1811 and 1812. Born William Wesley, he assumed by Royal licence in 1781 the additional surname of Pole on succeeding to the estates of his cousin, William Pole. In 1798 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Wellesley-Pole in lieu of Wesley-Pole. In 1821 he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Maryborough, of Maryborough in the Queen's County. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He married Catherine, daughter and coheir of Sir James Tylney-Long, 7th Baronet (see Tylney-Long Baronets). She was known in London society as \"The Wiltshire heiress\" and was believed to be the richest commoner in England. On his marriage he assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Tylney and Long. Lord Mornington is chiefly remembered for his dissipated lifestyle which brought about the destruction of the Tylney family estate of Wanstead House. He was succeeded by his eldest and only surviving son, the fifth Earl. He had been the subject of a bitter custody battle between his father and his two maternal aunts (who had wanted him to be placed under the guardianship of his great-uncle the Duke of Wellington) and later fought a legal battle with his father over the sale of contents of the family seat Draycot House. Lord Mornington died unmarried in 1863 when the barony of Maryborough became extinct. He left all his landed property to his father's cousin Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley. He was succeeded in his Irish titles by his first cousin once removed, Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington. The title Earl of Mornington is now used as a courtesy title by the heir apparent to the Marquess of Douro, himself the heir apparent to the Duke of Wellington. As of 2015 the title is held by courtesy by Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, son of Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Douro and grandson of Charles Wellesley, 9th Duke of Wellington."]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington"]}, {"page": "Lord Charles Wellesley", "response": ["When his older brother, Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington, died in 1884 with no heirs, Lord Charles's second child, Henry Wellesley (as the oldest surviving son) inherited his uncle's dukedom as Duke of Wellington.

Ordinal suffixes such as \"III\" are generally reserved for monarchs; however, the General Register Office has stated that, whereas it would normally reject a string of symbols or letters that \"has no intrinsic sense of being a name\" when registering a child, a suffix such as \"III\" would be accepted. Those who inherit a title of nobility do not use ordinal suffixes, but are distinguished from any ancestors with the same name by their position in the order of succession; for example Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington, is thus distinguished from his father, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington."]}, {"page": "Brighton railway station", "response": ["Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington, died at the station on 13 August 1884."]}, {"page": "Arthur Richard Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington"]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex", "response": ["*Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington 28 May 1868 \u2013 13 August 1884"]}]}}
