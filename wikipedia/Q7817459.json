Sandars then repeated the announcement and all stations then took a special BBC News programme presented by Evan Davis. The all-network simulcast continued until 4pm, when both Radio 1 and 1Xtra switched to a mix of instrumental music and regular announcements. Radios 2 and 3 broke away an hour later, and began playing easy listening and classical music respectively for the rest of the evening. Commercial radio networks had varying responses to the news - LBC broke the news at the time the official announcement was published; the rest of the Global networks, including Capital, Heart and Smooth, first broke the news in a special bulletin at 12:15pm. The Bauer Radio networks, such as Absolute Radio, Greatest Hits Radio, Hits Radio and Jazz FM, waited until 12:30pm to announce the news. Following the initial announcement, all commercial music stations suspended advertisements and continuously played easy listening songs with frequent announcements briefly informing listeners of the news."]}]}}
