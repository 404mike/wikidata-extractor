Savill was a right-handed batsman whose bowling style is unknown.  He was born in Brentwood, Essex.\nSavill made his first-class debut for Essex against Glamorgan in the 1953 County Championship.  He played first-class cricket for Essex more from 1953 to 1961, making 125 appearances, with his final appearance coming against Surrey.  In his 125 appearances for the county, he scored 3,919 runs at a batting average of 21.29, with fifteen half centuries, four centuries and a high score of 115.  His highest first-class score came against Cambridge University in 1959.  Savill passed 1,000 runs for a season once, in 1959 when he scored 1,197 runs at an average of 32.35.  His only first-class wicket was George Dews, who he dismissed for 130 when Essex played Worcestershire in 1959.  His only bowling innings, which consisted of 2 overs was expensive, costing 26 runs.Following the end of his first-class career, he played a single Minor Counties Championship match for Devon in 1964 against Berkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1935 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Les Savill, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Dickie Dodds", "response": ["Dodds' first-class cricket career never achieved these heights again, and though he continued to contribute more than 1000 runs each season for the next 10 years, his batting average drifted downwards \u2013 to the low 30s up to 1952, and then the mid 20s thereafter. His cavalier batting style rarely led to long innings and he never scored more than three centuries in any single season; after 1954, he made only one further century in four-and-a-half years of regular county cricket. He was, according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002, \"like a fiery Viking, smiting and walloping in the Essex cause\". In the wet 1958 season his aggregate was just 1075 runs and his average had declined to 21.93; he was, with Dennis Brookes and Jack Robertson, by this stage one of only three cricketers to have achieved 1000 runs in each postwar season. In the 1959 season, the young opening batsman Les Savill enjoyed a highly successful start to the season and Dodds dropped out of the Essex first team in mid-season. After a few second eleven games, he did not regain his place and he retired from regular cricket at the end of the season. He reappeared in single matches for MCC in both 1960 and 1961, in the first of these scoring 75 and 41 against Cambridge University and sharing a fast opening partnership of 100 with Tom Pugh that lasted just an hour."]}, {"page": "Savill (surname)", "response": ["*Les Savill (born 1935), English cricketer"]}]}}
