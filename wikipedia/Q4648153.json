M. W. Stirling credits them as the anonymous authors of a 1909 publication of automatic writings \u2014 communications with spirit beings \u2014 titled The Result of an Experiment. The introduction to this book describes the couple as practicing automatic writing together every night for many years of their marriage. Since precious little primary material in Evelyn De Morgan\u2019s own hand has survived, this text provides important information on her faith and her approach to a range of issues, from her understanding of ultimate reality to her belief about the role of art in capturing spirit. From the moment that de Morgan encountered spiritualism, her perspective seemed to change, and her works started to reflect more ideas about darkness and death.\u00a0 De Morgan uses a range of motifs to represent spiritual ideas. A few examples are Renaissance angels, heavenly auras, a distinctive contrast between light and dark, and the symbolic use of colours.\u00a0 De Morgan uses complex allegories to depict her social commentary and spiritual beliefs. And the iconography in these works reflect several spiritual themes such as the progress of the spirit, the materialism of life on earth, and the imprisonment of the soul in the earthly body. \u00a0"]}, {"page": "Kempshott", "response": ["A.
