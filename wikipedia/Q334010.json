In the context of finite groups, this aim leads to difficult mathematics. According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order p, a prime number, are necessarily cyclic groups \\mathrm{Z}_p and hence also abelian. Groups of order p^2 can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order p^3, as the non-abelian group \\mathrm{D}_4 of order 8=2^3 above shows.. See also  for similar results. Computer algebra systems can be used to list small groups, but there is no classification of all finite groups. An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups. A nontrivial group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself. The Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups. Listing all finite simple groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. 1998 Fields Medal winner Richard Borcherds succeeded in proving the monstrous moonshine conjectures, a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple sporadic group (the \"monster group\") and certain modular functions, a piece of classical complex analysis, and string theory, a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena."]}, {"page": "November 29", "response": ["*1959 \u2013 Richard Borcherds, South African-English mathematician and academic"]}, {"page": "String theory", "response": ["In 1992, Richard Borcherds constructed a bridge between the theory of modular functions and finite groups and, in the process, explained the observations of McKay and Thompson.Gannon, p. 8 Borcherds' work used ideas from string theory in an essential way, extending earlier results of Igor Frenkel, James Lepowsky, and Arne Meurman, who had realized the monster group as the symmetries of a particular version of string theory.
