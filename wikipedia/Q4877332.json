He released two albums on Dandelion \u2013 Beau (1969) and Creation (1971) (which featured Jim Milne and Steve Clayton from Tractor as backing musicians on some tracks), plus the single \"1917 Revolution\" which had greater success abroad than it did in the United Kingdom. \"1917 Revolution\" is said to have been the inspiration for America's \"A Horse with No Name\".\nHis best known song however is probably \"The Roses of Eyam\" (written under the name of John Trevor) which folk singer Roy Bailey took around the world and which he recorded on his Hard Times LP in 1985. This version was subsequently re-released on Bailey's Past Masters CD in 1998. Beau himself released the song officially for the first time as a bonus track on the 2007 British reissue of the original Beau disc (Cherry Red), and on the 2008 Japanese release of the same album (Airmail Recordings).\nA CD of eighteen previously unissued songs \u2013 Edge of the Dark \u2013 was issued on the Angel Air label in 2009, followed in 2011 by the Cherry Red download albums The Way It Was and Creation Recreated. The latter was a remastered, partially remixed and much expanded version of 1971's Creation. Beau also contributed a previously unreleased song \u2013 In The Court of Conscience \u2013 to vinyl specialist Fruits de Mer Records' 2012 Annual, and a 180gram vinyl version of The Way It Was was issued by Ritual Echo Records in 2012.\nA download album \u2013 Fables & Fa\u00e7ades \u2013 was also released in 2012 on the Cherry Red label. An unusual departure, this was made up of eighteen mostly full-band arrangements recorded between 1978 and 2000.\nBeau has produced several hundred songs - newly recorded albums continue to be released by Cherry Red for both download and streaming - and he has also recorded under the names of John Trevor, Trevor Midgley and Simfonica. Though mostly known as a \"folk\" performer, his writing has also been strongly influenced by blues and rock. He co-wrote \"WARHOL \u2013 The Musical\" with Steve Clayton of the band Tractor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Peel", "response": ["In 1969 Peel founded Dandelion Records (named after his pet hamster) so he could release the debut album by Bridget St John, which he also produced.
