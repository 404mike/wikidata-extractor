After 16 years as a country parson, he served as Bishop of Calcutta until his death at the age of 42. The son of a rich landowner and cleric, Heber gained fame at the University of Oxford as a poet. After graduation he made an extended tour of Scandinavia, Russia and Central Europe. Ordained in 1807, he took over his father's old parish, Hodnet, Shropshire. He also wrote hymns and general literature, including a study of the works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor.\nHe was consecrated Bishop of Calcutta in October 1823. He travelled widely and worked to improve the spiritual and general living conditions of his flock. Arduous duties, a hostile climate and poor health led to his collapse and death after less than three years in India. Memorials were erected there and in St Paul's Cathedral, London. A collection of his hymns appeared soon after his death.  \"Holy, Holy, Holy!

Watts led the change in practice by including new poetry for \"original songs of Christian experience\" to be used in worship, according to Marini.  The older tradition was based on the poetry of the Bible: the Psalms.  According to LeFebvre, Psalms had been sung by God's people from the time of King David, who with a large staff over many years assembled the complete book of Psalms in a form appropriate for singing (by the Levites, during Temple sacrifices at the time).  The practice of singing Psalms in worship was continued by Biblical command in the New Testament Church from its beginnings in Acts through the time of Watts, as documented by Prutow.  The teachings of 16th-century Reformation leaders such as John Calvin, who translated the Psalms in the vernacular for congregational singing, followed this historic worship practice.  Watts was not the first Protestant to promote the singing of hymns; however, his prolific hymn writing helped usher in a new era of English worship as many other poets followed in his path. lists hymn writers who followed in the tradition established by Watts, including  Charles Wesley, Edward Perronet, Ann Steele, Samuel Stennet, Augustus Toplady, John Newton, William Cowper, Reginald Heber, Samuel Davies, Timothy Dwight, John Leland, and Peter Cartwright."]}, {"page": "1826 in music", "response": ["*April 3 \u2013 Reginald Heber, hymn-writing bishop (b. 1783)"]}, {"page": "Heber", "response": ["* Reginald Heber, Anglican bishop, missionary to India, and author"]}, {"page": "Whitchurch, Shropshire", "response": ["* Reginald Heber (1783\u20131826), Rector of Hodnet and Bishop of Calcutta attended Whitchurch Grammar School"]}, {"page": "List of Christmas carols", "response": ["|written by Reginald Heber"]}, {"page": "Le Morte d'Arthur", "response": ["* Malory's book inspired Reginald Heber's unfinished poem Morte D'Arthur.
