On 26 December 2002, at 16 years and 356 days, he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League, with a goal in a 2\u20131 win against Sunderland. His record was broken by James Vaughan of Everton in 2005. In a match against Chelsea two days later, Milner scored again, with a deft first touch of the ball and manoeuvre, in order to avoid a tackle from Chelsea defender Marcel Desailly. The manoeuvre created a yard of space for him to deliver a curling shot from . Reporters were impressed by his overall performance in the match, especially by his desire, confidence, and ability with both feet. Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri remarked after the match that Milner had performed like a much more experienced player. The performance prompted comparisons to England internationals Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney, who had also come to footballing prominence as teenagers."]}, {"page": "Manchester City F.C.", "response": ["|Head of Academy || Jason Wilcox"]}, {"page": "Ray Harford", "response": ["1995\u201396 was a frustrating season for Harford and Blackburn.

Despite an early exit from the 1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League, Blackburn improved as the season went on. Although they never looked like regaining their Premiership title, they were in contention for a UEFA Cup place until the last game of the season but lost out to Arsenal and finished seventh. It wasn't at all a bad finish, though, considering that Blackburn had been in the bottom half of the Premier League for much of the season. During the summer of 1996, Alan Shearer was sold to Newcastle United for a then world record fee of \u00a315\u00a0million, and Harford failed to adequately replace him.

The match was played at Ewood Park; the opposition, Everton, received the same treatment as previous visitors, leaving home on the back of a 3\u20130 defeat. Shearer got the first after 17 minutes, latching onto Tim Flowers' clearance before running at the Everton defence and shooting in the bottom left corner. Shearer was the provider for the second just before half time, crossing to the back post for an unmarked Jason Wilcox to blast home, and it was Shearer again who made sure of the points in the 60th minute, converting a penalty after Sutton had been brought down. The match is notable for being the first game to feature Everton's new signing Daniel Amokachi of Nigeria, the first black player at the club in over 20 years. As the score reflected, Amokachi proved no match for the Blackburn defence who seemed to tackle him very easily and he did not threaten goal in the entire match.", "Blackburn's title challenge continued to stutter in the next match with a 1\u20131 away to leaders Newcastle United. Rovers took the lead through a 57th-minute penalty from Shearer after Wilcox had been brought down by Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek. Blackburn looked to be leaving with all three points, but Newcastle scrambled an equaliser just two minutes from time: Colin Hendry unintentionally flicked on Scott Sellars' corner and the ball fell to Steve Howey. His shot was cleared off the line by Jason Wilcox, only to rebound into the net off the back of Tim Flowers.", "Things didn't get any easier for Blackburn as they then faced an away trip to Nottingham Forest, who were unbeaten and had a 24-game unbeaten record in all competitions. In a hard fought, entertaining competitive match, Blackburn came out 2\u20130 victors. Sutton gave Blackburn the lead in the eighth minute, capitalising on Forest's failure to clear the ball on the edge of their area by thumping a right-foot shot on the turn.
