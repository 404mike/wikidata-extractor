Retiring from this work, he emigrated to Australia, where he continued to collect insects and studied marine natural history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ornithology", "response": ["The search for patterns in the variations of birds was attempted by many. Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775\u20131854), his student Johann Baptist von Spix (1781\u20131826), and several others believed that a hidden and innate mathematical order existed in the forms of birds. They believed that a \"natural\" classification was available and superior to \"artificial\" ones. A particularly popular idea was the Quinarian system popularised by Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785\u20131840), William Sharp Macleay (1792\u20131865), William Swainson, and others. The idea was that nature followed a \"rule of five\" with five groups nested hierarchically. Some had attempted a rule of four, but Johann Jakob Kaup (1803\u20131873) insisted that the number five was special, noting that other natural entities such as the senses also came in fives. He followed this idea and demonstrated his view of the order within the crow family. Where he failed to find five genera, he left a blank insisting that a new genus would be found to fill these gaps. These ideas were replaced by more complex \"maps\" of affinities in works by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alfred Russel Wallace. A major advance was made by Max F\u00fcrbringer in 1888, who established a comprehensive phylogeny of birds based on anatomy, morphology, distribution, and biology. This was developed further by Hans Gadow and others."]}, {"page": "William John Swainson", "response": ["In 1819 William Sharp Macleay had published his ideas of the Quinarian system of biological classification, and Swainson soon became a noted and outspoken proponent. The Quinarian System fell out of favour, giving way to the rising popularity of the geographical theory of Hugh Edwin Strickland. Swainson was overworked by Dionysius Lardner, the publisher of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia and both Swainson and Macleay were derided for their support of the Quinarian system. Both proponents left Britain; Swainson emigrated to New Zealand and Macleay to Australia. An American visiting Australasia in the 1850s heard to his surprise that both Macleay and Swainson were living there, and imagined that they had been exiled to the Antipodes 'for the great crime of burdening zoology with a false though much laboured theory which has thrown so much confusion into the subject of its classification and philosophical study'.D.

He assisted his father in writing The Natural Arrangement of British Plants (1821). After being blackballed by the Linnean Society of London, Gray shifted his interest from botany to zoology. He began his zoological career by volunteering to collect insects for the British Museum at age 15. He officially joined the Zoological Department in 1824 to help John George Children catalog the reptile collection. In some of his early articles, Gray adopted William Sharp Macleay's quinarian system for classifications of molluscs (1824), butterflies (1824), echinoderms (1825), reptiles (1825), and mammals (1825).  In 1840, he took over Children's position as keeper of zoology, which he held for 35 years, publishing well over 1,000 papers. He named many cetacean species, genera, subfamilies, and families."]}, {"page": "Edward Blyth", "response": ["In 1911, H.M. Vickers considered Blyth's writings as an early understanding of natural selection which was noted in a 1959 paper, where Loren Eiseley claimed that \"the leading tenets of Darwin's work \u2013 the struggle for existence, variation, natural selection and sexual selection \u2013 are all fully expressed in Blyth's paper of 1835\". He also cited a number of rare words, similarities of phrasing, and the use of similar examples, which he regarded as evidence of Darwin's debt to Blyth. However, the subsequent discovery of Darwin's notebooks has \"permitted the refutation of Eiseley's claims\". Eiseley argued that Blyth's influence on Darwin \"begins to be discernible in the Darwin Note-book of 1836 with the curious word 'inosculate'. It is a word which has never had a wide circulation, and which is not to be found in Darwin's vocabulary before this time.\" This was incorrect: an 1832 letter written by Darwin commented that William Sharp Macleay \"never imagined such an inosculating creature\". The letter preceded Blyth's publication, and indicates that both Darwin and Blyth had independently taken the term from Macleay whose Quinarian system of classification had been popular for a time after its first publication in 1819\u20131820. In a mystical scheme this grouped separately created genera in \"osculating\" (kissing) circles."]}, {"page": "Cirrhitidae", "response": ["The Cirrhitidae were first recognised as a family by the Scots-born Australian naturalist William Sharp Macleay in 1841. It is one of the 5 constituent families in the superfamily Cirrhitoidea which is classified in the suborder Percoidei of the order Perciformes. Within the Cirrhitoidea, the Cirrhitidae is probably the most basal family. They have been placed in the order Centrarchiformes by some authorities, as part of the superfamily Cirrhitoidea, however, the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise the Centrarchiformes. The name of the family is taken from that of the genus Cirrhitus which is derived from cirrhus meaning a \"lock of hair\" or \"a barbel\", thought to be a reference to lower, unbranched rays of the pectoral fins which Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de termed as \u201cbarbillons\u201d, which means \"barbels\"  in his description of the type species of the genus C. maculatus, and which he thought to be \u201cfalse\u201d pectoral fins. Another possibility is that the name name refers to cirri extending from the tips of the spines in the dorsal fin spines, although Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de did not mention this feature."]}, {"page": "Thomas Horsfield", "response": ["On returning to London, Horsfield continued to be in contact with Sir Stamford Raffles and became a keeper of the museum of the East India Company on Leadenhall Street, London, working under Charles Wilkins.

He was influenced by William Sharp Macleay and his quinarian system of classification. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of London (1828) and a fellow of the Linnean Society (1820), later becoming a vice president. In 1828, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. Horsfield was appointed assistant secretary of the Zoological Society of London at its formation in 1826.

Alexander and Eliza moved, bitterly, to Brownlow Hill. He was elected Speaker of the Legislative Council (1843\u201346). Injured in a carriage accident in 1846, and still suffering the effects, he died at Tivoli, Rose Bay, the home of one of his daughters.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly (1856\u201374), a trustee of the Australian Museum (1861\u201377), and in 1862 helped found the Entomological Society of NSW. In 1865 he inherited the insect collections of Alexander and W. S. Macleay and leased Elizabeth Bay House, living there with his wife Susan. William John, like the Macleays who had lived in the house before him, was an ardent collector, sponsoring collecting expeditions including that of the \"Chevert\" to New Guinea in 1875, and broadening the collection from insects and marine invertebrates to encompass all branches of the natural sciences (such as birds and reptiles). Encouraging the study of botany, he was the first president of the Linnean Society of NSW (1874).
