On lap 44, the technical director of the Williams team Patrick Head went to his outfit's gantry on the pit wall to instruct Ralf Schumacher to enter the pit lane earlier than scheduled. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop for tyres on the next lap and rejoined the circuit in second place, three seconds behind Montoya, who assumed the lead. Montoya increased his pace to hold a five-second advantage when he entered the pit lane for his second scheduled stop on the 50th lap. He emerged in fourth position, ahead of Ralf Schumacher as Michael Schumacher returned to the lead. Montoya pulled off to the side of the track with smoke bellowing from his engine on lap 53, ending his race. Barrichello entered the pit lane for his third and final stop on the next lap. It took 7.7 seconds and he emerged in third position. On lap 56, Irvine stopped on the grass at the right-hand side of the Adelaide hairpin with a pneumatic valve system failure."]}, {"page": "2001 German Grand Prix", "response": ["Montoya admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having been leading until his only pit stop on lap 22. He stated: \"I am so disappointed I cannot find the words to describe how I feel. Up to the pit stop the race was going perfectly for me.\" Williams technical director Patrick Head was not happy with the refueling rigs supplied by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). One of the rigs was sent back to manufacturer Intertechnique who said they could not find any issues with the system. Michael Schumacher, placed fourth before his retirement from a fuel pressure problem on lap 23, shared similar feelings to Montoya: \"I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race to go. It was a shame not to finish the race and pick up a further six points.\""]}, {"page": "1988 Formula One World Championship", "response": ["Mansell's race was helped when the 'reactive suspension' used on the Williams FW12 was dumped by the team after Friday qualifying and a conventional suspension was put in its place. Team Technical Director Patrick Head called the work \"a bit of a bodge\", but the new suspension transformed the car and allowed Mansell and teammate Riccardo Patrese to enter the race with confidence for the first time all season (after Friday qualifying, Patrese had been 30th and last, almost 21 seconds slower than provisional pole man Alboreto)."]}, {"page": "1986 Formula One World Championship", "response": ["Shortly before the season began, Frank Williams was involved in a road accident in France that left him in a wheelchair.

Williams also had exclusive use of the  Honda V6 turbo engine for the entire season after having only run it in the last race of 1983 in South Africa.

Horsley upgraded the 308 to the 308D and continued as Hesketh Racing. Harald Ertl signed to drive the car, with the team's image landing Penthouse Magazine and Rizla as sponsors. Guy Edwards joined in a second car from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards with Alex Ribeiro bringing in some funds later in the year. Ertl's seventh place at the British Grand Prix was the team's best result of the year. Future Williams engineer Patrick Head noted that the 308D had significant aerodynamic issues at the rear of the car which hindered performance."]}, {"page": "Adrian Newey", "response": ["Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, Williams F1 was a top running team, and technical director Patrick Head wasted no time in getting a contract signed. With a vastly superior budget, drivers and resources at his disposal, Newey and Head rapidly became the dominant design partnership of the early 1990s. By mid-season 1991, Newey's FW14 chassis was every bit a match for the previously dominant McLaren, but early season reliability issues and the efforts of Ayrton Senna prevented Williams team leader Nigel Mansell from taking the title."]}, {"page": "Neil Oatley", "response": ["Born in Britain, Oatley graduated from Loughborough University in 1976 with an automotive engineering degree. He worked briefly outside motor racing before joining the Williams team in 1977.  There he became one of many young engineers to have worked alongside Patrick Head early in their careers before moving on to other organisations.  Oatley worked as a draughtsman before becoming a race engineer for both Clay Regazzoni and Carlos Reutemann."]}]}}
