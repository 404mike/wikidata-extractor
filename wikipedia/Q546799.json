However, with the arrival of Sol Bamba, he found his playing time increasingly limited. With speculation that Leicester would sign Chelsea defender Jeffrey Bruma on loan, new manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson said that Hobbs could join another club. He joined Leicester's fellow Championship club Hull City on 15 February 2011 on loan for the rest of the 2010\u201311 season. He made his debut a week later in a 1\u20130 away win against Derby County. Failing to break into the team due to competition from James Chester and Anthony Gerrard, Hobbs expressed his desire to return to Leicester once the loan spell ended. Nevertheless, he made 13 appearances for Hull during his loan spell.", "After Hull City were promoted to the Premier League, the club informed Hobbs that he was no longer required. In July 2013, Sky Sports reported that Championship club Nottingham Forest were interested in signing him.

He scored his first goal on 28 September in a 1\u20130 home victory over Derby County, heading in an Andy Reid corner before half-time. On 24 January 2014, Hull recalled him because of an injury to defender James Chester. However, on 31 January, Hobbs signed permanently for Nottingham Forest on a four-and-a-half-year contract, for a fee reported by Sky Sports to be worth \"close to \u00a31million\".

O'Neill won his first match in charge of Stoke, 4\u20132 away at Barnsley on 9 November. Stoke began to improve and secured vital victories over Wigan Athletic, Luton Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield Town, helping the team move out of the relegation zone at the turn of the year. In the January transfer window O'Neill cancelled the loans of Cameron Carter-Vickers, Mark Duffy and Scott Hogan, whilst also letting Peter Etebo, Badou Ndiaye and Ryan Woods leave on loan. Into the team came Northern Irish midfielder Jordan Thompson from Blackpool, center-back James Chester on loan from Aston Villa and young midfielder Tashan Oakley-Boothe from Tottenham Hotspur. Stoke beat Hull City 5\u20131 on 7 March 2020 moving the team three points above the drop with nine remaining matches. The Championship was suspended on 13 March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Due to the ongoing pandemic the 2020\u201321 season began later in September with matches continuing to played behind closed doors. O'Neill brought in a number of free transfers including James Chester, Morgan Fox, Steven Fletcher and Mikel John Obi with Jacob Brown the only arrival to have been bought. Stoke began the season well with Tyrese Campbell in decent form, winning eight of their first 16 matches and were just outside the play-off places at the beginning of December. However a number of injuries to key players most notably to Tyrese Campbell saw goals dry up and the team went nine games without a win at the turn of the year. Stoke were unable to put a sustained run of results together in March and April and ended the season in mid-table."]}, {"page": "Tommy Elphick", "response": ["Ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, Elphick was appointed as the club's new captain. It came after when Birmingham Mail urged the club to appoint Elphick as the new captain, due to his inspiration towards his teammates and the way he connects well with the club's supporters. Elphick made his Aston Villa debut (as well as captain), in the opening game of the season, in a 1\u20130 loss against Sheffield Wednesday. He then scored an own goal, in a 1\u20131 draw against Newcastle United on 24 September 2016. He quickly established himself in the first team for the first two months until he suffered an injury in mid-October. After returning from injury, Elphick continued to regain his place in the first team until he was dropped from the first team by new Manager Steve Bruce in mid-December. Because of this, he was among several players up for sale in the winter transfer window, in order to reduce the wage bills. Although the move never happened, he remained on the substitute bench for the rest of the season, as Bruce preferred the central-defensive partnership of Nathan Baker and James Chester, who also took his place as the captain as well, and mostly came on as a late substitute. Despite this, Elphick went on to make the total of 26 appearances in his first season at Aston Villa."]}, {"page": "Manchester United F.C.

This led Thompson to begin playing football for a local team \"as a way of integrating\". In 1998, he joined Manchester United's youth team and played alongside James Chester, Danny Drinkwater and Tom Cleverley. At school, Thompson said\" that football slowly turned him from an outsider into one of the gang\" and that he had an air of arrogance and confidence in any situation, as he was good at something but his teachers warned him that he still needed to concentrate on his studies in case he \"might not make it\"; it didn't stop him from \"practising his signature on scraps of paper at the back of the classroom\". Thompson said life was great for him until at age 16, he learned that Manchester United released him because he was small. Thompson said his release was difficult to take that he didn't tell any of my friends for at least two weeks, stating: \"I'd always been a winner \u2013 the best at football, athletics and basketball \u2013 but now I was a loser.\""]}]}}
