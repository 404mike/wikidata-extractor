It was deleted as \"pseudonym\" by an editor who said \"wasn't a pen name\". The definition in the template documentation is \"Any of the person's aliases or pen names.\" Is that intended to include an alternative real name as in this case? What's the definition of an alias or a pen name? The article in question is Adelaide Phillpotts who wrote her later works as Adelaide Ross after a late marriage. I'm sure she's not the only woman to whom this applies, and there are of course also men who change their name legally at some point in their life. Pinging  as the editor who removed this name.
