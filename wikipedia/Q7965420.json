He followed his father, working as a coalminer. After some time playing for Mexborough, he moved to play for Doncaster Rovers in 1887 at around the age of 19 where, being an amateur, he worked as a slotting machinist at the GWR railworks. Langton started off in the left back position, moving to centre forward in the 1890\u221291 season, then latterly returning to left back.He scored at least 55 goals in his career at Doncaster - in his early days many goals weren't accredited to a player in the records. The first recorded goals were a brace on 9 February 1889 in a 2\u22122 draw against Newark. In his next season Langton scored at least 14 out of the 34 matches that the team played, including 5 against Newark in an 8\u22120 victory on 1 February 1890. In 1890\u221291 it was 11 goals out of the 19 games Rovers played.On 5 November 1898, he scored against Huddersfield in the Yorkshire League in the still standing joint record 14\u22120 Doncaster win.Langton was the only recorded scorer of penalties for Rovers up till 1898. The first one recorded was in a 3\u22123 draw against Sheffield Strollers in front of a crowd of 6,000 in the Sheffield and Hallamshire Challenge Cup on 18 February 1893 at the Olive Grove, Sheffield. In all he is listed as having scored 8 goals from the spot.After the 1904\u221205 season with Doncaster, Langton retired from playing the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Langton", "response": ["Walter Langton (died 1321) of Castle Ashby'Parishes: Castle Ashby', in A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 4, ed.

The life of Langton was strongly influenced by his uncle William Langton (d. 1279), Archbishop of York-elect, by Robert Burnell, Lord Chancellor of England and then by the years in which he served King Edward I. Lichfield Cathedral was improved and enriched at his expense.", "His origins were long unclear but following recent research (Hughes, 1992) it is now apparent that he was the eldest son of Simon PeverelJill Hughes, Episcopate of Walter Langton, Bishop of Coventry & Lichfield, 1296\u20131321 (Ph.D. thesis 1992)[Vol. 1: http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11108/1/315105_vol1.pdf][Vol. 2: http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11108/2/315105_VOL2.pdf] \"Langton's register clarifies the bishop's connections with the Peverel family of Leicestershire and Northamptonshire and shows that he was a Peverel by birth. Copies of charters preserved in his register, by which Langton granted land and the advowson of the church of Adlingfleet, Yorks., to Selby abbey, clearly state his paternity; Langton names himself as the son and heir of Simon Peverel (Reference: Bishop Langton's Register, nos. 1291, 1292, 1293)...\"(Bishop] Langton's mother, Amicia Peverel, was buried at Langton (Leicestershire)\" Quoted in \"C.P.

It may be supposed through his duties in York he became a friend of William Langton and through the two men, Walter Langton was introduced to the King. The King must have liked the young man, for he selected him for his service and in later years Langton became \"unquestionably Edwards's first minister and almost his only real confidant\".", "Having become unpopular, the barons in 1301 vainly asked Edward to dismiss Langton; about the same time he was accused of murder, adultery and simony. Suspended from his office, he went to Rome to be tried before Pope Boniface VIII, who referred the case to Winchelsea, archbishop of Canterbury; the archbishop, although Langton's lifelong enemy, found him innocent, and this sentence was confirmed by Pope Boniface in 1303. Little is said about the nature of the charges of witchcraft against Bishop Walter Langton.See  Julien Th\u00e9ry-Astruc, \"'Exc\u00e8s' et 'affaires d\u2019enqu\u00eate'.
