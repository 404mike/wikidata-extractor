At the age of 39, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for action while his unit was attempting to bridge the Sambre\u2013Oise Canal. Archibald received his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace in May 1919. From his citation:\n\nOn 4 November 1918 near Ors, France, Sapper Archibald was with a party building a floating bridge across the canal. He was foremost in the work under a very heavy artillery barrage and machine-gun fire. The latter was directed at him from a few yards distance while he was working on the cork floats. Nevertheless he persevered in his task and his example and efforts were such that the bridge which was essential to the success of the operations was very quickly completed. Immediately afterwards Sapper Archibald collapsed from gas poisoning.", "link_mentions": {}}}
