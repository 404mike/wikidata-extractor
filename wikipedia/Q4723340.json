He studied with Engelbert Humperdinck in Berlin.\nIn 1910, he conducted Oscar Straus's The Chocolate Soldier, which he toured in England.  He was said to be the youngest operatic conductor in England.  He composed for and participated in wartime charity concerts.  In 1920-21, Reynolds toured the Far East with the Royal Opera.  On his return he wrote the music for Baroness Orczy's play, Leatherface.  Reynolds worked on the revival of 18th century ballad operas.\nIn 1923 he became Musical Director of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, where he performed revivals of  Sheridan's The Duenna (1924), Lionel And Clarissa (1925), with music mainly by Charles Dibdin, and Love in a Village (1928), with music by Thomas Arne.  He wrote incidental music for several plays, including those by Moli\u00e8re, Farquhar, Shakespeare and Goldsmith, and review music for Nigel Playfair. The Lyric staged Reynolds's comic operas The Fountain of Youth and Derby Day.\nReynolds left the Lyric in 1932 for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.  He wrote 1066 And All That (a musical based on the comic book by of that name) and a score for The Swiss Family Robinson.\nIn 1947, he wrote music for a Stratford-upon-Avon adaptation of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.  A two-act comic opera, The Limpet in the Castle, was premiered in 1958 at Wombwell, Yorkshire.\nMuch of his theatre music has been played in the concert hall.\nReynolds died aged 84 at Bognor Regis on 18 October 1969.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1066 and All That", "response": ["In 1935, the musical comedy 1066\u00a0\u2013 and all that: A Musical Comedy based on that Memorable History by Sellar and Yeatman was produced.

Another overture inspired by the play is Alfred Reynolds' The Taming of the Shrew Overture (1927). Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's verismo opera Sly, ovvero la leggenda del dormiente risvegliato (1927) focuses on the Induction, with libretto by Giovacchino Forzano. A tragedy, the opera depicts Sly as a hard-drinking and debt-ridden poet who sings in a London pub. When he is tricked into believing that he is a lord, his life improves, but upon learning it is a ruse, he mistakenly concludes the woman he loves (Dolly) only told him she loved him as part of the ruse. In despair, he kills himself by cutting his wrists, with Dolly arriving too late to save him. Starring Aureliano Pertile and Mercedes Llopart, it was first performed at La Scala in Milan. Rudolf Karel's The Taming of the Shrew is an unfinished opera upon which he worked between 1942 and 1944. Philip Greeley Clapp's The Taming of the Shrew (1948) was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera. Vittorio Giannini's The Taming of the Shrew (1953) is an opera buffa, with libretto by Giannini and Dorothy Fee. It was first performed at the Cincinnati Music Hall, starring Dorothy Short and Robert Kircher. Vissarion Shebalin's Ukroshchenye stroptivoy (1957), with libretto by Abram Akimovich Gozenpud, was Shebalin's last opera and was immediately hailed as a masterpiece throughout Russia. Dominick Argento's Christopher Sly (1962), with libretto by John Manlove, is a comic opera in two scenes and an interlude, first performed in the University of Minnesota. Sly is duped by a Lord into believing that he himself is a lord. However, he soon becomes aware of the ruse, and when left alone, he flees with the Lord's valuables and his two mistresses."]}, {"page": "1884 in music", "response": ["*date unknown \u2013 Alfred Reynolds, English composer (d. 1969)"]}, {"page": "A.

A notable revival occurred at the Lyric Hammersmith in London in 1928, using an adaptation by Alfred Reynolds. The opera was first published in 1763, but without recitative or librettos. A copy of the full score, which is partly in the composer\u2019s hand, also survives and is in the collection of the library at the Royal College of Music. Most of the music displays a simple and lyrical nature with the exception of the music for Rosetta.
