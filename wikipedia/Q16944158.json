Johan Ernst Gunnerus first described the species as Cetorhinus maximus, from a specimen found in Norway, naming it. The genus name Cetorhinus comes from the Greek ketos, meaning \"marine monster\" or \"whale\", and rhinos, meaning \"nose\". The species name maximus is from Latin and means \"greatest\". Following its initial description, more attempts at naming included: Squalus isodus, in 1819 by Italian Zoologist Saverio Macri (1754\u20131848);  Squalus elephas, by Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1822; Squalus rashleighanus, by Jonathan Couch in 1838; Squalus cetaceus, by Laurens Theodorus Gronovius in 1854; Cetorhinus blainvillei by the Portuguese biologist Felix Antonio de Brito Capello (1828\u20131879) in 1869; Selachus pennantii, by Charles John Cornish in 1885; Cetorhinus maximus infanuncula, by the Dutch Zoologists Antonius Boudewijn Deinse (1885\u20131965) and Marcus Jan Adriani (1929\u20131995) in 1953; and Cetorhinus maximus normani, by Siccardi in 1961. Other common names include bone shark, elephant shark, sail-fish, and sun-fish. In Orkney, it is commonly known as hoe-mother (sometimes contracted to homer), meaning \"the mother of the pickled dog-fish\".Yarrell, William. (1836). A History of British Fishes. Volume II.

Water-tube boilers already existed, and Thornycroft built the river-steamer Peace in 1882 with that type of boilers, of the Herreshoff design. In 1885 his improved system was ready, and it became one of the most important of the 50\u201360 patents he obtained between 1873 and 1924. Built with the new boilers, the Spanish Ariete reached  on trials in 1887, and in 1894 the yard delivered the torpedo gunboat HMS Speedy to the Royal Navy, which was the first ship with water-tube boilers in that Navy. Should anybody wonder why Charles John Cornish took a break from his usual descriptions of wildlife and delved into maritime technology, it would perhaps be helpful to know that he was in fact married to John Thornycroft's daughter, Edith."]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Charles John Cornish (1858\u20131906), English naturalist and author"]}, {"page": "Cornish (surname)", "response": ["*Charles John Cornish (1858-1906), English naturalist and author"]}, {"page": "Vaughan Cornish", "response": ["He was the son of the vicar of Debenham, Charles John Cornish (1834-1913) and Anne Charlotte Cornish (1831-1887).
