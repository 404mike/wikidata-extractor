Lied's diary mentions a meeting with Arthur Balfour on March 5, 1918, and with  Robert Cecil on March 6, later also with Reginald Hall (head of MI6) and Michael Romanov (the tsar's cousin exiled in London). It is not clear if Lied initiated the plan himself or if he was merely invited by the British help with logistics. According to Anthony Summers, Lloyd George hesitated because he wanted to improve relations with the new regime in Russia, while king George insisted that his relatives should be rescued.Summers, Anthony (1978).

In an attempt to capture some of the company's assets he travelled via Vladivostok to Omsk in 1919 and had meetings with the leader of the counter-revolution Alexander Kolchak. In May 1919 Lied was commissioned by Kolchak to negotiate with Winston Churchill (then UK defence minister) about supplies to Kolchak's Siberia, the plan was not implemented."]}, {"page": "Guybon Chesney Castell Damant", "response": ["In 1918, Damant was reassigned under the Naval Intelligence Division headed by Rear Admiral Reginald Hall to lead a team of covert divers to enter and remove intelligence materials from freshly sunken U-boats.
