John Watts decided not to contest the Slough seat at 1997 General Election due to unfavourable boundary changes and contested Reading East where the sitting Conservative MP was retiring; however, he was defeated in Reading East by Jane Griffiths in 1997.\nWatts died in September 2016 at the age of 69.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Watts"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Watts"]}, {"page": "John Watts", "response": ["John Watts may refer to:", "*John Watts (1715\u20131789), Member of the New York General Assembly", "*John Watts (New York politician) (1749\u20131836), U.S. Representative from New York", "**Statue of John Watts, an 1893 outdoor bronze sculpture", "*John Watts (Australian politician) (1821\u20131902), Queensland politician", "*John Watts (British politician) (1947\u20132016), British MP from Slough", "*John Watts (Stoke politician) (1864\u20131951), British political activist and mine rescue hero", "*John Watts (Grenadian politician) (1921/22-2015), Grenada MP", "*John Watts (athlete) (born 1939), British Olympic athlete", "*John Watts (jockey) (1860\u20131902), British jockey", "*John Watts (judoka) (born 1944), British judoka", "*John Watts (military architect) (1786\u20131873), British military officer and colonial architect in New South Wales", "*John Watts de Peyster (1821\u20131907), author on the art of war, philanthropist; early Adjutant General of the New York National Guard", "*John Watts de Peyster Jr. (1841\u20131873), Union Army officer during the American Civil War", "*John Watts (British Army officer) (1930\u20132003), British general", "*John Watts (merchant) (died 1616), English merchant and shipowner", "*John Watts (Royal Navy officer) (1755\u20131801), midshipman on James Cook's third voyage to the Pacific", "*John Watts (Cherokee chief) (died 1802), also known as \"Young Tassel\"", "*John Watts (sailor) (c. 1778\u20131823), U.S. merchant captain from Virginia", "*John Watts (reformer) (1818\u20131887), English educational and social reformer", "*John Watts (composer) (1929\u20131982), American composer", "*John Watts (singer) (born 1954), British singer/guitarist and member of Fischer-Z", "*John Watts (historian), late medieval historian"]}, {"page": "Slough (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|John Watts || Conservative"]}, {"page": "Minister of State for Transport", "response": ["| John Watts"]}, {"page": "John Arthur Watts", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Watts (British politician)"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John Watts, 69, politician, MP for Slough (1983\u20131997)."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 2010s", "response": ["|John Watts"]}, {"page": "Second Major ministry", "response": ["| John Watts"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2016", "response": ["*John Watts, 69, British politician, MP for Slough (1983\u20131997).John Watts, robustly Right-wing MP \u2013 obituary"]}, {"page": "List of MPs who lost their seat in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Watts"]}]}}
