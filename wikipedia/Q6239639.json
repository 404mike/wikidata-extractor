Born in Croydon, South London and educated at the County School at Beckenham in Kent and the University of Oxford (New College), he served in the Royal Artillery and Intelligence during the Second World War and then pursued an academic career.   He was a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford from 1946\u201360 and of Queens' College, Cambridge from 1955\u201382, becoming a Life Fellow on his retirement.  He held a post as lecturer in English at Aberdeen University (1949\u201354), and then moved to the University of Cambridge, where he was successively Lecturer in English (1954\u201366), Reader (1966-72), and Professor of Modern English (1972\u201382).  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1956.  Holloway gave the 1958 Chatterton Lecture on Poetry.  From 1961-63 he served as Byron Professor at the University of Athens.  As Chairman of the Department of English at Cambridge (1970\u201371), he initiated an important broadening of the undergraduate literature curriculum, in particular to include American literature.  He was married twice, in 1946 to Audrey Gooding with whom he had a son and daughter, and in 1978 to Joan Black.  He died in Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King Lear", "response": ["Among those who argue that Lear is redeemed in the Christian sense through suffering are A.C. Bradley and John Reibetanz, who has written: \"through his sufferings, Lear has won an enlightened soul\". Other critics who find no evidence of redemption and emphasise the horrors of the final act include John Holloway and Marvin Rosenberg. William R. Elton stresses the pre-Christian setting of the play, writing that, \"Lear fulfills the criteria for pagan behavior in life,\" falling \"into total blasphemy at the moment of his irredeemable loss\". This is related to the way some sources cite that at the end of the narrative, King Lear raged against heaven before eventually dying in despair with the death of Cordelia."]}, {"page": "The Movement (literature)", "response": ["The Movement produced two anthologies, Poets of the 1950s (edited by D. J. Enright, published in Japan, 1955) and New Lines (edited by Robert Conquest, 1956). Conquest, who edited the New Lines anthology, described the connection between the poets as \"little more than a negative determination to avoid bad principles\". These 'bad principles' are usually described as \"excess\", both in terms of theme and stylistic devices. Poets in New Lines included Enright, Conquest, Kingsley Amis, Donald Davie, Thom Gunn, John Holloway, Elizabeth Jennings, Philip Larkin and John Wain."]}, {"page": "New Poets of England and America", "response": ["Kingsley Amis - William Bell - Robert Bly - Philip Booth - Edgar Bowers - Charles Causley - Henri Coulette - Donald Davie - Catherine Davis - Keith Douglas - Donald Finkel - W.
