This was a response to an earlier note Cooper had received from the United States Air Force, telling him that Air Force personnel would not play computer games whilst on active duty.", "Upon developing \"Heroes\" into a two part episode, the part of Agent Richard Woolsey was conceived by Cooper to fill the episode out. The producers were made aware that Robert Picardo was already in Vancouver working on an episode of The Dead Zone and he was offered the role. As Picardo was scheduled to fly to UK, all of his work was condensed into a single day of filming at The Bridge Studios. Picardo described that characters role as being sent to \"investigate whether or not heads should roll\", determining whether or not there was a lapse in judgement and if anyone is to blame following a tragic event. Another character who was added after the episode was redeveloped into a two-part story was Colonel Dave Dixon of SG-13, who was portrayed by Adam Baldwin. Baldwin filmed his parts in late May 2003. Baldwin's performance impressed the producers so much that he was considered for a supporting role in spin-off Stargate Atlantis. David Lewis portrays Cameron Balinsky, another member of SG-13. Reoccurring guests include Ronny Cox, Bill Dow, Dan Shea and Gary Jones as Senator Kinsey, Dr. Lee, Sgt. Siler and Walter respectively."]}, {"page": "Zero Hour (Stargate SG-1)", "response": ["\"Zero Hour\" features several guest stars. Los Angeles actor David Kaufman was brought in to play the part of Mark Gilmor,   a red herring to the story. Cliff Simon, flown in from L.A. for a day's work, filmed most of his scenes as Ba'al against green-screen in the gateroom for a \"hologram feel\". Bill Dow (Dr. Lee) was doing theater work in Vancouver during the filming of this episode, necessitating the producers to schedule around his availability. Gary Jones's character, an SG-1 semi-regular technician who sported the name \"Norman Davis\" on his uniform for years, received a new name in this episode: \"Walter Harriman\". After O'Neill had referred to him as \"Walter\" in the Season 4 episode \"2010\", the producers could not get clearance for a renaming into \"Walter Davis\". The new name is based on General Hammond referring to Jones's character as \"Airman\" (sounding like \"Harriman\") in the pilot episode, and SG-1 writer Joseph Mallozzi explained the resulting incongruity as a married-name issue. One scene in \"Zero Hour\" features Pierre Bernard, a graphic designer for the NBC show Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as technician O'Brien. The SG-1 producers saw Bernard ranting on Late Night about Stargate SG-1 being better without Daniel Jackson (actor Michael Shanks was not part of SG-1 during Season 6), and gave him a cameo spot."]}, {"page": "Fallen (Stargate SG-1)", "response": ["George Touliatos portrays Shamda, the leader of the nomad people who inhabit the ancient city on Vis Uban, with Raahul Singh playing one of his people, Khordib.

Martin Wood specifically wanted to cast someone in the position of Yu's first prime who wasn't as tall and physically imposing as some of the previous First Prime's, particularly in contrast to Christopher Judge who he would share the majority of his scenes with.
