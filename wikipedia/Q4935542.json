They went up as runners-up in the Third Division in 1980 and, save for one season in League One in 2017\u201318, have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. A second successive promotion was nearly achieved the following year, but the club missed out on goal difference, and promotion-winning manager Howard Kendall moved to Everton that summer. Kendall's successor, Bobby Saxton only managed mid-table finishes for the next three seasons, then nearly achieved promotion in the 1984\u201385 season, but a poor finish the following year (just one place above relegation) followed by an abysmal start to the 1986\u201387 season cost Saxton his job."]}, {"page": "Exeter City F.C.", "response": ["In the 1963\u201364 season, City achieved their first ever promotion, going up to Division Three.

With his new club sitting in the relegation zone already, second bottom of the Championship table, Keane chose to enforce changes quickly. His first actions as manager were deciding to keep the existing assistant manager, Bobby Saxton, and to appoint his former Nottingham Forest colleague Tony Loughlan as head coach. He wasted no time in bringing in new additions to the squad, with a total of six players signing on the final day of the August transfer window. The most notable signings were Keane's former Manchester United teammates Dwight Yorke and Liam Miller, supported by former Celtic colleagues Ross Wallace and Stanislav Varga,"]}, {"page": "List of Plymouth Argyle F.C. managers", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|Danes (2009), Complete Record, p. 133.\"Bobby Saxton's managerial career\".
