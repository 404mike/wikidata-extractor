Additionally, Catley participated in several projects as a guest vocalist, the first of which was Jabberwocky by Oliver Wakeman and Clive Nolan in early-1999. Catley disagreed with Hard Rain's musical drift away from the classical Magnum sound, and soon became more focused on his solo career. In September 1999 he decided to quit Hard Rain, marking the end of a working relationship with Clarkin that dated back to 1972. Clarkin briefly continued Hard Rain with Sue McCloskey replacing Catley as lead vocalist. They performed with this lineup at a charity event in January 2000, but Hard Rain never released any additional new material.

It was not long before the idea of a one disc album was dropped since Hughes ended up having written 28 songs, so it was decided to divide them into two albums \u2013 one containing the heavier material, and one that would contain the ballads. Additionally, the initial idea was to mix the album in the US, so many renowned guitarists were considered for the guitarist position, including Doug Aldrich, Lanny Cordola and Ralph Santolla. However, when it was decided to lay down the guitar parts in England, the name of the guitarist Vinny Burns (Dare, Ultravox) was brought up. The name was quite familiar to Hughes, since they both knew each other from quite a few years back. Given the fact that Mike Stone was assigned to mix the albums, the project quickly evolved into a band situation, thus marking the first official incarnation of Ten. During the first year of the band's existence, another ex-Dare member joined the band when Greg Morgan was brought in to fill in for the drummer position.", "In 1999, the band returned to the studio in order to begin the recordings of their next album.

The album featured members Gary Hughes, John Halliwell, Paul Hodson and session musicians Neil Fraser on lead guitar, Mark Sumner on bass and Mark Zonder (Fates Warning) on drums and was produced by Dennis Ward. A month later, an unreleased song from the Babylon sessions named \"Dawn Star\" appeared, as part of the AhORa Rock podcast of the Rocktopia music site. Originally, \"Dawn Star\" was meant to be included on the Babylon album, but was removed from it just three weeks prior to its final release. In January 2011, it was announced that the band would also be filming a video for the new album, with Devin Dehaven as the director. \"Endless Symphony\" was the highest budget video to date for the band and it was released just a month after.
