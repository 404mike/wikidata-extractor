He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. On the formation of a Conservative government after the 1979 general election, Lord Lyell was made a House of Lords whip, serving until 1984. He was then moved to the Northern Ireland Office as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State where he remained until he left the government in 1989.\nWith the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, Lord Lyell along with almost all other hereditary peers lost his automatic right to sit in the House of Lords. He was however elected as one of the 92 elected hereditary peers to remain in the House of Lords pending completion of House of Lords reform.\nHe was a supporter of Everton Football Club and a shareholder. He said \n\n\"I have been a great supporter, all round the world, of Everton Football Club. I am 200 miles from there now and 300 miles away when I am in Scotland. But thanks to the BBC World Service, when I have been in, for example, Seattle or elsewhere around the world, great happiness, or perhaps sometimes sadness, has been caused by Everton's results. I declare an interest also in that I am a shareholder.\"\nHowever, his true football love was Forfar Athletic F.C.  He was Honorary Patron of the Angus League Two side and had been a supporter since a young age. He was a regular visitor to Station Park, always sponsoring the last home game of the season.\nHe died on 11 January 2017. At that time, he was the third longest serving member of the House of Lords, after Lord Carrington and Lord Denham. The barony became extinct on his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Politics of Scotland", "response": ["In 2015, twelve of the 92 hereditary peers with seats in the House of Lords to which they are elected (from among themselves) under the House of Lords Act 1999 were registered as living in Scotland, as were 49 life peers appointed under the Life Peerages Act 1958, including five former Lords Advocate.
