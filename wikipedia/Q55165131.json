Darrell Figgis, the vice-chairman became acting Chair. The committee produced three draft texts, designated A, B and C. A was signed by Figgis, James McNeill and John O'Byrne. B was signed by James G. Douglas, C.J. France and Hugh Kennedy and it differed substantially from A only in proposals regarding the Executive.Douglas p81 This difference was intended by Douglas to permit the anti-treaty faction a say in the final proposed constitution before its submission to the British Government. As such it was, according to Douglas, an attempt to ameliorate the pro- and anti-treaty split. Draft C was the most novel of the three. It was signed by Alfred O'Rahilly and James Murnaghan, and provided for the possibility of representation for the people of the northern counties in the D\u00e1il in the event of that area opting out of the proposed free state.Douglas p85 The Irish text was then drafted as a translation of the English text. The Irish language version was drafted by a committee which included the Minister for Education, Eoin MacNeill; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy speaker), P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille; the Clerk of the D\u00e1il, Colm \u00d3 Murchadha; Piaras B\u00e9asla\u00ed; Liam \u00d3 Rinn and Professors Osborn Bergin and T.

Justice Kevin Dixon duly did so, recusing himself because in 1942, before being made a judge, he had assisted the then Attorney General in the case. \u00d3 Caoimh was taken aback when Gavan Duffy rejected the application on the ground that Section 10 of the act violated the Constitution of Ireland, in two ways: it violated the separation of powers, in that the legislature was attempting to prevent the judiciary hearing a case as provided under Articles 34 to 37 of the Constitution;[1950] 1 I.R. pp.70, 84 and it violated Article 43's protection of private property, by requisitioning the funds without sufficient cause.[1950] 1 I.R. 83 \u00d3 Caoimh argued that s.5 of the Erasmus Smith Schools Act 1938 and s.1(1) of the Accidental Fires Act 1943 similarly restricted legal proceedings; Gavan Duffy responded that the 1938 act was made by mutual agreement between the litigants, and that he would regard the 1943 provision as likewise unconstitutional.  Judgment was not reserved; instead Gavan Duffy immediately read out a ruling he had written the day before hearing.  On 23 June, the Attorney General's appeal was heard in the Supreme Court, before justices James Murnaghan, James Geoghegan, John O'Byrne, William Black and Martin Maguire, with senior counsel John A. Costello and Se\u00e1n MacBride appearing for Sinn F\u00e9in.[1950] 1 I.R. pp.71,74 Conor Maguire recused himself because of his prior involvement in the legislative process. The Supreme Court's judgment, delivered by O'Byrne on 31 July 1947, upheld both grounds of the High Court ruling.[1950] 1 I.R. 67\u201368 Although the constitution prohibits the publication of dissenting opinions, Gerard Hogan states that William Black may have disagreed with the verdict."]}, {"page": "Murnaghan, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Murnaghan"]}]}}
