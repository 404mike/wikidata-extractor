He also wrote many non-fiction books, numerous magazine articles, short stories, and poetry. He is best known as the co-author of the book The Peter Principle with Laurence J. Peter. He is also known for the saying \"He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away.\"\nHe studied creative writing at the University of British Columbia at the age 30 after discovering he had an aptitude for the craft. After graduation, he eventually began writing television screenplays for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He later branched into writing for the stage and in time formed The Gastown Players.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter principle", "response": ["The concept was explained in the 1969 book The Peter Principle (William Morrow and Company) by Peter and Raymond Hull.

The \"Peter Principle\" is therefore expressed as: \"In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.\" This leads to Peter's Corollary: \"In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties.\" Hull calls the study of how hierarchies work \"hierarchiology.\"Peter, Laurence J., and Raymond Hull.
