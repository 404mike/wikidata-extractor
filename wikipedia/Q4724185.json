At the beginning of the 20th century these issues were once again brought to the forefront. In 1903 an inquiry was set up at the instructions of Arthur Balfour, soon to be Prime Minister. The committee of inquiry was to consist of eight members, Sir Algernon West was made chairman. They were tasked to investigate \"the constitution, duties and administration of the Heralds' College\". The main issues being the anomalous position of the College, who are theoretically officials of the Royal Household, but actually derive their income from fees paid by private individuals for their services. Some of the members of the committee (a minority) wanted (like Burke thirty-four years earlier) to make officers of the College of Arms into \"salaried civil servants of the state\". Despite concluding that some form of change was necessary, the inquiry categorically stated that any changes \"is at the present time and in present circumstances impracticable.\" In 1905 the generous endowment from the Crown (as instituted by George IV) was stopped by the Liberal Government of the day as part of its campaign against the House of Lords and the class system."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1837\u20131901)", "response": ["*Sir Algernon West (1832\u20131921)"]}, {"page": "Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom", "response": ["| Algernon West", "| Sir Algernon West "]}, {"page": "Normandy, Surrey", "response": ["In the south of the parish, touching an arm of Normandy village and all of Flexford (another clustered development), stands Wanborough railway station, so-called because the owner of the land, diplomat and civil servant Algernon West lived in Wanborough  south.
