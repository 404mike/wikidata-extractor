They ran onto the pitch and play was delayed for a few minutes while order was restored. According to Philip Gibbons, Bury's 4\u20130 win was a \"football lesson\" for the Southampton players. Even so, The Guardian said in its report on Monday morning that Robinson was \"undoubtedly the hero of the match\". The report says he made several outstanding saves and, without him, Southampton would have suffered a massive defeat. On the Bury side, the Guardian reporter praised McLuckie for putting in \"some fine play\", especially when he scored his second goal. The report says that Sagar and Plant were always dangerous in attack and Tommy Davidson was the best of the Bury defenders.", "|LB || Tommy Davidson"]}, {"page": "Dykehead F.C.", "response": ["* Tommy Davidson"]}, {"page": "Thomas Davidson", "response": ["*Tommy Davidson (born 1963), American actor", "*Tommy Davidson (footballer) (1873\u20131949), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1903\u201304 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Tommy Davidson"]}, {"page": "1904\u201305 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["It was a summer of fundraising for the Brentford board during the 1904 off-season, with the club needing to raise money for the work being undertaken at its new Griffin Park ground.White, p. 82-85. \u00a3600 was raised (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) to pay summer wages for the squad and manager Dick Molyneux was once again able to sign new players soon after the end of the 1903\u201304 season, with goalkeeper Walter Whittaker, half back Jimmy Tomlinson and forwards John Boag, Fred Hobson, Frank Oliver, Alex Walker and Joe Warrington being signings of note. Molyneux's biggest transfer coup was that of forward Tommy Shanks, who returned to Brentford after 18 months away and off the back of a season in which he had scored 25 goals in Woolwich Arsenal's Football League Second Division triumph. The summer wages allowed full backs Jock Watson, Tommy Davidson and half backs James Bellingham, Jimmy Jay and George Parsonage to be retained, which on paper made the Bees' 1904\u201305 Southern League First Division squad arguably the club's strongest yet."]}]}}
