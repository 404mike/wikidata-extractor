Among his translations into English are works by Alexis de Tocqueville, \u00c9douard Dujardin, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Georges Simenon, Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. He also assisted in the translation of James Joyce's Ulysses into French.\nHe was born at Kelvedon Hatch, Essex, on 25 October 1883, the only son of a retired army officer, Arthur Stronge Gilbert, and Melvina, daughter of Randhir Singh,  the Raja of Kapurthala. He attended Cheltenham and Hertford College, Oxford, taking a first in Classical Moderations. He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1907 and, after military service in the First World War, served as a judge in Burma until 1925. He then retired, settling in France with his French-born wife Moune (n\u00e9e Marie Douin). He remained there for the rest of his life, except for some time spent in Wales during the Second World War.\nGilbert was one of the first Joycean scholars. He first read Ulysses while he was in Burma and admired it greatly. According to his wife, she and Gilbert were taking a walk in the Latin Quarter of Paris when they passed Shakespeare and Company, and saw some typescript pages of a French translation of Ulysses by Auguste Morel and Valery Larbaud displayed in the window. Gilbert noted several serious errors in the French rendering and introduced himself to Sylvia Beach, who was impressed by his criticisms of the translation. She took his name and telephone number, and suggested that Joyce, who was assisting in the translation, would contact him. This began many years of friendship between Joyce and Gilbert. He published James Joyce's Ulysses: A Study in 1930 (revised edition 1950); contributed an important chapter, \"Prolegomena to Work in Progress,\" to Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress (1929), a collection of perspectives on the fragments of Joyce's \"work in progress,\" later completed as Finnegans Wake (1939); and published a collection of Joyce's letters in 1957.\nOne of Gilbert's major projects was the translation from French of Roger Martin du Gard's novel sequence Les Thibault. Running to nearly 1,900 pages in translation, it was published by the Viking Press in the United States in two volumes, The Thibaults (1939) and Summer 1914 (1941).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Plague (novel)", "response": ["* 1948, translated by Stuart Gilbert, London: Hamish Hamilton", "* 1960, translated by Stuart Gilbert, London: Penguin, "]}, {"page": "James Joyce", "response": ["* Letters of James Joyce Vol. 1 (Ed.

In 1929, these essays (along with a few others written for the occasion) were collected under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress and published by Shakespeare and Company.
