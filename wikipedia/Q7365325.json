In order to perform these flights, a purpose-built gantry-like arrangement had been devised and assembled at Hucknall which, while not restricting the aircraft's movement within a defined space, prevented it from exceeding that boundary; it also prevented excessive descent rates, allowing for a maximum descent rate of 10\u00a0ft per second, from occurring in order to avoid sustaining damage and allowed struggling pilots to readily close the throttles without a resulting accident.Illingworth 1961, pp. 2, 17. During the first year of flights, the aircraft remained tethered within the gantry system for flight testing. On 3 August 1954, the TMR conducted its first free flight, piloted by Ronald Thomas Shepherd, Rolls-Royce's chief test pilot."]}, {"page": "Nuthall", "response": ["Captain Ronald Thomas Shepherd, of Highfield Road, Nuthall was awarded the OBE for his wartime services as chief test pilot for Rolls-Royce.

Mr Cyril Lovesey, a private pilot at Nottingham Airport (later RAF Tollerton) had seen the potential at RAF Hucknall. A request to the Air Ministry was made to share the land with the RAF and also for the use of two General Service Sheds for engine development and test flying purposes. Permission was granted and the RR Flight Test Establishment started operating in December 1934. The Chief Test Pilot was Captain Ronald Thomas Shepherd (Ronnie Shephard), who had been a member of the RFC."]}, {"page": "R.T.
