Of the most prominent, shows such as Nanny 911 and Supernanny which are both British programs in origin are parodied extensively. Both TV show hosts Stella Reid and Jo Frost are portrayed having accentuated British accents and stereotypically bad teeth. Unlike the \"real\" television shows, neither Stella's or Jo's methods of disciplining unruly children work - ultimately forcing an insulted Stella to refuse to work with Cartman, and Jo Frost being admitted to a psychiatric hospital, eating her own excrement and repeating the phrase \"It's from Hell!\" The Dog Whisperer is also featured in the episode, along with show host Cesar Millan, who, unlike most celebrities that were portrayed on the show, is shown in a more positive light. A Skeksis from The Dark Crystal can be seen as one of the nannies. The visual effect of Cartman's angel and devil subconsciousnesses during the part where he almost attempts to kill his mother in her room was a similar reference to the 1997 science-fiction film Contact. The way Cartman changes as he makes his way down the hallway is a direct reference to the 1980 body horror film Altered States."]}, {"page": "Hameldon Community College", "response": ["* Stella Reid, TV nanny (Sixth-form only)"]}, {"page": "Unity College, Burnley", "response": ["* Stella Reid, TV nanny."]}, {"page": "Stella (given name)", "response": ["* Stella Reid, co-star of the Fox network reality television show Nanny 911", "* Stella Reid, the title character in a novel by A.
