Greatly respected in his day, he was eulogised by Samuel Garth under the name of Machaon in his poem 'The Dispensary' while Thomas Sydenham held him in high regard.He received his education at Richard Busby's Westminster School, and then in 1645, at Trinity College, Cambridge under James Duport. From here he graduated AB in 1649, and moved on to Oxford University, obtaining his AM. He was elected a fellow of All Souls College and became a doctor of medicine at Oxford on 9 July 1659. Appointed to the chair of Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy in 1675, a position he held for life. Admitted as a candidate for the College of Physicians in 1659, he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1672. He was in turn Censor, Harveian Orator, Treasurer, Consiliarius and President, and was present at the deathbed of Charles II.\nAfter his admittance to the College of Physicians, he was said to be 'the delight of it; affable in his conversation, firm in his friendships, diligent and happy in his practice, candid and open in consultations, eloquent to an extraordinary degree in his public speeches; being chosen President, his behaviour was grave, tempered with courtesy, steady without obstinacy, continually intent on the good of the College.' He was appointed physician in ordinary to William III and Mary II, and later to Queen Anne. Millington was knighted in 1679. Millington was one of the physicians to dissect William III's body.\nMillington had ventured in a conversation with Nehemiah Grew that the stamen (\"attire\") serves as the male organ for the production of the seed. Grew at once \"replied that he was of the same opinion, gave some reasons for thinking so, and answered some objections which might be made to it.\"Grew further explored this idea and found that stamens with their thecae are male sex organs while pistils represent the female organs. These ideas were published by Grew in the Anatomy of Plants in 1682, which is today regarded as a major milepost in the development of botanical science.In 1691 he was living at Gosfield Hall and was responsible for a great deal of reconstruction. His family Coat of Arms is displayed in the hall and consists of the 'blazon of a silver shield, thereon a black eagle displayed with two heads, the crest being a bull's head erased,' and the motto  Virtutis proemium honor (\"Honour the reward of virtue\"). He married Hannah King, the widow of Henry King, on 23 February 1680. The union produced a son, Thomas (notorious as a rake), and two daughters, Anne and Mary.\nAccording to unsubstantiated family stories, a certain \"Lady Anne\" followed her lover, a British army officer, to America, but eventually married Gershom Lockwood of Greenwich.  The story of this woman's aristocratic roots is supported by her receipt of an ornate chest in the 1660s filled with \"half a bushel of guineas and many fine silk dresses\".  These sources however fail to substantiate a paternal link between this woman and Sir Thomas.  Indeed, Parliamentary probate records successfully demonstrate Anne Millington, daughter of Sir Thomas Millington as having died intestate, unmarried and childless.Thomas Millington was laid to rest on 28 January 1703\u20134 in the Wentworth Chapel of Gosfield church. A monument of Purbeck marble to his memory was destroyed some sixty years on by looters who tore up the brasswork. There is a good portrait of Millington at the College. Linnaeus named the genus Millingtonia in the Bignoniaceae in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Savilian Professor of Astronomy", "response": ["|Keill studied in Edinburgh with David Gregory and moved to Balliol with him in 1691 when Gregory was appointed as the Savilian astronomy professor. An accomplished pupil of Gregory, Keill was the first to teach a course on Newtonian principles at Oxford or Cambridge, lecturing in experimental philosophy at Hart Hall. He began deputising for Thomas Millington (Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy) in 1699 but after Millington died in 1704 Keill was not appointed as his successor, nor were his hopes of succeeding Gregory realised. After serving in various government roles, including decipherer to Queen Anne, he was elected to succeed Carswell. Described as \"one of the most influential natural philosophers in Britain\" for his work on Newtonian principles. he was one of the first to suggest that there might be attractions between invisible particules within matter that caused states such as elasticity and fluidity. His publications included his lectures on astronomy.

This work coined the term neurology, and was not the result of his own personal and unaided exertions; he acknowledged his debt to Sir Christopher Wren, who provided drawings, Thomas Millington, and his fellow anatomist Richard Lower. It abounds in new information, and presents an enormous contrast with the vaguer efforts of his predecessors."]}, {"page": "Ralph Bathurst", "response": ["Bathurst was active in the intellectual ferment of the time, and very well connected.

Also in that group were Willis, William Petty and Seth Ward.. fordham.edu The group expanded in the 1650s when it gathered around John Wilkins of Wadham College, close however to Oliver Cromwell, and then included also Jonathan Goddard, Thomas Millington, Laurence Rooke, and Christopher Wren.

In a society that placed such a high importance on class and economic status, the coffeehouses were unique because the patrons were people from all levels of society.Boulton, William B. The Amusements of Old London.  London: Ballantyne, Hanson & Co., 1901. Anyone who had a penny could come inside. Students from the universities also frequented the coffeehouses, sometimes even spending more time at the shops than at school.Ellis, Aytoun. The Penny Universities; A History of the Coffee-houses.  London, Secker & Warburg, 1956. Cowan states: \"The coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to congregate, to read, as well as learn from and to debate with each other, but was emphatically not a university institution, and the discourse there was of a far different order than any university tutorial.\"Cowan, 2005. p 91 Despite later coffeehouses being far more inclusive, early Oxford coffeehouses had an air of exclusivity, catering to the virtuosi. Early Oxford coffeehouse virtuosi included Christopher Wren, Peter Pett, Thomas Millington, Timothy Baldwin, and John Lampshire, to name a few.Cowan, 2005. p 90 The memoirs of Anthony Wood and John Evelyn provide evidence of the nature of early Oxford coffeehouses. The early Oxford coffeehouses also helped establish the tone for future coffeehouses in England, as they would differ from other English social institutions such as alehouses and taverns. \"The coffeehouse was a place for \"virtuosi\" and \"wits\", rather than for the plebes or rou\u00e9s who were commonly portrayed as typical patrons of the alcoholic drinking houses.Cowan, 2005. p 94 Ellis concludes, \"(Oxford's coffeehouses') power lay in the fact that they were in daily touch with the people. Their purpose was something more than to provide a meeting-place for social intercourse and gossip; there was serious and sober discussion on all matters of common interest.\"Ellis, 1956. p 29"]}, {"page": "Gosfield", "response": ["The Hall appears to have undergone occasional remodelling after coming into the possession of wealthy families, followed by periods of lengthy decline as either the money ran out or the family moved elsewhere. The  Wentworth  line ended with Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet, who died in 1631, having wasted the \"splendid inheritance\" left to him by his father John Wentworth. By 1691 the Hall had come into the possession of Sir Thomas Millington, physician to the joint monarchs, William III and Mary II. Millington is credited with the reconstruction of the Grand Salon and with building guest quarters above it. By 1715 the Hall was the property of the leading politician, John Knight. Knight is believed to have had the east fa\u00e7ade remodelled. After Knight's death the Hall came into the hands of the Earl Nugent, another prominent politician, who had married Knight's daughter. Nugent added a ballroom to the Hall and had the deerpark landscaped. On Nugent's death the Hall came into the ownership of George Grenville-Temple, Marquis of Buckingham. Buckingham had married Nugent's daughter, however, he preferred to make his ancestral seat, Stowe, his primary residence. As a result the Hall fell out of favour for many decades."]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the Royal College of Physicians", "response": ["*1696\u20131703 Sir Thomas Millington (died in office)"]}]}}
