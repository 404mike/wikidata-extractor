He was a medical doctor.\nJennens was born in Solihull, United Kingdom. He attended Oundle School and in 1947 went up to Clare College, Cambridge. He stroked the Clare coxless four that won the Cambridge University event twice, and in 1949 won the Visitors' Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.In eights racing, Jennens stroked the Clare crew that rowed Head of the River in the 1949 May Bumps. He earned his Blue when he stroked Cambridge to a win by a quarter of a length against Oxford in the 1949 Boat Race. He rowed in the number two seat of the 1950 winning Cambridge crew, and then returned to the stroke seat for the Cambridge victory of 1951. The umpire had ordered a re-row of the 1951 race after Oxford sank in treacherous conditions.Also in 1951, Jennens was the stroke of the British eight that won the European Rowing Championships in M\u00e2con, France. In 1952, he stroked the Leander Club eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley. This crew went on to row as Great Britain in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, finishing fourth.Jennens qualified as a doctor at St Thomas' Hospital in London. He worked for a while in Canada, before returning to general practice in Cambridge. He was a Steward of Henley Royal Regatta, and he coached many rowing crews from Cambridge University, Clare Boat Club, and Cambridge town clubs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*David Jennens (Clare), European Champion and Olympian (1952)"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* David Jennens"]}, {"page": "Clare Boat Club", "response": ["*David Jennens, represented Cambridge University and Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Solihull", "response": ["*David Jennens (b. 1929), Olympic and Cambridge University rower, born in Solihull"]}, {"page": "List of Old Oundelians", "response": ["*David Jennens, Olympic rower"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Clare College, Cambridge", "response": ["*David Jennens, rower who represented Cambridge University and Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Jennens", "response": ["*David Jennens (1929 \u2013 2000), English rower"]}, {"page": "The Boat Race 1967", "response": ["Cambridge's coaching team included Norman Addison (rowed for Cambridge in the 1939 race), James Crowden (1951 and 1952 races), David Jennens (1949, 1950 and 1951 races), Mike Muir-Smith (1964 race), Mike Nicholson (non-rowing boat club president for the 1947 race), J.
