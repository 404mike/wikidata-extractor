This was followed by a 0\u20130 draw away to fellow strugglers Barrow. Before York's penultimate home match against Eastbourne, Parslow was named the 2008\u201309 Clubman of the Year, voted for by the club's supporters. A 1\u20130 victory saw York move out of the relegation zone, in what was their first league win in 10 matches. It was achieved after McBreen scored from a Purkiss pass in the 35th minute. A second successive win came at home to Forest Green, who York beat 2\u20131 with second-half goals from Boyes and Brodie."]}, {"page": "John Allan", "response": ["*Jonny Allan (born 1983), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Allan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonny Allan"]}]}}
