(1829 \u2013 10 May 1913), was a prominent Scottish collector of art and oriental ceramics, illustrator and landscape watercolourist.

Rather than being a forger as some modern scholars like to believe Orrock was a dedicated enthusiast of contemporary British art and emulated some of those artists in his own work. He illustrated three books in the style of Turner: Mary Queen-of-Scots, 1906; Old England : her story mirrored in her scenes, 1908; and, In the Border country, 1906.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* James Orrock (1829\u20131913), collector of art and Oriental ceramics"]}, {"page": "David Cox (artist)", "response": ["Several of his works are in Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, having been donated by Joseph Henry Nettlefold, on the condition it opened on Sundays.Barbara M.
