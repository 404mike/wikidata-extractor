Led by Willerton, the contestants demanded answers from organizers and later made claims that some contestants had been offered automatic top-ranking placements in exchange for sex. The illicit offers were filmed by Willerton and other contestants, and were later uploaded to YouTube under the title \"Confessions of a Beauty Queen\". Subsequently, she and the contestants Aletha Shepherd of Guyana, and Pamela Peralta of Costa Rica, fled their hotel to the airport. The fleeing contestants claimed the pageant organizers tried to detain them against their will and followed them to the airport to keep them from escaping. The Korean National Police Agency and organizers denied all accusations. Willerton claimed that the organizers bribed the police officers, \"When the police arrived they called in one of the chairmen of the pageant who actually got his wallet out straight away and we were all pushed back by the organizers so we couldn't speak...Our translator would not translate for us, so we were completely helpless.\""]}, {"page": "Miss Universe 2013", "response": ["*  \u2013 Amy Willerton", "|  Great Britain || Amy Willerton || 21 || London"]}, {"page": "Charlotte Holmes", "response": ["In her third and final attempt to win the Miss England title, Holmes competed at Miss London in February 2012.
