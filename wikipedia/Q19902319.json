In January 2016 she was appointed to be the artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe in London. Just a few months into the role, in October 2016, it was announced that Rice would be leaving it in April 2018; the announcement followed a decision by the theatre's board, which cited concerns over authenticity and her use of lighting technology. Formerly, Rice was artistic director of the Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall, England.\nRice was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire and grew up in Nottingham. She moved to London to study acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and went on to perform at Kneehigh beginning in 1994. Kneehigh Artistic directors Bill Mitchell and Mike Shepherd eventually gave her a shot at directing, and she rose to prominence with ambitious performances that included productions in London's West End as well as smaller theatres. Rice says that her long-running production of The Red Shoes represented a turning point in her career when she came into her own.An adaptation of Rebecca directed by Rice toured the UK in 2015.Standard Issue Magazine made her their woman of the year in 2016 for \u201cher fearlessness, leadership, innovation and bravery\u201d.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "response": ["Artistic director Emma Rice's first production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2016 was a version of the play.
