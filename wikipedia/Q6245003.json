Nevertheless, several small Carlin-type deposits were discovered in northern Nevada and worked as mines prior to the discovery of the Carlin orebody.  John Livermore examined one such deposit at the Standard Mine near Lovelock, Nevada in the late 1940s and believed that other, possibly richer, \"invisible gold\" deposits remained to be found.", "Guided by Ralph Roberts\u2019 ideas, John Livermore and Alan Coope, a fellow Newmont geologist who had a strong background in geochemistry, began an intensive search for \u201cinvisible gold.\u201d  Success came quickly.
