In 1905, Boyle set up the Lady Chichester Hospital in Brighton for women suffering with mental diseases. The hospital offered free or low cost care in a mostly women environment. This practice was made specifically for the treatment of early mental disorders which was the first facility ever created for that type of treatment. The practice later relocated to Hove, and was founded to counter the problem of mentally ill women being sent to asylums. The facility was the only one in Brighton to provide inpatient care. One of Boyle's patients in 1922 was the outsider artist Madge Gill, who she seems to have supported in her ambitions to display her works."]}, {"page": "London Borough of Newham Heritage Service", "response": [" Although much of those collections has been transferred to other institutions (such as Godfrey Kneller's 1721 The Harvey Family), the collection run by the service is still substantial and includes significant holdings of Bow porcelain and of artworks by the outsider artist Madge Gill.
