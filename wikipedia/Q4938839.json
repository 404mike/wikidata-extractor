In her book chapter exploring how literacy in different knowledge types affects the series, Alice Curry described the factions and the character indoctrination in those factions as deliberately creating knowledge gaps between initiates to different factions. Because of the initiation process, the characters become illiterate in the knowledge that is valued by the other factions. Tris's \"divergence\" allows her to be successful because she can become literate in a broad set of knowledges and information types and so she becomes more admirable to the reader. Curry argues that Jeanine's leadership in Erudite represents an academic ivory tower that alienates other types of knowledge and so the book critiques academic learning in favor of the broader knowledge that is embodied by Tris. Curry compares the novel to Julie Bertagna's 2002 Exodus, describing both as using spaces and landscapes in which knowledge is learned, to critique \"crumbling knowledge institutions,\" like academic spaces that \"dissemble\" knowledge instead of facilitating deeper holistic knowledge literacies that create \"understanding.\""]}, {"page": "Climate fiction", "response": ["*Exodus (2002) and sequels, Julie Bertagna, US"]}, {"page": "Bertagna", "response": ["*Julie Bertagna (born 1962), Scottish writer"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish science fiction writers", "response": ["*Julie Bertagna"]}]}}
