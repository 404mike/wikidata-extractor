Tom Stott was the de facto leader of the independent caucus within parliament. At the time of his death in office in 1958, it was reported that he had supported the incumbent Tom Playford Liberal and Country League government, which held office with a narrow majority.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Electoral district of Mount Gambier", "response": ["The electorate was created in the 1936 redistribution, taking effect at the 1938 election, but the name was not used between the 1993 and 2002 elections \u2013 the area was covered by the electoral district of Gordon during that time. It was one of the few country electoral districts that had never been held by the Liberal and Country League during the Playmander era. It was held by long-serving independent John Fletcher for the first two decades of its existence. Labor took the electorate at a 1958 by-election, and it was usually a marginal to fairly safe Labor electorate from then until the Liberals won it at the 1975 election on a 15.5 percent swing. Mount Gambier was one of several rural electorates where Labor suffered large swings in that election\u2013notably 13.5 percent in Chaffey and 16.4 percent in Millicent.
