For the second year in succession Surrey played Middlesex in the final game of the season, to decide the County Championship, and again they lost. They finished second in the table, but were hampered throughout the season by a lack of quality bowling. Wisden praised Fender's intelligent handling of his modest bowling resources, and stated that much of Surrey's success came from his captaincy. Several of Surrey's victories were very close, and had come after Fender declared.Streeton, p. 119. Fender took the brave decision to include a lob bowler, Trevor Molony, in three games; lob bowling had practically died out from first-class cricket by this time, and Molony was the last specialist underarm bowler selected in county cricket. But Molony met with fairly limited success and faded out of cricket.Streeton, p. 121. Owing to the lack of penetrative alternatives, Fender had to use his own bowling frequently, and often conceded many runs. Wisden said he was generally effective with the ball and described his slip fielding as \"dazzling\", but suggested that perhaps his best batting came for teams other than Surrey. In all first-class matches Fender completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the first time; he scored 1,152 runs at 21.33 and took 134 wickets at 26.58. He also took 53 catches to become the first cricketer to pass 50 catches while completing the double; as of 2021, only Peter Walker has also done so.Streeton, p. 116."]}, {"page": "Geoff Griffin", "response": ["At Lord's, England batted first and scored 362. The match provided mixed fortunes for the beleaguered bowler. In the third over of the innings, Griffin was no-balled by umpire Frank Lee, and ten further times by the same umpire, before the innings closed in sensational fashion. In three successive balls, Griffin had Mike Smith caught behind for 99, Peter Walker bowled for 52, and Fred Trueman bowled for 0, to record the first-ever hat-trick in a Test at Lords. South Africa were then twice bowled out cheaply, the match ending with their defeat early on the afternoon of Monday 26 June. Because a visit from the Queen was scheduled for later that afternoon, to fill the available time the teams agreed to play an exhibition match of 20 overs per side.", "Not everyone was convinced that Griffin threw rather than bowled the ball. The former England batsman Denis Compton wrote: \"I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw\". Against this, the South African commentator Charles Fortune was convinced that Griffin threw, as were his team-mates Waite and Adcock. Fortune questioned the wisdom of the selectors in sending Griffin to England: \"they chanced their arm\", he wrote. The England batsman Peter Walker, who played at Lord's, was unequivocal: \"There was absolutely no doubt in either Mike [Smith]'s or my mind that he threw virtually every ball\"."]}, {"page": "Peter Walker", "response": ["Peter Walker may refer to:", "* Peter Walker (Australian politician) (1922\u20131987)", "* Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester (1932\u20132010), British politician", "* Peter Walker (RAF officer) (1949\u20132015), Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey", "* Peter Walker (cricketer, born 1936) (1936\u20132020), English cricketer and broadcaster", "* Peter Walker (cricketer, born 1952), English cricketer for Devon", "* Peter Walker (footballer) (1942\u20132010), Australian rules footballer", "* Peter Walker (golfer), Scottish golfer", "* Peter Walker (racing driver) (1912\u20131984), British racing driver", "* Peter Walker (brewer) (died 1879), Scottish brewer", "* Peter Walker (bishop) (1919\u20132010), Anglican bishop", "* Peter Walker (guitarist) (born 1937), American folk guitarist", "* Peter Walker (dancer), New York City Ballet", "* Peter Walker (landscape architect), American"]}, {"page": "Stephen Chalke", "response": ["Chalke retired from Fairfield Books at the end of 2019 having run it more than 20 years.
