He was the chief economist at the Economics and Statistics Department at the OECD during 1984\u20131992. Before that he worked as an academic economist in Britain, first at Oxford (Fellow of Lincoln College) and later at University College London (Professor of Economics, 1975\u20131983); as a British civil servant (first as an Economic Advisor in HM Treasury, and later as Chief Economist in the Ministry of Aviation); and as a staff member of the World Bank (1969\u20131975).  In 1985 he gave the BBC Reith Lectures, which were published in the book Innocence and Design: The Influence of Economic Ideas on Policy (Blackwell, 1986).\nAfter leaving the OECD, Henderson was an independent author and consultant, and acted as Visiting Fellow or Professor at the OECD Development Centre (Paris), the Centre for European Policy Studies (Brussels), Monash University, the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques, the University of Melbourne, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the New Zealand Business Roundtable, the Melbourne Business School, and Westminster Business School. Subsequently he was a Fellow of the Institute of Economic Affairs.In 1992, Henderson was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Companion (CMG).\nHenderson has published books that strongly criticize \"corporate social responsibility\" (see \u00a7Books, below).Henderson and Nigel Lawson appealed to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to investigate the economic implications of the potential implementation of policies put forth by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings.\nHenderson and Ian Castles, a former head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics argued that the IPCC's projections of future emissions of greenhouse gases was flawed. The IPCC's forecasts of global output were based on national GDP converted to dollars using market exchange rates. Henderson and Ian Castles were critical of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that was published in 2000.:\u200a159\u2013185\u200a:\u200a415\u2013435\u200a The core of their critique was the use of market exchange rates (MER) for international comparison, in lieu of the theoretically favoured PPP exchange rate which corrects for differences in purchasing power. The IPCC rebutted this criticism. Castles and Henderson later acknowledged that they were mistaken that future greenhouse gas emissions had been significantly overestimated.Henderson has suggested about climate change that the science is not settled, and he specifically criticized the Stern Review regarding the economics of global warming. Relatedly, in 2008, Nigel Lawson published the book An Appeal to Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming; the dedication for the book says \"To David Henderson, who first aroused my interest in all this\". (The following year, Lawson went on to found the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate change denialist think-tank, whose Academic Advisory Council Henderson went on to chair).He was educated at Ellesmere College, Shropshire.\nHe died on 30 September 2018 at the age of 91.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor", "response": ["An ambitious construction programme of five twin reactor stations, Dungeness B, Hinkley Point B, Hunterston B, Hartlepool and Heysham was quickly rolled out, and export orders were eagerly anticipated. However, the AGR design proved to be over complex and difficult to construct on site. Notoriously bad labour relations at the time added to the problems. The lead station, Dungeness B was ordered in 1965 with a target completion date of 1970. After problems with nearly every aspect of the reactor design it finally began generating electricity in 1983, 13 years late. The following reactor designs at Hinkley Point and Hunterston significantly improved on the original design and indeed were commissioned ahead of Dungeness. The next AGR design at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool sought to reduce overall cost of design by reducing the footprint of the station and the number of ancillary systems. The final two AGRs at Torness and Heysham 2 returned to a modified Hinkley design and have proved to be the most successful performers of the fleet.

As the Magnox design was being rolled out, work was already underway on the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) with the explicit intention of making the system more economical. Primary among the changes was the decision to run the reactor at much higher temperatures, about , which would greatly improve the efficiency when running the power-extracting steam turbines. This was too hot for the magnox alloy, and the AGR originally intended to use a new beryllium-based cladding, but this proved too brittle. This was replaced by a stainless steel cladding, but this absorbed enough neutrons to affect criticality, and in turn required the design to operate on slightly enriched uranium rather than the Magnox's natural uranium, driving up fuel costs. Ultimately the economics of the system proved little better than Magnox.
