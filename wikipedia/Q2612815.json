Later he transferred to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. In 1908 he joined the National Herbarium, and was appointed Chief Botanist and Curator from 1933 to 1936. He described plants in the Myrtle family such as Melaleuca howeana. Apart from the myrtles, his other main botanic interest were the lichens. He traveled extensively in collection of botanical specimens, which are lodged in New South Wales. He has a street named after him in the suburb of Farrer, in the Australian Capital Territory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Society of New South Wales", "response": ["|1931 || Edwin Cheel || Botany ||"]}, {"page": "Melaleuca alternifolia", "response": ["This species was first formally described in 1905 by Joseph Maiden and Ernst Betche and given the Melaleuca linariifolia var. alternifolia in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales.

Brown described varieties glaber, identified by wholly smooth leaves and branches, and pubescens, with leaves and branches covered in fine pale grey hairs, in 1830. English botanist George Bentham tentatively described variety pubiflorus in his 1870 work Flora Australiensis. He queried that it may have been from Sydney, and had a slightly hairy perianth. These are not regarded as distinct. Victorian Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller described I.\u00a0anemonifolius var. tenuifolius in 1870, now recognised as I.\u00a0prostratus. Australian botanist Edwin Cheel described forma simplicifolia in 1923, from collections from Mount Victoria and Hornsby. He described it as having mostly unlobed (simple) leaves compared with the typical form. His variety ceratophylloides is now a separate species, I. petiolaris."]}, {"page": "Fungi of Australia", "response": ["John Burton Cleland conducted the first systematic review of Australian fungi in a landmark monograph of fungal specimens at the South Australian Herbarium. Comprising some 16,000 specimens, this included fungi from elsewhere in the country as well as South Australia. He was assisted by such people as Edwin Cheel, keeper of the Herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, Leonard Rodway of Tasmania and Phyllis Clarke (later North), who provided some watercolour paintings. These three were honoured with at least one specific epithet of new species described by Cleland. This resulted in two comprehensive volumes (1934\u201335) on the larger fungi of South Australia, and was reprinted in 1976.
