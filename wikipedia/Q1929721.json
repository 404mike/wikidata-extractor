He argued that the conquest of the mountain was a victory for science since doctors had finally figured out how to cope with the physiological effects of high altitude.  His discoveries a few years earlier in the Royal Geographic Society archives of the Milne-Hink map and unofficial RAF photos of the Everest area helped to make the summit ascent possible.He had been on the earlier 1951 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition which pioneered the route used by the 1953 expedition. He was asked by Eric Shipton to go on the 1952 British Cho Oyu expedition, but was completing his national military service and sitting an surgery examination. He was a pioneer in high altitude medicine, which he researched with Griffith Pugh on the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition.\nHe wrote numerous books including Everest: A Thousand Years of Exploration.He was a supporter of the National Health Service and the East End of London rather than Harley Street. He was a lecturer in Clinical Surgery at the London Hospital Medical College 1975\u201393, and Consultant Surgeon at St Andrew's Hospital, Bow 1964-93 and Newham Hospital 1983\u201393.\nHe was awarded a CBE in 1983. He was from London. He wrote an autobiography In This Short Span (1972).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gigantopithecus", "response": ["Gigantopithecus has been used in cryptozoology circles as the identity of the Tibetan yeti or American bigfoot, humanlike monsters in local folklore. This began in 1960 with zoologist Wladimir Tschernezky, briefly describing in the journal Nature a 1951 photograph of alleged yeti tracks taken by Himalayan mountaineers Michael Ward and Eric Shipton. Tschernezky concluded that the yeti walked like a human and was similar to Gigantopithecus. Subsequently, the yeti attracted short-lived scientific attention, with several more authors publishing in Nature and Science, but this also incited a popular monster hunting following for both the yeti and the similar American bigfoot which has persisted into the present day. The only scientist who continued trying to prove such monsters exist was anthropologist Grover Krantz, who continued pushing for a connection between Gigantopithecus and bigfoot from 1970 to his death in 2002. Among the binomial names he came up with for bigfoot included \"Gigantopithecus canadensis\". Krantz did not meet support from either mainstream science or amateurs who said he readily accepted clearly false evidence."]}, {"page": "Pundit (explorer)", "response": ["An extensive list of the pundits (and their forerunners) has been detailed chronologically by Michael Ward in the Alpine Journal Volume 103, 1998.

In the 1951 Everest expedition, Shipton and Dr Michael Ward also took photographs of the footprints of what may have been the Yeti (Abominable Snowman), an ice axe being included in the photographs to show scale. Because of his belief in the efficacy of small expeditions as compared to military-style 'sieges', Shipton was stepped down from the leadership of the 1953 Everest expedition, along with Andrew Croft, in favour of Major John Hunt: \"I leave London absolutely shattered\", he wrote. Between the years 1953 and 1957 he worked at a variety of jobs. Shipton worked as Warden of the Outward Bound Mountain school at Eskdale until the failure of his marriage with his wife, Diana.
