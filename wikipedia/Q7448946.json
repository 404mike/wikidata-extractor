Alf Jones was given his first professional contract, whilst Selwyn Whalley (who was training to become teacher), Harry Oliver and John Poole (both engineering apprentices) all were given part-time professional contracts.

This was achieved with Low's attacking policy, a stark contract to 'the Steele Curtain' defence. However their five clean sheets in their first eight games also illustrated their defensive strength. In September, right-half Selwyn Whalley turned part-time, dividing his duties between playing football and teaching at Hanley High School. Winger Alan Bennett was also transferred to Crewe Alexandra. By November, Vale were third in the league, and Low signed Bert Carberry and Jack Wilkinson.
