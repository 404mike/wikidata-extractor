In the book, he called for the Labour Party to adopt a policy of \"educational credit\", a system whereby lower and middle-income families whose children attend failing schools can withdraw their children and get funding, worth 150% the cost of education at the failing school, in order to pay for a place at a higher achieving school for the child, with the money coming from the budget of the failing school. The policy was rejected by the leftwing MP Michael Meacher but was welcomed by Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg and other shadow cabinet members."]}, {"page": "Patricia Hewitt", "response": ["* Information Age Government: Delivering the Blair Revolution by Liam Byrne, foreword by Patricia Hewitt, 1997, Fabian Society, "]}, {"page": "Chief Secretary to the Treasury", "response": ["| Liam ByrneMP for Birmingham Hodge Hill"]}, {"page": "Blairism", "response": ["* Liam Byrne \u2013 former shadow Work and Pensions Secretary."]}, {"page": "Terry Davis (politician)", "response": ["In 2004 he was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe, and announced his intention to stand down from the UK parliament by applying for the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds.
