He and his wife, Lady Anne Blunt travelled in the Middle East and were instrumental in preserving the Arabian horse bloodlines through their farm, the Crabbet Arabian Stud. He was best known for his poetry, which appeared in a collected edition in 1914, but he also wrote political essays and polemics. He became additionally known for his strongly anti-imperialist views, which were still uncommon in his time.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
