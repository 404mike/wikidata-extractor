She published her first book of poems, Floral Symphony, in 1900. In 1910 she edited A Book of Verse by Living Women.

Underlying all of these policies was an inherent distrust of the concept of empire and a cardinal belief in the traditional assertions of Cobden, that Britain should promote peace, and avoid interference in the political institutions of other nations. In many respects, Egypt was Lawson's defining moment as an anti-imperialist radical. He not only led the agitation but he disagreed with the opinions of many of his radical contemporaries, colleagues he had and would later stand shoulder to shoulder with in agitating against similar imperialist concerns.Trouble Makers, A.J.P.
