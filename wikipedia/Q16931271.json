He had already been created a Baronet, of Little Warley in the County of Essex, in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 14 September 1776. His son, Charles Winn-Allanson, 2nd Baron Headley, represented Ripon, Malton and Ludgershall in Parliament. In 1833 he succeeded a distant relative as 8th Baronet, of Nostel (see below). His nephew, the third Baron (the son of the Honourable George Allanson-Winn, MP for Malton), sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1868 to 1877. His son, the fourth Baron, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1883 to 1913. His cousin, Rowland Allanson-Winn, 5th Baron Headley, was a prominent convert to Islam.
