Their first game of that season was a visit to Manchester United at Old Trafford, where they lost 2\u20130. However, they did manage to hold Manchester United to a 1\u20131 draw in the return game at Meadow Lane just after the turn of the year, as United began a dismal second half of the season which ultimately cost them the league title. County's relegation came shortly after the sale of strikers Paul Rideout and Tommy Johnson, which raked in nearly \u00a32million in total and contributed towards a \u00a35million stadium revamp which saw Meadow Lane rebuilt on three sides shortly afterwards. With the introduction of the Premier League, County were relegated from the old Division One to the new Division One. Warnock was dismissed in January 1993 and was succeeded by Mick Walker. Walker successfully averted a second consecutive relegation."]}, {"page": "Mo Johnston", "response": ["On 18 November 1991, Johnston signed to Everton for \u00a31.5m, forming a three-man strikeforce alongside Tony Cottee and Peter Beardsley.
