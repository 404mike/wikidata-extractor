Named after the Canterbury street on which the members lived, its lyrics express the anti-capitalistic, anti-materialistic orientation of the band and of the broader Canterbury scene. The album has been described as \"effectively a document of Spirogyra's well-honed live set\". Released in September 1971, it received positive reviews in NME and other rock publications, and was supported by a 24-date tour of the United Kingdom.

The accompaniment by the classically trained Cale reflects Drake's desire to move away from the pastoral sound of his 1969 debut album Five Leaves Left, which was a commercial failure. Cale's own career was similarly in tatters; he had been fired from the Velvets by Lou Reed two years earlier, and was yet to re-establish his reputation as a formidable producer. Drake sought to broaden his own appeal and tentatively agreed to Boyd's suggestion to include bass and drum tracks on recordings for Bryter Layter, and to experiment with a more pop or jazzy sound, which Boyd admitted he imagined would be \"more commercial\".Dann (2006), p. 142 Yet it essentially retains Drake's original acoustic style, being anchored by long term producers and arrangers Robert Kirby and John Wood's sharp and stripped-down sparse engineering and production values. Trevor Dann believes that the contrasting approach of the two men  produced accompaniment that is \"opulent without overpowering the fragile little song\".Dann,  p. 242", "Boyd was at the time working as co-producer with John Cale on Nico's Desertshore album. Boyd sent the recently ex-Velvet Underground member a demo recording of a few of the tracks that were to form Bryter Layter.Dann,  p. 143 The morning Cale received them, he rang Boyd asking \"Who the fuck *is* this guy? I have to meet him, where is he right now.\" He described his first impressions after meeting Drake as of \"a very quiet guy. It was very difficult to figure what was going on in his mind. He made music with a real sensuality \u2013 very different from English folk music\".Dann,  p. 144 Boyd phoned Drake, and was given consent  \u2013 Boyd claims Drake's only words during the conversation were \"Oh, uh, OK\". He arranged a recording session for the following day, on the condition that Cale would be allowed to add accompaniment to the tracks. That morning, with Wood and Kirby engineering and assisting, they recorded \"Northern Sky\" and \"Fly\". Cale improvised piano, celeste, and Hammond organ parts on \"Northern Sky\", and viola and harpsichord arrangements on \"Fly\". In his 2006 biography of Drake, Trevor Dann describes Cale's contribution as infusing the tracks with a \"subtlety that Robert Kirby's full-blown arrangements didn't quite match on some of the other tracks [on Bryter Layter]."]}, {"page": "Robert Kirby (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Kirby (1948\u20132009) was a British musician and arranger.", "Robert Kirby may also refer to:", "* Robert Kirby (satirist) (1936\u20132007), South African satirist", "* Robert Kirby (humor columnist) (born 1953), syndicated humor columnist for the Salt Lake Tribune", "* Robert Kirby (cartoonist) (born 1962), American comics artist"]}, {"page": "Keith Christmas", "response": ["Although predominantly an acoustic guitarist, he was not averse to playing electric guitar and regularly jammed with Bristol-based, acid rock band, Magic Muscle.
