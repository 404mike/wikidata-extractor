However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker. Compare", "In Standard English, two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop Robert Lowth wrote A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes. For instance, \"I don't disagree\" could mean \"I certainly agree\",  \"I agree\", \"I sort of agree\", \"I don't understand your point of view (POV)\", \"I have no opinion\", and so on; it is a form of \"weasel words\". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.", "In his Essay towards a practical English Grammar of 1711, James Greenwood first recorded the rule: \"Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm\". Robert Lowth stated in his grammar textbook A Short Introduction to English Grammar (1762) that \"two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative\". Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it.  Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared."]}, {"page": "Richard Mant", "response": ["Mant's Ancient Hymns from the Roman BreviaryAncient Hymns from the Roman Breviary (1837) was one of the earliest collections of translated Latin hymnody in English. He belonged to a group of revivalist translators of Latin hymns, with John Chandler (1806\u20131876) and Isaac Williams. John Ellerton commented on his good taste, but also discerned a lack of understanding of the group of hymns he was handling. The Psalms in an English Metrical VersionPsalms in an English Metrical Version (1824) were influenced by Robert Lowth's theories of biblical poetry, the psalms becoming \"stiff and stately odes\" according to John Julian."]}, {"page": "1710 in literature", "response": ["*November 27 \u2013 Robert Lowth, English poet, grammarian and bishop (died 1787)"]}, {"page": "1758 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Lowth \u2013 The Life of William of Wykeham"]}, {"page": "1762 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Lowth \u2013 A Short Introduction to English Grammar"]}, {"page": "1777 in literature", "response": ["*April 12 \u2013 The poet and grammarian Robert Lowth is appointed Bishop of London."]}, {"page": "1787 in literature", "response": ["*November 3 \u2013 Robert Lowth, English poet, grammarian and bishop (born 1710)"]}, {"page": "Linguistic prescription", "response": ["Some elements of prescription in English are sometimes thought to have been based on the norms of Latin grammar. Robert Lowth is frequently cited  as having done so, but he specifically objected to \"forcing the English under the rules of a foreign Language\".A Short Introduction to English Grammar, p. 107, condemning Richard Bentley's \"corrections\" of some of Milton's constructions.", "Finally, there is the problem of inappropriate dogmatism. Although competent authorities tend to make careful statements, popular pronouncements on language are apt to condemn. Thus, wise prescriptive advice identifying a form as colloquial or non-standard and suggesting that it be used with caution in some contexts may \u2013 when taken up in the classroom \u2013 become converted into a ruling that the dispreferred form is automatically unacceptable in all circumstances, a view academic linguists reject. (Linguists may accept that a construction is ungrammatical or incorrect in relation to a certain lect if it does not conform to its inherent rules, but they would not consider it absolutely wrong simply because it diverges from the norms of a prestige variety.) A classic example from 18th-century England is Robert Lowth's tentative suggestion that preposition stranding in relative clauses sounds colloquial. This blossomed into a grammatical rule that a sentence should never end with a preposition. Such dogmatism has often caused resentment."]}]}}
