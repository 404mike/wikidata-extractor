He also wrote crime fiction as Roger East.He was the son of Samuel Francis Burford (b. 1857, Desborough - d. 1935 Watford) an analytical chemist, and Clara d'Este Burford (n\u00e9e d'Este Emery, b. 1865, Market Harborough - d. 1935, Leicester). He had an elder brother, Francis Emery Buford (1898-1918), who was killed in action whilst a 2nd Lt. in the 1st. Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment, and sister Marjorie Clara Burford (b. 1899).\nBurford attended Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge University, going up in autumn 1922, and taking the English Tripos. In Easter Term 1923 he was a founder member of the Cambridge University Kinema Club (CUKC). During the 1923 vacation the club visited Gaumont Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London, and in the Michaelmas Term of that year it went to Famous Players-Lasky Studio in Islington, London, where George Pearson was shooting Reveille. Pearson later gave a talk to the CUKC in Lent Term, 1924.  Pearson's comedies would be a particular enthusiasm of Burford's in his early writing on film. In Michaelmas term 1923 Burford became friends with fellow CUKC member Christopher Isherwood. He is fictionalised as \"Roger East\" in Isherwood's novel Lions and Shadows. After graduating, Burford registered for two terms at Leicester School of Art, having some talent as a painter. In the spring of 1926 he briefly taught Greek at Wooton Court Preparatory School. He then moved to London, sharing rooms in a boarding house on Redcliffe Road, Chelsea, with the painter Stella Wilkinson (1903-1944), whom he had met at Leicester School of Art. Stella appears as \"Polly\" in Lions and Shadows. The couple left London for a trip to Milan in September 1926, letting Isherwood take over their rooms. On 28 April 1927 Burford married Stella in a London registry office, with Isherwood one of the two witnesses. The two men corresponded throughout the 1930s and Burford's letters are preserved in Isherwood's papers in the Huntington Library.Stella died in 1944, whilst the couple were living near Wincanton, Somerset. In 1949 he married Stella Jonckheere (b. , Roubaix) who was the literary editor at Ealing Studios, and later at Group 3.\nWRITING CAREER\nHe published the well-received \"realist\" novel Kay Walters, A Woman of the People in 1928. He remained active in British literary circles, publishing his poetry regularly in \"little magazines\" such as Seed and Booster and becoming a member of the editorial board of the poetry magazine Delta in April 1938. A collection of his verse was published in 1947.\nIn the late 1920s he also began a career as a writer of screen scenarios and scripts in the British film industry, being first of all employed as a scenario reader for Walter Mycroft at BIP in 1928. He would then become a scenario editor at British Instructional, before returning to BIP as a writer in 1932. He expanded into television in the 1950s, writing the BBC drama Three Steps in the Dark (1953). His abilities as both a crime novelist and screenwriter led to him specialising in TV crime drama for much of the 1960s. He was the principal scriptwriter for the BBC series Maigret (1960\u201364) and also wrote for the one-off series The Hidden Truth and The Sentimental Agent. He also wrote a single episode for the BBC series Dr. Finlay's Casebook in 1965.\nBurford was a diplomat in Moscow during World War II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oswell Blakeston", "response": ["He then edited the little magazine Seed with Herbert Jones, and wrote detective fiction with Roger Burford, under the pseudonym 'Simon'.

Both Pearson and Balfour were particular favourites of the British film critic, and later leading screenwriter, Roger Burford. In his first article for the magazine Close Up Burford would write \"Not long ago a film of the Squibbs series was reported to be on at a small cinema in a slum district. It was a rare chance, and we went at once. We were not disappointed: the film was English, with proper tang; the tang of Fielding or Sterne.'Roger Burford, 'What Next, and Then?', Close Up Vol. II, no. 2 (February 1928) p. 41 Burford's comments help place the Squibbs films perfectly in British culture between the wars. They were very much working-class comedy, drawing on a vernacular, performative tradition, but at the same time their \"Englishness\" is characteristic of the kinds of satirical comedies found in the novels of Henry Fielding and Laurence Sterne. That earthy satire, based on everyday life, made these comedies unpalatable to middle class audiences but the Squibbs films were amongst the most interesting, and well shot, films in Britain in the 1920s."]}, {"page": "Draft:Ernest Betts", "response": ["One reason for this was the success of his new book Heraclitus, or the future of films. Commissioned by Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner & Co. for its popularizing \u2018To-day and To-morrow\u2019 series on modern culture, science and technology, edited by the distinguished public intellectual C.K.

Those authors included such notable figures of British modernism as Robert Graves, Winifred Holtby and John Rodker, along with lesser lights like Gerald Heard, with other volumes coming from leading scientists such as J.B.S. Haldane, the eminent psychologist William McDougall, and the philosopher Bertrand Russell. Betts\u2019 contribution to the series, with its utopian emphasis, fitted well with the modernizing agenda that underpinned Ogden\u2019s series. The success of Heraclitus, and Betts\u2019 successful self-promotion as a public intellectual, would lead to opportunities in broadcasting with the BBC, as well as to publication in Close Up. Betts had been invited to speak on the BBC about cinema as early as the summer of 1927 though the opportunity came to nothing.Ernest Betts to R.S. Lambert, 18 July 1927, BBC Written Archives, Ernest Betts personal file. However, the publication of Heraclitus encouraged the BBC to commission from Betts four talks in 1929, with a fifth following in 1930.Ernest Betts, \u2018The Future of the Cinema\u2019, 6 March 1929, 9.15 pm; \u2018Film Criticism\u2019, 1 November 1929, \u2018Film Criticism\u2019, 15 November 1929, \u2018Film Criticism\u2019, 29 November 1929.

From 1934 he would be the film critic of both the Sunday Express and Daily Express.'Ernest Betts', International Motion Picture Almanac, 1937-38 Betts combined his critical work with an attempt to break into screenwriting. He finally succeeded by collaborating on the screenplay for Love in Exile (1936) with Roger Burford, Gene Markey and Herman J. Mankiewicz. He would be more successful, however, as a critic commentating on others' screenplays. He persuaded the publisher Methuen to take the unusual step of bringing out editions of the shooting scripts of The Private Life of Henry VIII (1934) and Jew S\u00fcss (1934), contributing introductions to both volumes. These were amongst the first publications that examined film scripts in their own right as works of literary merit."]}]}}
