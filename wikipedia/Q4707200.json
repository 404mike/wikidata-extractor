P. Nel, John Yapp, Richie Rees, Dimitri Basilaia, Ben Atiga, Greig Tonks, Izak van der Westhuizen, and Andy Titterrell. These arrivals were however tempered by the loss of several experienced internationals, Mike Blair, Chris Paterson, Jim Thompson, Alan MacDonald, Esteban Lozada and Phil Godman among them. However, after another poor start to the Pro12 League, Edinburgh were then beaten 0\u201345 by Saracens at Murrayfield in the first round of Heineken Cup matches. This was followed by another high-scoring defeat when the team lost 33\u20130 to Munster Rugby at Thomond Park."]}, {"page": "Macdonald", "response": ["* Alan MacDonald (rugby union) (born 1985), Scottish rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Alan McDonald", "response": ["Alan McDonald, Alan MacDonald, Allan McDonald, Allan MacDonald, Allen McDonald or Allen MacDonald may refer to:", "* Alan MacDonald (writer) (born 1958), English children's writer", "* Alan MacDonald (rugby union) (born 1985), Scottish rugby union player", "* Alsy MacDonald (Alan MacDonald, born 1961), Australian rock musician and lawyer", "* Alan MacDonald (production designer) (c. 1956\u20132017), British production designer"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh", "response": ["* Alan MacDonald (born 1985), rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2009 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["|OF ||7 ||Alan MacDonald"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|1017||MacDonaldAlan MacDonald||style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccffcc;\"|flanker||2009-11-28||v Argentina at Murrayfield"]}, {"page": "Alan MacDonald (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan MacDonald (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Edinburgh Rugby season", "response": ["*  Alan MacDonald"]}]}}
