The Air Corps who had supervised production expressed satisfaction with the end product. The critical response was equally enthusiastic and the film was widely praised for its realism and technical prowess, despite a superficial plot, \"an aviation picnic\" as Gene Brown called it. The combat scenes of the film were so realistic that one writer studying the film in the early 1970s was wondering if Wellman had used actual imagery of planes crashing to earth during World War I. One critic observed: \"The exceptional quality of Wings lies in its appeal as a spectacle and as a picture of at least some of the actualities of flying under wartime conditions.\" Another wrote: \"Nothing in the line of war pictures ever has packed a greater proportion of real thrills into an equal footage. As a spectacle, Wings is a technical triumph. It piles punch upon punch until the spectator is almost nervously exhausted\". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times praised the cinematography of the flying scenes and the direction and acting of the entire cast in his review dated August 13, 1927.

Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it \"quite a worthy pictorial offering with a genuinely fine and inspiring performance by Walter Huston in the role of the martyred President\" and later put it on his year-end list of the ten best films of 1930. \"More than an outstanding classic of sound pictures, Abraham Lincoln eclipses the most conservative illusion of a modernized Birth of a Nation\", wrote Variety in a rave review. \"It is a startlingly superlative accomplishment; one rejuvenating a greatest Griffith. In characterization and detail perfection it is such as to be almost unbelievable.\" Film Daily called it a \"distinguished and human narrative\" and wrote that Huston's performance \"may be listed as one of the 10 best of the year \u2013 or any talker year.\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that it was \"by and large.....a pretty high-grade picture.\" Despite these accolades, however, the film's box office performance was uneven."]}, {"page": "Dracula (1931 English-language film)", "response": ["The film was generally well received by critics upon its release.

Variety praised the film for its \"remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere\" and wrote, \"It is difficult to think of anybody who could quite match the performance in the vampire part of Bela Lugosi, even to the faint flavor of foreign speech that fits so neatly\". Film Daily declared the film \"a fine melodrama\" and remarked that Lugosi had created \"one of the most unique and powerful roles of the screen\". Time called it \"an exciting melodrama, not as good as it ought to be but a cut above the ordinary trapdoor-and-winding-sheet type of mystery film\". John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote a negative review, remarking that \"there is no real illusion in the picture\" and \"this whole vampire business falls pretty flat\". The Chicago Tribune did not think the film was as scary as the stage version, calling its framework \"too obvious\" and \"its attempts to frighten too evident\", but still concluded that it was \"quite a satisfactory thriller\"."]}]}}
