Following six months working at MGM in America, Newell came back to EMI in 1954, whereupon he recorded the comedians Norman Wisdom and Joyce Grenfell. Although Newell \"did not understand\" rock 'n' roll, he produced albums of the television shows Drumbeat and 6.5 Special.

Ure was injured in a car accident shortly after the release of the single, resulting in the cancellation of television appearances and a planned UK tour. \"Requiem\" opens with the first chords of Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo's \"Concierto de Aranjuez\", which had been a number 3 hit just two months before in the UK for Geoff Love's orchestra, billed as 'Manuel & the Music of the Mountains'.
