Shaw had already used her as inspiration for some of his plays before their first meeting in 1897 when he unsuccessfully tried to persuade \"Mrs Pat\" to play the role of Judith Anderson in the first production of his play The Devil's Disciple. Not until 1912, when they began negotiations for the London production of Pygmalion, did Shaw develop an infatuation for \"Mrs Pat\" that resulted in a passionate, yet unconsummated, love affair of mutual fascination and a legendary exchange of letters.Bernard Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell: Their Correspondence edited by Alan Dent, 1952 Alfred A Knopf It was Campbell who broke off the relationship  although Shaw was about to direct her in Pygmalion. They remained friends in spite of the break-up and her subsequent marriage to George Cornwallis-West, but Shaw never again allowed her to originate any of the roles he had written with her in mind (e.g. Hesione Hushabye (Heartbreak House), the Serpent (Back to Methuselah), etc.). When Anthony Asquith was preparing to produce the 1938 film of Pygmalion, Shaw suggested Campbell for the role of Mrs Higgins but she declined."]}, {"page": "James Agate", "response": ["Agate, the eldest child of Charles James Agate (1832\u20131909), a wholesale linen draper, and Eulalie Julia  n\u00e9e Young, was born in Pendleton, near Manchester, England.Ivor Brown, rev.

His father had a keen interest in music and theatre and connections with them. Gustave Garcia, nephew to the prima donna Maria Malibran, was Charles's lifelong friend after they were apprenticed together in the cotton warehouse. Agate's mother, educated in Paris and Heidelberg, was an accomplished pianist.Herbert Van Thal, ed., James Agate, an Anthology; introduction by Alan Dent, New York, Hill and Wang, 1961. Through Agate's family ties with the active German artistic community in Manchester, he had much exposure to performance in his youth. In October 1912, Sarah Bernhardt visited the Agate home, an indication of the family's position in the local arts.James Harding, Agate: a Biography London: Methuen, 1986. Agate's only sister, May, later studied acting under Bernhardt in Paris.", "Agate had a series of secretaries, of whom Alan Dent, known as Jock, served for 14 years and became the most prominent. Dent arrived on Agate's doorstep in September 1926: \"He announced that his name was Alan Dent, that he resided at some absurd place near Ayr, that he had received university education, hated medicine and refused to be a doctor, that he admired my work, intended to be my secretary willy-nilly, and had walked from Scotland for that purpose.

Writing in the Financial Times in 1980, Michael Coveney commented: \"A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays, partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species. Once the National Theatre has done its duty by Priestley and Rattigan and others teetering on the brink of theatrical respectability I suggest they employ Mr. Rix \u2026 to investigate the ignored riches of English farce between Travers and Ayckbourn.\"Coveney, Michael. \"Simple Spymen\", Financial Times, 11 August 1980, p. 9 Some London critics of the 1950s and 1960s did not disregard them, including Harold Hobson, Ronald Bryden, J.
