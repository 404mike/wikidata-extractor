He also played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire.\nHodges, a prop, was capped twice for England in the 1906 Home Nations Championship. He took part in their losses to Wales and Ireland. At club level, he played for Nottingham and while studying at Trinity College in 1908 was captain of the Oxford University RFC.\nIn 1911, he made his first-class cricket debut, against Derbyshire at the Miners Welfare Ground in Blackwell. He made his highest first-class score of 62 in his only innings, which the highest by a Nottinghamshire player in a low scoring match and bettered by only Derbyshire's Arthur Morton, who was the one that dismissed Hodges. The following year, he made two further appearances and finished his first-class career with 141 runs, at an average of 47.During World War I, Hodges served with the 3rd Battalion Monmouthshire Regiment. On the night of 22 March 1918, he entered a small factory on a road between Ham and Eppeville, hoping to make contact with a British battalion. He instead encountered enemy troops and was shot dead.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ronald Poulton", "response": ["Poulton's reputation as a rugby player preceded him at Oxford, but he knew before he arrived at Balliol in October 1908 that it was going to be difficult to get into the Oxford side, whose back line was filled with exceptional players. The only vacancy was given to Colin Gilray, who was a little older and arrived from New Zealand with a strong reputation. In his first term, Poulton played several games for Oxford, at first on the wing but then at centre. The penultimate fixture before the Varsity Match of 1908, was against Blackheath on 28 November. Being so close to the game against Cambridge, it was something of a trials match, and Poulton had a bad game at right centre. So Harold Hodges, Oxford's captain, opted for the centre pairing of Vassall and Frank Tarr, which had proven itself in 1906 and 1907."]}, {"page": "List of cricket and rugby union players", "response": ["| Harold Hodges"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|422||Harold Hodges||prop ||1906-01-13||v Wales at Richmond"]}, {"page": "Harold Augustus Hodges", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harold Hodges"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Harold Hodges"]}, {"page": "Frank Tarr", "response": ["With Oxford having won the Varsity Match in 1906 and again in 1907, Harold Hodges, the Oxford captain, was inclined to keep the winning three-quarter line for 1908, including the centre combination of Vassall and Tarr. One of that year's freshers was Tennant Sloan, a capped Scottish centre, who chose to try out for full back, realising that he was unlikely to be picked ahead of either of the incumbent centres. Vassall and Tarr had excellent ball handling skills, were quick around the field and fine decision makers; Tarr was also a formidable tackler. Ronnie Poulton played several games for Oxford ahead of the Varsity Match but it was clear that Hodges preferred the Vassall-Tarr pairing and Poulton only played when Vassall was injured, as he did in the 20\u20130 defeat of Richmond RFC. On 12 December, the 1908 Varsity Match resulted in a hard-fought 5\u20135 draw, the Cambridge pack having improved considerably since the previous year. As it turned out, Vassall's persistent ankle injury rendered him useless just five minutes into the game. The Times noted Tarr's performance saying: \"FN Tarr, at left centre three-quarter, gave a magnificent display of defensive play.\""]}, {"page": "Poulton's Match", "response": ["George Cunningham was Oxford's captain in 1909, taking over from Harold Hodges.
