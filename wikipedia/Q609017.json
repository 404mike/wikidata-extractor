Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over Rangers, but Ferguson was not happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a \"disgraceful performance\" in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted.Crick, p. 204", "Many of Ferguson's former players have gone on to become football managers themselves, including Tony Fitzpatrick, Alex McLeish, Gordon Strachan, Mark McGhee, Willie Miller, Neale Cooper, Bryan Gunn, Eric Black, Billy Stark, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Roy Keane, Paul Ince, Chris Casper, Mark Robins, Darren Ferguson, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Henning Berg, Andrei Kanchelskis, Michael Appleton, Ryan Giggs, David Healy, Gabriel Heinze, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, and Phil Neville.

Aberdeen's second League title was won in 1979\u201380, and this initial success was built on, with Scottish Cup wins in three successive seasons from 1982 to 1984, and two more league titles in 1983\u201384 and 1984\u201385.", "Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott.

In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994\u201395 season second-bottom, and had to rely on a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt for the first time in its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, hiring him as the club's chairman.", "* Willie Miller", "* Willie Miller (1972\u201390)", "|align=\"left\"|Willie Miller"]}, {"page": "Oor Wullie", "response": ["In 2019 Oor Wullie's BIG Bucket Trail 2019 was officially launched with 200 artistic interpretations of the figure at locations in cities across Scotland (for example, a statue wearing Willie Miller's football kit was installed in Aberdeen)Oor Wullie Miller sculpture returns home to Pittodrie, Evening Express, 30 August 2019 until 30 August, helping to raising money for Edinburgh Children's Hospital, Glasgow Children's Hospital and the Archie Foundation.

Scotland travelled to Spain in the summer of 1982 in what would be the only occasion Stein would manage a side at the finals of major international tournament. Scotland swept into a 3\u20130 lead in their first group game against New Zealand, but then careless defending saw the Kiwis stage a comeback, scoring twice. Scotland added a further two goals near the end to restore their three-goal advantage, but concern was raised at the potential repercussions of the two New Zealand goals should goal difference become a factor. Brazil were the next opponents, and Stein make a number of changes to his side. Danny McGrain and Kenny Dalglish were surprise omissions, whilst David Narey, Willie Miller and Steve Archibald came into the side. Graeme Souness took over the captaincy in McGrain's absence. Narey gave Scotland a shock lead when he opened the scoring with a powerful right-foot strike. Zico equalised just before half-time from a free kick, and then Brazil took control in the second half, scoring three times to send Scotland crashing to a 4\u20131 defeat. The final group game paired Scotland against the Soviet Union. The teams were level on two points each, but the Soviets had a better goal difference and this meant Scotland had to win. Joe Jordan came into the team for his first appearance at the 1982 World Cup, and he gave Scotland the lead in the first half, but the Soviets rallied and scored twice in the second half. The second goal was particularly galling for the Scots, and came as a result of defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding with one another, allowing Ramaz Shengelia a clear run in at goal to score. Souness netted a late equaliser for Scotland, but the game finished 2\u20132 and Scotland went out on goal difference. Stein commented after the final match: \"I am very disappointed we have not qualified. If we had played the way we did in any other section we would have gone through\", adding \"We have proved we can compete at this level, if not win.....
