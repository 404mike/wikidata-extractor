S. M\u00fcller, a Prussian from Danzig, curator of a museum in Bristol. He first studied painting under James Baker Pyne. His early pictures were mostly of the scenery of Gloucestershire and Wales, and he learned much from his study of Claude, Ruysdael, and earlier landscape-painters. He witnessed the 1831 Bristol riots and recorded some of the scenes in a series of \"raw and brilliant oil and watercolour sketches\". In 1833 he exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time, showing   Destruction of Old London Bridge-Morning. The next year he made a tour through France, Switzerland and Italy."]}, {"page": "Royal West of England Academy", "response": ["At first, the core of the Academy was a well-known group of artists in Bristol, known as the Bristol Society of Artists, who were mostly landscape painters, and many, such as William James M\u00fcller, Francis Danby, James Baker Pyne and John Syer were well known. In 1844, when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded, the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it. At this time the president and committee was predominantly its patrons, rather than its artists. In 1913 King George V granted the academy its Royal title, with the reigning monarch as its Patron, and by 1914 a major extension to the front of the building, including the dome and Walter Crane lunettes, was completed."]}, {"page": "Museo Poldi Pezzoli", "response": ["Painters in the collection include: Breughel the younger; Cranach; Goltzius; James Baker Pyne; Thomas Shotter Boys; Sutterman; Teniers the younger;  Jacob Toorenvliet; Pierre Tetar van Elven; Mathijs Van Hellemont; Jan Van der Meer II; Willem Van Mieris; Jacob Ferdinand Voet; Nicolaus Alexander Mair Von Landshut, (Mair Landshut); and Cornelis de Wael."]}, {"page": "George Arthur Fripp", "response": ["Fripp was born in Bristol, and educated in Bristol, Birmingham and Leamington.

This initially included William James M\u00fcller, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham, John Skinner Prout and Robert Tucker, according to Tucker's own account. The meetings later grew to include more artists, although relatively few surviving drawings have been identified, compared to the meetings of the 1820s, and by the 1830s the works of the Bristol School were less original. Other participants in the meetings probably included Samuel Jackson, Stephen C. Jones, James Baker Pyne, Henry Brittan Willis, W. Williams, Joseph Walter, George Arthur Fripp, Edmund Gustavus M\u00fcller, and William Evans. These sketching meetings may have lasted into the 1840s."]}, {"page": "Edward Villiers Rippingille", "response": ["In 1830 Rippingille left Bristol and travelled to France and Germany.
