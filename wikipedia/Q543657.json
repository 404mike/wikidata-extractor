Baker was a member of the Religious Society of Friends who had been involved in funding the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as well as becoming  head of Quaker Peace and Social Witness, and in his memoirs, Benenson described him as \"a partner in the launching of the project\".Benenson, P. (1983). Memoir In consultation with other writers, academics and lawyers and, in particular, Alec Digges, they wrote via Louis Blom-Cooper to David Astor, editor of The Observer newspaper, who, on 28 May 1961, published Benenson's article \"The Forgotten Prisoners\".  The article brought the reader's attention to those \"imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government\" or, put another way, to violations, by governments, of articles 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The article described these violations occurring, on a global scale, in the context of restrictions to press freedom, to political oppositions, to timely public trial before impartial courts, and to asylum. It marked the launch of \"Appeal for Amnesty, 1961\", the aim of which was to mobilize public opinion, quickly and widely, in defence of these individuals, whom Benenson named \"Prisoners of Conscience\". The \"Appeal for Amnesty\" was reprinted by a large number of international newspapers. In the same year, Benenson had a book published, Persecution 1961, which detailed the cases of nine prisoners of conscience investigated and compiled by Benenson and Baker (Maurice Audin, Ashton Jones, Agostinho Neto, Patrick Duncan, Olga Ivinskaya, Luis Taruc, Constantin Noica, Antonio Amat and Hu Feng).  In July 1961, the leadership had decided that the appeal would form the basis of a permanent organization, Amnesty, with the first meeting taking place in London. Benenson ensured that all three major political parties were represented, enlisting members of parliament from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the Liberal Party. On 30 September 1962, it was officially named \"Amnesty International\". Between the \"Appeal for Amnesty, 1961\" and September 1962 the organization had been known simply as \"Amnesty\".", "| Eric Baker Eric Baker", "In the British colony of Aden, a province in Yemen, a Swedish amnesty employee wrote a report on torture in a British prison. The report wasn't published by Amnesty. There were different allegations as to why it didn't get published. According to Benenson, Amnesty general secretary Robert Swann had suppressed it in deference to the Foreign Office. According to co-founder Eric Baker, both Benenson and Swann had met Foreign Secretary George Brown in September and told him that they were willing to hold up publication if the Foreign Office promised this wouldn't occur again. A memo by Lord Chancellor Gerald Gardiner, a labour politician, states that: Amnesty held the Swedish complaint as long as they could simply because Peter Benenson did not want to do anything to hurt a Labour government.Benenson then travelled to Aden and reported that he had never seen an \"uglier situation\" in his life. He then said that British agents had infiltrated Amnesty and repressed the report. Later, documents surfaced implicating Benenson had connections to the British government, which started the Harry letters affair. He then resigned, claiming that British and American intelligence had infiltrated Amnesty and subverted its values. After this set of events, which were dubbed by some the \"Amnesty Crisis of 1966-67\", the relationship between Amnesty and the British Government was suspended. AI vowed that in future, it \"must not only be independent and impartial but must not be put into a position where anything else could even be alleged\" and the Foreign Office cautioned that \"for the time being our attitude to Amnesty International must be one of reserve\"."]}, {"page": "Eric Baker", "response": ["Eric Baker may refer to:", "* Eric Baker (activist) (1920\u20131976), British activist founder of Amnesty International", "* Eric Baker (businessman) (born 1973), American businessman founder of Viagogo"]}, {"page": "South-East Essex Technical College and School of Art", "response": ["* Eric Baker (activist) (1920-1976) - General Secretary and a founder of Amnesty International; a founder of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament."]}, {"page": "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament", "response": ["The new organisation attracted considerable public interest and drew support from a range of interests, including scientists, religious leaders, academics, journalists, writers, actors and musicians.
