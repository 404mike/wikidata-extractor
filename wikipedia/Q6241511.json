In May 1754, Mannin took on a number of young Irish artists as apprentices with the Society, to teach them ornamental drawing and design. This first group included Hugh Douglas Hamilton. This was the first time in Ireland that design was formally taught and reflected the Society's mission to promote high quality design in Ireland. This was further cemented when Mannin became a salaried employee of the Society in May 1756 as the master of the school of ornament, a post he would hold until just before his death. During his tenure, he taught many Irish artists such as John James Barralet, George Mullins, and Thomas Roberts."]}, {"page": "Walter Robertson (artist)", "response": ["Robertson returned to Dublin, where he was declared bankrupt. This resulted in his property, a number of houses he had built on Great Britain Street, Cavendish Row, and North Strand, being sold at auction. He had relied heavily on his friend and fellow artist, Gilbert Stuart, for a steady supply of sitters but the 1792 suspension of parliament left Robertson with very few clients. Both Robertson and Stuart were in severe financial difficulties, and both left for the America in 1793. There is no record of what became of Robertson's family during this time. He initially lived with John James Barralet in Philadelphia and in 1794 he was commissioned to paint a portrait of George Washington. This portrait was also made into an engraving, and Robertson later painted portraits of Martha Washington and other notable American political figures. During this time he was known as the \"Irish Robertson\" to distinguish him from two Scottish miniaturists also called Robertson."]}]}}
