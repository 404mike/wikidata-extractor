Alexander McCulloch was himself the subject of a portrait called \"On His Holidays... Norway\" painted in 1901/1902 by John Singer Sargent. At the time the McCullochs, accompanied by John Singer Sargent, were on a salmon fishing holiday in Norway. John Singer Sargent originally painted Alexander in a standing position holding a landing net but decided the portrait looked too contrived. John Singer Sargent turned the canvas on its side and painted directly on top of the original portrait. Alexander is now portrayed laying his side at the side of a river in a more natural and relaxed pose. At the time of the portrait Alexander was a pupil at Winchester College, a Public School, and in the portrait the school tie can be seen serving as a belt for his trousers. The painting is now on display at the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Merseyside, England. It was acquired by Lord Leverhulme, along with several other paintings, shortly after the death of George McCulloch. Lord Leverhulme, who regarded \"On His Holidays...Norway\" as his favourite painting, had for a long time tried to have his own portrait painted by John Singer Sargent but without success.", "* Alexander McCulloch's scrapbook \u2013 containing many newspaper cuttings about the rowing events in 1908."]}, {"page": "List of South Australian House of Assembly by-elections", "response": ["|Alexander McCulloch"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of The Burra", "response": ["| Alexander McCulloch "]}, {"page": "Belton, South Australia", "response": ["The European settlement of the area which now forms the modern locality of Belton was first formalised as three cadastral hundreds when the area was opened up for pastoral purposes: the Hundred of Eurilpa, the Hundred of McCulloch, and the Hundred of Bendleby.
