He also studied at the universities of Munich, Berlin, and Paris. From 1919-20 he was Auditor of the Literary and Historical Society of UCD. His activities shortly after the formation of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies are affectionately satirized in Brian O'Nolan's poem Binchy and Bergin and Best, originally printed in the Cruiskeen Lawn column in the Irish Times and now included in The Best of Myles. He was a close friend of Frank O'Connor.\nHe served as Ireland's ambassador to Germany from 1929 to 1932. While there he received instruction from Rudolf Thurneysen which allowed him to begin his study of Early Irish Law. He was, for a time, the main academic investigating the legal system and for some time his ideas were the orthodoxy. While his contributions still underlie the foundations, some of his analysis, however, has since been reexamined. Many of his attempts to connect early Irish law to Celtic Law and even to Indo-European law have come under considerable doubt. However, his contributions are also lasting on account of his production of numerous translations and editions of legal texts. His final major work, the six volume Corpus Iuris Hibernici, collected almost all texts in the native Irish legal tradition, thus offering later scholars a firm ground to stand upon.Binchy was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962. He was the uncle of  the author Maeve Binchy and the academic William Binchy.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Serfdom", "response": ["In Gaelic Ireland, a political and social system existing in Ireland from the prehistoric period (500 BC or earlier) up until the Norman conquest (12th century AD), the  (\"hut-dweller\"),  (perhaps linked to , \"soil\") and  (\"old dwelling-house\") were low-ranked semi-free tenants similar to serfs.

Binchy, the laws were held to be conservative and useful primarily for reconstructing the laws and customs of the Proto-Indo-Europeans just as linguists had reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language. For instance, historians have seen similarities between Irish and Indian customs of fasting as a method of shaming a wrongdoer to recover a debt, or to demand the righting of a wrong. Other legal institutions prominent in early Irish law but foreign to most contemporary legal systems, such as the use of sureties, have been considered as survivals from earlier periods. More recently historians have come to doubt such attributions. While few historians argue that all Irish law comes from church influence, they are today much more wary as to what material is a survival and what has changed. A past may still be suggested for a certain legal concept based on Irish legal terms' being cognate with terms in other Celtic languages, although that information does not prove that the practice described by the legal term has not changed."]}, {"page": "Charleville, County Cork", "response": ["Later Irish speakers referred to the town as An R\u00e1th \"the rath\", a short form of the older Irish name.

After the 1920 local elections, Sinn F\u00e9in-dominated councils loyal to the self-proclaimed Irish Republic often sought to replace placenames having British monarchic allusions with older Gaelic names.

Certainly, if Scone was not associated with this kind of thing in Pictish times, the Scottish kings of later years made an effort do so. By the thirteenth century at the latest there was a tradition that Scone's famous inauguration stone, the Stone of Scone, had originally been placed at Tara by Sim\u00f3n Brecc, and only taken to Scone later by his descendant Fergus mac Ferchair when the latter conquered Scotland.Broun (2003), p. 194. Indeed, the prominence of such a coronation stone associated with an archaic inauguration site was something Scone shared with many like sites in medieval Ireland, not just Tara.See FitzPatrick (2003).
