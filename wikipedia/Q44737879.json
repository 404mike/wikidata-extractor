Collins opened the scoring for Luton in the sixth minute from LuaLua's low cross, before Nya Kirby equalised for the visitors with a 20-yard volley on 30 minutes. Collins was sent off after receiving two yellow cards in two second-half minutes, and after Blackpool took the lead through Matty Virtue, Cummings scored four minutes from time to bring the score to 2\u20132. Luton lost 3\u20131 away to Charlton Athletic, despite taking the lead in the 15th minute through Cornick with a shot into the top corner. Lyle Taylor scored twice during the second half for the home team, the first coming on 54 minutes with a penalty and the second coming on 72 minutes from a low shot, either side of Igor Vetokele's 70th-minute goal. The result ended Luton's run of 76 matches unbeaten in all competitions in which they scored the opening goal."]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["|23||Nya Kirby||AM|||| |||1||0", "| 11 January 2019 || AM ||  || Nya Kirby || Crystal Palace || 31 May 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["| 11 January 2019 || AM ||  || Nya Kirby || Blackpool || End of season || "]}, {"page": "2018 Panda Cup", "response": ["* Nya Kirby"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 22 January 2021 || CM ||  || Nya Kirby ||  Crystal Palace || End of season || "]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["| 22 January 2021 || CM ||  || Nya Kirby ||  Tranmere Rovers || End of season || "]}, {"page": "2021 EFL Trophy Final", "response": ["|MF ||16|| Nya Kirby"]}]}}
