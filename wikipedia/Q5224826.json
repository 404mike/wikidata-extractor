He is the currently men's soccer coach at St. Thomas University in New Brunswick.Cann was born in Torquay. He joined Torquay United as an apprentice, making his debut v Burnley in the 1986\u201387 season whilst still an apprentice as Torquay, managed by Stuart Morgan struggled to retain their place in the Football League. He turned professional in June 1987, but was released at the end of the following season having made 12 league appearances, scoring one goal. In 1987 Cann was selected to represent the FA Colts 11. While with Torquay, he also had a spell on loan with Weymouth.\nIn July 1988 he joined Barnstaple Town and embarked on a successful career in semi-professional football. He later played for Clevedon Town, joining Gloucester City in the 1994\u201395 season. He played 13 times for Gloucester and was sent off in his final game, away to Atherstone United, before joining Elmore. In the summer of 1995 he left Elmore to join Taunton Town's successful Western League side, winning a Championship medal in his first season. He played one Conference game for Bath City in December 1996, before leaving Taunton for Minehead Town in the summer of 1998.\nHe helped Minehead to promotion and the Western League First Division title before returning to Taunton Town in the 1999 close-season, also playing for Tiverton Town, Dartmouth A.F.C. and Newton Abbot in the Devon County Football League, when available and had also played for Penzance.
