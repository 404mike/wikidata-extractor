They meet a military unit led by Group Captain Gilmore and Sergeant Smith, tracking abnormal local magnetic fluctuations, originating mainly from Coal Hill School where a transmat device in its basement is tied to a Dalek ship in geostationary orbit. A second, weaker fluctuation is emitted by a grey Dalek in a nearby junkyard. Evidently, two Dalek factions are present: the Imperial Daleks on the orbiting mothership, controlling the school, and Renegade Daleks, who reject the Emperor's authority, controlling the junkyard. Both sides seek the Hand of Omega, a Time Lord device the Doctor left on Earth during his first visit to 1963.", "Smith is a secret associate of Ratcliffe, the leader of a group of fascists, reporting to a Renegade battle computer, which also uses a schoolgirl as its eyes and ears. The Doctor has the Hand buried in a local cemetery as a ruse, but it is soon unearthed by Ratcliffe, tipped off by Smith. Imperial Daleks arrive to seize it from the Renegades, but the Doctor and Ace defeat them and destroy their transmat. Anticipating a siege, the Doctor has Gilmore fortify the school while he disables the Renegade \"time controller\", leaving his calling card and fleeing with Daleks in pursuit, returning to the school just as the Imperial Daleks land. After losing the initial battles, the Imperials eventually defeat the Renegades after deploying a Special Weapons Dalek, wiping out all but a Supreme Dalek, allowing Ratcliffe and Smith to escape with the controller, pursued by the schoolgirl, who kills Ratcliffe.", "The Imperial Daleks take the Hand to the mothership, leaving for their home planet, Skaro. Ace follows Smith to recover the controller. The Doctor establishes communication with the Dalek Emperor, who is really their creator, Davros, who means to destroy the Time Lords with the Hand. The Doctor mocks him but then feigns fear. Davros launches the Hand, Skaro's sun goes supernova, and Skaro is destroyed, the force of the explosion also wrecking the mothership. The Hand returns to Gallifrey.", "Smith captures and attempts to kill Ace, but the schoolgirl finds them and kills Smith first. The Doctor persuades the Supreme Dalek to relinquish control of the girl, as, with Skaro gone, so is its purpose. The Supreme self-destructs, and the girl screams and faints, but is unharmed. At Smith's funeral, Ace asks the Doctor if what they have done was good, to which he responds: \"Time will tell\".", "Remembrance of the Daleks, the first story in Doctor Who twenty-fifth anniversary season, contains many intentional references to the series' past, something Aaronovitch felt was fun. The story is set in the same time and place as the programme's first episode, \"An Unearthly Child\", where Coal Hill School employed original companions Ian and Barbara and the Doctor's granddaughter Susan was enrolled. The Totter's Lane junkyard also reappears, as it had in season 22's Attack of the Cybermen, though \"I.M. Foreman\" is misspelled \"I.M. Forman\". It originally read \"L.M.\", though that was changeable in production. In one of the classrooms, Ace picks up a book on the French Revolution just as Susan had in \"An Unearthly Child\"; Aldred studied the original to try to mimic Carole Ann Ford's stature. The Doctor references the events of The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964), Genesis of the Daleks (1975), Terror of the Zygons (1975), and The Web of Fear (1968), as well as likening a device to something he used in Planet of the Daleks (1973). The Doctor mistakenly calls Captain Gilmore \"Brigadier\", a reference to the character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who headed UNIT, an organization similar to Gilmore's. Rachel, a scientific advisor from Cambridge, is similar to Liz Shaw, and she shares a conversation with Gilmore that is reminiscent of a conversation between the Brigadier and Liz in Spearhead from Space (1970). Rachel also bears a physical resemblance to Barbara. Remembrance of the Daleks is also notable for containing a meta-reference; a television continuity announcer says, \"This is BBC television, the time is quarter past five and Saturday viewing continues with an adventure in the new science fiction series Doc\u2014\", but is cut off by a scene change before completing the title. Aaronovitch \"couldn't resist\" the reference, and clarified that it was meant as a joke and was not to be taken seriously. Originally, it was intended that the show that was introduced would be called Professor X. In addition, Alison and Rachel make mention of a \"Bernard\" from the \"British Rocket Group\". This is a reference to Bernard Quatermass and his British Experimental Rocket Group, of the Nigel Kneale-penned Quatermass science-fiction television serials.", "Several scenes from Remembrance of the Daleks were cut or edited in production. McCoy's favourite scene, in which the Doctor muses to a worker at a caf\u00e9, was cut down by about half. As originally shot, Ace defused the tension between her and the Doctor when he left her at the boarding house. Also cut was the Doctor curing Ace's leg at the beginning of the third episode, and the issuing of instructions from the Dalek controller through an earpiece. A notable deleted line is the Doctor telling Davros that he is \"far more than just another Time Lord\". This, along with the Doctor's hints that he was present at the creation of the Hand of Omega, was part of the so-called \"Cartmel Masterplan\" by script editor Andrew Cartmel to restore some of the mystery to the Doctor's origins. However, as the programme ceased production in 1989, the intended revelations never came to pass. The original script also had the Doctor blowing up a Dalek with the anti-tank missile in episode two, but McCoy felt this was out of character and suggested Ace should do it instead.", "Remembrance of the Daleks was also the first story in which Aldred's Ace was a regular companion, having joined at the end of Dragonfire. Cartmel worked with Aldred to make Ace different from most companions: less of a \"screamer\" and more tomboyish. Aldred recalled that taking on the Daleks made her feel like a \"real assistant\". Aldred did many of her own stunts, bonding with the new stunt coordinator, Tip Tipping. She found the experience \"terrifying\" at first. Aldred has said that she is proud of the scene where Ace beats up a Dalek with a baseball bat, calling it one of the best things she has done in her life. Aldred was also trained in firing guns for the scene where she shoots a Dalek.", "The battle between the factions of Daleks has been likened to racism, which is apparent in the 1960s setting as Ace sees a sign that says \"No Coloureds\". The subtext was intentional, as Aaronovitch drew on the Daleks' Nazi theme and applied it to the setting. Cartmel was particularly proud of the scene and, when it was screened to BBC Head of Drama Mark Shivas, rewound the tape because Shivas had missed the sequence due to a phone call. Shivas felt that Ace should have torn the sign up, and Cartmel agreed it was a missed opportunity.", "Retrospective reviews have been mostly positive. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in The Discontinuity Guide, \"The best Doctor Who story in some considerable time, Remembrance of the Daleks reintroduced mystery and magic into the series with much intelligence and revisionist continuity\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn, despite noting that the production had not aged well visually, called Remembrance of the Daleks \"the Seventh Doctor era at its best\". He was positive towards how going back to An Unearthly Child allowed Aaronovitch and Cartmel to \"showcase their new, more devious master-planner version of the Doctor\", as well as the action and the character moments for Ace. DVD Talk's J. Doyle Wallis, reviewing the original DVD release, gave the story three and a half out of five stars, calling it \"a good ... adventure\" and noting the shift in the Doctor's personality. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 called Remembrance \"by a pretty wide margin the best anniversary special the show has ever done\", praising the return to the 1960s and the various continuity references.", "Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the serial for \"attempting to honour the programme's roots, even if, sadly, the effect is more of the present clomping all over the past\", and questioned how the Doctor could have known about the Daleks in 1963 if he did not meet them until he left. He was also critical of the supporting characters and McCoy and Ace; he felt McCoy \"struggles to convey gravitas\" in the changes that had been made to his character, and while Aldred brought \"gusto\", Ace was \"a peculiarly safe, middle-class rendering of a streetwise kid\". Mulkern wrote that the action scenes were handled well, but some of the Daleks looked \"fragile\" and destroying Skaro was double genocide. John Sinnot, reviewing the second DVD release on DVD Talk, also gave the serial three and a half out of five stars. He praised the action, references, and the Doctor's active involvement in the plot, but criticised the music and also questioned how the Doctor would have been able to plant the Hand of Omega for the Daleks. Sinnot also felt the Daleks acted \"stupid\" in some scenes, and wrote that the relationship between Ace and Mike was \"clumsy and awkward\". In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the first episode \u2013 in which the Dalek levitates up the stairs \u2013 as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of Doctor Who. However, Anders felt that the execution was \"pants, with Sylvester McCoy pulling some dreadful faces\". In 2013, Den of Geeks Andrew Blair selected Remembrance of the Daleks as one of the ten Doctor Who stories that would make great musicals."]}, {"page": "Doctor Who Magazine", "response": ["During 1995 Panini bought out Marvel UK, and thus took control of DWM.

When he creates characters, he initially assigns a character a name and fits attributes around it. In the case of Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in his inaugural series of Doctor Who, he chose the name because he considered it a \"good luck charm\" after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. He presented his desire to make the show \"essentially British\" as another justification: he considered Rose to be \"the most British name in the world\" and feminine enough to subvert the then-current trend of female companions and their \"boyish\" names, such as Benny, Charley, and Ace. While he was writing for The Grand, the executive producer requested that he change the female lead character's name, a decision that led to the \"character never [feeling] right from that moment on\". The surname \"Harkness\", most notably given to Torchwood lead Captain Jack Harkness, is a similar charm, first used in 1993 for the Harkness family in Century Falls, and ultimately derived from the Marvel Universe supporting character Agatha Harkness, and the surname \"Tyler\" is similarly used because of his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced."]}, {"page": "Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart", "response": ["Lethbridge-Stewart's last appearance in a Doctor Who television episode was in 1989, in the Seventh Doctor serial Battlefield.

The wedding is interrupted by the Master, who had stolen a Gallifreyan relic to build himself a new body, and had created a Fortean flicker to distract the Time Lords with improbable coincidences; however, his plan had backfired when the flicker caused the Doctor to coincidentally arrive to arrange Benny's wedding. The Master's backup plans are defeated with the help of Ishtar; the temporal energy she releases also rejuvenates the aging Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.

Authors sometimes added epilogues to their novelisations which were at odds with other material: The Curse of Fenric by Ian Briggs suggested a fate for Ace that differed from later original novels, and Philip Martin's adaptation of the Mindwarp segment of The Trial of a Time Lord included an ending that completely contradicted the scripted ending of the televised serial.", "In 1998 a video was released called Lust in Space in which the \"Time Assizes\" (Time Lords) put Doctor Who on trial for sexism.

Elgin gives her a DNA tag which would allow her to re-enter the library. Elgin shows the Doctor the amazing technological development housed at the library \u2014 the wetworks facility. The Doctor is not particularly impressed until Elgin reveals to him that it contains all the knowledge in the Universe. The Doctor comments that not even the Time Lords had made such a break through using that technology, which is why the Matrix was built.

After they have been brought back to the library, the Doctor leaves again to investigate the Ziggurat. However he does not realise the Ace left behind is in fact the duplicate. He discovers that the Ziggurat is in fact a Dalek hibernation unit, triggered to awaken the Daleks when the sound of the TARDIS was heard.

When Ace places Nitro-9 on the Wetworks facility, the test-subject fires at the Supreme to prevent it exterminating her. The Dalek Supreme retreats to its mother-ship leaving the Special Weapons Dalek to kill the test-subject, but the Nitro-9 succeeds in blowing up the machinery of the Wetworks, and the Kar-Charratians manage to escape.

The first wave of the line was composed of current Doctor Sylvester McCoy, already departed companion Melanie Bush (in a pink top), the Doctor's iconic ship the TARDIS, the Fourth Doctor's robotic pet dog K9 and a Tetrap monster from Time and the Rani. The first wave had numerous errors such as the TARDIS console featuring the wrong amount of sides and a green painted K9 as opposed to the correct metallic grey, apparently because the photo given by the BBC to Dapol gave the impression K9 was green as it allegedly reflected the grass. Half a year later a second wave of the first series was released featuring an Earthshock Cyberman, Dalek variants and the Fourth Doctor, surprisingly without his trademark long scarf and hat. The next batch of figures released in 1989 featured costume variants for the Doctor and Melanie, current companion Ace, an Ice Warrior story and a two-armed Davros. At first the way to readdress this mistake was simply to snap the offending hand off but later models took more care to readdress the balance. The final editions of this wave were three more Dalek colour variants. In 1990 the Dapol factory suffered serious fire damage and no new Doctor Who figures were produced until 1998. Dapol's third series of action figures mainly focused on the early 1970s era of the programme, including two types of Silurian, a Sea Devil, the Master as portrayed by Roger Delgado and the Doctor as portrayed by Jon Pertwee. The series also featured a Dalek based on the Peter Cushing film series and a gold Dalek from Day of the Daleks, which was only available in the Third Doctor box set. In 1999 Dapol released six more Daleks, the Melkur and two types of Sontaran. The next year Dapol discontinued the figure range and made 4-inch statues of the Second Doctor and a cyberman from The Moonbase. Though the company planned to continue this range with the First Doctor and a Yeti the BBC opted not to renew Dapol's licence. The company also hosted the Doctor Who Experience exhibition, which showed props and costumes from the original series and ran until 2003. Dapol also produced gift sets containing common figures, typically with one rarity included, and dozens of special edition Daleks, usually to coincide with the latest theme at the exhibition."]}, {"page": "Dust Breeding", "response": ["The Seventh Doctor's diary has a strange entry that the painting \"The Scream\" by Edvard Munch is going to be destroyed in \"mysterious circumstances\".
