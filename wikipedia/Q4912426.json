He was described as \"gutsy\" and as a \"stocky little battler\" and was the first ever footballer to sign for a club on live television.Dare was born in Willesden, London and started his footballing career with Hendon. He played only 10 games for Hendon, starting with his debut game on 11 September 1948 against Leyton, but managed eight goals. He joined Brentford in 1948, where he was teammates with Ron Greenwood. His Brentford debut came on 12 March 1949 against Luton Town. He made 208 league appearances and 222 in all competitions, before joining West Ham United for \u00a35,000 in 1955.A prolific goal scorer, Dare scored 52 goals in 125 games in all competitions for West Ham United. He made his Hammers debut on 5 March 1955 in a 2\u20131 home win against Leeds United. His first goal didn't come until two games later, on 19 March 1955, in a 2\u20131 home defeat of Middlesbrough. His 25 goals in all competitions in 1955\u201356 made him the club's highest scorer for that season.Dare, playing alongside Johnny Dick and Vic Keeble, played in the club's Second Division championship-winning season of 1957\u201358. Dare contributed 14 league goals, including one hat-trick in a 3\u20132 defeat of Bristol Rovers at Eastville on 31 August 1957, to a campaign in which West Ham scored 101 league goals. However, the now ageing forward struggled at the higher level, and Dare played only two games between February 1958 and April 1959 before his transfer in 1959.The 1959\u201360 season saw Dare play for Southern League team Yiewsley, where he played under Bill Dodgin, Sr. and later Jackie Milburn. He served as manager of Spartan League side Ruislip Manor in the mid-1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1958\u201359 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Dare"]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Billy Dare"]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. players", "response": ["| Billy Dare"]}, {"page": "Dare (name)", "response": ["*Billy Dare (1927\u20131994), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1956\u201357 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["West Ham finished eighth and were at no time in either of the top two, promotion places.

Amid much fanfare, former England international Tommy Lawton was signed for a club record \u00a316,000 fee in March 1952, but he managed to contribute only two goals in his 10 appearances.

Injuries and constant tinkering meant manager Gibbons had been unable to field a settled XI.", "A 4\u20130 win over Southampton on Boxing Day was the turning point. A new half back line was formed, with forwards Tony Harper and Jimmy Hill moving back to play alongside captain Ron Greenwood. Fred Monk, who had been converted into a full back, was re-deployed in his original forward position. Manager Jackie Gibbons also recruited football analyst Charles Reep in February 1951. Fred Monk, Billy Sperrin and Billy Dare scored regularly from mid-January 1951 through to the end of the season and helped the team secure a second-successive 9th-place finish.

Curtis elected to build for the future with the signings of young players Les Devonshire, Jimmy Anders, Micky Bull and Billy Dare, but Dare was the only one of the quartet who would go on to make an impact on the first team.

Centre half Ron Greenwood was bought from Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a39,000 in February 1949, with all of the money being recouped following the sale of captain Jack Chisholm to Sheffield United for \u00a316,000 a month later. Advanced preparations for the 1949\u201350 season continued in April, with the \u00a37,000 purchase of Jackie Goodwin and Wally Quinton from Birmingham City.
