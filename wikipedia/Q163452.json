His older brother, Robbie, is a professional welterweight boxer and former Welsh ABA Champion.\nAfter turning to rugby, he joined Merthyr RFC on the wing. After a successful year at Merthyr James joined Cardiff RFC at the start of the 2006\u201307 season. James scored 11 tries in just nine games to open the season which brought him to the attention of the first fifteen, with whom he had an academy contract. He was immediately put into the 22 man squad for the Cardiff Blues trip to Edinburgh in the Celtic League. He came off the bench midway through the second half and within minutes had marked his professional debut with a try.\nHis rise through Welsh rugby continued and during the 2006\u201307 season he joined the Wales Sevens team for a number of games. Following the 2006\u201307 season he was called up to the Welsh national squad for the summer tour of Australia, although he did not play a game on the tour.\nDuring the build up to the 2007 Rugby World Cup he was a part of the National Team's 40 man squad and made his debut for his country against England in August 2007. When the 40 man squad was cut to 30 at the end of August James was out and he returned to Cardiff Blues for the Magners League season. A slight knock kept him out of the first few games of the 2007\u201308 season. He came back shortly after the start, firstly playing a game for Cardiff RFC before starting the Blues away game against Munster in which he scored two tries. The following week he started again at home against Connacht and scored two more tries late on helping the Blues to a bonus point win.\nJames was top try scorer in the Magners League in the 2007\u201308 season.\nJames missed the first nine weeks of this season due to a groin injury. He scored a try in the final of the EDF Energy Cup at Twickenham on 18 April 2009 against Gloucester. He also scored the try that lead Cardiff to draw 26\u201326 in the Heineken Cup Semi-Final.\nOn 18 January 2010 he was named in the 35 man Wales national Squad for the 2010 Six Nations tournament.On 24 January 2013 it was announced that James had signed for Exeter Chiefs for the 2013\u201314 season.On 20 December 2014 it was announced that James had returned to the Cardiff Blues on a two-year deal.On 1 June 2015 James was included in the Welsh training squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and was included in the Welsh squad for the 2016 Six Nations Championship. He made what was to be his twelfth and final appearance for Wales in that year's Six Nations, against Scotland.\nAfter being released by the Blues at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, James signed for rival Welsh region the Scarlets. Towards the end of his second stint at the Blues, James revealed in an interview that he had been suffering from clinical depression which had caused him to miss a number of games.After a single season with the Scarlets during which injuries limited him to only two competitive appearances, James announced his retirement from professional Rugby at the end of the 2019\u201320 season. As of 2020 he remains the Blues' record try-scorer, with 60 tries scored.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhymney", "response": ["Notable people born in Rhymney include the Major League Baseball trainer John D.

And despite having become a well-known figure on the Lions tour, Roberts would also face stiff competition for a centre spot from new signings Casey Laulala and Gavin Evans alongside Dafydd Hewitt, who was returning from a long-term injury. The Blues lost their opening two matches to Edinburgh and Munster, with Roberts being rested. He then returned for the match with Connacht but only lasted till halftime with an ankle injury forcing him off. The Blues lost again 18\u201316. The following Monday, Roberts was cleared to play in the game against the Scarlets in the first Welsh derby of the season.
