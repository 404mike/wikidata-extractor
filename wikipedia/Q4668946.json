While at Hatton, he planned a new edition of Stephanus's Thesaurus Graecae Linguae. The work was undertaken by Abraham John Valpy, and, although not publicly stated, it was understood that Barker was the responsible editor. When a few parts had appeared, it was criticized in the Quarterly Review (xxii., 1820) by Edward Valentine Blomfield; the original plan of the work was then curtailed, and Barker's name was not used. It was completed in twelve volumes (1816\u20131828). The strictures of the Quarterly were answered by Barker in his Aristarchus Anti-Blomfieldianus, answered by James Henry Monk."]}, {"page": "Philar\u00e8te Chasles", "response": ["On his release he was sent to London, where he worked for the printer Abraham John Valpy on editions of classical authors. He wrote articles for the English reviews, and on his return to France did much to popularize the study of English authors. He was also one of the earliest to draw attention in France to Scandinavian and Russian literature. He contributed to the Revue des deux mondes, until he had a violent quarrel, terminating in a lawsuit, with Fran\u00e7ois Buloz, who won his case."]}, {"page": "Richard Valpy", "response": ["He was also the father of printer and publisher Abraham John Valpy and of New Zealand pioneer William Henry Valpy."]}, {"page": "George Dyer (poet)", "response": ["He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He edited the Delphin Classics, a 143-volume set of Latin works published by Abraham John Valpy at which task his editorial labors were so excessive as to induce near total blindness.  He also wrote poetry, and authored a number of tracts on the plight of England's poor and on reform of the political system."]}, {"page": "Periodical literature", "response": ["These examples are related to the idea of an indefinitely continuing cycle of production and publication: magazines plan to continue publishing, not to stop after a predetermined number of editions. A novel, in contrast, might be published in monthly parts, a method revived after the success of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens. This approach is called part-publication, particularly when each part is from a whole work, or a serial, for example in comic books. It flourished during the nineteenth century, for example with Abraham John Valpy's Delphin Classics, and was not restricted to fiction."]}, {"page": "Ad usum Delphini", "response": ["The Ad Usum Delphini series were reprinted for centuries and served in classrooms across Europe and the Americas.

Valpy spent much of his early life in Calcutta, where he worked as a judge. He retired to England in 1836, but poor health prompted him to emigrate with his family to healthier climes. They arrived in the new settlement of Otago only one year after its founding, in January 1849. William, with his wife Caroline (born 1804; n\u00e9e Jeffreys) travelled with five of their six children: artist Ellen Penelope Valpy Jeffreys, Catherine Henrietta Elliot Valpy Fulton (who became a suffragist), Arabella Valpy (who was instrumental in bringing the Salvation Army to New Zealand), Juliet Valpy, and William.
