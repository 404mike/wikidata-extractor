His first appearance of the season came in the opening match, a 1\u20131 draw away to Stevenage Borough on 8 August 2009. Smith's first goal of the season came after scoring a powerful header in a 2\u20131 home victory over Wrexham on 25 August 2009. In October 2009, he paid tribute to the defensive partnership he had struck up with Michael Briscoe, saying: \"Football is about partnerships on the pitch, having trust in team-mates and good understandings and we seem to have one.\" Smith suffered a heel injury in October 2009, while also having a hernia problem that possibly needed an operation. After having a hernia operation, he was expected to be ruled out for a long-term period, but returned two weeks later in the following match, a 3\u20131 home win over Chester City on 14 November 2009. He was handed a one-match suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season in a 0\u20130 home draw with Forest Green Rovers on 28 December 2009, meaning he missed Tamworth's match against Oxford United on 16 January 2010. His return came in a 0\u20130 draw away to Gainsborough in the FA Trophy second round on 19 January 2010. After receiving a yellow card in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Histon on 9 March 2010, he was given a two-match suspension, returning in a 2\u20130 away defeat by Cambridge United on 24 March. He scored from close range in the 82nd minute for Tamworth's equalising goal in his first match against York since leaving the club, which finished a 1\u20131 away draw on 27 March 2010. Smith made 38 appearances and scored four goals in 2009\u201310."]}, {"page": "Briscoe, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Briscoe"]}]}}
