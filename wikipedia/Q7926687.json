The nexus has been accused of resisting and restricting financial settlements because it is too closely affiliated with the Church itself. Research carried out in Companies House revealed the extent of these grants. It has been estimated that between 2014-2020 the Church of England will receive in the region of \u00a3100 million via Allchurches Trust. The search for information on Companies House also revealed that in addition to the senior church figures who have been trustees of Allchurches Trust, numerous bishops and cathedral deans have been directors on the board of Ecclesiastical itself.
