The eliminated intermediate stops were at Lawrence Avenue and Sheppard Avenue. However, subsequently the cost estimate for the one-stop subway extension increased to $3.2billion leaving the Crosstown East LRT unfunded. Given the rising cost for the subway extension and the loss of funding for the LRT line, a group of city councillors led by Josh Matlow reopened the subway versus LRT debate. Matlow proposed scrapping the one-stop subway extension in order to provide funding for 24 LRT stops on two LRT lines within Scarborough. TTC CEO Andy Byford said the cost of the LRT line following the Line 3 route may have risen to as high as $3billion because of \"delays and redesign\" since 2013, but Brad Ross also of the TTC warned of \"caveats around numbers and assumptions\" associated with that estimate. After Council's vote, Byford admitted that the cost estimates for \"delays\" was unnecessary, which assumed the LRT's completion would be in 2026, the same date as the subway option. However, according to Michael Warren, a former TTC chief general manager, the LRT could have been completed in 2020 at a cost of $1.8billion, an estimate not presented to City Council when it voted. There was also the issue whether there would be space for both expanded GO service and an LRT north of Kennedy station; however, Metrolinx subsequently denied there would be such a problem.

Where possible, the agency has sought to increase speed limits. In summer 2018, New York City Transit president Andy Byford created the SPEED Unit to reduce delays by modifying operating and service practices. Soon after, the MTA began testing timers as part of the first systemwide review of timers to determine whether they are allowing trains to run at the posted maximum speed. The MTA eventually identified 267 faulty timer signals that disallowed trains from proceeding at the speed limit, and thus, forced trains to run significantly slower than intended. Train operators that pass the signals at or near their posted speeds have gotten punished due to the agency's strict discipline culture even though the signals are malfunctioning. Byford stated that \"I don't think that safety and speed are incompatible.\" By December 2018, the SPEED Unit had found 130 locations where the speed limit could be increased, some of which were in the process of being fixed. It was also announced that speed limits would be doubled in some parts of the system, and that average speeds would generally be increased from  to .

In March 2018, the MTA announced that four entities had submitted two winning proposals to the challenge. One of the proposals used ultra-wideband signaling technology. The other proposal entailed installing sensors and cameras on trains, with minimal installations on tracks. New York City Transit Chairman Andy Byford stated that he wanted to test ultra-wideband technology at the same time that more established systems, like CBTC, are being installed. In March 2019, contracts for UWB installation on the Canarsie and Flushing Lines were awarded. Four trains on each line were equipped with UWB.
