Iago helps Uvanov solve a series of murders involving Company board members, and his success earns him a permanent position as Uvanov's new bodyguard. However, as the title hints, the simplest explanation is true: Iago has been committing the murders himself, and framing another board member, in order to gain Uvanov's trust.Occam's Razor", "Following the release of this play, and the death of Russell Hunter, it was generally assumed that the Kaldor City audios had reached a natural end.The Pictures are Better on the Radio, Jules Jones, 3 May 2004 ", "The final play in the series is Storm Mine by Daniel O'Mahony. It centres on the character of Blayes, who awakens on a storm mine going round in circles in the desert.

The story at first glance seems to bear no real connection to the series as a whole, although it is suggested that Kaldor City itself is quarantined due to the killer robots. However, there are several hints within the play that all is not as it seems \u2014 for example, several of the characters bear similarities to characters from earlier plays, such as Philip Madoc's Commander sharing mannerisms with Russell Hunter's Uvanov, himself once a storm mine Commander. The Fendahl also appears in the play, apparently manipulating the crew and one of its robots for its own ends, and it has been suggested that in fact the play is demonstrating what it feels like for the characters to be assimilated into the Fendahl's gestalt entity.Storm Mine"]}, {"page": "Taggart", "response": ["* Russell Hunter (Episode: Death Comes Softly)"]}, {"page": "Play of the Month", "response": ["|Jeremy Brett,Pauline Collins,Edward Fox,Bernard Lee,Arthur Lowe,Andrew Robertson,Colin Jeavons,Russell Hunter,John Rhys-Davies,Richard Kane,David Kincaid,Willie Shearer"]}, {"page": "Callan (TV series)", "response": ["| colspan=\"4\" | Russell Hunter", "ABC commissioned a first series of six episodes in 1967.
