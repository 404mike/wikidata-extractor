A PhD student of Professor Richard Gilbert West in the Subdepartment of Quaternary Research, University of Cambridge (1971\u20131974), he investigated the diversion of the River Thames from its course through Hertfordshire to its present course through London. Later he established the stratigraphy and palaeogeography of the Thames in the Middle (1985) and Lower Thames Valley (1994). He has since undertaken many collaborative, palaeoenvironmental investigations. This multidisciplinary approach has led to him working throughout Britain, offshore areas, especially the North Sea, English Channel and the formation of the Strait of Dover, and neighbouring countries. For an example of this work, see Britain's island heritage: reconstructing half a million years of history.He spent 2 years in the University of Oulu, Finland (1974-6) and 1 year at the University of Western Ontario, Canada (1976\u20131977) as a post-doctoral worker before returning to Cambridge as a Post-doctoral Research Associate, and later as a Senior Post-Doctoral Research Associate, and was appointed to the University of Cambridge's staff as an Assistant Director of Research (in 1984).\nIn 1995 he and his research group were transferred to the University's Department of Geography. He was also appointed Docent in the Department of Geology, University of Helsinki, Finland in 1987.Through co-operation with J\u00fcrgen Ehlers, his interest in glaciation has led to the publication of seven books. Most recently they were joint co-ordinators of an INQUA Commission on Glaciation workgroup which compiled an atlas of world Quaternary glaciation limits (see below Ehlers & Gibbard, 2004 a, b, c). He is also interested in the application of stratigraphical principles and chairs the International Commission on Stratigraphy Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy.Phil Gibbard was awarded the Geological Society's Lyell Fund prize in April 1999 'for excellence in Quaternary geology'.  In 2010 Phil was awarded an honorary doctorate degree (PhD (honoris causa) by the University of Helsinki and a ScD degree in July 2009 by the University of Cambridge.His publications include over 280 papers, 20 books, 8 charts and numerous reports and reviews.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthropocene", "response": ["Recently, a group of geologists, archaeologists, environmental scientists and geographers, including current ICS Secretary General Phil Gibbard, have proposed to recognize the Anthropocene as an ongoing geological event analogous to the Great Oxidation Event, rather than as an epoch in the GTS."]}, {"page": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge", "response": ["* Phil Gibbard"]}, {"page": "Phil Gibbard", "response": ["Phil Gibbard was awarded the Geological Society's Lyell Fund prize in April 1999 'for excellence in Quaternary geology'.Geological Society   In 2010 Phil was awarded an honorary doctorate degree (PhD (honoris causa) by the University of HelsinkiPromotion citation details and a ScD degree in July 2009 by the University of Cambridge.University of Cambridge home page"]}, {"page": "Philip Leonard Gibbard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Phil Gibbard"]}, {"page": "Gibbard", "response": ["*Phil Gibbard (born 1949), Professor of Quaternary Palaeoenvironments, University of Cambridge"]}]}}
