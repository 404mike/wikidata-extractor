He was educated at Harrow School and in 1914 scored 59 against Eton at Lord's. He was due to go to Oxford University, but shortly after the outbreak of World War I, he was commissioned into the Derbyshire Yeomanry in October 1914. He served as a captain at Salonica in January 1918, and was awarded the Military Cross. He was also mentioned in despatches twice and also won the French Legion d\u2019Honneur and the War Cross (Greece). Jackson was leading his troops on patrol when some Bulgarian soldiers approached, carrying a flag of truce. They were asking for the armistice, which was to end Bulgaria's part in the First World War.After the war, Jackson returned to Derbyshire and made his first-class debut for the county in the 1919 season in July. He scored five and six in a low-scoring match against Somerset in which Derbyshire was bowled out for 37 in their second innings, losing by three wickets. In the 1922 season, he was appointed captain of the team which George Buckston had started to develop and he remained Derbyshire's captain for nine seasons. He quickly won the respect of his players and in his first season as captain, Derbyshire moved up to finish 11th, winning six games. Billy Bestwick led the bowling, although Derbyshire's batting was disappointing. By the 1927 season, Derbyshire had risen to fifth in the County Championship.In the winter of 1926\u201327, Jackson had toured South America with a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) party, which was captained by Plum Warner . In a game against Argentina in Buenos Aires which MCC won by an innings and 12 runs, Jackson hit 73 his highest score of the tour. In 1927-28 was appointed captain of the MCC party to tour South Africa but was unable to tour because of ill health.After leading Derbyshire in 220 matches, Jackson gave up the club captaincy at the end of the 1930 season, handing over to Arthur Walker Richardson who took the team to the top. Jackson played occasionally until the 1936 season, his final first-class appearance for Derbyshire being in July against the Indian tourists in a rain-affected draw. From 1942 to 1960 he was chairman of Derbyshire's committee. He became joint managing director of Clay Cross Co. He died at Chesterfield.\nJackson's brother Geoffrey Jackson and cousin, Anthony Jackson, also played cricket for Derbyshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Guy Jackson (1896\u20131966), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "Billy Bestwick", "response": ["In 1919 44-year-old Bestwick was invited to rejoin Derbyshire in a revitalised Derbyshire team, and with Arthur Morton as his minder.

He played six games in 1921 when under Guy Jackson the team moved up to 12th in the Championship. In 1922 he played two games for Cambridge University and twelve games for Derbyshire who reached 11th in the championship,  accompanying Wilfred Hill-Wood in both teams. In 1923 he played two games for Derbyshire and  ten for Cambridge University culminating in the Varsity match which that year, was nicknamed the \"Thunderstorm match\". Oxford ran up a high score before overnight storms created a very sticky wicket and the Cambridge team which included Gubby Allen and Claude Ashton were quickly dismissed in two innings. Tomlinson played one game for Derbyshire in 1924 and then stayed with club cricket. He was a right-arm medium pace bowler and took 58 first-class wickets with an average of 32.24 and a best performance of 5-53.
