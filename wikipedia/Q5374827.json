He spent his youth travelling widely, visiting Egypt, Morocco, Central Africa, India, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, China, Japan, and the United States. Like his father, the founder of the Horniman Museum, he was an enthusiastic collector of arts and \"curiosities\".In 1898 he was elected to the London County Council to represent Chelsea. A member of the majority Liberal-backed Progressive Party, he was re-elected in 1901 and 1904.At the 1906 general election Horniman was chosen to contest the parliamentary constituency of Chelsea by the Liberals. There was a large swing to the party, and he was elected, unseating the Conservative MP, Charles Whitmore. He served only one term in the Commons, losing the seat to Conservative opponent, Samuel Hoare, in January 1910.In 1911 he laid out and donated a public park in north Kensington to the London County Council, since known as Emslie Horniman's Pleasance.Horniman inherited the Horniman's Tea company founded by his grandfather, and in 1912 purchased Burford Priory, Oxfordshire from Colonel Frank de Sales la Terri\u00e8re. He sold Horniman's Tea in 1918 to rival J. Lyons & Co..\nHe married Laura Isabel Plomer, and the couple had three children. He died at his London residence on Chelsea Embankment in July 1932.
