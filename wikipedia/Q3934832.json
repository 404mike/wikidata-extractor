The departure of Simon Moore to Cardiff City and injury to Richard Lee saw Button begin the season as manager Uwe R\u00f6sler's first-choice goalkeeper. Button started each of Brentford's opening six league games, but disaster struck on 7 September against Bradford City when with the score at 0\u20130, Button received a straight red card for a challenge on Bradford player Nahki Wells just outside the penalty box after 26 minutes. During his three-match suspension, Jack Bonham and then the fit-again Richard Lee took over the goalkeeping position. Button made his next appearance in a 1\u20130 defeat to Rotherham United on 5 October and regained his position as first-choice goalkeeper. An open forum between players and management in the dressing room after a 2\u20131 defeat to Stevenage on 12 October saw a turnaround in the team's fortunes and the beginning of a run of nine consecutive wins in the league, with Button appearing in eight of those matches and keeping seven clean sheets. With Button as a virtual ever-present, the Bees secured automatic promotion to the Championship after a 1\u20130 win over Preston North End on 18 April 2014. Button made 45 appearances and kept 20 clean sheets in league matches during the 2013\u201314 season.

His performances against Huddersfield Town and Ipswich Town in March 2015 saw him selected in the Football League Team of the Week. A successful second season at Griffin Park for Button ended after Brentford's 5\u20131 playoff semi-final aggregate defeat to Middlesbrough. He made 49 appearances, keeping 11 clean sheets in league matches. Button was again first choice during the 2015\u201316 season, featuring as an ever-present in league matches and talks began over a new contract in May 2016. The talks broke down and he departed Brentford on 19 July 2016, having made 141 appearances during three seasons with the club."]}]}}
