The Dutchman soon secured Ferguson on a long-term contract as he became an important member of the squad. He scored his first career goal in a League Cup match against Alloa Athletic on 18 August 1998, and played against his brother on three occasions during that season when Rangers faced Dunfermline Athletic, with a 20-year-old Ferguson scoring his first league goal in the match at East End Park. His brother, then 31 years old, made his last appearance at Ibrox in the reverse fixture. Injury prevented him from being involved in the 1998\u201399 season run-in as the club achieved the treble; Ferguson watched the 1999 Scottish Cup Final from the stands as Rangers won by a single goal, scored by Rod Wallace three minutes into the second half."]}, {"page": "Bob Malcolm", "response": ["Malcolm signed for Queensland-based A-League team Brisbane Roar in July 2009 where former Rangers teammates Craig Moore and Charlie Miller played at the time."]}, {"page": "Charles Miller", "response": ["* Charlie Miller (North Carolina politician), member of the North Carolina House of Representatives", "* Charlie Miller (pinch hitter) (1877\u20131951), Major League Baseball player", "* Charlie Miller (shortstop) (1892\u20131972), Major League Baseball player", "* Charlie Miller (born 1976), Scottish footballer", "* Charlie Miller (security researcher), known for identifying Apple product security flaws"]}, {"page": "Antti Niemi (footballer)", "response": ["Niemi moved to Edinburgh to join Heart of Midlothian in December 1999. He became a hero for Hearts fans in the three years he played at Tynecastle. He put in some fantastic performances which helped Hearts maintain their status as Scotland's best team outside the Old Firm. Niemi also became famous in Scotland for his ability to save penalties, demonstrating this skill when saving from Dundee United's Charlie Miller and Dunfermline Athletic's Scott Thomson. Niemi also played in European competition for Hearts against opponents such as Stuttgart."]}, {"page": "Robbie Winters", "response": ["After leaving in 2002 when his contract expired, Winters played one match for Luton Town, appearing in the first half of the first match of the season, before moving to Norway with Brann. After several seasons with hints about leaving Bergen due to family issues, Winters stated on 31 October that he no longer had the motivation needed to play for SK Brann, and that he wished to leave the club in January. He was seeking a club, preferably in Scotland, but he also stated that an English Championship club would be interesting. With no contract offer, Winters returned to SK Brann to make peace with manager Mons Ivar Mjelde and fulfil his contract until December 2007.

Postecoglou's first season ended as the worst in the club's short history, finishing second from the bottom. Postecoglou completed a turn-around in the 2010\u201311 season. He made wholesale changes to the squad, commencing with the replacement of the \"old-guard\" of Charlie Miller, Craig Moore and Danny Tiatto and brought in his own squad which was a mixture of youth and talented experience. Under his brand of possession/attacking football, he led the team to win the club's inaugural premiership and go on to complete the club's first Double by also wrapping up the championship in a memorable 2011 A-League Grand Final in front of a then club record 50,168 supporters. The club went on an Australian sporting record 36-match unbeaten run which commenced in the 2010\u201311 season and ran through to the 2011\u201312 season. After much speculation on his future at the club, it was reported that Postecoglou had signed a three-year contract extension."]}]}}
