He has been much involved in radio broadcasting and in the educational sector, in creative writing and literary mentoring.  He has generated many educational resources that incorporate creative writing, science and ecology. Petrucci's poetry has also been deployed in a number of films. For instance, Heavy Water: a film for Chernobyl and Half Life: a Journey to Chernobyl were based on his award-winning poetry collection on Chernobyl. Produced by Seventh Art Productions, these films have garnered awards such as the Cinequest as well as screenings on mainstream television and at major cultural venues such as Tate Modern (in 2007).  2012 saw Petrucci shortlisted for the Ted Hughes Award\n with a vast poetry soundscape (among the largest ever created) entitled Tales from the Bridge. \nThis installation spanned the Thames (on the Millennium Bridge, London) as part of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad.

Starting from the observation that poetry can usually be told from prose simply by looking at it, this reading of Spatial Form encompasses the many aspects of subtle visual significance that are held, for instance, by typeface or in the textures of repeated letters, as well as the more overt visual signals generated by the poem\u2019s layout.Writing In Education, National Association of Writers in Education, issue 40 (2006), pp.37-40."]}, {"page": "English poetry", "response": ["There has been recent activity focused on poets in Bloodaxe Books' The New Poetry, including Simon Armitage, Kathleen Jamie, Glyn Maxwell, Selima Hill, Maggie Hannan, Michael Hofmann and Peter Reading.
