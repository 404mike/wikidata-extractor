Well known for championing new music, Currie has premiered works by composers such as Elliott Carter, Louis Andriessen, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Jennifer Higdon, Kalevi Aho, Rolf Wallin, Kurt Schwertsik, Simon Holt, Alexander Goehr, Dave Maric, Julia Wolfe and Nico Muhly. Currie leads percussion ensemble The Colin Currie Group which performs the music of Steve Reich. He has made a number of recordings of contemporary percussion concerti and recorded a solo album, Borrowed Time', on the Onyx label. His recording of Jennifer Higdon's Percussion Concerto won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition.", "In January 2011 Currie was appointed as an Artist in Residence at London's Southbank Centre and still holds the position. In recent seasons, Currie has been a central figure in festivals hosted by the Southbank Centre. In autumn 2013 as part of the festival The Rest is Noise, Currie and members of the Colin Currie Group performed works by Stockhausen and Steve Reich, which Guy Dammann of The Guardian praised for being \"technically impeccable and musically overwhelming\". In 2014, The Southbank Centre presented Metal Wood Skin, a percussion festival dedicated to Currie. The festival included a number of new commissions, including the world premiere of Reich's Quartet for two vibraphones and two pianos and the UK premiere of Louis Andriessen\u2019s Percussion Concerto, Tapdance, alongside new works by James MacMillan and Anna Clyne. De Doelen in Rotterdam have appointed Currie as their Red Sofa Artist, a role that involves collaboration with Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and other artists. During this time, Currie is set to debut more compositions, including new works by Dave Maric and Reich."]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1970 in jazz, deaths of Albert Ayler, Barney Rapp, Billy Stewart, Booker Ervin, Cliff Jackson, Don Stovall, Elmer Schoebel, Emile Barnes, Fernando Arbello, Frankie Lee Sims, Jack Sels, Johnny Hodges, Lem Davis, Lonnie Johnson, Maxwell Davis, Otto Hardwick, Perry Bradford, Phil Spitalny, Ralph Escudero, and Scoops Carry; births of Adam Cruz, Adam Piero\u0144czyk, Alvester Garnett, Andreas Paolo Perger, Anna Maria Jopek, Anna Mj\u00f6ll, Avishai Cohen, Bernardo Sassetti, Brad Mehldau, Brian Blade, Chris Fryar, Chris Tarry, Craig Taborn, Dave Maric, Dominic Green, Dwayne Burno, Eldbj\u00f8rg Raknes, \u00c9ric Legnini, Eric Reed, Erik van der Luijt, Frank McComb, Geoffrey Keezer, Giovanni Mirabassi, Glenn Corneille, Gregory Hutchinson, Harald Johnsen, H\u00e5vard Lund, Haydain Neale, Heine Totland, Iiro Rantala, Ingrid Laubrock, Jacob Karlzon, Jacob Young, Jeremy Davenport, Jesper Bodilsen, Jesse Harris, Jimmy Bennington, Juliet Kelly, Justin Hayford, Karen Souza, Kate McGarry, Keith Anderson, Kishon Khan, Kjersti Stub\u00f8, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Lina Nyberg, Live Maria Roggen, Lullaby Baxter, Manuel Mota, Marco Minnemann, Maria Kannegaard, Marlon Jordan, Matt Garrison, Matt Lavelle, Michael Schiefel, M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Collignon, Michel Bisceglia, Neil Yates, Norman Brown, Peter Martin, Roger Cicero, Ron Westray, Simone Eriksrud, Susanne Abbuehl, Susie Ibarra, Tobias Sj\u00f6gren, Toby Smith, Tom Brantley, Tone Lise Moberg, Tord Gustavsen, and Yinka Davies."]}]}}
