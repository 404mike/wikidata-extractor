Formerly an honorary research fellow in The Department for Science and Technology Studies (STS) at University College London (UCL), he is the author of several books, including Gardening and Planting by the Moon (an annual series beginning in 1980), Newton's Forgotten Lunar Theory (2000), Crop Circles (2002), and Terror on the Tube (2009). He has also written entries for the Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers.\nKollerstrom has been involved in a variety of issues as a political activist. In 1986 he co-founded the Belgrano Action Group after the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano by the Royal Navy during the Falklands War, and from 2006 he argued that the 7 July 2005 London bombings were not carried out by the men accused of them. UCL withdrew his fellowship in 2008 in response to his views about the Auschwitz concentration camp, which he posted on a Holocaust-denial website.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1946", "response": ["** Nicholas Kollerstrom, British writer"]}, {"page": "Later life of Isaac Newton", "response": ["* Newton's Lunar Theory.

Airy's role as the hidebound superior willfully ignoring the upstart young intellect was, according to Kollerstrom, largely constructed after the planet was found, in order to boost Adams's, and therefore Britain's, credit for the discovery.
