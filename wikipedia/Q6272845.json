He went straight into their league team at right half with Jonathan Cretney at centre half, displacing Fred Barron from the half-back line to right back. After the first match, Cretney and Cawthorne changed places, and Cawthorne continued in his preferred centre-half position until the turn of the year, when he lost his place through injury and, following the arrival of the ageing but still influential former England international centre half Alex Leake, did not regain it. He was not retained at the end of the season, and returned to Clitheroe Central. By the end of November 1907, his standard had \"greatly improved\", according to the Lancashire Daily Post, and Burnley re-signed him. He remained on their books for the next two-and-a-half seasons, but appeared only rarely for their first teamthree times in the 1908\u201309 season and once in 1909\u201310."]}, {"page": "Cretney, Jonathan", "response": ["#redirectJonathan Cretney"]}, {"page": "Cretney", "response": ["*Jonathan Cretney  (1879\u20131956), British footballer "]}]}}
