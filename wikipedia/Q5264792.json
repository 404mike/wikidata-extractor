Saunders was also production controller for Joe 90 and co-wrote one of the episodes, \"Lone-Handed 90\". He briefly worked as a production supervisor for The Secret Service (1969).\nElsewhere in television, Saunders had both production and post-production roles for The Protectors (1972\u201373).\nHis film editing credits are: RX for Murder (1958), A Woman's Temptation (1959), Escort for Hire (1960), Compelled (1960), Tarnished Heroes and So Evil, So Young (both 1961) and Voyage of the Damned (1976). He was sound editor for Floods of Fear (1959).While working on puppet series for Anderson, the A.P. Films team received constant requests to make the puppets more real. Once, Saunders chose all of the male puppets and put little penises on them. When the girls came in during the morning, there was, as Saunders describes, \"the most terrible uproar\". In response, he said: \"Well, you know, you gotta bring them to life somehow, haven't you?\".He died on 21 April 2018 at the age of 91.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Supermarionation", "response": ["Not all of Anderson's colleagues welcomed the change. Puppet sculptor and operator John Blundall pejoratively referred to the new puppets as \"little humans\" that lacked the personality of their precursors, also stating that the increased emphasis on realism hampered the puppeteers' creativeness. Fellow sculptor Terry Curtis believed that the re-design took away the puppets' \"charm\". According to director Desmond Saunders, APF was trying \"anything to get [the puppets] to look like ordinary human beings. But they are not ordinary human beings! ... I often wonder it if would have been better to make them more like puppets, not less like puppets.\" A drawback of the smaller heads was that they upset the weight distribution; this made the puppets harder to control, to a point where they would often have to be fixed to G-clamps to be kept steady.La Rivi\u00e8re 2014, pp.\u00a0264-265. In addition, problems achieving realistic depth of field made it considerably harder to film close-up shots."]}, {"page": "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons", "response": ["By the time Captain Scarlet entered production, many of the directors on earlier Anderson series \u2013 including Alan Pattillo, David Elliott and David Lane \u2013 had either left the company or were committed to the production of Thunderbird 6, the second Thunderbirds feature film. Although Lane, Brian Burgess and Desmond Saunders were able to reprise directorial duties for at least one episode each, the Andersons were forced to promote some of the junior production personnel to replace the outgoing directors. To this end, Alan Perry and Ken Turner were promoted from the camera operator and art departments.Bentley 2001, p.\u00a032. Other directors were recruited from outside the company; among them was Robert Lynn, who had been assistant director on films including Black Narcissus, Dracula and The Revenge of Frankenstein.

He found support in Anderson's long-serving collaborator Desmond Saunders, who directed the first episode and stayed on as production manager for the rest of the series.

Noting Joe 90s subscription to \"wider themes in Cold War culture\", Cull likens the BIG RAT's capabilities to brainwashing but concludes that fundamentally it is \"benign\" technology. The stronger violence introduced in Captain Scarlet is sometimes evident in Joe 90: in \"Hi-Jacked\", Joe kills an enemy with a grenade, while in \"Project 90\", Mac narrowly avoids having his head pulverised by a drill.
