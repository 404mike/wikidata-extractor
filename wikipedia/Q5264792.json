He was sound editor for Floods of Fear (1959).While working on puppet series for Anderson, the A.P. Films team received constant requests to make the puppets more real. Once, Saunders chose all of the male puppets and put little penises on them. When the girls came in during the morning, there was, as Saunders describes, \"the most terrible uproar\". In response, he said: \"Well, you know, you gotta bring them to life somehow, haven't you?\".He died on 21 April 2018 at the age of 91.", "link_mentions": {}}}
