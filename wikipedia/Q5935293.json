He installed a steam engine designed by a member of his staff, James Sadler, in 1798 which, as well as working the chain pumps, drove woodworking machinery and a pump to take water from a well round the dockyard for fire-fighting purposes. This well was some  away and the pumps operated by a horizontal reciprocating wooden spear housed in a tunnel running from the engine house to the top of the well. The Sadler engine was a house-built table engine installed in a single-storey engine house with integral boiler; it replaced one of the horse-drives to the chain pumps. This engine was replaced in 1807 in the same house by another, more powerful, table engine made by Fenton, Murray and Wood of Leeds and, in turn, in 1830 by a Maudslay beam engine."]}, {"page": "Table engine", "response": ["This pattern of engine was first introduced by James Sadler at the Portsmouth Dockyard in 1798 and was house-built in that its framing was formed by the engine house, as had been common practice for beam engines."]}, {"page": "Timeline of aviation \u2013 18th century", "response": ["**October 4, Englishman James Sadler makes the first hot air balloon flight in England, from Oxford to Woodeaton."]}, {"page": "Christ Church Meadow, Oxford", "response": ["James Sadler made the first ascent in a balloon by an Englishman from the Meadow on 4 October 1784.

His plan was that the engine should be used not only to drain the reservoir (by night) but also to drive a sawmill and woodworking machinery (during the day); he also envisaged linking it to a freshwater well, to enable water to be pumped through a network of pipes to various parts of the dockyard. A table engine, designed by Bentham's staff chemist James Sadler, was installed in 1799; it represented the first use of steam power in a Royal Naval Yard. By 1800 a second steam engine (a Boulton & Watt beam engine) was being installed alongside the first. Meanwhile, Bentham designed and built a series of subterranean vaulted chambers over the reservoir, upon which he erected a pair of parallel three-storey workshops to contain reciprocating and circular saws, planning machines and morticing machines, built to his own designs, to be driven by the two engines (which were accommodated together with their boilers in the south workshop). Tanks installed on the upper floor provided a head of water for Bentham's aforementioned dockyard-wide pipe network, providing both salt water for firefighting and fresh water for various uses (including, for the first time, provision of drinking water to ships on the wharves) sourced from a newly sunk 274\u00a0ft well."]}, {"page": "Moulsey Hurst", "response": ["* May 1785 \u2013 James Sadler made a hot air balloon ascent near here, accompanied by a member of parliament, about a year after the success of the Montgolfier Brothers balloon"]}, {"page": "James Sadler", "response": ["James Sadler may refer to:", "* James Sadler (balloonist) (1753\u20131828), first English balloonist", "* James Sadler (cricketer) (1830\u20131865), English cricketer", "* James Sadler and Sons Ltd, English pottery manufacturer"]}, {"page": "Woodeaton", "response": ["James Sadler, the first English balloonist, landed near the village after his first ascent from Christ Church Meadow in Oxford on 4 October 1784.
