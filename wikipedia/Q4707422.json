Swan's problems then took a supernatural bent as the young couple became convinced that their Plymouth home was haunted \u2013 the family moved 260 miles back to the more friendly surroundings of Stoke. He got off on the wrong foot with the Argyle fans after the local media pointed out that his goal saving tackle at Vale Park on 19 February 1994 had cost Plymouth promotion (Vale had finished three points ahead of Plymouth, who lost out to Burnley in the playoffs); Shilton also did little to help Swan's cause by appointing him as captain at the expense of fan's favourite Steve Castle. His new teammates also resented the record-signing Northerner for intruding on their clique. Rudge offered Shilton \u00a3150,000 to bring Swan back to Vale Park, but was refused; the local press asked Swan \"If you're so desperate to leave, why did you come to Plymouth in the first place?\"; his answer of \"For the money\" only served to further incense supporters. Meanwhile, he had off-the-field scuffles with teammates Alan Nicholls and Kevin Nugent. Despite this, Swan's form on the pitch did improve towards the end of the season. Shilton was replaced by Steve McCall, who was in turn replaced by caretaker-manager Russell Osman, though neither men were able to steer the club away from relegation at the end of 1994\u201395 \u2013 to Swan's delight."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Football League", "response": ["Two Division Three clubs were hit by major tragedy in the 1995-96 season.

In his 46 Third Division appearances, he kept 29 clean sheets and conceded only 20 goals, both new Football League records for a 46-match season.  At the end of the season, he was elected by his fellow professionals into the PFA Team of the Year for the Third Division.  No other player played in every league game; Bailey came closest, playing 45 times, followed by Harris with 44.  Three players played in only one match during the season: Steve Brown, Alan Nicholls and Kevin Bremner.  Brown, who had only joined the club in March 1995 but did not figure in Pulis' plans once he took over as manager, left the club early in October to join Lincoln City.  Nicholls joined the club on a one-month contract to serve as cover for Stannard and played once in the League Trophy.  His one-month contract was not extended and he joined non-League club Stalybridge Celtic but was killed in a motorcycle accident on 25 November.  Bremner, the coach of the club's youth team, played as a substitute in a League Trophy match; it was his only appearance for Gillingham.  Fortune-West was the team's top goalscorer; he scored 12 goals in Third Division matches, 2 in the FA Cup and 1 in the League Cup for a total of 15 goals.  Bailey was the only other player to reach double figures, scoring 10 goals.  Chairman Scally registered himself as a player towards the end of the season in the hope that, if the club had already secured promotion, he would be able to play in the final game and thereby win a bet with friends, but Pulis refused to select him."]}]}}
