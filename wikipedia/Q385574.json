He won 20 caps for Wales, and was part of the 1910 touring British Isles team to South Africa.\nWebb was a strong forward player who was part of three Triple Crown Wales teams, and won 19 consecutive caps, all while playing for a 'second class' team, normally unpopular with selectors. On 22 December 1908, Webb while captain of Abertillery, lead his team against the first touring Australian team. The resulting 3-3 draw is one of the greatest days in the club's history.Webb is remembered as a powerful scrummager, strong at line-outs and mauls. He was a modest, proud and defiantly loyal man.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Webb", "response": ["*Jim Webb (born 1946), American author, also politician (see below)", "*Jim Webb (audio engineer), American film audio engineer", "*Jim Webb (poet), American poet, playwright, and essayist", "*Jim Webb (Family Affairs), a fictional character in UK soap opera Family Affairs", "*Jim Webb (born 1946), former Senator from Virginia, former U.S. Secretary of the Navy, and 2016 Presidential candidate", "*Jim Webb (Canadian politician), founding member of the New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party", "*Jim Webb (judo) (James R.
