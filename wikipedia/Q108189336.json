In 1801, she travelled with her sister, Elizabeth Gwillim, and her sister's husband, Sir Henry Gwillim, to Madras, India (now Chennai). She resided in Madras until 1808, and during this time she produced a series of watercolours of local landscapes as well as a series of watercolours of Indian fish. Her letters are noteworthy for the insight they offer about life in early nineteenth-century Madras.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elizabeth Gwillim (bird artist)", "response": ["Elizabeth was born in the valley of Wye, Hereford, daughter of Esther and Thomas Symonds. She had three sisters: Ann (called Nancy), Mary Symonds (called Polly), and Hester (called Hetty), as well as a younger brother, Thomas, who died in infancy. Her father Thomas Symonds was a stonemason and was sworn a Freeman of the City of Hereford on December 10, 1753. He was also a draughtsman, architect, and monumental mason whose work in Hereford and Somerset was very well-regarded. In 1775 he was acting as clerk of works for Richard Payne Knight at Downton Castle. He was appointed surveyor of the Hereford Cathedral in 1777; following the collapse of the tower (a disaster which he had warned of) in 1786 he retired. Upon his death in March of 1791, his wife Esther continued his business until 1803. Esther Symonds died in 1806.", "Elizabeth Gwillim, her husband, her unmarried sister Mary Symonds, Sir Henry\u2019s assistant Richard Clarke, another clerk, and two Indian servants embarked at Plymouth on the Hindostan in late February 1801, arriving in Madras (now called Chennai) almost five months later, on July 27. Their life there is thoroughly detailed in letters, now held in the British Library,Lady Elizabeth Gwillim Papers: 1801-1809, MSS Eur C240, India Office Records, British Library, London, England from the sisters to their mother, sister Hester, and friends back in England. The letters cover a wide variety of topics such as the climate, the landscape, the food, local social and religious customs, and much more. Scholars from many fields have read the Gwillim-Symonds letters for information on diverse subjects, such as their visits to women in the zenanas and the role of devadasi women in society. Most famously, however, Gwillim detailed the natural world around her in her letters and in the many bird paintings she created in her seven years in Madras.", "We know of Gwillim\u2019s own artistic process from the letters, primarily this description from Mary: \u201cPoor Betsy is never out of trouble for if you gets [sic] dead subjects to draw from they become offensive before she can finish the work to her mind, & when the birds are brought in alive they stare, or kick, or peck, or do some vile trick or other that frightens her out of her wits, sometimes she thinks the birds look sick, that is whenever they stand quiet & then in a great fit of tenderness she lets them fly before they are finished, least thier [sic] sufferings should be revenged upon her or their ghosts should come flying round her & flapping thier [sic] great wings, scare her to death. These are serious troubles I assure you. But we do all we can to remedy such evils & have now got a venerable looking old Moor man who catches a bird at a time he holds them in proper attitudes or feeds these miserable captives in a proper manner, for her poor concience [sic] sake.\u201dMary Symonds to Hester James, Madras, February 7th, 1803, British Library, India Office Records, Mss.Eur.C.240/2, ff. 107r-110v.", "Mary further details that in addition to the live birds which cause trouble as subjects, there are also dried skins of birds all around their house. Mary notes in a different letter that \u201cher present employments keep her quite happy I almost wish you could see her in her glory;  that is, with about twenty black men round her, a table full of books, the floor strewed with baskets of seeded branches of trees, and she herself standing in the midst with her cap snatched [?] to one side and talking away till she is quite fatigued.\u201dFrom Mary Symonds to her mother Esther Symonds, [October] 1803. British Library, India Office Records, Mss.Eur.C.240/2, ff. 160r-162v.", "Elizabeth Gwillim has seen renewed scholarly attention in recent years, thanks in part to the Gwillim Project. This international project is a partnership between McGill University Library\u2019s Rare Books and Collections department (the Gwillim Collection is part of the Blacker Wood collection), the South Asia Collection in Norwich, UK (which holds the Madras Album, primarily attributed to Mary Symonds), the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, and the DakshinaChitra Museum in Chennai, with the collaboration of a network of scholars in Canada, the US, the UK, and India. The Gwillim project is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada."]}, {"page": "Henry Gwillim", "response": ["Gwillim was the eldest son of John Gwillim of Hereford in a family with Welsh origins. He studied law and was called to the Middle Temple on 9 February 1787. Gwillim was knighted in 1801 and, that year, moved to India along with his wife Elizabeth and her sister Mary Symonds. His wife and her sister recorded life in Madras in their letters home, and Elizabeth produced highly accomplished paintings of the birds of the region. Gwillim was sworn in at Madras on 4 September 1801 along with Sir Benjamin Sullivan as a Puisne Justice and was considered an upright magistrate but was embroiled in a controversy when he, being in charge due to the absence of the chief justice Sir Thomas Andrew Strange, made allegations against the conduct and character of Lord William Bentinck. This was related to the Vellore mutiny and the appointment of Captain James Grant, his body guard, as head of the police. Gwillim saw the new police force as an instrument of oppression and abused. Gwillim suggested that Bentinck could not have the blood of Cavendishes who had fought for liberty and suggested that he was a spurious offspring of the family. The advocate-general, who disliked Gwillim, sent a formal complaint to the Court of Directors of the East India Company, leading to an order for his recall being issued on 12 November 1807. Gwillim acknowledged receipt of the order on 29 June 1808 and set sail in October. An enquiry was set up and a letter was issued on 11 April 1810 which confirmed his removal from the Supreme Court with a reduction in his pension."]}]}}
