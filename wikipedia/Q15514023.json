His father, Richard Gurwood, was born in Langton, Yorkshire and hIs mother, Marisco Jay, came from Essex.  The couple had a son, Richard Jay, in 1782 but did not marry until October 1787.  Richard Gurwood died in October 1791.  He had almost certainly been a London merchant, his will describes him as 'Esquire of Hoddesdon', and he left a substantial estate to his wife and two sons.Marisco Jay married Henry Okey in May 1796 and the family seem then to have lived in Hackney.  The Okeys had two children:  Charles born in May 1797; and Marisco born in June 1798.  John became extremely fond of his stepfather and of Charles and Marisco.", "link_mentions": {}}}
