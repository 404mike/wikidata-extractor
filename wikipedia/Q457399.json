This is explained by the fact that many Aromanians, who, as mentioned, belonged to the Greek Orthodox Millet, adopted the Greek language under the influence of the Greek schools and churches, the only ones entitled by the Ottomans to function and to by maintained by the Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople. Thus, in Ottoman eyes, they were practically equated with Greeks. For instance, the future Patriarch Athenagoras, born in Ottoman Epirus, was considered a Greek by descent. But some Vlachs wanted to preserve their language, customs and culture, and as might be expected there was a strong reaction against this policy of Hellenization. Sir Charles Eliot clearly states his work \"Turkey in Europe\" that \"...The Bulgarians, Serbs and Vlachs have millets of their own and do not cooperate in the Hellenic cause\" and that \"we hear of Vlach bands who are said to contend (fight against) Greeks in the region of Karaferia (Veria)\"\".Sir Charles Eliot: \u201cTurkey in Europe\u201d, London 1908, re-printed: Frank Cass & Co. Ltd - London 1965, pp.370-379; There was also pressure on Aromanians to become linguistically assimilated, which can be traced back to the 18th century, when assimilation efforts were encouraged by the Greek missionary Cosmas of Aetolia (1714\u20131779) who taught that Aromanians should speak Greek because as he said \"it's the language of our Church\" and established over 100 Greek schools in northern and western Greece. The offensive of the clergy against the use of Aromanian was by no means limited to religious issues but was a tool devised in order to convince the non-Greek speakers to abandon what they regarded as a \"worthless\" idiom and adopt the superior Greek speech: \"There we are Metsovian brothers, together with those who are fooling themselves with this sordid and vile Aromanian language... forgive me for calling it a language\", \"repulsive speech with a disgusting diction\".Neofytos Doukas, \"Logos peri katastaseos skholeion\"Thede Kahl, Ethnizit\u00e4t und r\u00e4umliche Verteilung der Aromunen in S\u00fcdeuropa.

The Vlachs, recognized as a separate nation by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, were for the first time incorporated in Greece only in 1881, when Thessaly and a part of Epirus were offered to Greece by the Great Powers.
