New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of rave culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ Pete Tong amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the Essential Mix where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance and urban music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as Judge Jules, Danny Rampling,  Trevor Nelson, and the Dreem Teem all moving from London's Kiss 100 to the station."]}, {"page": "Lisa Lopes", "response": ["In 2000, Lopes became a featured rapper on several singles, including Spice Girl Melanie C's \"Never Be the Same Again\", which topped the charts in 35 countries, including the United Kingdom.
