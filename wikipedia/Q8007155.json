Once Oswell arrived in Africa his health quickly recovered and over the next 8 years, except for a short period in England and India, he spent his time exploring and hunting. No source describes the total amount of game Oswell shot, but he shot large numbers of elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, hippopotamus, giraffe and quagga. Every animal Oswell shot, except 3 elephant, were subsequently completely eaten by his camp followers or local tribesmen, he once fed 600 highly emaciated men, women and children of the Bakaa tribe for 7 weeks and sent them home with an abundant supply of meat. According to Sir Samuel Baker, Oswell \"was a first-rate horseman, and all of his shooting was from the saddle, or by dismounting for a shot after he had run his game to bay.\"  Always shooting game from the closest possible range, Oswell had horses he was riding killed by buffalo and white rhinoceros, and on one occasion a lioness landed on his horse's rump. Oswell did almost all of his hunting with a double-barrelled 10 bore muzzle loader made by Purdey which weighed , fired 5 to 6 drams (8.9 to 10.6 g) of fine powder and was specially built to fire solid balls."]}, {"page": "Oswell", "response": ["*William Cotton Oswell (1818\u20131893), English explorer"]}]}}
