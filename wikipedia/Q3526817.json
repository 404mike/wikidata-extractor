He played Minor Counties cricket for Norfolk, a coaching engagement with the Earl of Wilton at Houghton Hall gaining him a residential qualification. At the age of 25, he returned to Sussex to play for the county of his birth, initially enjoying mixed success. At first he played as a batsman who bowled a bit, his bowling developed in 1903 to the point where he was picked for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to Australia under Plum Warner. He played in two Tests, helping Tip Foster add 115 for the ninth wicket in his first match at Sydney.\nMost of Relf's 13-match Test career, though, was played on two tours to South Africa in 1905\u201306 and 1913\u201314, and he played only once against Australia in England, taking five wickets for 85 in a total of 350 at Lord's in 1909, but then being dropped to accommodate Sydney Barnes for the remainder of the series. In the first Test at Johannesburg in 1905\u201306, he bowled the ball, allegedly down the leg-side, that enabled South Africa to record the first-ever victory over England. Warner, again his captain, was reported to have sighed: \"Oh, Albert. How could you?\"\nIn county cricket, Relf was prolific, achieving the \"double\" of 1000 runs and 100 wickets eight times, with a best in 1913 of 1846 runs and 141 wickets. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1914, where it was said of his batting style: \"No one seeing him for the first time would suppose him capable of getting his hundreds in high-class company,\" Wisden said. \"He has a way of letting the ball hit the bat that is certainly not impressive to the eye. Still, the fact remains, that season after season he makes as many runs as men who look twice as good as he is.\"He coached in Auckland from 1907\u201308 to 1909\u201310. Writing in the 1940s, Dan Reese said, \"He was the best cricket coach we have had in New Zealand, being most thorough in his methods and making his young players work at the game.\" Relf also played eight first-class matches for Auckland, scoring 633 runs at 52.75 and taking 53 wickets at 11.79. Auckland were unbeaten in the Plunket Shield during Relf's tenure.Relf played on after the First World War, scoring 153 against Leicestershire at Horsham in his final season, 1921.  He was awarded a benefit game (v Leicestershire) in 1921. The funds raised included the generous donation of 100 guineas by his former captain, KL Ranjitsinhji. By this time, Relf's appearances were limited as he had succeeded his father as cricket coach at Wellington College, and he played later for Berkshire in the Minor Counties.\nRelf shot himself at Wellington, apparently depressed by the illness of his wife. He left the considerable estate for the time of \u00a320,880.His two younger brothers, Robert and Ernest, also played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1913 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Major Booth, George Gunn, Bill Hitch, Albert Relf, Lionel Tennyson "]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Albert Relf"]}, {"page": "Burwash", "response": ["Cricketer Albert Relf (1874\u20131937) was born here, The Who frontman Roger Daltrey maintains a Holmshurst Manor country estate and Lakedown fishery near Burwash Common, Robert Smith, singer and founding member of rock band The Cure is a resident."]}, {"page": "Wilfred Rhodes", "response": ["Rhodes again failed to complete the double in 1913, scoring 1,963 runs (average 32.71) and taking 86 wickets (average 21.88). In the 1913\u201314 English winter, Rhodes went to South Africa with the MCC under the captaincy of  Douglas. A strong England side won the five-match series 4\u20130 against weak opposition. Rhodes scored 731 runs in first-class matches, averaging 34.80, and took 31 wickets at 21.35, which led Wisden to comment on his value as an all-rounder. In the second Test Rhodes took one wicket, his 100th in Test matches, and completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests; the first England player to do so, he was only the third player to reach the double after Australians George Giffen and Monty Noble. In the same match, Rhodes made his second and final Test century, scoring 152 and adding 141 for the first wicket with Albert Relf. He batted for more than five hours, and Wisden said that he \"was too cautious to please the crowd, but his steadiness was invaluable to his side.\" His batting was overshadowed, as Sydney Barnes took 17 wickets in the match. Rhodes resumed his opening partnership with Hobbs in the third Test, sharing a stand of 100, followed by opening partnerships of 92 and 133 in the fourth Test, the only drawn match of the series. In this match Rhodes took three wickets for 33 in the first South African innings. In all Tests on the tour Rhodes scored 289 runs at an average of 41.28 and took six wickets (average 32.50)."]}, {"page": "Sussex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Albert Relf", "|Albert Relf|| 1,594"]}, {"page": "Clem Hill", "response": ["For the first time under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team travelled to Australia for the 1903\u201304 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two. Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276\u00a0runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings. In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a \"very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [crowd] demonstration\". Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground. The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting \"Crock!, Crock!, Crock!\" Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground. Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper.
