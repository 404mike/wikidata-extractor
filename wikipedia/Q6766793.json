At Oxford, he was awarded the Gladstone Memorial Prize. After university he worked for a time for Shirley Williams, then President of the SDP. Later he worked for BBC Television.\nHis first book was Vera Brittain: A Life, co-written with Paul Berry and published in 1995. This biography of the writer and peace campaigner Vera Brittain was shortlisted for the two major non-fiction prizes of its day, the Whitbread Prize and the NCR Book Award as well as the Fawcett Prize.  Bostridge's next Brittain project was a collaboration with Alan Bishop.  Their edition of her letters was published in 1998 as Letters from a Lost Generation, and Bostridge adapted the letters for a BBC Radio Four series starring Amanda Root as Brittain and Rupert Graves as Roland Leighton, who was killed in the First World War.\nBostridge's Lives For Sale, an anthology of biographers' tales, was published in 2004.  In 2008 he published Florence Nightingale: The Woman and Her Legend, the first major biography of Florence Nightingale in over half a century, which was awarded the 2009 Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography and named as a Wall Street Journal Best Book of 2008 and an Atlantic Magazine top book of the year.\nIn 2008, Bostridge also published Because You Died, a selection of Vera Brittain's First World War poetry and prose, to mark the ninetieth anniversary of the Armistice. In May 2009 Screen Daily reported that he was working closely with BBC Films on a screen adaptation of Brittain's Testament of Youth. In December 2014 Bostridge's study Vera Brittain and the First World War, containing new research about Testament of Youth's evolution, and an account of the dramatisations of the book culminating in the new film version starring Alicia Vikander as Vera Brittain and Kit Harington as Roland Leighton, was published by Bloomsbury.\nIn January 2014, Penguin UK published Bostridge's The Fateful Year, a portrait of England in 1914: \"a year that started in peace and ended in war\". The book was shortlisted for the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History in 2015.\nIn June 2016 Bostridge was one of a group of biographers, historians, and other academics who signed a letter to The Times protesting at the erection of a statue to Mary Seacole at St Thomas' Hospital in London. In interviews Bostridge explained that he was not opposed to a statue to Seacole but to the siting of it at the hospital where Florence Nightingale founded her nurse training school in 1860, influencing the development of nursing throughout the world. Bostridge argues that Seacole was not a \"pioneer nurse\" as some of the statue campaigners maintain. He also points to the way in which Nightingale's enormous contributions to public health are now commonly and mistakenly attributed to Seacole by a wide range of British institutions that, he says, should \"frankly know better\".\nIn an article published in the Times Literary Supplement in January 2020, Bostridge revealed that he has recently donated his diary to the Bodleian Library in Oxford.He is a brother of Ian Bostridge. They are the great-grandsons of the Millwall goalkeeper, John \"Tiny\" Joyce.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Streatham", "response": ["*Mark Bostridge, Writer"]}, {"page": "Florence Nightingale", "response": ["As Mark Bostridge has demonstrated, one of Nightingale's signal achievements was the introduction of trained nurses into the workhouse system in Britain from the 1860s onwards. This meant that sick paupers were no longer being cared for by other, able-bodied paupers, but by properly trained nursing staff. In the first half of the 19th century, nurses were usually former servants or widows who found no other job and therefore were forced to earn their living by this work. Charles Dickens caricatured the standard of care in his 1842\u20131843 published novel Martin Chuzzlewit in the figure of Sarah Gamp as being incompetent, negligent, alcoholic and corrupt. According to Caroline Worthington, director of the Florence Nightingale Museum, \"When she [Nightingale] started out there was no such thing as nursing. The Dickens character Sarah Gamp, who was more interested in drinking gin than looking after her patients, was only a mild exaggeration. Hospitals were places of last resort where the floors were laid with straw to soak up the blood. Florence transformed nursing when she got back [from Crimea]. She had access to people in high places and she used it to get things done. Florence was stubborn, opinionated, and forthright but she had to be those things in order to achieve all that she did.\"", "Though Nightingale is sometimes said to have denied the theory of infection for her entire life, a 2008 biography disagrees,Florence Nightingale, the Woman and her Legend, by Mark Bostridge (Viking, 2008) saying that she was simply opposed to a precursor of germ theory known as contagionism. This theory held that diseases could only be transmitted by touch. Before the experiments of the mid-1860s by Pasteur and Lister, hardly anyone took germ theory seriously; even afterwards, many medical practitioners were unconvinced. Bostridge points out that in the early 1880s Nightingale wrote an article for a textbook in which she advocated strict precautions designed, she said, to kill germs. Nightingale's work served as an inspiration for nurses in the American Civil War. The Union government approached her for advice in organising field medicine. Her ideas inspired the volunteer body of the United States Sanitary Commission.", "The first theatrical representation of Nightingale was Reginald Berkeley's The Lady with the Lamp, premiering in London in 1929 with Edith Evans in the title role. It did not portray her as an entirely sympathetic character and draws much characterisation from Lytton Strachey's biography of her in Eminent Victorians.Mark Bostridge, Florence Nightingale \u2013 The Woman and Her Legend It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1951. In 2009, a stage musical play representation of Nightingale entitled The Voyage of the Lass was produced by the Association of Nursing Service Administrators of the Philippines.", "Cecil Woodham-Smith, like Strachey, relied heavily on Cook's Life in her 1950 biography, though she did have access to new family material preserved at Claydon. In 2008, Mark Bostridge published a major new life of Nightingale, almost exclusively based on unpublished material from the Verney Collections at Claydon and from archival documents from about 200 archives around the world, some of which had been published by Lynn McDonald in her projected sixteen-volume edition of the Collected Works of Florence Nightingale (2001 to date)."]}, {"page": "Shirley Williams", "response": ["* Vera Brittain: A Life by Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge (1995)."]}, {"page": "Vera Brittain", "response": ["In 1998, Brittain's First World War letters were edited by Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge and published under the title Letters from a Lost Generation.
