His unique bowling action begins with a short run-up, and culminates with an open-chested extremely wristy release from a partly supinated forearm which had him mistaken for a leg-spinner early in his career by Allan Border. Aside from his stock delivery, the off-break, of which he claimed to have two variations (during a recorded television 'doosra' show off with Mark Nicholas from Channel 4 in 2004), his main deliveries are a fast topspinner which lands on the seam and usually goes straight on, and the doosra, a surprise delivery which turns from leg to off (the opposite direction of his stock delivery) with no easily discernible change of action. Additionally, he would occasionally use one of his several unnamed novelties. His super-flexible wrist makes him especially potent and guarantees him turn on any surface.", "TV presenter Mark Nicholas who tried the brace himself, confirmed that \"There is no way an arm can be bent, or flexed, when it is in this brace.\" All three balls reacted in the same way as when bowled without the brace. They were not bowled quite so fast because the weight of the brace restricts the speed of Muralitharan's shoulder rotation, but the spin was still there."]}, {"page": "September 29", "response": ["*  1957   \u2013 Mark Nicholas, English cricketer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Survivor (franchise)", "response": ["Mark Nicholas (2)"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Mark Nicholas \u2013 Sky Sports 1995\u20131999, Channel 4 1999\u20132005, talksport 2002\u20132003, Nine Network 2003\u20132018, Channel 5 2006\u20132019, ITV Sport 2010\u20132011"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["Boycott worked on Cricket on Five with Mark Nicholas and Simon Hughes as co-commentators, and was a member of the BBC Cricket Team for commentary on the 2006/7 Ashes series.
