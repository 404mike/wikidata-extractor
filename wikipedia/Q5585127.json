Headington also wrote several pieces of chamber music: his Third String Quartet, composed to mark Haydn's 250th anniversary, reworks material from Haydn's Quartet op. 77 no. 2.  Headington's solo piano pieces were strongly influenced by Debussy, Ravel and Chopin. His song-cycle, The Healing Fountain, was written in tribute to Benjamin Britten, and Headington ranked it as his finest achievement. His Piano Concerto of 1991 was also recorded by ASV (with Gordon Fergus-Thompson as soloist) as part of a posthumous collection released in 1997."]}, {"page": "Ferruccio Busoni discography", "response": ["Chaconne: Bach Transcribed by Busoni, Liszt, Rachmaninov and Others.
