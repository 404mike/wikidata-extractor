The band took their name from an episode of radio comedy programme The Goon Show. The band are unusual for using two bass-players in their line-up: Alex Griffin plays melody lines high up on one bass, and Matt Cheslin plays the regular bass lines on the other. This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums.The band was formed at sixth-form college and they recorded their first album while some members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd-surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990). In 2009, Jonn Penney stated, \"We're still adding designs - old habits die hard\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 29", "response": ["*  1971   \u2013 Alex Griffin, English bass player "]}, {"page": "Ned's Atomic Dustbin", "response": ["Ned's Atomic Dustbin are an English rock band formed in Stourbridge, West Midlands, in November 1987.

After creating their own imprint following the success of several prior independent singles, the band recorded the album from December 1990 to January 1991 in London. Musically, God Fodder takes large influence from grebo, shoegaze, noise pop, and dance music, characterized by noisy guitars, complex drum beats, and its usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing regular bass lines and Alex Griffin playing harmonic bass lines. Lyrically, the album features communal efforts written by all the band.", "God Fodder combines grebo music, a \"punk-influenced, electronica-informed, hyper, light-hearted rock\" genre with which the band were associated, with shoegaze music, a genre which forms the album's \"prevailing beat\". The album was described as a \"blend of frenzied, melodic rock, with the occasional touch of quirkiness\", such as the band's usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing \"normal basslines\" whilst Alex Griffin \"scratching out harmonic riffs.\" Besides the twin bass work, the album also features complicated drum beats and distorted guitars throughout. Trouser Press said the album combines catchy melodies, \"pulsing adrenaline beats\" and \"a wool-covered wall of fuzzy pop noise on which able singer Jonn Penney pastes challenging personal lyrics.\"", "Like several bands of the era, the band's bassist Alex Griffin explained that the songs on God Fodder were \"communal efforts\", saying \"It's a lot more gratifying than working with just a single songwriter. One person brings in a 10-second idea and we build on that. It's definitely a group thing,\" adding that \"When people tell me what one of our songs means, I say, 'Yep, you're right.' I'm not gonna dash their dreams.\" \"Selfish\" is a critique on \"trendies, the apathetic and mean-spirited,\" and opens with a sample of the Die Hard dialogue \"why don't you wake up and smell what you're shovelling?,\" which the band included after watching the film and decided it \"fitted in really well.\"  \"Happy\" was written by lead singer Jonn Penney, who, as Griffin explained, \"writes really vague and about personal situations not necessarily his own. He doesn't like to explain.\" Penney's lyrics on God Fodder have been described as personal and challenging."]}, {"page": "Are You Normal?", "response": ["* Alex Griffin -  Bass, Vocals"]}, {"page": "Griffin (surname)", "response": ["* Alex Griffin (born 1971), English guitarist"]}, {"page": "Brainbloodvolume", "response": ["Palmer's \"especially careful\" production \"gets [the material] all down in a clear mix of bristling, textured power and slick commercial\" whilst ably following \"the group's minor stylistic perambulations while juggling modern dance beats, driving rock, pinging atmospherics, found-sound silliness and glossy mid-tempo pop.\" Guitarist Rat and sometimes bassist Alex Griffin indulge \"in crispier sometimes-abstract performances that suggest early-'80s post-punk \u00e0 la New Order and the Cure.\""]}]}}
