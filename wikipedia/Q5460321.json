The War Office refused permission for Eric Gill and Jacob Epstein to be released, and by the time the Army had processed the requests for Stanley Spencer and Darsie Japp the war was almost over. Although Muirhead Bone suggested nineteen well-known, modern women artists, including Dora Carrington and Orovida Pissarro for commissions, the BWMC ignored his advice and only recruited three women artists, Anna Airy, Dorothy Coke and Flora Lion but did not acquire any paintings from them. A number of pacifists and conscientious objectors were approached. Both Duncan Grant and Mark Gertler agreed to work for the Committee but the latter was refused permission by the body supervising conscientious objectors. Harold Knight refused to do any work that could be used as propaganda."]}, {"page": "Lily Delissa Joseph", "response": ["Joseph was born in Bermondsey in London into a wealthy, cultured Jewish family. Her elder brother was the artist Solomon Joseph Solomon, and Flora Lion would be a cousin. Joseph attended the Ridley School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London. She painted portraits, interiors and urban landscapes in a style clearly influenced by Impressionism but often with a limited palette."]}]}}
