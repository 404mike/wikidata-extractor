He sang ballads and popular songs of the Edwardian era, the First World War and the inter-War period. He sang mostly in music halls and variety theatres and was a popular recording artist.\nBorn and brought up in Manchester, Kirkby worked in a warehouse from the age of 12; he went on to win first prize in a baritone singing competition at the age of 22. His career moved to London where he formed a number of collaborations on stage with other variety artists; these became well known for their smartly-dressed and musically-excellent performances. In 1915 he teamed up with Harry Hudson to form the popular duo \"Kirkby and Hudson\". They entertained audiences with their eclectic mix of songs and humour well into the 1920s. Kirkby became especially well known for his concert party performances at The Oval, Margate in Kent.\nKirkby was a prolific recording artist and has been credited with making the largest number of records in Britain from the 1900s to the 1930s. Although he was among the first to record roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas, much of his recorded output was popular songs, the subject matter of which ranged from the topical to the comic. He was one of the highest paid recording artists of his time.\nIn the mid-1920s he was a joint theatrical producer of a burlesque revue. In the 1930s he broadcast on BBC radio variety shows. He was a founder member of an early British record company which produced Clarion cylinders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jingoism", "response": ["*The song, We Didn't Want To Fight - Sung by Stanley Kirkby"]}, {"page": "Galloping Major", "response": ["* \"The Galloping Major\" (song), a popular song originally performed in 1906 by George Henry Bastow and covered by Stanley Kirkby in 1910"]}, {"page": "Peelennium", "response": ["| Stanley Kirkby and Orchestra"]}, {"page": "Ernest Pike", "response": ["Pike used many different pseudonyms the greatest number being for his Zonophone recordings.

To retain the authenticity of the stage performances, these recordings were to be directly overseen by Rupert D'Oyly Carte.Shepherd, Marc. \"The First D'Oyly Carte Recordings\", Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 November 2001, accessed 18 October 2012 Pike was one of the chosen singers along with Peter Dawson, Derek Oldham, George Baker, Stanley Kirkby, Robert Radford, Edna Thornton, Violet Essex, Sarah Jones and Bessie Jones. Pike shared the singing of both Nanki-Poo and Pish Tush in The Mikado (1917); sang Luiz, Francesco and parts of Marco in The Gondoliers (1919), and Leonard Meryll and the First Yeoman in The Yeomen of the Guard (1920). He sang the Duke of Dunstable in Patience (1921). In 1918 he sang Silas Simkins in HMV's complete recording of Merrie England by Edward German.", "Pike is probably best remembered for his prolific output of the popular songs of his day. He became well known for his recordings of First World War songs, for example the American song \"There's a Long Long Trail\" in 1916 and \"Take me Back to Dear Old Blighty\" (as Eric Courtland) in a duet with George Baker (as Walter Jeffries) in 1917; he also made one of the earliest recordings of the famous ballad \"Roses of Picardy\" in 1918 shortly after it had been written. He collaborated with other well-known artists, for example with Peter Dawson in Dawson's recording of \"The Lost Chord\" made in 1907 and with Stanley Kirkby in \"When You Wore a Tulip\" in 1916 (as Cobbett and Walker) and \"She Sells Sea Shells on the Seashore\" in 1908 (as Herbert Payne with Fred Cooper). Occasionally he would form part of a backing group or chorus in the recording studio known as \"The Minster Singers\" along with some or all of the following: Stanley Kirkby, Eleanor Jones-Hudson, Peter Dawson and Thorpe Bates; sometimes there were additional singers in this group.  The Minster Singers also recorded songs in its own right, for example \"In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree\" in 1906."]}, {"page": "Keep the Home Fires Burning (Ivor Novello song)", "response": ["James F.
