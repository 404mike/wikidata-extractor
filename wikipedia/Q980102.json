Lawrence had a hand in the winning goal, as his second-half free kick was headed on by Jermaine Grandison, for James Collins to loop over Norwich goalkeeper Declan Rudd."]}, {"page": "John Ruddy", "response": ["For the 2012\u201313 season Ruddy found himself first choice again ahead of Declan Rudd, Jed Steer and new goalie Mark Bunn. Once again, he saved a penalty during Norwich's first home Premier League fixture of the season during a 1\u20131 draw with Queens Park Rangers, although Bobby Zamora scored the rebound. He kept memorable clean sheets against Arsenal and Manchester United as Norwich won 1\u20130 on both occasions, both occurring during an outstanding run of form that saw him keep four clean sheets and concede just two goals in six matches. Unfortunately this great run of form came to an end during a 1\u20131 draw against his former club Everton when he suffered a thigh injury. He later underwent surgery, ruling him out for three months. However, Ruddy's injury later worsened, with the expectation that he would not be fit again until April. Ruddy returned to action on 7 May 2013 in Norwich's 4\u20130 Premier League win over West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed mathematical safety from relegation. He also played in Norwich's final match of the season on 19 May 2013, a 3\u20132 away win against Manchester City."]}, {"page": "Joleon Lescott", "response": ["Lescott made his debut twelve days later, playing the entirety of a 3\u20132 loss away to Leicester City. On 5 December, he scored his first goal for Villa, finishing Jordan Veretout's corner kick to open a 1\u20131 draw at Southampton. Lescott scored again for The Villans when another of his headers was fumbled by Wayne Hennessey in what proved to be the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over Crystal Palace on 12 January 2016, just the team's second win of the 2015\u201316 season and first of 20 matches, and their first clean sheet since 8 November. On 6 February 2016, Lescott was on the score sheet again in a 2\u20130 victory over Norwich City, his header finding its way past Declan Rudd from Carles Gil's corner."]}, {"page": "List of retired numbers in association football", "response": ["* Reading, Notts County and Bryne reserve the number 13 for their supporters, Panathinaikos reserve this number in honour of Gate 13, the ultras based in the respective gate in home matches.

After some injury setbacks, he scored his first goal of the 2011\u201312 season away to Norwich City, pouncing on a confusion between Richie De Laet and Declan Rudd. Odemwingie's second goal of the season came in the Black Country derby, where West Bromwich Albion defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 2\u20130. Odemwingie scored a spectacular goal against Blackburn Rovers on 17 December, putting West Brom into a late lead after James Morrison had scored a stunning volley earlier in the half.Blackburn Rovers 1\u20132 West Bromwich Albion | Premier League match report | Football | The Observer.

He was voted Preston's Player of the Year for the 2011\u201312 season. During his time at Preston North End he was often used as a backup goalkeeper after the loan signing of Declan Rudd in the 2013\u201314 season and Sam Johnstone in the second half of the 2014\u201315 season. He did however secure a run of games following a spell of poor performances from then number 1 keeper Jamie Jones beginning with a clean sheet away at then league leaders Bristol City. During his final season with Preston he became a regular cup goalkeeper, keeping goal in their Football League Trophy run which took them to the Northern area final as well as keeping goal in their successful FA Cup run which included wins against Shrewsbury Town, Norwich City and Sheffield United, culminating in what would be his final start in a home tie against Premier League Manchester United."]}, {"page": "Chris Maxwell (footballer)", "response": ["Declan Rudd was signed by Preston in June 2017, as competition for the number 1 spot.
