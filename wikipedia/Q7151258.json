The character has cerebral palsy and was introduced to the show as part of the BBC's commitment to diversity on television, with series producer Emma Turner explaining: \"The BBC aims to make Holby City truly representative of its audience and Paul is an essential ingredient of that.\" Henshall, who became the first disabled actor to feature permanently in a TV series, was cast after applying for the BBC's Talent Scheme, which also won him a role in the eighteenth series of sister show Casualty. The role of Dean was created specifically for Henshall, who describes the character as: \"cheeky but kind hearted. He's probably not really as confident as he appears.\" Dean's storylines concentrate on his attempts to progress in his career despite his disability, and his friendship with fellow medical student Matt Parker. After falling out with Matt, Dean leaves to pursue a career opportunity in psychiatry. While Henshall stated: \"I never attempt to play Dean as a 'disabled character'. I just try to make him as real as I can as a person\", upon his departure from the series, he commented: \"I would have liked to see Dean doing more on the show and not always making mistakes and being a scapegoat. I wasn't happy that I'd seen myself described as being 'brought in to honour the BBC's commitment to disabled actors'; if Dean had done more on the show, they would have been able to talk about my storylines.\" With regards to public reception of the character, Henshall stated: \"I get a lot of positive responses about Dean.
