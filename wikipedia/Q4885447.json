Hart (1888after 1947) was an English bridge player and writer. Austrian bridge player and theorist Paul Stern had (being a Jew and also strongly anti-Nazi) sought refuge in London after Nazi Germany occupied Austria in the 1938 Anschluss. According to the Introduction to the book by English bridge writer Guy Ramsay, Stern had known Darvas in the 1930s and in his exile had become friends with Hart. Stern proposed a book by the two of them, combining the Hungarian's fantasy and wit and the Englishman's fancy and humour. Soviet Russia, which had taken control of Hungary after World War II, considered bridge a decadent game. By devious routes Darvas smuggled out his ideas for bridge deals to Stern, who passed them on to Hart, who wrote the narrative. There were still difficulties to overcome; they were solved by English bridge player and writer Ben Cohen, who gave the book its title and even managed to arrange for Darvas to come to England to see it through to publication."]}]}}
