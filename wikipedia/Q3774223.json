Having made his debut for Wales in 1946, he surpassed Keenor's total and amassed 39 caps while a Cardiff player. Wales qualified for its first major international tournament at the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Five Cardiff players were selected in the nation's 23-man squad for the competition: Colin Baker, Ron Hewitt, Ken Jones, Derrick Sullivan and Graham Vearncombe. Sullivan became the first Cardiff player to feature in a World Cup during Wales' opening fixture against Hungary. Baker and Hewitt also played in the competition, while goalkeepers Jones and Vearncombe remained unused reserves. In 2003, Australian defender Tony Vidmar became the first Cardiff player to represent a country from outside the British Isles. The final nation of the British Isles to have a representative from Cardiff was England, when Jay Bothroyd won a single cap in 2010. Icelandic midfielder Aron Gunnarsson overtook Sherwood to become the club's most capped international player in 2016. He went on to win 62 caps before leaving the club in 2019."]}, {"page": "List of Wales national football team World Cup and European Championship squads", "response": ["| 13 || GK || Graham Vearncombe ||  || ||  Cardiff City ||"]}]}}
