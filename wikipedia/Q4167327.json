He was born in Aberdeen in Scotland, but began his professional career with Manchester United, where he spent four years before joining nearby Preston North End in 1961. In six seasons there, he made almost 200 league appearances and scored 114 goals. He then spent a year with fellow Lancashire side Bury, before moving to Brighton & Hove Albion. In 1970, he went on loan to Brentford, but his league career ended the following year. He spent two more seasons playing for Corby Town before retiring in 1973.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Aberdonians", "response": ["*Alex Dawson (born 1940), footballer"]}, {"page": "1958 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|OR ||7 || Alex Dawson"]}, {"page": "1964 FA Cup Final", "response": ["West Ham, captained by Bobby Moore and managed by Ron Greenwood, won the match 3\u20132 to win the FA Cup for the first time.

The loan signing of former Busby Babe Alex Dawson from Brighton & Hove Albion in September 1970 helped improve matters, with the forward scoring 7 goals in 11 appearances and inspiring a five-match winning streak in October and November. Frustratingly, a \u00a37,000 deal to buy him fell through and he left the club after his loan expired. The final match in which Dawson scored was a 2\u20131 victory over Gillingham in the FA Cup first round and while the team would slowly pull themselves away from the relegation zone and finish comfortably in mid-table, the FA Cup gradually became the main focus of the season. Third Division club Walsall were beaten in the second round, but the third round draw failed to produce a money-spininng tie and instead an away trip to fellow Fourth Division club Workington. A John Docherty goal was enough to see off Workington and the fourth round draw produced another away tie, this time to Second Division club Cardiff City. Over 23,000 watched Brentford run out 2\u20130 winners at Ninian Park, courtesy of goals from Jackie Graham and John Docherty. Brentford also faced Second Division opponents in the fifth round \u2013 Hull City and victory would have made Brentford the second Fourth Division club to reach the last-eight of the FA Cup.
