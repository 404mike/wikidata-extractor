The stone was recovered from a 16th-century manor house known as Tocketts Hall, which had been the home of General John Hale: Hale had married into the Chaloner family and the house subsequently came into the ownership of the politician, Robert Chaloner, shortly before it was demolished in the early 19th century. The town hall was initially arcaded with a shambles on the ground floor and an assembly room on the first floor; a second floor was added in 1870. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Westgate; there were three segmental windows on the ground floor, five sash windows on the first floor and five rounded headed windows on the second floor. The central section of three bays was flanked by full-height pilasters supporting a pediment containing a cartouche with the coat of arms of the Chaloner family in the tympanum."]}]}}
