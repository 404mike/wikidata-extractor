His first full season on the European Tour was 2002 and his first European Tour win came at the 2004 Celtic Manor Wales Open. In 2006 he finished second at the prestigious BMW Championship to earn \u20ac472,220, which was his biggest prize cheque up to that time.\nHis best year-end ranking on the European Order of Merit has been 25th in 2006 and 2010. He has featured in the top 100 of the Official World Golf Rankings. After losing his tour card in 2009, Khan was a medalist at the Qualifying School tournament. In 2010 he won the BMW PGA Championship, earning \u20ac750,000 and securing his Tour card for five years in the process.Khan produced another fine run at the BMW PGA Championship in 2013, when he recorded the second runner-up finish of his career, to add to his 2010 victory, at Wentworth. After finishing at 10 under par, Khan entered a three-man playoff alongside Matteo Manassero and Marc Warren. In the playoff, Warren was eliminated at the first extra hole and after matching pars and birdies, Khan was defeated on the fourth extra hole by Manassero. After a good drive, Khan knocked his second shot into the water and could only make a bogey six and Manassero after two fine shots onto the green, two-putted for the victory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sergio Garc\u00eda", "response": ["| Simon Khan"]}, {"page": "David Howell (golfer)", "response": ["| Simon Khan"]}, {"page": "2004 in Wales", "response": ["*4 June \u2013 Simon Khan breaks the course record at the Celtic Manor Wales Open golf tournament."]}, {"page": "BMW PGA Championship", "response": ["| 2013 || Matteo Manassero|| align=\"center\" |278 || align=center|\u221210 || Playoff ||  Simon Khan Marc Warren ||Wentworth Club|| align=\"center\" |791,660", "| 2010 || Simon Khan|| align=\"center\" |278 || align=center|\u22126 || 1 stroke ||  Fredrik Andersson Hed  Luke Donald ||Wentworth Club|| align=\"center\" |750,000", "| 2006 || David Howell|| align=\"center\" |271 || align=center|\u221217 || 5 strokes ||  Simon Khan ||Wentworth Club|| align=\"center\" |708,330"]}, {"page": "Paul Casey", "response": ["| Simon Khan"]}, {"page": "Wales Open", "response": ["There was another playoff in 2004 when Paul Casey and Simon Khan tied on 267, 21-under-par.

Warren had led for most of the final round before consecutive bogeys at the 14th and 15th put him one shot behind. However he picked up a birdie at the 16th, but then proceeded to three-putt both the 17th and 18th to once again fall a shot outside the playoff and into a tie for fourth. A few weeks later at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, Warren lost out in a three-man sudden-death playoff for the title. He birdied the first four holes on the back nine during the final round to go into a one shot lead, but bogeyed 15, then parred his way in to make the playoff with Simon Khan and Matteo Manassero. At the first extra hole, Warren drove his tee shot into the trees on the right at 18 and had to go back to the tee. After hitting his drive down the fairway, he then dumped his fourth shot into the water hazard. He managed to get up and down for a double-bogey, but both Khan and Manassero made birdies to eliminate Warren.", "| Simon Khan,  Matteo Manassero"]}]}}
