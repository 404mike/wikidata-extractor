The match was dominated by Swindon but the first half ended goalless.  In the 53rd minute, Crystal Palace's captain Jeff Hopkins scored an own goal after a dangerous cross from Dave Hockaday.  Swindon manager Lou Macari suggested that his side were favourites going into the second leg but added \"we shan't be defending\".  The return leg took place at Selhurst Park three days later.  The largest crowd of the season meant congestion caused the kick off to be delayed by fifteen minutes.  On eight minutes, Mark Bright scored his 25th goal of the season after Paul Digby had beaten away a shot from David Madden, to put Palace ahead.  Seven minutes before half-time, Ian Wright doubled the lead after scoring from a Bright header.  The match ended 2\u20130 and Crystal Palace qualified for the final with a 2\u20131 aggregate win."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Paul Digby", "| 1 July 2017 || CB ||  || Paul Digby || Ipswich Town || Free || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2017 || CB ||  || Paul Digby ||  Mansfield Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 July 2018 || CB ||  || Paul Digby || Forest Green Rovers || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Forest Green Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 July 2018 || CB ||  || Paul Digby || Mansfield Town || Undisclosed || "]}]}}
