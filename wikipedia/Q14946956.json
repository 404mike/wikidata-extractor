Freya Johnston, writing in the Literary Review, observed of the biography:  \"David Nokes offers no fresh critical interpretations of Johnson; he treats Rasselas, a vigorous, bleak and witty road novel, as a problematic repository of its author's 'obsessions'. Given Johnson's hope that biography might instruct and appeal to everyone, it seems a pity to identify his works as - above all else - symptoms of an odd sensibility: it makes them less invitingly applicable to the rest of us.\"Freya Johnston, Toilet Humors, Samuel Johnson: A Life, The Literary Review, Nov. 2009"]}, {"page": "Nokes, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Nokes"]}]}}
