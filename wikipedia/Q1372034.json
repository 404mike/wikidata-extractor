Artistic activity within Cornwall was initially centred on the art-colony of Newlyn, most active at the turn of the 20th century. This Newlyn School is associated with the names of Stanhope Forbes, Elizabeth Forbes, Norman Garstin and Lamorna Birch. Modernist writers such as D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf lived in Cornwall between the wars, and Ben Nicholson, the painter, having visited in the 1920s came to live in St Ives with his then wife, the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, at the outbreak of the Second World War. They were later joined by the Russian emigrant Naum Gabo, and other artists. These included Peter Lanyon, Terry Frost, Patrick Heron, Bryan Wynter and Roger Hilton. St Ives also houses the Leach Pottery, where Bernard Leach, and his followers championed Japanese inspired studio pottery. Much of this modernist work can be seen in Tate St Ives. The Newlyn Society and Penwith Society of Arts continue to be active, and contemporary visual art is documented in a dedicated online journal."]}, {"page": "Newlyn School", "response": ["*Lamorna Birch"]}, {"page": "1869 in art", "response": ["* June 7 \u2013 Lamorna Birch, born Samuel John Birch, English painter (died 1955)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Cornwall", "response": ["*Lamorna Birch, artist and member of the Newlyn School"]}, {"page": "Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi", "response": ["|Lamorna Birch \u2013 John Duncan Fergusson \u2013 Edward Halliday \u2013 Isobel Heath \u2013 Richard Jack - Mina Loy \u2013 Laura Muntz Lyall \u2013 Ottilie Maclaren Wallace \u2013 Bessie MacNicol - Cedric Morris \u2013 Samuel Peploe \u2013 Elizabeth Polunin \u2013 Dod Procter \u2013 Robert William Service \u2013 Stansmore Dean Stevenson - Edith Grace Wheatley - Sydney Curnow Vosper"]}, {"page": "1955 in art", "response": ["*January 7 \u2013 Lamorna Birch, English painter (b. 1869)"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Lamorna Birch (1869\u20131955) \u2013 English painter"]}, {"page": "Laura Knight", "response": ["In late 1907 the Knights moved to Cornwall, staying first in Newlyn, before moving to the nearby village of Lamorna.
