In 1895 he received a commission in the 3rd Volunteer Battalion of the Manchester Regiment. Broadbent served as part of the detachment the battalion sent to serve with the regular army during the Second Boer War.When the Territorial Force was created in 1908, the 3rd VB of the Manchesters became the 9th Battalion (TF). Broadbent, by this time holding the rank of major, transferred to the new force. He resigned his commission in 1912, but rejoined the battalion in 1914 on the outbreak of the First World War. He went on to be promoted to lieutenant-colonel and command the battalion.After the war he became involved in politics, becoming the president of the Ashton Conservative Association. At the 1929 general election, he was the party's candidate in Ashton-under-Lyne, but lost by a margin of over 3,000 votes to the sitting Labour MP, Albert Bellamy.\nHowever, Bellamy died in March 1931, causing a by-election. Broadbent was again the Conservative candidate, and he campaigned vigorously on the issue of trade tariffs. He hired a shop window in the centre of the town which he filled with a display of imported textiles and goods that he claimed were displacing locally produced goods. In the event, Broadbent was elected with a majority of 1,415, helped by a split in the Labour vote caused by the presence of a candidate for Oswald Mosley's New Party.  He held the seat at the 1931 general election, with an increased majority.  However, at the 1935 general election he was defeated by the Labour Party candidate Fred Simpson by a majority of only 114 votes.\nBroadbent was a large landowner in Derbyshire's Hope Valley, and he died at his residence in the area,  \"Bella Vista\", Castleton in June 1938, aged 65.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Broadbent"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Broadbent"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|John Broadbent"]}, {"page": "1938 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 9 June \u2013 John Broadbent, army officer and politician (born 1872)"]}, {"page": "John Broadbent (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Broadbent (1872\u20131938) was British Army officer and Conservative politician.", "John Broadbent may also refer to:", "*Sir John Broadbent, 2nd Baronet (died 1946), English physician"]}, {"page": "Fred Simpson (politician)", "response": ["He was elected at the 1935 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ashton-under-Lyne, defeating the Conservative MP John Broadbent by a majority of only 114 votes."]}, {"page": "Albert Bellamy", "response": ["Bellamy was re-elected at the 1929 general election.
