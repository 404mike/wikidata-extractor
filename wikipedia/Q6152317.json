This meant that on a weekday, holders would receive no discount if the standard adult full fare was \u00a310.00 or less, and a discount of less than 34% on fares between \u00a310.05 and \u00a315.00.  Longer journeys for children would also become more expensive.  Transport pressure group Transport 2000 and environmental organisation Friends of the Earth condemned the proposals, and Reading East MP Jane Griffiths tabled an Early Day Motion in the British Parliament opposing the changes.  This gained the support of 38 other MPs from all major parties.  Research commissioned by Transport 2000 indicated that 90% of journeys typically made in the railcard area would no longer gain any discount (as a result of the full adult fare being \u00a310.00 or below), a further 3.5% would attract a discount of less than 34%, and only 6.5% would still be subject to the full 34% discount as before.  This reflects the fact that many journeys undertaken in the area are short and \"local\" in nature, and that the area as a whole is fairly small in size (as the map shows, it does not extend a very long way from London in any direction)."]}, {"page": "List of people from Reading, Berkshire", "response": ["* Jane Griffiths (b. 1954; former Member of Parliament for Reading)"]}, {"page": "Blair Babe", "response": ["| 37. || Jane Griffiths || Reading East || 1997 || 2005 || Deselected"]}, {"page": "Bagnall fireless locomotives (preserved)", "response": ["In 2003, Jane Griffiths (who was Member of Parliament for Reading East at the time) discovered the locomotive and mounted a campaign to return it to Reading.
