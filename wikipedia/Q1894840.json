Each had started out as child prodigies.Her sisters, May (1890-1959), Beatrice (1892-1965), and Monica (1897-1983), became, respectively, a violinist, a cellist, and a mezzo-soprano. All four were reportedly also talented pianists. Her eldest sister, May Harrison, became known for her interpretations of the violin works of Bach, Brahms and Delius while her sister, Beatrice, was praised by King George V for her outdoor recordings at the Harrison\u2019s home at Foyle Riding in Oxted, Surrey of cello works mingled with nightingale songs.According to Katrina Fountain who wrote a biographical sketch of the Harrison sisters:\nHowever much we admire the soloists of today, things will never be the same as during the lifetime of the Harrison family. They dedicated their lives to the cause of music, paving the way for a generation of women musicians. They gained the respect of the leading composers and performers of their day and set a musical precedent in the history of English music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Harrison", "response": ["Margaret Harrison (born 1940 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England) is an English feminist and artist whose work uses a variety of media and subject matter.", "A retrospective of her work \u201cMargaret Harrison: Dialogues Between Sex, Class and Violence\u201d  was held from October 2017 \u2013 January 2018 at the Azkuna Zentroa, Bilbao.", "* Margaret Harrison interviewed by Francis Kavanagh for Artists Insight, April 2011"]}, {"page": "May Harrison", "response": ["In 1900, May Harrison vied against 3,000 male and female musicians of all ages in the Associated Board's Senior Department, taking home the Gold Medal when she was just ten years old.
