Profoundly deaf and widowed at a young age, she operated a home for women and children, and then later for disabled children. She participated in the Women's Tax Resistance League and was jailed for her refusal to pay tax if she were not allowed the right to vote. She was the first person imprisoned for failure to pay a tax under the Insurance Act.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Women's Tax Resistance League", "response": ["*Kate Harvey", "* \"Women's suffrage movement: The story of Kate Harvey\" The Independent 24 November 2005"]}, {"page": "Charlotte Despard", "response": ["From 1912 to 1921, she worked with Kate Harvey, another pacifist feminist and tax resister, along with other prominent members like Sophia Duleep Singh. She wrote in her diary re Kate Harvey that \"the anniversary of our love\" began on 12 January 1912, though it remains unclear the extent of what she meant by the words. Kate Harvey converted her house, Brackenhill, in Highland Road, Bromley, to a thirty-one-bed hospital, initially intended for wounded soldiers in World War I. However, refugee women and children were sent there instead. Despard and Harvey bought a 12-acre tract in Upper Hartfield, which they also called 'Brackenhill'. Previously, Harvey had become involved in Theosophy, as did Despard and the children from Bromley were transferred to The Cloisters, an open-air school dedicated to that cause in Letchworth. The School in Hartfield became an Open Air School, which closed in 1939."]}, {"page": "Felicia Catherine Glanvill", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kate Harvey"]}, {"page": "Felicia Kate Harvey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kate Harvey"]}, {"page": "Katherine Felicia Harvey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kate Harvey"]}, {"page": "Catherine Felicia Harvey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kate Harvey"]}, {"page": "Women's Coronation Procession", "response": ["Kate Harvey, Edith Downing and Marion Wallace-Dunlop were among the organisers, and Lolita Roy is believed to have been as well.
