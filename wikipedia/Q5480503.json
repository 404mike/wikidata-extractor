It wasn't until ten games into the 1921\u201322 campaign that McNab nailed a permanent role in manager David Ashworth's plans but only after Jack Bamber and Francis Checkland had started the first fixtures; he took his chance well and only missed four of the remaining matches in the first of the back-to-back title winning seasons. McNab added a second winner's medal to his collection when he missed just tyree matches of the 1922\u201323  season."]}, {"page": "Checkland", "response": ["* Francis Checkland (born 1897), English footballer"]}]}}
