Reed has been called \"the last great exponent\" of the Gilbert and Sullivan comedy roles.The son of a butcher from County Durham, Reed began performing at the end of World War II, joining the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1951.  After eight years as understudy to Peter Pratt, he became the principal comedian of the company in 1959, remaining for two decades, playing all the famous Gilbert and Sullivan patter roles, including Sir Joseph in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance, Bunthorne in Patience, the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, Ko-Ko in The Mikado, Jack Point in The Yeomen of the Guard and the Duke of Plaza Toro in The Gondoliers, among others.  He was known for his \"fleet-footed clowning\", dry and roguish wit, comic timing, \"crystal clear diction\" in the patter songs, and his amusing character voice, recording all of his principal roles with the company.\nIn 1979, Reed left the company but continued performing in and directing Gilbert and Sullivan productions in Britain and America, as well as appearing in other light opera.  He retired to Halifax, West Yorkshire, directing amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies and attending the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton for many years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1916", "response": ["* February 13 \u2013 John Reed, British actor and opera singer (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Major-General||Martyn Green||Peter Pratt||John Reed||James Conroy-Ward||Alistair Donkin"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Ko-Ko||Peter Pratt||John Reed||John Reed||James Conroy-Ward", "In 1966, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a film version of The Mikado that closely reflected their traditional staging, although there are some minor cuts.
