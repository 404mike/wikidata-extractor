The hall was built for Sir Edmund Bedingfeld who obtained a licence to crenellate in 1482. The Bedingfelds gained the manor of Oxborough through marriage in the early 15th century, and the family has lived at the hall since its construction, although ownership passed to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in 1952. The house underwent extensive refurbishment in the mid 19th century under John Chessell Buckler and Augustus Pugin.", "An example of a late medieval, inward-facing great house, Oxburgh stands within a square moat about 75 metres on each side, and was originally enclosed; the hall range facing the gatehouse was pulled down in 1772 for Sir Richard Bedingfeld, providing a more open U-shaped house, with the open end of the U facing south. The entrance, reached by a three-arched bridge on the north side, is through a fortified gatehouse, described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \"the most prominent of the English brick gatehouses of the 15th century\". The gate was designed to evoke the owner's power and prestige, though as fortification its value is largely symbolic; it is flanked by tall polygonal towers rising in seven tiers, with symmetrical wings extending either side that reveal nothing on the exterior of their differing internal arrangements. About 1835 the open end of the U was filled in with a picturesque, by no means archaeologically correct range that recreated the central courtyard. Other Victorian additions include the Flemish-style stepped gables, the massive southeast tower, the  oriel windows overhanging the moat and terracotta chimneys. Four towers were added to the walled kitchen garden. In the 1830s under Sir Henry Richard Paston-Bedingfield, John Chessell Buckler and Augustus Pugin were commissioned to restore and develop the hall. A chapel was added, and the walled kitchen garden and flower gardens were rebuilt. A stable block was also added.", "Category:John Chessell Buckler buildings"]}, {"page": "Sutton Place, Surrey", "response": ["The architect was Charles Alban Buckler.

The poet John Betjeman said that the front of the college opposite Exeter College was \"a good specimen\" of Gothic Revival work.Betjeman, p. 141 In contrast, the architectural historian Geoffrey Tyack noted that the refacing came not long after the two other colleges in Turl Street (Exeter and Lincoln) had been refaced, and commented that Buckler's work, in \"Collegiate Gothic\" style, \"completed a process whereby the fa\u00e7ades of the colleges in Turl Street acquired a somewhat lifeless homogeneity which they had never possessed in the past\".Tyack, p. 221 W. J. Arkell wrote that \"some of the worst horrors of the Gothic revival\" cluster on either side of Turl Street.Arkell, p. 98 When writing a history of the college in 1891, the vice-principal Llewellyn Thomas said that the work was \"admitted to be very well done\", but that there were those who thought that \"the old Jacobean gateway was more in harmony with the domestic architecture of the College, and more suitable to its position in a narrow street\".Thomas, p. 387 The stonework on the front of the college was last cleaned in 2000, when the porters' lodge by the Turl Street entrance was also rebuilt, to provide better office accommodation for the porters, individual post boxes for students, and greater security.
