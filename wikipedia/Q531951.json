Pitter's involvement in the move \"would have lent it a reassuring respectability in Mrs. Blair's eyes.\" Pitter had a sympathetic interest in Blair's writing, pointed out weaknesses in his poetry, and advised him to write about what he knew. In fact he decided to write of \"certain aspects of the present that he set out to know\" and ventured into the East End of London\u2014the first of the occasional sorties he would make to discover for himself the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit it.

Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman.
