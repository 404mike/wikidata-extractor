In the first innings against Nottinghamshire he took 5 for 14, but in the second innings Ted Alletson hit one of his overs for 34 runs. For 57 years, this was the most runs scored in an over of first-class cricket, until it was surpassed in 1968 by Garry Sobers, who hit 36 off Malcolm Nash.In the United Kingdom, wearing glasses was characterised in the nineteenth century, as \"a sure sign of the weakling and the mollycoddle\", according to Neville Cardus, writing in 1928. Tim Killick was the first professional cricketer to play while wearing glasses \"continuously\", after his vision deteriorated in 1897. \"With their aid he placed himself in the forefront among English professionals of all-round abilities.\u201dHis uncle, Harry Killick, also played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 34 || 4\u00a06\u00a06\u00a00\u00a04\u00a04\u00a04\u00a06(2 no-balls) || Ted Alletson (Nottinghamshire) || Ernest Killick (Sussex) || Sussex v NottinghamshireNottinghamshire won the toss and batted first, scoring 238 (Ernest Killick took five for 14).

Monty Noble recorded his highest career score, making 284 and sharing a partnership of 428 with Warwick Armstrong, a new sixth-wicket record for The County Ground at Hove, which has remained standing for over 100 years. Tate, the unlucky man from the Fourth Test, bowled 41 overs without reward, while Albert Relf took four wickets before meeting Noble and Armstrong. Noble was eventually stumped off Ernest Killick, leaving a declaration.

Against Kent, he batted for most of Somerset's innings to score 93 runs without being dismissed, almost half of his team's total, to help Somerset recover from 12 for 5 to post 194. He added a further 45 runs in the second innings, but despite his efforts, Somerset lost by 145 runs. In his next match, Roe posted a low score in the first innings, but recorded his second century in first-class cricket in the second innings to help Somerset secure a draw. He scored 106 runs, including six boundaries. Against Sussex in the next game, Roe scored an unbeaten 85, but was overshadowed by scores of 154 and 156 by Richard and Lionel Palairet, and 191 by Sussex's Ernest Killick.
