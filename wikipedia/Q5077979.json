He was a popular author in the UK, the United States and translated around the world. He was \u2018the most successful novelist in England\u2019, according to Arnold Bennett in 1910. He published novels selling over seven million copies worldwide by 1914, and since 1913 he was selling 1.75 million books annually, a pace which he maintained at least until his death.
