In 1881 at the age of 16, Charlesworth was a clerk.Charlesworth played three matches for Derbyshire in the 1888 season, the first of the seasons when they lost first-class status and made little impression. Charlesworth reappeared for Derbyshire in the 1898 season, making his first-class debut against Essex. Despite being absent hurt in the first innings, he returned during Derbyshire's attempt at bowling out a high-scoring Essex team, in which every player but wicket-keeper Solomon Hardy and opener Sydney Evershed had a crack at bowling, in many cases economical but unsuccessful. Charlesworth played six more first-class matches for the club in the season. He only bowled again in a draw against Nottinghamshire. His last match was against Yorkshire in what remains the highest score against Derbyshire. He was absent hurt again in this match, this time in the second innings.\nCharlesworth was a lower-order/tailend batsman and played ten innings in seven first-class matches with an average of 10.22 and a top score of 23. He bowled sixty balls at the cost of 47 runs without taking a wicket.Charlesworth died in St-Anne's-on-Sea, now part of Lytham St Annes at the age of 63.", "link_mentions": {}}}
