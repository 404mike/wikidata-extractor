On the outbreak of the Second World War, Fawkes was first employed painting camouflage on factory roofs to hide them from enemy bombing.  A bout of pleurisy made Fawkes unfit for service and he was instead employed by the Coal Commission to work on maps of coal seams.  In 1942, he entered an art competition that was judged by the Daily Mail's chief cartoonist Leslie Gilbert Illingworth, who found him work with the Clement Davies advertising agency.  In 1945, Illingworth found Fawkes work at the Daily Mail drawing column-breaks and decorative illustrations."]}, {"page": "Illingworth", "response": ["*Leslie Gilbert Illingworth (1902\u20131979) British cartoonist"]}, {"page": "1979 in Wales", "response": ["*20 December - Leslie Gilbert Illingworth, political cartoonist, 77"]}, {"page": "1902 in Wales", "response": ["*2 September \u2013 Leslie Gilbert Illingworth, political cartoonist (died 1979)"]}, {"page": "Cardiff School of Art & Design", "response": ["*Leslie Gilbert Illingworth, Chief Cartoonist at Punch magazine"]}, {"page": "List of Desert Island Discs episodes (1961\u20131970)", "response": ["|||Leslie Gilbert Illingworth||Instructions for making a still||Painting materials|| more"]}, {"page": "Leslie Illingworth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leslie Gilbert Illingworth"]}, {"page": "David Gwilym John", "response": ["John was born to Catherine and William John at Pancross in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales in the early months of 1884.
