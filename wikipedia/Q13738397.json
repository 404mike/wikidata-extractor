He turned professional in 1935 and took up a job in the local golf club shop. After serving in the army during World War II, he went on to win many prestigious tournaments including the 1956 PGA Match Play Championship, the 1950 Silver King Tournament, the 1951 Daks Tournament and the 1952 North British-Harrogate Tournament. He also won the Woodlawn Invitation Open in Germany for three consecutive years from 1958. In Scotland, he dominated, with eight victories in the Scottish Professionals Championship and seven in the Northern Open between 1948 and 1962.In addition to tournament golf, Panton also served as a club professional at Glenbervie Golf Club until 1984. Later in his career, he won the PGA Seniors Championship twice, in 1967 and 1969, and the World Senior Championship in 1967, defeating Sam Snead 3 and 2 in the final.\nPanton was appointed honorary professional to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1988, a position he held until his retirement in 2006. In 2005, he was made an honorary life member of the European Tour.As well as his Ryder Cup appearances in 1951, 1953 and 1961, Panton also represented Scotland 13 times in the World Cup between 1955 and 1968.\nPanton's daughter, Catherine Panton-Lewis, is a professional golfer and was a founding member of the Ladies European Tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Alliss", "response": ["|  John Panton"]}, {"page": "Skip Alexander", "response": ["On September 24, 1950, Alexander was the lone survivor of a plane crash in Evansville, Indiana, in which he was severely burned over 70% of his body.  After 17 operations, one of which was to permanently freeze his badly burned fingers around the grip of a golf club instead of removing them, he returned to help the United States win the 1951 Ryder Cup.  Sam Snead, the Ryder Cup captain that year, paired Alexander against the British champion, John Panton, in the singles portion of the competition.  Although the thought was that it might well be a throwaway match, it would at least save their other players from playing Panton, who was beating everyone at that time.  Alexander, with both hands bleeding, won the match by the largest margin in Ryder Cup history to that point, 8 & 7."]}, {"page": "Irish Open (golf)", "response": ["When the event resumed at Portmarnock in 1946, Fred Daly became the first Irish winner.
