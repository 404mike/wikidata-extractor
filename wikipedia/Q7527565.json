Aubrey was also Member of Parliament for Aldeburgh from 1796 to 1812, for Steyning from 1812 to 1820 and for Horsham from 1820 to 1826, eventually becoming the Father of the House as the longest-serving member. He died in Dorton House in Buckinghamshire and was buried in Boarstall. He was succeeded by his nephew Thomas Aubrey.\nOn 9 March 1771, he married firstly Mary Colebrooke, daughter of Sir James Colebrooke, 1st Baronet and on 26 May 1783 secondly his cousin Martha Catherine (d. 1815), daughter of George Richard Carter, of Chilton, Buckinghamshire, and a descendant, through her mother, Julia (n\u00e9e Spilman), of the Willys baronets.

In 1257 John Morel granted parts of Oakley and Addingrove to John FitzNeil, who then bought the remainder of the manorial tenure from Morel's heirs. Thereafter the tenancy of Addingrove was linked with that of Boarstall until 1563. From 1554 the farm was let to John Croke of Chilton. Croke left the tenancy to his son, also John Dormer, who in 1607 was renting the farm from Sir John Dormer of Dorton. Dormer left Addingrove to his son Sir Robert Dormer, who is said to have passed it to a family called Mitchell. In the 18th century Addingrove passed from Richard Mitchell to Sir John Aubrey, 6th Baronet. Aubrey held the manor of Boarstall, so thereafter Addingrove was once again linked with that manor."]}, {"page": "Aubrey baronets", "response": ["* Sir John Aubrey, 6th Baronet (1739\u20131826)"]}, {"page": "John Aubrey (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Sir John Aubrey, 6th Baronet (1739\u20131826), British MP for Wallingford, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, Clitheroe, Aldeburgh, Steyning, and Horsham"]}]}}
