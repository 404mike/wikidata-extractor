A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the market town of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as Old Harlow, and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and pubs. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, Leonard Manasseh, Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew, Graham Dawbarn, H. T. Cadbury-Brown and William Crabtree.  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.  The cycle network is composed mostly of the original old town roads."]}, {"page": "1959 in architecture", "response": ["* 6 Bacon's Lane, Highgate, London, designed by architect Leonard Manasseh for himself."]}, {"page": "1960 in architecture", "response": ["* Rutherford School, Paddington, London, designed by architects Leonard Manasseh and Ian Baker."]}, {"page": "1951 in architecture", "response": ["** '51 Bar by Leonard Manasseh and Ian Baker."]}, {"page": "Frederick Gibberd", "response": ["A further achievement by Gibberd in planning Harlow is his incorporation of works by many leading architects of the post-war years, such as FRS Yorke, Powell & Moya, Graham Dawbarn, John Poulson, Maxwell Fry & Jane Drew, Michael Neylan, William Crabtree, Leonard Manasseh, ECP Monson, Gerard Goalen, Gerald Lacoste, Richard Sheppard and H.
