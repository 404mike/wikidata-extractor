In 1998, Cardiff University and King's College London joined the group. In March 2001, the Russell Group decided against selecting a preferred option for the future funding of higher education, stating that endowments, a graduate contribution, increased public funding and top-up fees should all remain options. In December 2005, it was announced that the Russell Group would be appointing its first full-time director-general as a result of a planned expansion of its operations, including commissioning and conducting its own policy research. In November 2006, Queen's University Belfast was admitted as the twentieth member of the group. In the same month Wendy Piatt, the then deputy director in the Prime Minister's strategy unit, was announced as the group's new Director General and chief executive."]}, {"page": "Piatt", "response": ["*Wendy Piatt (born 1976), British director"]}, {"page": "Upton Hall School FCJ", "response": ["* Wendy Piatt, Director General since 2007 of the Russell Group"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Wendy Piatt \u2013 Director General of The Russell Group"]}, {"page": "Timeline of tuition fees in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In their Changing Landscapes report published in 2009, Universities UK said that \"in practice, although institutions theoretically had the choice whether to charge the full tuition fee, almost all chose to set the fee at the \u00a33,000 cap\".Universities UK | changing landscapes report Page 7 It also said that the \"current fee arrangements\" had not \"created an economic market in which the price of an institution is a significant factor in how potential students choose the institution they want to go to and in which institutions compete on price to attract students.\" In their Conclusions on the Changing Market they said that raising tuition fees to \u00a35,000 a year would be just the \"maintenance of the status quo\" and claimed that \"students are insensitive to tuition fees below this level.\" The report suggested that \"increasing fees above \u00a35,000 would lead more and more institutions to review their practice of setting fees below the cap\".Universities UK | changing landscapes report page 18, section 2.4 Responding to the report Wendy Piatt, Director General of the Russell Group who represent 20 British universities, said \"There is a growing consensus that without increased investment, there is a real danger that the success of our world-leading universities will not be sustained. In a difficult economic climate there is even greater urgency to find additional funding\". She quoted research from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) which said that universities needed an additional 15-20 percent worth of funding for current teaching levels to be sustained and suggested that an increase in tuition fees should be something that should be an option as the increase in 2006 had no adverse impact on recruitment.", "Speaking on the launch of the review, National Union of Students President Wes Streeting said \"there is a real danger that this review will pave the way for higher fees and a market in prices that would see poorer students priced out of more prestigious universities and other students and universities consigned to the 'bargain basement'\". However, the Russell Group's Wendy Piatt argued that the current level of funding was inadequate, saying \"as universities are facing severe economic conditions and ferocious global competition it is clear that the status quo is not viable\"."]}]}}
