Turandot, is a proud, cruel Chinese princess who refuses to marry any suitors unless they can answer three impossible riddles. When they fail, she has them executed. But Calaf, Prince of Astrakhan, manages to woo her (\"Turandot or death!\"), answers the riddles, and wins her hand in marriage. The play was originally written to be performed in the small theatre of San Samuele in Venice, and was deliberately written in the commedia dell'arte style as a reaction to the more modern, realistic plays of his rival Goldoni.Ashbrook and Powers (1991), pp. 44 and 58", "Although Busoni had refused to cut the score of his music for Turandot or reduce the size of the orchestra, he did agree to a Reinhardt request for more music. In 1911 he composed Verzweiflung und Ergebung (\"Despair and Resignation\", BV 248a) to be played between acts IV and V; he also added it between nos. 7 and 8 of the already lengthy Turandot Suite.Kindermann, p. 230.

This is my first encounter with the blacklist-whitelist concept, but I have to say, blacklisting such an excellent source of information about recordings seems fairly disruptive to me. I've done a lot of work on discographies for various classical musicians. Here is an example of an article that is affected: Antony Beaumont. It was when I tried to edit that page today that I encountered the problem. Not only this site \"theclassicalmusicshop.net\", but other similar ones which apparently have a good chance of ending up on this list, frequently provide useful material, including detailed track lists, artists, dates and locations of recordings, and often and not the least important, downloadable CD booklets which contain much information on the music, composers, and artists. If one incorporates this information into an article, one should quite properly provide a link to the product page with the information about the recording, and/or link to the booklet which was the source for the information. It will be very inconvenient and discouraging to good editing to require that each editor obtain an exception each time that editor would like to link to this site.

The article on Antony Beaumont also includes an effective and descriptive blockquote from Kirkus Reviews that I picked up on a product page at that site.
