It was originally called 'The Grove' after the print works and was the home of a mayor of Stockport, Alfred Orell, who died in the year of its completion. Abney was sold to James Watts (later Sir James Watts) who rebuilt the upper storey and added two short wings in the early 1850s. The architects for the alterations were Travis and Magnall, the Manchester firm that designed the Watts Warehouse on Portland Street in Manchester. However, hardly was the work by Travis and Magnall complete, when James Watts was inspired to engage the architect and designer A. W. N. Pugin and his colleagues, who had created the Gothic Court at the 1851 Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace, to make further substantial alterations.", "James Watts was responsible for renaming it 'Abney Hall' after, in the words of his son, \"Sir Thomas Abney who entertained Sir [actually Rev. Dr.] Isaac Watts for thirty years\".", "After his parents died, James Watts sold Abney Hall in 1958 for \u00a314,000 to Cheadle and Gatley Urban District Council, which adapted it and opened it as Cheadle Town Hall in 1959. Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council took it over in 1974 and moved much of the remaining historical furniture from the hall to Bramall Hall and Lyme Hall. Parts of the grounds were sold until about a tenth of the original area remains. The hall is used as offices, though it is generally opened to the public under the auspices of the Civic Trust's Heritage Open Days scheme in September, and the grounds are open to the public all year round. The Hall is mostly locked to the public since recent years due to the offices, with hall owners Bruntwood renovating the hall in 2014 and APS relocating their offices into the hall in September 2014. During filming for BBC drama series Our Zoo, flagstones surrounding Abney Hall were accidentally damaged during filming of the show in April 2014. Developments continued on the hall's grounds, with the September 2015 opening of the Abney Court Care Home built in the former walled garden of Abney Hall.", "The last private owner of Abney Hall was the great grandchild of Sir James Watts (1804\u20131878). He was also named James Watts and was the only nephew of Agatha Christie; his father, also named James Watts, married Agatha's sister, Margaret Frary Miller in 1902. Mrs. Christie often visited the Hall and wrote two stories from there: the novel After the Funeral and the short story \"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\", which is part of a collection of short stories of the same name. The Hall was also used as a basis for Chimneys, a country house and seat of the fictional Marquesses of Caterham, in The Secret of Chimneys (Christie dedicated this novel to her nephew) and The Seven Dials Mystery. Many references to various places around Cheadle can be found in her books.
