Three new signings were announced at the same time as Scally's takeover and the appointment of Pulis: forward Leo Fortune-West joined from non-League club Stevenage Borough for a transfer fee of \u00a35,000, which was donated by Gillingham's official supporters' club from funds collected earlier in the year as part of its efforts to save the club, goalkeeper Jim Stannard was signed from Fulham, and Kevin Rattray arrived from non-League club Woking.  Subsequent signings included midfielder Mark O'Connor, who had previously played for the club between 1989 and 1993; he had played under Pulis's management at Bournemouth.  Midfielder Dave Martin joined from Bristol City on a free transfer and was immediately installed as the new club captain.  Simon Ratcliffe joined from Brentford, and shortly before the first match of the season, Mark Harris and Dominic Naylor arrived from Swansea City and Plymouth Argyle respectively.  The team prepared for the new season with a number of friendly matches, including one against Premier League club Chelsea, who sent a full-strength team including high-profile new signings  Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes.  The match drew a crowd of over 10,000, with many more turned away, and provided a significant funding boost for the club.  Gillingham adopted a new first-choice kit featuring blue and black striped shirts; the second-choice shirts, to be worn in the event of a clash of colours with the opposition, were red and black.  The team were forced to wear the previous season's kit for the first four games, however, as the suppliers of the new kit failed to deliver it on time."]}, {"page": "2000 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|6||DF|| Mark Harris"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["Gillingham ended the winless run with a victory over Peterborough United on 19 November, despite goalkeeper Jim Stannard suffering an injury and defender Mark Harris having to take over in goal.  Pulis quickly signed goalkeeper Andy Marshall on loan from Norwich City and he saved a penalty on his debut against York City, but Gillingham lost both that game and the next one, after which they had dropped to 20th in the table.  The team began December with a win over Crewe Alexandra and followed the victory with draws against two teams who were in the top six of the league table, Bury and Watford.  It was the first time that the team had gone three consecutive league games without losing during the season.  This short unbeaten run was followed, however, by a defeat at home to Luton Town on Boxing Day.  Gillingham's final match of 1996 was away to Burnley, who won 5\u20131; Onuora was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for angrily throwing the ball at the assistant referee.  The defeat left Gillingham 21st in the table, putting them in the relegation places."]}]}}
