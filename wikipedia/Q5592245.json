He is a specialist in mediaeval language and literature, with interests in the Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Iceland, Greenland and the North Atlantic. Publications include Germanic linguistics and dialectology, mediaeval history of the North Atlantic Region, English literature criticism, and genealogy. Davis received a PhD from University of St. Andrews, and has taught at Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Northumbria.He and Karl Bernhardt are the editor of the linguistics monograph series Contemporary Studies in Descriptive Linguistics and Studies in Historical Linguistics.

Indeed it would not be inappropriate to regard them as dialects of one language. They are undoubtedly far closer one to another than are the various dialects of modern Chinese, for example. A reasonable modern analogy might be Arabic, where considerable dialectical diversity exists but within the concept of a single Arabic language.\" In: "]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", "response": ["Writing after all seven books had been published, Graeme Davis regarded Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny."]}, {"page": "Journal of Language and Linguistics", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graeme Davis (mediaevalist)"]}, {"page": "Frankish language", "response": ["The language spoken by the Franks was part of the West Germanic language group, which had features from Proto-Germanic in the late Jastorf culture (ca. 1st century BC). The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North and East Germanic. The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic), Istvaeonic (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and Irminonic (Elbe Germanic). While each had its own distinct characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. In fact, it is unclear whether the West Germanic continuum of this time period, or indeed Franconian itself, should still be considered a single language or if it should be considered a collection of similar dialects.Graeme Davis (2006:154) notes \"the languages of the Germanic group in the Old period are much closer than has previously been noted.
