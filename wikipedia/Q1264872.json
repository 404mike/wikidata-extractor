Lulu Haroutunian has discussed Camus' own medical history, including a bout with tuberculosis, and how it informs the novel.

Marina Warner (a literary critic rather than Assyriologist) claims that early Christians in the Middle East assimilated elements of Ishtar into the cult of the Virgin Mary. She argues that the Syrian writers Jacob of Serugh and Romanos the Melodist both wrote laments in which the Virgin Mary describes her compassion for her son at the foot of the cross in deeply personal terms closely resembling Ishtar's laments over the death of Tammuz. However, broad comparisons between Tammuz and other dying gods are rooted in the work of James George Frazer and are regarded as a relic of less rigorous early 20th century Assyriology by more recent publications."]}, {"page": "Lady Godiva", "response": ["Some historians have discerned elements of pagan fertility rituals in the Godiva story, whereby a young \"May Queen\" was led to the sacred Cofa's tree, perhaps to celebrate the renewal of spring.Marina Warner.
