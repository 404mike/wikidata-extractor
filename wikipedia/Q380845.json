Those who considered leaving perhaps believed their souls may be damned for spiritual dereliction. Some refused to leave their cells even when pirates or looters were pillaging their towns, and consequently burned to death when the church was torched. They ate frugal meals, spending their days both in contemplative prayer and interceding on behalf of others. Their body waste was managed by means of a chamber pot. Some anchorholds had a few small rooms, or attached gardens. Servants tended to the basic needs of anchorites, providing food and water, and removing waste. Julian of Norwich, for example, is known to have had several maidservants, among them Sara and Alice. Aelred of Rievaulx wrote an anchorite rule book, , for his recluse sister, titled De Institutione Inclusarum; in it, he suggested keeping no housemates other than an old woman, to act as companion and doorkeeper, and a young maid as domestic servant.", "An idea of their daily routine can be gleaned from an anchoritic rule. The most widely known today is the early 13th-century text known as Ancrene Wisse.Ancrene Wisse Another, less widely known, example is the rule known as De Institutione Inclusarum written in the 12th\u00a0century, around 1160\u20131162, by Aelred of Rievaulx for his sister.A translation of De Institutione Inclusarum by Mary Paul MacPherson is included in Treatises and the Pastoral Prayer, Cistercian Fathers Series\u00a02, (Kalamazoo, 1971). In English the work is variously titled The Eremitical Life, The Rule of Life for a Recluse, or The Training of Anchoresses.

Arndt influenced Spener, who formed a group known as the collegia pietatis (\"college of piety\") that stressed the role of spiritual direction among lay-people\u2014a practice with a long tradition going back to Aelred of Rievaulx and known in Spener's own time from the work of Francis de Sales.
