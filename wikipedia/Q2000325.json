Harington, writing in 1605, referred to a man who lived longer than 140 years, and to a woman, \"and she a countess,\" who lived longer than 120.

Crossref muslin which entered English and other Western languages about the same time. In English the early records are in travellers' reports and among the earliest is this comment from an English traveller in the Middle East in 1615: \"All of them wear on their heads white shashes.... Shashes are long towels of Calico wound about their heads.\"The quote is from \"A relation of a journey begun in 1610... containing a description of the Turkish Empire, of Egypt, of the Holy Land...\", by George Sandys, first published in 1615: online. In the Middle East around that time it was the custom for men to wear a turban that consisted of about seven meters of fine lightweight muslin cloth wound around the head. Another traveller's description was given by Fynes Moryson in 1617: Fynes Moryson's Itinerary, 1617. More quotations of early use of \"s[h]ash\" in English are in NED (year 1914). In the later 17th century in English, \"shash\" still had that original meaning, and additionally it took on the meaning of a ribbon of fine cloth wrapped around the waist. About the beginning of the early 18th century the predominant wordform in English changed from \"shash\" to \"sash\".John Kersey's English dictionary of 1708 and Nathan Bailey's English dictionary of 1726 have \"shash\" defined as \"the linen of which a Turkish turbant is made; also a kind of girdle made of silk, etc. to tie about the waist\" (online in Bailey's). Those dictionaries have a separate entry for \"sash\" which they define as \"a sort of girdle\" [girdle = a band around the waist] (online in Bailey's). Roman Catholic and Anglican clergy sometimes wore a sash wrapped around the waist or midriff (see fascia). In a book about the clergy by John Eachard published in 1685 the word is spelled \"shash\" (ref), but the spelling was changed to \"sash\" in the 1705 edition of the same book (ref). The change in English from earlier \"shash\" to later \"sash\" is a case of phonetic dissimilation, says Weekley (1921).
