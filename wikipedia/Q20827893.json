He taught himself entomology, wrote a monograph on the scale insects and later served as a professor of medical entomology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\nNewstead was born in Swanton Abbott, Norfolk where his father worked as a butler to Boulton of Oulton Hall. His father later became a gardener at Sedgeford and young Newstead was introduced early to the world of plants and natural history. Newstead went to school but quit at the age of ten to work as a gardener, followed by work in a press, and as a telegraphist. He returned to gardening in 1883 for Osten Walker, an amateur naturalist. Walker paid for his studies and encouraged him to work at the newly founded Grosvenor Museum, Chester. He also encouraged Newstead to study the scale insects which built his repute as an entomologist. He was then given a grant to collect Coccidae from around Britain. For some time, Newstead worked as an assistant to Eleanor Ormerod, helping her compile lists of injurious insects for her annual reports. In 1905 he became a lecturer in medical entomology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and in 1911 he held the Dutton Chair of Entomology at Liverpool. During World War I, he was involved in insect control on the front in France and Flanders.  Newstead also took an interest in archaeology, especially working on the digs to examine the Roman remains in Chester between 1926 and 1929. He served as Chester City Magistrate from 1913 to 1946.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| Robert Newstead||02/05/1912||12 September 1859 \u2013 17 February 1947"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1912", "response": ["*Robert Newstead"]}, {"page": "Charles William Mason", "response": ["Mason was born in Surbiton, Surrey to engineer William Joshua and Eliza Emily n\u00e9e Walters. He studied at Haileybury College and went to work at the Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa in 1906. From 1907, as first supernumerary entomologist, he conducted studies on the food of birds in India, examining the gut contents of 1325 birds. This was used to classify the birds as harmful, beneficial or neutral in terms of their role in agriculture. He made use of numerical counts of food items eaten, following a system of Robert Newstead , rather than quantify them by biomass. He identified that birds did not play a role as destroyers of weeds through seed eating. The report was published in 1911, coauthored with the Imperial Entomologist, Harold Maxwell-Lefroy. He trained at the Southeastern Agricultural College, Wye in 1910 and in July 1913, he went to study entomology as a Carnegie student at the laboratory of parasitology of the Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of Agriculture at Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts, before moving to Nyasaland (Malawi) to succeed Edward Ballard as Government Entomologist. He also served with the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve. He died of black-water fever (malaria) at the Government Farm, Namiwawa, Malawi."]}]}}
