Under the captaincy of Frank Gordon the team would later go on a 22-month unbeaten run, from December 1903 through to October 1905. During this period Swansea appeared to be under-represented at international level.

Like many successful players from the area, once Jones had been noticed as a rugby talent, he progressed to Neath RFC, the most notable club in the region. In the 1903-04 season, Neath made Jones the captain of the Neath senior XV. As captain of Neath, Jones was selected for his one and only international appearance, playing for Wales in the country's final game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship. Wales had already played England and Scotland, registering a draw and a win, meaning a win over Ireland would give Wales the possibility of winning the Championship. The Welsh selectors had brought in new capped players throughout the campaign and the final game was no exception. Jones was one of three players who were representing Wales for the first time during the Irish game and the tenth of the tournament. All three new caps were in the forward positions, and Jones was joined by Newport's Charlie Pritchard and Sid Bevan from Swansea. The game ended controversially, with the match referee blames for allowing Ireland a try from an illegal forward pass, and then denying Welsh wing Dick Jones a winning try. Wales finished the 1904 Championship in second and Jones was never selected to play for Wales again."]}]}}
