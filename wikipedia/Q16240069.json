Both the World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have denounced the use of the \"Yid\", \"Yiddo\" and \"Yid army\" by fans. Some Jewish fans of the club, however, have written in support of its use, including Simon Schama, Frank Furedi, Gerald Jacobs and David Aaronovitch. The Prime Minister David Cameron argued that there is \"a difference between Spurs fans self-describing themselves as Yids and someone calling someone a Yid as an insult\" as its use by the Spurs fans is not motivated by hate and therefore cannot be considered hate speech. Attempts to prosecute Tottenham fans who chanted the words have failed, as the Crown Prosecution Service considered that the words as used by Tottenham fans could not be judged legally \"threatening, abusive or insulting\". and the Metropolitan Police no longer regards the chanting of \"Yid\" by Tottenham fans an arrestable offence."]}]}}
