Scherstuhl said it is scattershot, \"a litany of Things We Can All Agree Are Bad\", but ultimately jumps between several topicswithout sufficient detail, in his opinionbut comes to no conclusion or alternative. Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged and that they would \"dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is\". Similarly, while saying the film discusses important issues, both Genevieve Koski of The Dissolve and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them. Koski said, \"The True Cost is methodical to a fault\", while Kermode said it is \"a good starting point\" on the topic. Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said it has an \"easy-to-swallow accessibility\" but that it \"oversimplifies\" some aspects of the industry. In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for \"lots of eye-popping statements\", she said, \"trying to do everything, he skirted a lot of things\". The Los Angeles Timess Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers, saying \"the effects of fertilizers\u00a0...\u00a0don't appear quite as tangible\", and faulted Morgan for not exploring \"retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins\", but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both pro and con views. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he wants to go back to the 1960s. She also criticized some interviewees, such as Miller, whom she called a \"conspiracy theorist\", and Wolff, whom she called a \"Marxist idealist\". Crocker was dismissive of the film, saying, \"the film loses focus and credibility, criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it\"."]}, {"page": "Black Is King", "response": ["English film critic Mark Kermode, in an episode of Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema, characterized Black Is King as a \"perfect union of film and popular music\", describing it as a \"lavish... immersive and eclectic experience\" that perfectly captured the zeitgeist of 2020. Writing for Decider, Anna Menta called Black Is King \"an undeniably breathtaking, personal, and political work of art\". Describing it as \"a visual masterpiece\" that is \"almost overwhelming\", Menta praised the many settings and outfits in the film and noted that every detail on screen had meaning. Niellah Arboine of The Independent said Black Is King shows Beyonc\u00e9 at her most experimental, with a cinematographic style where \"every shot is a piece of art\" and music genres that the film \"seamlessly jumps through\". Arboine also praised how the film showcases a diverse range of elements that constitute blackness, such as black debutante balls, London council estates and durags. Odie Henderson of RogerEbert.com described the film as a \"jaw-dropping visual achievement\", applauding the cinematographers who provided a wide variety of \"stunning visuals\" that cohere as a whole. Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen of The Sydney Morning Herald agreed, writing that the film \"takes the viewer on a dazzling, hyper-real ride through natural landscapes and space-age futures, while incorporating elements of black history and tradition\". Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic of The New York Times, commented that the \"overwhelming\" array of outfits are \"dazzling, but also calculated\", with all of them existing to serve the vision of Beyonc\u00e9 and reinforce her messages, while also \"reinforcing her position as the ultimate cultural tastemaker\"."]}, {"page": "Ari Seth Cohen", "response": ["Cohen studied art history at the University of Washington.

To cope with the loss, Cohen began street photography of people over the age of 60. This led to the creation of his Advanced Style blog in 2008. He features the style, creativity, and wisdom of fashion-minded individuals over the age of 60. In July 2015, Cohen relocated to Los Angeles. He has released three books featuring portraits and interviews and a coloring book as well. In 2014 Cohen released the Advanced Style documentary, which he made with director Lina Plioplyte, featuring the lives and style of many of his New York muses. The film played in theaters internationally and eventually on Netflix for several years after. Cohen has been invited to speak about his work all around the world, including a Ted X Amsterdam talk in 2014 and the Chicago Humanities Festival in 2020.
