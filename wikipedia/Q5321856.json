Pembroke found his fleet caught between the enemy and the sandbanks located off what later became La Pallice. The Castilian ships were equipped with arbalests, which caused great destruction to the wooden decks of the English ships. Pembroke was unable to replicate the victories of such earlier naval battles as  Winchelsea and N\u00e1jera) due to his lack of archers, which would otherwise have allowed him to lay down suppressing fire on the enemy crews. Similarly, the Castilian missile superiority meant that English soldiers were unable to board the Castilian ships. The battle lasted two days. The fighting broke off as night fell on the 22nd; Pembroke had lost two ships, and was now surrounded by the Castilian fleet overnight. Fighting recommenced the next morning. Pembroke found his flagship attacked by four of the enemy galleys, who used grappling hooks to attach themselves to the English ship, and later managed to douse the decks of some ships with oil which could then be ignited by fire arrows. Fire, said Sherborne, played a vital role in the Castilian triumph. Around this point\u2014with horses running wild and kicking holes in the hulls and his men throwing themselves overboard to avoid the flames\u2014Pembroke surrendered. Much of his fleet was burned or captured, many of his retinue were killed, and those who survived were captured. The Earl of Huntingdon was among those captured. The \u00a312,000 in silver was discovered and taken by the French.  Pembroke's actions at La Rochelle have been the subject of criticism by several historians; J. H. Ramsay described Pembroke's defeat as the worst ever inflicted on the English navy, E. F. Jacob that it was a disastrous blow, and Anthony Steel said that it lost England control of the English Channel for several years."]}, {"page": "John Jacob (East India Company officer)", "response": ["Among his descendants, were Lt.

Around 1405 Leonardo Bruni wrote De studies et letteris, addressed to Baptista di Montefeltro, the daughter of Antonio II da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino; it commends the study of Latin, but warns against arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and rhetoric. In discussing the classical scholar Isotta Nogarola, however, Lisa JardineWomen Humanists: Education for What?, pp. 48-81 in Feminism and Renaissance Studies (1999), edited by Lorna Hudson. notes that (in the middle of the 15th century), \u2018Cultivation\u2019 is in order for a noblewoman; formal competence is positively unbecoming. Christine de Pisan's Livre des Trois Vertus is contemporary with Bruni's book, and sets down the things which a lady or baroness living on her estates ought to be able to do.Eileen Power, The Position of Women, p. 418, in The Legacy of the Middle Ages (1926), edited by G.

Henry confirmed him in his \u00a340 annuity at this time. However, Henry Summerson has suggested that the reason for his presence in France rather than on the border was the result of the Southampton Plot against the King. The plot had been exposed to Henry just before the expedition sailed. Umfraville had been summoned\u2014\"by name\"\u2014to the King in August 1415, due to his military importance. This summons, says Summerson, was because Henry suspected Umfraville of \"harbouring a residual loyalty to the Percys\" and of \"thus of being sympathetic to the Southampton plot of 1415, whose aims included a Percy restoration.\" In July 1411, Umfraville had been appointed Captain of Roxburgh Castle for a six-year term. However, he had been relieved of his appointment just prior to his summons to the King. Since Umfraville was indentured by the King to serve abroad in the following year's campaign, he presumably had cleared himself of suspicion in the King's eyes, and in any case, by 1417 he had returned to the Northumberland and the border. The Duke of Albany had launched a \"foul raid\" on the county of Northumberland\u2014which broke the existing truce\u2014against Berwick that year. On 3 August Umfraville (as Chamberlain of Berwick and Captain of Roxburgh) was informed that Albany intended to invade England with an army of 60,000 and besiege Berwick. E. F. Jacob has suggested that the leaders of the Southampton Plot had expected Umfraville's support, but that, in the end, if he did let the Scots over the border, it was ultimately \"only to destroy them.\" Sir Robert led a series of retaliatory raids against Scotland in revenge, climaxing in 1419 with his assault upon the town of Peebles. As a result of his burning of the town on market day, Umfraville earned the moniker 'mendmarket.' John Hardyng's later verse proclaimed that Umfraville, being determined that not all the glory should be earned solely by those fighting the French, \"made the warre on Scottes to have a name\" for himself. As Alexander Rose put it, while Henry V was \"sacking Caen and advancing into undefended Bayeux and Lisieux... Sir Robert Umfraville, his most ruthless lieutenant [had] free rein to tear south-eastern Scotland savagely apart for two years,\" and John Hardying commented benevolently upon Umfraville's consequent winning of prisoners and booty."]}, {"page": "Jacob (surname)", "response": ["* E.
