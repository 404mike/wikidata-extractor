She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839 she undertook the role as governess for the Sidgwick family but left after a few months to return to Haworth where the sisters opened a school, but failed to attract pupils. Instead, they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Although her first novel, The Professor, was rejected by publishers, her second novel, Jane Eyre, was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles.\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855, almost certainly from hyperemesis gravidarum, a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anne Bront\u00eb", "response": ["Emily's death deeply affected Anne.

Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire. Mr. Brocklehurst is based on Rev. William Carus Wilson (1791\u20131859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school.

It was the residence of the Eyre family, and its first owner, Agnes Ashurst, was reputedly confined as a lunatic in a padded second floor room. It has been suggested that the Wycoller Hall in Lancashire, close to Haworth, provided the setting for Ferndean Manor to which Mr. Rochester retreats after the fire at Thornfield: there are similarities between the owner of Ferndean\u2014Mr. Rochester's father\u2014and Henry Cunliffe, who inherited Wycoller in the 1770s and lived there until his death in 1818; one of Cunliffe's relatives was named Elizabeth Eyre (n\u00e9e Cunliffe).

Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor. Her work is of interest to social historians as well as readers of literature. Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848. Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, published in 1857, was the first biography of Charlotte Bront\u00eb. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Bront\u00eb\u2019s life; the rest she left out, deciding that certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. Among Gaskell's best known novels are Cranford (1851\u201353), North and South (1854\u201355), and Wives and Daughters (1865), each having been adapted for television by the BBC.", "In 1850 the Gaskells moved to a villa at 84 Plymouth Grove.Uglow J.

This played a significant role in developing Gaskell's own literary career. In the biography, Gaskell chose to focus more on Bront\u00eb as a woman than as a writer of Romantic fiction.Stone, Donald D. The Romantic Impulse in Victorian Fiction. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, p. 141. In 1859 Gaskell travelled to Whitby to gather material for Sylvia's Lovers, which was published in 1863.

Thackeray's Pendennis was serialised at the same time as David Copperfield and it depicts its hero's personal and social journey from the countryside to the city. A rivalry existed between the two writers, though it preoccupied Thackeray more than Dickens. The most direct literary influence is \"obviously Carlyle\" who, in a lecture given in 1840, the year of his meeting with Dickens, on \"On Heroes, Hero-Worship\" and \"the Heroic in History\", claims that the most important modern character is \"the hero as a man of letters\".

Henry James remembered being moved to tears, while listening to the novel, hidden under a table, read aloud in the family circle. Dostoevsky enthusiastically cultivated the novel in a prison camp in Siberia. Franz Kafka wrote in his diary in 1917, that the first chapter of his novel Amerika was inspired by David Copperfield.Kafka's novel is a kind of inverted bildungsroman, since the young man whose destiny we follow is more of a disaster than an accomplishment. James Joyce parodied it in Ulysses. Virginia Woolf, who was not very fond of Dickens, states that David Copperfield, along with Robinson Crusoe, Grimm's fairy tales, Scott's Waverley and Pickwick's Posthumous Papers, \"are not books, but stories communicated by word of mouth in those tender years when fact and fiction merge, and thus belong to the memories and myths of life, and not to its esthetic experience.\" Woolf also noted in a letter to Hugh Walpole in 1936, that she is re-reading it for the sixth time: \"I'd forgotten how magnificent it is.\"Virginia Woolf, Letter to Hugh Walpole, 8 February 1936.
