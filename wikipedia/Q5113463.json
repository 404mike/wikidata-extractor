Not the least of his achievements on this occasion was the successful attempt, made with extraordinary tact, ability, knowledge and perseverance, to induce the Orientals, Anglicans and Old Catholics present to accept a formula of concord drawn from the writings of the leading theologians of the Greek Church on the long-vexed question of the procession of the Holy Spirit."]}, {"page": "Henry Edward Manning", "response": ["Manning spent his boyhood mainly at Coombe Bank, Sundridge, Kent, where he had for companions Charles Wordsworth and Christopher Wordsworth, later bishops of St Andrews and Lincoln respectively.

The principal gate was situated upon the narrow ridge already mentioned, and is still preserved; and adjoining it is the southern wall, about  in height. At the head of a narrow glen, which leads to the principal gate, stand the ruins of the temple of Nemesis upon a large artificial platform, supported by a wall of pure white marble. But we find upon this platform, which formed the temenos (\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) or sacred enclosure, the remains of two temples, which are almost contiguous, and nearly though not quite parallel to each other. The larger building was a peripteral hexastyle,  long and  broad, with 12 columns on the side, and with a pronaus, cella, and posticum in the usual manner. The smaller temple was  feet long by  feet broad, and consisted only of a cella, with a portico containing two Doric columns in antis. Among the ruins of the larger temple are some fragments of a colossal statue, corresponding in size with that of the Rhamnusian Nemesis; but these fragments were made of Attic marble, and not of Parian stone as stated by Pausanias. It is, however, not improbable, as William Martin Leake, who visited the site in the early 19th century, has remarked, that the story of the block of stone brought by the Persians was a fable, or an invention of the priests of Nemesis by which Pausanias was deceived. Among the ruins of the smaller temple was found a fragment, wanting the head and shoulders, of a statue of the human size in the archaic style of the Aeginetan school. This statue is now in the British Museum. Judging from this statue, as well as from the diminutive size and ruder architecture of the smaller temple, the latter appears to have been the more ancient of the two. Hence it has been inferred that the smaller temple was anterior to the Greco-Persian War, and was destroyed by the Persians just before the Battle of Marathon; and that the larger temple was erected in honour of the goddess, who had taken vengeance upon the insolence of the barbarians for outraging her worship. In front of the smaller temple are two chairs (\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) of white marble, upon one of which is the inscription \u039d\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03a3\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd, and upon the other (\u0398\u03ad\u03bc\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9 \u03a3\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd, which has led some to suppose that the smaller temple was dedicated to Themis. But it is more probable that both temples were dedicated to Nemesis, and that the smaller temple was in ruins before the larger was erected. A difficulty, however, arises about the time of the destruction of the smaller temple, from the fact that the forms of the letters and the long vowels in the inscriptions upon the chairs clearly show that those inscriptions belong to an era long subsequent to the battle of Marathon. Christopher Wordsworth considered it ridiculous to suppose that these chairs were dedicated in this temple after its destruction, and hence conjectures that the temple was destroyed towards the close of the Peloponnesian War by the Persian allies of Sparta.William Martin Leake, Demi of Attica, p. 105, et seq., 2nd ed.; Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 434, et seq.; Christopher Wordsworth, Athens and Attica, p. 34, et seq.; Unedited Antiquities of Attica, c. vi. p. 41, et seq."]}, {"page": "Hulsean Lectures", "response": ["* 1847 \u2014 Christopher Wordsworth, On the Canon of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and on the Apocrypha", "* 1848 \u2014 Christopher Wordsworth,  Lectures on the Apocalypse: critical, expository, and practicalMissing in Stephenson 1984, 291; cf.
