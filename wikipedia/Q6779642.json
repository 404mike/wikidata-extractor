The project became a lifetime work for Devey as the house was continually expanded during the remainder of the 19th century. The rambling and climbing shrubs he had planted as part of the design of the facades that Mary Gladstone described in her memoirs are no longer there."]}, {"page": "Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery", "response": ["There were times when Lady Rosebery's devotion to her husband was tested.

After a pause he exclaims 'Le jeu est fait, rien ne va plus!' after which no stake can be made. which must have been disconcerting for the child's Jewish mother.

On another occasion, when the Roseberys were travelling in India, Rosebery is reported to have announced \"I will travel ahead, Hannah and the rest of the heavy baggage will follow the next day.\"McKinstry, p. 76, attributes the remark to Sir George Leveson-Gower's account of a conversation between himself and Rosebery."]}, {"page": "Charles Masterman", "response": ["Masterman married Lucy Blanche Lyttelton, a politician, poet and writer, daughter of Rt.
