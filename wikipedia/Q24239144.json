By 1830, he was a conveyancer, and by 1835, he was a parliamentary draftsmen and counsel to the French claims commissioners. He married Frances Lydia Boyd, daughter of Walter Boyd and Harriet Anne n\u00e9e Goddard, in 1823, and they had one son and two daughters: Charles Edward Barry (born 1824); Frances Elizabeth (1826\u20131891); and Mary Georgiana (c.\u20091837\u20131898). They later separated after his wife was granted a separation in 1854.After unsuccessfully contesting the seat in 1826, Baldwin was first elected Tory MP for Totnes at the 1830 general election, but stood down at the 1832 election. During this period of his parliamentary career, he was listed by ministers as a 'friend', although he voted against the Reform Act 1832.He stood again for the seat at a by-election in 1839\u2013caused by the resignation of Jasper Parrott\u2013and secured the same number of votes as his only rival William Blount, resulting in a double return. However, after an election petition was submitted and reviewed, the election was declared void in April 1840, with a committee deciding that not enough notice of the poll had been given. In the resulting by-election, Baldwin was again elected, and then held the seat as a 'free trade Conservative' until 1852 when he was defeated.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|colspan=\"2\"|Charles Barry Baldwin", "|colspan=\"2\"|Charles Barry Baldwin"]}, {"page": "Charles Baldwin", "response": ["*Charles Barry Baldwin (1789\u20131859), British politician"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|Charles Barry Baldwin", "|rowspan=2|Charles Barry Baldwin", "|Charles Barry Baldwin"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Totnes(two members)||Charles Barry Baldwin||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Totnes(two members)||Charles Barry Baldwin||"]}]}}
