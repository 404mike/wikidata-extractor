Sharon Marie Carnicke, a professor of critical studies and acting at the USC School of Dramatic Arts, mentioned that \"Kidman's [acting] choices are believable and natural as reactions to the specific circumstances in her world\" and described her work as \"kinetic\". Dennis Bingham, a professor of English and director of film studies at Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Indianapolis, stated that \"Kidman acts always a step or two outside the character, telegraphing her reactions, elongating the time she takes to articulate her decisions and conclusions. Even her emotional responses are presented as signs.\" Pam Cook, a professor of film at the University of Southampton, suggests in her biography of Kidman that \"her emphasis on artifice and technique points to a conception of screen acting that looks to cinematic expression rather than to the actor's body and intentions for the realisation of character.\" Mary Luckhurst, a professor and head of the University of Bristol School of Arts with credentials in theatre and performance, stated how \"she has strategically pursued a high-risk mutability and versatility, and regularly traverses between naturalist and non-naturalist roles and artforms.\" She continues saying that \"she can continually test her own emotional limits, physical skills, politics, values and frames of reference\" and mentions how \"her conception of character acting involves metamorphosing gradually into something that she feels is so 'other' that she frequently speaks of losing herself or getting lost in the role, and her preparedness to challenge herself in this respect has continually surprised other actors, directors and producers.\""]}, {"page": "Charles Wood (playwright)", "response": ["On leaving the Army, Wood worked as an electronic wireman at BAC, Filton near Bristol.
