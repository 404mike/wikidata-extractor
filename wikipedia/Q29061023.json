The series, starring Paul McGann, dramatises the WWI Etaples Mutiny of 1917. In 1987, Charlottetown Festival director Walter Learning presented the Canadian premiere of the Bleasdale musical Are You Lonesome Tonight? at the Confederation Centre of the Arts, a national arts centre located on Prince Edward Island. The musical, which took a tough look at the life of Elvis Presley, attracted controversy at a festival for its coarse language and adult subject matter. Regardless of the objections, brought up in the provincial legislature, the play was a success for the festival. Bleasdale penned the political drama G.B.H. (Great British Holiday) for Channel 4 in 1991. Focussing on the political upheaval of the Labour Party in Liverpool, G.B.H. pits mild-mannered protagonist Jim Nelson against the northern City Council leader Michael Murray."]}, {"page": "The Monocled Mutineer", "response": ["The Monocled Mutineer is a 1986 BBC television drama series starring Paul McGann about the \u00c9taples mutiny in 1917 during the First World War.

However, Bleasdale had at the time turned it down saying, \"I don't do adaptations.\" He eventually changed his mind, finding some personal resonances in the story.

He claimed that the serial was \"riddled with error\" and The Daily Telegraph reported that \"He accused the producer of ignoring his advice ... Mr Putkowski disclaimed all responsibility for what he says are factual errors and misinterpretations in the series. He accused the BBC of failing to consult him on the final version of the script and described the book by William Allison and John Fairley, on which the series is based, as 'a sensational version of the mutiny and Toplis' life.'\""]}, {"page": "Arthur C.
