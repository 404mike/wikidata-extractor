Port Vale secured promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313. He signed with Grimsby Town in July 2013, before briefly joining Tranmere Rovers a year later. He signed with Southport in September 2014, and moved to Redditch United in February 2015 and then Worcester City in June 2015.

He signed the contract within days, saying it was time to \"finish the job I started\". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals \u2013 both scoring and conceding \u2013 Adams decided to give his players \"a kick up the backside\" by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Rob Kozluk. He stepped down as a director on 5 November, the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale, after former director Stan Meigh withdrew the \u00a350,000 sponsorship he had provided to keep Adams on the board of directors."]}, {"page": "Macdonald", "response": ["* Clayton McDonald (born 1988), English footballer"]}, {"page": "John McCombe", "response": ["Adams continued to use McCombe in the heart of the Vale defence at the start of 2011\u201312, however he dropped him from the first team after 11 matches in favour of loan signing Liam Chilvers. He marked his return to the first team on 14 October 2011 with the second goal of a 3\u20130 win over Northampton Town. However, he was dropped after the next match, a 4\u20130 defeat at home to Morecambe, only to win back his first-team place the following month after turning down the chance to leave the club on loan. With the loanees back at their parent clubs, Gareth Owen out injured and Clayton McDonald in court, McCombe helped to guide teenage centre back Joe Davis through the final stages of the season. He agreed to sign a new two-year deal with the club in June 2012.", "He formed a solid centre-back partnership with Clayton McDonald at the start of 2012\u201313.  On 25 August, he scored in a 3\u20131 win over Morecambe at the Globe Arena, earning himself a place on the League Two team of the week. On 27 October, he was sent off for the second time in his career, again against Northampton at Sixfields, as he put in a late challenge on midfielder Alex Nicholls, who managed to score the opening goal of the match just before McCombe made his challenge; it was later confirmed that the tackle had broken Nicholls's leg. Opposition manager Aidy Boothroyd accepted McCombe's apology, and Northampton player Akinfenwa also stated that McCombe was \"not a malicious character\". McCombe himself picked up an injury on 1 January 2013, damaging knee ligaments in a defeat to Fleetwood Town, and was ruled out of action for several weeks. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish at the end of the season, with McCombe playing 37 matches in a regularly changing four back.

He then signed goalkeeper D\u00e1vid Gr\u00f3f; defenders Mat Sadler and Lee Beevers; midfielders Kevan Hurst, Claude Gnakpa, Adam Chambers, and Anton Peterlin; and striker Ryan Jarvis. Also during the campaign he boosted his squad with loan signings Dave Martin, Mark Wilson, Andy Halliday, and Florent Cuvelier. His side lost just one of their first five league games, but then picked up just three points from their next seven games. They beat Preston North End on 15 October, but then picked up just four points from their next eight games. From 26 November, they were beaten just once in nine matches, but became the division's draw specialists as seven of these nine games finished level.

Evans was convicted on 20 April 2012 and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. He was eligible for release on licence after serving half of that sentence. During his imprisonment Evans worked as a painter and decorator in prison. In August 2012, Evans was refused leave to appeal against the conviction by a Court of Appeal of England and Wales judge and the full court upheld the decision in November.  Evans continued to maintain his innocence and in November 2013 recruited a new legal team to attempt to clear his name.", "On 8 January 2015, it was announced by Grimsby Town director John Fenty that a financial backer had offered the club to pay his full wages in order to bring Evans to the Conference Premier club. Having held a board meeting along with team manager Paul Hurst it was decided that the move would be of too high risk for the club. Grimsby had previously employed Clayton McDonald, the fellow footballer and friend of Evans who was acquitted in the same case, during the 2013\u201314 season."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["| Clayton McDonald", "| Clayton McDonald", "|  Clayton McDonald", "|  Clayton McDonald"]}]}}
