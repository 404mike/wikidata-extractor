Hamsters as a New Pet. T.F.H. Publications Inc., NJ . The entire laboratory and pet populations of Syrian hamsters appear to be descendants of a single brother\u2013sister pairing. These littermates were captured and imported in 1930 from Aleppo in Syria by Israel Aharoni, a zoologist of the University of Jerusalem.Fritzsche, Peter. 2008. Hamsters: A Complete Pet Owner\u2019s Manual. Barron\u2019s Educational Series Inc., NY . In Jerusalem, the hamsters bred very successfully. Years later, animals of this original breeding colony were exported to the United States, where Syrian hamsters became a common pet and laboratory animal. Comparative studies of domestic and wild Syrian hamsters have shown reduced genetic variability in the domestic strain. However, the differences in behavioral, chronobiological, morphometrical, hematological, and biochemical parameters are relatively small and fall into the expected range of interstrain variations in other laboratory animals.Kuhnen, G.

Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London. In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat.Moyal, pp. 94\u201396. English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered just a few years before.Moyal, pp. 46\u201348.

Together with a Syrian guide named Georgius Khalil Tah'an, Aharoni managed to discover a nest containing a female and eleven young in the Aleppo region. However, cannibalism of one of the litter by the mother, and the subsequent death of the mother, meant that Aharoni had to hand-rear the pups during the journey back.

Waterhouse was influenced by Owen and in a paper attacked such heresies, setting his species in the symbolic circles of the Quinarian system, not hereditary trees. Darwin sent a sharp response about these \"vicious circles\".", "Darwin's researches led to a meeting on 23 November with Charles James Fox Bunbury, in which he discussed the geographical distribution of plants and animals, particularly in the Galapagos islands where they strikingly showed \"a South American character as it were stamped on them all, while nearly all the species are peculiar.\" As Bunbury recalled, \"He avowed himself to some extent a believer in the transmutation of species, though not, he said, exactly according to the doctrine either of Lamarck or of the Vestiges.
