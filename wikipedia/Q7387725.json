Davies", "itemDescription": "British politician (1886-1972)", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._O._Davies", "wikipedia_page": {"main": "Stephen Owen Davies (c.\u20091886 \u2013 25 February 1972) was a Welsh miner, trade union official and Labour Party politician, who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Merthyr Tydfil from 1950 to 1972, and previously Merthyr from 1934 to 1950. In 1970, when well past 80, he was deselected as parliamentary candidate by his local party association on account of his age. He fought the constituency in the 1970 general election as an Independent and won comfortably, a rare example in British politics of an independent candidate defeating a major party's organisation. In a BBC TV interview the day after that election, he claimed to be 83 years old.\nMost official records show Davies's birth date as November 1886, but he is widely thought to have been born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied mining engineering and later took an Arts degree at University College, Cardiff. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918, he was elected miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, legal adviser, and vice-president. After a visit to Moscow in 1922, he became a firm advocate of the Soviet Union, a position he maintained for the rest of his life.\nAfter his election to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent advocate for the interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official Labour policy by championing such causes as disarmament and Welsh nationalism. His persistence in doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. An immensely popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities. In 1966, after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan with the loss of 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, for fear that an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972, aged at least 85, and possibly over 90.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1879", "response": ["* November 9 \u2013 S. O.

Davies, gave evidence to the tribunal and stated that he had long held concerns that the tip \"might not only slide, but in sliding might reach the village\"; he added that he had not spoken out because he had \"more than a shrewd suspicion that that colliery would be closed\". Brian Gibbens, QC, the counsel for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), challenged Davies's evidence and stated that if the testament \"is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection\u00a0... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster\". Gibbens requested that Davies's testimony be rejected, on the basis that he \"never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words\". The tribunal agreed, and stated that \"we doubt that he fully understood the grave implication of what he was saying\".", "The tribunal report quoted one expert who said that Tip 5 \"has been standing and is standing at a very low factor of safety\"; the quote was read out by Thatcher in the October 1967 parliamentary debate on the inquiry report.

The final cost of the removal was \u00a3850,000. The trustees of the fund voted to accept the request for payment after realising that there was no alternative if they wanted the tips removed. S. O. Davies, the only member of the committee to vote against the payment, resigned in protest. There was a reminder of the danger for the residents of Aberfan when, in August 1968, heavy rain caused slurry to be washed down the village's streets. At the time, the Charity Commission made no objection to this action; the political scientists Jacint Jordana and David Levi-Faur consider the payment \"unquestionably unlawful\" under charity law."]}, {"page": "Davies", "response": ["* S.
