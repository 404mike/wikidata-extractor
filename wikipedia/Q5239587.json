Contact was made with a group of Kwakwaka'wakw off the north coast of Vancouver Continuing east and south around Vancouver Island Strange noted the more constricted waters of Queen Charlotte Strait.

Strange himself thought he had found the entrance to the fabled strait, but fur trading took priority and he did investigate.
