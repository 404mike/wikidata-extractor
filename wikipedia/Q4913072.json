He later joined Sheffield United, playing in their first season in existence before retiring in 1890.

The meeting of both clubs in the FA Cup meant that the match was postponed until February, by which point the Olive Grove was snow covered and the match was switched to Bramall Lane. Arthur volunteered for the 'Sheffield Wednesday and District' team but despite both clubs being locked into a draw in the first half Preston ran away with the match, winning 8\u20131. It was reported that Wednesday's heavy loss was \"in great measure owing to the wretched performance of Wharton, who utterly failed to uphold his high reputation as a goalkeeper\" and that he \"could not have stopped the ball had it been half as big as a balloon\". It was reported that at times the Wednesday fans applauded every kick Arthur took and one fan angrily asked the Preston team where they had \"brought him from\" as it was well known that Arthur was a former Preston player. There were even fears that Arthur would be the victim of violence as he left the field. Arthur did have a connection to Sheffield Wednesday, through his trainer in Sheffield 'Billy' South, who amongst other noted Sheffield sporting icons of the day also trained Wednesday's Tommy Crawshaw."]}, {"page": "Alfred Lyttelton", "response": ["Lyttelton played in the last days of the \"dribbling game\", the earliest form of the Association code and a style of play that valued individualism and close ball control over passing and teamwork. In his solitary international his England teammates were highly critical of his attempts to dribble through the entire Scotland defence by himself, and Billy Mosforth, the Sheffield player, ventured to draw his colleague's attention to this failing. He was silenced by an imperious put-down that has been cited as exemplifying the attitude of the earliest amateurs: \"I play,\" the unabashed Lyttelton said back, \"for my own pleasure.\""]}, {"page": "1878\u201379 in English football", "response": ["|Billy Mosforth (The Wednesday) (5 mins), Charles Bambridge (Swifts) (48 & 83 mins), Arthur Goodyer (Nottingham Forest) (60 mins) & Norman Bailey (Clapham Rovers) (75 mins)"]}, {"page": "1879\u201380 in English football", "response": ["|Billy Mosforth (The Wednesday) (8 mins), Charles Bambridge (Swifts) (42 & 87 mins) & Francis Sparks (Clapham Rovers) (89 mins)"]}, {"page": "1881\u201382 in English football", "response": ["|Billy Mosforth (The Wednesday) (30 mins), Edward Hagarty Parry (Old Carthusians) (35 mins) & Henry Cursham (Notts County) (48 mins)"]}, {"page": "1850s in association football", "response": ["* 2 January \u2013 Billy Mosforth (d. 1929), England international in nine matches from 1877 to 1882."]}, {"page": "William Mosforth", "response": ["#redirect Billy Mosforth"]}, {"page": "Henry Wace (footballer)", "response": ["For the annual match against Scotland played at the Oval on 5 April 1879, Wace retained his place and was appointed captain.
