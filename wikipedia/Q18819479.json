The Cavalry Division was disbanded (November 1900) and French, with Haig still his chief of staff, was put in charge of an all-arms force policing the Johannesburg area, later trying to capture the Boer leader de Wet around Bloemfontein. In January 1901 Haig was given a column of 2,500 men with the local rank of brigadier-general, patrolling Cape Colony, and chasing Commandant Kritzinger. As was standard policy at that time, Haig's actions included burning farmsteads as part of the scorched earth policies ordered by Lord Kitchener as well as rounding up Boer women and children to be placed in concentration camps.Groot 1988, p. 87. Throughout the war Haig's sister Henrietta had been lobbying Evelyn Wood for her brother to have command of a cavalry regiment of his own when the war was over. French, probably not wanting to part with a valuable assistant, recommended Herbert Lawrence for the vacant command of the 17th Lancers, but Roberts, now Commander-in-Chief back in Britain, overruled him and gave it to Haig (May 1901). As the 17th Lancers were in South Africa at the time Haig was able to combine that command with that of his own column.Groot 1988, p. 91.", "The purge of Haig's staff continued, with the removal of Maxwell (Quartermaster-General) and Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell as BEF Chief of Staff. It is possible that Derby was covering Haig's back, advising him to ask for Herbert Lawrence as the new CGS, not General Butler. Lawrence was a much stronger character than Kiggell and having made money in business and having no plans to stay in the Army after the War, was not beholden to Haig. In time the two men made a good team.Sheffield 2011, p. 258. If Derby had covered Haig's back, Haig was not grateful, likening Derby to \"a feather pillow which bears the mark of the last person who sat on him\".Groot 1988, pp. 359\u2013360.", "Haig did not speak to or visit Gough until 23 March. That day Haig arranged for reserves to be sent down from Flanders. Formal orders were issued to Fifth Army to maintain contact with Third Army to their north and the French to their south.Sheffield 2011, pp. 270\u2013271. After initial optimism, Tim Travers has written of \"panic\" setting in amongst senior officers like Herbert Lawrence and Tavish Davidson at GHQ on 23 March,Sheffield 2011, p. 275. and there is evidence that a retreat towards the Channel Ports may have been considered.Travers 1992, pp. 54, 66\u201370.", "This is one of the occasions where doubt has been cast on the authenticity of Haig's diary. Haig's handwritten diary of the next meeting (Dury, 24 March at 11\u00a0pm) is brief. The typed diary \u2013 probably based on notes prepared in April \u2013 describes Petain as \"almost unbalanced and most anxious\", claiming that after attending a Cabinet meeting in Paris, where he had been ordered to \"cover Paris at all costs\",Sheffield 2011, p. 273. he threatened to retreat on Paris, leaving the British right flank uncovered. Tim Travers argues that Petain said at the meeting that he would only retreat on Paris if Haig retreated on the Channel Ports, and that Major-General Clive reported from the meeting that Petain had come away satisfied that Haig would not break contact. In a postwar exchange of letters with Haig Petain denied that he had ordered a retreat on Paris or had threatened Haig that he might, a recollection which Herbert Lawrence appears to have supported.Travers 1992, pp. 66\u201368. It has been suggested that Haig and Lawrence, on the long drive back to GHQ from their meeting with Petain may simply have misunderstood his intentions, and that any factual errors in Haig's diary for this period were honest if mistaken recollections.", "With another German attack imminent, Herbert Lawrence was asked (12\u201313 July \u2013 Haig was on leave in England) to send 8 Divisions \u2013 he sent only 2 (XXII Corps). Haig thought this was breaching an agreement of 1 July that covering Paris and the Somme area was to take priority. Wilson consulted the War Cabinet then (in the small hours of 15 July) told Haig to \"exercise his judgement\" about holding the British line. Haig felt that they would take credit for Foch's victory but might dismiss him if disaster befell the British forces. The German \"Peace Offensive\" began against the French at Rheims on the same day. Haig eventually agreed that the French could use XXII Corps if necessary \"for exploitation\".Sheffield 2011, pp. 291\u2013292."]}, {"page": "British Expeditionary Force (World War I)", "response": ["The force was commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French until December 1915,Pearce & Stewart (2002), pp.289\u2013290 when he was replaced by General Sir Douglas Haig.Griffiths & Greiss (2003), p.69 The BEF's Chief of Staff on mobilisation was General Archibald Murray.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography J.

Herbert Lawrence, who became the B.E.F.'s Chief of Intelligence briefly in early 1918, testified to the efficiency of the organisation he inherited from Charteris when he replaced him after his dismissal. Bourne argues that although Charteris was wrong about the wider issues of German morale and manpower, he was effective at predicting enemy troop deployments, immediate plans and tactical changes. In Bourne's view, he was not Haig's \"evil genius\", but rather shared Haig's innate optimism and did nothing to undermine it."]}, {"page": "66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division", "response": ["For two years, the 2nd East Lancashire Division (numbered the 66th Division in August 1915), provided trained replacements for its parent unit and carried out home defence duties in England.

In early 1915, the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers, a second-line battalion, was detached for overseas service and joined the 51st (Highland) Division. The battalion was replaced by another duplicate battalion, the 3/5th Lancashire Fusiliers, which became one of the few third-line territorial battalions to see active service. One of the three companies of Royal Engineers, was sent to France in 1915 to join the 48th (South Midland) Division and during 1916, three of the four heavy and howitzer artillery batteries were withdrawn or broken up. Following the Military Service Act of January 1916, all Territorial soldiers were deemed to liable for overseas service and in February 1917, the 66th Division was instructed to prepare for a move to continental Europe and received a new and experienced commander, Major-General Herbert Lawrence.", "|Major-General the Honorable Herbert Lawrence"]}, {"page": "General Officers of World War I", "response": ["A list of potential subjects was compiled by Evan Charteris and Lewis Vernon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt and approved by Bailey.
