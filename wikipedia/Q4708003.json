A fast-medium bowler and aggressive lower-order batsman, Watt made 230 appearances in first-class cricket; in the most part for Kent County Cricket Club.\nBorn in Limpsfield Chart, Watt's first-class career began while Kent's star spin bowler Tich Freeman was at the height of his powers. Watt was therefore used primarily to take the shine off the ball in preparation for Freeman's imminent bowling spell. After the retirement of Freeman, Watt struck up an effective opening bowling partnership with all-rounder Leslie Todd, and took 108 wickets in the 1937 season. A tireless bowler, Watt could achieve late swing, which accounted for many of his victims.As a batsman, Watt was renowned as an aggressive player, forming a trio with Middlesex's Jim Smith and Somerset's Arthur Wellard well known for hitting sixes. Watt and Wellard would both play for the London Counties cricket team during the Second World War, entertaining crowds during the 1941 season. Technically Watt excelled with the drive and the pull.Later in life he kept the Star Inn in Matfield, before he died in Pembury Hospital in 1974.", "link_mentions": {}}}
