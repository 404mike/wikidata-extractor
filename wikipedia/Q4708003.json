A fast-medium bowler and aggressive lower-order batsman, Watt made 230 appearances in first-class cricket; in the most part for Kent County Cricket Club.\nBorn in Limpsfield Chart, Watt's first-class career began while Kent's star spin bowler Tich Freeman was at the height of his powers. Watt was therefore used primarily to take the shine off the ball in preparation for Freeman's imminent bowling spell. After the retirement of Freeman, Watt struck up an effective opening bowling partnership with all-rounder Leslie Todd, and took 108 wickets in the 1937 season. A tireless bowler, Watt could achieve late swing, which accounted for many of his victims.As a batsman, Watt was renowned as an aggressive player, forming a trio with Middlesex's Jim Smith and Somerset's Arthur Wellard well known for hitting sixes. Watt and Wellard would both play for the London Counties cricket team during the Second World War, entertaining crowds during the 1941 season. Technically Watt excelled with the drive and the pull.Later in life he kept the Star Inn in Matfield, before he died in Pembury Hospital in 1974.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matfield", "response": ["*Alan Watt (1907\u201374), cricketer, lived in Matfield"]}, {"page": "Gerry Chalk", "response": ["Chalk made 1,000 runs both seasons he was captain of Kent and was described as \"skilful\" in defence, with the ability to score effectively and field well. He scored five centuries for Kent, with his highest score of 198 being made at Tonbridge against Sussex in 1939. He was considered an \"excellent captain in the field\" who was effective at managing his bowling attack and who was aggressive in pursuing victories. In 1939 he promoted fast scoring bowler Alan Watt to bat alongside Arthur Fagg in Kent's second innings at Colchester. Fagg scored a double century in both innings of the match, the only time this has been achieved in first-class cricket.Mukherjee A (2016) Arthur Fagg scores double-hundred in each innings, Cricket Country, 2016-07-15.

He scored a century in the penultimate match of Kent's 1939 season in August against Yorkshire at Dover, carrying his bat through Kent's first innings against Hedley Verity's bowling, and played his final first-class match against Lancashire later the same month.Gill M (2005) Growing into War, pp.62\u201363.

Having reverted to his more natural medium-paced bowling style, which offered pronounced in-swing, Todd took over 80 wickets in each of the next five seasons. 1936 saw Todd perform the double; scoring 1,320 runs and taking 103 wickets, while his 1,323 runs and 91 wickets in 1937 saw him invited to play in the end-of-season Test trial match.Carlaw, p. 54."]}, {"page": "List of people from Pembury", "response": ["*Alan Watt (1907\u201374), cricketer, died in Pembury Hospital"]}, {"page": "Alan Watt", "response": ["Alan Watt may refer to:", "* Alan Watt (diplomat) (1901\u20131988), Australian diplomat", "* Alan Watt (cricketer) (1907\u20131974), English cricketer", "* Alan Watt (author) (born 1965), Canadian author and comedian", "* Alan Watt (rugby union) (born 1967), Scotland rugby union player", "* Alan Watts (1915\u20131973), British philosopher"]}]}}
