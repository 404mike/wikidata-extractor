Vine spent his formative years in Libya and Hong Kong. He studied composition at the Royal Northern College of Music with Anthony Gilbert (b. 1934, UK) and privately with Simon Holt (b. 1958, UK).\nOne can detect traces of Near and Far Eastern modalities as well as gestural and formal elements in his music.  SIRI (1997), a frequently performed tour-de-force for solo percussion with electronics, uses a rhythmic and structural language found in the highly ritualised percussion music of Japan and Korea.\nAlthough much of his work tends toward longer time frames, some of his pieces are very short.  Conversely, the pieces sound as if they are longer.  writing on water (1999-), commissioned by Matthew Herbert and released on the Accidental label, is an expanding collection of short (sometimes only 20 seconds long) works using recorded acoustic instruments;  and shadow grounds (1999), commissioned by the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival for the ensemble recherche as part of their In Nomine Broken Consort Book, a three-minute non-miniature of suspended sound.\nHis three black moons (1999), commissioned by the London Sinfonietta, was described by The Guardian, '...the most striking piece takes its title from an Alexander Calder mobile - its magical floating sonorities had a Feldmanesque beauty.'  Ian Vine is described as 'one of the most striking new voices to have come to light' (The Guardian), his music is performed across Europe and has been broadcast worldwide.\nIan Vine is the artistic director of new music ensemble Radius.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Ian Vine || 1974 ||  || British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "London Sinfonietta", "response": ["The Sinfonietta's acclaimed discography includes seminal recordings of many 20th-century classics, including the premiere recording of Hans Werner Henze's song cycle Voices under the baton of the composer.

The ensemble specialises in the performance of new music from around the world (though primarily in the Western classical music tradition) written by living composers and 20th-century masters.

Modelled on the 1960s ensemble The Fires of London, (which in turn was derived from the instrumentation of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire), the core instrumental line-up of Radius is flute, clarinet, violin, cello, piano, and percussion. To this instrumentation have been added trumpet, trombone, French horn, actors, and vocalists, as required for the performance of specific works.", "*Ian Vine: underpaintings (2005), Wigmore Hall, London, 20 April 2007", "*Ian Vine: X (2007), Wigmore Hall, London, 8 January 2008", "*Ian Vine: fifty objects (2007), Wigmore Hall, London, 8 January 2008 \u2020", "*Ian Vine: Gesso (2008), Southbank Centre, London, 25 May 2008"]}]}}
