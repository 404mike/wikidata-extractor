Their conclusion was that despite a fair amount of the latter, \"Chamberlain stands ... as an intellectual giant and a major intellectual force, whose legacy will endure.\"  Chamberlain's definition of bargaining power is still taught and used, such as in its presentation in the 2012 textbook Fundamentals of Labor Economics by Thomas Hyclak, Geraint Johnes, and Robert Thornton and in the 2004 fifth edition of the popular International City/County Management Association \"Green Book\" Management Policies in Local Government Finance."]}, {"page": "Hyclak, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Hyclak"]}]}}
