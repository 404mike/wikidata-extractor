When Red Dwarf encounters a holoship with an all-hologram crew composed of the \"best and brightest\" in the episode \"Holoship\" (1991), Rimmer desperately wants to join. A female officer aboard the ship, Nirvanah Crane, played by Jane Horrocks, falls in love with him and sacrifices her place on the ship for Rimmer, only for Rimmer to do the same in return for her. This act of nobility surprises even Rimmer himself. In \"Out of Time\" (1993), Rimmer is disgusted by his corrupt future self to the point where he'd rather do battle with him than surrender (\"Better dead than smeg!\"), Rimmer later frantically risking his life to save the others after their future selves kill them. In \"The Beginning\" (2012), Rimmer is also able to formulate a plan to save the crew from the Simulant Generals. Rimmer has also showed the capacity to respect other viewpoints in conflict with his own; in \"The Last Day\" (1989), he tries to convince Lister that he should respect Kryten's right to believe in Silicon Heaven in spite of it conflicting with Lister's own beliefs, \"Lemons\" (2012) sees Rimmer eager to meet Jesus despite being an atheist, and in \"Samsara\" he presents a well-reasoned argument about the flaws in the concept of the Karma Drive. In \"Polymorph\" (1989), Rimmer leads Kryten and Cat in the hunt for the intruder and in \"Bodyswap\" (1989), he takes charge of the hunt for Red Dwarf's self-destruct mechanism. Once Rimmer is sapped of his anger by the Polymorph, he is a conciliatory pacifist wishing to promote peace between the creature and various members of the crew and keen to not hurt anybody's feelings during their discussions. In \"Backwards\" (1989), he revels in his success as a showbiz performer and extols the virtues of a world without war, famine, crime or death. In \"Tikka to Ride\" (1997), Rimmer protests against abusing the Time Drive and chastises Lister for doing so."]}, {"page": "List of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy characters", "response": ["In  to  and  Fenchurch is played by actress Jane Horrocks."]}, {"page": "Jim Broadbent", "response": ["In 2015, Broadbent along with Daniel Rigby, Antonia Thomas, Fearne Cotton and Jane Horrocks are revealed to be the new cast with Broadbent as a Voice Trumpet in the reboot of classic British children's television series Teletubbies.
