After being promoted to Division 2 in 2011, they have remained there ever since, achieving their best finish of 3rd in 2012, 2014 and 2017, helped by standout performances from players such as Rosalie Birch, Jodie Dibble and Caitlin O'Keefe.

Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their target with seven balls to spare.
