His managerial career began at Middlesbrough in the Premier League. During his tenure, Middlesbrough won their first (and thus far only) major trophy, the League Cup in 2004. They were also UEFA Cup runners-up in 2006. He was appointed manager of the England national team in August 2006, but was dismissed a year later after England failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008, and was the subject of strong media criticism.In 2008, McClaren was appointed manager of Dutch club Twente, with whom he won the club's first ever Eredivisie championship in 2010. Soon afterwards he took over at VfL Wolfsburg in Germany, though he was dismissed mid-season due to poor results. After a short spell as manager of Nottingham Forest, he returned to Twente in 2012. His second stint with Twente was less successful, however, and McClaren resigned in early 2013. He returned to Derby later that year, leading the club to the play-offs in the 2013\u201314 season, but failed to win promotion and he was dismissed in 2015. He was soon appointed as head coach of Newcastle United, but was dismissed after less than year after winning only six of his 28 Premier League matches in charge.
