Charles Bury, 1st Earl of Charleville, was Dunalley's half-brother. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Carlow Borough in 1798, a seat he held until the Irish Parliament was abolished in 1801. The same year he succeeded his father as second Baron Dunalley, but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the British House of Lords. In 1819 Dunalley became a Member of Parliament (MP) in the British House of Commons for Okehampton, and represented this constituency until 1824. He was elected an Irish Representative Peer in 1828, and sat in the House of Lords until his death.\nLord Dunalley married, firstly, Maria Trant, daughter of Dominick Trant, in 1802. After his first wife's death in 1819 he married, secondly, Hon. Emily Maude, daughter of Cornwallis Maude, 1st Viscount Hawarden, in 1826. Lord Dunalley died in October 1854, aged 79. Both his marriages were childless and he was succeeded in the barony by his nephew Henry Prittie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1775", "response": ["* March 3 \u2013 Henry Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley, British politician (d. 1854)"]}, {"page": "List of Irish representative peers", "response": ["|Henry Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley||19 December 1828||John Creighton, 1st Earl Erne||19 October 1854", "|Edward Ward, 4th Viscount Bangor||9 January 1855||Henry Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley||14 September 1881"]}, {"page": "Henry Sadlier Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley"]}, {"page": "1854 in Ireland", "response": ["*19 October \u2013 Henry Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley, politician (born 1775)."]}, {"page": "1775 in Ireland", "response": ["*3 March \u2013 Henry Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley, politician (died 1854)."]}, {"page": "Dunalley", "response": ["*Henry Prittie, 2nd Baron Dunalley (1775\u20131854), Anglo-Irish politician"]}, {"page": "Charles Bury, 1st Earl of Charleville", "response": ["Bury was the son of John Bury, son of William Bury and the Honourable Jane Moore, daughter of John Moore, 1st Baron Moore and sister of Charles Moore, 1st Earl of Charleville.
