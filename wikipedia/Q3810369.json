Artificial grass laid upon blocks of polystyrene foam that formed the shape of the landscape. For the chocolate river, McDowell insisted on having the river look edible, saying \"in the first film, it's so distasteful.\" According to Tim Burton, \"the important thing for me was that we wanted to give the chocolate river a really chocolatey feel, give it a weight, not just brown water. That's why we tried to use a real chocolate substitute, to give it a movement and texture.\" Joss Williams oversaw the creation of a faux chocolate concoction, taking months to create a non-toxic edible substance with the right consistency. The final mixture, developed by a UK-based chemical company called Vickers, was a mix of water, food grade biocide, and hydroxyethyl cellulose. 192,000 gallons of faux chocolate filled the river, while 30,000 gallons of the same material made up the chocolate waterfall. Wonka's boat, used by the characters to travel down the chocolate river, took 20 weeks to build and incorporated 54 animatronic Oompa-Loompas, along with its own internal rowing mechanism.", "| Nick Davis, Jon Thum, Chas Jarrett, and Joss Williams"]}, {"page": "The Bourne Ultimatum (film)", "response": ["| Peter Chiang, Charlie Noble, Mattias Lindahl, and Joss Williams"]}, {"page": "59th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Charlie and the Chocolate Factory \u2013 Nick Davis, Jon Thum, Chas Jarrett and Joss Williams"]}, {"page": "53rd British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Sleepy Hollow \u2013 Jimmy Mitchell, Kevin Yagher, Joss Williams and Paddy Eason"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects", "response": ["| Sleepy Hollow || Jim Mitchell, Kevin Yagher, Joss Williams, and Paddy Eason", "| Charlie and the Chocolate Factory || Nick Davis, Jon Thum, Chas Jarrett, and Joss Williams", "| The Bourne Ultimatum || Peter Chiang, Charlie Noble, Mattias Lindahl, and Joss Williams", "| Hugo || Robert Legato, Ben Grossmann, and Joss Williams"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Williams", "response": ["*Joss Williams, special effects supervisor"]}, {"page": "84th Academy Awards", "response": ["* Hugo\u00a0\u2013 Rob Legato, Joss Williams, Ben Grossmann, and Alex Henning"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["|Joss Williams"]}]}}
