Carl Emberson saved Owen Archdeacon's penalty kick, before David Greene gave his side a 3\u20131 advantage. Dean Walling then scored for Carlisle as Colchester substitute Karl Duguid stepped up to take his penalty. His effort was tipped onto the post by Caig and saved, a moment which saw a young Duguid break down into tears. Warren Aspinall levelled the score at 3\u20133 with the next kick for Carlisle. Peter Cawley took Colchester's next penalty, which was again saved by Caig.
