He \"made a number of original and insightful innovations\" in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs (specifically the Rosetta Stone) before Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion eventually expanded on his work.\nYoung has been described as \"The Last Man Who Knew Everything\". His work influenced that of William Herschel, Hermann von Helmholtz, James Clerk Maxwell, and Albert Einstein. Young is credited with establishing the wave theory of light, in contrast to the particle theory of Isaac Newton. Young's work was subsequently supported by the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel.", "link_mentions": {}}}
