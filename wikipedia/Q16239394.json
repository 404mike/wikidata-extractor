Aged 16 when he joined the band, Dalglish occasionally played a two-piece drum kit, which he did whilst standing up; this style would later be carried on in Gillespie's playing. His drumming can be heard on the band's first single \"Upside Down\", along with its B-side, the Syd Barrett cover \"Vegetable Man\". He left to become an apprentice coach builder, but has kept his hand in drumming in several bands over the years. Currently playing in 2Sevens.Dalglish was drummer for Baby's Got a Gun, Trixie's Big Red Motorbike, The Sux Pastels and The Decay, 2Sevens and as of 2014, he owns a hair salon in East Kilbride.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Jesus and Mary Chain", "response": ["The brothers started recording and sending demos to record companies in 1983 (using a Portastudio bought with \u00a3300 given to them by their father from redundancy pay after he lost his factory job), and by early 1984 they had recruited bass player Douglas Hart and teenage drummer Murray Dalglish. Early influences included The Velvet Underground, The Stooges, and The Shangri-Las, William stating in 1985, \"We all love The Shangri-Las, and one day we're going to make Shangri-Las records.\" Jim mentioned his liking for Pink Floyd, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Monkees and Muddy Waters. Early demos displayed a similarity to the Ramones, prompting the brothers to add another element to their sound; in William's words: \"That's why we started using noise and feedback. We want to make records that sound different.\" They began playing live in Spring 1984. In the early days William Reid's guitar would be left out of tune, while Dalglish's drum kit was limited to two drums, and Hart's bass guitar only had three strings, down to two by 1985; in Hart's words, \"That's the two I use. I mean, what's the fucking point spending money on another two? Two is enough.\"Sky News interview, 1985", "* Murray Dalglish\u00a0\u2013 drums (1984)", "  bar:Murray text:Murray Dalglish"]}, {"page": "Dalglish", "response": ["* Murray Dalglish (born 1968), Scottish musician"]}, {"page": "The Power of Negative Thinking: B-Sides & Rarities", "response": ["* Murray Dalglish \u2013 Drums"]}, {"page": "Upside Down (The Jesus and Mary Chain song)", "response": ["*Murray Dalglish \u2013 drums (credited, but does not play)"]}]}}
