The first player to have played for both clubs, however, predated the start of the rivalry; Bill Julian joined Royal Arsenal in 1889 and Tottenham in 1894. Many other players played for both clubs before the start of the rivalry, including Charles Ambler, Arthur Elliott, Thomas Fitchie, Tom Pratt, Peter Kyle, and George Payne. A number of players had joined both clubs in the 20th century, but it was only in the 1960s that Laurie Brown became the first player to have played in the North London Derby for both clubs. The players who have played for both since 1919 when the rivalry escalated are listed below."]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (1872\u20131914)", "response": ["|Thomas Fitchie||8,000 ||"]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Thomas Fitchie"]}, {"page": "Fitchie, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Fitchie"]}, {"page": "List of Queen's Park F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Thomas Fitchie"]}]}}
