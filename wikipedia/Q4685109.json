The primary difference between film and the novel is the narrative structure: the book proceeds chronologically from Chris' youth to the early years of his marriage; whereas the film uses flashbacks to his time in Paris.

Finally, in the book, Chris' encounter with another woman at a party was not arranged by Toni, nor is there any indication that Toni has made a pass at Chris' wife Marion.

Capaldi prepared for the audition by downloading old Doctor Who scripts from the Internet and practising in front of a mirror. He discovered he had been given the part during filming for Adrian Hodges' The Musketeers in Prague; after missing a call from his agent, Capaldi rang back to be greeted with \"Hello, Doctor!\" At 55 years old when originally cast, Capaldi was only a few months younger than William Hartnell (the First Doctor) was, when he was cast in the role, and is the oldest actor since Hartnell to star as the Doctor and the third oldest to portray the character.

Based on two books by Colin Clark, it depicts the making of the 1957 film The Prince and the Showgirl, which starred Marilyn Monroe (Williams) and Laurence Olivier (Branagh).

After reading the two books in 2004, Simon Curtis approached producer David Parfitt about making a film based upon them. Parfitt said everyone liked the idea, but because Monroe is so familiar and iconic to people, they wondered what was left to say. Adrian Hodges, who wrote the screenplay, told David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph: \"If you'd said to me one day I'd write a film about her, I'd have been amazed, because I wouldn't have known where to start.\" Gritten reported the saving grace for Hodges was that Clark's books were written about Monroe at a specific time.", "Manohla Dargis of The New York Times thought Branagh was miscast as Olivier, but she said he made up for that with \"his crisp, at times clipped, enunciation and a physical performance that gives Olivier enough vitality so that when, early in, the character sweeps into his production office with his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond, a wan placeholder for the original), he dazzles Clark and jolts this slow-stirring movie awake.\" Of Williams, the film critic said she \"tries her best, and sometimes that's almost enough.\" Dargis said the main problem is with Hodges' script, which \"offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes.\" Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy gave the film four out of five stars and she praised many of the cast's performances. Papamichael added \"While you won't learn anything new about Marilyn Monroe, you can revel in the silky feel of nostalgia.\" Empire magazine's Angie Errigo gave My Week with Marilyn three out of five stars and she said \"At moments hilarious and others touching, it's a sweet, slight affair, more pretty pageant than pithy biographical drama. Expect awards nominations to stack up for Williams and Branagh.\" The Wall Street Journal's film critic, Joe Morgenstern was negative about the film saying, \"When bad movies happen to good people, the first place to look for an explanation is the basic idea.
