They had appointed George Stephenson as their engineer of the line in 1826, and he strongly advocated for the use of steam locomotives instead. As the railway was approaching completion, the directors decided to hold a competition to decide whether locomotives could be used to pull the trains; these became the Rainhill Trials. A prize of \u00a3500 (equal to \u00a3 today) was offered to the winner of the trials. Three notable engineers were selected as judges: John Urpeth Rastrick, a locomotive engineer of Stourbridge, Nicholas Wood, a mining engineer from Killingworth with considerable locomotive design experience, and John Kennedy, a Manchester cotton spinner and a major proponent of the railway."]}, {"page": "John Kennedy (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Kennedy may also refer to:", "*John Kennedy (Australian musician) (born 1958), Australian musician", "*John Kennedy (cellist) (1922\u20131980), Australian musician", "*John Kennedy (born 1965), British DJ with Radio X (United Kingdom)", "*John Kennedy (Irish celebrity) (fl. 1968, 2009), songwriter", "*John Kennedy (American musician) (fl. 1987), American musician", "*John Kennedy (fl. 1620s), English author of the 1626 poem Calanthrop and Lucilla", "*John Kennedy (puppeteer) (born 1968), American puppeteer ", "*John Kennedy Toole (1937\u20131969), American novelist", "*John Kennedy (Brazilian footballer) (born 2002), football forward", "*John Kennedy (English footballer) (born 1978), footballer for Bury Town", "*John Kennedy (Northern Irish footballer) (born 1939), football goalkeeper", "*John Kennedy (Scottish footballer) (born 1983), Scottish footballer and manager", "*John Kennedy (Dublin Gaelic footballer) (fl. 1891\u20131894), Irish Gaelic footballer", "*John Kennedy (Canadian football) (born 1950), Canadian football player", "*John Kennedy Jr. (footballer) (born 1959), former Australian rules footballer", "*John Kennedy (Gaelic footballer) (fl. 1984\u20132010), Gaelic football player and manager", "*John Kennedy Sr. (footballer) (1928\u20132020), Australian football player and coach", "*John Kennedy (canoeist) (fl. 1970s), American canoeist", "*John Kennedy (cricketer) (born 1931), English cricketer", "*John Kennedy (cyclist) (1931\u20131989), British cyclist", "*John Kennedy (hurler) (born 1964), retired Irish hurler", "*John Kennedy (racing driver) (fl. 1970s), American racing driver", "*John Kennedy (rowing) (1900\u20131971), American coxswain", "*John Kennedy (shortstop) (1926\u20131998), American Major League Baseball player", "*John Kennedy (third baseman) (1941\u20132018), American Major League Baseball player", "*John Kennedy (Louisiana politician) (born 1951), United States Senator from Louisiana", "*John Kennedy (Pennsylvania politician) (born 1938), member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives", "*John Kennedy (Utah politician) (1847\u20131928), Utah House of Representatives", "*John Kennedy (Manitoba politician) (1867\u20131927), Canadian politician", "*John Kennedy (public servant) (1884\u2013?), Australian public servant, Controller-General of the Department of Trade and Customs", "*John Kennedy (Medal of Honor) (1834\u20131910), American soldier", "*Sir John Kennedy (British Army officer, born 1878) (1878\u20131948), British general", "*Sir John Kennedy (British Army officer, born 1893) (1893\u20131970), British general", "*John Kennedy (1759\u20131842), English nurseryman, of Lee and Kennedy", "*John Kennedy, 2nd Lord Kennedy (before 1454\u2013c. 1508/9), Scottish lord", "*John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis (1575\u20131615), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis (died 1668), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy, 7th Earl of Cassilis (1653\u20131701), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy, 8th Earl of Cassilis (1700\u20131759), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy (engineer) (1838\u20131921), Canadian civil engineer", "*John Kennedy (manufacturer) (1769\u20131855), Scottish-born textile manufacturer in Manchester, UK", "*John Kennedy (music industry executive) (born 1953), British entertainment lawyer", "*John Kennedy (theologian) (1813\u20131900), British religious leader and author ", "*John Kennedy (journalist) (1926\u20131994), New Zealand newspaper editor and political analyst", "*John Kennedy (The Inbetweeners), in the 2009\u20132010 British sitcom"]}, {"page": "Liverpool and Manchester Railway", "response": ["The original promoters are usually acknowledged to be Joseph Sandars, a rich Liverpool corn merchant, and John Kennedy, owner of the largest spinning mill in Manchester. They were influenced by William James. James was a land surveyor who had made a fortune in property speculation. He advocated a national network of railways, based on what he had seen of the development of colliery lines and locomotive technology in the north of England."]}, {"page": "Liverpool Lime Street railway station", "response": ["Having realised that their existing Crown Street railway station was too far away from the city centre, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway commenced construction of the more central Lime Street station in October 1833. Designed by John Cunningham, Arthur Holme, and John Foster Jr, it was officially opened in August 1836. Proving to be very popular with train commuters, expansion of the station had become necessary within six years of its opening. The first expansion, which was collaboratively produced by Joseph Locke, Richard Turner, William Fairbairn, and John Kennedy, was completed in 1849 at a total cost of \u00a315,000 (). During 1867 work upon a further expansion of Lime Street station commenced, during which time the present northern arched train shed was built. Designed by William Baker and Francis Stevenson, the train shed was the largest such structure in the world upon completion, featuring a span of , as well as the first to make extensive use of iron. During 1879 a second parallel southern train shed was completed.", "Lime Street Station was a near-instant success with the railway-going public. Within six years of its opening, the rapid growth of the railways had necessitated the expansion of the original station. An early plan for the enlarged station would have involved the erection of an iron roof, similar to that found at Euston station (pre 1960's rebuilding) in London, which was a ridge roof supported by iron columns. However, a different proposal quickly gained the approval of the station committee. A single curved roof was produced by a collaborative effort; designed and load tested by engineer Joseph Locke, with construction contracted to iron founder Richard Turner, and the work checked by engineer William Fairbairn and manufacturer John Kennedy. The expansion work was performed at a cost of \u00a315,000 () and was completed during 1849, by which time the noted architect William Tite had also been involved. Meanwhile, during 1845, the L&MR had been absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR); the following year the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway. Amongst the features which date back to the 1846\u20131849 rebuild of the station are a group of four columns which adjoin former Platform 1, they have been attributed to engineer Edward Woods."]}, {"page": "Samuel Crompton", "response": ["In 1800, a sum of \u00a3500 was raised for his benefit by subscription, and when in 1809, Edmund Cartwright, the inventor of the power loom, obtained \u00a310,000 from parliament, Crompton was determined to apply for a grant. In 1811, he toured the manufacturing districts of Lancashire and Scotland to collect evidence showing how extensively his mule was being used, and in 1812 parliament awarded him \u00a35000. With the aid of this money, Crompton started a business as a bleacher and then as a cotton merchant and spinner, but without success. In 1824, some friends and members (including Isaac and Benjamin Dobson, Benjamin Hick, John Kennedy and Peter Rothwell) of Bolton's Black Horse \"prosecution\" Club, bought him an annuity of \u00a363 without his knowledge."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Hick", "response": ["The Dobsons (Isaac and Benjamin), Hick, Rothwell, John Kennedy and others were members of a \"prosecution\" club (formed 1801), meeting at the Black Horse pub in Bolton, that in 1824 secured an annuity for the inventor and fellow member Samuel Crompton, who also frequented the Inn. Hick joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in the same year, proposed by Joshua Field, Joseph Farey and James Jones. Also with Rothwell and the Dobsons, Hick was a prominent member of the Black Horse Club, that met \"to discuss not only business matters but the most interesting topics affecting that period\"."]}, {"page": "Spinning mule", "response": ["In 1790, William Kelly of Glasgow used a new method to assist the draw stroke. First animals, and then water, was used as the prime mover. Wright of Manchester moved the head stock to the centre of the machine, allowing twice as many spindles; a squaring band was added to ensure the spindles came out in a straight line. He was in conversation with John Kennedy about the possibility of a self-acting mule. Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in Ancoats, was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules; their firm prospered and eventually merged into the Fine Spinners & Doublers Association. In 1793, John Kennedy was addressing the problem of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse. He attached gears and a clutch to implement this motion."]}, {"page": "Ardwick Hall", "response": ["Ardwick Hall was constructed at some time before 1794, and was originally occupied by Samuel Hyde, after his death the hall was passed on to linen merchant Robert Hyde who was the uncle of British textile mill owner Samuel Greg (1758\u20131834). Robert died in 1785, and the Hall was inherited by brother Nathan Hyde, who owned it until his death 24 October 1795. It was owned in the mid-19th century by textile magnate John Kennedy"]}]}}
