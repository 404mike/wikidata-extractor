He ran for Great Britain, Notts AC and UWIC.\nOn 10 June 2006, Richard won the A-race of the BMC Grand Prix event at Watford in a time of 1:45.10. This time made Richard British No 1 for 2006. The race itself was notable too, because due to second placed Michael Rimmer and third placed Sam Ellis also running good times, British athletes held the top 3 places in the European 800m rankings (for a short while). This was the first time this had occurred in over 20 years.\nRichard competed for GB at the European Championships in Gothenburg in 2006.\nRichard has an elder brother, Craig, who competed at county level in cross country helping pave a successful path for Richard in athletics.  Craig also has won the national BCC titles in volleyball and football showing sporting genes run in the family.\nRichard, who also had trial spells with Leeds United FC, attributes his success to his PE teacher, parents and older brother.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Hill", "response": ["Richard Hill may refer to:", "* Richard Hill of Hawkstone (1655\u20131727), English diplomat and protector of the Vaudois", "* Richard Hill (Pennsylvania politician) (died 1729), mayor of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "* Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet (1732\u20131808), English religious revivalist and politician", "* Richard Hill (New South Wales politician) (1810\u20131895), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* Richard Hill (Queensland politician) (1885\u20131959), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "* Richard Hill, 7th Baron Sandys (1931\u20132013), British landowner and Conservative politician", "* Richard Hill (Jamaica) (1795\u20131872), mixed-race Jamaican lawyer who campaigned for the rights of free coloureds", "* Richard Hill (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131971), England international footballer", "* Richard Hill (footballer, born 1963), former Northampton Town F.C. and Watford F.C. footballer", "* Richard Hill (rugby union, born 1961) (born 1961), played scrum-half for Bath and England, and later coached Gloucester, Bristol, and Worcester", "* Richard Hill (rugby union, born 1973) (born 1973), played flanker for Saracens, England and the British and Irish Lions", "* Richard Hill (runner), English middle-distance runner", "* Richard Hill (cricketer, born 1861) (1861\u20131924), Somerset cricketer", "* Richard Hill (cricketer, born 1900) (1900\u20131959)", "* Richard Hill (bishop) (died 1496), Bishop of London and Archdeacon of Lewes", "* Richard Hill (priest) (1782\u20131836), Church of England clergyman, born in London, served in Sydney, Australia", "* Richard Hill (martyr) (died 1590), Catholic priest and martyr", "* Richard Hill (musician) (born 1942), British contemporary composer", "* J.
