His voice has been described as an \"elegant, seductive croon\". He also established a distinctive image and sartorial style; according to The Independent, Ferry and his contemporary David Bowie influenced a generation with both their music and their appearances. Peter York described Ferry as \"an art object\" who \"should hang in the Tate\".Ferry came to prominence as the lead singer and main songwriter with the glam art rock band Roxy Music, achieving three no. 1 albums and 10 singles which reached the top 10 in the UK between 1972 and 1982. Their singles included \"Virginia Plain\", \"Street Life\", \"Love Is the Drug\", \"Dance Away\", \"Angel Eyes\", \"Over You\", \"Oh Yeah\", \"Jealous Guy\", \"Avalon\", and \"More Than This\".\nFerry began his solo career in 1973, while still a member of Roxy Music. His early solo hits include \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", \"Let's Stick Together\" and \"This Is Tomorrow\". Ferry disbanded Roxy Music following the release of their best-selling album Avalon in 1982 to concentrate on his solo career, releasing further singles such as \"Slave to Love\" and \"Don't Stop the Dance\" and the UK no. 1 album Boys and Girls in 1985. When his sales as a solo artist and as a member of Roxy Music are combined, Ferry has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.As well as being a prolific songwriter himself, Ferry has recorded many cover versions of other artists' songs, including standards from the Great American Songbook, in albums such as These Foolish Things (1973), Another Time, Another Place (1974), Let's Stick Together (1976) and As Time Goes By (1999), as well as Dylanesque (2007), an album of Bob Dylan covers. In 2019, Ferry was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King Crimson", "response": ["After a search for a drummer to replace McCulloch, Ian Wallace was secured. Fripp was re-energised by the addition of a new member, he joined Collins and Wallace to audition singers and bassists. Vocalists who tried out included Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry and John Gaydon, one of the band's managers. The position eventually went to Raymond \"Boz\" Burrell. John Wetton was invited to join on bass, but declined to play with Family instead. Rick Kemp (later of Steeleye Span) rehearsed with the band, but declined an offer to formally join. Fripp decided to teach Boz to play bass rather than continue the labored auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough acoustic guitar to assist him in learning the instrument quickly. Wallace was able to further instruct Burrell in functioning on the instrument in a rhythm section. With a line-up now complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical differences between Fripp and the rest of the group, and the somewhat wild lifestyles of Collins, Wallace and Burrell alienated the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Smeeton", "response": ["*1990s: Robert Gallup - Extreme Magic [Fox Television]; Sinead O'Connor; Phil Collins; Stone Roses; Barry White (video); TLC [video]; Kylie Minogue; Toni Braxton [video]; Def Leppard; Dwight Yoakam; Billy Idol; Adam Sandler [HBO]; Peter Gabriel; Jane's Addiction; The Human League; Yes; Jim Brickman; Chris Isaak; Sammy Hagar; Bryan Ferry; Richie Sambora."]}, {"page": "Roxy Music", "response": ["Roxy Music were  an English rock band formed in 1970 by Bryan Ferry\u2014who became the band's lead singer and main songwriter\u2014and bass guitarist Graham Simpson. The other longtime members were Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe), and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion). Other members included Brian Eno (synthesizer and 'treatments'), Eddie Jobson (synthesizer and violin), and John Gustafson (bass). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently over the next few years. Ferry frequently enlisted band members as session musicians for his solo releases.", "In November 1970, Bryan Ferry, who had just lost his job teaching ceramics at a girls' school for holding impromptu record-listening sessions, advertised for a keyboard-player to collaborate with him and Graham Simpson, a bass-player he knew from his Newcastle art-college band, the Gas Board, and with whom he collaborated on his first songs. In early 1970 Ferry had auditioned as lead singer for King Crimson, who were seeking a replacement for Greg Lake. While Robert Fripp and Pete Sinfield decided Ferry's voice was unsuitable for King Crimson's material, they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a contract with E.G. Records.", "On the first two Roxy albums, all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry. Beginning with Stranded, Mackay and Manzanera began to co-write some material. Gradually, their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band's sound, although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter; throughout their career, all but one of Roxy's singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry (Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band's B-sides). Stranded was released in November 1973, and produced the top-10 single \"Street Life\".", "Later, with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes, the band's eighth\u2014and final\u2014studio album, Avalon (1982), recorded at Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, was a major commercial success and restored the group's critical reputation(Rolling Stone: \"Avalon takes a long time to kick in, but it finally does, and it's a good one.\") and contained the successful single \"More Than This\". The album also included several Roxy Music classics, such as \"Avalon\", \"The Main Thing\", \"The Space Between\", \"True to Life\", and \"To Turn You On\". The trio (augmented by session players) toured extensively until 1983, when Bryan Ferry dissolved the band, and band members devoted themselves full-time to solo careers.", "In 2005, Tim de Lisle of The Guardian argued that Roxy Music are the second most influential British band after the Beatles. He wrote, \"Somehow, in a landscape dominated by Led Zeppelin at one end and the Osmonds at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock'n'roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos. And although their popularity has ebbed and flowed, their influence has been strikingly consistent.\" In 2019, The Economist also described them as \"the best British art-rock band since the Beatles\", arguing that \"among English rock acts of that time, their spirit of adventure and their impact\" was \"surpassed only\" by David Bowie. Bowie himself cited Roxy Music as one of his favourite British groups and in a 1975 television interview described Bryan Ferry as \"spearheading some of the best music to come out of England.\"", "Roxy Music's sound and visual style have been described as a significant influence on later genres and subcultures such as electronic music, punk rock, disco, new wave and new romantic. Madness are among the artists that have cited Roxy Music as an influence. They paid tribute to Bryan Ferry in the song \"4BF\" (the title is a reference to the song \"2HB\", itself a tribute to Humphrey Bogart from the first Roxy Music album). Other artists who have cited or been described as influenced by Roxy Music include Nile Rodgers, Kate Bush, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Duran Duran, Adam and the Ants, U2, the Smiths, Depeche Mode, Nick Cave, Spandau Ballet, Radiohead, Scissor Sisters, Talking Heads, Simple Minds, Steven Wilson, Garbage, Placebo, Imogen Heap, Goldfrapp, Pulp, The Sex Pistols, the Human League, Todd Terje and Franz Ferdinand.", "Roxy Music's work has been featured in a number of soundtracks for both film and television. Multiple Roxy Music songs were featured in the soundtrack to the 2006 BBC fantasy-police drama series Life on Mars set in 1970s Manchester.  \"Same Old Scene\" plays over the closing credits of the 2008 pilot episode for Life on Mars' sequel series Ashes to Ashes, during both the opening and end credits of the 1980 film Times Square, and is featured in a party scene in the 2018 film Can You Ever Forgive Me? The track Love Is the Drug is featured in 1995 Martin Scorsese film Casino. The track If There Is Something plays a symbolic role in the 2008 drama/coming of age movie Flashbacks of a Fool directed by Baillie Walsh and starring Daniel Craig. In the film, the younger version of Craig's character is also shown dressing up as Bryan Ferry during a flashback scene set in the 1970s. Sofia Coppola's 2003 film Lost in Translation features Bill Murray's character Bob Harris singing an off-key version of \"More Than This\" in a karaoke club. It was used on a Nissan TV advertisement in 1999. More Than This also is danced to by Toni Collette's character in the 2019 mystery film Knives Out and was featured in the Cold War set television show The Americans. The title song Avalon of the 1982 album of the same name was featured in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business. Guy Ritchie's 2020 black comedy crime film The Gentlemen features \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\" during an action sequence.", "Roxy Music's iconic 24 August 1972 television appearance on the BBC's Top of the Pops, performing their single \"Virginia Plain\", was affectionately parodied on two occasions on different British TV comedy programs. The first parody was performed by the cast of the sketch comedy series Big Train (Series 1, Episode 6) in 1998; in the show's closing sketch, a dying Chairman Mao (played by Kevin Eldon) appears to expire, but then rises from his deathbed to perform \"Virginia Plain\" in the style of Bryan Ferry, accompanied by the rest of the  cast members (plus series co-writer Arthur Mathews) dressed as the members of Roxy Music.

The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile, which was re-titled We Don't Talk Anymore for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years, and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world.
