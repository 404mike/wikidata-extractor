This planet is nearly 50% more massive than Jupiter () and takes 407 days to orbit the star in an extremely circular orbit. In 2000 a group of scientists proposed, based on preliminary Hipparcos astrometrical satellite data, that the orbital inclination of HD 177830 b is as little as 1.3\u00b0. If that was the case, the planet would have a mass of , making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet. However, it is very unlikely that the planet would have such orbit. Furthermore, brown dwarfs with short orbits around solar-mass () stars are exceedingly rare (the so-called \"brown dwarf desert\") making the claim even more unlikely."]}, {"page": "David Hughes (astronomer)", "response": ["File:Neil McBride and & Peter Jalowiczor; David W.

This candidate object is estimated to be orbiting the parent star with a period of \u00a0days at an eccentricity of . The semi-major axis for this Keplerian orbit is an estimated 0.6873\u00a0Astronomical Units. Because the inclination of the orbit remains unknown, the mass of this companion has not been determined. However, it can be constrained to have a mass of at least 21% the mass of Jupiter. There is no evidence of additional companions in the system."]}, {"page": "Jalowiczor, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Jalowiczor"]}]}}
