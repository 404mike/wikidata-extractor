The films were produced and written by Mike Myers, who also starred as the title character and Dr. Evil. They were directed by Jay Roach and distributed by New Line Cinema.\nThe franchise parodies numerous films, TV shows and characters \u2014 including the James Bond series, Jason King, Danger Man, The Prisoner, The Man from U. N. C. L. E., Matt Helm and The Avengers, to name just a few \u2014 and incorporates myriad other elements of popular culture as it follows a British spy's quest to bring his nemesis down. The character represents an archetype of 1960s Swinging London, with his advocacy of free love, his use of obscure impressions and his clothing style.\nThe films poke fun at the outrageous plots, rampant sexual innuendo, and two dimensional stock characters associated with 1960s spy films, as well as the clich\u00e9 of the ultra suave super spy.\nThe general theme of the films is that the arch villain Dr. Evil plots to extort large sums of money from governments or international bodies but is constantly thwarted by Powers, and (to a degree) his own inexperience with life and culture in the 1990s.\nIn Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin and Dr. Evil are awakened after being cryogenically frozen for thirty years. Continuing to incorporate cultural elements of the 1960s and 1970s, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers in Goldmember feature time travel as a plot device and deliberately overlook inconsistencies. A proposed fourth film, Austin Powers 4, has reportedly been in development since 2005, but has since been stalled.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fictional robots and androids", "response": ["* The seductive Fembot assassins in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) and in the rest of the Austin Powers series; in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), it's revealed that the character Vanessa Kensington was a fembot, and in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), Britney Spears plays herself as one."]}, {"page": "Adam Adamant Lives!", "response": ["\"Adamant\" is frequently viewed as partial inspiration for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.http://www.clivebanks.co.uk/Adam%20Intro.htm Banks, Clive. \"Adam Adamant Lives!\".http://www.clivebanks.co.uk/Adam%20Intro.htm \"Austin Powers \u2014 the Movie Trilogy\". h2g2. 4 February 2003.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/movieconnections IMDB's list of movie connections for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.
