Godley spent nearly his entire adult life in fashion, working for David Evans & Co. Silk Printers (London), Mantero Silk Printers and Weavers (Como, Italy), and Drakes of London. Godley designed ties for gentleman's bespoke clothier Turnbull & Asser in London from 1996\u201397 and Drakes of London from 1997-2004 before being asked to the United States from London to serve as Creative Director for Polo Ralph Lauren.In 2005, Godley founded men's contemporary label Psycho Bunny with friend and business partner Robert Goldman. Handmade from English silk, Psycho Bunny neckwear features everything from tiny spades to Donnie Darko-style rabbit skulls, the latter inspiring the label's oddball name. \"When I showed that tie to a buyer, she said, 'Look at the psycho bunny!'\" Godley says. \"The name stuck.\" Since the initial launch of the Psycho Bunny neckwear collection, the brand has expanded into multiple categories including polo shirts and t-shirts, bottoms, cashmere scarves and socks, and most recently a golf collection.Godley is an avid fisherman and owns a 33-foot center console fishing boat he named \"Ginger Ninja\", a term of endearment he gave his son. He is also an active philanthropist, most noticeably supporting Big Brothers Big Sisters of Long Island with a special limited edition collection of Psycho Bunny t-shirts designed after Ginger Ninja.Godley currently resides between New York City and Hampton Bays, New York.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jane Krakowski", "response": ["Krakowski became engaged to Robert Godley in 2009.
