He was educated at Westminster School and the University of G\u00f6ttingen, and then studied law at Lincolns Inn, but hardly practised as a barrister.\nHe hoped to gain office as Under-secretary of State to Charles James Fox, but he was in opposition.  Following the French Revolution, he travelled in Europe, visiting Berlin, Vienna, and St Petersburg to study the effects of the revolution and equip himself for a diplomatic career.\nHe became Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Appleby (1799\u20131802) and Camelford (1802\u201312).\nIn 1805, he made a disastrous marriage to Ang\u00e9lique Gabrielle, daughter of the marquis de l'Escuyer d'Hazincourt (known as \u2018Talleyrand's spy\u2019), but this kept him out of office when Fox returned to government. Instead Fox sent him to Vienna.  In June 1808, George Canning transferred him to Constantinople. He was created a KCB in that year for his services there. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1828.\nHe was employed in Belgium from 1831 to 1835, where he succeeded in preventing a war between Belgium and The Netherlands. This exploit won for him the rank of GCB and a pension  of \u00a32000 per year from 1831, and also the grand'cross of the Belgian order of Leopold in 1835. He then visited Prussia.  In the 1840s, he published memoirs of his diplomatic activities in the 1800s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Savage Landor", "response": ["For the next three years Landor led an unsettled life, spent mainly in London. He became a friend of the classics scholar Dr Samuel Parr who lived at Hatton near Warwick and who appreciated Landor as a person and a Latin writer. Landor favoured Latin as a way of expressing playful material without exposing it to public view \"Siquid forte iocosius cuivis in mentem veniat, id, vernacule, puderet, non-enim tantummodo in luce agitur sed etiam in publico.\"Titus Bicknell, \"Calamus Ense Potentior Est: Walter Savage Landor's Poetic War of Words.\" Romanticism On the Net Number 4  Latin also had the advantage of being exempt from libel laws in England. Parr introduced Landor to Robert Adair, party organiser for Charles James Fox, who enlisted Landor to write in The Morning Post and The Courier against the ministry of Pitt. Landor published \"Poems from the Arabic and Persian\" in 1800 and a pamphlet of Latin verses. During this time he met Isaac Mocatta who stimulated his interest in art and exercised a moderating influence, but Mocatta died 1801. In 1802 Landor went to Paris where he saw Napoleon at close quarters, and this was enough for him to revoke his former praise for Napoleon in Gebir. In the same year he published \"Poetry by the Author of Gebir\" which included the narrative poems Crysaor and The Phocaeans. Colvin considered Crysaor Landor's finest piece of narrative in blank verse."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: A", "response": ["|Sir Robert Adair"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1820\u20131837)", "response": ["*Robert Adair (1763\u20131855)"]}, {"page": "Frederick Chamier", "response": ["After the campaign the Salsette was ordered to the Mediterranean and while at Smyrna on 11 April 1810 met with Lord Byron who on hearing the ship was making for Constantinople asked Captain Bathurst for a lift.

There Byron sat down on the tomb of Patroclus, and pulled out his copy of Homer and read for his companions. Chamier would become a lifelong devotee,  and sprinkle his own books in the future with many Byronic quotations.  Later in May 1810, Chamier watched Byron on his famous swim across the Hellespont from Europe to Asia at the second attempt. He described the episode in his autobiography.

The French army under Marshal \u00c9tienne G\u00e9rard crossed the border the next day. The Dutch had taken a risk by invading Belgium without the support of their allies: Russia had wanted to assist but was having trouble suppressing the Polish revolution, and Prussia would not risk sending troops without Russia being able to secure its western borders; now they faced a possible war with the French. After an intervention by the British diplomat Robert Adair, the Dutch halted their advance and a ceasefire was signed on 12 August.
