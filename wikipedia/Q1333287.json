He was educated at Westminster School and the University of G\u00f6ttingen, and then studied law at Lincolns Inn, but hardly practised as a barrister.\nHe hoped to gain office as Under-secretary of State to Charles James Fox, but he was in opposition.  Following the French Revolution, he travelled in Europe, visiting Berlin, Vienna, and St Petersburg to study the effects of the revolution and equip himself for a diplomatic career.\nHe became Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Appleby (1799\u20131802) and Camelford (1802\u201312).\nIn 1805, he made a disastrous marriage to Ang\u00e9lique Gabrielle, daughter of the marquis de l'Escuyer d'Hazincourt (known as \u2018Talleyrand's spy\u2019), but this kept him out of office when Fox returned to government. Instead Fox sent him to Vienna.  In June 1808, George Canning transferred him to Constantinople. He was created a KCB in that year for his services there. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1828.\nHe was employed in Belgium from 1831 to 1835, where he succeeded in preventing a war between Belgium and The Netherlands. This exploit won for him the rank of GCB and a pension  of \u00a32000 per year from 1831, and also the grand'cross of the Belgian order of Leopold in 1835. He then visited Prussia.  In the 1840s, he published memoirs of his diplomatic activities in the 1800s.", "link_mentions": {}}}
