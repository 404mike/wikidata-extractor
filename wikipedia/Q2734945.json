Simpson retired from scriptwriting in 1978, becoming an after-dinner speaker, while Galton collaborated in several projects with Johnny Speight."]}, {"page": "Denis Norden", "response": ["After the war, Norden wrote material for comedian Dick Bentley, before meeting Frank Muir (who wrote for comic actor Jimmy Edwards) in 1947; they were brought together by producer Ted Kavanagh. Muir and Norden's first joint venture was a radio show for both performers, Take it from Here!, which they scripted from 1948 to 1959. They went on to write many successful radio and television scripts, including Whack-O! (1956\u20131960) and three series of Faces of Jim (1961\u20131963) which were vehicles for Jimmy Edwards. They also wrote the satirical sketch Balham, Gateway to the South for the BBC Third Programme. The sketch, which had originally been broadcast in 1948 as part of a comedy series called The Third Division and which featured actor Robert Beatty, was later performed by Peter Sellers for his LP, The Best of Sellers (1959). In the early 1960s, Muir and Norden wrote the sitcom Brothers in Law, an early series featuring Richard Briers, and its spin-off Mr Justice Duncannon."]}, {"page": "Lynn Redgrave", "response": ["In 1967, she made her Broadway debut in Black Comedy with Michael Crawford and Geraldine Page.

Retrieved 26 May 2019 with Terry-Thomas noting that he provided \"no nepotic help\" in getting Briers the part. The film was not well received by the critics; an internal BBC memo described that in the UK the film was \"murdered by the critics\", although it was \"something of a success\" in America. By this time Terry-Thomas had decided to stop being a stand-up comedian and compere and instead concentrate solely on making films. He stopped appearing on television and radio shows of his own, declaring \"it was the cinema for me and me for the cinema!\" Having accumulated considerable experience by appearing in British films, he decided to try Hollywood, and moved to America.", "By 1984 Terry-Thomas was increasingly depressed by his condition.  When he was interviewed that year, he said that \"one doctor said I've got about four more years to live. God forbid! I shall probably blow my brains out first\". In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain and moved back to London. They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors there, and was shocked by the change he saw: \"Sitting there, motionless, he was just a mere shadow. A crippled, crushed, shadow. It was really bloody awful.\"", "Some of the innovations Terry-Thomas brought into his earlier television programmes were later copied by others; How Do You View? provided the \"prologue\" format of Up Pompeii!, and was the first to use regular BBC announcers as foils in comic sketches\u2014a practice continued later, particularly with the shows of Morecambe and Wise. Terry-Thomas's anecdotes, stringing several stories together, later inspired Ronnie Corbett in his monologue spot in his series The Two Ronnies.

Between 1971 and 1973 Lowe joined Dad's Army colleague Ian Lavender, on the BBC radio comedy Parsley Sidings and he played Mr Micawber in a BBC television serial of David Copperfield (1974).

In the 1995 film A Midwinter's Tale by Kenneth Branagh, two actors discuss Irving, and one of them, Richard Briers does an imitation of his speech.

In the DVD special features, it is mentioned that both John Nathan-Turner and Andrew Cartmel were unhappy with his performance during the recording, and Briers admits he ignored directions to tone it down. Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, described Briers' performance as a \"career low\", stating Briers is \"shockingly bad in this story...there\u2019s no escaping the fact that the Chief Caretaker, the key baddie in Paradise Towers, is just Richard Briers in a silly cap, silly moustache, putting on a silly voice. Mugging for England. Sending up Doctor Who in a horribly misjudged, self-indulgent performance, especially after the Caretaker has been 'zombified' by the Great Architect.

This effect, known to animators as \"boiling\", gives an energetic character to the show, and was a contrast to the slick, smooth colouring of the American Hanna-Barbera shows that were being shown on British television. The series was voiced by actor Richard Briers and the theme tune was written by Johnny Hawksworth for de Wolfe Music. It was the first fully animated television series to be made in the United Kingdom. The series was later shown in reruns on the American children's television series Eureeka's Castle on Nickelodeon, with an American dub.", "A new series titled Roobarb and Custard Too debuted on Channel 5 on 8 August 2005. Like the original series, it was written by Grange Calveley and narrated by Richard Briers. The series introduced a large number of other animal characters who also got involved in Roobarb's schemes. It was produced by Adam Sharp and Bernadette O'Riordan for A&B TV, and directed by Jason Tammemagi; the animation was by the Irish company Monster Animation & Design. The revival used computer animation, but kept the \"wobbly\" look and plain white backgrounds from the original series. The music for the revival was by Jon Atkinson. There were 39 episodes."]}]}}
