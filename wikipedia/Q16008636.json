He scored 1,413 runs with a highest score of 124 not out and completed one stumping and 20 catches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Leicestershire had fourteen defeats and finished fourteenth. In Les Berry, they had the only professional captain in the County Championship. In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, Vic Jackson, Gerry Lester, Francis Prentice, Maurice Tompkin and George Watson all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder Anthony Riddington scored over 800. Wicketkeeper Percy Corrall claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was Jack Walsh, a great exponent of slow left-arm wrist-spin, who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran James Sperry bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler. Other players were Thomas Chapman, Jack Howard and Harry Pickering.Playfair, pp. 106\u2013107."]}, {"page": "Thomas Chapman", "response": ["Thomas Chapman may refer to:", "* Thomas Chapman (actor) (1683\u20131747), British stage actor", "* Thomas Chapman (Australian politician) (1815\u20131884), Premier of Tasmania", "* Thomas Chapman (bishop) (1867\u20131949), Anglican bishop", "* Thomas Chapman (Master of Magdalene College) (1717\u20131760), English churchman and academic", "* Sir Thomas Chapman, 2nd Baronet, Irish landowner", "* Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet (1846\u20131919), Anglo-Irish landowner", "* Thomas Chapman (footballer) (1871\u20131929), English footballer", "* Thomas Chapman (cricketer) (1918\u20131979), English cricketer", "* Thomas Chapman (MP) (1663\u2013?), British lawyer and politician"]}]}}
