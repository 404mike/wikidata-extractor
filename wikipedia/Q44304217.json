He began his career as a student at the Royal Manchester College of Music and from 1982 to 1987 was principal tenor with the Welsh National Opera Company.  Lawton also sang with Opera North and the Scottish Opera. On one occasion in 1990 he substituted for the ill Pl\u00e1cido Domingo in the role of Otello at the Royal Opera, London under Carlos Kleiber. As well as singing at various British festivals and the BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall, other pursuits included president of the Wagner Society Manchester and patron of the Oldham Choral Society. Lawton was a tutor and a Fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music (FRNCM).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Otello", "response": ["Since the three leading roles of the opera (Otello, Desdemona and Iago) are among Verdi's most demanding, both vocally and dramatically, some of the most illustrious singers of the past 130 years have made Otello part of their repertoire. Famous Otellos of the past have included Tamagno, the role's trumpet-voiced creator, as well as Giovanni Battista De Negri, Albert Alvarez, Francesc Vi\u00f1as, Giuseppe Borgatti, Antonio Paoli, Giovanni Zenatello, Renato Zanelli, Giovanni Martinelli, Aureliano Pertile, Francesco Merli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, Frank Mullings, Leo Slezak, Jose Luccioni, Ram\u00f3n Vinay, Mario Del Monaco, James McCracken, Jon Vickers, David Rendall, Jeffrey Lawton and Carlo Cossutta. Pre-Second World War Wagnerian tenors such as Jacques Urlus, Heinrich Knote, Alexander Kirchner, Lauritz Melchior and Franz V\u00f6lker also undertook the part (usually singing it in German). The Russian heroic tenor Ivan Yershov was a renowned pre-World War I Otello in his native country. His compatriot Arnold Azrikan achieved his greatest recognition as a dramatic tenor in Otello. For this performance he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946."]}, {"page": "Royal Manchester College of Music", "response": ["*Jeffrey Lawton, tenor"]}, {"page": "Opera North: history and repertoire, seasons 1990\u201391 to 1996\u201397", "response": ["|1991\u201392 || Boris Godunov ||  Mussorgsky ||  John Tomlinson (Boris), Paul Charles Clarke (Grigory), Jeffrey Lawton (Shuisky), Matthew Best (Pimen) ||  Paul Daniel || colspan=\"2\"|  Revival of 1988\u201389 production", "|1992\u201393 || Wozzeck ||  Berg ||  Andrew Shore (Wozzeck), Vivian Tierney (Marie), Jeffrey Lawton (Captain), John Rath (Doctor), Alan Woodrow (Drum-Major) ||  Paul Daniel ||  Deborah Warner ||  Hildegard Bechtler/Nicky Gillibrand", "|1996\u201397 || Tannh\u00e4user ||  Wagner ||  Jeffrey Lawton  (Tannh\u00e4user), Rita Cullis (Elisabeth), Anne-Marie (Venus), Keith Latham (Wolfram), Norman Bailey (Landgrave) ||  Paul Daniel/James Holmes ||  David Fielding ||  David Fielding"]}, {"page": "Opera North: history and repertoire, seasons 2004\u2013", "response": ["|2005\u201306 || Der Kuhhandel ||  Weill ||  Leonardo Capalbo (Juan), Mary Plazas/Deborah Norman (Juanita), Jeffrey Lawton (Mendez), Adrian Clarke (Jones), Robert Burt (Ximenes), Donald Maxwell (Conchas) ||  James Holmes ||  David Pountney ||  Duncan Hayler"]}]}}
