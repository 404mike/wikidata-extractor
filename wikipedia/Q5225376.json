According to an analysis by linguist Darryl Francis and locals, there is no landform known as Torpenhow Hill there, either officially or locally, which would make the term an example of a ghost word.

Together with Darryl Francis he has produced every edition of Official Scrabble Words by Chambers and has more recently worked with HarperCollins on their official wordlist book.

The magazine was first published in May 1972 by Edu-Games (UK) Ltd. The first editor was Graeme Levin who recruited a variety of games and puzzles experts as writers and consultant editors including Darryl Francis, David Parlett, David Pritchard, Don Turnbull, Eric Solomon, Gyles Brandreth, Nick Palmer, R. C. Bell, Richard Sharp, Sid Sackson and Tony Buzan. This gave it a good reputation; for example, Popular Computing wrote \"Quite simply, Games & Puzzles Magazine is unique. There is no other publication quite like it anywhere in the world.\" Its headquarters was in London."]}, {"page": "Beyond Language", "response": ["In the decades since its publication, the book's Problems and Bafflers have proved a fruitful source of logological research.  Many of them have been further investigated and developed by A. Ross Eckler, Jr.; Philip M. Cohen; members of the National Puzzlers' League; and others.  Other claims made by the book have been challenged and debunked.  Of note is a 2003 study by Darryl Francis which investigated Borgmann's assertion that the name \"Torpenhow Hill\" is a quadruple etymological tautology. It concluded not only that Borgmann's etymology may be incorrect, but also that the hill does not even exist."]}]}}
