When researching the Dartmoor legend of Childe's Tomb folklorist Theo Brown also drew comparisons between the slaying of the stoor worm and Jonah's three-day confinement inside a whale. Hartland concluded that tales of this genre were confined to countries beginning to move away from primitive beliefs and possibly evolved \"out of the suppression of human sacrifices to divinities in bestial form.\""]}, {"page": "Theo Brown folklorist", "response": ["#REDIRECT Theo Brown"]}, {"page": "Ethel Rudkin", "response": ["In 1938, Rudkin published what became a seminal paper on the mythology of the Black Dog in Lincolnshire and is one of the most complete for any region of England, including songs, sightings and folktales. By 1958, the folklorist Theo Brown was referring to Rudkin's \"famous article\" in her own research. One interesting aspect for folklorists today is that Rudkin did not just record malevolent appearances of the dog, but also times when people reported that the dog was protecting them from other apparitions. Rudkin claimed that the phenomenon was viewed in a more positive light in Lincolnshire than in other counties. She also recorded instances of 'black dogs' named and known by local communities. In fact, she was the first researcher to empirically categorise 'black dog' sightings.Carr, Kiersten, \"Hellhounds and Helpful Ghost Dogs: Conflicting Perceptions of \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d Encoded in Supernatural Narrative\" (2018).
