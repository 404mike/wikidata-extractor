Foy went on to describe Tony as being famous for his \"many on-screen relationships, affairs and engagements\" but always has plenty of heartache. The Daily Star described Tony as going \"through more women than he\u2019s served hot meals in his restaurant Gnosh\" before adding that he is a \"loser-in-love\". They commented that after dumping Cindy \"this time he\u2019s only got himself to blame\". On the character Sky said: \"Tony Hutchinson is our fave character on the show. Probably because he's been on it the whole time since it started in 1995\". An Inside Soap critic responded negatively to a plot centring on Tony catering for the college ball saying \"Just who do the Hollyoaks writers think they are catering for with a plot like this? Do us a favour and serve up something decent!\" The Liverpool Echos Caroline Corcoran reviewed Hollyoaks: Movin' On saying the spinoff provided \"an insight in to Tony's character that we don't get in Hollyoaks, and I actually found myself feeling for a character that is normally written to be deliberately irritating\". Another critic for Inside Soap felt Hollyoaks was back to a high standard before adding that \"Tony Hutchinson has been on fine comedy form following the disastrous transformation of his garden by 'Charlie Dimmock'\". Inside Soaps Lucy said that \"You've got to feel sorry for Hollyoaks's Tony Hutchinson ... Give the man a break!\" Following Tony's relationship with Mandy becoming troubled. Lucy's colleague Sam also reviewed the storyline saying: \"Feel sorry for Tony? Oh get over it! He deserves everything he's got coming to him. What is Mandy doing with him anyway? He's far too old, a total fuddy duddy, and has had the same naff hairstyle for seven years!\" While reflecting on \"some of soap's more memorable business ideas\", an Inside Soap writer, on Tony's business ideas, said: \"Tony Hutchinson, is not so much the king of money-making schemes - more of an old skin-flint ... he came up with the idea of recycling all his guest's used water ... When his recycling racket was discovered, his claims that it was just an innovative method of being environmentally friendly wouldn't wash - we all knew it was just his cheap-skate way of reducing his water bill! However, to this day his roses continue to bloom strangely well\". Inside Soap critic Sam expressed disinterest in a storyline in which Tony and Ruth kiss, questioning if they have \"gone back in time or something?\" Merle Brown of the Daily Record bemoaned the lack of realism in Tony's storylines saying: \"why on earth would Izzy go out with Tony? Yes, she's slightly irritating, but in the real world would a man like Tony honestly have a constant stream of girlfriends?\" During the Enjoy The Ride storyline, Inside Soaps Sarah said \"there are standout performances from some of my all-time favourite Hollyoaks stars\" which she said included Pickard."]}, {"page": "Alexandra Park, Hastings", "response": ["In April 2004, the park was officially reopened by Charlie Dimmock and the Mayor of Hastings after a large regeneration scheme costing \u00a33.46m.
