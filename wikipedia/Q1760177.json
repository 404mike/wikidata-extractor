To make matters worse, his old friend and fixer, Mateen (Stephen Lobo) has been hired away by Luke's journalistic nemesis, Imran Sahar (Vik Sahay).

In the end, he realises that the rumour about Canadians mutilating fingers is a lie and that his people still have some morality in this war torn land. Just as he is about to leave, He and Sgt. Rick (a Canadian soldier who is the leader of the squad with whom he had been travelling) come under fire from a Taliban sniper, but the Taliban runs out of bullets and walks off, while Luke thinks he killed him.
