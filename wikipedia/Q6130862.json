Sir George Scharf (1820\u20131895), artist and art historian, first Director and later trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, later drew a sketch of this engraving, which was based on this portrait. George Perfect Harding drew a pencil, watercolour and bodycolour copy of the portrait in 1811. Bodycolour is watercolour which is mixed with white pigment to make it opaque."]}, {"page": "John Collett (artist)", "response": ["James Caldwall engraved The Gipsies, The Ladies' Disaster, The Bold Attempt, The Unwelcome Customer, The Guards of the Night defeated, A Macaroni taking his Morning Ride in Hyde Park, The Englishman in Paris, High Life below Stairs, The Cotillion Dancers, exhibited in 1772."]}, {"page": "Caldwall, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Caldwall"]}]}}
