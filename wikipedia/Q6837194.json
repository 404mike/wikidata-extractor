Instead of being composed of sheets of paper, it used sheets of vellum, papyrus, or other materials.  The term codex is often used for ancient manuscript books, with handwritten contents.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.: Codex: \"a manuscript volume\" A codex, much like the modern book, is bound by stacking the pages and securing one set of edges in a form analogous to modern bookbinding by a variety of methods over the centuries.  Modern books are divided into paperback or softback and those bound with stiff boards, called hardbacks.  Elaborate historical bindings are called treasure bindings.Michelle P.

The outlines of the story are told in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, though the annals represent a West Saxon point of view.Dumville, David N., Simon Keynes, and Susan Irvine, eds. The Anglo-Saxon chronicle: a collaborative edition. MS E. Vol. 7. Ds Brewer, 2004. On the day of Egbert's succession to the kingdom of Wessex, in 802, a Mercian ealdorman from the province of the Hwicce had crossed the border at Kempsford, with the intention of mounting a raid into northern Wiltshire; the Mercian force was met by the local ealdorman, \"and the people of Wiltshire had the victory\".Swanton, Michael (1996). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. New York: Routledge. . In 829, Egbert went on, the chronicler reports, to conquer \"the kingdom of the Mercians and everything south of the Humber\".Whitelock, Dorothy, ed. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1965. It was at this point that the chronicler chooses to attach Egbert's name to Bede's list of seven overlords, adding that \"he was the eighth king who was Bretwalda\".Bede, Saint. The Ecclesiastical History of the English People: The Greater Chronicle; Bede's Letter to Egbert. Oxford University Press, 1994. Simon Keynes suggests Egbert's foundation of a 'bipartite' kingdom is crucial as it stretched across southern England, and it created a working alliance between the West Saxon dynasty and the rulers of the Mercians.Keynes, Simon. \"Mercia and Wessex in the ninth century.\" Mercia. An Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe, ed. Michelle P. Brown/Carol Ann Farr (London 2001) (2001): 310\u2013328. In 860, the eastern and western parts of the southern kingdom were united by agreement between the surviving sons of King \u00c6thelwulf, though the union was not maintained without some opposition from within the dynasty; and in the late 870s King Alfred gained the submission of the Mercians under their ruler \u00c6thelred, who in other circumstances might have been styled a king, but who under the Alfredian regime was regarded as the 'ealdorman' of his people."]}, {"page": "Book of Cerne", "response": ["Recent research of this manuscript by Michelle P. Brown suggests that the various Anglo-Saxon component sections of this book are conceptually inter-related and primarily associated with the doctrine of the Communion of Saints (\"communio sanctorum\").Brown 1991, p. 211; Brown 1996, pp.147-151; Walker 2000, p. 193. This doctrine is found in the Ninth Article of the Apostles' Creed (\"Symbolum Apostolorum\") and is based on the spiritual union between each Christian, living and dead, and Christ, and between each other Christian, which ultimately derives its origins in the \"vita apostolica\" and the inter-relationships or fellowship of the Early Christian congregations. This doctrine is found in the Anglo-Saxon Creed dating to the 9th century. However, in addition to the doctrine of the Communion of Saints, other themes are embedded in the texts and images that include a penitential and Paschal element that emphasizes baptism and communion (Eucharist), as well as notions of forgiveness and salvation.Brown 1996, p. 151.", "Brown, Michelle P. \u201cMercian Manuscripts?

And then Beornred succeeded to the kingdom, and held it a little while and unhappily; and that same year Offa put Beornred to flight and succeeded to the kingdom, and held it 39 years...\" According to Ingulf, an 11th-century Benedictine abbot, Beornred was regarded as a tyrant, while Roger of Wendover, a thirteenth-century chronicler, states that he was an unjust king and that the people of Mercia rose in rebellion against him. He was possibly involved in his predecessor's death. According to Professor Michelle P. Brown, Beornred has been considered by some historians to have been part of the same dynasty as Beorhtric of Wessex, as well as several other prominent Anglo-Saxon nobles whose names begin with the letter B."]}, {"page": "Drollery", "response": ["*Michelle P.

The actual bookbinding technique is the same as for other medieval books, with the folios, normally of vellum, stitched together and bound to wooden cover boards.  The metal furnishings of the treasure binding are then fixed, normally by tacks, onto these boards.  Treasure bindings appear to have existed from at least Late Antiquity, though there are no surviving examples from so early, and Early Medieval examples are very rare.  They were less used by the end of the Middle Ages, but a few continued to be produced in the West even up to the present day, and many more in areas where Eastern Orthodoxy predominated.  The bindings were mainly used on grand illuminated manuscripts, especially gospel books designed for the altar and use in church services, rather than study in the library.Michelle P.

However, they also drew on the Insular tradition, especially for decorative detail, whilst greatly improving on that in terms of the depiction of the human figure. Copies of the scriptures or liturgical books illustrated on vellum and adorned with precious metals were produced in abbeys and nunneries across Western Europe.
