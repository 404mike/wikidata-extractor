Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East in the early days of the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.", "Nolan then became a staff officer, joining the staff of General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, as an aide-de-camp in January 1849. He quickly became close friends with Berkeley's two sons, Charles and George, who were also enthusiastic about horse-racing. In 1850 Nolan accompanied Berkeley on a tour of the region, conducting horse trials to evaluate the use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was also promoted, purchasing a Captaincy on 8 March. Despite these successes, Nolan recognised that his prospects were far more limited in India than in England, and he could not afford the increased costs of serving in the colonies. At the same time, service in India was not taken seriously by many of the officers in high command, and would not be sufficient on its own to advance him. Accordingly, he obtained two years sick leave on 16 January 1851 and returned to England, intending to tour Europe and write a book on cavalry theory."]}, {"page": "Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Sir George Berkeley ||rowspan=\"2\"|Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*General Sir George Berkeley (1785\u20131857)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir George Berkeley||Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of Lord High Commissioners of the Ionian Islands", "response": ["| Sir George Berkeley(1785\u20131857)Acting (for absent Mackenzie to 17 February 1843)"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["*Sir George Berkeley, 1852: 67"]}, {"page": "Duchess of Richmond's ball", "response": ["* Sir George Berkeley, K.C.B., and Lady Berkeley"]}, {"page": "George Berkeley (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Berkeley (1685\u20131753) was an Irish philosopher and Anglican bishop.", "George Berkeley or Berkley may also refer to:", "* George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley (1601\u20131658), English nobleman", "* George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley (1628\u20131698), English aristocrat", "* George Berkeley (died 1746) (after 1680\u20131746), British Member of Parliament", "* Sir George Berkeley (British Army officer) (1785\u20131857), British soldier and Conservative politician", "* Sir George Berkeley (civil servant) (1819\u20131905), British colonial administrator", "* George Berkeley (cricketer) (1870\u20131955), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "George Cranfield Berkeley", "response": ["#  Sir George Berkeley was a general and father of the 7th Earl of Berkeley.
