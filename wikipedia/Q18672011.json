He was a member of the London Missionary Society (now, the Council for World Mission) and volunteered with the organisation in 1855. Three years later, he went to Southern Africa and began his missionary work at Kuruman (where David Livingstone had earlier served), at that time in the northern part of Cape Colony. He thereafter continued that work among the Tswana people of what later became the Bechuanaland Protectorate. He became disturbed by encroachments into Tswana territory by Boers (Dutch-speaking European settlers) from the Republic of Transvaal. From 1867, he publicly urged that the United Kingdom adopt the Tswana territories as a protectorate, arguing that British rule would safeguard the rights of the Africans against the racism of the Boers. In 1884, the UK government established the protectorate of British Bechuanaland, and appointed Mackenzie its deputy commissioner. In 1885, he was replaced in that post by Cecil Rhodes, but retained considerable political influence. That same year, he took part in the Warren Expedition, one result of which was that British Bechuanaland was enlarged to the north to become the Bechuanaland Protectorate (modern Botswana). In 1889, he retired from public life and resumed his missionary activities.He died on 23 March 1899 at Kimberley, Cape Colony.John Mackenzie School, Francistown, Botswana was founded in 1899 as Francistown European School; in 1958, it was renamed in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Khama III", "response": ["Despite his considerable influence as an economic actor, Khama is best known as the founder of a Christian state.

The brothers were some of the first members of the tribe to take this step; a step that would soon be joined by a fairly large percentage of Khama's followers. It was no small step for Khama. By this time in his life he had already gone through bogwera (the tribe's traditional initiation ceremony into manhood) with members of his mephato (age regiment). Historically, bogwera entailed rigorous endurance tests, which included circumcision.", "The British government itself was of two minds as to what to do with the territory. One faction, supported by a local missionary named John Mackenzie, advocated the establishment of a protectorate, while another faction, headed by Cecil Rhodes, adopted a more assertive stance and demanded that the country be opened up to European settlement and economic exploitation. The resolution came in 1885, when the territory south of the Molopo River became the colony of British Bechuanaland, while the territory north of the river became the Bechuanaland Protectorate. The colony was eventually incorporated into Britain's Cape Colony and is now part of South Africa."]}, {"page": "Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead", "response": ["John Mackenzie and later Cecil Rhodes were sent to secure the peaceful submission of the Boers, but without immediate result, partly owing to the attitude of the Cape ministry. Robinson's declaration that the advice of his ministers to patch up a settlement with the filibustering Boers was equivalent to a condonation of crime, led to the expedition of Major General Sir Charles Warren and the annexation of Bechuanaland early in 1885. He repeatedly argued for the Bechuanaland Protectorate to be extended north, beyond 22\u00b0.
