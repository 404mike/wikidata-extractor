Hyatt left his comfortable family home and struck out around the world c. 1896. He arrived in Africa to seek his fortune during 1898. In his written works, Hyatt describes his life and experiences in Australia, Rhodesia and the Philippines. He wrote fluently and skilfully about life on \"The Road\", and about his fellow-riders and his animals. Hyatt had a bitter contempt for commercially inspired progress, vehemently defending the \"underdog\" whenever he could, and was a savage critic of The Establishment. The Old Transport Road and The Diary of a Soldier of Fortune are his famous works.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hyatt (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Stanley Portal Hyatt, British explorer and writer"]}, {"page": "List of Old Alleynians", "response": ["*Stanley Portal Hyatt (1877\u20131914) 1885\u201392 #3817 African explorer and war correspondent"]}]}}
