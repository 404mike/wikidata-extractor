He was a supporter of the Manningham Mills Strike, and this led him to promote the idea of Liberal-Labour candidates.  However, the Liberal Party was not receptive to the idea of standing working men in elections.  In 1891, Tattersall was a founder of both the Halifax Labour Electoral Association (LEA), and the Halifax Fabian Society. In January 1892 he stood in the Halifax School Board election as an LEA candidate, alongside Albert Thornton.  The two topped the poll, winning seats on the board, and this inspired the LEA to found the new Halifax Labour Union, with Tattersall as its president.  While he remained on the Liberal Executive until later in the year, he was now strongly opposed to the party, and at the 1892 UK general election, he chaired a meeting in support of Alfred Arnold, the Conservative candidate.Patricia A.
