Anholt's picture books are notable for their upbeat and humorous approach to important issues for young children, often based on his own family experience and typified by a quirky, hand drawn pen and watercolour style. In recent years, Anholt has turned to writing for an older age range, including The Hypnotist a novel for a Young Adult readership published by Penguin Random House, about race and civil rights set in the Deep South of America in the early 1960s. The novel was officially endorsed by Amnesty International. In July 2019, Anholt's first title in the Mindful Detective series featuring Buddhist cop, Vincent Caine, Art of Death was published by Constable / Little, Brown. Laurence Anholt lives in Devon, Southwest England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evil Queen", "response": ["*Snow White and the Seven Aliens: In this children's book by Laurence Anholt, the jealous Mean Queen is a former famous pop star who was the lead singer of The Wonderful Wicked Witches."]}, {"page": "Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize", "response": ["* 0\u20135 years: Chimp and Zee by Catherine and Laurence Anholt (Frances Lincoln)", "* 6\u20138 years: Snow White and the Seven Aliens by Laurence Anholt, illus.
