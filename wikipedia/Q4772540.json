They were together until Forwood's death in 1988. Bogarde repeatedly denied that his relationship to Forwood was anything other than platonic. This was probably untruthful, given that male homosexual acts were criminal during most of his career, and could lead to prosecution and imprisonment. Rank Studio contracts included morality clauses, which provided for termination in the event of \"immoral conduct\" on the part of the actor. These included same-sex relationships, thus potentially putting the actor's career in jeopardy.Kressler, Noah B. \"Using the Morals Clause in Talent Agreements: A Historical, Legal, and Practical Guide.\" Columbia Journal of Law & the Arts, Vol. 29, 13 December 2005.

In 1960, Bogarde was 39 and just about the most popular actor in British films. He had spent fourteen years being cast as a matin\u00e9e idol by The Rank Organisation. He had proven himself playing war heroes (The Sea Shall Not Have Them; Ill Met by Moonlight); he was the star of the hugely successful Doctor film series; and he was a reliable romantic lead in films like A Tale of Two Cities. He was flirting with a larger, Hollywood career by playing Liszt in Song Without End. British audiences had named him their favourite British film star for years. Bogarde was suspected to be homosexual, lived in the same house as his business manager, Anthony Forwood, and was compelled to be seen occasionally in public with attractive young women. He seems not to have hesitated to accept the role of Farr, a married lawyer with a homosexual past that he has not quite put behind him. Bogarde himself wrote the scene in which Farr admits to his wife that he is gay and has continued to be attracted to other men despite his earlier assurances to the contrary. In his first independent film project in his 34th film, he said in 1965, \"For the first time I was playing my own age. At Rank, the fixed rule was that I had to look pretty. Victim ended all that nonsense.\" He wrote years later in his autobiography that his father had suggested he do The Mayor of Casterbridge, \"But I did Victim instead, ... playing the barrister with the loving wife, a loyal housekeeper, devoted secretary and the Secret Passion. It was the wisest decision I ever made in my cinematic life. It is extraordinary, in this over-permissive age [c. 1988], to believe that this modest film could ever have been considered courageous, daring or dangerous to make. It was, in its time, all three.\""]}, {"page": "1988 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 18 || Anthony Forwood || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 72 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Gareth", "response": ["* In the film Knights of the Round Table (1953), he was played by Anthony Forwood."]}, {"page": "The Story of Robin Hood (film)", "response": ["* Anthony Forwood as Will Scarlet"]}, {"page": "Traveller's Joy", "response": ["*Anthony Forwood as Nick Rafferty"]}, {"page": "Knights of the Round Table (film)", "response": ["* Anthony Forwood as Gareth "]}, {"page": "List of films and television series featuring Robin Hood", "response": ["*1952: The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men, a feature from Walt Disney, starring Richard Todd as Robin, Joan Rice as Marian, Peter Finch as the Sheriff of Nottingham, James Hayter as Friar Tuck, James Robertson Justice as Little John, Hubert Gregg as Prince John, Elton Hayes as Alan-a-Dale, Anthony Forwood as Will Scarlet, as Patrick Barr as King Richard.
