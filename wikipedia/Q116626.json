Roaf is a British archaeologist specialising in ancient Iranian studies and Assyriology.  \nRoaf studied the archaeology of Western Asia at University College of London, and wrote his doctoral thesis, Sculptures and Sculptors at Persepolis (published 1983) at the University of Oxford. From 1981 to 1985 he was the director of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. He also taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and is currently Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Munich. \nRoaf has conducted fieldwork in Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Bahrain. In Iran he dug at Tepe Nush-i Jan under the direction of David Stronach, with whom he wrote Nush-i Jan I. The Major Buildings of the Median Settlement. With the Munich University team, he has recently worked on the archaeological expeditions at Gircano and Ziyaret Tepe, ancient Tushhan, Turkey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Persepolis", "response": ["One bas-relief from Persepolis is in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England.A Persepolis Relief in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

For a time they also controlled the Assyrian territories of the upper Tigris and its headwaters at Nineveh, Erbil, Assur and Nuzi. Their allies included Kizuwatna in southeastern Anatolia; Mukish, which stretched between Ugarit and Quatna west of the Orontes to the sea; and the Niya, which controlled the east bank of the Orontes from Alalah down through Aleppo, Ebla and Hama to Qatna and Kadesh. To the east, they had good relations with the Kassites.Michael Roaf, Cambridge Atlas of Mesopotamia, maps, pp. 134\u2013135. The land of Mitanni in northern Syria extended from the Taurus mountains to its west and as far east as Nuzi (modern Kirkuk) and the river Tigris in the east. In the south, it extended from Aleppo across (Nuhasse) to Mari on the Euphrates in the east. Its centre was in the Khabur River valley, with two capitals: Taite and Washukanni, called Taidu and Ussukana respectively in Assyrian sources. Washukanni was located in Tell Fekheriye as recent German archaeological excavations suggest. The whole area supported agriculture without artificial irrigation and cattle, sheep and goats were raised. It is very similar to Assyria in climate, and was settled by both indigenous Hurrian and Amoritic-speaking (Amurru) populations."]}, {"page": "Fitzwilliam Museum", "response": ["Richard Nicholls and Michael Roaf"]}, {"page": "Tat people (Caucasus)", "response": ["Archaeological material uncovered in present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia include Achaemenid architecture, jewelry and ceramics.

The expedition resulted in the discovery of 6,896 pieces of flint, mainly in the form of scrapers. Evidence was also obtained from the site that showed that the sea level of Bahrain during the late Neolithic era was much higher than present-day levels by as much as 4\u00a0m with some speculating that Al Markh was itself an islet. Potteries found on the site were dated to 3,800 BC.
