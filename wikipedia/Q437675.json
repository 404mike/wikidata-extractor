She applied 19th-century archaeological discoveries to the interpretation of ancient Greek religion in ways that have become standard. She has also been credited with being the first woman to obtain a post in England as a \u2018career academic\u2019. Harrison argued for women's suffrage but thought she would never want to vote herself.

Hesiod's pithos refers to a large storage jar, often half-buried in the ground, used for wine, oil or grain.Cf. Verdenius, p.\u00a064. It can also refer to a funerary jar.Cf. Harrison, Jane Ellen, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, Chapter II, The Pithoigia, pp.\u00a042\u201343. Cf. also Figure 7 which shows an ancient Greek vase painting in the University of Jena where Hermes is presiding over a body in a pithos buried in the ground. \"In the vase painting in fig.7 from a lekythos in the University Museum of Jena we see a Pithoigia of quite other and solemn intent. A large pithos is sunk deep into the ground. It has served as a grave. ... The vase-painting in fig. 7 must not be regarded as an actual conscious representation of the Athenian rite performed on the first day of the Anthesteria. It is more general in content; it is in fact simply a representation of ideas familiar to every Greek, that the pithos was a grave-jar, that from such grave-jars souls escaped and to them necessarily returned, and that Hermes was Psychopompos, Evoker and Revoker of souls. The vase-painting is in fact only another form of the scene so often represented on Athenian white lekythoi, in which the souls flutter round the grave-stele. The grave-jar is but the earlier form of sepulture; the little winged figures, the Keres, are identical in both classes of vase-painting.\" Erasmus, however, translated pithos into the Latin word pyxis, meaning \"box\".According to West 1978, p. 168, Erasmus \"probably\" confused the story of Pandora with the story found elsewhere of a box which was opened by Psyche; the Panofskys (1956) follow him in this surmise. The phrase \"Pandora's box\" has endured ever since.", "Jane Ellen HarrisonHarrison, Prolegomena 1922, pp 280\u201383. also turned to the repertory of vase-painters to shed light on aspects of myth that were left unaddressed or disguised in literature. On a fifth-century amphora in the Ashmolean Museum (her fig.71) the half-figure of Pandora emerges from the ground, her arms upraised in the epiphany gesture, to greet Epimetheus. A winged ker with a fillet hovers overhead: \"Pandora rises from the earth; she is the Earth, giver of all gifts,\" Harrison observes. Over time this \"all-giving\" goddess somehow devolved into an \"all-gifted\" mortal woman. A.H. Smith,Smith, \"The Making of Pandora\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies 11 (1890, pp.\u00a0278\u2013283), p 283. however, noted that in Hesiod's account Athena and the Seasons brought wreaths of grass and spring flowers to Pandora, indicating that Hesiod was conscious of Pandora's original \"all-giving\" function. For Harrison, therefore, Hesiod's story provides \"evidence of a shift from matriarchy to patriarchy in Greek culture. As the life-bringing goddess Pandora is eclipsed, the death-bringing human Pandora arises.\"William E. Phipps, \"Eve and Pandora contrasted\" Theology Today 45 on-line text  Thus, Harrison concludes \"in the patriarchal mythology of Hesiod her great figure is strangely changed and diminished. She is no longer Earth-Born, but the creature, the handiwork of Olympian Zeus.\" (Harrison 1922:284).

Rose wrote that the myth of Pandora is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic in that it makes Pandora the origin of all of Man's woes with her being the exemplification of the bad wife.Cf. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Literature; From Homer to the Age of Lucian, Chapter III, Hesiod and the Hesiodic Schools, p.\u00a061. \"Its attitude towards women is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic; a good wife is indeed the best prize a man can win (702), but a bad one is the greatest curse; generally speaking women are a snare and a temptation (373\u20135) and Pandora was the origin of all our woes\"."]}, {"page": "Titans", "response": ["Some 19th- and 20th-century scholars, including Jane Ellen Harrison, have argued that an initiatory or shamanic ritual underlies the myth of the dismemberment and cannibalism of Dionysus by the Titans.Harrison, p. 490.

Following him and Jane Ellen Harrison, several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable.Wesel, Uwe, Der Mythos vom Matriarchat. \u00dcber Bachofens Mutterrecht und die Stellung von Frauen in fr\u00fchen Gesellschaften (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1980). The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan.Morgan, L., Ancient Society Or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization. Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. The notion of a \"woman-centered\" society was developed by Bachofen, whose three-volume Myth, Religion, and Mother Right (1861) impacted the way classicists such as Harrison, Arthur Evans, Walter Burkert, and James MellaartRuether, Rosemary Radford, Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History, p.\u00a015. looked at the evidence of matriarchal religion in pre-Hellenic societies.Bachofen, Johann Jakob, Myth, Religion, and Mother Right.

This interpretation reached the height of its popularity during the early twentieth century, and many of its most prominent early proponents, such as James George Frazer and Jane Ellen Harrison, were classical scholars.

Burkert confirmed that an impetus for his book had come from Konrad Lorenz, On Aggression, \"which seemed to offer new insight into the disquieting manifestations of violence.\" The book argues that solidarity was achieved among the Greeks through a sacred crime with due reparations: \"for the strange prominence of animal slaughter in ancient religion this still seems to be the most economical, and most humane explanation\" (p. xv). Its first chapter \"Sacrifice as an Act of Killing\" offers conclusions that are supported in the ensuing chapters through individual inquiries into myth, festival and ritual, in which the role of poetic creation and re-creation are set aside \"in order to confront the power and effect of tradition as fully as possible\".
