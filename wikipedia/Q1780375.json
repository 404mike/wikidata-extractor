Since the 1980s, he has written many reference books about the Beatles and has worked for EMI, MPL Communications and Apple Corps. He has been referred to as the world's leading authority on the band due to his meticulous research and integrity. His works include The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions (1988), a history of the group's session dates, and The Beatles: All These Years (2013\u2013present), a three-volume series intended as the group's most comprehensive biography.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Lennon", "response": ["In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him.

In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her. According to author Mark Lewisohn, however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate.

Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place patronised by a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best had been the only group member to study O-Level German at school, he could converse with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed following complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.", "Epstein negotiated ownership of the Decca audition tape, which was then transferred to an acetate disc, to promote the band to other record companies in London. In the meantime, Epstein negotiated the release of the Beatles from their recording contract with Bert Kaempfert and Polydor Records in Germany, which expired on 22 June 1962.Tune In by Mark Lewisohn The record producer at EMI, George Martin, met with Epstein on 9 May 1962 at the Abbey Road studios, and was impressed with his enthusiasm. He agreed to sign the Beatles on a recording contract, based on listening to the Decca audition tape, without having met them or having seen them perform live. As a part of this contract, the Beatles recorded at Polydor's Studio Rahlstedt on 24 May 1962 in Hamburg as a sessions band, backing Tony Sheridan. thumb|left|270px|alt=Studio Two, Abbey Road Studios|Studio Two of Abbey Road Studios (in 2008) where Pete Best recorded with the Beatles in a test session on 6 June 1962", "In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies opined that the firing of Best was \"one of the few murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done.\" Over twenty years later, Mark Lewisohn concluded that \"Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete ... The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now \u2013 as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured \u2013 he was out. It was the most underhanded, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power.\"", "Explaining why Geoff Britton, one-time drummer in his subsequent band Wings, 'didn't last long' in that group, McCartney said: 'It's like in the Beatles, we had Pete Best.  He was a really good drummer, but there just was something, he wasn't quite like the rest of us, we had like a sense of humour in common and he was nearly in with it all, but it's a fine line, you know, as to what is exactly in and what is nearly in. So he left the band and we were looking for someone who would fit.'Wingspan DVD 2001 56:30) He told Mark Lewisohn, similarly, that when George Martin suggested 'changing' their drummer, the Beatles responded: 'Well, we're quite happy with him, he works great in the clubs', but also that 'Pete had never quite been like the rest of us. We were the wacky trio and Pete was perhaps a little more sensible; he was slightly different from us, he wasn't quite as artsy as we were.'Mark-Lewisohn-The-Complete-Beatles-Recording-Sessions-1988-pdf"]}, {"page": "Ringo Starr", "response": ["Tjinder Singh of the indie rock band Cornershop has highlighted Starr as a pioneering drummer, adding: \"There was a time when the common consensus was that Ringo couldn't play.

Starr influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of Classic Rock Drummers: \"Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers.\""]}, {"page": "The Beatles", "response": ["Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg.

Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life\u00a0... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\""]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["The series gained large audiences and won a BAFTA as Best Comedy Series in 1984.

In author Mark Lewisohn's description, it was a \"curious\" session, but one that demonstrated the Beatles' \"tremendous appetite for recording\". During the Sgt. Pepper sessions, the band also recorded \"Carnival of Light\", a McCartney-led experimental piece created for the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave, held at the Roundhouse Theatre on 28 January and 4 February.

This performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: \"I don't know how they do it. We've been recording all day but the longer we go on the better they get.\" Mark Lewisohn later wrote: \"There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music\". Paul McCartney double-tracked his vocal on \"A Taste of Honey\" and Lennon added harmonica onto \"There's a Place\" during these sessions.

And I think also John and I wanted to do something bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop.\" Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn cites the band's dedication to achieving a discordant twanging sound for Harrison's lead guitar part, and Martin's objection to the song opening with this sound, as an example of the Beatles breaking free of their producer's control for the first time. To achieve the desired swelling effect, Lennon knelt on the studio floor and altered the volume control on Harrison's Gretsch as he played."]}, {"page": "Help!", "response": ["According to Mark Lewisohn and Alan W.
