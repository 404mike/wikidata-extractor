It appears that her portraits of children and dogs were popular based on her submitted works to the RHA, exhibiting without a break from 1900 to 1921. The Hugh Lane Gallery holds her portrait of Lord Ashbourne, which demonstrates her painting style of loose brush strokes with an air of informality. Yeats suggested that she spend some time in the United States, where he was living at the time. She spent two months in New York, staying with cousins at White Plains and then moved into a room neighbouring that of Yeats in Petitpas.
