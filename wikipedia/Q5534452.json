It was chaired by the Recorder of Portsmouth, John Scott Henderson, QC. The inquiry ran for one week and its findings upheld Evans's guilt in both murders with the explanation that Christie's confessions of murdering Beryl Evans were unreliable because they were made in the context of supporting his defence that he was insane. The conclusion was met with scepticism by the press and the public alike: if Christie's confessions were unreliable, why should those of Evans be acceptable? The inquiry ignored vital evidence and led to more questions in Parliament, especially from Geoffrey Bing, Reginald Paget, Sydney Silverman, Michael Foot and many other MPs. The controversy was to continue until it led eventually to the exculpation of Evans and a declaration of his innocence of the murder of both his wife and his daughter."]}, {"page": "1977 in Ireland", "response": ["* 24 April \u2013 Geoffrey Bing, lawyer and Labour politician in UK (born 1909)."]}, {"page": "1909 in Ireland", "response": ["* 24 July \u2013 Geoffrey Bing, lawyer and Labour politician in UK (died 1977 in Northern Ireland)."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Geoffrey Bing"]}, {"page": "Hornchurch (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Geoffrey Bing"]}, {"page": "John Christie (serial killer)", "response": ["Following Christie's conviction, there was substantial controversy concerning the earlier trial of Timothy Evans, who had been convicted mainly on the evidence of Christie, who lived in the same property in which Evans had allegedly carried out his crimes.See for instance Marston's summary of barrister Geoffrey Bing's criticism of the trial, p. 100: \"Bing pointed out that Evans's guilt depended on two incredible coincidences. The first was that two murderers, living in the same house but acting independently, strangled women... The second was as extraordinary as the first: that Evans accused the one man in London who was strangling women in the identical way that he, Evans, had strangled his wife and child.\" Christie confessed to Beryl's murder and although he neither confessed to, nor was charged with, Geraldine's murder, he was widely considered guilty of both murders at the time.Eddowes, John The Two Killers of Rillington Place, pp. xiv\u2013xviii details the pervasiveness of the view that Evans was innocent and the subsequent campaign undertaken to overturn his conviction. This, in turn, cast doubt on the fairness of Evans's trial and raised the possibility that an innocent person had been hanged."]}, {"page": "Reap the whirlwind", "response": ["* Reap the Whirlwind, a 1968 memoir by Geoffrey Bing"]}, {"page": "Rockport School", "response": ["The school was founded in 1906  by Geoffrey Bing of Rossall School and Keble College, Oxford, with the original aim to \"prepare boys for the Public Schools and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth\".

He was already under investigation by the Party's National Executive Committee and was expelled from the Labour Party in April 1948 after he submitted a statement which was found unacceptable. Officially, the Labour Party had given its support to the rival, non-communist aligned, Socialist Unity alliance. His expulsion led to the formation in 1949 of the Labour Independent Group which gained support from four other Soviet-sympathising ex-Labour MPs: Konni Zilliacus, D. N. Pritt, Geoffrey Bing and William Warbey. Platts-Mills stood as an Independent Labour candidate in the new Shoreditch and Finsbury constituency in the 1950 general election but only came third.
