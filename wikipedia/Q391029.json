She joined the Cabinet of the council as the Cabinet Member for Communications. Six months later, she was promoted to Cabinet Member for Finance. Six months after taking over the finance portfolio, she was elected as Leader of the Council, after serving just one year as Councillor.She stepped down from Hart Council in 2004 after being selected as parliamentary candidate for the South Ribble constituency in north-west England.She first contested the seat at the 2005 general election, when she came second to the incumbent MP, David Borrow. She contested the seat again in the 2010 general election when she defeated David Borrow with an 8.1% swing from the Labour Party to the Conservative Party, and regained the seat for the Conservative Party after 13 years.In 2013 she announced that she would not contend the next election and would be standing down after just one term.\nFullbrook was nominated for a life peerage by Boris Johnson in the 2019 Dissolution Honours List.

From the 1997 \"landslide year\" until 2010, David Borrow's vote total and majority consistently shrunk with a swing back to the Conservatives at every election. In terms of the other parties, Liberal Democrats have not thus far achieved better than third and 2005 saw UKIP nominating a candidate for the first time, and taking just over 1,200 votes.
