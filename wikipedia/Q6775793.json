In December 1989 Third Division club Preston North End tabled a bid of \u00a3125,000 which Norwich accepted enabling Flynn to return to his native north-west of England. His time at Preston was, however, a difficult one for although his performances were generally good the club were struggling with some of their better players being sold to boost the club coffers. In his time at Deepdale they sold Tony Ellis, Warren Joyce, Alan Kelly, Martin James, Brian Mooney and Mark Patterson. It therefore came as no surprise when Flynn himself was sold to Stockport County in March 1993 for a fee of \u00a3125,000. In Flynn's three-and-a-half years at Preston he had played 162 games scoring eight goals."]}, {"page": "Martin James", "response": ["Martin James may refer to:", "* Martin James (footballer) (born 1971), English former professional football player", "* Martin James (cricketer) (born 1963), former English cricketer"]}]}}
