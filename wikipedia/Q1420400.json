Many Victorian intellectuals, who had been raised in Christian households, had, in their adult life, begun to experience religious doubt and were moving in secular directions.  Creighton, in contrast, was slowly solidifying his religious beliefs.  While his high church views had moderated somewhat, he never had any crisis of confidence.  He had no interest in the new natural sciences, and was unmoved to read Darwin, regarding his writings as too much speculation.  Creighton's friend Henry Scott Holland wrote of him, \"At the close of the [1860s], it seemed to us at Oxford almost incredible that a young don of any intellectual reputation for modernity should be on the Christian side.\"  After some speculation by friends whether Creighton would commit to taking holy orders, he was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Oxford in 1870.

After further study, and guidance from the Oxford theologians Henry Scott Holland and Burnett Hillman Streeter, Temple felt ready to try again and in March 1908 he obtained an interview with his father's successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson. After an exchange of letters between Davidson and Paget, the Archbishop made Temple a deacon on 20 December 1908 in Canterbury Cathedral, and ordained him priest on 19 December 1909."]}, {"page": "Ledbury", "response": ["* Henry Scott Holland, professor of divinity."]}, {"page": "Sebastian Shaw (actor)", "response": ["Shaw died of natural causes on 23 December 1994 at age 89 in Brighton, Sussex, England.
