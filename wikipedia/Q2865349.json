He was widely rated as competing with W. G. Grace for the accolade of best batsman of the 1880s; Grace himself, when asked whom he would most like in his side, replied simply, \"Give me Arthur\". An opening batsman, Shrewsbury played his cricket for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and played 23 Test matches for England, captaining them in 7 games, with a record of won 5, lost 2. He was the last professional to be England captain until Len Hutton was chosen in 1952. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1890. He also organised the first British Isles rugby tour to Australasia in 1888.\nAn expert on sticky wickets, Shrewsbury topped the first-class batting averages seven times including in 1902, his final season. The following spring, incorrectly believing he had an incurable disease, he shot himself at his sister's home in Gedling, Nottinghamshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 11", "response": ["*1856 \u2013 Arthur Shrewsbury, English cricketer and rugby player (d. 1903)"]}, {"page": "British & Irish Lions", "response": ["In 1888, the promoter of the first expedition to Australia and New Zealand, Arthur Shrewsbury, demanded \"something that would be good material and yet take them by storm out here\". The result was a jersey in thick red, white and blue hoops, worn above white shorts and dark socks. The tours to South Africa in 1891 and 1896 retained the red, white and blue theme but this time as red and white hooped jerseys and dark blue shorts and socks. The 1899 trip to Australia saw a reversion to red, white and blue jerseys, but with the blue used in thick hoops and the red and white in thin bands. The shorts remained blue, as did the socks although a white flash was added to the latter. The one-off test in 1999 between England and Australia that was played to commemorate Australia's first test against Reverend Matthew Mullineux's British side saw England wear an updated version of this jersey. In 1903, the South Africa tour followed on from the 1896 tour, with red and white hooped jerseys. The slight differences were that the red hoops were slightly thicker than the white (the opposite was true in 1896), and the white flash on the socks introduced in 1899 was partially retained. The Australia tour of 1904 saw exactly the same kit as in 1899. In 1908, with the Scottish and Irish unions not taking part, the Anglo-Welsh side sported red jerseys with a thick white band  on tour to Australia and New Zealand. Blue shorts were retained, but the socks were for the first time red, with a white flash.", "| Alfred Shaw Arthur Shrewsbury"]}, {"page": "May 19", "response": ["*1903 \u2013 Arthur Shrewsbury, English cricketer (b. 1856)"]}, {"page": "W.

In addition, his \"ample girth\" had developed for he weighed 15\u00a0stone (95\u00a0kg) in his early twenties.Midwinter, p.31. Grace was a non-smoker but he enjoyed good food and wine; many years later, when discussing the overheads incurred during Lord Sheffield's profitless tour of Australia in 1891\u201392, Arthur Shrewsbury commented: \"I told you what wine would be drunk by the amateurs; Grace himself would drink enough to swim a ship.\"Birley, p.148.", "In the 1880s, Gloucestershire declined following its heady success in the 1870s. One of the reasons was the early death of W. G.'s younger brother Fred from pneumonia in 1880, there being a view that \"the county was never quite the same without him\".Birley, p. 132. Apart from W. G. himself, the only players of Fred Grace's calibre at this time were the leading professionals. Unlike the south-east and northern counties, Gloucestershire had neither the large home gates nor the necessary funds that could have secured the services of good quality professionals. This was at a time when a new generation of professionals was appearing with the likes of Billy Gunn, Maurice Read and Arthur Shrewsbury. As a result, Gloucestershire fell away in county competition and could no longer match Nottinghamshire, Surrey and Lancashire who had the strongest sides in the 1880s."]}, {"page": "Shrewsbury (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Arthur Shrewsbury (1856\u20131903), English cricketer", "*Arthur Shrewsbury (cricketer, born 1874), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1887 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Arthur Shrewsbury 721 @ 48.06 (HS 236)"]}, {"page": "1889 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Nine Great Batsmen of the Year \u2013 Bobby Abel, Billy Barnes, Billy Gunn, Louis Hall, Robert Henderson, Maurice Read, Arthur Shrewsbury, Frank Sugg, Albert Ward "]}, {"page": "Leg before wicket", "response": ["In essence, the lbw law remained the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery was not an easy one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.Brodribb, p. 243."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket records", "response": ["|  Arthur Shrewsbury || 23 January 1902|| 15 years, 162 days"]}, {"page": "Amateur sports", "response": ["On English overseas tours, some of which in the 19th century were arranged and led by professional cricketer-promoters such as James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury, a more pragmatic approach generally prevailed."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Bobby Abel,  Billy Barnes,  Billy Gunn,  Louis Hall,  Robert Henderson,  Maurice Read,  Arthur Shrewsbury,  Frank Sugg,  Albert Ward"]}, {"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The formal creation of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club was enacted in March or April 1841 (the exact date has been lost).

It was Clarke's successor as Nottinghamshire captain, George Parr, who first captained a united England touring team in 1859.  The club elected its first president, Sir Henry Bromley, in 1869. Early professional greats such as Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury ensured that Notts were a force in the period before 1900. Thanks largely to the outstanding bowling combination of Tom Wass and Albert Hallam, the county won the County Championship in 1907 when George Gunn, John Gunn and Wilfred Payton were also prominent."]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["International cricket began in 1877 when the England men's team played in the first-ever Test match. England have played more Test matches, and had more captains, than any other team. In the 19th century, the captains for overseas tours were chosen by the promoters. The early tours were mostly organised by professionals, especially James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. Some amateur-led tours went abroad under Lord Harris and Lord Hawke. Home captains were selected by the home ground authority, who often favoured a local player. For over 73 years, commencing with the 1903\u201304 tour of Australia and ending with the Centenary Test in 1977, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) organised international tours and selected the England team. On these tours, the team was called MCC in non-international matches and England in the internationals. MCC established a tradition of having amateur, rather than professional, captains. After Shrewsbury in 1886\u201387, there wasn't another professional captain until Len Hutton in 1952. The amateur/professional distinction was abolished in 1962, though some former amateurs captained England after that. In 1971, Ray Illingworth captained England in their first ODI. In 1977, management of the England team was taken over by the former Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) until 1 January 1997, and from then by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).

He was one of the organisers of Arthur Shrewsbury's team to Australia in 1884\u201385 but, in spite of his experience, the Australian captain Billy Murdoch refused to allow him to umpire the first ever Test match at Adelaide. However, along with Ted Elliott, he umpired in the second Test of that series, when the entire Australian team refused to play unless they received fifty per cent of gate takings. Nine new faces appeared for Australia, and were soundly beaten.

He also organised the first British Isles rugby tour to Australasia in 1888.", "Shaw helped fellow cricketers Andrew Stoddart and Arthur Shrewsbury to organise what became recognised as the first British Lions rugby union tour of Australia and New Zealand 1888/89.
