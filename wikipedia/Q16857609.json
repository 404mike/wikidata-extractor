She was involved in charity work throughout her life, operating a school and orphanage until her marriage to John Fletcher. She and a friend, Sarah Crosby, began preaching and leading meetings at her orphanage and became the most popular female preachers of their time.

Ryan's work at The Cedars was highly praised by John Wesley, the co-founder of Methodism.", "Sarah Ryan was quite close with another Methodist, Mary Bosanquet Fletcher. Ryan shared her experiences of working at John Wesley's Kingswood School with Bosanquet, and in March of 1763, the pair sought to establish a similar orphanage/school. They did so at 'The Cedars,' one of the Bosanquet family's properties in Leytonstone. Ryan and Bosanquet hired a maid to assist them. They also took in Ryan's orphaned niece, Sarah \"Sally\" Lawrence. As they took in more residents, Ryan's health began to decline. For more assistance, they hired Ann Tripp as a governess.

He would often be in Fletcher's study, or be looking through many of the books in his library. In 1814, John Kingston published a biography of John William Fletcher. This biography was 231 pages long and contained recollections from Fletcher's widow and large extracts from accounts of Fletcher's life as given by John Wesley, Joseph Benson, Joshua Gilpin, and Henry Venn (Clapham Sect).

Her parents Elizabeth and Thomas Leigh were Non-Conformists who attended Wesleyan services, and she joined the Wesleyan Methodist Church at sixteen. By this point the Wesleyan Methodists had long been supporting the effort to promote the marriages of male missionaries living in non-white communities around the world, and the letters from missionary wives abroad were regularly read at church meetings. The Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society begun in 1813 together with the interdenominational British and Foreign Bible Society (founded in 1804) connected the religious fervor of evangelism with the teaching of reason, happiness and civilisation. When Rev. William White (1794-1875), a Methodist missionary from New Zealand, visited a nearby village to preach and recruit a wife, Eliza took up the challenge. She told Rev. White and his companion, Rev. Thomas Buddle that she had been influenced by a minister's wife \"the niece of the celebrated Fletcher of Madeley, and one of the most noted women of John Wesley's time.\" Her role model, Mary Bosanquet Fletcher was a popular preaching Methodist woman in Shropshire, and her example of Methodism carried her through a life of active charity work, visitation among the most needy and schoolteaching. She and Reverend White were married on 30 June 1829 in Bluntisham, Huntingdonshire."]}]}}
