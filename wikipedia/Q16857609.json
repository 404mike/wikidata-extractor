She was born into an affluent family, but after converting to Methodism, rejected her luxurious lifestyle. Bosanquet was involved in charity work throughout her life, operating a school and orphanage until her marriage to John Fletcher. She and her friend Sarah Crosby began preaching and leading class meetings at her orphanage and would become the most popular female preachers of their time. Bosanquet was known as a \"Mother in Israel\", a Methodist term of honour, for her work in spreading the denomination across England.", "link_mentions": {}}}
