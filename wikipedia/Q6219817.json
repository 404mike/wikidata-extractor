He performed in Gilbert and Sullivan productions later in London but did not begin his professional performing career in earnest until 1967, when he joined the D'Oyly Carte as a chorister and small role player.  In 1969, he took over the principal bass-baritone roles in the company's entire repertoire, and he continued to play them full-time until the company closed in 1982. \nAfter this, he sang roles with opera companies throughout Britain and with Canadian Opera; he appeared frequently in concerts, music hall, cabaret, and pantomime. In London's West End, he understudied and played the role of Firmin in The Phantom of the Opera and played the Pope in Which Witch. Ayldon was a guest artist with the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on its tour to California and toured with such Gilbert and Sullivan concert groups as \"The Magic of D'Oyly Carte\" and \"The Best of Gilbert & Sullivan\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Pirate King||Darrell Fancourt||Donald Adams||Donald Adams||John Ayldon||John Ayldon"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|The Mikado||Donald Adams||Donald Adams||John Ayldon||John Ayldon"]}, {"page": "Iolanthe", "response": ["|Mountararat||Donald Adams||Donald Adams||John Ayldon||John Ayldon"]}, {"page": "Ruddigore", "response": ["|Sir Roderic||Darrell Fancourt||Donald Adams||Donald Adams||John Ayldon||John Ayldon"]}, {"page": "H.M.S.
