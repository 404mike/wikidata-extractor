Those who pleaded for clemency for Casement included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was acquainted with Casement through the work of the Congo Reform Association, poet W. B. Yeats, and playwright George Bernard Shaw. Joseph Conrad could not forgive Casement, nor could Casement's longtime friend, the sculptor Herbert Ward, whose son Charles had been killed on the Western Front that January, and who would change the name of Casement's godson, who had been named after him. Members of the Casement family in Antrim contributed discreetly to the defence fund, although they had sons in the British Army and Navy. A United States Senate appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the British cabinet on the insistence of prosecutor F. E. Smith, an opponent of Irish independence.See Angus Mitchell, Roger Casement and the History Question, History Ireland, July August 2016, 24:4, pp. 34\u201337.", "*Arthur Conan Doyle used Casement as an inspiration for the character of Lord John Roxton in the 1912 novel, The Lost World."]}, {"page": "Rudyard Kipling", "response": ["The writing life in Naulakha was occasionally interrupted by visitors, including his father, who visited soon after his retirement in 1893, and the British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, who brought his golf clubs, stayed for two days, and gave Kipling an extended golf lesson.Mallet, Phillip (2003).

This frequently takes the form of a character who was shown to have died but is later revealed to have somehow survived.  This is a common practice in horror films, which may end with the death of a monster that goes on to appear in one or more sequels. The technique is so common in superhero comics that the term \"comic book death\" has been coined for it. An early example of this type of retcon is the return of Sherlock Holmes, whom writer Arthur Conan Doyle apparently killed off in \"The Final Problem\" in 1893, only to bring him back, in large part because of readers' responses, with \"The Empty House\" in 1903. Another example is the character Phil Coulson, who was killed off in the Marvel Studios film The Avengers (2012), but is later shown to have survived in the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."]}]}}
