His writing is closely tied to the New Apocalypse, the New Romantics, and the Scottish Renaissance.\nScott was born in Glasgow, Scotland. During World War II he served in the British Army in Britain and Nigeria. After the war he received an M.A. with Honours in English Literature and a PhD from the University of Edinburgh. His first poems were published in 1941. Scott received an Atlantic Award for Literature in 1950 and traveled in France, Italy, and Sicily. During his travels he became interested in literature in Scots, his own native language, which shaped the direction of his work for the rest of his life.\nHe settled in Edinburgh and in 1953 married Heather Fretwell. He died on 6 June 1995 at the age of 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Tom Scott (1918\u20131995, S)"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Tom Scott (1918\u20131995), Scottish poet"]}, {"page": "Sorley MacLean", "response": ["Although his poetry had a profound impact on the Gaelic-speaking world, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that MacLean's work became accessible in English translation. His poetry was not very accessible to Gaelic speakers either, since D\u00e0in do Eimhir was not reprinted. To English-speakers, MacLean remained virtually unknown until 1970, when issue 34 of Lines Review was dedicated to his work and some of his poems were reproduced in the anthology Four Points of the Saltire. In the preface to the collection, Tom Scott forcefully argued for the merit of MacLean's poetry. Iain Crichton Smith published an English translation of D\u00e0in do Eimhir in 1971. MacLean was part of the delegation that represented Scotland at the first Cambridge Poetry Festival in 1975, establishing his reputation in England. He was one of five Gaelic poets to be anthologized in the influential 1976 collection Nua-Bh\u00e0rdachd Gh\u00e0idhlig / Modern Scottish Gaelic Poems with verse translations by the authors. MacLean's verse translations were also included in later publications."]}, {"page": "George Mackay Brown", "response": ["During this period he met many of the Scottish poets of his time \u2013 Sydney Goodsir Smith, Norman MacCaig, Hugh MacDiarmid, Tom Scott and others \u2013 with whom he often drank in Rose Street, Edinburgh.George Mackay Brown, p. 122.
