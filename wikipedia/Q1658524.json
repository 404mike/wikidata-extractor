In addition to being a member, albeit sometimes briefly, of some of the seminal bands of the 1960s, Waller played as a session musician with a host of UK and US artists and was famously known for never having a full drum kit whenever he turned up for recording sessions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeff Beck", "response": ["Beck was fired during a US tour for being a consistent no-show\u2014as well as difficulties caused by his perfectionism and explosive temper.

It sold well (reaching No. 15 on the Billboard charts). Beck-Ola saw drummer Micky Waller replaced by Tony Newman, and, while well-received, was less successful both commercially and critically.
