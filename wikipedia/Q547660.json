Adams donated the entire proceeds to leukemia research at a presentation at British Columbia Children's Hospital. In June 1989, teams up with famed producer/composer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange at London's Olympic Studios to write more material for the upcoming LP. Bryan attended a press conference on 8 June to launch the North American release of Rainbow Warriors, and also joined artists to re-record the classic Deep Purple hit \"Smoke On The Water\" in aid of Armenian earthquake victims.

Co-produced by Adams and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, it topped the charts around the world, including in the UK, Canada, Australia and Germany and reached number 6 on the Billboard 200. It became Adams's second album to be certified Diamond in sales in Canada while being certified 4x platinum in the US. It went on to sell 16 million copies worldwide. Waking up the Neighbors became the first album after Neil Young's 1972 Harvest to reach the top of the album charts in the United Kingdom. Ironically, however, the album was launched in Canada amidst a storm of controversy. The album is also known to have caused controversy in Canada due to the Canadian Content system. This indicated that a certain percentage must be broadcast by Canadian music on Canadian radio and television broadcasts. Since Waking Up the Neighbors was largely recorded in England and co-produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange (originally from Zambia), the album and its songs, under the rules in effect until 1991, were not thoughtful purely Canadian productions. Meanwhile, the album was shortly broadcast in Canada, but nevertheless managed to reach the top of the Canadian charts. Following Bryan Adams' complaints, in September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced that the Canadian content rules would be expanded. The old regulation for collaborative writing between Canadians and non-Canadians where the lyricist and musical composer worked separately. In September 1991, the regulation was optimized to recognize unions in which two (or more) contributors each contributed to both lyrics and music, as was the case with Adams and Lange. In protest, Adams briefly threatened to boycott Canada's annual Juno Awards, where his album had been almost completely ignored by the awards committee. He did end up winning the Juno International Achievement Award, Canadian Entertainer of the Year (voted on by the public) and Producer of the Year Award.", "In the 1990s, with the release of Waking Up the Neighbours in 1991, produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, they left the hard rock sound and released an album closer to classic rock and roll, taking inspiration from the sounds of bands and artists such as Def Leppard and Foreigner. This album is based on these tones, which brings out a leap in notoriety and also in musical quality to the Canadian rocker, placing itself right in the middle between the sounds of and those of \"18 Til 'I Die\". Without forgetting that just after \"Wakin 'up the Neighbors\" will come the best So Far So Good, assisted by this album, which churns out some of the singles that Adams fans. In 1996, with his album 18 til I Die, Adams and Lange adopted a pop rock sound more in line with the style of the time. Many ballads were included in this work, although it also contained some rock songs such as \"18 til I Die\" and \"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\". The album sees the collaboration of the American singer and songwriter Gretchen Peters, still active today. In 1998, On a Day Like Today was released, co-produced by his compatriot Bob Rock, he opted for a sound oriented to pop rock, heavily influenced by contemporary bands."]}, {"page": "Grammy Award for Record of the Year", "response": ["| Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, producer", "| Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, producer; Jeff Balding & Mike Shipley, engineers/mixers"]}, {"page": "Appetite for Destruction", "response": ["The band initially considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted.
