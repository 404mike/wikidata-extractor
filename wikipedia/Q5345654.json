D. Tuddenham FMedSci is considered one of the world's leading haematologists having authored over 200 papers in the field. He gained his Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery at the University of London in 1968 and his Membership of the Royal College of Physicians in 1975. Up until 2005 was head of the Haemostasis and Thrombosis Research (Medical Research Council) Group at Imperial College. Professor Tuddenham is a pioneer in the field of haemophilia and was responsible, along with Frances Rotblat, for the purification and cloning of the factor VIII gene, which led to the highly effective and safe treatments available to haemophilia sufferers today. In more recent years, he has been actively involved in developing gene therapy for haemophilia. The first successful use of gene transfer to convert severe to mild haemophilia B was reported by his group in December 2011.He retired from Directorship of the Katharine Dormandy Centre in July 2011 and is now Emeritus Professor of Haemophilia at University College London. He continues to work in the Haemophilia Centre at the Royal Free Hospital on gene therapy clinical trials, with the goal of curing all forms of haemophilia.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Factor VIII", "response": ["Factor VIII  was first discovered in 1937, but it was not until 1979 that its purification by Edward Tuddenham, Frances Rotblat and coworkers led to the molecular identification of the protein.", "* Edward Tuddenham"]}, {"page": "Professor Ted Tuddenham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Tuddenham"]}, {"page": "Ted Tuddenham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Tuddenham"]}, {"page": "Frances Rotblat", "response": ["In 1979, Rotblat began work with Edward Tuddenham at the Royal Free Hospital in North London to isolate and stabilise the so-called Factor 8, a protein which haemophiliacs had a shortage of, leading to their blood not clotting. They extracted Factor 8 from cryoprecipitate, a plasma protein that was used at the time to inhibit bleeding, and after several stages of chemistry, used diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a nerve gas, to prevent enzymes from destroying the Factor 8. Rotblat and Tuddenham's innovation was to inject mice with the Factor 8 to cause the development of antibodies, which then were extracted from the mouse spleen, and concentrated into a pure sample of Factor 8. This was sent to Genentech, an American biotechnology company, for DNA sequencing, which was completed in 1984."]}]}}
