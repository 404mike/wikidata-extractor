Roberts' The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus of 1947, reprinted at least seven times during the next forty years, which contained both transcriptions and translations, with brief commentaries. This was followed in 1961 (reprinted in 1982) by Edgar Leoni's Nostradamus and His Prophecies. After that came Erika Cheetham's The Prophecies of Nostradamus, incorporating a reprint of the posthumous 1568 edition, which was reprinted, revised and republished several times from 1973 onwards, latterly as The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus. This served as the basis for the documentary The Man Who Saw Tomorrow and both did indeed mention possible generalised future attacks on New York (via nuclear weapons), though not specifically on the World Trade Center or on any particular date.See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus, Futura, 1990, p. 373"]}, {"page": "Cheetham (surname)", "response": ["*Erika Cheetham (1939\u20131998), English medieval scholar"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 1998", "response": ["*Erika Cheetham, 58, English writer."]}]}}
