He is notable for being the last serious exponent of underarm or lob bowling to appear regularly in first-class cricket.\nEducated at Malvern College and Clare College, Cambridge, he played for Cambridge University (1895\u201397) and Worcestershire (1899\u20131914) where he was captain from 1911 to 1912. He played regularly throughout his cricketing career for which he was rewarded, aged 34, by being selected to play for the England national cricket team. He played throughout the five-Test series (1909\u20131910) in South Africa on matting pitches taking the first of his 23 wickets with his fifth ball. He bowled brisk off-breaks along a low trajectory with a leg-break action.\nHe was a Cambridge Blue at both cricket and football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Underarm bowling", "response": ["George Simpson-Hayward was an England hero of the 1909\u201310 series in South Africa with his underarm bowling.

He bowled with a much lower trajectory than most earlier lob bowlers, imparting great spin to the ball with constant variation of pace as well."]}, {"page": "Delivery (cricket)", "response": ["Underarm or lob bowling was the original cricket delivery style, but had largely died out before the 20th century, although it was used until 1910 by George Simpson-Hayward, and remained a legal delivery type. On 1 February 1981, when Australia was playing New Zealand in a One Day International cricket match, and New Zealand needed six runs to tie the match from the final ball. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain, ordered the bowler (his brother Trevor) to bowl underarm, rolling the ball along the ground to prevent the Number 10 New Zealand batsman (Brian McKechnie) any chance of hitting a six from the last ball to tie the match."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["George Simpson-Hayward \u00b7"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket (1816\u20131863)", "response": ["The controversy surrounding roundarm bowling came to a head before the 1827 season began and three trial matches were played between Sussex and an England XI. No firm conclusions were drawn in the immediate aftermath of the trials and it was many years before roundarm was formally legalised, but in practice roundarm was adopted in 1827 as its practitioners, especially William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge of Sussex, continued to use it with little, if any, opposition from umpires. Roundarm's supporters claimed that their campaign was a \"march of intellect\".
