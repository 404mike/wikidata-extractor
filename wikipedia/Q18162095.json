This new division had been formed with the merging of the clubs in the bottom half of the Third Division South with those in the bottom half of the Third Division North. Palace had failed to qualify for the new Third Division, falling outside the top twelve finish required by two places. Palace's first season in the Fourth Division saw them finish seventh, with the club faring slightly worse the following season with an eighth place finish. Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager Arthur Rowe in April 1960 and the club then enjoyed a successful 1960\u201361 season, finishing second behind league newcomers Peterborough United, who thus matched Palace's 1920\u201321 achievement of winning a championship in their inaugural league season. Palace also set Fourth Division records for the highest average attendance of 19,092, and the highest attendance at an individual match; 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park against Millwall. Surrey-born Johnny Byrne scored 31 of Palace's 110 goals that season, and his strike partner Roy Summersby contributed 25 as the club moved up to the Third Division.Matthews, p.\u00a079\u201380, 87\u201390"]}, {"page": "List of Crystal Palace F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Roy Summersby||||FW||1958\u20131963||190||60||||"]}, {"page": "Roy Summersby (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roy Summersby"]}, {"page": "2016 in association football", "response": ["* 7 August: Roy Summersby, English footballer (born 1935)"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Roy Summersby, 81, footballer (Crystal Palace, Millwall, Portsmouth)."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 in English football", "response": ["* 7 August 2016: Roy Summersby, 81, Millwall, Crystal Palace and Portsmouth inside forward.Crystal Palace F.C. on Twitter"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2016", "response": ["*Roy Summersby, 81, English footballer (Crystal Palace, Millwall, Portsmouth).Sad passing of former Lions striker"]}, {"page": "Summersby", "response": ["*Roy Summersby (1935\u20132016), English footballer"]}]}}
