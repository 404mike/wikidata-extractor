He was a laboratory technician and was employed in the Meteorological Office. \nHe served as a councillor on Easthampstead Rural District Council from 1962.\nEllis contested Wokingham in 1964. He was Member of Parliament for Bristol North West from 1966 to 1970 (when he lost the seat), and then for Brigg and Scunthorpe from 1974 to 1979, when he lost to the Conservative Michael Brown by 486 votes (0.7%). Ivor Crewe, Director of the British Election Study, attributed his defeat to the intervention of a Democratic Labour Party candidate, who polled over 2,000 votes, and thus \"splintered  enough of the Labour vote\" to allow the Conservatives narrowly win the seat.Ellis was an assistant government whip from 1974 to 1976. He also served as a member of the Commons Expenditure Committee.He died in Scunthorpe in May 2019 at the age of 88.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Ellis"]}, {"page": "John Ellis", "response": ["John Ellis may refer to:", "*John Ellis (scrivener) (1698\u20131791), English political writer", "*John Ellis (naturalist) (1710\u20131776), English botanical illustrator", "*John Ellis (physicist) (born 1946), British theoretical physicist", "*R.
