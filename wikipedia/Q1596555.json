His wife and former pupil at Reading, Annie Ure (1893\u20131976), was the museum's first Curator from 1922 until her death. The Ures were experts on Greek and Egyptian antiquities, and particularly Greek ceramics. With Ronald M. Burrows, they undertook important excavations at Rhitsona in Boeotia, Greece.\nPercy has been described as \"an inveterate picker-up of fragments\" which he acquired wherever he could, including from children or discarded under bushes at archaeological sites like Rhitsona or Mycenae. Many were packed in the boxes of Percy's favourite cigarettes. He also accepted a donation of \"battered\" items from the British Museum. Percy collected plain and functional items neglected by other scholars, believing that they might be as informative as more attractive pieces.Together the Ures enjoyed a passion for Greek ceramics and Boeotian pottery in particular. They wrote several important books on finds at Rhitsona as well as over fifty articles on Greek pottery. In 1954 they produced an important volume in the international series, Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, which covered about half of the current Ure Museum collection.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
