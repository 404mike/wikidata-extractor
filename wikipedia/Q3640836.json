While some critics accused Heaney of being \"an apologist and a mythologiser\" of the violence, Blake Morrison suggests the poet has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance... Yet he has also shown signs of deeply resenting this role, defending the right of poets to be private and apolitical, and questioning the extent to which poetry, however \"committed\", can influence the course of history."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["*Blake Morrison"]}, {"page": "Alan Bennett", "response": ["Bennett was made an Honorary Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1987.
