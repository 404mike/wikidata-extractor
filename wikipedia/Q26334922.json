Educated at Eton College, Henry inherited the baronetcy on the death of his father in July 1806.In the October 1812 general election Sullivan, a supporter of the ruling Tory party, was simultaneously elected Member of Parliament (MP) for both Rye and Lincoln. Standing down as MP for Rye after a by-election in December 1812, Sullivan continued to represent Lincoln until his death in April 1814. Since he was a serving soldier, he played little part in Parliamentary business.
