It was only when a number of suffragists, despairing of change through peaceful means, decided to turn to militant protest that the \"suffragette\" was born. These women broke the law in pursuit of their aims, and many were imprisoned at Holloway for their criminal activity. They were not treated as political prisoners, the authorities arguing they were imprisoned for their vandalism, not their opinions. In protest, some went on hunger strike and were force fed so Holloway has a large symbolic role in the history of women's rights in the UK for those in sympathy with the movement. Suffragettes imprisoned there include Emmeline Pankhurst, Emily Davison, Violet Mary Doudney, Katie Edith Gliddon, Isabella Potbury, Evaline Hilda Burkitt, Georgina Fanny Cheffins, Constance Bryer, Florence Tunks, Janie Terrero, Doreen Allen, Bertha Ryland, Katharine Gatty, Charlotte Despard, Janet Boyd, Genie Sheppard, Mary Ann Aldham, Mary Richardson, Muriel and Arabella Scott, Alice Maud Shipley, Katherine Douglas Smith, Dora Montefiore, Christabel Pankhurst, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Emily Townsend, Leonora Tyson, Ethel Smyth and the American Alice Paul. Detainees later received the Holloway brooch. In 1912 the anthem of the suffragettes - \"The March of the Women\", composed by Ethel Smyth with lyrics by Cicely Hamilton - was performed there."]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["* Katherine Douglas Smith (1878\u2013) \u2013 militant suffragette and WSPU organiser"]}, {"page": "Katherine Smith", "response": ["*Katherine Douglas Smith (1878\u2013?), British suffragette"]}, {"page": "Suffragette", "response": ["* Katherine Douglas Smith"]}, {"page": "Catherine Douglas (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Katherine Douglas Smith (1878\u2013?), militant British suffragette"]}, {"page": "Eagle House (suffragette's rest)", "response": ["* Katherine Douglas Smith planted a mountain Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii 'Glauca' ) on February 18, 1910 ."]}, {"page": "Maud Joachim", "response": ["In an imaginative protest organised with Katherine Douglas Smith Joachim held up traffic in the West End by the two riding black bay horses up the Strand, at the same time advertising a suffragette meeting at the Royal Albert Hall.

The following year she was employed by the WSPU to organise their activities in Liverpool taking over from Mary Phillips. Flatman arranged humble lodgings for Constance Lytton when she came to Liverpool disguised as a working woman, aiming to get arrested for suffragette activism to created suitable publicity. In July 1910, Flatman was a key speaker at one of the platforms in the 10,000 women's rally at Hyde Park.as "]}]}}
