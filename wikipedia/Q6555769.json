He was credited with eight confirmed aerial victories, comprising one enemy aircraft captured, one destroyed, one \"forced to land\" and five \"driven down\". Rees and his gunner, Flight Sergeant James McKinley Hargreaves, were the only two airmen to become aces flying the earliest purpose-built British fighter aeroplane, the Vickers Gunbus.Rees also had a keen interest in archaeology. While flying from Cairo to Baghdad in the 1920s, he took some of the earliest archaeological aerial photographs of sites in eastern Transjordan (now Jordan), and published several articles in Antiquity and the journal of the Palestine Exploration Fund. He is considered a father of the archaeological studies of this remote area, and a pioneer of aerial archaeology. He was also an accomplished sailor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "No. 11 Squadron RAF", "response": ["No. 11 Squadron numbered 19 flying aces in its ranks during the war.

Although its forward-firing machine gun was a great advantage, the fighter did not have the speed or rate of climb to pursue its quarry; thus, the F.B.5's performance proved to be inadequate for its intended role. This can be illustrated by noting that only the single pilot/observer team of Lionel Rees and James McKinley Hargreaves became aces while flying this type.Gutmann and Dempsey 2009, pp. 90\u201391."]}, {"page": "1955 in Wales", "response": ["*28 September \u2013 Lionel Rees, airman, Victoria Cross recipient, 71"]}, {"page": "Lionel Wilmot Brabazon Rees", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lionel Rees"]}, {"page": "1955 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*28 September \u2013 Lionel Rees, Welsh airman, Victoria Cross recipient (born 1883)"]}, {"page": "1884 in Wales", "response": ["*31 July \u2013 Lionel Rees, aviator, recipient of the Victoria Cross (died 1955)"]}, {"page": "Frederick Libby", "response": ["Libby claimed five victories while teamed with Captain (later Major) Stephen Price; one of the victories was shared with Lionel Rees.
