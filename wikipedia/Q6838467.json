As a player, he started his career as an apprentice with Nottingham Forest and played non-league football for several clubs including Kettering Town and Matlock Town. He later became manager of the reserve team at Ilkeston Town before being appointed first-team manager in 1971 following the departure of Dave Agnew. Six months later, Walker was hired as manager of the Singapore national football team. He joined Burton Albion as manager in 1976 and spent two years in charge of the club, later joining the coaching staff at Notts County.\nWalker had a spell as manager of Notts County, succeeding Neil Warnock in January 1993. He was fired in September 1994.

Their first game of that season was a visit to Manchester United at Old Trafford, where they lost 2\u20130. However, they did manage to hold Manchester United to a 1\u20131 draw in the return game at Meadow Lane just after the turn of the year, as United began a dismal second half of the season which ultimately cost them the league title. County's relegation came shortly after the sale of strikers Paul Rideout and Tommy Johnson, which raked in nearly \u00a32million in total and contributed towards a \u00a35million stadium revamp which saw Meadow Lane rebuilt on three sides shortly afterwards. With the introduction of the Premier League, County were relegated from the old Division One to the new Division One. Warnock was dismissed in January 1993 and was succeeded by Mick Walker.

By the time he made his Football League debut, starting in a 1\u20130 win at home to Coventry City on 11 April, County were well on the way to relegation. By his second and last appearance of the season, second-tier football for 1992\u201393 was confirmed. The following season, he was gradually eased into the first team: his first league appearance was as a substitute on 26 September, he made his first league start three days later, and he was more or less a first-team regular for the next couple of months, by which time County were firmly established in the relegation places. After Warnock was replaced by Mick Walker in January 1993, Devlin returned to the starting eleven and remained in it to the end of the season. He scored his first Football League goal in a 3\u20133 draw away to Grimsby Town on 27 February, and scored twice more to help the team retain their second-tier status with a 17th-place finish."]}, {"page": "Russell Slade", "response": ["Slade was assistant manager to Mick Walker at Notts County, and took over as caretaker manager when Walker was sacked in September 1994.
