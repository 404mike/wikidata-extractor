Johnson's victory was beyond dispute, for he was much superior than Harvey, who hardly won a solitary round, and was nearly always out-scored. Harvey had a shade the better of the early rounds, more so the first and sixth, though Johnson appeared to be hitting the harder of the two, which was rather surprising as Johnson had failed to show that he had possessed a really good punch in the majority of his previous contests. From the seventh, Johnson began to wear Harvey down with good two-handed punches both to the body and the face. Harvey was never idle, and continually got home home straight and accurate lefts, but his right was not so much evident as usual. The punishment Harvey took sapped his strength and his face bore evidence of the hard punching Johnson. Johnson was practically unmarked at the close of the contest when referee Sam Russell announced the victor. He was the clear winner on points, and exposed Harvey's offensive and defensive weaknesses. After the fight, many felt Johnson had substantiated his claim to a meeting with Tommy Milligan.", "On 2 January 1931, The Leicester Evening Mail exclusively announced that Larry Gains had a scheduled meeting with Sam Russell of the National Sporting Club, with a view of removing the colour bar in British boxing, to which Gains stated, \"[...] It will mean that Johnson will be able to fight Harry Crossley for the Londsale cruiserweight belt [...] You can guess what the lifting of the ban would mean to me.\" As of 5 February, the National Sporting Club had scrapped the rule prohibiting coloured boxers on their programmes, and it was hoped that some amends would be made to Johnson. On 25 February, The Western Morning News announced that Johnson had signed up for three matches in Manchester, with the Belle Vue Syndicate proposing to match him with Harry Crossley and Len Harvey, light-heavyweight and middleweight champions, respectively. On 27 March, Northampton Chronicle & Echo reported that Johnson would appear at King's Hall, Manchester on 6 April, in a match at light-heavyweight against Jack Etienne, who was regarded as one of the best light-heavyweights in Europe. Leading up to the fight, Johnson was the major betting-line favourite, though on 6 April, Etienne narrowly outpointed him over fifteen-rounds at King's Hall, Manchester. Johnson was particularly keen to win the rubber-match with Etienne in view of the possibilities of a rematch with Len Harvey. Johnson started off well, and in the earlier rounds had a slight lead, but Etienne was always the stronger of the two. The Belgian fighter launched a fierce two-handed attack from the start and found frequent loopholes in Johnson's defence. During the post-fight interviews, Bill Johnson, father and manager of Len, remarked that his son had won the fight, in which he expanded: \"[...] the referee thought otherwise. That is all there is to that.

Johnson disregarded the Frenchman's left, and when they went into clinches Johnson hit heavily with both hands. After half a minute of fighting, Johnson, in a breakaway, got in a left and a right and then another left to the side of the body. Vermaut went down in agony, to be counted out. After knocking out Vermaut, on 27 April, it was announced that Johnson would rematch Len Harvey in a fifteen-round contest at the Royal Albert Hall on 11 May. Additionally, it was also revealed to be taking place under strict championship conditions at the middleweight poundage, and that the contest would be a championship affair, albeit won't be sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control, which does not allow coloured boxers to box for British titles.

In the interim of training for the Thil fight, future British heavyweight champion Jack London had accepted Johnson's offer to fight him. In preparation for Thil, Johnson was sparring Jim Stanley and Valenzo Pinca. At the weigh-in, Johnson scaled in at 163 and a half-pounds, whereas Thil came in lighter at 161 and a half-pounds. On 31 October, in front of a crowd of 25,000 at the Palais des Sports, Johnson was defeated by Thil via a referee-technical decision. After seven fierce rounds, Johnson was forced to give up. The gong sounded for the eighth-round, but Johnson rose from his corner and said that he was unable to continue. Of the seven rounds fought, Thil won five, and the other two were even rounds.
