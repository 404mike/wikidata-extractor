Around this time, drummer Tony Arthy departed from Jesus Jones. He added recorded EPs with Hunter in 2000, and joined the Wonder Stuff upon being asked. Hunt came across guitarist Dan Donnelly at the end of the 2000s while him and violinist Erica Nockalls were performing on their Never Ending Acoustic Tour. Donnelly audition for Hunt, and was promptly added to the line-up. Hint began writing material for the band's next album at his home, where he made demo recordings. Despite a fruitful January 2015, which saw the creation of five songs, for the next two months, Hunt struggled for more songs. He told Arthy about this, who then asked how the original line-up wrote their debut studio album The Eight Legged Groove Machine (1988), to which he replied by jamming in a rehearsal space. At Arthy's suggestion, all of the members met up in Stourbridge in May 2015 for a period of three days to come up with new songs.", "* Dan Donnelly \u2013 guitars, mandolin, backing vocals"]}]}}
