Beginning his career with Gillingham he moved to Sunderland in 2005 with whom he played in the Premier League. After two lengthy loan spells with Sheffield United he made a permanent switch to Watford in 2012 but was released in the summer of 2014 after a loan spell with Bristol City. Born in Brixton, South London, Nosworthy has represented Jamaica at international level, playing fourteen games and scoring once.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 11", "response": ["*1980 \u2013 Nyron Nosworthy, English-born Jamaican footballer"]}, {"page": "Brixton", "response": ["*Nyron Nosworthy, professional footballer."]}, {"page": "Stephen Wright (English footballer)", "response": ["With McCarthy dismissed towards the end of the 2005\u201306 season, new chairman and former teammate Niall Quinn agreed to take the reins, however, decided to leave Wright out of the opening games of the 2006\u201307 season, instead preferring midfielder Rory Delap for the role. Wright made his first appearance for 7 months in the 3\u20132 defeat to Plymouth on 12 August 2006, however, picked up another injury in the defeat to Bury two games later, and battled with Nyron Nosworthy and on-loan defender Danny Simpson to regain his position after resuming training with the first team."]}, {"page": "Dean Whitehead", "response": ["Ahead of the 2006\u201307 season, Reading had a bid of \u00a31.2\u00a0million for Whitehead rejected in July 2006. The following month, Whitehead and teammate Liam Lawrence both signed new contracts. He continued to establish himself in the first-team, under the management of newly appointed manager Roy Keane. Whitehead then scored his first goal of the season against West Bromwich Albion, in a 2\u20130 win during which he was named as man of the match. Then, on 21 October, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win against Barnsley. During the 2006\u201307 season, Whitehead resigned the captaincy to concentrate on his football but he deputised for the frequently injured Steven Caldwell and was reappointed as captain on a permanent basis after Caldwell was sold to Burnley. At one point during the 2006\u201307 season, Whitehead played in a right\u2013back position following the absence of Nyron Nosworthy. The following month, he reverted to his central midfield position. Towards the end of the season, Whitehead scored two more goals. Sunderland finished first in the Championship in 2006\u201307, thus making an instant return to the Premier League. At the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Whitehead was included in the PFA Team of the Year. He also came second in the club's Player of the Year vote. Despite being sidelined during the 2006\u201307 season, Whitehead went on to make forty\u2013seven appearances and scoring four times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Stanislav Varga", "response": ["His strong and powerful presence, ability in the air and no nonsense defending has made him a rising fan favourite at the Stadium of Light. Having to act as a substitute behind first choice centre half Nyron Nosworthy, the Slovak chose a one-month loan deal to Burnley on 4 January 2008 to regain match-fitness. He was named in the Championship Team of the Week for his performance in Burnley's 1\u20130 win over Plymouth Argyle, his first league game for the club."]}, {"page": "Neill Collins", "response": ["With Sunderland back in the Championship in 2006\u201307, Collins was forced to play in the unfamiliar role of right-back after injuries to teammates Stephen Wright and Nyron Nosworthy. He was a regular under Mick McCarthy, but when McCarthy left the job, Collins was dropped by replacement manager Roy Keane despite Collins feeling he'd performed well."]}, {"page": "Anton Ferdinand", "response": ["On 27 August 2008, Ferdinand signed for Sunderland for an undisclosed fee on a four-year deal. Sunderland manager Roy Keane also stated after the signing of Ferdinand that he viewed him as a future England International. Ferdinand made a promising start to his Sunderland career in a partnership formed with Danny Collins but Sunderland's poor results at the start of the 2008\u201309 season saw Keane experiment with several different back four line-ups resulting in Ferdinand being in and out of the side. Following captain Dean Whitehead's departure to Stoke City in July 2009, Nyron Nosworthy took Whitehead's vacated number 6 jersey and Ferdinand switched from number 26 to number 5. Ferdinand fell out of favour with new manager Steve Bruce and first team opportunities became limited and he was not initially given a squad number for the 2010\u201311 Premier League season as loan-signing John Mensah was given Ferdinand's number 5 shirt, but was later given number 29."]}, {"page": "Osei Sankofa", "response": ["In February 2012, Sankofa was involved in the \"Show Racism the Red Card\" campaign, along with Nyron Nosworthy, John Eustace, Graham Taylor and Paul Mortimer."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Sunderland A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Nyron Nosworthy"]}, {"page": "Richard Rose (footballer)", "response": ["Rose started to establish himself more in the 2004\u201305 season, during which time he played 20 times (18 in the league), mostly at right or left back. Gillingham were eventually relegated back down to League One at the end of that season. Relegation prompted the departures of Nyron Nosworthy (a right back) and John Hills (a left back), presenting Rose to stake a claim for a regular spot in the starting line-up in League One. Things certainly started according to plan as Neale Cooper gave Rose a permanent right-back spot. With Cooper's departure midway through the season, Rose was out of favour under new manager Ronnie Jepson and only made one more appearance for the first team.

Before the start of the season, McCarthy recruited Daryl Murphy, Nyron Nosworthy, Jonathan Stead, Kelvin Davis, Tommy Miller, Martin Woods, Alan Stubbs, Joe Murphy and Andy Gray. Their first match back in the Premier League came against Charlton Athletic where they were beaten 3\u20131. Sunderland's first victory of the season came in the Tees-Wear derby, when goals from Tommy Miller and Julio Arca saw them to a 2\u20130 victory.
