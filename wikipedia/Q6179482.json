Throughout her time, she is shown to have influenced many of the most significant individuals who shaped that century, both positively and negatively.\nIn terms of personality, Sparks is depicted as a superficial hedonist hiding a strong underlying sense of morality.\nShe was named the 44th Greatest Comic Book Character by Empire Magazine in 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of superheroines", "response": ["*Jenny Sparks (DC Comics - Wildstorm)"]}, {"page": "Stormwatch (comics)", "response": ["Ellis continued to write the book into Stormwatch volume 2, until the August 1998 WildC.A.T.s/Aliens crossover (also written by Ellis) which saw the Stormwatch team decimated by xenomorphs (the creatures from  the Alien film series).

Stormwatch volume 2 ended with a story, set after WildC.A.T.s/Aliens, in which the United Nations disbanded Stormwatch.

DC would order Adams' work on the final issues of the volume be substantially re-drawn, the more significant examples being a scene depicting leader of the G7 Authority, The Colonel, about to perform a sexual act on Jenny Sparks' severely-decomposed corpse that was re-drawn and Millar's dialogue was re-written to remove any depiction or mention of necrophilia; a panel in which G7 Authority member Teuton kills multiple people by flying through them, that was re-drawn as two separate and less graphic panels; multiple panels in which Teuton gropes Apollo against his will and is then killed in a particularly gory fashion, which were re-drawn so as not to show the groping and to make Teuton's death scene less explicit; a series of panels depicting Swift being humiliated, which had sexual overtones, and was re-drawn so as to soften the scene; and a panel in which George W.
