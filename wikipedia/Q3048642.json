Brenton became famous in the aftermath of the war, when he published the Naval History of Great Britain from the Year 1783 to 1822 in 1823. The book was popular, but Brenton was criticised at the time and since for his failure to distinguish between fact and rumour as well as his partisan political leanings. In Brenton's later life, he was heavily involved in charitable enterprises in the poorer areas of London with mixed success.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Camperdown", "response": ["Not all of the reactions were positive: several of Duncan's captains were criticised for their failure to rapidly and decisively engage the enemy, including Captain Wells of Lancaster.United Service Journal, p. 147 The worst criticism fell on Captain John Williamson of Agincourt. Agincourt had been barely engaged in the battle and had suffered not one single casualty. As a result, Williamson was accused of failing to do his duty by Captain Hopper of Agincourt's Royal Marines and court-martialled on 4 December 1797, at Sheerness aboard Circe, on the charges of \"disobedience to signals and not going into action\" and \"cowardice and disaffection\". Williamson had a history of indecisiveness: in 1779, while a junior officer on Captain James Cook's voyage to the Pacific Ocean, Williamson had prevaricated about bringing boats to evacuate Cook from Kealakekua Bay while under attack by Hawaiians. As a result, Cook was trapped on the beach and stabbed to death.Lloyd, p. 161 At the conclusion of the trial on 1 January 1798, Williamson was found guilty of the first charge and not guilty of the latter, resulting in demotion to the bottom of the post captains list and prohibition from further naval service. Williamson was reported to have died in 1799, shortly after his dismissal from the service,Clowes, p. 330 but Edward Pelham Brenton later claimed that he had instead gone into hiding under an assumed name and continued to draw his pension for many years. In the Batavian Republic, there were also recriminations against those officers who were deemed to have failed in their duty: De Winter's despatch from London after the battle placed much of the blame with six ships that had failed to follow his orders and had withdrawn early from the battle.James, p. 75 Several officers were brought up on charges, including Admiral Bloys van Treslong who was convicted at court-martial and dismissed the service although later reinstated, and Commander Souter of Batavier who was convicted and imprisoned. Admiral Story was also criticised, particularly by De Winter, and was only permitted to keep his command once he had satisfied the Batavian government that he had had no option but to retreat.", "Although Camperdown was considered the greatest ever victory for a British fleet over an equal enemy force to that date, historian Noel Mostert has noted that it \"was a battle that, with posterity, somehow lost rank and significance against the greater and more romantically glorious events that followed\". Nevertheless, the effects of the action on the wider war were hugely important. The losses suffered by the Dutch Navy in ships, men and morale gave the Royal Navy superiority in the North Sea, a position enhanced by the disruption the battle caused to French negotiations for an alliance with what historian Edward Pelham Brenton describes as the \"Northern Powers\" of Scandinavia. The destruction of the Dutch fleet at Camperdown was also a serious blow to French ambitions to invade Ireland, and denied their Atlantic fleet of essential reinforcements; it may even have played a part in Napoleon Bonaparte's decision to abandon efforts to attack Britain directly early in 1798.Mostert, p. 233 In 1799, a significant British and Russian expeditionary force landed in the Netherlands supported by a large fleet under Lord Duncan. Assailed from both sea and land, the remainder of the Dutch Navy under Admiral Story capitulated without a fight: in what became known as the Vlieter Incident, the political divisions between the officers and seamen resulted in a mutiny during which the Dutch sailors threw their ammunition overboard.James, p. 308 In Britain, the public relief at the restoration of the Navy's authority in the aftermath of the spring mutinies was enormous and helped steady the wavering British government in their pursuit of the war by restoring confidence in British naval supremacy in home waters. Christopher Lloyd notes that the events of 1797 led to \"a new and blatant patriotism ... [which] was centred on the achievements of 'our gallant tars'.\"Lloyd, p. 163 A popular rhyme of the time reflected public feeling:", "De Winter's actions during the battle have been commended: Edward Pelham Brenton wrote in 1836 that \"The Dutch admiral displayed, in his own person, the most undaunted valour ... but was compelled at length to yield to superior skill, it would be untrue to say superior bravery.\"Brenton, p. 348 while William James noted in 1827 that after the battle \"\"Batavian prowess\" still claimed the respect of an enemy and the applause of the world\". De Winter was released from captivity in 1798 after news reached Britain that his wife had suffered a stroke, and he subsequently became the Batavian ambassador to France, before resuming command of the Dutch fleet at the start of the Napoleonic Wars. He was a trusted subordinate of Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland between 1806 and 1810, and was honoured by Emperor Napoleon in 1811 before his sudden death in Paris the following year."]}, {"page": "Brenton", "response": ["*Edward Pelham Brenton (1774\u20131839), British officer of the Royal Navy"]}, {"page": "Jahleel Brenton", "response": ["Jahleel Brenton was born on 22 August 1770 in Rhode Island, British North America.Tracy, p. 51.

Brenton was the great-great grandson of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations governor William Brenton, who had emigrated from England in the 17th century, and the grandson of the longest serving governor in Rhode Island history, Samuel Cranston. He had two brothers that survived past infancy\u2014Edward Pelham Brenton and James Wallace Brenton\u2014and both served in the Royal Navy.Raikes, p. 36.", "Suffering from frequent attacks of gout, Brenton retired from his position at Greenwich Hospital in 1840. The assurances made to Brenton by the King had been overlooked after his death in 1837, but soon after his retirement Brenton's seniority on the Navy List was restored and he was duly promoted to vice admiral. He subsequently moved to Casterton and then to Elford where he wrote a memoir of his brother, Captain Edward Pelham Brenton. He eventually settled in Leamington Spa where in 1844 his health deteriorated and he died of \"general debility\" on 21 April. He was buried in New Street Cemetery, Leamington Spa.

Alexander was in a sinking condition, and it was only with difficulty that the ship was brought back to port afloat. The captured crew were distributed among the French squadron and as a result Bligh was unable to make a full casualty list. He later estimated losses of approximately 40 men killed or wounded aboard Alexander, although French accounts give 28 killed and 30 wounded. British histories reported French casualties in the engagement as the enormous figure of 450 men killed and wounded, although as French historian Charles Rouvier noted in 1868, this is an absurdly inflated total: Rouvier gave French losses as 10 wounded, all on Marat.Rouvier, p. 187 Bligh was returned to Brest in the custody of Captain Jean Fran\u00e7ois Renaudin, who had commanded the ship Vengeur du Peuple at the Glorious First of June until his ship was sunk. Bligh, who had, unknown to him, been promoted to rear-admiral whilst at sea, later commended Renaudin for his conduct while Bligh was a prisoner and wrote to the Admiralty that he had been treated with \"great Kindness and Humanity\".

Prominent among these rumours was the suggestion that Corbet had been murdered by his disaffected crew: historian William James wrote in 1827 that \"There are many who will insist, that Captain Corbett's [sic] death-wound was inflicted by one of his own people.\" although he goes on to point out the unlikelihood of Corbet being shot by one of his own cannon. He gives more credence to the story that Corbet committed suicide to avoid the shame of defeat, that he \"cut the bandages from his amputated limb, and suffered himself to bleed to death.\" This story was also alluded to in Edward Pelham Brenton's 1825 history: \"Corbet did not (we fear would not) survive his capture\". The truth of Corbet's end will never be known with certainty, although James ultimately concludes that Corbet's wound was almost certainly a mortal one and thus the most likely cause of death.James, p. 307"]}, {"page": "HMS Spartan (1806)", "response": ["In 1811, Brenton's brother Edward Pelham Brenton took command and operated off the American Eastern Seaboard during the War of 1812, attacking shipping off Cape Sable but otherwise having little success against American merchant ships."]}, {"page": "Invasion of Martinique (1809)", "response": ["| align= left  |Commander Edward Pelham Brenton"]}, {"page": "Action of 10 February 1809", "response": ["Officers from Latona were first to board the French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal surrender except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage.

Phaeton was sent ahead with despatches intended to warn Lord Bridport that the French fleet was at sea and inform him of Cornwallis's safety. However, Bridport had already sailed on 12 June with 15 ships of the line as a cover for a secondary force detailed to land a British and French Royalist army at Quiberon Bay, and the main British fleet was already off Brest when the action between Cornwallis and Villaret de Joyeuse was fought.James, p. 244 The ships of Cornwallis's squadron had all suffered damage, especially Triumph and Mars: Triumph had to have extensive repairs to its stern, which had been heavily cut away during the action. Historian Edward Pelham Brenton credits this action with influencing Robert Seppings in his future designs of ships of the line, providing rounded sterns that offered a wider field of fire at pursuing warships. Casualties were light however, with just 12 men wounded on Mars and no other losses on the remainder of the squadron."]}, {"page": "British anti-invasion preparations of 1803\u201305", "response": ["By the 1 September 1805, Napoleon's invasion camps were empty due to the Grande Arm\u00e9e marching against the Austrians.

A Military, Political and Social History of the British Army 1509\u20131970 (Cassell, 2000), p. 252. However, the threat of invasion remained so long as Britain was at war with France. At Tilsit in July 1807, Napoleon and the Russian Tsar Alexander I agreed to combine the navies of Europe against Britain. The British responded with a pre-emptive attack on the Danish fleet at Battle of Copenhagen, and they also made sure the French never secured the Portuguese fleet.Richard Glover, Britain at Bay. Defence against Bonaparte, 1803-14 (London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1973), pp. 17-18. Captain Edward Pelham Brenton in his Naval History of Great Britain noted that after Trafalgar \"another French navy, as if by magic sprang forth from the forests to the seashore, manned by a maritime conscription exactly similar in principle to that edict by which the trees were appropriated to the building of ships\".Glover, p. 19. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Melville, noted after the war that given time Napoleon would \"have sent forth such powerful fleets that our navy must eventually have been destroyed, since we could never have kept pace with him in building ships nor equipped numbers sufficient to cope with the tremendous power he could have brought against us\"."]}, {"page": "HMS Lark (1794)", "response": ["In April 1802 Edward Pelham Brenton took command.

What happened next has been subject to debate, with the second-in-command, Lieutenant John Edwards claiming that Courtenay had been killed and he was thrown overboard as was the custom at the time. However rumours subsequently circulated that Courtenay had only been knocked unconscious when Edwards gave the order to jettison him, a story that his family credited and was later taken up by the contemporary historian Edward Pelham Brenton, although historian William James subsequently defended Edwards' actions. With Courtenay gone, Boston continued to suffer severe damage until just after 07:00, when the remaining officers ordered all surviving sails set and the British ship attempted to escape. Although Bompart pursued, by 08:00 the strain had proved too much for his ship and he fell back. After a close encounter with French ships in the Delaware River, Boston eventually escaped to St John's, Newfoundland while Embuscade refitted in New York.", "Courtenay suggested to his prisoner that he would be keen to meet Bompart in battle, and he agreed to send a message into New York via the pilot boat with a challenge for Bompart to bring Embuscade out of the neutral harbour and meet Boston off Sandy Hook. The pilot was initially unable to locate the French captain, and so instead posted the challenge in a coffeehouse in the city, from where the news spread rapidly.Clowes, p. 478 Bompart came to learn of it, and spent the next two days preparing his warship; historian Edward Pelham Brenton has claimed that Bompart was joined by 100 armed American volunteers, which he calls \"a flagrant violation of the law of nations\". After a consultation among the French officers Embuscade sailed from New York on the night of 30 July, although Courtenay was almost forced to miss the rendezvous: on the afternoon of 30 July a large French battle squadron of the ships of the line \u00c9ole and Patriote, four frigates and six smaller vessels passed northwards along the New Jersey coast, heading for New York. In the face of such a powerful force Boston was temporarily forced to withdraw to open water, but the squadron did not deviate to investigate the frigate and had passed into New York harbour by nightfall, allowing Courtenay to return to his station.Woodman, p. 30", "Edwards' report contained his account of Courtenay's death in battle, and it was widely accepted at the time. However rumours began circulating that Courtenay had not been killed but merely stunned by the blow, and that his death may have come as a result of Edwards order for him to be thrown overboard.Crawford, p. 392 This second account was accepted by Courtenay's family and shortly after Edwards' death in January 1823 from the effects of the wound he received in the action with Embuscade, the naval officer and historian Edward Pelham Brenton published his work Naval History of Great Britain from the Year 1783 to 1822, in which he wrote that:"]}, {"page": "John Sheridan (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["Sheridan was born c. 1778 and entered the navy in 1795, shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars.

On 27 October 1803 Merlin and the schooner  captured the 2-gun privateer Sept Fr\u00e8res, after which Sheridan saw action at the bombardments of Le Havre on 23 July and 1 August 1804. Sheridan then took part in the burning of the wreck of the frigate  near Barfleur on 10 December 1804, the Shannon having run aground under French shore batteries while sailing in company with Merlin. Sheridan went on to be active during the war with Russia which broke out in 1807, serving aboard . He was present at the capture of three Russian ships off the coast of Finland, and at the attack on several Russian gunboats at Percola Point. In the latter action, a Russian flotilla was attacked on the night of 7 July by 17 boats, led by Lieutenant Hawkey of , who was killed in the action.

In Britain, the Admiralty approved of Cornwallis' actions, suggesting that the French were deliberately using the guise of trade to support Mysore against Britain. The action had no effect on the ongoing war in India, which was now centred on the inland city of Seringapatam.
