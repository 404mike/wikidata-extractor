She was runner-up at the British Open in 1991 and 2000, and reached a career-high ranking of World No. 3 in 1998. She won the British National Championship title four times in 1992, 1997, 1998 and 2001. As a junior player, Wright captained the England team which won the world junior team title in 1987. During the last few years of her career, Wright suffered from viral pneumonia, which left her with ear problems that prevented her from flying and competing outside the United Kingdom.\nShe represented England at the 1992 Women's World Team Squash Championships in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the 1994 Women's World Team Squash Championships in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey and the 1998 Women's World Team Squash Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.\nWright retired from professional squash in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sarah Fitz-Gerald", "response": ["|  Sue Wright", "|  Sue Wright"]}, {"page": "Cassie Jackman", "response": ["She lost the 1996 World Open final to Sarah Fitz-Gerald 9\u20134, 9\u20132, 4\u20139, 9\u20136 who would go on to win another four World Opens.
