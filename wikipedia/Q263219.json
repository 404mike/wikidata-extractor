After the two million-sellers, her success continued in 1962 with further hits including \"Tell Me What He Said\" and film appearances in Play It Cool and It's Trad, Dad!. In 1963, Shapiro toured with the Beatles. Since the 1970s, she has branched out as a performer in musical theatre and jazz; she appeared in the West End and toured extensively with the British jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton and his band.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Humphrey Lyttelton", "response": ["The band maintained a busy schedule, frequently performing sold-out shows across the country.
