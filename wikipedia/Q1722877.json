Thorrington would only manage two other appearances for Grimsby and missed the end of the season due to ongoing injury woes.

Bolton's loss at Chelsea coupled with Everton's draw against Coventry City meant that Gu\u00f0ni and Bolton were back in Division One. That season, Gu\u00f0ni scored one of the goals of the season; on 26 December 1997, Bolton played a home match against fellow strugglers Barnsley with both needing vital league points to climb away from trouble. Gu\u00f0ni equalised for the Trotters shortly before half time with a 35-yard shot from right-back which sailed into the top corner past the goalkeeper David Watson. The next season saw Gu\u00f0ni suffer a series of niggling injury problems and was one of his most frustrating seasons at Bolton. Players such as Mark Fish, Andy Todd, Jon Newsome and Paul Warhurst had all played in the heart of the defence in his absence, rumours even circulated that he may leave but this was soon dispelled."]}, {"page": "Terry Fenwick", "response": ["In 1993 Fenwick signed for Swindon Town, at that time a newly promoted Premier League team.

Fenwick played 28 games during this season, and was noted for involvement in an incident which resulted in a broken leg for Paul Warhurst.
