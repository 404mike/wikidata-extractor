Her grave \u2013 a flamboyant monument \u2013 was seen occasionally. Their absent father, Reg, appeared once in \"Thicker Than Water\" (played by Peter Woodthorpe), before leaving under a cloud, never to be seen again.  Other members of the Trotter family were rarely sighted, the exceptions being cousins Stan (Mike Kemp) and Jean  (Maureen Sweeney), who attended Grandad's funeral. In \"The Second Time Around\", the woman they believed to be Auntie Rose (Beryl Cooke) turned out to be no relation at all but the woman who had moved into Rose's house some years earlier. After Rodney met Cassandra, her parents Alan (Denis Lill) and Pam (Wanda Ventham) became recurring characters. Raquel's parents, James and Audrey (Michael Jayston and Ann Lynn), appeared in \"Time On Our Hands\", and it was James who discovered the antique watch which made the Trotters millionaires."]}, {"page": "Cooke", "response": ["* Beryl Cooke (1906\u20132001), British actress"]}, {"page": "The Troubleshooters", "response": ["*Miss Jenkins (Beryl Cooke 1970\u201371)"]}, {"page": "The Blood Beast Terror", "response": ["* Beryl Cooke as Housekeeper"]}, {"page": "2001 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 21 August \u2013 Beryl Cooke, actress (born 1906)"]}, {"page": "The Second Time Around (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Beryl Cooke"]}, {"page": "1906 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 1 November \u2013 Beryl Cooke, actress (died 2001)"]}, {"page": "Happy Ever After (British TV series)", "response": ["*Beryl Cooke as Aunt Lucy"]}, {"page": "Bluebirds (TV series)", "response": ["*Beryl Cooke as Mrs Jenkinson "]}, {"page": "East London Cemetery", "response": ["* Beryl Cooke"]}, {"page": "Beryl (given name)", "response": ["* Beryl Cooke, actress"]}, {"page": "She'll Follow You Anywhere", "response": ["* Beryl Cooke ...
