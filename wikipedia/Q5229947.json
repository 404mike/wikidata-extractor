This line-up then released a new album, 2032, in 2009 and toured in support, including the Glade stage at Glastonbury Festival.

I'm Dead!, featuring guest appearances from Steve Hillage on guitar, Didier Malherbe on duduk and Graham Clark on violin, with Daevid Allen's vocals appearing on two tracks. Rejoice!

One was the improvisational, three-piece Orchestra Futura consisting of Nelson, Dave Sturt (bass) and Theo Travis (assorted woodwind, brass).

The other was the more conventional rock oriented, seven-piece Bill Nelson and the Gentlemen Rocketeers (again including Sturt and Travis) which played songs with vocals from the extensive Nelson/Be-Bop Deluxe back catalogue.", "* Dreams And Absurdities (2015) Dave Sturt Esoteric/Antenna"]}, {"page": "Steve Hillage", "response": ["His next association with Gong was a guest guitar solo on the title track of their 2016 album \"Rejoice! I'm Dead\", their first album recorded after the death of Daevid Allen.

Soon after, Hillage made a few guest appearances at Gong gigs (sometimes being billed as Gong featuring Steve Hillage), culminating in late 2018 with the announcement that Hillage & Giraudy had tapped the current lineup of Gong to be their backing band/opening act for a series of Steve Hillage Band shows in 2019.

In March 2011, the band played live to cameras at Metropolis Studios, London.

The band decided to continue on with the album, which became the 1992 release Breathing the Storm on the Red Hot Records (re-released on CD by Voiceprint in 2001). This trio then released a follow-up album Distant Echoes in 1993, with guest appearances from Theo Travis of Gong (saxophone), David Cross of King Crimson (violin) and Tom Newman.
