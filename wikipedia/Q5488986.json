He was educated at Rossall School and Exeter College, Oxford. A right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler, who occasionally kept wicket, Phillips scored 4,310 first-class runs.  He played the majority of his career for Somerset, but also represented the county of his birth, Monmouthshire in second-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["In 1892 Palairet was elected captain of the Oxford team, and according to Wisden, \"had a most brilliant season.\" Palairet used himself heavily as a bowler for the university; only George Berkeley bowled more deliveries.Bolton (1962), pp. 140\u2013144. He took five wickets in an innings for the first of two occasions during his career in the first innings of Oxford's match against the Gentlemen, and followed it up with four wickets in each innings against Lancashire, a match in which he also scored a half-century. He recorded the best bowling figures of his first-class career in the return match against Lancashire, taking six wickets for 84 runs at Old Trafford, and in the following game against Sussex, Bolton says, \"Palairet played two beautiful innings and bowled to some effect\". Facing Cambridge in the University match, he was out without scoring in the first innings, but centuries from Malcolm Jardine and Vernon Hill took Oxford to 365. Cambridge were dismissed for 160, and were forced to follow on, whereupon they reached 388, leaving Oxford requiring 184 runs to win. Palairet, who had injured himself while fielding, opted not to open the batting, promoting Frank Phillips in his place. Oxford started poorly, falling to 17 for two, but coming in at number five, Palairet batted for an hour and a half to score 71 runs and help his side to victory. He topped the batting averages for Oxford in 1892, scoring 509 runs at 36.35, and his 28 wickets came at 22.28.", "The subsequent 1901 season was, statistically, his best. He trailed only Fry and Ranjitsinhji in the national batting averages, and drew particular acclaim for his innings of 173 against Yorkshire. The all-conquering Yorkshire were reigning County Champions, unbeaten in 1900; the match against Somerset at Headingley was the only one they lost in 1901. Somerset were dismissed for 87 in their first innings, and Yorkshire reached 325 to lead by 238 runs on first innings. Palairet and his fellow opener Len Braund\u2014both of whom had been out without scoring in the first innings\u2014then scored 222 runs together in 140 minutes at the start of Somerset's second innings, each scoring a century. After the dismissal of Braund for 107, Palairet continued, eventually being caught and bowled for 173. Frank Phillips added a third century (122), and Somerset reached a total of 630. Yorkshire were bowled out on a wearing pitch for 113, with Braund and Beaumont Cranfield each taking four wickets, and Somerset won by 279 runs.Green (1980), pp. 277\u2013278. The Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, declared that it was \"one of the best matches I ever lost.\" In the same year, Palairet scored 182 against Lancashire and 194 against Sussex. Altogether he scored five centuries and eleven half-centuries in 1901, averaging 57.75 for his 1,906 runs\u2014the highest season's total of his career."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Frank Phillips (1897\u20131911) 67 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Fred Coyle", "response": ["He played his first match for Somerset in August 1903, when he, Sammy Woods and Frank Phillips came into the team replacing John Daniell, Oswald Samson and Gilbert Vassall. Facing Kent in Taunton, Coyle was not brought on to bowl until the visitors had already accrued 157 runs, and only bowled three overs in the innings. He opened the bowling in the second innings, but only bowled four overs before the game finished as a draw.
