He took five wickets in an innings on three occasions with his leg breaks, but except in 1901 (when he claimed 57 wickets) he generally bowled little.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Brown", "response": ["*Jack Brown (cricketer) (1869\u20131904), English cricketer", "*Jack Brown (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "1894 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Young Batsmen of the Season \u2013 Bill Brockwell, Jack Brown, C B Fry, Tom Hayward, Archie MacLaren"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Jack Brown"]}, {"page": "Bramall Lane", "response": ["In 1897, Jack Brown and John Tunnicliffe recorded a first wicket score of 378 against Sussex\u2014a ground record that has never been beaten.

Yorkshire improved in 1883 and finished second behind Nottinghamshire in the unofficial County Championship. However, the remainder of the 1880s was disappointing for the team and its supporters. Kilburn said that Yorkshire \"continued to be an unreliable side, mingling brilliant achievement with miserable performance\". The basic problem was that the older players were past their peak while younger replacements did not make the progress expected. A poor season on the field in 1889 was reflected by reduced income and changes were made with several good new players being introduced. These included Jack Brown, David Hunter and Stanley Jackson, while Bobby Peel was becoming increasingly effective as a bowling all-rounder. They were followed by John Tunnicliffe, David Denton, Ted Wainwright and George Hirst.

The team that Hawke inherited from Emmett, which Hawke referred to as \"the boys of my old brigade\", was in decline by 1886 and several players would retire or be dismissed during the next couple of years so that, by the end of the 1887 season, it was clear that Yorkshire faced what Coldham called \"a protracted period of rebuilding\".Coldham, p. 59. Within the next seasons, the likes of Ted Peate, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Louis Hall and George Ulyett had all retired. Left arm spinner Bobby Peel, wicket-keeper David Hunter, all-rounder George Hirst, opening batsman Jack Brown and the amateurs Stanley Jackson and Ernest Smith were among the replacements who formed Yorkshire's successful teams of the 1890s and 1900s.Hodgson, p. 53."]}, {"page": "Bobby Peel", "response": ["Amid great public interest\u2014the game was advertised as \"the match of the century\"Knox, p. 254.\u2014and great tension,Frith, pp. 158\u201359. the decisive final Test match was played.

However, these players took time to become established and stalwarts of the team in the previous decade, such as Louis Hall and George Ulyett, were coming to the end of their careers. The additional strain of the absence of players selected for representative games meant that a slight revival in 1890 to third in the first official County Championship table, was followed by another poor season in 1891 when the team finished eighth out of nine. Criticism of the management produced \"self-defence in the annual report\" and, in 1893, the club was reorganised to properly represent the whole county. Further reorganisation came when Ellison died in 1898 and Hawke assumed the club presidency as well as captaincy; when Wostinholm retired in 1902 after being club secretary for 38 years, the county offices were moved from Sheffield to the more central location of Leeds."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1919\u20131927)", "response": ["Sutcliffe's overall record in 1923 was 2,220 runs at 41.11 with 3\u00a0centuries, 15\u00a0fifties and a highest score of 139 against Somerset.
