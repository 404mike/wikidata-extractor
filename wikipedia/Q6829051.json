He could be charming and witty or ruthless and harsh, while many people who knew him believed him to be innately shy.Douglas, pp. xiii\u2013xiv. David Frith describes him as a complex figure who could change moods quickly. Although he could be friendly off the field, he became hostile and determined once he stepped onto the field. At his memorial service, he was described by Hubert Ashton as being \"provocative, austere, brusque, shy, humble, thoughtful, kindly, proud, sensitive, single-minded and possessed of immense moral and physical courage,\" and Frith argues that these varied qualities are easily proven by what was said about him.Frith, p. 447."]}, {"page": "Gubby Allen", "response": ["At Eton, Allen played many sports,Swanton, pp. 43\u201344. but his academic performance was no more than respectable, and he later admitted to laziness.Swanton, p. 43. In cricket, Allen played for his school house team and had reasonable success with bat and ball; by 1918 he was house cricket captain. After a trial match, and a spell in the school second team, he progressed to the Eton first team in 1919.Swanton, pp. 27\u201330. The effects of a rib injury limited his bowling, and he achieved little with the bat. Even so, he was chosen to play in the prestigious match against Harrow School, played annually at Lord's in London.Swanton, p. 31. In his second innings, he scored 69 runs, the highest individual score of the game, and Eton won the match.Swanton, pp. 32\u201333. His rib injury continued to trouble him in 1920, and caused him such pain that he considered abandoning bowling altogether. The new Eton coach George Hirst persuaded him to continue,Swanton, p. 37. and a few weeks later Allen took nine for 19 (nine wickets while conceding 19 runs) in an innings against Winchester. But other than this performance, Allen was ineffective.Swanton, pp. 38\u201339. More successful in 1921, he opened the batting for a time; he also opened the bowling, topping the Eton bowling averages.Swanton, p. 42. He had some success at Lord's against Harrow and a particularly fast bowling spell in this match was seen by Hubert Ashton, who was to captain the Cambridge University team the following yearSwanton, pp. 41\u201342.\u2014Allen had already been approved for a place at Trinity College, Cambridge beginning later that year.Swanton, p. 40.
