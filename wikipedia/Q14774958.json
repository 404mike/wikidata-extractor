It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883, when he died a stateless person at age 64. Family and friends in London buried his body in Highgate Cemetery (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists (George Eliot's grave is nearby). According to Francis Wheen there were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral,Wheen 2001. p. 382 . however research from contemporary sources identifies thirteen named individuals attending the funeral. They were, Friedrich Engels, Eleanor Marx, Edward Aveling, Paul Lafargue, Charles Longuet, Helene Demuth, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Gottlieb Lemke, Frederick Lessner, G Lochner, Sir Ray Lankester, Carl Schorlemmer and Ernest Radford.John Shepperd, 'Who was really at Marx's funeral?', in \"Friends of Highgate Cemetery Newsletter \", April (2018), pp. 10\u201311. https://highgatecemetery.org/uploads/2018-04_Newsletter_final_web.pdf  A contemporary newspaper account claims that 25 to 30 relatives and friends attended the funeral.'Dr Karl Marx', in The People, 25 March 1883, p.3.

The next day the correction came from Paris; and when his friends and followers hastened to his house in Haverstock Hill, to learn the time and place of burial, they learned that he was already in the cold ground.
