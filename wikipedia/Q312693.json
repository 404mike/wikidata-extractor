His solo music has covered a particularly individual musical terrain ranging from covers of pop singles to shifting, amorphous song collections drawing on elements of jazz, folk and nursery rhyme.\nWyatt retired from his music career in 2014, stating \"there is a pride in [stopping], I don\u2019t want [the music] to go off.\" He is married to English painter and songwriter Alfreda Benge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elvis Costello", "response": ["In 1983, he released Punch the Clock, featuring female backing vocal duo (Afrodiziak) and a four-piece horn section (the TKO Horns), alongside the Attractions.
