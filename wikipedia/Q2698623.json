It is possible this was to be a final haircut prior to fulfilling his vow to become a Nazirite for a defined period of time. With Priscilla and Aquila, the missionaries then sailed to Ephesus and then Paul alone went on to Caesarea to greet the Church there. He then traveled north to Antioch, where he stayed for some time (, perhaps about a year), before leaving again on a third missionary journey. Some New Testament texts suggest that he also visited Jerusalem during this period for one of the Jewish feasts, possibly Pentecost. Textual critic Henry Alford and others consider the reference to a Jerusalem visit to be genuine and it accords with , according to which Paul and Trophimus the Ephesian had previously been seen in Jerusalem."]}, {"page": "Split infinitive", "response": ["In 1840, Richard Taylor also condemned split infinitives as a \"disagreeable affectation,\" and in 1859, Solomon Barrett, Jr., called them \"a common fault.\" However, the issue seems not to have attracted wider public attention until Henry Alford addressed it in his Plea for the Queen's English in 1864:", "A correspondent states as his own usage, and defends, the insertion of an adverb between the sign of the infinitive mood and the verb. He gives as an instance, \"to scientifically illustrate.\" But surely this is a practice entirely unknown to English speakers and writers. It seems to me, that we ever regard the to of the infinitive as inseparable from its verb. And, when we have already a choice between two forms of expression, \"scientifically to illustrate\" and \"to illustrate scientifically,\" there seems no good reason for flying in the face of common usage.A Plea for the Queen's English: Stray notes on Speaking and Spelling,  Henry Alford, Strahan, 1866, page 188Quoted by Hall (1882).", "Henry Alford, in his Plea for the Queen's English in 1864 went further, stating that use of the \"split infinitive\" was \"a practice entirely unknown to English speakers and writers.\""]}, {"page": "Codex Vaticanus", "response": ["Tregelles left Rome after five months without accomplishing his object.

In 1808, Henry Alford cast doubt on Tabor due to the possible continuing Roman utilization of a fortress which Antiochus the Great built on Tabor in 219 BC. Others have countered that even if Tabor was fortified by Antiochus, this does not rule out a transfiguration at the summit.

These translations were composed by people like John Chandler, John Mason Neale, Thomas Helmore, Edward Caswall, Jane Laurie Borthwick and Catherine Winkworth. Besides stimulating the translation of medieval hymns, and use of plainsong melodies, the Oxford Reformers, inspired by Reginald Heber's work, also began to write original hymns.
