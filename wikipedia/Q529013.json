Later in the month Barry became the 10th player in Premier League history to make 500 career appearances in a 3\u20132 win over Newcastle United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20131 victory over Hull City on 19 October; the goal was originally awarded to Kevin Mirallas; however, the goals panel ruled that en route to the goal, Barry was deemed to have got the last touch on the ball before it beat Hull keeper Allan McGregor. He scored a long range effort in a 2\u20130 victory against Norwich City on 11 January 2014. He became a mainstay in Everton's midfield during the season and forged a partnership with James McCarthy. Barry completed the most passes of any Everton player during his spell as he helped the club amass a club record of 72 Premier League points to finish fifth.
