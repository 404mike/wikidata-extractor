Manley advertised the service in part through its use of modern Web technologies such as XML, RSS, and \"web services\". Paying users were offered unlimited bandwidth and disk storage, the ability to lock their own webcomics behind a subscription wall or to sell advertisements on their own pages, an automated email list, a scheduling system, and an archive management system, among other features. Webcomics Nation quickly became Manley's most profitable project. "]}, {"page": "Reinventing Comics", "response": ["A revised version of Reinventing Comics was released in 2009.

For each webcomic in the Morning Improv series, McCloud picked a title that was sent to him by one of his fans and based the rest of the story around it. McCloud continued The Morning Improv in July 2003, after a year-long hiatus, using a slightly different mechanism to select a title. Rather than picking a title himself, McCloud set up a system to allow his readers to \"vote\" for one of ten submitted titles by donating small amounts of money to McCloud through BitPass. The series stopped in June 2004, finishing with a webcomic using Daniel Merlin Goodbrey's Tarquin Engine."]}, {"page": "Clickies", "response": ["| Daniel Merlin Goodbrey"]}]}}
