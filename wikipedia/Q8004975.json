Bald decided to blast the cliff face which then fell down onto the foreshore to form the base for the new road.", "William Bald was a civil engineer who left a great legacy to the people of the Glens of Antrim, and created one of the finest tourist routes in the World.

From 1774 until the 1820s, the grand juries of 25 Irish counties commissioned maps at scales of one or two inches per Irish mile but the County Mayo maps (1809\u20131830) were surveyed and drawn by William Bald in English miles and just rescaled to Irish miles for printing. The Ordnance Survey of Ireland, from its establishment in 1824, used English miles. Thomas Telford's Howth\u2013Dublin Post Office extension of the London\u2013Holyhead turnpike had its mileposts in English miles. Irish measure was formally abolished by the 1824 Weights and Measures Act but the Irish Post Office continued to use the measure until 1856.  An 1800 act fixed the maximum penalty for burning land at 10 pounds per \"Irish plantation acre\"; in 1846 a fine of 70 pounds was overturned in Queen's Bench as exceeding this limit: although the evidence related to seven Irish acres, the form of conviction \"seven acres\" must legally have referred to statute acres. In two 1847 parliamentary returns of distances between Irish towns, values were in Irish miles for some counties and statute miles for others."]}, {"page": "Bald, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Bald"]}]}}
