His original sidekick was Detective Sergeant Peter Livingstone (Neil Duncan). Livingstone represented the new breed of young graduates entering the police force and frequently had a difficult relationship with Taggart as a result. Taggart's boss in the pilot was Superintendent Robert Murray (Tom Watson). This humour was continued in the subsequent series when Taggart's boss after the second episode, \"Dead Ringer\", being Superintendent Jack McVitie (Iain Anders). Another important character was Taggart's wife Jean (Harriet Buchan), whose physical disability did not prevent her from pursuing a number of interests in life, while her cynical husband stuck mainly to his job. Throughout the McManus era, there was nearly always a sub-plot in every episode which involved the domestic life of the Taggarts, which on occasion became intertwined with the case being investigated. The most memorable of these was the Taggarts' ongoing care of Jean's senile Aunt Hettie (Sheila Donald), whom Jim despises and begrudges staying in his house. This sub-plot ran through 1990\u201391 until the Hettie character was killed off in the 1991 season finale, \"Violent Delights, in which her funeral is carried out by a corrupt firm of undertakers who are also the subject of Taggart's investigation.\"", "* Tom Watson as Superintendent Robert Murray (1983\u20131985)"]}, {"page": "Mark McManus", "response": ["McManus began playing the title character in the crime drama Taggart in September 1983, alongside Neil Duncan, Tom Watson and Robert Robertson.
