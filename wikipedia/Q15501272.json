He also suggested that some injuries were displaced from car drivers to pedestrians and other road users. The \"Isles Report\" echoed these concerns. Adams subsequently argued that the reduction in fatalities that followed the introduction of legislation could not be attributed with confidence to seat-belt use due to the simultaneous introduction of breath testing for driving under the influence of alcohol."]}, {"page": "Seat belt legislation", "response": ["The most common basis for disputing estimates of the benefits of seat belts is risk compensation  and risk homeostasis, advanced by researchers John Adams and Gerald Wilde. The idea of this theory is that, if the risk of death or injury from a car crash is reduced by the wearing of seat belts, drivers will respond by reducing the precautions they take against crashes. Adams accepts the hypothesis that wearing seat belts improves a vehicle occupant's chances of surviving a crash. (primary source) In order to explain the disparity between the agreed improvement in crash survival and the observed results, Adams and Wilde argue that protecting someone from the consequences of risky behaviour may tend to encourage greater risk taking. Wilde states, \"to compel a person to use protection from the consequences of hazardous driving, as seat belt laws do, is to encourage hazardous driving. A fine for non-compliance will encourage seat belt use, but the fact that the law fails to increase people's desire to be safe encourages compensatory behaviour.\""]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* John Adams, Professor of geography and authority on risk compensation"]}, {"page": "John Adams (Risk)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Adams (geographer)"]}, {"page": "Smeed's law", "response": ["However, John Adams of University College London argued in 1995 that Smeed's law linking deaths, vehicle-miles and population was still valid for a variety of countries over time, claiming that the relationship held for 62 countries.

Variations from the trend were normally better explained through economics, rather than claimed safety interventions.
