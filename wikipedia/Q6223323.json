The crucial and difficult link across Morecambe Bay between Ulverston and Carnforth on the main line was promoted, as the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway, by a group led by John Brogden and opened in 1857. It was promptly purchased by the Furness Railway."]}, {"page": "Tondu", "response": ["Sir Robert Price took over leases around Tondu Farm previously granted to William Bryant, the liquidator of John Bedford's business. Sir Robert had ambitions as an ironmaster and began to develop an ironworks alongside the Dyffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway at Tondu in the late 1830s. He traded as the Glamorgan Coal and Iron Company. Progress was initially slow due to a trade recession in the early 1840s, but there was a revival in 1843 and the first furnace at Tondu was blown-in in 1844. The year 1843 was significant for the Tondu district as extensive reserves of black-band ironstone were discovered six miles (10\u00a0km) to the north in the Maesteg area during that year. The discovery, and an unprecedented period of growth in the iron trade during the mid-1840s, prompted Sir Robert to develop his works at Tondu and open-up the Tywith coal and ironstone mine near present-day Nantyffyllon, Maesteg. Typically for the iron trade, prices fell sharply after the short-lived boom period and, as a result, the Tondu Works struggled to survive through the early 1850s and Sir Robert Price faced bankruptcy. However, because of the progress made during the years 1843\u20131847, the Tondu Ironworks and associated mines formed a significant pocket of production in mid-Glamorgan with some potential. That potential was recognised by the Lancashire firm of John Brogden and Sons who bought the Tondu property in 1854.  ", "In February 1854 John Brogden sent his fourth son James, aged 22, to revive and run the business. In July 1854, John Brogden signed a new 99-year lease with Jane Nicholl. James rapidly reorganised and expanded the works. James rebuilt Tondu House between 1854 and 1857.  In the 1861 census he said he was employing 900 men and farming  with 20 men.", "In 1869, John Brogden died and his eldest son Alexander Brogden came to Tondu to take charge of the business. In 1872 Alexander formed a new joint-stock company, the Llynvi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company Limited which merged Brogdens\u2019 Glamorgan business interests with those of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co. This moved was probably forced - Brogdens' Tywith mine had encroached on the other company's territory and the merger was in lieu of compensation. However the new company was short-lived. The Llynfi company was financed by debentures which could be withdrawn at short notice. A major debenture holder did withdraw making the merged company insolvent. It was wound up by creditors in 1878. The liquidator made a number of attempts to make the business viable until it was taken over by North's Navigation Collieries (1889) Ltd.The Iron Industry in Maesteg, David Lewis, Swansea 2007"]}, {"page": "Ulverstone and Lancaster Railway", "response": ["Consequently, Furness, instead of finding the main line on its doorstep, had to make its own arrangements to join its local rail network to the national one. Any short connection southwards would necessarily involve a locally financed crossing of Morecambe Bay and this was a daunting prospect \u2014 the quicksands and fierce tides of the bay are still notorious. The 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster reminded many people of the dangers. Nevertheless the iron miners needed a good connection in order to make their product competitive. The directors of the Furness Railway were not in a hurry to take it on so it was promoted by John Brogden and Sons, a Manchester-based firm of railway contractors and promoters who had expanded into iron mining activity in the Furness area.Richardson (1870), p.\u00a019", "The Ulverstone and Lancaster Railway Act received the Royal Assent in 1851.

The sons were adventurous in running the business. By 1874 they were in difficulties. They had retained the trust funds in the business. Samuel was unable to persuade them to move the funds to a safer place. Perhaps for the sake of family relations he was reluctant to force the issue as the law and the trust's terms required. This left all the trustees in Breach of trust. If Brogdens should fail, all Samuel's fellow trustees would fail with it and Samuel would have to refund the trust himself. All the assets of James and William, his brothers, were potentially forfeit because they were also his partners and therefore liable for his debts.", "Overall it seems fair to say that this three brother partnership would probably have continued but for Samuel's Brogden trusteeship. With hindsight he seems to have failed to foresee and manage the threats which his Brogden trusteeship might present to his Budgett partnership. In 1874 Brogdens were in difficulties and he may have been reluctant to become the straw that broke the camel's back. At the same time his legal advisors would surely have pointed out the pressing nature of his trusteeship responsibilities. He could perhaps have resolved this conflict by calling a meeting in 1874 or early 1875 between the Billings and the Brogdens. There he would have the aim to resolve the conflict either by getting Brogdens to make the trust's cash available to a neutral third party, who would be instructed to invest it as John Brogden's will directed, or by getting the Billings to agree with the Brogdens another form of words which was mutually agreeable, legally binding, and supervised by a third party, or by agreeing with the Billings to begin legal proceedings against his Brogden brothers-in-law. This would have extricated Samuel from his difficult and ultimately ruinous position."]}]}}
