Les Smith (piano) left the group after the tour to continue his career as an architect. His replacement was Ian Hines (piano), brother of Frazer Hines who played Jamie in the Doctor Who television series.

In late August, Kuy left to join The Outlaws and was briefly replaced by the 16 years old Vic Briggs, who was on his school holidays and could only participate for three weeks.
