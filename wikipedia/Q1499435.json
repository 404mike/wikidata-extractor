As of 2009, he was the Emeritus Babraham Fellow in the Signalling Programme Department of the Babraham Institute, Cambridge, and honorary professor of cell signalling at the University of Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1938 in science", "response": ["* October 22 \u2013 Michael Berridge, Rhodesian-born British physiologist and biochemist (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "1983 in science", "response": ["* November 3 \u2013 Michael Berridge and colleagues publish their discovery that inositol trisphosphate acts as a second messenger system in cell signaling."]}, {"page": "Shaw Prize", "response": ["| Sir Michael Berridge"]}]}}
