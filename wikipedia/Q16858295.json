She had a considerable number of literary and social acquaintances including Augusta Leigh and Lady Cork.  During her own lifetime she was sometimes confused with Emma Roberts, with whom she corresponded, though the two women were not related.  They were about the same age and they were both referred to as Miss Roberts.  Unusually for single women of that era they had also both travelled separately to Calcutta within two or three years of each other.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Emma Roberts (author)", "response": ["Emma Roberts should not be confused with her near-contemporary Jane Roberts, with whom she corresponded."]}, {"page": "Jane Roberts (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jane Roberts (1929\u20131984) was an American author, poet and spirit medium", "Jane Roberts may also refer to:", "* Jane Roberts (died 1684), alias for the highwayrobber Jane Voss", "* Jane Roberts (author) (1792 \u2013 after 1861), English author", "* Jane Roberts (first lady) ( 1819\u20131914), First Lady of Liberia", "* Jane Roberts (politician) (born 1955), British psychiatrist and Labour Party politician", "*Jane Roberts (literary scholar), Northern Irish literary scholar"]}]}}
