Fett's armor was originally designed for \"super troopers\", and was adapted for Fett as the script developed. Screen-tested in all-white, Fett's armor eventually garnered a subdued color scheme intended to visually place him between white-armored \"rank-and-file\" Imperial stormtroopers and Vader, who wears black. This color scheme had the added bonus of conveying the \"gray morality\" of his character. The character's armor was designed to appear to have been scavenged from multiple sources, and it is adorned with trophies. A description of Fett's armor in the mid-1979 Bantha Tracks newsletter catalyzed \"rampant speculation\" about his origins. By 1979, Fett's backstory included having served in an army of Imperial shock troops which had battled the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars."]}, {"page": "Star Wars (film)", "response": ["| John Barry, Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley and Roger Christian", "| Norman Reynolds and Leslie Dilley"]}, {"page": "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "response": ["Producer Frank Marshall, who had experience on smaller independent films, was hired because Spielberg believed he would keep the film on schedule and budget.
