In February 1949,  after an investigation into possible corrupt practices in the Board of Trade, Belcher resigned his ministerial and parliamentary offices when the Lynskey tribunal determined that he had misused his  powers as a minister by granting favours in return for small gifts.\nBelcher, a former railway clerk, entered parliament in the 1945 general election, and was one of the first of that intake to be promoted to office. As minister, he sought to build up good relations with the business community, and maintained that while he may have been unwise in his choice of friends and associates, his actions did not amount to corruption. On leaving parliament he returned to his clerical job with the railways. He died in 1964.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political scandals in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* John Belcher corruptly influenced \u2013 led to Lynskey Tribunal"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Belcher"]}, {"page": "Attlee ministry", "response": ["|John Belcher||12 January 1946||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade", "response": ["* 1946\u20131949 John Belcher"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|John Belcher"]}, {"page": "Douglas Houghton, Baron Houghton of Sowerby", "response": ["After John Belcher quit the House of Commons over accusations of minor dishonesty, Houghton was persuaded to seek nomination for the subsequent by-election.

Under the chairmanship of a High Court judge, Sir George Lynskey, it sat in November and December 1948, hearing testimony from some sixty witnesses who included a number of government ministers and other high-ranking public servants. Much of the inquiry was centered on the relationship between the junior trade minister, John Belcher, and a self-styled business agent, Sidney Stanley, who claimed to have considerable influence in government circles which he was prepared to exercise on behalf of the business community. In its findings, published in January 1949, the tribunal found that Belcher, who admitted that he had accepted hospitality and small gifts from Stanley and from the distiller Sir Maurice Bloch, had been improperly influenced in his ministerial decision-making, although it dismissed allegations that he had received large sums of cash. A director of the Bank of England, George Gibson, was likewise found to have used his position to obtain personal advantage. All other ministers and officials were exonerated. Belcher resigned from his ministerial post and from parliament; Gibson was required to resign from his Bank directorship and from other public offices.
