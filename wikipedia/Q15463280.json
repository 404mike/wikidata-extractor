In February 1949,  after an investigation into possible corrupt practices in the Board of Trade, Belcher resigned his ministerial and parliamentary offices when the Lynskey tribunal determined that he had misused his  powers as a minister by granting favours in return for small gifts.\nBelcher, a former railway clerk, entered parliament in the 1945 general election, and was one of the first of that intake to be promoted to office. As minister, he sought to build up good relations with the business community, and maintained that while he may have been unwise in his choice of friends and associates, his actions did not amount to corruption. On leaving parliament he returned to his clerical job with the railways. He died in 1964.", "link_mentions": {}}}
