During the mission he landed in Hong Kong in July, 1816.  He walked from the shore of Hong Kong to Hong Kong Village via Wong Chuk Hang.  After the trip, Wong Chuk Hang was named Staunton Creek and the valley where Hong Kong Village was located was named Staunton Valley. Staunton Creek later became a cesspool of mud and rotting sampans and was eventually cleared to create Wong Chuk Hang Nullah with the residents housed in Wong Chuk Hang Estate. Hong Kong Village was most likely Wong Chuk Hang Lo Wai; only Wong Chuk Hang San Wai still exists at the bottom of Shouson Hill. After the ceding of Hong Kong from China to Great Britain, Staunton Street in Central was named after him."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1820\u20131837)", "response": ["*Henry Ellis (1777\u20131855)"]}, {"page": "Henry Ellis", "response": ["Henry Ellis may refer to:", "* Henry Ellis (governor) (1721\u20131806), explorer, author, and second colonial Governor of Georgia", "* Henry Ellis (librarian) (1777\u20131869), English librarian", "* Henry Ellis (diplomat) (1788\u20131855), British diplomat", "* Henry Ellis, 2nd Viscount Clifden (1761\u20131836), Irish politician"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Henry Ellis (1788\u20131855), ad interim Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia (1814\u20131815)"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Brazil", "response": ["* 1842: Henry Ellis, extraordinary and special mission"]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Iran", "response": ["*13 April 1814: Sir Henry Ellis, Deputy Minister Plenipotentiary (ad interim), in James Morier's absence", "*1835\u20131836: Sir Henry Ellis, ambassador"]}, {"page": "John McNeill (diplomat)", "response": ["On 30 June 1835, he was appointed secretary of the special embassy sent to Tehran under Henry Ellis to congratulate Mohammad Shah Qajar on his accession to the Persian throne.

When Malcolm's embassy quit Persia, Monteith was one of the officers left behind. During the Russo-Persian War, he went with Abbas Mirza to Erivan, and accompanied an expedition into Georgia, in which the Persians were unsuccessful. During the four succeeding campaigns against the Russians in 1810-13 Monteith was in command of a frontier force of cavalry with six guns, and of the garrison of Erivan. He was engaged in many skirmishes, and once was wounded. The war against Russia was supported by the British minister, Sir Harford Jones Brydges but Napoleon's retreat from Moscow brought about a reversal of British policy. When Henry Ellis and David Richard Morier concluded the treaty of Teheran between Great Britain and Persia, which was signed on 25 November 1814, and remained in force until the war of 1857, Monteith acted as secretary to Morier. He was still in Persia in 1819, and acted as aide-de-camp to Sir William Keir Grant, commanding the Bombay force sent against the Wahhabi pirates of the Persian Gulf, which destroyed their stronghold of Ras al-Khaimah. He was present with the Persians during the war with Turkey. He was then employed to ascertain the boundary between Persia and Turkey."]}, {"page": "Henry Ellis (MP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Ellis (diplomat)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Henry Ellis||", "|16 Feb 1821||Boston||Henry Ellis||||William Augustus Johnson"]}]}}
