Holding this view, \"the Tractarians were concerned ... to exalt the importance of the sacrament\", but were \"generally hostile to the doctrine of transubstantiation\". Article XXVIII of the Thirty-Nine Articles declares that \"Transubstantiation ... cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\" Edgar Gibson, the Bishop of Gloucester, who was Anglo-Catholic in churchmanship, defended the phrase \"cannot be Proved by Holy Writ\" in Article XXVIII, stating,", "Article XXVIII of the Articles of Religion states that, \"The Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper was not by Christ\u2019s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.\" Edgar Gibson, the Bishop of Gloucester explains this article, writing that \"The statement in the Article is worded with the utmost care, and with studied moderation. It cannot be said that any one of the practices is condemned or prohibited by it. It only amounts to this: that none of them can claim to be part of the original Divine institution.\" The Anglican priest Jonathan A. Mitchican rehashes this view, stating that Article XXVIII does not forbid the practice of reservation, but notes that it does not have an origin in Sacred Scripture."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Gloucester", "response": ["| 60px Edgar Gibson"]}, {"page": "Austin Hodson", "response": ["He was made deacon in Advent 1906 (23\u00a0December), by Edgar Gibson, Bishop of Gloucester, at Gloucester Cathedral, and ordained priest in 1908, serving his curacy at All\u00a0Saints', Cheltenham.
