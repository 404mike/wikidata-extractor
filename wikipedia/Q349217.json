He was awarded the 1953 BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles following the release of Trouble in Store, his first film in a lead role.\nWisdom gained celebrity status in lands as far apart as South America, Iran and many Eastern Bloc countries, particularly in Albania where his films were the only ones by Western actors permitted by dictator Enver Hoxha to be shown. Charlie Chaplin once referred to Wisdom as his \"favourite clown\".Wisdom later forged a career on Broadway in New York City and as a television actor, winning critical acclaim for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play Going Gently in 1981. He toured Australia and South Africa. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a hospice was named in his honour. In 1995, he was given the Freedom of the City of London and of Tirana. The same year, he was appointed OBE and was knighted five years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cult film", "response": ["A film can become the object of a cult following within a particular region or culture if it has unusual significance. For example, Norman Wisdom's films, friendly to Marxist interpretation, amassed a cult following in Albania, as they were among the few Western films allowed by the country's Communist rulers.  The Wizard of Oz (1939) and its star, Judy Garland, hold special significance to American and British gay culture, although it is a widely viewed and historically important film in greater American culture.  Similarly, James Dean and his brief film career have become icons of alienated youth.  Cult films can have such niche appeal that they are only popular within certain subcultures, such as Reefer Madness (1936) and Hemp for Victory (1942) among the stoner subculture.  Beach party musicals, popular among American surfers, failed to find an equivalent audience when imported to the United Kingdom.  When films target subcultures like this, they may seem unintelligible without the proper cultural capital.  Films which appeal to teenagers may offer subcultural identities that are easily recognized and differentiate various subcultural groups.  Films which appeal to stereotypical male activities, such as sports, can easily gain strong male cult followings.  Sports metaphors are often used in the marketing of cult films to males, such as emphasizing the \"extreme\" nature of the film, which increases the appeal to youth subcultures fond of extreme sports."]}, {"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Norman Wisdom (1915\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "February 4", "response": ["*  1915   \u2013 Norman Wisdom, English singer-songwriter and actor (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "October 4", "response": ["*2010 \u2013 Norman Wisdom, English actor, comedian, and singer-songwriter (b. 1915)"]}, {"page": "1915", "response": ["** Sir Norman Wisdom, English comedian, singer, and actor (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "Tony Hancock", "response": ["Hancock starred in the film The Rebel (1961), in which he plays the role of an office worker-turned-artist who finds himself successful after a move to Paris, but only as the result of mistaken identity.
