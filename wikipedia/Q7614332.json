After their final series in 1999, they were replaced by new presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson. Ledden and Wilson did not know each other at the start of the series, and so there was none of the interaction between them, as seen between Ball and Theakston. Additionally, SMTV Live which broadcast opposite on ITV was slowly becoming more popular, and gaining the audience the BBC was losing. After just one series, Ledden and Wilson's contracts were not renewed."]}, {"page": "Steve Wilson", "response": ["* Steve Wilson (jazz musician) (born 1961), American jazz saxophonist and flautist", "* Steve Wilson (drummer), former drummer for Against All Will", "* Steve Wilson (born 1967), Scottish guitarist, member of the Scottish rock band Stiltskin", "* Steve Wilson (producer), Nashville based songwriter, musician and producer of More Beautiful You", "* Steve Wilson (Ohio politician), Ohio state senator", "* Steve Wilson (basketball) (born 1948), American basketball player", "* Steve Wilson (offensive lineman) (born 1954), American NFL player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "* Steve Wilson (defensive back) (born 1957), American NFL player for the Denver Broncos", "* Steve Wilson (baseball) (born 1964), Canadian baseball player", "* Steve Wilson (football commentator) (born 1967), British Match of the Day commentator", "* Steve Wilson (footballer) (born 1974), English goalkeeper", "* Steve Wilson (director), American television director", "* Steve Wilson (presenter) (born 1974), English television presenter", "* Steve Wilson (reporter), American investigative reporter", "* Steve Wilson, character in Angels with Broken Wings"]}, {"page": "Feel the Fear", "response": ["Feel the Fear is a television programme for 7 to 12 year-olds broadcast on CITV in the United Kingdom.
