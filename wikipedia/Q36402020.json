L. Lundberg, An Inward Necessity (2003) Vallings, much younger than Malet, was the author's cousin, romantic companion and adopted daughter. The two traveled abroad frequently together, including spending significant time in France. Malet spent much of the end of her life in France where she was a part of \"high literary circles.\" She wrote frequently during this time, often out of economic necessity. Despite her tremendous critical and economic success during the height of her career, Malet died in penury at the home of a friend in Wales on 27 October 1931.", "Her later novels, such as The Survivors (1923) are proto-modernist in their explorations of marginal consciousnesses. E. F. Benson acknowledged his debt to her critical advice in his memoir Our Family Affairs.P. L. Lundberg, An Inward Necessity (2003) p. 162 Despite her importance, Malet died in poverty in 1931. Her last novel, The Private Life of Mr. Justice Syme, was completed after the author's death by her companion Gabrielle Vallings, and published in August 1932. Biographer Patricia Lorimer Lundberg attributes Malet's swift decline in reputation to multiple factors including the author's confusing sexual and gender politics and an \"evolving modernist style\" that \"met with sloppy reviews that endeavored to push her back into Victorianism.\" Lundberg's book, An Inward Necessity: the Writer's Life of Lucas Malet, remains the only major biography of the author. Talia Schaffer notes that Lundberg's book re-constructs historical gaps in the author's life created both by critical neglect and Malet's own actions (she asked Vallings to burn her personal papers, for example.) The biography uses Malet's life and work to show \"how late Victorian conditions fostered an oeuvre as ambitious as Malet's and how the advent of modernism damaged her reputation.\""]}]}}
