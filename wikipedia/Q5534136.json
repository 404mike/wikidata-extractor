The recording sessions for American Life started at late 2001, then was put on hold as Madonna filmed Swept Away in Malta and starred in the West End play Up for Grabs. She returned to the Olympic Recording Studios in late 2002 and finished off the sessions. The mixing for the track was done by Mark \"Spike\" Stent at the Westlake Recording Studios at West Hollywood, California, while Tim Young did the mastering of the song at Metropolis Studios in London. Michael Colombier did the string arrangement with Geoff Foster acting as the strings engineer, conducting at AIR Studios. For the instrumentation featured in the song, Ahmadza\u00ef played the guitars, and Stuart Price played the piano.", "Lyrically, the song discusses a lover who is the one, and how their meeting was not just chance, a reference to the \"tree of life\" is made during the song while Madonna makes denouncements of religion by singing \"I'm not religious\" but she wishes to pray. Bill Friskics-Warren, author of I'll Take You There: Pop Music and the Urge for Transcendence, described the lyrics as consisting of double entendre, talking about both spiritual and sexual rebirth. The London Community Gospel Choir, led by Nicki Brown, recorded backing vocals for the song. The strings engineer for the choir, Geoff Foster, recalls that the group consisted of \"a bunch of great singers giving it loudly, it was impressive.\" According to Rolling Stone and The Advocate, the song glides from a lean arrangement and then reaches its peak with the gospel chorus, which resembles that of Madonna's single, \"Like a Prayer\" (1989)."]}, {"page": "Die Another Day (song)", "response": ["After the orchestra sections were done, Ahmadza\u00ef took the track back to his home in Paris and did a complete re-arrangement. String engineer Geoff Foster recalled that Madonna wanted something \"big and brass\" which Ahmadza\u00ef denied, since Madonna had already done that with her 1998 single, \"Frozen\". Colombier explained that the final version was not the way he had structured the song, it was according to Ahmadza\u00ef's mixing and ideas. \"He's a master manipulator. Sixty real strings, played live, became audio files in his computer. They can be chopped like real pieces of fabric. He's amazingly brilliant with that,\" concluded Colombier. Madonna attended the recording sessions at Olympic Studios in London. There was a tango section in the song which Colombier recalled was composed perfectly during rehearsals. But during the actual recording it did not work out as expected, prompting Madonna to grab the talkback mic and telling the crew, \"It's not sexy enough, think about sex!\"", "* Geoff Foster \u2013 strings engineer at AIR Lyndhurst Studios, London"]}, {"page": "Zooma", "response": ["* Geoff Foster \u2013 recording engineer"]}, {"page": "Selmasongs", "response": ["* Geoff Foster - orchestra recording"]}, {"page": "Debravation", "response": ["* Geoff Foster \u2013 sound engineer"]}, {"page": "The Drift", "response": ["*Engineers: Geoff Foster, Peter Walsh"]}, {"page": "From Now On (Will Young album)", "response": ["*Geoff Foster \u2013 engineer"]}, {"page": "Pola X (soundtrack)", "response": ["* Geoff Foster - Mixing"]}, {"page": "Brand New Day (Sting album)", "response": ["* Geoff Foster \u2013 strings engineer (2, 3, 6)"]}, {"page": "The Time of Our Lives (Il Divo and Toni Braxton song)", "response": ["*Geoff Foster \u2013 string engineer"]}, {"page": "The Love Album (Westlife album)", "response": ["*Recorded By [Strings]:Geoff Foster (tracks: 5, 6, 11) Paul Walton (tracks: 2, 7) Rupert Coulson (tracks: 4, 9, 10)"]}, {"page": "Resta in ascolto", "response": ["* Geoff Foster \u2013 string engineer"]}, {"page": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (soundtrack)", "response": ["*Choir Recorded by: Geoff Foster"]}, {"page": "Tolga Kashif", "response": ["Kashif co-wrote the original score for the feature film, The Criminal (2000), with Mark Sayer-Wade, his partner at The Music Sculptors.
