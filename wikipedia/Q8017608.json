Granada Television had commissioned only 13 episodes, and some inside the company doubted the show would last beyond its planned production run.Little. (1995) p.10. Despite the criticism, viewers were immediately drawn into the serial, won over by Coronation Streets ordinary characters.Little. (1995) p. 26. The programme also made use of Northern English language and dialect; affectionate local terms like \"eh, chuck?\", \"nowt\" (, from nought, meaning nothing), and \"by 'eck!\" became widely heard on British television for the first time. Early episodes told the story of student Ken Barlow (William Roache), who had won a place at university, and thus found his working-class background\u2014as well as his younger brother, David (Alan Rothwell) and his parents, Frank (Frank Pemberton) and Ida (Noel Dyson)\u2014something of an embarrassment.TV Times. (1960) p. 8. The character was one of the few to have experienced much of life outside of Coronation Street. In some ways this predicts the growth of globalisation. In an episode from 1961, Barlow declares: \"You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and her boyfriends.\" Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, which makes him the longest-serving actor in Coronation Street, and in British and global soap history.", "Between 1980 and 1989, Coronation Street underwent some of the most radical changes since its launch.

Albert Tatlock's departure came when his character's off screen death was announced several months after the death of actor Jack Howarth at the age of 88. Little. (2000) p.134. and pp.153\u201359. While the press predicted the end of Corrie, H. V. Kershaw declared that \"There are no stars in Coronation Street. The show had also gained a new rival on Channel 4 with the launch of Brookside, and BBC was preparing to launch EastEnders, which would first air in February 1985. \"Tinker. p.62. Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast.Little. (1995) p.172. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock.Little.

The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady.

Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards for his portrayal of Ken.

The storyline continued onto 1983 and became a ratings winner, with the UK's newspapers giving the story much coverage. The episode where Deirdre ends her affair with Mike and reconciles with Ken was the show's highest-rated episode at the time; as such, the news was so big that it ended up being announced on the scoreboard during a Manchester United v Arsenal match at Old Trafford - with the words \"Ken and Deirdre reunited. Ken 1 \u2013 Mike 0\" resulting in cheers from the spectators.", "One major storyline involving Mike came in 1983 when he had an affair with Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride). Before her marriage to Ken Barlow (William Roache), Deirdre had dated Mike, but decided Ken suited her better. When their marriage became jaded, she turned to Mike. After she had confessed everything to Ken, Mike turned up on the doorstep in the hope of taking her away, but she decided to stay with Ken. This event began the long-running feud between Mike and Ken. Mike went on to marry Ken's daughter, Susan Barlow (Wendy Jane Walker), who was many years his junior. This upset Ken further. The marriage failed because Mike and Susan disagreed about their plans for the future. On discovering that Susan was pregnant, Mike wanted her to become a stay-at-home wife and mother but Susan decided to have an abortion, and moved to Newcastle after just a year of marriage.", "Mike and Alma Sedgewick's (Amanda Barrie) romance stemmed back to 1989 and they wed on-screen in 1992, the marriage lasting seven years.

William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, has stated that of all Mike's many women in the serial, he always felt that Alma was Mike's true love, the one that was right and good for him. Briggs has stated that he always enjoyed watching the scenes between Mike and Alma, because Alma knew how to handle Mike. Barrie has discussed the way she approached playing the romance between Mike and Alma, suggesting that as Alma she treated Mike in the same way that she [Barrie] treated Briggs off-set, poking fun at him."]}, {"page": "Audrey Roberts", "response": ["Audrey nearly becomes a victim of her serial killer son-in-law, Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), when he discovers that she is inherited quite a lot of money from Alf.
