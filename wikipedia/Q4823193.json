This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.Playfair, pp. 97\u201398."]}, {"page": "Matthews (surname)", "response": ["* Austin Matthews, cricketer who played for Northamptonshire, Glamorgan and England"]}, {"page": "Cricket in Wales", "response": ["The following Welsh people have played Test cricket for England: Johnnie Clay, Robert Croft, Jeff Jones, Simon Jones, Tony Lewis, Austin Matthews, Hugh Morris, Gilbert Parkhouse, Pat Pocock, Greg Thomas, Matthew Maynard, Maurice Turnbull, Cyril Walters, Steve Watkin and Allan Watkins.", "* Austin Matthews -: He played for Northamptonshire, Glamorgan and single Test for England."]}, {"page": "Austin (given name)", "response": ["*Austin Matthews (1904\u20131997), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Austin Matthews"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Austin Matthews (1937\u20131947) : A.
