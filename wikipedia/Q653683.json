Ike and Tina played to a mixed audience and he deliberately desegregated audiences in the southern states and he wouldn't play to any segregated audiences at all. Because he had such a big band and entourage he desegregated a lot of the hotels because the hotel chains wouldn't want to miss out on the money they would make from him touring the southern states.Turner's songs have been sampled by hip hop artists, most notably Salt-n-Pepa used \"I'm Blue\" for their 1994 hit \"Shoop\".

On the other hand, in an article in the same magazine seven months later which discussed the current top twenty albums on the Billboard chart, Jon Landau dismissed the record as \"a clever novelty\" and said, \"Light, rather showy and cute in places, it probably makes pleasant background music for a dinner or conversation\". Writing for Creem, Robert Christgau was also left unmoved, saying, \"The best I can come up with here is 'pleasant' and 'catchy'.

He wrote that most of the live songs sounded inferior to the original recordings and that the studio tracks were marred by the same flaw as on Wheels of Fire, namely the presence of blues playing on songs whose compositions were not blues in his opinion.

But \"Rocket 88\" does have a couple of elements which \"The Fat Man\" did not. The wailing saxophone and that distorted electric guitar.

He wrote: \"The beautiful thing about it is that although it is a unified set of songs, it is not a rock opera, a concept album, or anything pretending to be much more than a set of good tunes that just happen to fit together.\" In conclusion, he wrote: \"Desperado won't cure your hangover or revalue the dollar, but it will give you many good times. With their second consecutive job well done, the Eagles are on a winning streak.\" Robert Christgau, however, took the view that \"with its barstool-macho equation of gunslinger and guitarschlonger, its on-the-road misogyny, its playing-card metaphors, and its paucity of decent songs, this soundtrack to an imaginary Sam Peckinpah movie is \"concept\" at its most mindless.\" AllMusic editor William Ruhlmann praised that Henley had more involvement with the album, but wrote that it \"was simultaneously more ambitious and serious-minded than its predecessor and also slighter and less consistent.\""]}, {"page": "The Bionic Woman", "response": ["The series proved popular worldwide, particularly so in the United Kingdom, where it was shown on the ITV network and achieved unusually high audience figures for a science fiction show.

Its success continued with a further 10 episodes scoring in the top 20 during 1976. (By contrast, The Six Million Dollar Man never once entered the top 10 rating during its five seasons, though this was most likely because the show was never broadcast across all ITV stations at the same time). The second season also proved popular, with seven episodes finishing in the weekly top 20, the highest of these being the episode The Vega Influence on 12 May 1977, which reached  8 with 14.8 million viewers. The third season was not broadcast simultaneously across all ITV stations in the UK, however, and therefore no episodes reached the weekly Top 20."]}, {"page": "Selling England by the Pound", "response": ["Contemporary reviews for the album were mixed. Rolling Stone's Paul Gambaccini praised the band for attempting something utterly different amidst \"a stagnant pop scene\", but criticised the album's lyrics, feeling they overused British pop culture references, and complained about some musical passages. Despite this, Gambaccini thought the album \"merits some recognition\". NMEs Barbara Charone said the album was \"the band's best, most adventurous album to date\". The Guardians Robin Denselow wrote that \"much of the material is indistinctive and tedious\". Writing for The Village Voice in June 1974, Robert Christgau assessed the record as \"down-to-earth progressive, which means that it indulges in snooty satire about the vulgar futility of working class youth.
