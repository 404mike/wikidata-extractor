She won the gold medal for the 10,000 metres at the 1991 World Championships, and a silver medal over the same distance at the 1988 Olympic Games. She was also a two-time gold medallist over the distance at the Commonwealth Games, as well as winning the 1992 World Half Marathon Championships, 1991 New York City Marathon, 1992 Tokyo Marathon and 1996 London Marathon. Her 10,000 metres best of 30:57.07 set in 1991, moved her to second on the world all-time list at that time and still stands as the Scottish record (as of 2021). Her marathon best of 2:26:52 in 1997, stood as the Scottish record until 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Liz McColgan (born 1964), athlete"]}, {"page": "May 24", "response": ["*1964 \u2013 Liz McColgan, Scottish educator and runner"]}, {"page": "1964", "response": ["* March 24 \u2013 Liz McColgan, British long-distance runner athlete"]}, {"page": "Lisa Opie", "response": ["The British Open also provided much heartbreak.
