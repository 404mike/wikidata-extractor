It is likely that he was the illegitimate son of William Cecil De Vere, a naval officer and son of the second Baronet of Curragh. His mother was Katherine Mathews, a Welsh-born household servant. He played chess effortlessly and elegantly without recourse to chess study or theory; in this respect he was not unlike Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca. His meteoric rise to fame and equally dramatic decline has been compared to Paul Morphy and he is often cited as 'The English Morphy'. His great natural talent for the game was attended by an equal indolence for work. Cecil De Vere contracted tuberculosis around 1867 and later became dependent on alcohol. He lived in London for most of his life but was sent to Torquay by his chess friends in 1874 in the vain hope of recuperation. He died in Torquay, UK, aged 28, and is buried there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wilhelm Steinitz", "response": ["| 1866 || align=left| London handicap tournament|| 1st || 8/9 || align=left | Steinitz won against Cecil Valentine De Vere (2\u20131), MacDonnell (2\u20130), Mocatta (2\u20130) \u2013 Steinitz gave odds of pawn and move, and in the final S.

From 1872 to 1874 the City of London Chess Club contested a two-game correspondence chess match with Vienna: the other London team members eventually dropped out, leaving Potter and Steinitz to continue the match by themselves, which they ultimately won by a score of 1.5\u20130.5. Steinitz would later point to this match as the beginning of the \"systematic analytical development of modern ideas\" in chess.
