The fortnightly Statesman column by John Pilger began in 1991, while Platt was editor, after the two men had worked together on media campaigns against the First Gulf war. Platt, \"while not securing a spectacular turnaround in the merged New Statesman & Society's fortunes... made it once again readable\". Platt was described as \"a propagandist, using New Statesman & Society as a platform for various campaigns against executive abuse of state power\", and was credited for bringing stability to it be staying with it, remaking it in a September 1994 into \"a much glossier magazine with the self-proclaimed 'new politics' of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\".

Following Steve Platt's resignation, Robinson appointed a former editor of The Independent, Ian Hargreaves, on what was at the time an unprecedentedly high salary. Hargreaves fired most of the left-wingers on the staff and turned the Statesman into a strong supporter of Tony Blair's leadership of the Labour Party.", "*Steve Platt (1991\u20131996)"]}, {"page": "Platt (surname)", "response": ["*Steve Platt (fl. 1990s\u20132010s), British journalist, former editor of The New Statesman"]}, {"page": "Wade Deacon High School", "response": ["* Steve Platt, journalist"]}, {"page": "Steve Platt (UK journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steve Platt"]}, {"page": "Longton High School", "response": ["* Steve Platt, Editor 1991\u20131996 of the New Statesman"]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Steve Platt (born 1954) writer and journalist, former editor of the New Statesman."]}, {"page": "Platt, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve Platt"]}]}}
