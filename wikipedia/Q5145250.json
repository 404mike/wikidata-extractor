The King's guards seized Damien, and the King ordered them to hold him but not harm him. The King walked up the steps to his rooms at the Trianon, where he found he was bleeding seriously. He summoned his doctor and a priest, and then fainted.Antoine (1986) page 712-713  Louis was saved from greater harm by the thickness of the winter clothing he was wearing. When the news reached Paris, anxious crowds gathered in the streets.  The Pope, the Empress of Austria, and King George II, with whom France was at war, sent messages hoping for his swift recovery. Damien was tortured to see if he had accomplices, and was tried before the  Parlement of Paris, which had been the most vocal critic of the King.  The Parlement demonstrated its loyalty to the King by sentencing Damiens to the most severe possible penalty; On 28\u201329 March 1757 Damien was executed on the Place de Gr\u00e8ve in Paris by drawing and quartering, following which his body was burned on a bonfire.  The house where he was born was burned down, his father, wife and daughter were banished from France, and his brothers and sisters were required to change their name.Antoine (1997), pages 718\u2013721Colin Jones, The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon (London, 2002), p. 230.", "The financial strain imposed by the wars and excesses of the royal court, and the consequent dissatisfaction with the monarchy, contributed to the national unrest that culminated in the French Revolution of 1789.

Ultimately, he wrote, Louis XV failed to overcome these fiscal problems, mainly because he was incapable of pulling together conflicting parties and interests in his entourage. Although aware of the forces of anti-monarchism threatening his family's rule, he did not do anything to stop them.Jones (2002) p, 124, 132\u201333, 147.", "* Scholarly bibliography by Colin Jones (2002)"]}, {"page": "Affair of the Diamond Necklace", "response": ["* Colin Jones, The Great Nation, 2002, chapter 8.A (Penguin 2003, )"]}, {"page": "Civil Constitution of the Clergy", "response": ["As noted above, the government required all clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.
