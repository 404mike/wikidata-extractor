He is known to have appeared frequently for Surrey and All-England since recorded scorecards first became commonplace in 1772.  He was a genuine all-rounder who was successful as both a batsman and a change bowler.\nWhile playing he lived at Reigate in Surrey.  There has been some confusion in various accounts between him and the similarly named Shock White of Brentford in Middlesex.  The main cause of this confusion was the wide bat controversy which took place on 23\u201324 September 1771, when, \"...one White of Reigate\" tried to use a bat that was fully as wide as the wicket itself.The incident occurred when White was playing for Chertsey versus Hambledon at Laleham Burway.  The Hambledon players not unreasonably objected and a formal protest was made by Thomas Brett, as Hambledon's opening bowler; this was signed by himself, his captain Richard Nyren and master batsman John Small.  The incident brought about a change in the 1774 version of the Laws of Cricket wherein the maximum width of the bat was set at four and one quarter inches.White may have done this with the intention of seeking an unfair advantage or merely as a prank, or possibly even to force the issue in order to get the Laws changed.  Straight bats had replaced the old hockey stick shape a few years earlier (in response to bowlers pitching instead of rolling the ball as formerly) and the width issue may have been rankling.  His motive remains a mystery but the Hambledon objection has been preserved by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).  The Laws were formally changed in 1774.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laws of Cricket", "response": ["In 1771, an incident on the field of play led to the creation of a new Law which remains extant. In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action and so all the Hambledon players could do was register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game's lawmakers that the maximum width of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the maximum width.", "As in 1744, the 1774 code asserted that \"the stumps must be twenty-two inches, the bail six inches long\". There were only two stumps then, with a single bail. At the Artillery Ground on 22 & 23 May 1775, a lucrative single wicket match was played between Five of Kent (with Lumpy Stevens) and Five of Hambledon (with Thomas White).Haygarth, p. 21\u201322. Kent batted first and made 37 to which Hambledon replied with 92, including 75 by John Small. In their second innings, Kent scored 102, leaving Hambledon a target of 48 to win. Small batted last of the Hambledon Five and needed 14 more to win when he went in. He duly scored the runs and Hambledon won by 1 wicket but a great controversy arose afterwards because, three times in the course of his second innings, Small was beaten by Lumpy only for the ball to pass through the two-stump wicket each time without hitting the stumps or the bail.Nyren, p. 156. As a result of Lumpy's protests, the middle stump was introduced, although it was some years before its use became universal.Haygarth, p. 21."]}, {"page": "Thomas White", "response": ["* Thomas White (musician) (born 1984), British musician", "* Thomas White (patriot) (1739\u20131820), American soldier in General Washington's army", "* Thomas White (MP for Rochester), Member of Parliament (MP) for Rochester, 1378\u20131388", "* Thomas White (MP for Leominster), MP for Leominster, 1399", "* Thomas White (MP for Lewes), MP for Lewes, 1420\u20131435", "* Thomas White (died 1542), MP for Bristol", "* Thomas White (died 1558) (1532/4\u20131558), MP for Downton", "* Thomas White (died 1566) (1507\u20131566), MP for Hampshire ", "* Thomas White (died 1590), MP for Poole", "* Thomas White of Tuxford (died 1580), English state official", "* Thomas White (died 1670) (c. 1630\u20131670), Member of Parliament for Wells", "* Thomas White (1667\u20131732), Member of Parliament for East Retford", "* Sir Thomas White, 2nd Baronet (1801\u20131882)", "* Thomas White, 3rd and 5th of the White baronets", "* Thomas White (California politician), mayor of San Jose, California from 1851 to 1854", "* Thomas White Jr. (1939\u20132010), New York politician", "* Thomas White (Michigan politician) (died 1868), Michigan state representative", "* Thomas White (Canadian politician) (1830\u20131888), Canadian politician", "* Thomas White (Australian politician) (1888\u20131957), Australian politician", "* Thomas White (benefactor) (1550\u20131624), clergyman and founder of Sion College", "* Thomas White (scholar) (1593\u20131676), Catholic philosopher", "* Thomas White (bishop) (1628\u20131698), Bishop of Peterborough (1685\u20131690)", "* Thomas White (footballer), English footballer", "* Thomas White (cricketer, born c. 1740) (1740\u20131831), English cricketer for Surrey and Kent", "* Thomas White (Sussex cricketer) (1892\u20131979), English cricketer", "* Thomas White (speed skater) (born 1915), Canadian speed skater", "* Thomas White (merchant) (1492\u20131567), founder of St. John's College, Oxford", "* Thomas White (pirate) (died 1708), English pirate active in the Indian Ocean", "* Thomas White (architect) (died 1738), British architect of St Mary and St Margaret's Church, Castle Bromwich"]}, {"page": "John Small (cricketer)", "response": ["Small was involved in one of the most controversial incidents in early cricket history when Hambledon played Chertsey at Laleham Burway on 23 & 24 September 1771.

In September 1771, when Chertsey played Hambledon at Laleham Burway, Chertsey's Thomas White introduced a bat that was fully as wide as the wicket. He was not actually cheating because there was no limit on bat size at the time, rather he was probably making a point in order to force an issue because straight bats were still new, having been introduced in the 1760s, and it is believed that there was no standard. The Hambledon professionals objected and their senior bowler Thomas Brett wrote out a formal protest that was signed by himself, his captain Richard Nyren and senior batsman John Small, all three being professional players. Brett's action brought about a change in the Laws, as confirmed in 1774, whereby the maximum width of the bat was set at four and one quarter inches. This ruling remains intact. In May 1775, master batsman Small was involved in the incident which resulted in the introduction of the third (middle) stump in the wicket. The wicket in 1775 still consisted of two uprights and a crosspiece, as it had from time immemorial. In a single wicket match played at the Artillery Ground, the great Chertsey bowler Lumpy Stevens (another professional) beat Small at least three times only for the ball to pass through the wicket without disturbing it, and Small won the match for Hambledon. Like Brett before him, Stevens protested and his petition was granted soon afterwards, although research has discovered that the introduction of the third stump in practice was gradual and the two-stump wicket did continue in places for a number of years yet."]}, {"page": "The Cricketers of My Time", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" | Thomas White || align=\"center\" | 14 October 1832 || align=\"right\" | 70"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|Thomas White"]}]}}
