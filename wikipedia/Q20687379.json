These include, among others, the sculptors Ralph Brown, Anthony Caro (in his early work), Robert Clatworthy, Hubert Dalwood, Elisabeth Frink, George Fullard, John Hoskin and Leslie Thornton, and the painter John Berger. The post-War paintings of Francis Bacon and Graham Sutherland share some of the Atomic Age anxieties of the Geometry of Fear sculptors."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2016", "response": ["*Leslie Thornton, 90, English sculptor.Leslie Thornton obituary "]}, {"page": "Leslie Thornton", "response": ["Leslie Thornton may refer to:", "*Leslie Thornton (filmmaker) (born 1951), American filmmaker", "*Leslie Thornton (sculptor) (1925\u20132016), British sculptor"]}]}}
