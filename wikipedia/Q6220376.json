John Baker, Bishop of Salisbury, stated in his diocesan newsletter that he had been asked about the appropriateness of the white poppy. Baker responded \"let's not be hurt if we see a white poppy...there is plenty of space for red and white to bloom side by side.\" Salisbury MP Robert Key disagreed, and later that year asked British prime minister Margaret Thatcher her opinion on the issue. Thatcher expressed her \"deep distaste\" for the symbol during prime minister's questions. In response, the White Poppy campaign received much media coverage in Britain. The Daily Star ran several articles criticising the White Poppy campaign. In The Guardian, artist Steve Bell published a cartoon satirising Thatcher's opposition to white poppies, which he allowed the Peace Pledge Union to republish."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Salisbury", "response": ["| 60px John Baker"]}]}}
