It began with a concert at the Peoples' Gymnasium in Beijing in front of 12,000 people. They also played a concert in front of 5,000 in Canton. The two concerts were played without compensation.

She attended Holland Park School, where she excelled at sports, including the 400 metres. She was also a member of the England under-19 volleyball team. Following a spell as a catwalk model, she scored a number of club hits after recording with the group The Biz in 1983. Her first commercial success came in early 1988, when she sang on Coldcut's \"Doctorin' the House\". She soon launched a solo career on Big Life records, a label set up by her husband Jazz Summers, releasing her debut solo single, \"The Only Way Is Up\", in the summer of 1988. It went on to spend five weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, eventually becoming the second-biggest-selling UK single of the year. Her follow-up \"Stand Up for Your Love Rights\" was another big hit (UK number 2),) while her debut album Wanted (UK number 3) was certified double platinum in the UK in September 1989 for sales exceeding 600,000."]}, {"page": "Simon Napier-Bell", "response": ["Napier-Bell then established an association with manager Jazz Summers and together they took on the management of Wham!. The group had previously had three hit singles in the UK but wanted to terminate their contract with the record company, Innervision. Napier-Bell and Summers led them through four months of legal complications (during which they were unable to record), and finally settled the case by signing a new contract with CBS. Napier-Bell spent eighteen months travelling backwards and forwards to China negotiating for Wham! to become the first ever Western pop artist to play in communist China. They eventually played a concert there in April 1985 at the Worker's Stadium in Beijing."]}, {"page": "The Good Will Out", "response": ["\"You've Got to Say Yes\" was about Heaton's best friend Dean who had an \"incredibly tough life\", and was influenced by the work of Curtis Mayfield. Initially, the song was called \"Shallow Time\", had a saxophone, and a section in 6/8 time. For \"Fireworks\", Danny McNamara sang a soul-esque rendition, before they added their instruments. The intro to \"The Last Gas\" is a snippet from a radio show about orangutans; it includes shouting by the Bricklayers. The album's final three tracks are piano-led pieces: \"That's All Changed Forever\", \"Now You're Nobody\" and \"The Good Will Out\". \"That's All Changed Forever\" was influenced by McNamara falling in love, and the effects love has on a person's life. The chorus was inspired after the band saw Superstar, who had a song with a similar sound. The lyrics include a reference to a conversation McNamara and Dale had at Heaton's house in 1995. With \"Now You're Nobody\", Dale said the band took a \"very Pet Sounds approach\", like quieting the drum and bass parts, and adding a lot of reverb. Richard McNamara said they dismantled a music box to sample its notes for the song. \"The Good Will Out\" was the result of combining two separate songs, and is reminiscent of \"Hey Jude\" (1968) by the Beatles. It had a verse from a different song initially, which Jazz Summers said needed re-working. They re-wrote the verse and eventually had the song's final form. Discussing the closing \"la-la-la\" section, McNamara said it was the \"most emotional moment during the recording [...] Think about it, everyone understands La-la-la\"."]}, {"page": "Damage (British group)", "response": ["The band was formed by Rahsaan \"Ras\" Bromfield and Noel Simpson who were students at the Barbara Speake Stage School in the London neighbourhood of Acton.

Andrez Harriott, a student at Sylvia Young Theatre School, was recruited after he and Jones performed together in the musical play Carmen Jones. Core\u00e9 Richards was asked to join the band after he was heard singing at a bus stop. The band sent a demo tape of a cover version of the Jackson 5 song \"Anything\" to Jazz Summers of Big Life Records in early 1995. Damage made inroads into the UK Singles Chart and the second single \"Love II Love\" reached number 12 while the follow-up, \"Forever\", charted at number 6 during the Christmas period. \"Forever\" was also notable for being both the first song that Steve Mac and Wayne Hector wrote together, and the song that caught the ear of Simon Cowell and effectively led to Mac becoming the chief songwriter-producer for Cowell's subsequent projects."]}, {"page": "Big Life", "response": ["Big Life was a record label established in 1987 by Jazz Summers and Tim Parry.
