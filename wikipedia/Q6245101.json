He served on a number of ships during the War of the Austrian Succession, seeing action at both the First and Second Battles of Cape Finisterre, having by then risen to the rank of lieutenant. He had his own commands by the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, and enjoyed particular success as a frigate captain, cruising against privateers while in command of HMS Tartar. Further commands followed, including roles in detached squadrons at the Battle of Quiberon Bay. Taking the additional name Ross after he inherited a deceased relative's estates, he served as a member of parliament and undertook land reforms and improvements during the years of peace before the outbreak of the American War of Independence.\nLockhart-Ross returned to sea on the outbreak of war, commanding a ship at the Battle of Ushant, and later being promoted to flag rank. He served in several actions as a junior commander of Rodney's fleet, including the capture of the Caracas convoy, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and the relief of Gibraltar. He then retired ashore, devoting himself to his estates until his death in 1790.
