The mechanism of pancreatic secretion. J Physiol 1902;28:325\u2013352. The same response could be produced by injecting extract of jejunum mucosa into the jugular vein, showing that some factor in the mucosa was responsible. They named this substance \"secretin\" and coined the term hormone for chemicals that act in this way."]}, {"page": "Hormone", "response": ["William Bayliss and Ernest Starling, a physiologist and biologist, respectively, wanted to see if the nervous system had an impact on the digestive system. They knew that the pancreas was involved in the secretion of digestive fluids after the passage of food from the stomach to the intestines, which they believed to be due to the nervous system. They cut the nerves to the pancreas in an animal model and discovered that it was not nerve impulses that controlled secretion from the pancreas. It was determined that a factor secreted from the intestines into the bloodstream was stimulating the pancreas to secrete digestive fluids. This factor was named secretin: a hormone, although the term hormone was not coined until 1905 by Starling."]}, {"page": "Signal transduction", "response": ["The earliest notion of signal transduction can be traced back to 1855, when Claude Bernard proposed that ductless glands such as the spleen, the thyroid and adrenal glands, were responsible for the release of \"internal secretions\" with physiological effects.Bradshaw & Dennis (2010) p. 1. Bernard's \"secretions\" were later named \"hormones\" by Ernest Starling in 1905. Together with William Bayliss, Starling had discovered secretin in 1902. Although many other hormones, most notably insulin, were discovered in the following years, the mechanisms remained largely unknown."]}, {"page": "University College London", "response": ["Hormones were first discovered at UCL by William Bayliss and Ernest Starling, the former also an alumnus of UCL."]}, {"page": "Enteric nervous system", "response": ["Peristalsis is a series of radially symmetrical contractions and relaxations of muscles which propagate down a muscular tube.  In humans and other mammals, peristalsis is found in the smooth muscles of the digestive tract to propel contents through the digestive system.  The word is derived from New Latin and comes from the Greek peristallein, \"to wrap around,\" from peri-, \"around\" + stallein, \"to place\".  Peristalsis was discovered in 1899 by the work of physiologists William Bayliss and Ernest Starling.  Working on the small intestines of dogs, they found that the response of increasing the pressure in the intestine caused the contraction of the muscle wall above the point of stimulation and the relaxation of the muscle wall below the point of stimulation."]}, {"page": "Secretin", "response": ["Secretin was the first hormone to be identified. In 1902, William Bayliss and Ernest Starling were studying how the nervous system controls the process of digestion. It was known that the pancreas secreted digestive juices in response to the passage of food (chyme) through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum. They discovered (by cutting all the nerves to the pancreas in their experimental animals) that this process was not, in fact, governed by the nervous system. They determined that a substance secreted by the intestinal lining stimulates the pancreas after being transported via the bloodstream. They named this intestinal secretion secretin. Secretin was the first such \"chemical messenger\" identified. This type of substance is now called a hormone, a term coined by Starling in 1905."]}, {"page": "Henry Hallett Dale", "response": ["Henry Hallett Dale was born in Islington, London, to Charles James Dale, a pottery manufacturer from Staffordshire, and his wife, Frances Anne Hallett, daughter of a furniture manufacturer, from South Devon.Feldberg W, rev.

Henry was the third of seven children, one of whom (his younger brother, Benjamin Dale) became an accomplished composer and warden of the Royal Academy of Music.  Henry was educated at the local Tollington Park College and then The Leys School Cambridge (one of the school's houses is named after him) and in 1894 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, working under the physiologist John Langley. For a few months in 1903 he also studied under Paul Ehrlich in Frankfurt, Germany. Also in 1903, Dale assisted Ernest Starling and William Bayliss in the vivisection of a dog, by removing the dog's pancreas and then killing the dog with a knife, which ultimately led to the events of the Brown Dog affair. Dale received his Doctor of Medicine degree from Cambridge in 1909."]}, {"page": "1902 in science", "response": ["* William Bayliss and Ernest Starling make the first discovery of a hormone, secretin."]}, {"page": "Ernest Starling", "response": ["He made at least four significant contributions: 1. In the capillary, water is forced out through the pores in the wall by hydrostatic pressure and driven in by the osmotic pressure of plasma proteins (or oncotic pressure). These opposing forces approximately balance; which is known as Starling's Principle. 2. The discovery of the hormone secretinwith his brother-in-law William Baylissand the introduction of the word hormone. 3. The analysis of the heart's activity as a pump, which is known as the Frank\u2013Starling law. 4. Several fundamental observations on the action of the kidneys. These include evidence for the existence of vasopressin, the anti-diuretic hormone. He also wrote the leading textbook of physiology in English, which ran through 20 editions.", "Starling enjoyed collaborating with William Bayliss (1860\u20131924), who was on the staff of University College London (UCL), and together they published on the electrical activity of the heart and on peristalsis. In 1891, when he was 25, Starling married Florence Amelia Wooldridge, the widow of Leonard Charles Wooldridge, who had been his physiology teacher at Guy's and died at the age of 32. She was a great support to Starling as a sounding board, secretary, and manager of his affairs as well as mother of their four children. In 1893 Bayliss married Gertrude, Starling's beautiful sister, so the two were brothers-in-law. When Starling was appointed professor at UCL in 1899, the scientific family was even closer. Bayliss and Starling were in the newspaper's headlines when involved in the Brown Dog affair, a controversy relating to vivisection.Henderson, 2005, pp.62\u201368."]}, {"page": "Walter Bradford Cannon", "response": [":As a military physician in World War I he discovered that the blood of shocked men was acidic. As a member of the British Medical Research Council's Special Committee on Shock and Allied Conditions, he advocated treating shocked wounded by infusing sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the acid.  He and William Bayliss infused acid into an anesthetized cat, which died. However, a second trial done with Bayliss and Henry Dale failed to produce shock. Shock was successfully treated by infusing saline containing some larger molecules."]}]}}
