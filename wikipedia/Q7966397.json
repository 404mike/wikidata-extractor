(a greeting to a dour clown sitting disconsolate with his dog) in 1893. And the Pierrot of popular taste also spawned a uniquely English entertainment. In 1891, the singer and banjoist Clifford Essex, inspired by Michel Carr\u00e9 fils' pantomime L'Enfant prodigue (Pierrot the Prodigal [1890]), which he had seen at the Prince of Wales' Theatre in London,\"Pierrot Hero: The Memoirs of Clifford Essex.\" resolved to create a troupe of English Pierrot entertainers. Thus were born the seaside Pierrots (in conical hats and sometimes black or colored costume) who, as late as the 1950s, sang, danced, juggled, and joked on the piers of Brighton and Margate and Blackpool.See Calvert, Pertwee. Obviously inspired by these troupes were the Will Morris Pierrots, named after their Birmingham founder. They originated in the Smethwick area in the late 1890s and played to large audiences in many parks, theaters, and pubs in the Midlands. It was doubtless these popular entertainers who inspired the academic Walter Westley Russell to commit The Pierrots (c. 1900) to canvas."]}, {"page": "Bernard Hailstone", "response": ["After education at the Judd School, Tonbridge, Hailstone attended Goldsmiths' College of Art, under James Bateman, then the Royal Academy Schools, under Walter Westley Russell."]}, {"page": "Forest Gate", "response": ["Artists from Forest Gate include Betsy Schneider, John Bowstead, Walter Westley Russell and Barry Windsor-Smith.

Henry Tonks, Walter Westley Russell and Ambrose McEvoy taught her drawing, while Philip Wilson Steer lectured her in painting. It seems that she never painted during her time at the Slade, instead concentrating her efforts on drawing of portraiture and figure studies.

Evelyn Cheston first exhibited with the New English Art Club in 1906 and became a member in 1909. She fell ill with Bright's disease which left her disabled but she continued to paint, often outdoors and usually in her signature vivid style.
