With Rangers controlling the majority of the play throughout the match, Forster was called into action on many occasions. On 14 minutes, Ryan Jack struck a powerful 22-yard shot towards the top right of Celtic's goal, but Forster saved it at full stretch with his left palm. He made several other saves during the first half to keep Celtic level. Into the second half, a low ball was played from the left by Rangers across the Celtic goal; Joe Aribo looked set to tap it in at the far post, but Forster got a foot on it to clear. Rangers were awarded a penalty on 64 minutes: Alfredo Morelos took the kick for Rangers, but Forster dived low to his right to block it with his arms. Celtic won 1\u20130, and Forster was named Player of the Match. Manager Neil Lennon commented that \"I've not seen a goalkeeping performance or goalkeeper like Fraser for a long time. In his first spell here, he did some incredible things and now he's doing it again in his second\", adding that several of his saves were \"world class\"."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 in Scottish reserve and youth football", "response": ["|Ryan Jack, Gordon Dick, James Keatings", "|Gordon Dick (2), Ryan Jack"]}, {"page": "Shaun Hutchinson", "response": ["In the 2013\u201314 season, Hutchinson started his season when he was booked in both legs, as Motherwell lost 3\u20130 to Kuban Krasnodar on aggregate.
