The officers received training in London, most likely under the supervision of Special Branch, which had been part of Britain's Directorate of Home Intelligence since February 1919. They may also have received some training from MI5 officers and former officers working for Special Branch. Army Centre in Dublin hoped these officers could eventually be divided up and deployed to the provinces to support its 5th and 6th Division intelligence staff, but it decided to keep the unit in Dublin, at the Dublin District Division, commanded by General Gerald Boyd. It was known officially as the Dublin District Special Branch (DDSB) and also as \"D Branch\". In May 1920, Lieutenant Colonel Walter Wilson arrived in Dublin to take command of D Branch."]}, {"page": "Gerald Boyd", "response": ["Gerald Boyd may refer to:", "* Gerald Boyd (British Army officer) (1877\u20131930)"]}, {"page": "Gerald Farrell Boyd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerald Boyd (British Army officer)"]}]}}
