She principally wrote fantasy and speculative fiction novels for children and young adults. Although usually described as fantasy, some of her work also incorporates science fiction themes and elements of realism. Jones' work often explores themes of time travel and parallel or multiple universes. Some of her better-known works are the Chrestomanci series, the Dalemark series, the three Moving Castle novels, Dark Lord of Derkholm, and The Tough Guide to Fantasyland.\nJones has been cited as an inspiration and muse for several fantasy and science fiction authors including Philip Pullman, Terry Pratchett, Penelope Lively, Robin McKinley, Dina Rabinovitch, Megan Whalen Turner, J.K. Rowling and Neil Gaiman, with Gaiman describing her as \"quite simply the best writer for children of her generation\". Her work has been nominated for several awards. She was twice a finalist for the Hugo Award, nominated fourteen times for the Locus Award, seven times for the Mythopoeic Award (which she won twice), twice for a British Fantasy Award (won in 1999), and twice for a World Fantasy Award, which she would also win in 2007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Actaeon", "response": ["*Actaeon and his dogs make an appearance in Diana Wynne Jones's novel The Game, in which the main character encounters various mythological figures while wandering the mythosphere."]}, {"page": "August 16", "response": ["*  1934   \u2013 Diana Wynne Jones, English author (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "J.
