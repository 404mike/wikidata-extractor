He has founded five summer fiddling programs: the Valley of the Moon fiddle camp in California (begun in 1984), Alasdair Fraser Skye Week - a week-long course on the Isle of Skye (begun in 1987),  Sierra Fiddle Camp in California (begun in 2006), Crisol de Cuerda, a Trad strings program in Spain begun in 2008 and Stringmania! - a trad strings program in Australia in 2016. Adept in various Scottish idioms, in recent years, with cellist Natalie Haas, he has helped reconstruct and revive the Scottish tradition of playing traditional music on violin and cello (\"wee fiddle\" and \"big fiddle\"). Fraser lives in northern California with his wife and two sons.In December 2011, Fraser was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fiddle", "response": ["Fiddling is the act of playing the fiddle, and fiddlers are musicians that play it. Among musical styles, fiddling tends to produce rhythms that focus on dancing, with associated quick note changes, whereas classical music tends to contain more vibrato and sustained notes. Fiddling is also open to improvisation and embellishment with ornamentation at the player's discretion, in contrast to orchestral performances, which adhere to the composer's notes to reproduce a work faithfully. It is less common for a classically trained violinist to play folk music, but today, many fiddlers (e.g., Alasdair Fraser, Brittany Haas, Alison Krauss) have classical training.", "In the very late 20th century, a few artists have successfully attempted a reconstruction of the Scottish tradition of violin and \"big fiddle,\" or cello.
