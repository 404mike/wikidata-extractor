Enrolled as a gentleman-commoner, he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers. Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the greatest advantage of his time there was in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, always encouraged him, as did a young senior tutor, Henry Liddell (later the father of Alice Liddell) and a private tutor, the Rev Osborne Gordon.Cynthia Gamble, John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3\u20134. He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, William Buckland. Among his fellow-undergraduates, Ruskin's most important friends were Charles Thomas Newton and Henry Acland.", "Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti. He also provided an annuity of \u00a3150 in 1855\u201357 to Elizabeth Siddal, Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of Henry Acland for her medical care).ODNB: \"Critic of Contemporary Art\". Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including John Brett, John William Inchbold, and Edward Burne-Jones, who became a good friend (he called him \"Brother Ned\").W. G. Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin (Methuen, 1900) p. 402. His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.", "Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the Gothic style. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive \"Ruskinian Gothic\".J. Mordaunt Crook, \"Ruskinian Gothic\", in The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin, ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65\u201393. Through his friendship with Henry Acland, Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the Oxford University Museum of Natural History (designed by Benjamin Woodward)\u2014which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed to satisfy Ruskin completely. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.Michael Brooks, John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.", "In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from Switzerland to Turin, where he saw Paolo Veronese's Presentation of the Queen of Sheba. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his \"unconversion\" from Evangelical Christianity. He had, however, doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, shaken by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:Michael Wheeler, Ruskin's God (Cambridge University Press, 1999) . \"those dreadful hammers!\" he wrote to Henry Acland, \"I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses.\" This \"loss of faith\" precipitated a considerable personal crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths. He later returned to Christianity.", "Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford University in August 1869, though largely through the offices of his friend, Henry Acland.Tim Hilton, John Ruskin: The Later Years (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165\u201368.

After Sarah Acland's death her friends decided that an institution for nurses would be an appropriate way to memorialize her, and they solicited donations and collected GBP4,000 from members of the community. Work began quickly and a district nurse associated with the new institution was out working in the field a few weeks after the project began. In 1879 a meeting was held announcing the \"Sarah Acland Institution for Nurses\", which was initially situated at 37 Wellington Square, Oxford and was supervised by Mrs Rutherford Smith. The new buildings for the Sarah Acland Home were opened on 12 May 1879 by then-Prince of Wales and later King of the United Kingdom, George V.

The 1984 book The History of the University of Oxford lists the official foundation of the Acland Nursing Home as 1882, and describes it as a \"leading institution\" of Oxford, which had close ties to Oxford University.

The memorial to his wife could have assumed no form more acceptable to him.\" Atlay wrote in the 1903 work: \"The 'Sarah Acland Home' is now one of the most flourishing and valued institutions in Oxford.
