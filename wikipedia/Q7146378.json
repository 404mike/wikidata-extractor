While Barbour has often been credited as being 'the first Labour woman councillor in Glasgow', this is not the case. Barbour was one of a pioneering group of five women who were elected in 1920 which included Eleanor Stewart (Maryhill) as the other Labour woman councillor, and Jessica Baird-Smith, Mary Bell and Mary Anderson Snodgrass all respectively elected as Moderate councillors. It would appear that the misconception about Barbour being the \"first Labour woman councillor\" originated in Patrick Dollan's book about the Kinning Park Co-operative Society, published in 1923. While standing for election, Barbour stated that \"the advent of a woman candidate was seen by some men and women as outrageous\", but contended that women councillors were needed to tackle issues that affected women and children."]}, {"page": "Ayr Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["thumb|120px|Patrick Dollan"]}, {"page": "Dollan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Patrick Dollan"]}, {"page": "Dollan Baths", "response": ["Designed by Alexander Buchanan Campbell and named after former Lord Provost Sir Patrick Dollan, it was opened in 1968 as Scotland's first 50-metre (although not Olympic standard) swimming pool.

This came to a head after the Labour Party refused to endorse ILP candidates at the 1931 general election.  Several leading Scottish members disagreed with the ILP's moves to disaffiliate, including chairman of the Scottish ILP Patrick Dollan, David Kirkwood, who was one of the party's five MPs, and former MP Tom Johnston.  They formed the Scottish Independent Labour Party Affiliation Committee in 1932, campaigning to reverse the policy.  However, this open opposition to a key party policy was not accepted by the majority in the ILP, and the three were expelled in mid-August.  They formed the Scottish Socialist Party at the end of the month, and were immediately successful in affiliating it to the Labour Party.  The new party initially claimed to have 1,000 members, and by November, it claimed 2,200.  This compared with 3,300 Scottish ILP members before the split.James Jupp, The Radical Left in Britain: 1931-1941, p.47"]}, {"page": "Aitken Ferguson", "response": ["At the 1924 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election, Ferguson stood again.  The Independent Labour Party opposed his candidacy, initially championing Patrick Dollan as a possible Labour candidate, but Dollan withdrew his name, and on this occasion, Ferguson became the official Labour candidate.  However, Arthur Henderson objected to an advert in Workers Weekly, the CPGB newspaper, asking for donations for Ferguson's campaign, and setting out  radical policies.  Official sponsorship was not withdrawn, but Ferguson received no practical support from the national Labour Party.

The organisation became a driving force in supporting the 1915 rent strike, and its formation has been described as the major 'pre-war organizational effort' in support of the strikes. In 1915 the Glasgow Women's Housing Association organised a number of meetings in Morris Hall on Shaw Street in Govan to protest rent increases across Glasgow. The first of these meetings, on 16 February, was chaired by Laird and addressed by John S. Taylor, Patrick Dollan and Harry Hopkins. Laird also played a prominent part in another meeting which took place in St Mungo's Halls. In her role as Chair of the Glasgow Women's Housing Association, Laird criticised tenement housing, stating that these were a challenge for housewives, advocating instead the establishment of  \"cottage homes\"."]}, {"page": "Arthur Brady (politician)", "response": ["With Patrick Dollan and a number of ILP Members of Parliament, Brady founded the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP), which sought to continue ILP policies while re-affiliating to the Labour Party.
