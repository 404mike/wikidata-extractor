In spite of his music being both pleasant and catchy, few of his compositions were recorded (with the exception of \"I'm on a See-Saw\" by Fats Waller and \"This is My Lovely Day\" by Lizbeth Webb and Georges Guetary), so his name became less well known after his last London production.

One of Webb's songs with Gu\u00e9tary, \"This Is My Lovely Day\", became one of the BBC's most requested songs of all times, and the song's popularity, and that of the show, were increased by their association with the wedding in 1947 of Princess Elizabeth and Lt.
