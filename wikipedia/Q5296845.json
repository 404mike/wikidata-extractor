With the constituency overwhelmingly Protestant the SDLP had no chance of winning and much of the spotlight on them concerned their electoral battle with Sinn F\u00e9in as a prelude to forthcoming Assembly elections. Sinn F\u00e9in had no Assembly members but ran Martin Meehan, who had been their sole Assembly candidate the last time, in the hope of increasing his profile and building up their local organisation in preparation for a shot at the next election. The battle between McClelland and Meehan attracted much attention as it would indicate the movement of votes within the nationalist community between the two parties, though most agreed that it was always likely for the SDLP to come out on top in the highly middle-class constituency."]}, {"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Donovan McClelland", "|Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|Donovan McClelland", "|Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "1949 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*14 January \u2013 Donovan McClelland, Social Democratic and Labour Party politician."]}, {"page": "South Antrim (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=2|Donovan McClelland(SDLP)", "| style=\"text-align:right;\"|Donovan McClellandBobby BurnsTommy McTeagueBobby LoughranOran Keenan"]}, {"page": "Noreen McClelland", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Donovan McClelland  31 January 2000 \u2013 7 May 2007 "]}, {"page": "2005 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "2001 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "1997 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "1993 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "1989 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "2011 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Donovan McClelland"]}, {"page": "2000 MI6 attack", "response": ["A by-election in the constituency of South Antrim was scheduled to be held the day after the attack.
