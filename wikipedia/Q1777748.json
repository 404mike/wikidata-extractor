It is in that decade when Europe and the United States became aware of art made in Africa by individual artists, thus breaking with the colonial tradition of assuming collective \"ethnic\" origins of so-called \"tribal art\" as found in most ethnographic collections.Firstenberg (2003). \"Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art\", in Farrell and Byvanck (eds), Looking Both Ways, pp. 37-41. The exhibition Magiciens de la terre by Jean-Hubert Martin in 1989 is widely considered (but also challenged as) a key exhibition in this very recent history of international reception of African and other non-western art.  However, this reception, too, has its roots in an exotic and mystifying view on African culture from a dominant western position, as Rasheed Araeen argued in his response to Magiciens de la terre.Araeen, Rasheed (1989). \"Our Bauhaus Others' Mudhouse\", Third Text no. 6, pp. 3\u201316.See also Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). \"Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art \u2013 Production, Exhibition, Commodification\", in Farrell, L.

These dichotomies tend to consider mutual influences in African and European art as an exception rather than the norm. Even more, they fail to think of African art independent from Europe as its counterpart or \"influence\", resulting in a frequent reproach of African artists \"copycatting\" or \"mimicking\" European achievements of modernism.Oguibe, Olu (1999). \"Art, Identity, Boundaries: Postmodernism and Contemporary African Art\", in Oguibe, O., and O.

There she introduced Mancoba to Asger Jorn who was a part of the Host Artist's Association and a founding member of Cobra. For the next annual exhibition (1948), Asger Jorn invited Mancoba and Ferlov to attend and meet two other Cobra artists; Constant Nievwenhuys and Corneille Guillaume Beverloo (most commonly known under his pseudonym Corneille). The exhibition came to be known by art historians to be the first Cobra exhibition since the CobrA manifesto had been written and signed several days before. The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam hosted Constant and Corneille's Cobra exhibition called the \u201cExposition Internationale d\u2019 Art Experimental, in 1949. Constant and Corneille invited seven other Danish Artist, including Mancoba who did not participate. Due to his absence, Mancoba wasn't listed within the exhibition's catalogue and perhaps resulted in his exclusion from the list of Cobra artists. Although no known reason stands for Mancoba and why he didn't participate, personal complications between members may have had an impact on his involvement with the group.
