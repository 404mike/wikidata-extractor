Philosophy 1932 (tr. Ashton E.B., University of Chicago Press, 1970) pp.117ff This pattern of three primary and three secondary categories was used most notably in the nineteenth century by Peter Mark Roget to form the six headings of his Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases. The headings used were the three objective categories of Abstract Relation, Space (including Motion) and Matter and the three subjective categories of Intellect, Feeling and Volition, and he found that under these six headings all the words of the English language, and hence any possible predicate, could be assembled.Roget P.M.

Four years later Peter Mark Roget offered an explanation when reading at the Royal Society on December 9, 1824. He added: \"It is also to be noticed that, however rapidly the wheel revolves, each individual spoke, during the moment it is viewed, appears to be at rest.\" Roget claimed that the illusion is due to the fact \"that an impression made by a pencil of rays on the retina, if sufficiently vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has ceased.\" He also provided mathematical details about the appearing curvatures.", "As a university student Joseph Plateau noticed in some of his early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels which turned fast in opposite directions, it produced the optical illusion of a motionless wheel.
