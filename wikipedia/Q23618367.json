Michael Lipper, who had been the one to propose Coughlan as Mayor in '69, was chosen as a Labour candidate for the 1973 general election in Limerick and served as a rallying point for Anti-Coughlan labour members. Although Lipper was not successful, he performed much better than expected and demonstrated the scales were beginning to tip against Coughlan. The 1977 general election pitted Coughlan directly against Lipper when Lipper choose to run as an Independent. When all the votes were counted, Coughlan lost his seat to Lipper aided by the fact the Bishop of Limerick Jeremiah Newman threw his support behind Lipper, something that deeply annoyed Coughlan. Lipper was quickly readmitted back into Labour following the election as the Labour party itself saw that Coughlan was done for. In response, in April 1979 Coughlan and his son, also named Stephan Coughlan, both quit the Labour party, with Stephen senior effectively retiring from politics."]}, {"page": "Kevin McNamara (bishop)", "response": ["In office, McNamara and the neighbouring Bishop of Limerick, Jeremiah Newman, became the most outspoken conservative voices in the Irish hierarchy.
