He succeeded his father in the business in 1777. His family seat was Abington Hall in Abington Magna outside Cambridge.\nIn 1778 Mortlock bought himself the Freedom of Cambridge for \u00a340. In 1780 he founded the first bank in Cambridge. Mortlock's bank, which was originally situated on the corner of Rose Crescent and then moved to Bene't Street, would be run by members of the Mortlock family for over one hundred years. In 1896 the bank was amalgamated with Barclays & Co. In 1782 he became an alderman, then mayor and, in 1784, the Member of Parliament for Cambridge.Mortlock, who was a great friend and supporter of Pitt the Younger, was called corrupt by his political opponents, though as the plaque suggests he had a different view of things:\"without influence, which you call corruption, men will not be induced to support government, though they generally approve of its measures\".In 1792 he was appointed to the lucrative post of Receiver General of the Post Office, a position he held until 1806.\n\nHe died in 1816. He had married Elizabeth, the daughter of grocer Stephen Harrison, and with her had eight sons and two daughters. A son, John Cheetham Mortlock, was knighted. A grandson John Frederick Mortlock wrote an account of his transportation to Australia and another grandson Frederick William Mortlock worked in customs in Jamaica.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Mortlock", " By-election triggered by the appointment of John Mortlock to office.

He invited his friend and former co-working artist from the Cambrian Pottery, Thomas Pardoe, to aid him with the completion and decoration of the salvaged porcelain. Young and Pardoe experimented to perfect a glaze for the biscuit ware, but were unable to add to Billingsley's stockpile of porcelain, having no access to his recipe. The final sales of the finished porcelain (sold between 1821 and 1822), paid Pardoe and his staff's salaries in arrears, but failed to recoup Young's total losses, leaving Young narrowly avoiding bankruptcy. Besides the porcelain decorated by Young, but predominantly by Pardoe at Nantgarw, many pieces were sold in the white to be decorated in London. These wares are known to have been decorated by Thomas Martin Randall (working for John Mortlock at the time),  John Latham, William Peg and probably Matthew Colclough."]}, {"page": "Mortlock", "response": ["*John Mortlock (1755\u20131816), British banker and politician"]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Cambridge", "response": ["*c.1780: John Mortlock, MP for Cambridge, 1784"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain by-elections (1774\u20131790)", "response": ["|29 May 1788||Cambridge||u*||John Mortlock||Francis Dickins||Resignation"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1784 British general election", "response": ["| John Mortlock \u2013 resigned  Replaced by Francis Dickins 1788"]}, {"page": "Mortlock, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Mortlock"]}, {"page": "Black people in Cambridge", "response": ["The abolitionist cause was taken up by a network of evangelical clergy and others with Cambridge connections.
