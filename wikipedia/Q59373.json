Exeter opened the scoring after fifteen minutes through Richard Logan, before Stevenage equalised on the hour mark \u2014 Robin Shroot scoring his second goal in as many games as he finished neatly from substitute Jennison Myrie-Williams' cross. A third successive draw followed a week later when Stevenage drew 2\u20132 at home with Chesterfield. The visitors opened the scoring after twelve minutes when Neal Trotman headed in Drew Talbot's cross. Chesterfield doubled their advantage ten minutes later when Jordan Bowery capitalised a defensive mix-up to curl in a shot from the edge of the area. Stevenage scored two goals within the space of two second-half minutes to draw level. Firstly, Scott Laird prodded home Joel Byrom's corner to half the deficit, before Laird fired in a cross that was neatly turned in by Craig Reid. Stevenage then faced a home game against Oldham Athletic on 13 March. The original game, scheduled to be played in February, was postponed due to adverse weather conditions. Stevenage won the game 1\u20130, courtesy of an injury-time header from Lawrie Wilson. Wilson connected with a low Darius Charles cross in the last minute of the match to give the home side their first league win in five outings."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["|1 ||FW || ||21 ||Jordan Bowery || 8 || 1 || 0 || 3 || 12", "|Jordan Bowery"]}]}}
