Fowler retired from UCL in 1909.\nIn retirement Fowler lived at Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire, and his interests turned to local history. He established the Bedfordshire Historical Record Society in 1912 and the Bedfordshire Record Office in 1913, continuing to serve as chairman of the county records committee until 1940.During World War I he worked in hydrographic and naval intelligence, preparing charts for use by submarines.

To some extent it was operating within established traditions set by the London-based Public Record Office (now The National Archives), which first opened in 1838, or by other repositories overseas. Although the statutory operation of such county record offices under the Local Government (Records) Act 1962 was permissive rather than mandatory, the network has gradually expanded. Bristol Record Office (now Bristol Archives), opened in 1924, has been identified as the second local office to become established. The whole network now includes repositories \u2013 which operate largely independently of each other \u2013 throughout the whole of England and Wales (the most recent being Powys Archives, opened in the 1980s). Often the foundations of many of the earlier collections were the extensive surviving archives originating from a county's quarter sessions \u2013 in the county of Somerset a special muniment room had actually been provided for these as early as 1617. There are also many broadly similar repositories in Scotland, Ireland, and overseas. To varying extents they will also help with the care of the county's semi-current or \"modern records\" using records management principles, as well as with the selection and preservation of today's records (both paper and digital) for future generations."]}, {"page": "1918 New Year Honours", "response": ["*George Herbert Fowler, Hydrographic Dept., Admiralty"]}]}}
