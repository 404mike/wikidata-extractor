He exhibited an interest in political philosophy and attended lectures at the university of Edinburgh where he befriended John Black who, at the time, was also a student at the university. Later, Mudford published a series of letters exchanged with Black in William Cobbett's Political Register. The letters centred around a debate about classical education. In the exchanges, Mudford had argued against the merits of classical education, while Black supported the opposite side. In 1810 Mudford published a series of essays under the title The Contemplatist, which were originally published in instalments in a weekly periodical under the same title.

Departing from the Chronicle he was employed first as assistant editor, and then as the editor of the Courier which at the time was an influential evening journal on par with the Times. After he came to a disagreement with the owners of the Courier over policy matters, Mudform resigned from the journal and issued a letter justifying his actions. His letter drew a lot of attention at the time.  In the aftermath of his departure the Courier lost readership and eventually closed while attempts at inviting Mudford back at the journal proved unsuccessful."]}, {"page": "Edward Fitzgibbon", "response": ["The son of a land agent, Fitzgibbon was born at Limerick in 1803.

At 16 he became apprentice to a surgeon in the city, but left the profession in disgust two years later and became a classical tutor in various parts of England for three years, finding time where ever he could to practise his favourite sport. He then visited Marseilles, where he remained for six years, devoting himself to politics and the French language and literature, and becoming a welcome guest in literary and polite circles. Having taken some part in the revolution of 1830, he returned to England and recommended himself to the notice of John Black, the editor of The Morning Chronicle. Being admitted to the staff, he worked with success in the gallery of the House of Commons. For a long series of years he wrote on angling for 'Bell's Life in London,' his knowledge of the subject and the attractive style in which his articles were written giving them great celebrity. For twenty-eight years he was a diligent worker for the daily press. His 'Lucid Intervals of a Lunatic' was a paper which at the time obtained much attention. He wrote often for The Observer, and was a theatrical critic of considerable acumen."]}, {"page": "James Pratt and John Smith", "response": ["On 5 November 1835, Charles Dickens and the newspaper editor John Black visited Newgate Prison; Dickens wrote an account of this in Sketches by Boz and described seeing Pratt and Smith while they were being held there:Lauterbach and Alber (2009), p. 49.The Charles Dickens Page - A Visit to Newgate, www.charlesdickenspage.com"]}, {"page": "The Spy (periodical by James Hogg)", "response": ["No. 17 (by John Black): 'Metropolitanus' writes from London of the difficulty of producing creative writing in the face of publishers' exploitation.
