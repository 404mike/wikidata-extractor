He played as a full-back and represented England as a schoolboy. He was born in Stoke-on-Trent.\nFrank Austin began his career as a junior with Coventry City, turning professional in July 1950, although he had to wait until the 1952\u201353 season for his league debut. His career at Coventry spanned over 12 years and he played a total of 302 league games, scoring twice as Coventry rose through the divisions.\nIn January 1963 he moved to Torquay United, making his debut on 18 March in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Newport County, but only as a stand-in for George Allen. He had more success the following season, missing only one of the first 23 games before losing his place to Ray Spencer. He left Plainmoor without making any further appearances and joined non-league Chelmsford City. In the summer of 1965 Frank joined the newly formed semi-professional club Brentwood Town. Brentwood had just joined the Metropolitan League and Frank formed a successful partnership with Dai Jones in the full back position. In his second season appearances were limited due to injury. He was part of the team that won the Metropolitan League Challenge Cup in 1967.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1933 in association football", "response": ["* July 6: Frank Austin, English footballer (died 2004)"]}, {"page": "George Allen (footballer, born 1932)", "response": ["He made his Torquay debut in a 4\u20132 home win over Hull City on 20 January 1962 and was ever-present for the remainder of the season.

He began the 1963\u201364 season out of the side, Frank Austin beginning the season at left-back in his place. However, after three games, Allen regained his place and Austin switched to right-back in place of Colin Bettany.
