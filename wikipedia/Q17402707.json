After receiving the BSc (1967), MSc (1968) and PhD (1971) at Swansea he joined the faculty of the Department of Civil Engineering where served until his death in 1999.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Finite element method in structural mechanics", "response": ["The origin of finite method can be traced to the matrix analysis of structures Matrix Analysis Of Framed Structures, 3rd Edition by Jr. William Weaver, James M.

Further impetus was provided in these years by available open source finite element programs. NASA sponsored the original version of NASTRAN, and UC Berkeley made the finite element program SAP IV widely available. In Norway the ship classification society Det Norske Veritas (now DNV GL) developed Sesam in 1969 for use in analysis of ships. A rigorous mathematical basis to the finite element method was provided in 1973 with the publication by Strang and Fix. The method has since been generalized for the numerical modeling of physical systems in a wide variety of engineering disciplines, e.g., electromagnetism, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics."]}]}}
