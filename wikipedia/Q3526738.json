He played as a left-handed batsman for Hampshire and England between 1905 and 1936. He was born at 10 Ashton Buildings (since pulled down), second eldest of seven children. As a child he played for South London Schools, attending Shillingstone Street School.\nHis exceptionally straight bat and quick footwork (surprising for a man of heavy build as he was) made him one of the most difficult batsmen to dismiss throughout his career. His mastery over the best county spin bowlers even on the most treacherous pitches is remarkable, but he could also be very good against the fastest bowling because he could get closer into line than just about any batsman in cricket history.\nMead holds many batting records, notably that of scoring the most runs in the County Championship and the fourth-highest total in all first-class matches. His number of runs for Hampshire, 48,892, is the greatest number any batsman has scored for a single team. He also exceeded one thousand runs in every season of first-class cricket except his first \u2013 when he only played one match. He was also a fine fieldsman, holding 675 catches.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 26", "response": ["*1958 \u2013 Phil Mead, English cricketer and footballer (b. 1887)"]}, {"page": "1958", "response": ["* March 26 \u2013 Phil Mead, English cricketer (born 1887)"]}, {"page": "1911 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Phil Mead 2562 @ 54.51 (HS 223)", "* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Frank Foster, J W Hearne, Sep Kinneir, Phil Mead, Herbert Strudwick"]}, {"page": "1913 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Phil Mead 2627 @ 50.51 (HS 171*) "]}, {"page": "1921 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Phil Mead 3179 @ 69.10 (HS 280*)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Phil Mead"]}, {"page": "Neil McKenzie", "response": ["In January 2010, McKenzie joined English county side Hampshire as a Kolpak player for the 2010 County Championship.Neil McKenzie joins Hampshire On 5 August 2011 McKenzie hit his career best first-class score of 237 in a County Championship match against Yorkshire.

The club finished last or equal last in 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, failing to win a single game in the first of those seasons; however in 1901, with the temporary acquisition of Captain Greig from India and the qualification of Charlie Llewellyn, Hampshire won as many games as it lost. From 1906 onwards, with the qualification of Phil Mead, Jack Newman and later George Brown, Hampshire became a much more competitive side, though not until 1910 did they win as many games as they lost in a season."]}, {"page": "Broadhalfpenny Down", "response": ["alt=Fielder in front of Bat and Ball public house|thumb|Fielder in front of Bat and Ball public houseThe ground fell into disuse through most of the nineteenth century and was converted to agriculture. Attempts were made to restore the ground with the result that a Hambledon v England XI fixture in 1908 appears in the generally accepted list of first-class fixtures. This was intended as a commemorative match and featured famous players C. B. Fry and Phil Mead. Hampshire cricketer Edward Whalley-Tooker, who played in the 1908 match, was a descendant of a member of the original Hambledon Club. Following the match in 1908 the ground was reclaimed for farming. Whalley-Tooker set about the task of securing its permanent use for cricket and in 1925 it was restored to host cricket matches. The possession of the land was given to Winchester College, with the college and Hambledon playing the first match there since its restoration. Whalley-Tooker led the Hambledon side to victory."]}, {"page": "George Geary", "response": ["However, a severe arm injury ruled Geary out of the last three Tests and, though he batted with some success in many games in 1928, he could bowl so little that he took only ten expensive wickets. Yet, his powerful build was seen as so vital for the rock-hard Australian pitches that Geary, with the reputation he had acquired, was still chosen. He proved a great success, heading the averages and working amazingly hard to back up probably the strongest batting side any country has ever fielded \u2013 so strong that men of such class as Phil Mead and Ernest Tyldesley could not keep their Test places. Following on from this, 1929 was his best season ever, for he exceeded 150 wickets and on a rain-affected pitch against an admittedly weak Glamorgan batting lineup had the astonishing figures of 10 wickets for 18 runs, which was at the time the best bowling figures in the history of first-class cricket. He also had his highest ever batting aggregate with 923 runs. 1930, with the Australians back, saw Geary as powerless as all of England's other bowlers to stop the onslaught of Bradman, and he was also affected by injury. With Voce and Bowes developing he had no chance of retaining his Test place in the following years. Geary still bowled well in the wet summers of 1931 and 1932, but the dry summer of 1933 was disastrous: Geary took only 40 wickets and not once took five in an innings."]}, {"page": "Maurice Leyland", "response": ["During June 1928, Leyland was selected for another Test trial, playing for \"The Rest\" against England; then in mid-July he played for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground. At the end of July, the MCC named the team to tour Australia for the 1928\u201329 Ashes series. Leyland was included in the team; according to The Times, it would have been difficult to leave him out and his presence lifted the fielding ability of the side. His selection was controversial in the south of England, and particularly in Kent, as he took the place that the veteran Kent batsman Frank Woolley was expected to fill.Gibson, pp. 141\u201342. One Kent supporter wrote that Leyland was a \"cross bat village-greener\".Lemmon, p. 75. Pelham Warner, a selector at the time, claimed that Leyland's superior fielding influenced the decision, but the cricket writer Alan Gibson suggests that the real choice was between Woolley and Phil Mead, two batsmen of similar age.Gibson, p. 142. In 1928, the West Indies toured England, playing their first Test matches. The team did not perform well, but the England selectors picked strong teams to provide practice for the players. Leyland was selected for the last of the three Test matches.
