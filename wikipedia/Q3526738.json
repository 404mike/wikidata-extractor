He played as a left-handed batsman for Hampshire and England between 1905 and 1936. He was born at 10 Ashton Buildings (since pulled down), second eldest of seven children. As a child he played for South London Schools, attending Shillingstone Street School.\nHis exceptionally straight bat and quick footwork (surprising for a man of heavy build as he was) made him one of the most difficult batsmen to dismiss throughout his career. His mastery over the best county spin bowlers even on the most treacherous pitches is remarkable, but he could also be very good against the fastest bowling because he could get closer into line than just about any batsman in cricket history.\nMead holds many batting records, notably that of scoring the most runs in the County Championship and the fourth-highest total in all first-class matches. His number of runs for Hampshire, 48,892, is the greatest number any batsman has scored for a single team. He also exceeded one thousand runs in every season of first-class cricket except his first \u2013 when he only played one match. He was also a fine fieldsman, holding 675 catches.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
