He started in the music business as a guitarist touring with the psychedelic rock band Edgar Broughton Band. In 1986 he began performing as Sheriff Jack, releasing two albums of psychedelia music, Laugh Yourself Awake (1986) and What Lovely Melodies! (1987). As Lewis Taylor, he released his self-titled album in 1996, through Island Records, with tracks including \"Bittersweet\" and \"Lucky\" being released as singles. The album showcased a significant departure from psychedelia towards neo soul and was highly acclaimed. However, it became \"an album that everybody talked about but few bought\".Taylor released his album Stoned, Part I in 2002 on his own label named Slow Reality, and followed it up in 2004 with a sequel, Stoned, Part II. Robbie Williams covered \"Lovelight\" from Stoned, Part 1 on his 2006 album, Rudebox.\nIn June 2006, Lewis Taylor retired from music. As Andrew Taylor, he had since been musical director and bass player for Gnarls Barkley, and guitarist/backing vocalist for the Edgar Broughton Band and The Drivers. In 2016, Caroline Records re-issued his debut album on CD with a bonus disc comprising the b-sides, Lucky remixes and extended version of \"Bittersweet\". \nOn 2 June 2021 a representative for Taylor announced that work had begun on his first new studio album in 17 years. He plans to release it later in the year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pet Sounds", "response": ["In the decades since its release, Pet Sounds has influenced artists from a wide span of genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, jazz, electronic, experimental, and punk. Wilson also originated the trope of the \"reclusive genius\" among studio-oriented musical artists. Jason Guriel of The Atlantic, writing about the record in 2016, drew comparisons with the albums of Michael Jackson, Prince, and Radiohead, and said that Wilson \"certainly anticipated the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art\". In 1995, a panel of musicians, songwriters and producers, surveyed by Mojo, ranked Pet Sounds as the \"greatest record\" of all time. Referencing the album's newfound popularity in 1998, journalist Paul Lester reported that \"today's most interesting acts \u2013 The High Llamas, Air, Kid Loco, Saint Etienne, Stereolab, Lewis Taylor \u2013 are using the Brian Wilson songbook as a resource for their forays into the realms of electronic pop.\" Cornelius' 1997 release Fantasma was created as an explicit homage to Pet Sounds and contains numerous references to the album."]}, {"page": "Love Psychedelico", "response": ["They released the album This is Love Psychedelico in the United States on May 20 from HackTone RecordsThe label has released works of Mark Olson (The Jayhawks) and Lewis Taylor, etc. because David Gorman, the president of the label, wanted a contract with them after listening to a record he got from an acquaintance.
