In 1931 the club held a seven days\u2019 celebration of its coming of age, inaugurated when Terrick Williams, A.R.A. opened the annual exhibition. The Sunday Times reported that The exhibits in this year\u2019s exhibition number nearly 200, and reveal a high quality of work and a wide catholicity of taste.
