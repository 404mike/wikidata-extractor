His side were defeated 4\u20130 at Deepdale by Preston North End, and finished the game with just nine men. By now thirteen points short of safety, and seven points from their nearest competitors, The Sentinel's Chris Harper believed them to be 'the poorest side in the Third Division by quite a long chalk'. The revival started the next day, with a 2\u20130 win over Sheffield United the first of four straight home wins that cut the gap to safety down to only four points. O'Keefe and Henderson formed a potent striking partnership, whilst Young added balance to the midfield. Jim Steel was sold off to Wrexham for \u00a310,000. Rudge said the battle to avoid relegation was as difficult a job as 'trying to climb Everest in a pair of pumps'. Struggling again in February, their 4\u20132 win over Newport County lifted them off the bottom spot. Following a 4\u20133 win over Brentford on 3 March, Rudge was appointed as manager until the end of the season. He took Millwall's Andy Massey on loan, but failed to re-sign Bob Newton. On 19 March, Vale defeated fellow strugglers Southend United 2\u20131 at Roots Hall, their first away game of the league campaign, it took them out of the relegation zone. The job only got more difficult for Rudge however, as an injury crisis developed, and the team went nine games with just one victory. Young striker Mark Bright scored five times in the final six games, yet relegation was all but confirmed despite a 1\u20130 win over promotion-chasing Hull City. Just 2,299 turned up at Vale Park for a final day 1\u20130 victory over Millwall, yet a pitch invasion still ensued, with the invaders chanting \"We'll be back\".", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Andy Massey", "|14||MF||||Andy Massey||1||0||0||0||1", "| March 1984 || MF ||  || Andy Massey || Millwall || April 1984 || "]}, {"page": "Fred Onyedinma", "response": ["Onyedinma was born in Lagos, Nigeria and his parents moved the family to England, along with his brother and two sisters, when Fred was aged three.
