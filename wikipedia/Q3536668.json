Only Mushtaq and Saeed could offer any resistance. Nasim made 41 on Monday morning and almost saved the follow-on but they were all out for 219, 209 behind. In the second innings, Hanif was again dismissed quickly and Pakistan were 11 for one at close of play on Monday. As the final day got under way, another collapse looked inevitable until Mushtaq and Saeed held England at bay with a stand of 107 for the fourth wicket. With 65 minutes to go on Tuesday evening, Pakistan with five wickets left needed 22 runs more to avoid the innings defeat, Mushtaq and Shahid batting. There was then a dramatic over bowled by Trueman which could have won the game for England. First, Mushtaq was missed by substitute fielder Cyril Poole at long leg and then Shahid, who had not scored, was dropped by Titmus at slip. Pakistan batted on and Mushtaq completed a deserved century just before the close, scoring exactly 100 not out. It was his second Test century and he became the first player in Test history to achieve a second century before the age of 20. Pakistan ended on 216 for six, a lead of just seven runs, and the match was drawn."]}, {"page": "Poole (surname)", "response": ["*Cyril Poole (1921\u20131996), English cricketer and footballer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Cyril Poole"]}, {"page": "Deaths in 1996", "response": ["*Cyril Poole, English cricketer (b. 1921)"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in India, Pakistan and Ceylon in 1951\u201352", "response": ["* Cyril Poole"]}, {"page": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls at M.
