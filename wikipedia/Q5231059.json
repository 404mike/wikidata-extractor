He also shared a record opening partnership of 351 with Martyn Moxon. In contrast to the poor relations between Boycott and the senior players, many junior members of the team remember 1985 and 1986 as pleasant times to be around Boycott, who often coached them on their technique.McKinstry, p. 253. 1986 saw Boycott score 890\u00a0runs at 52.35, his season cut short by injuries which were becoming more frequent as he passed the age of 45.McKinstry, p. 255. This season was the first since 1962 that he had not hit an overall total of 1,000\u00a0runs; he finished eight short in his final match, when he was run out for 61. He advised the then captain to enforce the follow-on, and did not bat again. Since 1984, support for Boycott had waned in light of his slow scoring, multiple injuries and the general atmosphere around him. Both Brian Close and Ray Illingworth increasingly advocated his removal to Yorkshire's committee, and on 23 September 1986 it was confirmed that he would not be offered a contract for the following year. A few months later, captain David Bairstow, a long term ally of Boycott whose leadership had Boycott's support, was ruled out of the running for captaincy for the following season, which was instead given to Phil Carrick, of whom Boycott disapproved. Boycott paid tribute to the Reform Group in 1987, describing them as \"dedicated Yorkshire members with a heartfelt stake in their club.\" He suggests that Close and Illingworth feared his popularity.Boycott, p. 297. Boycott was offered contracts by other counties, including Derbyshire and Glamorgan, but he never took these offers up, nor played professional cricket again.McKinstry, pp. 257\u2013258.
