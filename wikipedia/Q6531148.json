He worked as a scientist and then a barrister.  He joined the Labour Party and won the Thurrock seat at the 1945 general election.\nIn 1948, Solley signed a petition written by John Platts-Mills in support of Pietro Nenni and the Italian Socialist Party, in defiance of Labour Party policy.  As a result, he was warned not to contravene the party line in future.\nSolley was an ardent opponent of the North Atlantic Treaty, calling instead for a united Europe and work through the United Nations.  He was one of six Labour MPs to vote against signing the Treaty, and as a result of this and his previous warning, was expelled from the party.  He then became a founder member of the Labour Independent Group, and contested Thurrock again in the 1950 general election as an \"Independent Labour\" candidate.  He failed to win, and afterwards concentrated on his career in law, while also becoming prominent in the Songwriters Guild of Great Britain.  He wrote many pieces of music in his life, including the songs for  \"The Adventures Of Twizzle\" under the pseudonym Leslie Clair, an early British television series for children.  His masterwork, an orchestral fantasy, \"Music For Orchestra\" was written in 1948 but remained undiscovered until 2008, well after his death, aged 62, in 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Leslie Solley", "*May 1949 - Leslie Solley (Thurrock) expelled from Labour Party over opposition to NATO and foreign policy; sits as Labour Independent"]}, {"page": "Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Leslie Solley"]}, {"page": "Davenant Foundation School", "response": ["* Leslie Solley, Labour MP for Thurrock from 1945\u201350 (expelled from the Labour Party in 1949 for opposing the North Atlantic Treaty)"]}, {"page": "Konni Zilliacus", "response": ["Zilliacus was frequently accused of being a communist because he was sympathetic to Soviet policies and frequently contributed articles to liberal British publications, but he was not affiliated with the Communist Party of Great Britain.
