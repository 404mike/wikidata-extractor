On arriving in London she joined indie band Junk, subsequently renamed Treehouse, well known on the Camden & Islington gig circuit (The Dublin Castle, Bull & Gate, the Laurel Tree, the Hope & Anchor, Islington).\nIn 1998 Wheeler responded to an audition for a \"girl band\" Virginia, masterminded by record producer Ian Shaw (founder of Warm Fuzz Records) and then consisting of Louise Miller and Lee Winnick, the latter shortly afterwards replaced by Laura Matthews.  Virginia featured repeatedly as guests on BBC Radio, particularly Janice Long, Jonathan Ross, Gyles Brandreth, Nicky Campbell and Ned Sherrin, as well as TV appearances in Northern Ireland on the Benny Hill Show.  Tracks from Virginia's first album Firstbite had chart success in the US Billboard charts.In 2002 her work with London gospel band Citizen K led to an introduction to Dave Hemingway of the Beautiful South.  After working on Hemingway's as yet unreleased solo album, Hemingway promised a recommendation to the Beautiful South's driving force, Paul Heaton, since a new album was in the making, despite the unexpected departure of former band member Jacqui Abbott.  By 2003, with the release of \"Gaze\", Wheeler was a member of the band, appearing live first at a Carling Homecoming at the Welly Club in Hull on 18 September 2003.  Gaze was followed by albums \"Goldiggas Headnodders and Pholk Songs\" and \"Superbi\".\nShe was dubbed Alison 'Lady' Wheeler jokingly by her bandmates in The Beautiful South who felt that her demeanour and education at Trinity College, Cambridge, was in contrast to the band's trademark working-class northern image.She remained busy during her pregnancy in 2005 touring the UK, headlining the acoustic stage at Glastonbury, in the Park and Oxygene. This was followed by nearly 50 gigs in 2006 including 2 UK tours, the V festival, an Irish tour and an American tour.\nThe band split in January 2007 due to \"musical similarities\". She spent some time enjoying motherhood and recorded a solo project.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 4", "response": ["*  1972   \u2013 Alison Wheeler, English singer-songwriter "]}, {"page": "1972 in music", "response": ["*March 4 \u2013 Alison Wheeler, British singer (The Beautiful South)"]}, {"page": "The Beautiful South", "response": ["After the band's first album (recorded as a quintet), they were joined by a succession of female vocalists.
