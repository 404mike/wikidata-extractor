She studied painting in Paris, then married Patrick Villiers-Stuart, a soldier, in 1908 and moved to India, allowing her to collect material for her 1913 book, Gardens of the Great Mughals which launched the historical study of Mughal Gardens.Chapter XII, on 'Some garden contrasts and a dream' urges respect for Indian design traditions. The 'dream' in the chapter title concerns the design of New Delhi. Her pleas for an Indian town plan had little effect but she had a conversation with Edwin Lutyens and he read her book. Both Lutyens and the viceroy, Lord Hardinge, were impressed with her ideas which was important as they were designing the new capital city for India and the Viceroy's palace. Working with Gertrude Jekyll had given him a sympathy for garden design and the result was the famous Mughal Garden of what is now Rashtrapati Bhavan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of gardening", "response": ["*Constance Villiers-Stuart"]}, {"page": "Villiers", "response": ["* Constance Villiers-Stuart (1877-1966), English author and water-colour painter"]}, {"page": "Mughal gardens", "response": ["An early textual references about Mughal gardens are found in the memoirs and biographies of the Mughal emperors, including those of Babur, Humayun and Akbar. Later references are found from \"the accounts of India\" written by various European travellers (Bernier for example). The first serious historical study of Mughal gardens was written by Constance Villiers-Stuart, with the title Gardens of the Great Mughals (1913). She was consulted by Edwin Lutyens and this may have influenced his choice of Mughal style for the Viceroy\u2019s Garden in 1912. Some examples of Mughal gardens are Shalimar Gardens (Lahore), Lalbagh Fort at Dhaka, and Shalimar Bagh (Srinagar)."]}, {"page": "Patrick Villiers-Stuart", "response": ["#REDIRECTConstance Villiers-Stuart"]}]}}
