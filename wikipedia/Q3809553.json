The motets Anna mater matris Christi (Anne, mother of the mother of Christ) and Tota Pulchra Es (My Love is Wholly Beautiful) are widely available and recorded.  A number of Plummer's compositions appear in the manuscript Brussels Bilioth\u00e8que Royale MS 5557.  During his own lifetime, knowledge and performance of his works spread at least as far as the present-day Czech Republic, where pieces such as Tota Pulchra Es were copied into the Codex Speci\u00e1ln\u00edk (c. 1500).  These pieces are unaccompanied sacred vocal music written for use in the great royal and noble chapels of northern Europe.\nPlummer was a member of the English Chapel Royal at least from 1438, and was also apparently the first to hold the office of Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1444 to 1455. He left the royal household towards the end of his career and moved to St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor, where he held the post of verger, which at the time implied greater responsibility than in more recent times. This post is likely to have supported him in his declining years.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plummer (surname)", "response": ["*John Plummer (c. 1410 \u2013 c. 1483), English composer"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Ludford", "response": ["In 1521 Ludford joined the Fraternity of St Nicholas as a 'clericus', a guild of musicians the membership of which was an essential step in the life of a London musician. This allows us to estimate that Ludford was born sometime in 1485. In 1522 he left his lodgings on King Street and took up accommodation elsewhere. This may be because he left his work at Westminster Abbey and started working at the collegiate chapel of St Stephen's, Westminster (or to give it its full title, the Royal Free Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Stephen the Protomartyr). Ludford's employment here is recorded in the accounts drawn up at the dissolution of the Chapel in 1547 which records Ludford as starting work as 'verger' on 30 September 1527. This title does not signify that Ludford was merely a caretaker of the accoutrements of worship; the term had taken on a different meaning by about 1460, when, as Roger Bowers notes, the twin foundations of St Stephen's and St George's, Windsor decided to employ a high class musician full time. The post of verger was given to the well-established John Bedyngham and John Plummer at Westminster and Windsor respectively. Meanwhile, the actual duties of the verger were transferred to the 'subsexton'. At this time Ludford was also a regular parishioner at St Margaret's, Westminster, as witness his paying  3s 4d in 1525 'for his parte of a pewe'."]}, {"page": "John Plomer", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Plummer"]}, {"page": "John Polmier", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Plummer"]}, {"page": "John Polumier", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Plummer"]}, {"page": "John Plummer (composer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Plummer"]}, {"page": "Plummer, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Plummer"]}, {"page": "1410s in music", "response": ["**John Plummer, English composer (d. c.1483)"]}]}}
