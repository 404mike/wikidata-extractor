After commanding V Corps at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915, he took command of the Second Army in May 1915 and in June 1917 won an overwhelming victory over the German Army at the Battle of Messines, which started with the simultaneous explosion of a series of mines placed by the Royal Engineers' tunnelling companies beneath German lines, which created 19 large craters and was described as the loudest explosion in human history. He later served as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine and then as Governor of Malta before becoming High Commissioner of the British Mandate for Palestine in 1925 and retiring in 1928.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1857", "response": ["* March 13 \u2013 Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer, British general (d. 1932)"]}, {"page": "1932", "response": ["* July 16 \u2013 Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer, British general (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "Eton College", "response": ["*Field Marshal Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer, WWI commander"]}, {"page": "Royal Military College, Sandhurst", "response": ["*Field Marshal Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer (1875\u20131876)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 19th century", "response": ["* Field Marshal Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer (1857\u20131932), quartermaster general, 1904\u20131905, General Officer Commanding Northern Command, 1911\u20131914, II Corps, 1914\u20131915, Second Army, 1915\u20131917, 1918, Italian Expeditionary Force, 1917\u20131918, and British Army of the Rhine, 1918\u20131919, Governor of Malta, 1919\u20131924, and High Commissioner for Palestine, 1925\u20131928"]}, {"page": "Herbert Plumer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer"]}]}}
