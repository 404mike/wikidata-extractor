He often led the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca and showed favor toward the Islamic legal scholars of Medina, notably Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab. Umar tolerated many of these scholars' open criticism of the Umayyad government's conduct. However, other accounts hold that he showed himself to be materialistic during his early career. On al-Walid's orders, Umar undertook the reconstruction and expansion of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina beginning in 707. Under Umar's generally lenient rule, the Hejaz became a refuge for Iraqi political and religious exiles fleeing the persecutions of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, al-Walid's powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate. According to Cobb, this served as Umar's \"undoing\" as al-Hajjaj pressured the caliph to dismiss Umar in May/June 712."]}, {"page": "Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.", "response": ["|Paul Cobb 24", "|Paul Cobb 21", "|Paul Cobb 18"]}, {"page": "Breaking the Rules (film)", "response": ["* Paul Cobb as distressed and snappily dressed funeral attendee"]}, {"page": "Cobb, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Cobb"]}]}}
