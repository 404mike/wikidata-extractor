The second programme in the series was an autobiographical story written by Front and her brother Jeremy. It concerns the time she witnessed the near-drowning of her father in a lake; that incident was closely followed by the death of her grandfather. The proximity of these two experiences caused Front considerable personal anguish. Front was eleven years old at the time and, because of the trauma she suffered, she went through a period of not wanting to attend school. The programme included a comedic treatment of this time in her life, followed by Front and her brother explaining the background to the story, and how they came to write and dramatise it. In the programme, Front was played by Lucy Hutchinson, and her father was played by the actor Richard Lumsden. Samantha Spiro played her mother and Front played her headmistress, Miss Dyson. Front's school friend character, Karen, was played by Imogen Front."]}, {"page": "Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay", "response": ["* In the 2017 film Darkest Hour, by Richard Lumsden."]}, {"page": "List of show business families", "response": ["** Sophie is married to actor Richard Lumsden."]}, {"page": "White Teeth", "response": ["In 2018 London's Kiln Theatre announced the world premiere of Stephen Sharkey's stage adaptation of the novel.
