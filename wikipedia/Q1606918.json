Sir Henry was described by the agency itself as \"perhaps Ordnance Survey's most eccentric and egotistical Director General\". Sir Henry spent most of his life working for the Ordnance Survey and after becoming its head he introduced the new science of photography. He also would later claim to be the inventor of the process known as Photozincography or Zinco. Sir Henry also played a part in the resolving of the battle of the scales.", "link_mentions": {}}}
