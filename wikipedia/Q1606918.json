Sir Henry was described by the agency itself as \"perhaps Ordnance Survey's most eccentric and egotistical Director General\". Sir Henry spent most of his life working for the Ordnance Survey and after becoming its head he introduced the new science of photography. He also would later claim to be the inventor of the process known as Photozincography or Zinco. Sir Henry also played a part in the resolving of the battle of the scales.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Truro", "response": ["*Major-General Sir Henry James (1803\u20131877), a Royal Engineers officer and DG of the Ordnance Survey 1854\u20131875"]}, {"page": "Henry James (disambiguation)", "response": ["Henry James (1843\u20131916) was an American author", "Henry James may also refer to:", "*Henry James (Regius Professor) (died 1717), English priest and theologian", "*Sir Henry James (British Army officer) (1803\u20131877), director-general of the Ordnance Survey", "*Henry James Sr. (1811\u20131882), American theologian, father of the author", "*Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford (1828\u20131911), English lawyer and statesman", "*Henry James (Dean of Bangor) (1864\u20131949), Dean of Bangor Cathedral, 1934\u20131940", "*Henry James (biographer) (1879\u20131947), winner of the 1931 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, nephew of the author", "*Henry James (basketball) (born 1965), American basketball player"]}, {"page": "James (surname)", "response": ["* Henry James (disambiguation), multiple people", "** Henry James (British Army officer) (1803\u20131877), director-general of the Ordnance Survey", "** Henry James, Sr. (1811\u20131882), American theologian", "** Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford (1828\u20131911), English lawyer and statesman", "** Henry James (1843\u20131916), American author and critic", "** Henry James (priest) (1864\u20131949), Dean of Bangor Cathedral, 1934\u20131940", "** Henry James (biographer) (1879\u20131947), winner of the 1931 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography", "** Henry James (basketball) (born 1965), American basketball player"]}, {"page": "Major-General Sir Henry James", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry James (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Ordnance Survey", "response": ["When Colby retired he recommended William Yolland as his successor, but he was considered too young and the less experienced Lewis Alexander Hall was appointed. After a fire in the Tower of London, the headquarters of the survey was moved to Southampton, and Yolland was put in charge, but Hall sent him off to Ireland so that when Hall left in 1854 Yolland was again passed over in favour of Major Henry James. Hall was enthusiastic about extending the survey of the north of England to a scale of 1:2,500. In 1855, the Board of Ordnance was abolished and the Ordnance Survey was placed under the War Office together with the Topographical Survey and the Depot of Military Knowledge. Eventually in 1870 it was transferred to the Office of Works.", "After the Ordnance Survey published its first large-scale maps of Ireland in the mid-1830s, the Tithe Commutation Act 1836 led to calls for a similar six-inch to the mile survey in England and Wales. Official procrastination followed, but the development of the railways added to pressure that resulted in the Ordnance Survey Act 1841. This granted a right to enter property for the purpose of the survey. Following a fire at its headquarters at the Tower of London in 1841 the Ordnance Survey relocated to a site in Southampton and was in disarray for several years, with arguments about which scales to use. Major-General Sir Henry James was by then Director General, and he saw how photography could be used to make maps of various scales cheaply and easily. He developed and exploited photozincography, not only to reduce the costs of map production but also to publish facsimiles of nationally important manuscripts. Between 1861 and 1864, a facsimile of the Domesday Book was issued, county by county; and a facsimile of the Gough Map was issued in 1870."]}, {"page": "Henry James (Ordnance Survey)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry James (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Wilson's Arch (Jerusalem)", "response": ["In the description of the survey he made at the site, Charles Wilson wrote about \"[t]he arch, which Sir Henry James has called after my name."]}, {"page": "Grade II listed buildings in Southampton: D\u2013L", "response": ["|Originally called \"Avenue House\", this substantial house on the corner of The Avenue and Rockstone Place, was one of the last buildings designed by Samuel Toomer.

To accommodate a full Royal Marine division, the barracks needed to expand: Captain Henry James R.E. oversaw the project, which included provision of a large officers' mess, along with additional officers' accommodation, to the east of the parade ground and a sergeants' mess west of the pavilions. The officers' mess included space upstairs for 80 diners plus a 30-piece orchestra, with a library and breakfast room provided downstairs along with kitchens to the rear.
