He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975; The Sunday Post compared him to a young Billy Bremner. Strachan became a regular player in the 1975\u201376 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches.
