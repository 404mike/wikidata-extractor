The setting was changed where \"The Island\" was named Boonsey, a fictional Channel Island. According to Jon Pertwee's co-written memoir, published shortly after his death in 1996, the film was also supposed to star Pertwee and Dennis Price. However, according to Pertwee the film's producer Herbert Wilcox refused to employ Price \"because he was gay.\" Pertwee was among those who objected to Price not being in the film and believed that this contributed to his own replacement in the cast by Shiner. Pertwee noted that the film \"bombed\" and said audiences did not consider the film to be The Navy Lark due to the absence of himself, Price and Stephen Murray."]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Robert Hardy,John Wood,Moira Redmond,Elvi Hale,Priscilla Morgan"]}, {"page": "The Heroes of Telemark", "response": ["* Elvi Hale as Mrs. Sandersen"]}, {"page": "Play of the Month", "response": ["|Anthony Valentine,Sarah Badel,David Robb,Judi Bowker,Daniel Day-Lewis,Elvi Hale,Susan Fleetwood"]}, {"page": "French Without Tears", "response": ["A television production was featured in the Saturday Playhouse TV series on 7 June 1958, with Denholm Elliott, Elvi Hale, Colin Broadley, Nicholas Parsons, and Andrew IrvineSaturday Playhouse; Episode 12: French Without Tears (7 June 1958), IMDb.com.
