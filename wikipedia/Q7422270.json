Composers such as Joseph Parry, whose work Myfanwy is still a favourite Welsh song, were followed by David Jenkins and D. Emlyn Evans, who tailored songs specifically for the Victorian music market.Davies (2008), pg 581. These secular hymns were embraced by the emerging male voice choirs, which formed originally as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, but also sang outside the church in a form of recreation and fellowship.Davies (2008), pg 532. The industrial workforce attracted less of a jollity of English glee clubs and also avoided the more robust militaristic style of music. Composers such as Charles Gounod were imitated by Welsh contemporaries such as Parry, Protheroe and Price to cater for a Welsh fondness of dramatic narratives, wide dynamic contrasts and thrilling climaxes. As well as the growth of male voice choirs during the industrial period, Wales also experienced an increase in the popularity of brass bands. The bands were popular among the working classes, and were adopted by paternalistic employers who saw brass bands as a constructive activity for their work forces.Davies (2008), pg 79. Solo artists of note during the nineteenth century included charismatic singers Robert Rees (Eos Morlais) and Sarah Edith Wynne, who would tour outside Wales and helped build the country's reputation as a \"land of song\".Davies (2008) p.445Davies (2008) p.734"]}, {"page": "1874 in Wales", "response": ["*The London Welsh Choral Union presents Sarah Edith Wynne with a bust of herself by Joseph Edwards."]}, {"page": "1875 in Wales", "response": ["*Sarah Edith Wynne marries and retires from her singing career."]}, {"page": "1862 in Wales", "response": ["*4 July \u2013 Sarah Edith Wynne, noted soprano, makes her London d\u00e9but."]}, {"page": "1842 in Wales", "response": ["*11 March \u2013 Sarah Edith Wynne, singer (died 1897)"]}, {"page": "Edith Wynne Matthison", "response": ["She was born on November 23, 1875, in England, the daughter of Kate Wynne Matthison and Henry Matthison.
