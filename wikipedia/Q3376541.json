Further sandalwood trees were found on Efate, Espiritu Santo, and Aneityum, prompting a series of boom and busts, though supplies were essentially exhausted by the mid-1860s, and the trade largely ceased."]}, {"page": "History of Vanuatu", "response": ["In 1825, trader Peter Dillon's discovery of sandalwood on the island of Erromango began a rush that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrant Polynesian workers and indigenous Melanesians. During the 1860s, planters in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoan Islands, in need of labourers, orchestrated a long-term indentured labour trade known as \"blackbirding\". At the height of the blackbirding, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad.

He made enquiries and found that they came from nearby Vanikoro, where two big ships had broken up years earlier. Dillon managed to obtain a ship in Bengal and sailed for the coral atoll of Vanikoro where he found cannonballs, anchors and other evidence of the remains of ships in water between coral reefs.

French explorers also reached the Solomons, with Louis Antoine de Bougainville naming Choiseul in 1768 and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Surville exploring the islands in 1769.
