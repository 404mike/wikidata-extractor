By 1898, Stewart had been replaced by Willie Wragg as Forest reached the FA Cup Final for the first time, after a controversial semi-final.", "In the final, played at Crystal Palace on 16 April 1898, Forest met Forman's old club, Derby County, who, like Forest, were making their first Cup Final appearance. Derby were favourites to win, having defeated Forest 5\u20130 in the league a few days earlier. Forest scored first after 19 minutes when Willie Wragg's free-kick fell to Arthur Capes whose shot gave Jack Fryer in the Derby goal little chance. County now began to exert pressure on the Forest defence and Forman, \"who was performing splendidly at the back\" had to clear efforts from John Goodall and Steve Bloomer. Just after the half-hour point, Derby were level after Forman gave away a free kick on the edge of the penalty area which was whipped in by Joe Leiper for Steve Bloomer to score with a header off the crossbar. Three minutes before the half-time interval, Forest were back in front after a mistake by Fryer allowed Capes a simple tap-in. Although Derby attempted to raise their game in the second half they fell further behind with four minutes left to play when John McPherson scored after John Boag failed to clear a corner, and Forest claimed the Cup with a 3\u20131 victory.1898 FA Cup final match report "]}]}}
