Jarrett started his career with Art Blakey, moving on to play with Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis. Since the early 1970s he has enjoyed a great deal of success as a group leader and a solo performer in jazz, jazz fusion, and classical music. His improvisations draw from the traditions of jazz and other genres, especially Western classical music, gospel, blues, and ethnic folk music.", "Keith Jarrett was born on May 8, 1945, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States, to a mother of Slovenian descent. Jarrett's grandmother was born in Segovci, near Apa\u010de in Slovenia, (at the time, this was in the Austria of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). Her own parents probably descended from the Slavic population of Prekmurje, a few miles away in a Hungarian part of the Empire almost totally populated by Slovenes. Jarrett's father was of mostly German descent.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 1. He grew up in suburban Allentown with significant early exposure to music. Jarrett possesses absolute pitch, and he displayed prodigious musical talents as a young child. He began piano lessons before his third birthday, and at age five he appeared on a TV talent program hosted by the swing bandleader Paul Whiteman.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett: The Man and His Music (New York: Da Capo, 1992), p. 8. He gave his first formal piano recital at the age of seven, playing works by composers such as Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and ending with two of his own compositions.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 7. Encouraged by his mother, he took classical piano lessons with a series of teachers, including Eleanor Sokoloff of the Curtis Institute.", "In his teens, as a student at Emmaus High School in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, Jarrett learned jazz and became proficient in it. He developed a strong interest in contemporary jazz; a Dave Brubeck performance was an early inspiration. He had an offer to study classical composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, an opportunity that pleased his mother but that Jarrett, already leaning toward jazz, decided to turn down.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 17.", "In New York, Art Blakey hired Jarrett to play with the Jazz Messengers. Jarrett's appearance on the Messengers' live album Buttercorn Lady marked his commercial recording debut.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 24-26. However, there was friction between Blakey and Jarrett, and after four exhausting months of touring, the latter grew tired of the situation.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 25-26. During a show he was noticed by Jack DeJohnette, who recognized the unknown pianist's talent and unstoppable flow of ideas. DeJohnette talked to Jarrett and recommended him to his band leader, Charles Lloyd.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 26. The Charles Lloyd Quartet had formed not long before and were exploring open, improvised forms while building supple grooves, and they were moving into terrain that was also being explored, although from another stylistic background, by some of the psychedelic rock bands of the west coast.Carr, Ian, Keith Jarrett, p. 32. Their 1966 album Forest Flower was one of the most successful jazz recordings of the mid-1960s, and when they were invited to play The Fillmore in San Francisco, they won over the local hippie audience.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 33. The Quartet's tours across America and Europe (including appearances in Leningrad and Moscow, and a concert at London's Royal Albert Hall attended by The BeatlesCarr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 36.), along with profiles of the band in Time and Harper's Magazine, made Jarrett a popular musician in rock and jazz. The tour also laid the foundation for a lasting musical bond with DeJohnette.", "Jarrett began to record his own tracks as a leader of small groups, at first in a trio with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian.  Life Between the Exit Signs (1967), his first album as a leader, was released by Vortex, followed by Restoration Ruin (1968), which Thom Jurek of AllMusic called \"a curiosity in his catalog\".Jurek, Thom. Allmusic \"Keith Jarrett\" biography. Retrieved 8 August 2015. Not only does Jarrett barely touch the piano, but he plays all the other instruments on what is essentially a folk-rock album. Unusually, he also sings.  Somewhere Before, another trio album with Haden and Motian, followed in 1968 for Atlantic Records.", "The Charles Lloyd Quartet with Jarrett, Ron McClure and DeJohnette came to an end in 1968, after the recording of Soundtrack, because of disputes over money as well as artistic differences.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, pp. 38\u201339. Jarrett was asked to join the Miles Davis group after the trumpeter heard him in a New York City club. (According to another version Jarrett tells, Davis had brought his entire band to see a tour date of Jarrett's own trio in Paris; the Davis band being practically the only audience, the attention made Jarrett feel embarrassed.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 45-46.) During his tenure with Davis, Jarrett played both Fender Contempo electronic organ and Fender Rhodes electric piano, alternating with Chick Corea; they can be heard side by side on some 1970 recordings:  for example, on the August 1970 Isle of Wight Festival performance preserved in the film Miles Electric: A Different Kind of Blue and on Bitches Brew Live. After Corea left in 1970, Jarrett often played electric piano and organ simultaneously.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 50. Despite his growing dislike of amplified music and electric instruments within jazz, Jarrett continued with the group out of respect for Davis and because of his desire to work with DeJohnette. Jarrett has often cited Davis as a vital influence, both musical and personal, on his own thinking about music and improvisation.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 52-54.", "DeJohnette left Davis's band in the summer of 1971, and Jarrett followed in December.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 52. Jarrett later reflected: \"When Jack left I knew I was going to have to leave... Nobody knew what Jack knew and could do what he could do simultaneously. That was the end of the flexibility of the band...\"", "In the summer of 1971, Jarrett, Haden, and Motian participated in a four-day session for Atlantic Records during which they recorded another trio album (The Mourning of a Star), along with two albums (El Juicio (The Judgement) and Birth) on which the trio was augmented by saxophonist Dewey Redman.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 56. Redman became an official member of the group, which later became known as the \"American quartet\", the following year, and, over a period of roughly five years, they would go on to record over a dozen albums. The group was often supplemented by an extra percussionist, such as Danny Johnson, Guilherme Franco, or Airto Moreira, and occasionally by guitarist Sam Brown.", "Later in 1971, the quartet, with Brown and Moreira, recorded Expectations for Columbia Records, with string and brass arrangements by Jarrett. However, Columbia suddenly dropped Jarrett in favor of Herbie Hancock,Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 57. and Jarrett's manager negotiated a contract with Impulse! Records,Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 61. for whom the group would record eight albums.", "During this time, Jarrett received a letter from producer Manfred Eicher, asking if he would like to record for the relatively young ECM label.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 58. Jarrett was impressed by the fact that Eicher was primarily concerned with musical quality, as opposed to financial gain, a sentiment that was rare in the American recording industry.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 59. Jarrett's relationship with Eicher would prove to be one of the most significant factors in his career, and has continued to the present day. Jarrett's American quartet would go on to release two albums (The Survivors' Suite and Eyes of the Heart) on ECM, and the label also issued Ruta and Daitya, consisting of duo tracks featuring Jarrett and DeJohnette recorded in early 1971 while the two were with Miles Davis, after Jarrett gave tapes of the session to Eicher.", "In 1972, Eicher proposed that Jarrett work with Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek, whom Jarrett had met while in Europe with Charles Lloyd during the late 1960s. Their initial collaborations laid the groundwork for what would become known as the \"European quartet\", which also featured Palle Danielsson on bass and Jon Christensen on drums, and which existed concurrently with the American quartet.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett, p. 74. The group, which would record five albums for ECM, played in a style similar to that of the American quartet, but with many of the avant-garde and Americana elements replaced by the European folk and classical music influences that characterized the work of ECM artists at the time.", "The studio albums are modestly successful entries in the Jarrett catalog, but in 1973, Jarrett also began playing totally improvised solo concerts, and it is the popularity of these voluminous concert recordings that made him one of the best-selling jazz artists in history. Albums released from these concerts were Solo Concerts: Bremen/Lausanne (1973), to which Time magazine gave its 'Jazz Album of the Year' award; The K\u00f6ln Concert (1975), which became the best-selling piano recording in history;Keith Jarrett Biography , All About Jazz. Retrieved April 6, 2010. and Sun Bear Concerts (1976) \u2013 a 10-LP (and later 6-CD) box set.", "After a hiatus, Jarrett returned to the extended solo improvised concert format with Paris Concert (1990), Vienna Concert (1991), and La Scala (1995). These later concerts tend to be more influenced by classical music than the earlier ones, reflecting his interest in composers such as Bach and Shostakovich, and are mostly less indebted to popular genres such as blues and gospel. In the liner notes to Vienna Concert, Jarrett named the performance his greatest achievement and the fulfillment of everything he was aiming to accomplish: \"I have courted the fire for a very long time, and many sparks have flown in the past, but the music on this recording speaks, finally, the language of the flame itself.\"Keith Jarrett, liner notes, Vienna Concert, ECM Records, 1992.", "The Standard Trio disbanded in 2014 after more than 30 years. The final concert of Keith Jarrett's trio was on November 30, 2014 at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, New Jersey.
