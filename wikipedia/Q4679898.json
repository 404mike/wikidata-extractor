Tinworth (born 6 November 1971) is a journalist and writer who co-authored two major role-playing games, Demon: The Fallen and Werewolf: The Forsaken from White Wolf Publishing. He was also an extensive contributor to Hunter: The Reckoning, a game line that was subsequently ported to video games.\nSince around 2005, he has become known as a commenter and analyst of digital journalism and social media. The Guardian covered his dispute with the National Union of Journalists over the role of bloggers in the news ecosystem, and has extensively referenced his work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mage: The Ascension", "response": ["Adam Tinworth of Arcane gave Mage: The Ascension second edition a score of 8/10, calling it good for those who like involving and challenging games; he noted that it could be difficult for new players to grasp the entire background and how magic works, and to develop their own style of magic, but found the gameplay system itself to be easy to understand for newcomers."]}, {"page": "Wraith: The Oblivion", "response": ["Adam Tinworth of Arcane gave Wraith: The Oblivion second edition a score of 9/10, calling it \"one of the most mature and involving\" role-playing games ever. He appreciated how the gameplay systems work to create a dark atmosphere, how the single-dice-roll action mechanic allowed for degrees of success or failure while remaining simple to use, and how the concept of a player character having a Shadow controlled by another player allowed for players to remain active even when their own character was not the focus of a scene; he did however criticize the combat system rules as confusing, something he called a recurring problem with games using the Storyteller System. He also noted that the game's \"horrific\" background, and the Shadow system's potential for player abuse, meant that both players and the storyteller would need to put in effort to keep the game from being too depressive and hopeless."]}, {"page": "List of role-playing game designers", "response": ["*Adam Tinworth - Demon: The Fallen, Werewolf: The Forsaken; contributions to Hunter: The Reckoning"]}, {"page": "Dark Ages: Inquisitor", "response": ["In 1991, White Wolf created the horror role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade set in the modern-day World of Darkness universe.
