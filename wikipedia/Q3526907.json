His run-up was made up of six rapid, economical steps, but, according to the man himself, \"I really used to bowl faster than people thought I did, and I could make the ball break both ways, but not much. In my opinion, length and variation of pace constitute the secret of successful bowling.\" However, although he was regarded almost universally as \"the high priest of length\", he and Ted Peate together poured scorn all over suggestions that they were capable of \"hitting the spot\" with nearly every delivery (as was the common perception)."]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["In a tribute to Hawke, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack related that Hawke's \"strength of the character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\". Derek Birley commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".Birley, pp. 134\u2013135. The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\".", "Hawke enjoyed a personal success in the second match of the 1883 season when he scored his maiden first-class century with 141 for Cambridge against C I Thornton's XI at Fenner's. He shared a third wicket partnership of 160 with Cambridge captain Charles Studd against a bowling attack that included Test players Billy Barnes, Ted Peate and George Ulyett. The match was drawn due to interruptions by rain after Thornton's XI scored 175 and 229; Cambridge replied with 317 and 44\u20133.", "Although some people assumed that Hawke had turned his back on Yorkshire, he returned with new vigour in 1886 to begin what he himself referred to as his consistent association with the county. While Hawke had formerly been the figurehead who tossed the coin, he now took complete charge of operations and began the transformation of the team in earnest.Coldham, p. 47. The team that Hawke inherited from Emmett, which Hawke referred to as \"the boys of my old brigade\", was in decline by 1886 and several players would retire or be dismissed during the next couple of years so that, by the end of the 1887 season, it was clear that Yorkshire faced what Coldham called \"a protracted period of rebuilding\".Coldham, p. 59. Within the next seasons, the likes of Ted Peate, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Louis Hall and George Ulyett had all retired. Left arm spinner Bobby Peel, wicket-keeper David Hunter, all-rounder George Hirst, opening batsman Jack Brown and the amateurs Stanley Jackson and Ernest Smith were among the replacements who formed Yorkshire's successful teams of the 1890s and 1900s.Hodgson, p. 53."]}, {"page": "Charles Turner (Australian cricketer)", "response": ["* taking 283 wickets in the English season of 1888 for 11.27 runs each.

Once discovered, however, Emmett climbed almost immediately to the top of the cricketing tree, playing for England against Surrey & Sussex in Tom Lockyer's benefit match at the Oval in 1867, his second season. An even greater bowler, George Freeman, was approaching his best at the same time, and, from 1867 to the end of 1871, they dominated the English bowling scene. After 1871, however, business commitments took Freeman away from first-class cricket, but Emmett stayed on and found another able colleague in the excellent Allen Hill. In later years, Emmett shared the Yorkshire bowling duties with George Ulyett, Billy Bates, Ted Peate and Bobby Peel. He called his most famous delivery the \"sostenuter\": after pitching on leg the ball would break back a long way to take the off-stump. As time went on, Emmett's pace deserted him."]}, {"page": "Edmund Peate", "response": ["#redirectTed Peate"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Ted Peate \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Holbeck", "response": ["* Ted Peate (1855\u20131900), cricketer."]}, {"page": "Bradford Premier League", "response": ["* Ted Peate (England)"]}, {"page": "1888 English cricket season", "response": ["* 23 August \u2013 Charles Turner takes his 215th wicket, beating Ted Peate's 1882 record for most wickets in a season.

The decision proved a poor one though, as Australia were easily skittled out for a meagre 63 in 80 overs, taking just over 2 hours. The captain himself tried to offer resistance with a slow defensive 13, and experienced wicket-keeper/batsman Jack Blackham top-scored with 17, but the only other batsman to reach double-figures was Tom Garrett with 10. Inspired bowling from opening bowler Ted Peate who took 4 for 31, and Dick Barlow who produced a devastating 5 for 19, ripped the Australian batting order apart on a greenish wicket that gave more assistance that it first seemed.", "The tension was unbearable; contemporary accounts famously report that one spectator dropped dead and another gnawed through the handle of his umbrella. The very next over from the other end, Harry Boyle removed Barnes for 2 and then, with the last ball of his over, clean bowled Ted Peate for 2 to have England all out for 77 off exactly 55 overs."]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1884", "response": ["This was the inaugural Lord's Test and England won by an innings after a century by A. G. Steel and fine bowling by Ted Peate and George Ulyett. The game ended just after lunch on the third day.", "The next ten matches prior to the Old Trafford Test were played mainly in the north of England and the Australians did very well in this period, through June and into early July. They lost only to the North by an innings at Old Trafford when their batting struggled against Ted Peate and Ulyett while good scores by A. N. Hornby and Barnes ensured the North's victory. Giffen had a memorable game when the Australians played Lancashire at Old Trafford, taking a hat-trick in the Lancashire innings and then scoring 113. That match was drawn but the Australians defeated both Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire by the same three-wicket margin. Spofforth, Palmer, Peate and Tom Emmett dominated the match at Bradford in which only 255 runs were scored in total. At Trent Bridge, the bowling of Giffen and Palmer enabled the Australians to recover from a first innings deficit of 39 and win. In the return match against the Gentlemen at the Oval, the last three English batsmen including Lord Harris were all stumped by Jack Blackham.Robinson, p.43.", "Putting the Australian performances into perspective, only eight Englishmen made 1,000 runs and only Harris scored more than Murdoch. Louis Hall with four completed the most centuries while Harris, Grace, Ulyett and Billy Bates made three apiece. Spofforth was easily the highest wicket-taker, beating the best English bowler Ted Peate by 70 while Palmer was third overall. Seven other Englishmen managed 100 wickets in the season."]}, {"page": "History of the England cricket team to 1939", "response": ["The developing rivalry took on a new turn in 1882, when England lost at home at The Oval in the solitary Test of the summer.  Spofforth took 7 for 46 and 7 for 44 and Ted Peate, Yorkshire slow left armer who had taken 8 wickets, was out just 8 runs short of victory. Upset at this turn of events, The Sporting Times printed an obituary to English cricket: \"In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P.

Carter served on the Yorkshire committee for many years."]}, {"page": "George Harrison (Yorkshire cricketer)", "response": ["Harrison consequently came straight into a strong Yorkshire eleven when he dismissed Monkey Hornby in the first innings, and bowled out Lord Harris for 2 in the second. Harrison soon became regarded as the fastest bowler seen for some time in first-class cricket, and in only his third first-class match against Kent he took eleven for 76 and bowled unchanged through both innings with Ted Peate.
