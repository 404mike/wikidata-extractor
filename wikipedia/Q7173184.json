Later, he became famous during the Korean War for shooting down a jet-engined MiG-15 while flying a piston-engined Hawker Sea Fury, the only recorded victory of a piston-engined aircraft over a jet fighter during the Korean War. However, this claim is now disputed, and the kill is currently claimed by another Royal Navy pilot \u2013 Brian 'Schmoo' Ellis \u2013 flying with Carmichael on the day in-question.", "link_mentions": {}}}
