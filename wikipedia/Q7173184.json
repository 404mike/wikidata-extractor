One topic that Reardon discussed is that Lee concluded to attack reasonably. He evaluates all his options compared them to his ultimate objective. Reardon explains that the first thing that Lee witnessed of day one of Gettysburg is the final attack of the day. It was an attack on open ground and it was a smaller scale of what was later be used at Pickett's Charge. Additionally, on the second day a small amount the Confederate forces were able to get close to the Union line. Ultimately, Reardon argued that Lee asked himself the question 'What can I do?' and then devised a logical plan for the third day. One issue Reardon explains is that it is not concretely known what was Lee's intention at Gettysburg because there are not a lot of primary sources. For example, there were no notes taken at the meeting between Jefferson Davis and Lee; thus, it is not known was discussed there. At the time of the Civil War, it was not required that there be a commander's intent. Reardon does discuss that the purpose of artillery bombardment was to destroy the Union's artillery to hit an area target of both Clump of Trees and Ziegler's Grove. Reardon also discussed how historians believe that Lee was aiming for the seam between two different Union groups. At the end of the talk, Reardon explains how the Union army did a great job at Gettysburg."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 1997", "response": ["*Peter Carmichael, 73, British fighter pilot during World War II and the Korean War."]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Worksop College", "response": ["*Peter Carmichael - fighter pilot."]}, {"page": "Carmichael, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Carmichael"]}]}}
