Morison was consulted to advise on a custom typeface for the Times around the end of Perpetua's convoluted development. One of several options proposed was a modified version of Perpetua, increased in bulk for the conditions of newspaper printing. (Robin Kinross has noted that Perpetua's basic design is \"hardly robust enough for newspaper printing.\") In the end Monotype created a new font, Times New Roman, for that project instead, basing it on an earlier typeface named Plantin, but one of the key modifications was sharpening Times's serifs, similar to Perpetua's design; Morison's cited reason for the change was to resemble the previous fonts used. Times New Roman when released to general use rapidly became one of the most popular fonts in the history of printing. In Monotype's sales chart through to 1984 Times ranks top of all, with Perpetua eighteenth out of forty-three. The Times did use Perpetua Titling for some sections in the metal type period."]}, {"page": "Eye (magazine)", "response": ["Frequent contributors include Phil Baines, Steven Heller, John-Patrick Hartnett, Richard Hollis, Paul Kahn, Robin Kinross, Jan Middendorp, J.
