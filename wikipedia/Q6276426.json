The New Year started disappointingly as the Blades crashed to their first defeat since the beginning of November as they were beaten 3\u20132 at Carlisle United. Following Danny Wilson being awarded 'League One Manager of the Month' for December, United soon got back to winning ways when they returned to home soil.  The team saw off Salisbury City 3\u20131 in the third round of the FA Cup, the first meeting ever between the two clubs, and then outclassed Yeovil Town a few days later, hitting four without reply including a brace from Lee Williamson and a first ever club goal from captain Michael Doyle. With Danny Wilson looking to freshen up his squad United rewarded four of its younger players with contract extensions, with Erik T\u00f8nne and David McAllister set to remain with the club until the summer of 2014, and youth team players Jordan Chapell and Jack Adams agreeing new deals until the end of the season. In a busy day the club saw the departure of Elian Parrino as his short term deal came to an end, and then allowed McAllister to join League Two club Shrewsbury Town on a months loan, with manager Danny Wilson bemoaning a lack of reserve games under the current system.  The following week Wilson continued to overhaul the squad with reserve keeper Mihkel Aksalu leaving the club on mutual terms, but was boosted by 'fans favourite' James Beattie agreeing a deal to remain at Bramall Lane until the end of the season. Meanwhile, back in the league the Blades then continued their fine run of form, completing their second league double of the week, as they hit three without reply away at Bury, but that form deserted them for a top-of-the-table trip to Charlton Athletic where a bad tempered match resulted in both teams being reduced to ten men and a 1\u20130 loss for United.  Seven days later United suffered their first back-to-back defeats of the season as they crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of Birmingham City. With the transfer window about to close Bramall Lane was relatively quite on deadline day; Danny Philliskirk was handed an extended deal, and striker Will Hoskins signed on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion until the end of the season, whilst youngster Erik T\u00f8nne was allowed to join Yorkshire neighbours York City, also until the end of the season. The club also gave a trial to experienced Scottish defender David Weir with a view to a potential short term contract."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["Pre-season began with 11 players being released, including former Player of the Year James Beattie, defenders Andy Taylor and Johnny Ertl, and first choice stopper Steve Simonsen. Three senior out-of-contract players were offered new terms with Kevin McDonald, Chris Porter and Lee Williamson being offered the chance to remain with United. On 5 July Chris Porter signed a two-year contract with the option of a third, while Academy graduate Jordan Chapell also agreed a new one-year deal. The following day young right-back Matthew Lowton was sold to Premier League Aston Villa for an undisclosed fee. The Blades returned to pre-season training having arranged the now annual pre-season tour of Malta, followed by a string of low key friendlies. With manager Danny Wilson seeking to improve the squad, on 13 July he signed 19-year-old striker John Cofie from Manchester United on a season-long loan. The first game of pre-season came against non-league Ilkeston where a side relying mainly on young players and triallists were held to a 1\u20131 draw after Harry Maguire had opened the scoring. A day later the Blades made their first permanent signing of the transfer window with 21-year-old right back Darryl Westlake signing a two-year deal with the option of a third year, with a fee to be agreed with his former club Walsall via a tribunal due to his age.", "November began with a trip to Bristol to face Bristol Rovers in the first round of the FA Cup. Despite conceding an early goal United came back to score twice in the second half and book their place in the second round. Back in League One an away trip to Swindon Town ended in a 0\u20130 stalemate, but it was a result that allowed United to climb into the automatic promotion places for the first time in the season. A few days later vice-captain Neill Collins extended his current contract by a further two years until Summer 2015 with the option of another year, before the Blades unbeaten run finally came to an end as they conceded a controversial last minute penalty to lose 1\u20130 away at Milton Keynes Dons. The following week Matthew Harriott was allowed to join Alfreton Town on loan, initially until 9 December, while Harry Maguire made his England Under-21 d\u00e9but as a substitute in the 60th minute, coming on for Liverpool's Andre Wisdom in a 2\u20130 against Northern Ireland Under-21 at Bloomfield Road. A few days later it was announced that Danny Wilson had been named League One Manager of the Month and that George Long had won League One Player of the Month for October. Later the same day, Dave Kitson extended his contract until the end of the season with the option of another year; Kitson stated that \"It wouldn't have sat comfortably with me to leave a job half done after integrating myself into a great squad\". At the end of a busy week free agent and former Wales national goalkeeper Danny Coyne signed a 28-day deal as cover for George Long as third choice keeper George Willis had sustained a minor injury preventing him from playing. Seven days after the disappointing defeat at MK Dons, United returned to winning ways in emphatic style, convincingly beating promotion rivals Stevenage 4\u20131 at Bramall Lane, thanks in part to a brace from Shaun Miller who was making his first league start for United. A mid-week home fixture against Crewe Alexandra followed which ended in a 3\u20133 draw, despite United having taken a two-goal lead in the first half. The following day Jordan Chapell extended his loan with Burton Albion for a further month, before the final game of November saw United slip to a damaging 2\u20130 defeat away at Brentford.", "On 1 December the Blades returned to winning ways with a late 2\u20131 victory over former United boss Micky Adams's Port Vale side in the second round of the FA Cup at Bramall Lane. Shaun Miller saved the day for the Blades with a brace in injury time after Vale had taken the lead in the first half. With the Blades beginning to struggle with injuries Jordan Chapell was recalled early from his loan spell at Burton Albion, and returned to the United first-team later that day as the Blades crashed out of the Football League Trophy on penalties to Coventry City. Meanwhile, Matthew Harriott extended his loan deal with Alfreton Town until 6 January and back in the league United returned to winning ways, defeating Carlisle United 3\u20131, but were held to a 0\u20130 draw by table-topping Tranmere Rovers the following week. After Danny Coyne extended his short-term contract to keep him with the club until the end of January, United started their festive programme by rising to the top of the League One table following a 2\u20130 win over Crawley Town on their first ever visit to the Broadfield Stadium thanks to two goals from Tony McMahon, before a comfortable 3\u20130 home win over Scunthorpe United on Boxing Day consolidated their place as league leaders. With injuries and suspensions starting to weaken the first-team United finished the year by slipping to a surprising 2\u20133 home defeat to bottom club Hartlepool United, a result which saw them drop to second in the table. On 28 December it was announced that due to injuries sustained against Scunthorpe United, Shaun Miller would be out for the remainder of the season and out up to nine months in total with a cruciate knee ligament injury; whilst Neill Collins would be out for around two months with a fractured cheekbone.", "March started with a 2\u20130 victory over Oldham Athletic, before the Blades managed to hold onto second place in the league, despite being held to a second consecutive 0\u20130 home draw, this time against Milton Keynes Dons. After United's scheduled trip to Crewe Alexandra was postponed due to a frozen pitch, Jordan Chapell was loaned out to Torquay United until the end of the season. The following day Chris Porter returned from his loan spell at Shrewsbury Town to increase United's striking options, before United's away run was brought to a halt as Stevenage beat them 4\u20130 at The Lamex Stadium. United signed young striker Joe Ironside to a two and a half-year deal, before allowing Richard Cresswell to re-join his first ever club, York City, on a one-month loan deal. Later the same day former United player Jamie Hoyland resigned his post as Academy manager. Due to a lack of first team opportunities Erik T\u00f8nne was allowed to return to his native Norway for a trial with HamKam ahead of a potential loan move. A busy week off the field concluded with young keeper George Long being named Young Player of the Month for February 2013 by The Football League. United's fixture problems continued when their scheduled home game with Brentford was called off due to heavy snowfall, meaning that their first game for two weeks came against promotion rivals Tranmere Rovers, with an own goal from Tranmere's Ash Taylor being enough to secure the points for United.", "April started with yet another goalless draw at Bramall Lane when Carlisle United held their hosts, despite being reduced to ten men for the final third of the game. Two days later on-loan forward Dominic Poleon was recalled by his parent club, Leeds United, while Erik T\u00f8nne was allowed to join Norwegian side HamKam on loan until November 2013. An away trip to Walsall provided yet another draw for United, with a second half goal from Chris Porter rescuing a point for the Blades. United continued their disappointing home form into the following game when Crawley Town were 2\u20130 victors, a result that saw Danny Wilson sacked the following day, and being replaced by reserve team coach Chris Morgan for the remainder of the season. The following day the club announced former player and Academy coach, David Unsworth as assistant to Morgan for the duration of his tenure. The new management team's first action was to recall Jordan Chapell from his loan spell at Torquay United. Chris Morgan's first game in charge saw Swindon Town visit Bramall Lane, with United running out as 2\u20130 winners, thanks to goals from Porter and Kitson. Following an injury to one of his Achilles tendons, Richard Cresswell returned early from his loan at York City, the day before a dramatic game home against Brentford saw three players sent off and four penalties awarded as the teams played out a 2\u20132 draw. On the penultimate weekend of the season United, saw their hopes of automatic promotion extinguished as they were beaten 3\u20130 by already relegated Portsmouth, although results elsewhere confirmed their place in the play-offs. Their poor form continued with a 1\u22120 away loss Crewe Alexandra, followed by yet another 0\u20130 home draw against Preston North End in the final game of the regular season. Meanwhile, Academy prospects Conor Dimaio and Jamie McDonagh were called up to the Ireland under\u201318s and the Northern Ireland under\u201319s respectively, while young defender Harry Maguire was named as the club's Player of the Year and was named in the PFA League One Team of the Year, winning both for the second season in succession.", "| Jordan Chapell", "| Jordan Chapell"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["|Jordan Chapell"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["* 23 October: Albion sign winger Jordan Chapell on an emergency one-month loan deal from Sheffield United.

Later that week youth Team coach and former assistant manager, David Unsworth, was given permission by United to speak with Kilmarnock about their vacant managerial position, but rejected the approach. With Barry Robson having already left the club, United subsequently announced their retained list, and signalled the departure of Danny Coyne, Matthew Harriott, Lecsinel Jean-Fran\u00e7ois and Dave Kitson.

Despite the club having only recently extended his contract, Jordan Chapell was joined Torquay United on a free transfer on 9 July, agreeing a 2-year deal with the south coast club.
