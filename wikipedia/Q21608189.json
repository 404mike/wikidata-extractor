He was born in Aston and died in Erdington, both in Birmingham.\nWarwickshire's bowling in 1923 was heavily dependent on the fast bowler, Harry Howell, who took nearly three times the number of wickets of any other player, and whose main support came from the amateur players Freddie Calthorpe and Norman Partridge. Wassell was one of several professionals introduced to the team in an attempt to bolster the bowling; he was a lower-order batsman whose batting hand is unknown and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. Though given seven games, he was not a success. He reached double figures as a batsman only once and his best bowling in an innings was three wickets for 67 runs in the match against Gloucestershire. He did not play any further first-class cricket after the 1923 season.\nCricketArchive records that his birth was registered as \"Albert Wassall\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
