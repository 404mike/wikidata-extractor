They bought the Swedish striker Patrik Redo, whom they later had to sell to Keflav\u00edk Football Club. In 2008 Fram played their best season in many years when they finished 3rd in the Landsbankadeild. In 2009 the club was number 4, and played in the Icelandic Cup Final but lost to Brei\u00f0ablik UBK in a penalty shootout. Now it seems as if Fram Reykjav\u00edk is back among the best again. Fram's woes continued in the spring of 2006. In 2008 things changed a lot though a new manager came that had been playing for Fram Reykjav\u00edk in the famous 86\u201391 team \u00deorvaldur \u00d6rlygsson. He started by buying Au\u00f0un Helgason, a former Icelandic international football player Assistant manager. For the third time in three years, a new coach would take the helm and most of the time it seemed as if nobody could lead Fram Reykjav\u00edk out of the dark. This time, however, it was a complete success. Fram Reykjav\u00edk won four straight games, gobbling up KR's lead as team number 3 in the table (a qualifying position for the UEFA Cup), and finally overtaking them. Fram Reykjav\u00edk against FH Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur where they won away which was for the first time in many years, the team that was supposed to be unbeatable they managed to win. The following weekend, Fram Reykjav\u00edk beat Keflav\u00edk, securing the club's third position in the league for the first time since 1992. Fram Reykjav\u00edk was back in European competition: the team that almost drew at Nou Camp 18 years ago was back, and there was more good news to come, \u00deorvaldur \u00d6rlygsson accepted a new offer to be the manager. The summer of 2009 came out to be not as good as expected in \u00darvalsdeild Fram Reykjav\u00edk finished 4th, which was an obvious disappointment. And in Visa-Bikar 2009 Fram Reykjav\u00edk made it to the finals but lost in penalty kickout against Brei\u00f0ablik UBK where Paul McShane missed the last penally for Fram Reykjav\u00edk, in UEFA Cup 2009 Fram won The New Saints F.C. easily in the first round but in the second round Fram Reykjav\u00edk traveled to Czech Republic to play Sigma Olomouc the first match went 1\u20131 where Sigma scored a goal almost in the last second of the match. The second match Sigma Olomouc won but Fram Reykjav\u00edk was told to have played maybe their best matches of the summer there and they showed that on a good day they could play like the big teams in Europe. Before the 2009 season \u00deorvaldur \u00d6rlygsson brought several new players to Fram Reykjav\u00edk, one of them being J\u00f3n Gunnar Eysteinsson who \u00deorvaldur \u00d6rlygsson knew well from Fjar\u00f0abygg\u00f0, he was supposed to come instead of Au\u00f0un Helgason that went to Grindav\u00edk and Some other players like the English brothers which both started their career playing for Chelsea F.C., Joe Tillen and Sam Tillen the team of 2010 was one of the youngest teams ever in Icelandic football, the oldest player was 25 years old.
