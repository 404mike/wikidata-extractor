However, four wickets from Jamaican-born Gareth Breese helped stem the tide. In reply, Nathan Astle and Gordon Muchall both made 64 \u2013 the latter a not out \u2013 and Ealham was smashed about, conceding 51 runs in four overs. It was almost as bad for Andrew Harris, who conceded 38 off 15 legitimate deliveries as Durham won with three balls to spare.", "Yorkshire Phoenix got their first win in three Twenty20 games, but the quarter-finals still looked out of sight, as they needed to win their last game and Derbyshire lose their last. Batting first, Ian Harvey, Craig White and Paul Jaques all made scores between 40 and 60, to lift Yorkshire to 126 for 1 at one point. Off-spinner Gary Scott and medium-pacer Dale Benkenstein took three wickets between them, but Yorkshire still managed 171 for 7. Durham Dynamos looked in the game when Benkenstein and Gordon Muchall were at the crease, pairing up for 79 for the fourth wicket, but a burst of wickets \u2013 thanks to Richard Dawson and Anthony McGrath's bowling \u2013 sent Durham to the ropes at 111 for 8. Twelve minutes later, it was all over for 131, with 17 deliveries remaining. Yorkshire's 30-year-old seam bowler Adam Warren took two for 32 on Twenty20 debut."]}, {"page": "NBC Denis Compton Award", "response": ["*Durham \u2013 Gordon Muchall"]}, {"page": "2006 English cricket season", "response": ["On 18 April, the County Championship began, but the first matches were dominated by rain; at Old Trafford, Lancashire and Hampshire played out 169.3 overs,Lancashire v Hampshire in 2006, scorecard from CricketArchive, retrieved 16 June 2006 compared to the minimum of 408 set out in ECB regulations,Regulations and Playing Conditions in the County Championship , retrieved 16 June 2006 in a drawn game, while Gloucestershire overcame Somerset in Division Two despite 36 and 172 from Australian overseas player Cameron White.Gloucestershire v Somerset in 2006, scorecard from CricketArchive, retrieved 16 June 2006 Excluding extras, the other ten players contributed with 197 runs, eleven less than White.
