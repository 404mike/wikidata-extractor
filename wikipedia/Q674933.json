One group, consisting of Cardinals Joseph Ritter of St. Louis, Albert Gregory Meyer of Chicago, Franz K\u00f6nig of Vienna and Achille Li\u00e9nart of Lille (supported by Bishops Elchinger and M\u00e9ndez Arceo) took to the podium and spoke clearly against the \"watered down\" Paul VI-Cicognani revision and supported a full return to the previous draft authored by Cardinal Bea and the SECU, with the repudiation of the deicide theme against Jews of any generation clearly included. The other group, consisting of Cardinals Richard Cushing of Boston, Giacomo Lercaro of Bologna and Paul-\u00c9mile L\u00e9ger of Montreal (supported by Bishops Nierman, Daem, Jaeger, Pocock and O'Boyle) proposed instead that the new draft should be accepted, to get its foot in the door, but amended to cover the deicide issue and an explicitly condemnation of what they called \"persecutions and injustices\" against Jews throughout the ages, to the present day. Two Americans, Bishop Leven and Archbishop O'Boyle, took the most radical position on the topic and proposed the document should repudiate any hope of Jewish conversion to Christianity, flirting with themes of universal salvation and dual-covenant theology respectively. Cardinal John Heenan, the English Archbishop of Westminster, also spoke in favour of the liberal faction on the issue at a press conference the following day. On the deicide question, he admitted that \u201cJesus Christ was condemned to death by the Sanhedrin,\u201d but \"the Jewish people as such cannot be held guilty for the death of Christ.\" He affirmed to \"do all [he] could to satisfy the desires of [his] Jewish friends.\" The document was sent back to the SECU for amendments on 29 September 1964 with over 70 suggestions."]}, {"page": "Archbishop of Westminster", "response": ["| John Heenan"]}, {"page": "John Carmel Cardinal Heenan", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Heenan (cardinal)"]}, {"page": "John Heenan", "response": ["John Heenan may refer to:", "*John Heenan (cardinal) (1905\u20131975), Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster"]}, {"page": "John C.

John Heenan's brother James had also helped to look after the fighter. On the morning of the fight, MacDonald was surprised to find out that Sayers would be his assistant in the corner, having been told that James Heenan would be fulfilling that role.  In theory this switch should have been a sound decision, as Sayers had displayed crafty ring-tactics as a fighter. However, by this time, he was in the later stages of untreated diabetes and was of no help whatsoever to Heenan as the fight slipped away from him. Sayers had bet heavily on Heenan, losing hundreds of pounds on the fighter's loss. In January 1864, legal proceedings were initiated against the fighters, seconds and other prominent participants in the  prizefight. The proceedings concluded in April with the chief participants having to lodge \u00a3100 surety with the court in case of further court action."]}, {"page": "Cardinal J. C.
