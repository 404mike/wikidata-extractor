Robert Adams Paterson (c. 1829 \u2013 April 1904) was a Scottish-American clergyman who invented the inventor of the gutta-percha golf ball \u2014 known as the guttie \u2014 in 1848.Paterson was born in Scotland, where he attended the University of St Andrews. Golf was popular at the university, but Paterson was very poor and could not afford to buy the expensive balls, which were made with pigskin and stuffed with feathers. He instead used gutta-percha, which had been wrapped around an idol from India as packaging.He died in Bloomfield, New York. He was a president of the New York State Ladies' College of Binghamton.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Golf ball", "response": ["In 1848, the Rev. Dr. Robert Adams Paterson (sometimes spelled Patterson) invented the gutta-percha ball (or guttie, gutty). The guttie was made from dried sap of the Malaysian sapodilla tree.  The sap had a rubber-like feel and could be made spherical by heating and shaping it in a mold. Because gutties were cheaper to produce, could be re-formed if they became out-of-round or damaged, and had improved aerodynamic qualities, they soon became the preferred ball for use. Accidentally, it was discovered that nicks in the guttie from normal use actually provided a ball with a more consistent ball flight than a guttie with a perfectly smooth surface.  Thus, makers began intentionally making indentations into the surface of new balls using either a knife or hammer and chisel, giving the guttie a textured surface.  Many patterns were tried and used. These new gutties, with protruding nubs left by carving patterned paths across the ball's surface, became known as \"brambles\" due to their resemblance to bramble fruit."]}, {"page": "Robert Paterson", "response": ["* Robert Adams Paterson (1829\u20131904), Scottish golf ball inventor"]}]}}
