He attended Mayfield College near Mayfield, Sussex. During the Second World War he served in East Africa as a major and was adjutant to the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion of the King's African Rifles.\nGwynn is perhaps best remembered for his role in the first episode of the BBC comedy Fawlty Towers \"A Touch of Class\" (1975) as the conman \"Lord\" Melbury who eventually humiliates Basil Fawlty. For Hammer Films, he performed in several productions including the war film The Camp on Blood Island (1958), and Never Take Sweets from a Stranger (1960), a rare drama film for the studio; the actor also appeared in one of their very best horror movies, The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), in which he played a tragic experimental subject who turns into a cannibalistic killer, and the less well-regarded Scars of Dracula (1970) in the role of a priest determined to battle Count Dracula. He had a lead role in 1960's Village of the Damned, produced and distributed by MGM-British Studios.Gwynn also appeared on several adaptations of plays on the Caedmon Records label. Among them were Cyrano de Bergerac, in which he played Le Bret, and Julius Caesar, in which he played Casca. Both productions starred Ralph Richardson in the title roles. \nGwynn also appeared in a BBC serialised adaptation of Great Expectations as Joe Gargery in 1959.\nGwynn died on 29 January 1976 in London from a heart attack, aged 59.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 30", "response": ["*  1916 \u2013 Michael Gwynn, English actor "]}, {"page": "John Logie Baird", "response": ["He was played by Michael Gwynn (and also by Andrew Irvine, who played him as a boy) in the 1957 TV film A Voice in Vision and by Robert McIntosh in the 1986 TV drama The Fools on the Hill."]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["Cleese and Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) were supported by Connie Booth (Polly Sherman) and  Andrew Sachs (Manuel) in the two other major roles, with several actors regularly appearing in further supporting roles including Ballard Berkeley (Major Gowen), Brian Hall (Chef Terry), and Renee Roberts (Miss Gatsby) with Gilly Flower (Miss Tibbs).
