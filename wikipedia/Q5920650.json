The team played 63 competitive matches, winning 31, drawing 12 (including one decided by a penalty shoot-out), and losing 20.  Tony Cascarino was the club's leading goalscorer, with 30 goals in all competitions. Howard Pritchard and Paul Haylock made the most appearances; both played in 62 of the club's 63 matches.  The highest attendance recorded at the club's home ground, Priestfield Stadium, was 16,775, for the home leg of the play-off final.", "Following the resolution of the issues behind the scenes, Peacock signed six new players before the season began.  In July, midfielder Trevor Quow joined from Peterborough United for a transfer fee of \u00a38,500. The following month, Gillingham signed Howard Pritchard, a winger who had made one appearance for the Welsh national team in 1985, from Bristol City for a fee of \u00a322,500. Defender Graham Pearce and midfielder Mel Eves arrived from Brighton & Hove Albion and Sheffield United respectively on free transfers, and the club paid semi-professional club Welling United a fee of \u00a33,000 to sign winger Dave Smith.  Defender Paul Haylock signed for \u00a325,000 from Norwich City, having rejected a new contract shortly after helping the team win the Second Division championship. Several players left the club, including defender Mel Sage, one of the club's most promising young players, who joined Derby County of the Second Division for a fee of \u00a360,000.  Gillingham had hoped for a significantly higher fee, but with the two clubs unable to agree on terms, the transfer fee had to be set by an independent tribunal. Karl Elsey came close to leaving the club, but failed to agree a contract with Reading and so remained at Gillingham. The team prepared for the new season with several friendly matches, including a testimonial match for the long-serving Weatherly, for which Tottenham Hotspur of the First Division provided the opposition.  The team retained the first-choice kit worn in the previous season of blue shirts with a white panel down each side.  The second-choice shirts to be worn in the event of a clash of colours with the opposition changed from plain red to white with a blue zig-zag band across the chest."]}]}}
