Gillian Beattie-Smith, Women's History Review 22(2), April 2013. DOI: 10.1080/09612025.2012.726110. Beattie-Smith gives the date of the marriage as 12 May, Sarah Hazlitt's death year as 1843 (she was born in 1774). According to Duncan Wu, they were married on 1 May 1808 and Sarah Hazlitt died in 1840. See Wu, pp. 123, 438. a friend of Mary Lamb and sister of John Stoddart, a journalist who became editor of The Times newspaper in 1814. Shortly before the wedding, John Stoddart established a trust into which he began paying \u00a3100 per year, for the benefit of Hazlitt and his wife\u2014this was a very generous gesture, but Hazlitt detested being supported by his brother-in-law, whose political beliefs he despised.Wu 2008, pp. 118, 160, 221. This union was not a love match, and incompatibilities would later drive the couple apart; yet, for a while, it seemed to work well enough, and their initial behavior was both playful and affectionate. Miss Stoddart, an unconventional woman, accepted Hazlitt and tolerated his eccentricities just as he, with his own somewhat offbeat individualism, accepted her. Together they made an agreeable social foursome with the Lambs, who visited them when they set up a household in Winterslow, a village a few miles from Salisbury, Wiltshire, in southern England. The couple had three sons over the next few years, Only one of their children, William, born in 1811, survived infancy. (He in turn fathered William Carew Hazlitt.)Maclean covers the marriage at length, pp. 233\u201375; for a briefer account, see Wardle, pp. 103\u201321.", "*The Selected Writings of William Hazlitt. 9 vols.

His writings criticise the persistence of Catholic doctrines in the Anglican church which, in Hazlitt's view, have no basis in scripture. As a Unitarian, he also rejected the Trinity, and instead offered a form of religious faith \"founded in reason\". The rejection of the established church, and of religious hierarchies, was also central to Hazlitt's doctrine. He even called on parliament to adopt his form of Unitarianism, revealing the extent to which his religious beliefs had a politically radical edge.Burley 2010, pp. 264\u20136. The literary critic Tom Paulin has also highlighted Hazlitt's political radicalism, associating him with the \"Real Whig\" political tendency that developed from the commonwealthmen of the seventeenth century, and which was characterised by republican beliefs.Paulin 1998, pp. 3\u20134. A friend of Hazlitt described him as \"an ultra-Dissenter, and in politics a republican\".Paulin 1998, p. 2.", "Hazlitt's sympathy with the American cause, and the threats of physical harm which he received in Ireland, led him to emigrate to America in April 1783, sailing on the first ship which departed following the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War.Moyne 1964, p. 297. The Hazlitt family first lived in Philadelphia, where they were doubly stricken with loss. Harriet died in June at about eighteen months old. Another daughter, Esther, the last of the seven Hazlitt children, was born a few weeks later, only to die in September. Their loss was noted to have deeply affected their father.Wu 2008, pp. 27\u20138. Hazlitt failed to find a post as a minister in Philadelphia, and Duncan Wu has argued that this influenced the condemnatory tone of Hazlitt's preface to his edited collection of three pamphlets by Joseph Priestley. The collection was issued by Robert Bell, the publisher of Thomas Paine's Common Sense.Wu 2006, pp. 222\u20133. Indeed, the publication of Hazlitt's edition of Priestley's writings was motivated by the need to publish a profitable work, which would make up for the losses that Common Sense incurred.Wu 2006, pp. 223\u20136. Hazlitt used Bell to distribute unsold copies of a pamphlet that he had published in 1773, which provided him with much-needed income.Wu 2006, p. 223."]}, {"page": "Peter Bell (Wordsworth)", "response": ["Even close friends could offer little comfort. Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth that though he liked the poem's subject \"I cannot say that the style of it quite satisfies me. It is too lyrical,\" and he privately said that he thought it one of the worst of Wordsworth's works. Henry Crabb Robinson feared Wordsworth had \"set himself back ten years by the publication of this unfortunate work\". Gill 1990, p. 332. In the months after the publication of Wordsworth's poem and Reynolds' skit a whole rash of Wordsworth parodies broke out, by Keats and Shelley among others.  Wordsworth responded to this general damnation of Peter Bell by revising it when he included it in his 1820 collected edition, Miscellaneous Poems, though he also wrote a sonnet \"On the Detraction which followed the Publication of a certain Poem\" in which he told Peter \"Heed not such onset!\".Gill 1990, pp. 336\u2013337.  Opinion was slow to change in Peter Bell\u2019s favour. In 1879 Matthew Arnold counted it among the poems which only a true Wordsworthian such as himself could read with pleasure, and in 1891 Oscar Wilde cited it as an example of the deleterious influence of Nature on Wordsworth's poetry.  Modern Wordsworth critics generally rank Peter Bell high among its author's works, full credit being given to its daring as a \"radical experiment\".  Duncan Wu numbered it among Wordsworth's greatest poems, while Mary Moorman called it \"his most brilliant narrative poem\"."]}, {"page": "Table-Talk", "response": ["Table-Talk is a collection of essays by the English cultural critic and social commentator William Hazlitt. It was originally published as two volumes, the first of which appeared in April 1821.Bate 2004. The essays deal with topics such as art, literature and philosophy. Duncan Wu has described the essays as the \"pinnacle of [Hazlitt's] achievement\", and argues that Table-Talk and The Plain Speaker (1826) represent Hazlitt's masterpiece.Wu 2008, pp. 284, 296."]}, {"page": "2014 in poetry", "response": ["*Carolyn Forch\u00e9 & Duncan Wu, editors.

Huet also highlights several instances where Percy had replaced Mary's more plain diction with his own vocabulary, calling this \"unimpeachable evidence\" that Percy was\u2014as Rieger claimed\u2014at least a minor collaborator. She argues that Percy is responsible for the novel's themes of human procreation and sterility, and credits Percy for developing the contrast between the characters of Victor and Elizabeth, and the idea that Frankenstein should travel to England to create a female partner for his monster. Editor Duncan Wu disputes this, claiming that Mary had already established both ideas, and that Percy only suggested that the trip to England should be Victor's own idea, not his father's."]}, {"page": "Political Essays", "response": ["The immediate reception of Political Essays was, to quote Duncan Wu, \"disappointing\". Sales were slow, and few contemporary politicians mention the work in their private writings. Later critics such as Herschel Baker in 1962 found the volume \"angry and uneven\"."]}]}}
