While his birth name was Ren\u00e9 Lodge Brabazon Raymond, he was well known by his various pseudonyms, including James Hadley Chase, James L. Docherty, Raymond Marshall, R. Raymond, and Ambrose Grant. He was one of the best known thriller writers of all time. The canon of Chase, comprising 90 titles, earned him a reputation as the king of thriller writers in Europe. He was also one of the internationally best-selling authors, and to date 50 of his books have been made into films.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Detective fiction", "response": ["In the late 1930s, Raymond Chandler updated the form with his private detective Philip Marlowe, who brought a more intimate voice to the detective than the more distanced \"operative's report\" style of Hammett's Continental Op stories. Despite struggling through the task of plotting a story, his cadenced dialogue and cryptic narrations were musical, evoking the dark alleys and tough thugs, rich women and powerful men about whom he wrote. Several feature and television movies have been made about the Philip Marlowe character. James Hadley Chase wrote a few novels with private eyes as the main heroes, including Blonde's Requiem (1945), Lay Her Among the Lilies (1950), and Figure It Out for Yourself (1950). The heroes of these novels are typical private eyes, very similar to or plagiarizing Raymond Chandler's work."]}, {"page": "February 6", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 James Hadley Chase, English-Swiss soldier and author (b. 1906)"]}, {"page": "1906", "response": ["* December 24 \u2013 James Hadley Chase, English writer (d. 1985)"]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 6 || James Hadley Chase || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 78 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Writer, Miscellaneous || style=\"text-align:left;\"| "]}, {"page": "1985 in literature", "response": ["*February 6 \u2013 James Hadley Chase, English thriller novelist (born 1906)"]}, {"page": "1939 in literature", "response": ["*James Hadley Chase \u2013 No Orchids for Miss Blandish"]}, {"page": "1951 in literature", "response": ["*James Hadley Chase \u2013 But a Short Time to Live"]}, {"page": "1954 in literature", "response": ["* James Hadley Chase \u2013 The Sucker Punch"]}, {"page": "1959 in literature", "response": ["*James Hadley Chase \u2013 The World in My Pocket"]}, {"page": "1961 in literature", "response": ["*James Hadley Chase \u2013 A Lotus for Miss Quon"]}, {"page": "List of crime writers", "response": ["*James Hadley Chase (1906\u20131985, E/Sw)"]}, {"page": "List of films considered the worst", "response": ["No Orchids for Miss Blandish, a British gangster film adapted from the 1939 novel by James Hadley Chase, received a very hostile reception from the press. This was mainly due to the film's high (for the time) level of sexual and violent content, but also because its attempt to portray Americans using a largely British cast (including an early role for Sid James) was seen as unconvincing. The British film journal Monthly Film Bulletin called it \"the most sickening exhibition of brutality, perversion, sex and sadism ever to be shown on a cinema screen\". The Sunday Express film reviewer called No Orchids for Miss Blandish \"the worst film I have ever seen\". The Australian newspaper The Age also gave a harsh review: \"No Orchids for Miss Blandish is not only a disgrace to the studio that made it, but it also reflects on the British industry as a whole ... the entire production is unpardonable.\" Cliff Goodwin, discussing No Orchids For Miss Blandish's initial reception, notes it was \"unanimously dubbed 'the worst film ever made. Later reviews of the film were equally antipathetic. No Orchids for Miss Blandish was described by British film reviewer Leslie Halliwell as a \"hilariously awful gangster film ... one of the worst films ever made\".
