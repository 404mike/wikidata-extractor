He can play either as a midfielder or as a striker.\nAfter many years at the Leicester City Academy, he turned professional at the club in 2006. He spent the 2006\u201307 season on loan at Conference side Northwich Victoria and League Two club Rochdale. He then spent the entirety of the 2007\u201308 campaign on loan at Lincoln City. He turned down a new deal with Leicester to sign for Port Vale in July 2008. He helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313 with seven goals in 36 matches. He ended his eight-year spell at Port Vale when he joined league rivals Shrewsbury Town in May 2016. He left Shrewsbury for Chesterfield in January 2018, who were relegated out of the English Football League at the end of the season. He returned to Port Vale on loan for the first half of the 2018\u201319 season, and then moved on to Chorley in August 2019. He signed with Hednesford Town in July 2020 and then returned to Stoke-on-Trent to join Hanley Town in May 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 8", "response": ["*1986 \u2013 Louis Dodds, English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Louis Dodds, football player"]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["Building for the 2018\u201319 season, Aspin released ten players and transfer-listed a further four, whilst bringing in ten new signings and five loan players.

The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch.

This was followed by a thirteen-game barren spell, which was ended by three goals in four games, including a strike that took the club into the Third Round of the FA Cup. The Richards duo's partnership was ended in January when Marc suffered a thigh injury; upon his recovery Justin was dropped to make way for loan striker Tom Pope. Richards scored his first hat-trick in the English Football League on 30 April, along with Louis Dodds, in a 7\u20132 win over Morecambe.

However a 4\u20131 home defeat to Macclesfield Town two days later would prove to be Sinnott's last game in charge. He was sacked two days later, with the \"Valiants\" lying in 16th place. Three months on from his sacking, the club were yet to reach a compensation settlement with Sinnott, before an agreement was reached in February 2009. The club went on to finish the season in 18th place under Dean Glover.

Gannon had previously told the press his staff were 'underqualified', though insisted any changes would be 'implemented at a later stage' and that Horsfield was a 'great assistant'. This came on the same day that local paper The Sentinel ran an editorial that questioned his loan signings, his decision to drop Gary Roberts and branded his tactics and team selections as baffling. After Horsfield was told to stay away from the club for two weeks he was invited back to his assistant role as before, with no disciplinary action taken against either party. As the club fell to seventh in the tale, Gannon made another loan signing by bringing Dominic Blizzard in from Bristol Rovers. Results continued to go against the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3\u20130 at Accrington Stanley, and as a result dropped out of the play-off zone for the first time in the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media \"I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him\". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out. These rumours were proved accurate two days later, as Gannon's departure was confirmed by the club. Loan signing Blizzard also left. Mark Grew took over as caretaker-manager, though following a 2 April defeat to leaders Chesterfield he was forced to admit that automatic promotion was now out of reach.
