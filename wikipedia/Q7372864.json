This report was influenced by the ideology of managerialism - the idea that problems could be solved by 'management'. Griffiths firmly believed that many of the problems facing the Welfare State were caused by the lack of strong effective leadership and management. Because of this previous work, which was greatly admired by the Prime Minister, Griffiths was asked to examine the whole system of community care. In 1988 he produced a report or a Green Paper called 'Community Care: Agenda for Action', also known as The Griffiths Report."]}, {"page": "1983 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Roy Griffiths presents his report on general management of the National Health Service."]}, {"page": "Sir Roy Griffiths", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roy Griffiths"]}, {"page": "The Orme Academy", "response": ["* Sir Ernest Roy Griffiths"]}, {"page": "1985 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Ernest Roy Griffiths.
