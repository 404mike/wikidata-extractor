Since 1965, An American Dream has been defended by Mailer's critics, some of which call it one of his better novels. Tony Tanner posits that a few critics likely found An American Dream to be \"outrageous\" due to their perception of it as a simple narrative and not as a surrealist work. Tanner hailed Leo Bersani's review of An American Dream as a \"brilliant comment on the novel as a whole\" because Bersani recognized the purposeful \"exuberance\" that Mailer used."]}, {"page": "Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt", "response": ["* Tony Tanner as Burgess Meredith / Penguin"]}, {"page": "Stop the World \u2013 I Want to Get Off", "response": ["A 1966 Warner Bros. release was little more than a filmed version of a staged production.
