Soon, up to 1,600\u00a0tons of material was being removed each day, and the level of the beach began to drop, much to the alarm of local residents. The Board of Trade agreed to establish a local inquiry in response to protests from villagers, who feared that the dredging might destabilise the beach and thereby threaten the village. The inquiry found that the activity was not likely to pose a significant threat to the village, so dredging continued. By 1900, however, the level of the beach had started to fall. In 1900's autumn storms, part of the sea wall was washed away. In November 1900, villagers petitioned their Member of Parliament complaining of damage to their houses, and in March 1901 Kingsbridge Rural District Council wrote to the Board of Trade complaining of damage to the road. In September 1901 a new Board of Trade inspector concluded that further severe storms could cause serious damage and recommended that dredging be stopped. On 8\u00a0January 1902 the dredging licence was revoked. During 1902 the level of the beach recovered, but 1902 winter brought more storms and damage."]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir John Jackson; MP for Devonport (1910\u20131918) ", "*John Jackson; MP for South East Derbyshire (1959\u20131964) "]}, {"page": "Jackson (name)", "response": ["*John Jackson (writer), British screenwriter", "*John Jackson (born 1977), American rapper, known as Fabolous", "*John Jackson (blues musician) (1924\u20132002), American blues musician", "*John Jackson (Derbyshire politician) (1919\u20131976), British politician", "*Sir John Jackson (engineer) (1851\u20131919), British politician", "*John Jackson (Tampa) (1809\u20131887), 9th mayor of Tampa, Florida", "*John Jackson (law professor) (1932\u20132015), law professor at Georgetown University", "*Frederick John Jackson (1859\u20131929), English explorer and ornithologist", "*John Jackson (astronomer) (1887\u20131958), Scottish astronomer", "*John Jackson (English boxer) (1769\u20131845), English boxer", "*John Jackson (Virgin Islands boxer) (born 1989), U.S. Virgin Islands boxer", "*John Jackson (cricketer, born 1833) (1833\u20131901), English cricketer", "*John Jackson (Lancashire cricketer) (1841\u20131906), English cricketer", "*John Jackson (Worcestershire cricketer) (1880\u20131968), English cricketer", "*John Jackson (Somerset cricketer) (1898\u20131958), Chilean cricketer", "*John Jackson (footballer, born 1923), English footballer", "*John Jackson (footballer, born 1942), English footballer", "*John Jackson (Scottish footballer) (1906\u20131965), Scottish footballer", "*John Jackson (offensive tackle) (born 1965), American football player", "*John Jackson (wide receiver) (born 1967), American football player", "*John Jackson (painter) (1778\u20131831), British painter", "*John Jackson (bishop) (1811\u20131886), English bishop"]}, {"page": "1904 Devonport by-election", "response": ["The local Conservative Association selected 53-year-old Sir John Jackson as their candidate to defend the seat.

In later years Lancaster said that he had served in the Boer War, but in his profile interview in the Canadian Bookseller, he does not refer to the war, but only to strange experience and unpleasant adventures centering on strike-breaking and hunting.Born in 1880, he was unlikely to have started work for Sir John Jackson until 1896 (when works on Keyham started) or 1897 when he would have been 17, a normal age for finishing Public School. He worked for John Jackson for six years, meaning that the earliest he could have gone to South Africa was March or April 1902. The Second Boer War was virtually over at that stage, formally ending on 31 May 1902. Further in his enlistment papers in December 1914, Lancaster stated that he had been three years in the Border Mounted Rifles, and had resigned on 6 January 1906, again suggesting that his service in this volunteer unit had begun after the end of the Second Boer War."]}]}}
