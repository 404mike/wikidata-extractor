He became professor of anatomy and obstetrics at Calcutta Medical College and was later involved in the training of several Indian medical students on his return to the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Soorjo Coomar Goodeve Chuckerbutty", "response": ["Orphaned at the age of six, his aspirations for an English education led him to the Hare School and then entry into medicine at the Medical College of Bengal, where, under the guidance of retired professor of anatomy and obstetrics Henry Goodeve and funding from the government, he was one of the first four Brahmin medical students taken to England in 1845 for further medical training. Upon return to India in 1850, despite his achievements being celebrated and supported by some of his British colleagues, he was prohibited from taking up a senior post in the IMS. When the announcement to open the IMS examination to 'all' came in 1854, Chuckerbutty took the opportunity to take it and passed in second place.", "Challenging Hindu prejudices against touching dead bodies had been instigated in the previous decade when CMC\u2019s first anatomy professor, Henry Goodeve demonstrated anatomy to his first cohort of Hindu students in the 1830s. It was most likely as a result of his influence that Chuckerbuttty himself added \"Goodeve\" to his own name, inserting it before his surname, and his [Henry Goodeve's] recommendation that he gained entry into the then new Medical College of Bengal (CMC), at his second attempt in 1844. The College had been established in 1835 by M. J. Bramley, who was an advocate of travelling fellowships for bright students, and at the request of Goodeve, who had been proposing the extension of medical training to certain Hindus and who had offered to bear costs for one student, plans materialised for one such trip.", "File:Henry Goodeve.png|Henry Goodeve"]}, {"page": "Madhusudan Gupta", "response": ["In 1835, he was transferred to the new CMC, where he was fundamental in gathering Indian support for practical anatomy and in breaking down Hindu taboos on touching the dead, consequently taking sole responsibility for the first human dissection, performed under the guidance of Professor Henry Goodeve and assisted by four other Hindu students. Controversies regarding the exact date of the first procedure, whether other students had performed it before and whether a military salute was given, remain. Despite any discrepancies, this singular act of dissection has become symbolic of the move of western medicine into India.", "thumb|Henry Goodeve", "A committee set up by the East India Company (EIC) in 1833, regarded the training of Kolkata's medical staff as unsatisfactory. As a consequence, the Ayurvedic and Yunani courses taught at the Sanskrit College and the School for Native Doctors\u2019, both originally established by the EIC, were abolished. The plan was to replace them with a fully equipped Medical College, to educate and train the natives in \"the art of healing\". Newly founded in March 1835, Gupta was transferred to the CMC, as a native teacher, where he became involved in the execution of the first entrance examinations and where he also assisted Henry Goodeve and William Brooke O'Shaughnessy.", "The obstacles to the study of practical anatomy were not unique to India. England had its own qualms regarding acceptance of human dissection and difficulties in obtaining bodies. British anatomy students were increasingly looking to France for training and the emphasis on knowing the anatomy of the body, diseased or otherwise, on being a competent abled physician or surgeon was strongly felt by western medicine. This conviction, the 1834 report on the state of medical education in Bengal, along with the resulting formation of the CMC and its then affiliation with University College London, all played their part towards meeting the growing need of trained native doctors for a mounting British army. Adding to this, the persistence of Lord William Bentinck, Henry Goodeve and others and the surrounding abundant supply of dead bodies in Kolkata, created a passage for practical anatomy from Europe to India. All that was then needed was Indian acceptance."]}, {"page": "Vivian Green-Armytage", "response": ["He co-authored the fifth edition of Birch's Management and Medical Treatment of Children in India with Charles Robert Mortimer Green which was published by Thacker Spink & Co., in Calcutta in 1913.

Charles Bell had been vice consul of the British trade mission in Siam since 1857, arriving with Charlotte in Bangkok two years after the British pressured the King of Siam to sign the Bowring Treaty, opening the country to foreign trade. Bell was orphaned when she was only six months old, with both Charles and Charlotte dying within a week of each other in September 1859 from unknown causes (likely disease). Bell was left in the care of Charlotte's brother John Goodeve in England, a medical student at Queen's College, Cambridge. He in turn placed Bell in the care of his childless uncle, Henry Goodeve, and his wife Isabel (n\u00e9e Barlow). Goodeve had turned to philanthropy after retiring as a military doctor, and among his many roles in Bristol civil society he was president of the board of a home for orphaned children. While Bell is recorded as the Goodeve's \"daughter\" in the 1861 census, whether this reflected a formal adoption is unclear \u2013 Bell was listed instead as a \"great-niece\" in the 1871 census, and the census records also show that the Goodeves took in several other children from both the Barlow and Goodeve sides of the family.", "When Henry Goodeve died in 1884, Bell was an executor of his estate. She used her inheritance as capital to establish her own stockbroking business in Bristol, but by 1886 moved to London. That year's edition of The Englishwoman's Review noted that Bell, \"whom we mentioned on a former occasion as intending to settle in London in the hitherto untried profession for a woman of stock and share broker, has an office at 1, Russell Chambers, Bury Street, Bloomsbury.\" "]}]}}
