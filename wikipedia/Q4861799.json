In 2018, the Countryside Alliance's Chief Executive, Tim Bonner, argued that despite the intervention and recommendations by the Charity Commission, the RSPCA had not changed. In a 2013 interview with The Daily Telegraph, the Alliance's executive chairman, Lieutenant General Sir Barney White-Spunner, called the RSPCA a \"sinister and nasty\" organisation and urged Alliance members to stop donating to it. The RSPCA responded by saying: \"Sir Barney White-Spunner's interview shows once again how far out of touch he and his colleagues at the pro bloodsports Countryside Alliance are with the reality of public opinion in this country.\" The Alliance has also criticised the RSPB and called for the sacking of TV presenter Chris Packham."]}, {"page": "Honourable Artillery Company", "response": ["* Lieutenant General Sir Barney White-Spunner (2010\u20132013)"]}, {"page": "Operation Telic", "response": ["The Royal Air Force commander was Air Vice-Marshal Glenn Torpy.

After political intersession with Prime minister Tony Blair, the SAS were given a direct-action task \u2013 the destruction of an al-Qaeda-linked opium plant in southern Afghanistan, their mission was codenamed Operation Trent. Both A and G squadron successfully completed the mission in 4 hours with only 4 soldiers wounded, it marked the regiments first wartime HALO parachute jump and the operation was the largest British SAS operation in history. Following Operation Trent, the SAS were deployed on uneventful reconnaissance tasks in the Dasht-e Margo desert, returning to Hereford in mid-December 2001; however, small numbers of Territorial SAS from both regiments remained in the country to provide close protection for members of MI6.
