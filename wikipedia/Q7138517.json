Large emissions of firedamp were commonplace. Ten years earlier the 400-strong workforce went on strike for ten weeks because of alleged management incompetence but had to resume work when starvation loomed. During a bitter dispute in 1864, blackleg labour was used and striking miners and their families were evicted from their homes. Gas made men giddy and faint.  Men would not take safety lamps near the goaves.  According to Tomlinson the underviewers had chalked \"FIRE\" in places. Parkin Jeffcock, the mining engineer who attended after the explosion, agreed that the fireman had written \"FIRE\" but said it was not unusual.", "A message was sent to colliery engineer Thomas Woodhouse of Duffield near Derby. It said, \"The Oaks Pit is on fire. Come directly.\" Woodhouse was in London but his partner, Parkin Jeffcock, responded and arrived by train before 10\u00a0pm.", "A monument to those killed in the disaster was erected at Christ Church, Ardsley in Barnsley in 1879.
