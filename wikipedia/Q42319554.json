On holiday in 1909 in Clovelly Court, Devon the Asquiths were followed by suffragettes Elsie Howey, Jessie Kenney and Vera Wentworth, whom Margot recognised again at church and they also hid in her garden, covering plants with the colours of the movement purple, white and green. She attended the debate on the aborted Conciliation Bill with other politicians wives, and in 1911 she  'seemed highly amused at the earnestness' of women's suffrage lobbyists, whilst near to Constance Lytton and Annie Kenney, who remembered her as unpleasant and sarcastic . In 2012 an article in Votes for Women told of Asquith's 'stealth' journey when travelling with her husband as Prime Minister via Wolverhampton and Holyhead ferry to Dublin, when their ferry was still met by a yacht of Irish Women's Franchise League demanding the female vote be included in the Irish Home Rule Bill."]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["* Vera Wentworth (1890\u20131957) \u2013 went to Holloway for the cause and was force fed.

In 1908 he visited Vera Wentworth in prison. In the discussions before the Representation of the People Act 1918, Maud Palmer, Countess of Selborne of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association contacted Bull, at the prompting of Millicent Fawcett, to propose a franchise at the 1916 Speaker's Conference called to start a franchise bill. He involved himself in the question of the minimum age at which a woman should be allowed to vote, starting the bidding with 40, which he later claimed had some support. That was certainly not from the Pankhursts, who held out for adult suffrage. The conference settled by 15 votes to 6 on a minimum age of 30. In 1918 Bull drafted a bill to allow for female conscription. He was admitted to the Privy Council that year."]}, {"page": "Suffragette", "response": ["* Vera Wentworth"]}, {"page": "Wentworth (surname)", "response": ["* Vera Wentworth (1890 \u2013 1957), British suffragist"]}, {"page": "Elsie Howey", "response": ["Howey joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a militant suffrage organisation, in 1907. In February 1908, she and her sister, Mary Gertrude Howey, were arrested alongside other WSPU members after hiding in a pantechnicon van that was driven into the House of Commons. After her release, she joined Annie Kenney and Mary Blathwayt to campaign at a by-election in Shropshire in May 1908. Soon afterwards, she was imprisoned again for three months for protesting outside the home of then-Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was sentenced to six weeks in jail. Her demonstrations became more daring, including hiding overnight in the organ at Colston Hall, Bristol before Augustine Birrell, MP  was due to speak, assisted by Vera Holme inside and Minnie Baldock.    She went further on 5 September 1910, when Howey and two other suffragettes, Vera Wentworth and Jessie Kenney, assaulted Prime Minister Asquith and Herbert Gladstone while the men were playing golf, and pursued Asquith to his holiday home, left protest cards, saying 'Release Patricia Woodlock' and other suffragette materials in his private garden. Howey's violent tactics were criticised by some other members of the WSPU who called for her removal from the union. The actions proved too much for Mary Blathwayt's family. Her mother, Emily, resigned from the WSPU and her father, Linley, wrote letters of protest to Christabel Pankhurst, Howey and Wentworth. Pankhurst was told that Howey and Wentworth could not visit their house again.

She was among the welcoming party for another released prisoner Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, in April 1909, with the Pankhursts, two Kenney sisters, Vera Wentworth, Minnie Baldock and Mary Gawthorpe. They were taken to join 500 suffragettes at a celebration lunch at the Criterion, Picadilly Circus restaurant.  Phillips was arrested later in 1909 again with Vera Wentworth and Elsie Howie for attempting to force their attendance at a men's meeting in Exeter where Lord Carrington in charge of the Agriculture and Fisheries Board was speaking. During her seven days imprisoned she went on hunger strike and was released after four days 'in a dangerous state'. Other WSPU leaders Mary Blathwayt, Emily Blathwayt, wrote in their diaries about Phillips suffering from fainting, and Emmeline Pankhurst wrote to her \"my dear girl take care of yourself and do everything in your power to recover your health and strength.\"  Phillips also carried out  what Christabel Pankhurst called a 'splendid protest' showing ' pluck and ingenuity' by hiding under the stage overnight, jumping out shouting 'Votes for Women' and objecting to Patricia Woodlock's imprisonment when two Cabinet Ministers were being awarded honorary degrees in Liverpool St George's Hall."]}, {"page": "Violet Bland", "response": ["In Bristol, Bland became active in the Women's Social and Political Union (the 'Suffragettes').

Despite their real concerns about the physical damage to property and the risk to hurting innocent people, the Blathwayts continued to support their daughter's activism and to welcome suffragette visitors and support the eventual achievement of votes for women.
