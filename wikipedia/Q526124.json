It would not prove a successful event; engine failure forced the team to retire both Hughes' car, and their other TVR, driven by Richard Dean, Patrick Pearce and Marc Hynes. He would remain with Team LNT for the remainder of the season. Following the Sebring race, Hughes, now partnered by Pearce, entered the Donington Park round of the 2005 British GT season, finishing second, a race which was followed by a class victory in the 1000\u00a0 km of Spa, where Hughes was partnered by Kane. Hughes and Pearce then competed in the FIA GT Magny-Cours Supercar 500, finishing 18th overall, and seventh in class\u00a0\u2013 fifth of the drivers who scored points for the British GT Championship. The duo remained together for the Knockhill and Thruxton rounds, with a second place in the first race held at Thruxton being the strongest result out of the four races. Hughes then returned to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time in three years, this time driving for the RML Group team, driving their MG-Lola EX264 alongside Tommy Erdos and Mike Newton. The race proved far more successful than his two previous events, and the trio won the LMP2 category. He returned to Team LNT for the rest of the season, and although the team had entered two cars in the Castle Combe round of the British GT Championship, neither actually competed in a race, following car No.42's exclusion for failing noise limits, and indeed the team withdrew from the remainder of the series for this reason. Following this withdrawal, the team returned to the Le Mans Series, (the 1000\u00a0km of Spa, which they had previously entered, was part of this series) resulting in the team having competed in all five events. However, the class victory in Spa would remain their only success, as Hughes, partnered by Kane (and, for the final race, Tomlinson) failed to finish in any of the remaining events, following engine failure at the 1000\u00a0km of Monza, throttle issues at both the 1000km of Silverstone and the 1000\u00a0km of Istanbul, and suspension failure at the 1000\u00a0km of N\u00fcrburgring. The solitary victory meant that Hughes and Kane finished 11th in class at the end of the season.", "|align=\"left\"|  Thomas Erdos Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2003 1000 km of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Thomas Erdos Mike Newton Chris Goodwin"]}, {"page": "2006 Le Mans Series", "response": ["|  Thomas Erdos Mike Newton", "|  Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Istanbul", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Thomas Erdos Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Spa", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Thomas Erdos Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of N\u00fcrburgring", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Donington", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos"]}, {"page": "2005 Le Mans Endurance Series", "response": ["|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos"]}, {"page": "2004 Le Mans Endurance Series", "response": ["|   Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Jarama", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Thomas Erdos Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2007 Le Mans Series", "response": ["|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos", "|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos", "|  Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2005 FIA GT Championship", "response": ["|  Mike Newton", "|align=left|  Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2004 FIA GT Championship", "response": ["|  Mike Newton", "|align=left|  Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2003 FIA GT Championship", "response": ["|  Mike Newton", "|align=left|  Mike Newton"]}, {"page": "2005 1000 km of Spa", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos"]}, {"page": "2007 Rolex Sports Car Series", "response": ["| rowspan=2 |  Mike Newton Tommy Erdos Harrison Brix"]}, {"page": "2005 Spa 24 Hours", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos Michael Mallock Phil Bennett"]}, {"page": "2007 1000 km of Monza", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos"]}, {"page": "2007 24 Hours of Daytona", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"|  Mike Newton Thomas Erdos Harrison Brix Eddie Cheever"]}, {"page": "MG-Lola EX257", "response": ["* Mike Newton / Ray Mallock Ltd.
