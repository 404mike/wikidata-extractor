Six minutes in, Ipswich's Marcus Stewart flicked a long ball on to Naylor who delayed his shot before passing it past Miller to make the score 2\u20131.  Removing his shirt to celebrate, Naylor was shown the yellow card by referee Heilbron.  Further good work from Naylor saw his cross poorly cleared by Keith Brown, only for Jermaine Wright to miss the resulting chance to score.  Two minutes later, in the 57th minute, Naylor played a ball out wide to Jamie Clapham who crossed for Stewart to head in Ipswich's third goal. Barnsley made their first substitution of the game on 60 minutes with South African Eric Tinkler being replaced by Geoff Thomas.  Ipswich narrowly missed extending their lead as Mowbray headed a Magilton cross wide, before Barnsley's second substitution, this time Macedonian international striker Gjorgji Hristov coming on to replace Dyer.  After a chance for Hristov, Barnsley's third and final substitution was made in the 71st minute, John Curtis being substituted for Nicky Eaden.  Magilton's 72nd minute free kick was deflected off the Barnsley wall, and a Neil Shipperley shot was saved by Wright, before a second Barnsley penalty was awarded in the 77th minute.  Mowbray was adjudged to have fouled Thomas as he moved through the box, and Hignett converted the penalty taking the score to 3\u20132 with just over ten minutes remaining.  With Ipswich beginning to appear nervous, Burley substituted Stewart off for Reuser in the 83rd minute.  Barnsley came close to equalising a minute later with Wright saving a point-blank header from Hristov, and then two minutes after that, catching another Barnsley opportunity.  An appeal for a penalty was turned down as Reuser went down in the area with two minutes remaining.  Not long after, Jermaine Wright was substituted off for Fabian Wilnis.  In the last minute of regular time, and with Barnsley sending their team forward, a break for Ipswich saw Reuser pick up the ball in his own half before running half the length of the pitch and striking the ball from the edge of the Barnsley area into the roof of the net, taking the score to 4\u20132.  Five minutes of injury time were played out with no further incident.", "|CM ||28||Keith Brown"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|34||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Keith Brown"]}]}}
