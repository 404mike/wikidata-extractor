A member of the Labour Party, she has been Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding in Keir Starmer's Opposition frontbench since 2020.\nPhillips was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Lucy Powell, the Shadow Education Secretary, in 2015. A vocal critic of the former Leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, Phillips resigned as a PPS in protest over Corbyn's leadership and said she would \"find it incredibly difficult\" to continue as an MP if Corbyn was re-elected as Labour leader. She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Corbyn in the 2016 leadership election. Phillips was a candidate for Labour leader in the 2020 leadership election but withdrew from the later stages of the contest.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["By April 2019, the British government had agreed an extension to Brexit with the EU until 31 October 2019, which would mean the UK would take part in the 2019 European Parliament elections. Candidates selected by UKIP to run in the election included right-wing YouTube personalities, Carl Benjamin and Mark Meechan. Benjamin had caused controversy by making \"inappropriate\" comments in 2016 about the rape threats to a female Labour MP Jess Phillips, with the UKIP Swindon Branch chair calling for him to be deselected. Videos made by Benjamin in which he used racist terms also caused controversy.  In May, the 2019 United Kingdom local elections saw UKIP lose around 80% of the seats it was defending. The party was criticised for failing \"to capitalise on the collapse of the Conservatives\" by commentators.

Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop tweeted: \"Hard left joining with far right in welcoming dictators \"liberating\" Aleppo. Absolute disgrace\". Other Labour MPs joining in the criticism were Stephen Doughty, Angela Smith, Ian Austin, Mike Gapes, Jess Phillips, Toby Perkins and Wes Streeting. Conservative MP George Osborne and Guardian writer Owen Jones also attacked the paper's headline. However, the paper rejected the criticism, stating that \"from a purely technical point of view, when a sovereign government reclaims territory previously held by enemy forces, that\u2019s called \"liberation\" whether we like the outcome or not\". Stop the War Coalition convener Lindsey German, and political commentator Peter Oborne defended the Star reporting of the issue, and questioned the dominant media narrative, respectively. Jeremy Corbyn said he \"disagreed\" with the headline, emphasising that he always advocated a ceasefire and \"a political settlement in Syria\". However, he refused to say he would never buy or read the paper again, saying; \"Listen, I buy lots of newspapers.
