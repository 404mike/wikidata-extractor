The Northern Alliance foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah was \"apoplectic\" as he considered the uninvited arrival to be a violation of sovereignty, and complained bitterly to the head of the CIA field office, threatening to resign if the British did not withdraw. As it happened, the British government did alert the deputy head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan that they were deploying troops to Bagram, albeit at short notice. Arriving on the first flight, Brigadier Graeme Lamb, then the Director Special Forces, simply ignored Abdullah and drove to the Panjshir Valley, where he paid his respects to Ahmad Shah Massoud's grave and held talks with Northern Alliance leaders. The British Foreign Secretary tried to reassure the Northern Alliance that the deployment was not a vanguard of a British peacekeeping army, but Northern Alliance leaders did not believe them; with the threat of the Northern Alliance opening fire on incoming RAF troop transports, the deployment was put on hold."]}, {"page": "Great Lives", "response": ["|Graeme Lamb, SAS commando"]}, {"page": "Kilchattan Bay", "response": ["*Graeme Lamb - holidayed here regularly."]}, {"page": "Director Special Forces", "response": ["* 2001\u20132003 Brigadier Graeme Lamb (late Queen's Own Highlanders)"]}, {"page": "Graeme Cameron Maxwell Lamb", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graeme Lamb"]}, {"page": "Jackson Institute for Global Affairs", "response": ["|Graeme Lamb"]}, {"page": "List of witnesses of the Iraq Inquiry", "response": ["*Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb \u2013 commander of multinational forces in south-eastern Iraq in 2003; later Senior British Military Representative, Iraq."]}, {"page": "2011 Bahraini uprising", "response": ["* British military general Graeme Lamb"]}, {"page": "Field Army (United Kingdom)", "response": ["|Graeme Lamb "]}]}}
