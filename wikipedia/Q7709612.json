As well as his father's ability, Thomas' younger brother Benjamin Barker II (1776\u20131838) was also a talented artist known for his landscape work. Benjamin II exhibited at the Royal Academy and many of his works were engraved by Thales Fielding in aquatint. Barker's son, Thomas Jones Barker (1815\u20131882), followed his father and uncle into painting, studying at the studio of Horace Vernet in Paris. Many of Jones Barker's works were of a military nature, including Lord Clive's relief of Lucknow and The Allied generals before Sebastopol."]}, {"page": "William Callow", "response": ["Callow was born in Greenwich on 28 July 1812. He was apprenticed to the artist Copley Fielding, where he learnt the technique of plein air sketching.Hargraves, p.184; Macfall, p.63. He went on to study under Theodore and Thales Fielding, where he learnt to colour prints and make aquatints,Hargraves, p.184. and was taught water colour painting between 1825-7.", "In 1829 Thales Fielding found him work as an engraver in Paris, where he worked alongside his friend Charles Bentley. While in the French capital he was encouraged by Thomas Shotter Boys to take up watercolours again. After exhibiting a watercolour of Richmond Hill in the Paris salon of 1831, he was offered a job teaching the family of King Louis Philippe I of France, and for several years gave lessons to the Duc de Nemours and Princess Cl\u00e9mentine, while his own works rapidly gained popularity in England. This was helped by his influence over Francois, prince de Joinville during the turbulence of the July Revolution.  Briefly the 'Callow youth' was plunged into a platonic love affair that went unrequited with the darling Princess Clementine.Mallalieu, Vive, Country Life, p.89"]}, {"page": "Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding", "response": ["Fielding was the eldest son of Nathan Theodore Fielding. Like his brothers Copley and Thales he painted in watercolours, and in 1799 sent to the Royal Academy A View of the North Tyne, near Billingham, Northumberland. In 1814 he sent to the British Institution A Sleeping Bacchus. He continued to exhibit at both exhibitions, but it is sometimes difficult to distinguish his works from those of his younger brother, Thales Fielding."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Barker (painter)", "response": ["Barker was the son of Benjamin and brother of Thomas Barker, called \u2018Barker of Bath,\u2019 resided at Bath, Somerset and between 1800 and 1821 exhibited occasionally at the Royal Academy. During the years 1813\u201320 he was a large exhibitor of views and landscape compositions at the Watercolour Society. He was also an exhibitor at the British Institution. There are three of his watercolour drawings in the South Kensington Museum. He was an artist of some skill and taste, but little power or originality. He died at Totnes after a lingering illness, 2 March 1838, aged 62. Thales Fielding engraved forty-eight of his landscapes in aquatint."]}, {"page": "Henry Williamson Lugard", "response": ["Henry Lugard trained at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich from 1827 to 1831.
