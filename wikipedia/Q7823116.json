He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. \nHe played for Essex and Derbyshire County Cricket Club  between 2003 and 2020. He was not re-engaged by Derbyshire following the end of the 2020 season. Palladino subsequently sued Derbyshire,  claiming wrongful dismissal and discrimination on the grounds of mental health. Having been the county's leading wicket taker over the 2018 and 2019 seasons, a long-standing mental health issue prevented him playing in 2020; Derbyshire then declined to offer him a new contract.
