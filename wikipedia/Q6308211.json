She had three hits on the UK Singles Chart with \"Up on the Roof\", \"Count on Me\" (both 1963) and \"Come to Me\" (1964). She also recorded a cover version of \"Every Day I Have to Cry\" (1964).\nGrant was a contemporary of Petula Clark and Cilla Black, and Allmusic journalist, Richie Unterberger, noted \"she had a strong, versatile voice\" but was hindered by \"her inability to carve out a recognizable stylistic niche\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Downtown (Petula Clark song)", "response": ["Hatch envisioned his embryonic composition \"as a sort of doo wop R&B song\" which he thought to eventually pitch to The Drifters: He had scored his biggest success to date with The Searchers' \"Sugar and Spice\" modelled on The Drifters' hit \"Sweets for My Sweet\", and had also produced a cover version of The Drifters' \"Up on the Roof\" for Julie Grant. It has been said that Hatch gave Julie Grant the opportunity to record \"Downtown\" which Grant turned down, but this does not accord with Hatch's statement that he played \"Downtown\" for Petula Clark within a few days of conceiving the melody and only completed the song's lyrics after Clark had asked to record it. Hatch has also said that prior to Clark's expressed interest in \"Downtown\", \"it never occurred to me that a white woman could even sing it.\" Hatch has subsequently denied originally offering \"Downtown\" to the Drifters."]}, {"page": "Tony Hatch", "response": ["While at Pye, he produced many of their artists: the Searchers, David Bowie, Mark Wynter, the Settlers, the Viscounts, Julie Grant, Gary Miller, Benny Hill, the Overlanders, Roy Budd, the Brook Brothers, Jimmy Justice, the Montanas, Miki & Griff, Emile Ford, Craig Douglas, Bruce Forsyth, Sue Nicholls, the Breakaways, Norman Vaughan, Buddy Greco, Sacha Distel, Anne Shelton, Sweet Sensation, David Parton, and Graduate among others."]}, {"page": "Up on the Roof (song)", "response": ["In the UK the Drifters' version of \"Up on the Roof\" failed to reach the Top 50, being trumped by two local cover versions, sung by, respectively, Julie Grant and Kenny Lynch. The Kenny Lynch version, which largely replicated the Drifters' original, was the more successful, reaching number 10 in the UK. The Julie Grant version, which reached number 33 in the UK, reinvented the song as a Merseybeat number; its producer Tony Hatch would later be inspired to write Petula Clark's iconic hit \"Downtown\", which was originally envisioned as being in the style of the Drifters, with whom Hatch hoped to place it."]}, {"page": "Grant (surname)", "response": ["*Julie Grant (born 1946), English singer"]}, {"page": "Court TV", "response": ["Court TV currently shows gavel to gavel live news trial coverage under the branding Court TV Live.

Among his clients he counted David Bowie's first group, The Konrads, although the Konrads, unlike the Stones, \"never progressed beyond the suburban pub circuit\", says Sandford, and may not have been particularly interested in them.  Easton also ran Julie Grant\u2014whom Easton saw as a successor to Helen Shapiro\u2014and booked her to back the Stones on their first UK tour. Easton claimed to have managed the Dave Clark Five before the Stones, and organised their first American tour. His partnership with them, though, says Easton, ended because the group thought him to be concentrating too much on the Stones and not enough on them. Easton also managed Bert Weedon, Mrs Mills and the host of ITV's popular music show Thank Your Lucky Stars, Brian Matthew. Through Matthew, Easton had arranged the Stones' first TV appearance. Clayson says that Easton was \"respected and liked by his many prestigious artistes\" due to his background in the industry and the fact that he was committed to their long-term success. For example, for Weedon he had obtained a residency on the BBC's Billy Cotton Band Show, and Mills he obtained a place for on ITV's children's series, the Five O'Clock Club. According to Peter Townsend, Easton believed that the Stones' impact would be ephemeral and that it would be his other clients\u2014Grant, Weedon and Mills\u2014who would be his long-term investments. Easton, says Townsend, also had other sidelines to buffer him financially, telling Townsend, \"if this popular music business collapses, I'm not terribly worried. I've got a nice little income guaranteed; I hire out 20 organs to Butlins.\"thumb|upright=1.5|alt=scan of a magazine advert from Eric Easton Ltd|Christmas greetings from Eric Easton Ltd on behalf of a number of clients, published in Pop Weekly, 21 December 1963"]}, {"page": "When You Ask About Love", "response": ["* In 1962, Julie Grant covered the song for the B-side of \"Up on the Roof\"."]}, {"page": "History of the Jews in Leeds", "response": ["Julie Grant (born 1946) Having moved to Leeds with family, she trained in dance and opera, and sung with local orchestra and in working men\u2019s clubs in Leeds.
