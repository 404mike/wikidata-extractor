Born in New Monkland, Lanarkshire, he began his playing career with Rangers in 1904. A year later, he moved to Albion Rovers, before another transfer in 1906 to Dumbarton, where he scored three goals in nine appearances.He later moved into management, and after 11 years as manager of Airdrieonians, he became the sixth manager in the history of Manchester United on 1 November 1921 after Jack Robson stepped down due to ill health. His first season in charge finished with United bottom of the league and relegated to the Second Division; however, Chapman guided them to second place to win promotion back to the top flight three years later.\nOn 7 October 1926, The Football Association announced that Chapman had been suspended from \"taking part in football or football management\" during the 1926\u201327 season \"for improper conduct in his position as Secretary-Manager of the Manchester United Football Club\". No further explanation for the suspension was ever given. By the next match, two days later against Bolton Wanderers, Lal Hilditch had taken over on a temporary basis as player-manager.\nFollowing the end of his suspension, Chapman unsuccessfully applied to become manager of Leeds United and turned down two football management offers before taking up a position as the general manager of the Liverpool Greyhound Racing Club in August 1927.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester United F.C.", "response": ["| John Chapman"]}, {"page": "John Chapman", "response": ["John Chapman may refer to:", "*John Chapman (Leicester MP) represented Leicester (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Sir John Chapman, 2nd Baronet (c. 1710\u20131781), British Member of Parliament for Taunton, 1741\u20131747", "*John Chapman (1810\u20131877), British Member of Parliament for Grimsby, 1862\u20131865 and 1874\u20131877", "*John Chapman (congressman) (1740\u20131800), United States Representative from Pennsylvania", "*John Chapman Andrew (1822\u20131907), Member of Parliament in New Zealand", "*John Chapman (Australian politician) (1879\u20131931), Australian Senator", "*John Chapman (theologian) (1704\u20131784), English cleric and scholar", "*John Chapman (engineer) (1801\u20131854), English political and economic writer", "*John Chapman (screenwriter) (1927\u20132001), English playwright and screenwriter", "*John Chapman (baseball) (1899\u20131953), former shortstop", "*John Chapman (cricketer, born 1877) (1877\u20131956), English cricketer", "*John Chapman (cricketer, born 1814) (1814\u20131896), English cricketer", "*John Chapman (New Zealand cricketer) (1865-1949), New Zealand cricketer", "*John Chapman (football manager) (1882\u20131948), footballer and manager", "*John Chapman (rugby league), Australian rugby league player", "*John Chapman (harness racing) (1928\u20131980), Canadian driver", "*John Chapman (priest) (1865\u20131933), British priest, abbot, and religious scholar", "*John Chapman (evangelist) (1930\u20132012), Australian evangelist", "*John Chapman (bishop), Anglican bishop in Canada", "*Johnny Appleseed (John Chapman, 1774\u20131845), pioneer nurseryman and missionary", "*John Chapman (publisher) (1821\u20131894), publisher of the Westminster Review", "*John Chapman (Medal of Honor) (1844\u20131905), French soldier who fought in the American Civil War", "*John Chapman (general) (1896\u20131963), Australian Army general of WWII", "*John Chapman (artist) (born 1946), British artist", "*John Chapman (producer), British television producer"]}, {"page": "Lal Hilditch", "response": ["In October 1926, after John Chapman was suspended for unknown reasons, Hilditch took over the manager's job for the rest of the season in addition to his playing duties."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. managers", "response": ["Robson was followed soon after by John Chapman.
