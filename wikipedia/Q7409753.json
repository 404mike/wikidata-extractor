An engineer by trade and shop steward of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, Reid, along with his colleagues Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Gilmore and Sammy Barr, decided that the best way to show the viability of keeping the yards open was by staging a work-in rather than by going on strike. This meant that the workers would continue to complete what orders the shipyard had until the government changed policy."]}, {"page": "Cambuslang", "response": ["* Sammy Gilmore (1939-2011), shipyard trade-unionist; most notably a leader of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in in 1971"]}, {"page": "Upper Clyde Shipbuilders", "response": ["The work-in was led by a group of young shop stewards, including Jimmy Reid, Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Barr and Sammy Gilmore, the former three being members of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

Barr was credited with coming up with the idea for a work-in, which gained a lot of publicity and forced the UK Government into a reversal, saving 6,000 jobs at the shipyard.    Barr was a lifelong friend to fellow UCS activists Jimmy Airlie and Sammy Gilmore.  Throughout his life he displayed \"considerable political commitment\"  to the right to work, and protection for the rights of young working people, and also particularly to the protection of the Clyde shipyards.
