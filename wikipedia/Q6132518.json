He represented the North in the North v. South series. A small man, 5 ft 4in tall, he and his brother Charles played in Sheffield matches up to 1846, and one of them may have appeared in a Marsden match in 1826. Originally a filesmith living in Sheffield, he moved to Darnell in 1835, where he kept the inn and cricket ground, his wife continuing to run the ground after his death.\nIn 1838, Dearman challenged Alfred Mynn for the single wicket \"championship of England\".  They played two matches at Town Malling and Sheffield.  Both were won by Mynn.  Dearman was so small beside Mynn that they were dubbed \"David and Goliath\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North v South", "response": ["Cricket in the 18th century had been predominantly a southern game, played especially in London and the southeastern counties.
