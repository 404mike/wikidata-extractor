His work gestures towards the theatricality of minimalism and formalism. There is a focus on materiality, alchemy, and a deep respect for light and space.\"My work is my best attempt at giving the impossible, the infinite, a physical, objective existence. The materials are merely an extension of the gesture. I start with the gesture and have spent decades distilling these concepts down to the essential. So whether I\u2019m using vanguard, illustrious materials and high technology or centuries old metal techniques \u2014 my interest is in communicating the most direct way I can. There is a minimalistic simplicity to the work, yet it expresses something infinite \u2014 it\u2019s a pluralistic paradox. I\u2019ve tried to visually demonstrate the colossally vast and the infinitesimally small \u2014 the cosmos and the divinity inside oneself.\"  Aesthetica Magazine", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James (surname)", "response": ["* Anthony James (actor) (1942\u20132020), American actor", "* Anthony James (artist) (born 1974), English sculptor, painter and performance artist"]}, {"page": "Anthony James", "response": ["Anthony James may refer to:", "*Anthony James (artist) (born 1974), English sculptor, painter and performance artist", "*Anthony James (actor) (1942\u20132020), American actor", "*Anthony James (basketball)\u00a0\u2014 see 2010\u201311 Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball season", "*Anthony James (scientist)\u00a0\u2014 see List of members of the National Academy of Sciences (Animal, nutritional and applied microbial sciences)"]}, {"page": "Anthony James (Artist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anthony James (artist) "]}, {"page": "Infinity mirror", "response": ["Visual artists, especially contemporary sculptors, have made use of infinity mirrors.
