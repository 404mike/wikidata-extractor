His short term at the club was unsuccessful and only a couple of memorable results were achieved, notably a 2\u20131 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the League Cup. A reasonable start to season 2004\u201305 came to a halt when Brannigan physically confronted a player and a supporter during a match against Elgin City. Queen's lost the match 1\u20130 and Brannigan lost his job.", "Billy Stark was installed as Kenny Brannigan's replacement in August 2004 and the season ended with Queen's in 4th place. Inconsistency prevented Queen's from reaching the first ever play-offs the following season but in 2006\u201307 the Spiders were promoted. Not unlike the successful side of 1981, there were few veterans, and the team mostly consisted of young players with little or no experience of football away from Queen's Park. In August 2006, Queen's defeated SPL side Aberdeen in a League Cup penalty shoot-out to record one of their greatest ever victories. League form dramatically improved after the New Year as only one home match was lost in the second half of the season. Queen's went on a run of eight consecutive victories, during which goalkeeper David Crawford set a new club record by keeping seven successive shut-outs. Queen's finished 3rd in the league, acquiring only one less point than the side which had won the Championship 7 years earlier. Promotion was achieved via the play-offs. Queen's defeated Arbroath in the semi-finals 4\u20131 on aggregate and then East Fife in the final 7\u20132 on aggregate. Richard Sinclair and Frankie Carroll became the first players in the club's history to win promotion on more than one occasion. Queen's Park's cavalier playing style was one which was lauded by coaches from opposition sides during the season and they were acknowledged as being well worthy of their promotion."]}, {"page": "Gordon Chisholm", "response": ["Chisholm again became Ian McCall's assistant, this time at Dumfries club Queen of the South, until McCall's departure from the club at the end of the 2006\u201307 season.

In March 2008, Chisholm guided Queens to only their second ever Scottish Cup semi-final appearance with a 2\u20130 quarter final victory against Dundee, a game notable for a goal from 84 yards by Ryan McCann. Queens followed this with a 4\u20133 win against Aberdeen in the semi-final, which meant that Chisholm had guided Queens to their first ever Scottish Cup Final appearance.
