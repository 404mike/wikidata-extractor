It is mentioned in a publication called \"The Musical Magazine\" in 1835. The legend began three-quarters of a century after Handel's death with Richard Clark in his Reminiscences of Handel (1836). Henry Wylde and Richard Clark then found an old anvil in a smithy near Whitchurch, Edgware, and fabricated a story to identify William Powell as the fictitious blacksmith, when, in fact, he had been the parish clerk. They raised a subscription for a wooden memorial to him, and in 1868, the people of Whitchurch subscribed again for a grandiloquent gravestone, still standing. It reads: \"In memory of William Powell, the Harmonious Blacksmith, who was buried 27. of February 1780, aged 78 years. He was Parish Clerk during the time the immortal Handel was organist of this church. Erected by subscription, May 1868.\""]}, {"page": "J. E.

Emma was the third daughter of Richard Clark, the well known Musical Antiquary b. 1780 in Datchet. In 1832, they would have their first child, a girl named Emma, but she would die during a particularly bad cholera outbreak in 1832. Just a few weeks later, Goodson and Emma fled the cholera epidemic and settled in York, Upper Canada. Goodson's mother, father, and brother all died in the London cholera epidemics. Upon arriving in York, Goodson was immediately faced with another cholera epidemic, one which would take the life of his wife, Emma (recent research has shown an Emma Goodson living at St George the Martyr, Southwark, London, in the 1841 Census her occupation being  'Musical Professor'. She is living here with her brother in law, James Adcock, and her elder sister Sophia Louise Adcock- n\u00e9e Clark).Class: HO107; Piece: 1086; Book: 2; Civil Parish: St George The Martyr; County: Surrey; Enumeration District: 4; Folio: 30; Page: 13; Line: 8; GSU roll: 474669 Historical documents estimate that this particular epidemic killed approximately 1,000 people. Given the population of York at the time, all families must have been affected. A grief-stricken Goodson agreed to perform at the first public bazaar in York on December 27, 1833. The bazaar was organized in order to obtain relief funds for the families of those killed by the cholera epidemic. His performance, the singing of a song entitled \"Raven Plume\", was a song specifically written for the bazaar. The song, a romance from a Welsh legendary tale, was composed by I. W. Cawdell, who later was librarian and secretary to The Law Society of Upper Canada at Osgoode Hall.Toronto, 46"]}, {"page": "Thomas Ludford Bellamy", "response": ["Bellamy published a song book in 1840, in the tradition of Richard Clark."]}]}}
