Although he is brave and his spear thrust more than adequate, he cannot raise his arm so he cannot be part of the phalanx, a vital part of the Spartan battle formation. Leonidas asks him to support his brethren by bringing the wounded water and clearing the dead from the battleground. In anger, Ephialtes swears to prove his parents and Leonidas wrong as he betrays them by revealing to Xerxes a hidden route that the Persian army could use to outflank the Greek defenders. When only a handful of Spartans are left when the Persians descend, Ephialtes, in Persian uniform, is with them. Leonidas gives him a blessing to live forever, which functions as an insult since a Spartan's greatest honor is to die in battle."]}, {"page": "2002 in film", "response": ["| The Pianist || Focus Features || Roman Polanski (director); Ronald Harwood (screenplay); Adrien Brody, Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner, Jessica Kate Meyer, Ronan Vibert, Ruth Platt, Andrew Tiernan, Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski, Roy Smiles, Richard Ridings, Daniel Caltagirone, Valentine Pelka, Zbigniew Zamachowski || Drama || Live Action"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| Snow White: A Tale of Terror || PolyGram Filmed Entertainment / Interscope Communications || Michael Cohn (director); Tom Szollosi, Deborah Serra (screenplay); Sigourney Weaver, Sam Neill, Monica Keena, Gil Bellows, David Conrad, Miroslav Taborsky, Brian Glover, Andrew Tiernan, Anthony Brophy, Chris Bauer, Frances Cuka, Bryan Pringle, Taryn Davis, Joanna Roth, John Edward Allen, Dale Wyatt || Gothic, Fantasy, Horror || Live action", "| Playing God || Touchstone Pictures / Beacon Pictures || Andy Wilson (director); Mark Haskell Smith (screenplay); David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton, Angelina Jolie, Michael Massee, Peter Stormare, Andrew Tiernan, Gary Dourdan, John Hawkes, Philip Moon, Pavel D.
