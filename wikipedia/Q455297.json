Marray is a former top 20 doubles player, reaching a career high of world no. 15 in January 2013, mainly due to more regular appearances on the ATP World Tour, following his victory at Wimbledon 2012. He has also competed on the singles tour, reaching world no. 215 in April 2005, but was unable to continue his singles career, in part due to injuries.Marray first came to prominence at the 2004 Queen's Club Championship where he reached the third round. Marray has since played predominantly on the ATP Challenger Tour, where he has reached one singles final and won multiple doubles competitions.\nIn 2012 at Wimbledon, he and his doubles partner, Frederik Nielsen, on a wildcard entry into the tournament, won the final in five sets, beating the much favoured fifth seeds, Robert Lindstedt and Horia Tec\u0103u. Marray was the first British men's doubles champion since Raymond Tuckey and Pat Hughes in 1936, the same year that Fred Perry last won the Wimbledon singles title. Marray and Nielsen also became the first players to win the men's doubles event on a wildcard.\nMarray made his Davis Cup debut at 32, playing with Colin Fleming in the 2013 tie against Russia. Great Britain came from 2\u20130 down to beat Russia 3\u20132 to earn a World Group play-off. The last time Great Britain had come from 2\u20130 down to win a tie was 83 years previously against Germany. Marray was named for the 2013 World Group play-off against Croatia and so helped Great Britain earn promotion to the World Group for the first time since 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Wimbledon Open Era champions", "response": [" |  Jonathan Marray Frederik Nielsen"]}, {"page": "Mahesh Bhupathi", "response": ["On 4 November 2012, Bhupathi and partner Rohan Bopanna won the Paris Masters cup.
