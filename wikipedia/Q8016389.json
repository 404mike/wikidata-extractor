In an October 1796 letter to the British Home Secretary William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, he wrote that \"His Majesty's English subjects here compared to the [French-Canadians] are not in a greater proportion as Seventy to Two Thousand.\" This thinking was encouraged by leading Anglo-Canadian elites such as Chief Justice William Osgoode and Attorney General Jonathan Sewell, who promoted the idea that the unrest was a Franco-American plot to overthrow British rule in Canada. Prescott cracked down against perceived insurrectionists, leading to the trial and execution of the Quebec City merchant David McLane, who was an American citizen. Going further, he banned the immigration of Catholic priests from France, and engaged in strict surveillance of the Roman Catholic Church, also arguing that the government should take over the estates held by the Sulpician order. However, his reluctance to directly violate the rights of Catholics led to conflict with the Anglican Bishop of Quebec, Jacob Mountain, who singlemindedly pursued Anglican supremacy over the Catholic Church.", "Prescott was also faced with a refugee crisis, as many United Empire Loyalists and others who had desired to leave the newly-founded United States and settle in Canada had still not received legal title to any lands, and had either returned to the United States or began squatting on land for such a considerable duration of time as to engage in cultivation and land improvements. With responsibility for addressing the crisis falling to him as governor, Prescott devised a scheme designed to distinguish genuine settlers from land speculators by basing the size of township grants on the expenses incurred by the applicant, which also served to reward those who had begun to develop lands in anticipation of receiving a land title. This satisfied the majority of applicants, but angered speculators, as it limited their ability to profit from merely holding title to lands in Canada. Prescott began to suspect a conspiracy dating back to at least 1794 amongst members of the Executive Council, including William Osgoode, Hugh Finlay (chairman of the land committee), and John Young, to exploit their official positions to acquire large tracts of land for themselves. The Executive Council condemned Prescott's attempted solution to the land issue, leading him to believe that his suspicions had been confirmed. A military figure who was unaccustomed to politicking and perceived insubordination, Prescott lashed out against councillors, openly accusing them of land speculation and jobbery. In April 1799, attempts at reconciliation failed, and the British government recalled Prescott to England, despatching Sir Robert Milnes, 1st Baronet as lieutenant governor to manage Lower Canada in his absence. Milnes promptly permitted the Executive Council the land grants they had pursued."]}, {"page": "Court of Appeal for Ontario", "response": ["| 1 || William Osgoode|| 1792\u20131794"]}, {"page": "Osgoode Hall", "response": ["Osgoode Hall is a landmark building in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
