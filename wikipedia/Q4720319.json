He inherited the company in 1857 and expanded its business, exporting whisky throughout the British Empire.\nIn 1867 he registered Old Highland Whisky, one of the earliest brands to be trademarked.  From that time it has had the now famous slanted black and gold label. In the late 1870s he switched to the distinctive square bottle design.\nUpon his death in 1889, he left the business to his sons George Paterson Walker and Alexander Walker II.\nGeorge ran marketing and distribution through the London office.
