To test the idea, Smith and Severin recorded a reworking of The Cure's \"Siamese Twins\", with Lol Tolhurst on drums, and Anne Stephenson and Virginia Hewes (later known as Ginni Ball) of the Venomettes on violins, which was performed on BBC Two's music programme Riverside in March 1983, featuring two dancers choreographed by Dixon.

As he neared the age of 30, vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the band's pop successes with a more enduring work. This, coupled with a distaste for the group's newfound popularity, caused Smith to lapse back into the use of hallucinogenic drugs, the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album. The band recorded the album at Hookend Recording Studios in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, with co-producer David M. Allen from late 1988 to early 1989. Following the completion of the mixing, founding member Lol Tolhurst was fired from the band.", "The Cure's second album Seventeen Seconds (1980) established it as a prominent gothic rock band, which would be followed up by Faith (1981), and Pornography (1982). Three singles were released during 1982 and 1983 that were a significant divergence in style; essentially, pop hits. \"The Love Cats\" became the band's first single to infiltrate the top ten in the United Kingdom, peaking at number seven. This shift is attributed to Smith's frustration over the band's labelling as a predictable gothic rock band: \"My reaction to all those people\u00a0... was to make a demented and calculated song like 'Let's Go to Bed'.\" Following the return of guitarist Porl Thompson and bassist Simon Gallup and the addition of drummer Boris Williams in 1984, Smith and keyboardist Lol Tolhurst continued to integrate more pop-oriented themes with the release of the group's sixth studio album The Head on the Door (1985).
