The mediaeval suburb of Potterrow, which lay outside the town walls and had been rebuilt in the Victorian period, was obliterated in the process. By the late 1960s, such developments perceived by many as unsympathetic to the historical character of the city, together with the further remodelling of sections of Princes Street, prompted the eminent historian Christopher Smout to urge its citizens \"to save the New Town from the vandalism of neglect and development carried on today with the consent of the present council, whose crocodile tears and pretty exhibitions do nothing at all to stop the builders' rape of the capital\"."]}, {"page": "1994 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Professor Thomas Christopher Smout, Deputy Chairman, Scottish Natural Heritage and Member, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.
