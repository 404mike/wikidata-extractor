A slow left-arm orthodox bowler, Cranfield took 621 wickets in first-class cricket, and took 100 or more wickets in a season in three successive years at his peak.Cranfield first played for Somerset in 1897, and took five wickets on his debut. Somerset hoped that he would be able to replace Ted Tyler, whose career was effectively ended in 1900 when he was repeatedly no-balled for throwing. At his prime, Cranfield was capable of bowling with significant curve, sufficient to allow him to place almost all of his fielders on the leg side. However, he lacked consistency, particularly regarding the length of his bowling.In 1901, 1902 and 1903, Cranfield took 100 or more wickets in first-class cricket, peaking in the middle year, when he claimed 141, at an average of 18.56. He was invited to play for representative sides twice, appearing for the Players against the Gentlemen at Scarborough in 1902, and then for the \"Players of the South\" against the Gentlemen in 1904. Despite his professional status, Cranfield also appeared for the \"Gentlemen of England\" in 1903 against Oxford University, taking seven wickets in the match. His best bowling performance came the following year, when he claimed eight wickets for 39 runs against Gloucestershire. In all, he took five wickets in an innings 47 times, and on twelve occasions he claimed 10 wickets in a match. Cranfield's batting was lowly regarded, and club historian Eddie Lawrence describes him as \"an obvious number eleven in the batting order\".Cranfield was rarely a healthy man, and in January 1909, he caught a chill while watching a football match. Four days later, he died of pneumonia. His brother, Lionel Cranfield, and his nephew (Lionel's son) Monty Cranfield both also played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["The subsequent 1901 season was, statistically, his best. He trailed only Fry and Ranjitsinhji in the national batting averages, and drew particular acclaim for his innings of 173 against Yorkshire. The all-conquering Yorkshire were reigning County Champions, unbeaten in 1900; the match against Somerset at Headingley was the only one they lost in 1901. Somerset were dismissed for 87 in their first innings, and Yorkshire reached 325 to lead by 238 runs on first innings. Palairet and his fellow opener Len Braund\u2014both of whom had been out without scoring in the first innings\u2014then scored 222 runs together in 140 minutes at the start of Somerset's second innings, each scoring a century. After the dismissal of Braund for 107, Palairet continued, eventually being caught and bowled for 173. Frank Phillips added a third century (122), and Somerset reached a total of 630. Yorkshire were bowled out on a wearing pitch for 113, with Braund and Beaumont Cranfield each taking four wickets, and Somerset won by 279 runs.Green (1980), pp. 277\u2013278. The Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, declared that it was \"one of the best matches I ever lost.\" In the same year, Palairet scored 182 against Lancashire and 194 against Sussex. Altogether he scored five centuries and eleven half-centuries in 1901, averaging 57.75 for his 1,906 runs\u2014the highest season's total of his career."]}, {"page": "1902 English cricket season", "response": [" || Beaumont Cranfield || Somerset || 18 || 4131 || 115 || 17.15"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Beaumont Cranfield (1897\u20131908) 125 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Lionel Cranfield (cricketer)", "response": ["His brother, Beaumont Cranfield, played for Somerset between 1897 and 1908 and Lionel's son, Monty Cranfield, played for Gloucestershire from 1934 to 1951."]}, {"page": "Monty Cranfield", "response": ["Monty Cranfield was the son of Lionel Cranfield, who played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire and Somerset between 1903 and 1922, and the nephew of Beaumont Cranfield, who played for Somerset from 1897 to 1908 and who died just months before Monty was born."]}, {"page": "Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1871)", "response": ["In the 1902 season, Lee reappeared in first-class cricket as a lower order batsman for Somerset. He played seven matches in 1902 without great success, but in 1903 and 1904 he was a regular member of the team. He made little impact in 1903 until, coming in at No 9 with Somerset at 142 for seven wickets against a Gloucestershire total of 172, he made an unbeaten 73 and took the side through to a match-winning lead. A week later, Lee played a second innings of 73 and this time the match was more sensational. Somerset had trailed Lancashire by 68 runs on the first innings in the match at Old Trafford, but batted steadily in the second innings. Lee came in at 211 for six wickets and his 73, the top score of the innings, helped Somerset to a total of 361, after which Len Braund and Beaumont Cranfield bowled Lancashire out for 111 to complete a Somerset victory by 182 runs. Lee's lower order success saw him moved up the Somerset batting order and in August in the match against Middlesex at Taunton he made 83 in a high-scoring match, and this proved to be the highest score of his first-class career. In the 1903 season, Lee made 627 runs at an average of 23.22."]}, {"page": "Oswald Samson", "response": ["In-between his university appearances, Samson had hit the only century of his first-class cricket career for Somerset in the match against Gloucestershire at Gloucester; the century, 105, came after Gloucestershire had been dismissed for just 61, and Beaumont Cranfield and Len Braund bowled unchanged through the two Gloucestershire innings. He played fairly regularly for Somerset in the rest of the 1903 season, but did not reach 50 in any other innings."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Beaumont Cranfield", "|align=left|Beaumont Cranfield", "|align=left|Beaumont Cranfield", "|align=left|Beaumont Cranfield"]}, {"page": "1902 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 115 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 17.15 || Beaumont Cranfield || Somerset"]}, {"page": "List of London County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Beaumont Cranfield : B.
