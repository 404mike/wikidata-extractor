The exact price was not made public, but according to Beaumont, \"he wasn't dear (expensive) at all\". Beaumont trained the horse at his Foulrice Farm stable at Brandsby near York. Beaumont had originally established himself as a trainer on the amateur point-to-point circuit and at the time of Jodami's greatest success his stable housed approximately twenty horses.

The Aintree race was the last time that Jodami would finish a race in lower than third place for five years.
