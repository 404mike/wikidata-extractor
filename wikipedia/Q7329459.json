He played professionally for Newport County and Torquay United and has been manager of Yate Town and Almondsbury Town. He is currently manager of Mangotsfield United.\nThompson was on schoolboy forms with Watford and played for Yate Town before joining Newport County in January 1987. He scored on his Newport debut in October 1987, but was transfer-listed shortly afterwards due to Newport's growing financial crisis.\nNewport were relegated at the end of the season, and would fold before the end of their first season in the Conference. Thompson left to join Torquay United in June 1988 and made his Torquay debut in the first game of the following season, playing as a substitute for Jim McNichol in the 2\u20130 defeat at home to Halifax Town. His next appearance came on 25 October 2007, starting in the goalless draw away to Darlington. He started the next four games before losing his place again and appeared only sporadically thereafter. He joined Yeovil Town on loan and moved to Yeovil in August 1989 after being released by Torquay.\nThompson subsequently played for Trowbridge Town, Salisbury City, Yate Town, Forest Green Rovers, Mangotsfield United, Taunton Town and Tiverton Town before returning to Taunton Town with whom he won an FA Vase winners' medal.\nIn July 2000, Thompson was appointed as manager of Yate Town and has since led the side to two promotions. In May 2007 he was linked with the vacant manager's post at Mangotsfield United, but remained with Yate Town.\nThompson left Yate in 2009 and was next manager at Almondsbury Town. He left Almondsbury however when the club were forced to resign from the Southern League.\nIn April 2012, Thompson was appointed manager at Mangotsfield United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trowbridge Town F.C.", "response": ["*Richard Thompson"]}, {"page": "Richard Thompson", "response": ["Richard Thompson may refer to:", "* Richard Thompson (animator) (1914\u20131998), Warner Bros. cartoon animator in the 1950s", "* Richard Thompson (cartoonist) (1957\u20132016), cartoonist who also worked as an illustrator", "* Richard Thompson (musician) (born 1949), songwriter and musician", "* Sir Richard Thompson, 1st Baronet (1912\u20131999), British Conservative politician", "* Richard Thompson (Australian politician) (1832\u20131906), New South Wales politician", "* Richard Thompson (MP for Reading) (died c. 1735), British Whig politician", "* Richard Thompson (Maine politician) (born 1947), attorney and Democratic member of the Maine House of Representatives", "* Richard Thompson (priest) (1648\u20131685), Dean of Bristol", "* Richard Thompson (footballer, born 1969), English football player", "* Richard Thompson (footballer, born 1974), English football player", "* Richard Thompson (sprinter) (born 1985), Trinidad and Tobago sprinter", "* Richard Thompson (marine biologist), director of the Marine Institute at the University of Plymouth, coined the term \"microplastics\"", "* Richard Thompson (physician) (born 1940), president of the Royal College of Physicians and formerly physician to the Queen", "* Richard Thompson (businessman) (born 1964), British entrepreneur and chairman of Surrey County Cricket Club", "* Richard Thompson (Royal Navy officer) (born 1966), British admiral", "* Richard Thompson, former prosecutor and current president of Thomas More Law Center", "* Richard Thompson, mathematician for whom the infinite Thompson groups are named"]}]}}
