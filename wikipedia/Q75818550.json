Of the casualties whose residence was recorded, sixty-one per cent lived within a three-mile radius of the centre of Manchester. Some groups carried banners with texts like \"No Corn Laws\", \"Annual Parliaments\", \"Universal suffrage\" and \"Vote By Ballot\". The first female reform societies were established in the textile areas in 1819 and women from the Manchester Female Reform Society, dressed in white, accompanied Hunt to the platform. The society's president Mary Fildes rode in Hunt's carriage carrying its flag. The only banner known to have survived is in Middleton Public Library; it was carried by Thomas Redford, who was injured by a yeomanry sabre. Made of green silk embossed with gold lettering, one side of the banner is inscribed \"Liberty and Fraternity\" and the other \"Unity and Strength.\" It is the world's oldest political banner."]}, {"page": "William Hay", "response": ["* William Robert Hay (1761\u20131839), British barrister, cleric and magistrate"]}, {"page": "John Astley (painter)", "response": ["*Mary Wagstaffe (1760/1 \u2013 18 February 1832), \"a celebrated young beauty\" and a daughter of William Wagstaffe, a wealthy surgeon of Manchester.

Joshua, son Robert, daughter Mary, and daughter-in-law Esther all earn a living by manual labour in a cotton mill. An economic depression makes work impossible for the traumatised Joseph to find and threatens the family's livelihood. The family is sympathetic to the radical campaigns for equal civil and political rights for all free men and against the Corn Laws that prevent them from buying cheaper imported grain. Joshua, Joseph, and Robert attend political meetings where local agitators including John Knight, Samuel Bamford and John Bagguley speak out against the system of government; Nellie attends a meeting of the Manchester Female Reform Society. The local authorities, led by magistrates Colonel Fletcher, Reverend William Robert Hay, Reverend Charles Ethelston and Mr. Norris and Deputy Chief Constable Nadin, spy on the radical movement and wait for an excuse to arrest its leaders. The Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, is determined to suppress radical politics. When a disgruntled Londoner smashes the window of the Prince Regent's coach, Sidmouth uses this as a pretext for suspending habeas corpus."]}, {"page": "Charles Ethelston", "response": ["Clerical magistrates were common in England in the later 18th century and early 19th century. Their numbers dropped back after 1832 and the Great Reform Act: in 1740 they were uncommon. In Lancashire the custom was to exclude manufacturers from the bench, to keep it impartial in trade disputes: the practical result was that it was dominated by landowners and clerics, and by High Church and High Tory views. In Manchester at this period the prominent magistrates, according to Marlow, were the lawyer James Norris, and two clerics, Ethelston and William Robert Hay.", "Ethelston defended William Robert Hay in the Manchester Gazette on 25 September 1819, complaining of the ad hominem attacks made on all those who opposed reformers. William Benbow in his Rambler's Magazine in 1822 listed \"Hay and Ethelstone\" with disreputable clerics as \"chief agitators\" in Manchester. Satire against clerical magistrates picked on Ethelston. According to Gibson, \"It took many years for the people to forget that the magistrates who read the Riot Act at the Peterloo d\u00e9b\u00e2cle were Anglican clergy.\""]}, {"page": "John Molesworth (priest)", "response": ["A few months later (3 March 1840), Howley presented Molesworth to Rochdale. He succeeded the absentee vicar William Robert Hay. Dissenters, led John Bright, were campaigning for the abolition of church rates. Eventually Molesworth had to concede that the issue was a lost cause. He bore down on the church's leaseholders of its property, who had not to built on the land in line with their covenants, and was then able to promote church building by matching new funds with those of parishioners, Four churches so endowed were added to the existing 14.
