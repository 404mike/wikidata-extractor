He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1914 to 1919, then returned to teaching. He became a prolific British writer. Born Stephen Henry Critten, he used a number of pseudonyms, eventually changing his name to one of them, Stephen Southwold. He most often wrote as Neil Bell and also wrote as Miles, Stephen Green, S. H. Lambert, and Paul Martens.\nHe was born in Southwold, Suffolk. His change of name was apparently a reaction against his father. Initially writing a number of science fiction books, he later concentrated on conventional novels. He also wrote a large number of short stories, many of them under the Southwold name being for children. Bell also wrote several science fiction novels, including The Seventh Bowl (about immortality), The Gas War Of 1940 (about a future war), and the end of the world story The Lord of Life. Who Walk in Fear is a collection of horror stories.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Stephen Southwold (1887\u20131964) \u2013 Fiddlededee: A Medley of Stories"]}, {"page": "Southwold", "response": ["*Stephen Southwold (pseudonym, 1887\u20131964), schoolmaster and prolific writer"]}, {"page": "Neil Bell", "response": ["*Neil Bell, pseudonym of Stephen Southwold (1887\u20131964), British writer"]}, {"page": "Stephen Henry Critten", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stephen Southwold"]}, {"page": "S.
