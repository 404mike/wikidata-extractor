He died in April 2018 and, after having his brain donated and examined by the neuropathologist Dr Willie Stewart in a similar way as Jeff Astle, it was proved that he was suffering from Dementia with Lewy bodies and CTE.  His daughter was made a Trustee of the Jeff Astle Foundation as well as working alongside The Professional Footballers Association union on an initial six-month advisory basis, to help shape the neurodegenerative care provision for former members and their families."]}]}}
