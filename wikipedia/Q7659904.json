At the end of this run Sydney Dickinson was brought in from Bradford Park Avenue, though the Vale then went on to lose five of their next six matches, conceding sixteen goals and scoring just three. The slide was halted with a 1\u20130 Boxing day victory over Lincoln City in which top-scorer Tom Nolan became one of only two Vale players sent off in the period between 1918 and 1947.

Gate receipts had risen slowly to \u00a311,868, though a rare transfer deficit was made, and expenses had risen sharply. The club announced that it would consider offers for any of its players, blaming the fans for a lack of enthusiasm, exemplified by an attendance of 2,990 (raising just \u00a3136) for the end-of-season clash with Nottingham Forest, despite having recently built a stand with cover for 15,000 spectators. The upshot of this was the release of a massive fifteen players, a list which included: Bill Cope, Sydney Dickinson, Len Armitage, and Jimmy McGrath. Billy Tabram was also sold to Hull City for a large fee, whilst Fred Mills' transfer to Leeds United and George Poyser's move to Brentford also brought in some much needed cash.
