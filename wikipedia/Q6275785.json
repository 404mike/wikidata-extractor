The song was \"ballady and slow\" which \"didn't fit her artist profile at the time\". Henderson \"had a lot of other releases planned and it wasn't really right for her\". She sent the song to Nathan Dawe, who \"sped it up, pitched the vocal up and completely transformed it\". Henderson \"thought it was sick and wished [Dawe] luck with it\". Dawe and his management felt that \"Lighter\" should feature a verse from a British rapper, similar to his previous single \"Flowers\" (2019), which features British rapper Jaykae, leading to the decision to feature KSI on \"Lighter\". Dawe explained, \"I've known of KSI for a long time and I've been quite a fan of his work... His music recently that's started to come out, the quality [of it has] been really good... I was listening to [his album] thinking, 'KSI's actually sick!' So I [asked] my manager, \"What do you think? Would [KSI] work?' [My manager said], 'Let's reach out [to him].'\" They sent the track to KSI, who listened to it and \"thought it was an absolute banger\" and agreed to \"jump on it\". KSI recalled, \"When I heard [the song], I thought, 'This is a smash!' I knew instantly what I needed to do to elevate it to another level.\" KSI wrote a verse for \"Lighter\" at his home in London. He recalled that \"it took [him] a couple of hours to write the verse\". He recorded the verse at an arranged recording studio session which \"took less than an hour\".
