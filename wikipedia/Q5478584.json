She was considered one of the most beautiful women of her time, and was a political hostess with a sharp wit. \nIn  late 1783, when William Pitt the younger took office, she  famously remarked that he \"could do what he pleased during the holidays, but it would only be a mince-pie administration\" (in other words it would barely last past Christmas; as it turned out she was wrong in her prediction,  but virtually everyone in the political world agreed with her).\n\nIn 1766, Frances married John Crewe, who became Baron Crewe. They  had  four children, of  whom two reached adulthood,  John Crewe,  2nd  Baron  Crewe, and Emma Crewe, who married Foster Cunliffe-Offley.  The  younger John  as  an adult became  completely  estranged \nfrom his  family. She was accustomed to entertain, at Crewe Hall, her husband's seat in Cheshire, and at her villa at Hampstead, some of the most distinguished of her contemporaries. Fox, who much admired her, Burke, Sheridan, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Canning were frequent visitors. She was also on friendly terms with Charles Burney and Sarah Burney and Hester Thrale.\nIn May 1784 when Charles James  Fox, after an epic battle, was finally confirmed as MP for Westminster, Frances Crewe hosted a party to celebrate, where all the guests were asked to wear Fox's chosen colours,  blue and buff. The Prince of Wales gave a toast True blue and Mrs. Crewe. She famously replied True blue and all of you.\nSheridan dedicated the School for Scandal to her, and some lines addressed to her by Fox were printed at the Strawberry Hill Press in 1775. Three portraits by Reynolds have been engraved, in one of which she appears with her brother as Hebe and Cupid. She died on 23 December 1818.", "link_mentions": {}}}
