Mabel was also usually not considered to be a house servant who could attend activities, such as church, prayers, and Mrs Lipton's wedding. Once Mabel stated that she believed she was looked down upon by the other servants because she was a \"casual worker\" and not a member of the live-in staff. Once Lord Meldrum decided to take the servants on a staff picnic and Mabel wondered if she could join in. James and Mrs Lipton stated Mabel was taking liberties and insinuated she was rubbish. Ivy was incensed by this and openly berated Mrs Lipton for the poor treatment of Mabel, which led to her being able to go. On another occasion, Mabel was invited by Alf to come to a servants' ball, just so she could go. When Mrs Lipton went on strike, Alf took the opportunity to treat Mabel by serving her thick slices of roast ham. When Lord Meldrum invites his workers for dinner and orders fish and chips to put them at ease, Mrs. Lipton's disdain for the aroma of the leftovers makes her only too glad to let Mabel take them home.  Following the Meldrum's financial troubles Mabel effectively becomes a maid-of-all-work, with a talent for making lumpy custard."]}, {"page": "No Peace for the Wicked", "response": ["| Barbara New"]}, {"page": "Pride and Prejudice (1958 TV series)", "response": ["Pride and Prejudice is a 1958 British television adaptation of the Jane Austen's 1813 novel of the same name, which aired on the BBC.
