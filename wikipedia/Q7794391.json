Kenlis was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered Parliament for Westmorland in 1871 (succeeding his father), a seat he held until 1885, when the constituency was abolished, and then represented Kendal until 1892.  In 1884 he wrote to the Manchester-based Women's Suffrage Journal in support of the principle of women's suffrage, stating, \"I think that (with certain limitations) women ought to be owners of the franchise.  In fact, I think many women, especially freeholders and those who own a certain amount of property, are much more entitled to it than many men whom it is intended to enfranchise by the present Bill [passed into law as the Representation of the People Act 1884].\"Lord Bective married Lady Alice Maria, daughter of Arthur Hill, 4th Marquess of Downshire, in 1867. They had two daughters:\n\nLady Olivia Caroline Amelia Taylour (22 January 1869 \u2013 26 November 1939), married Lord Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, half-brother of the 6th Duke of Portland, without issue\nLady Evelyn Alice Estelle Taylour (10 February 1873 \u2013 16 September 1875)Bective served as High Sheriff of Westmorland in 1868.
