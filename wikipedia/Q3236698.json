It is the third and final sequel to that company's The Mummy's Hand of 1940. The film is the sequel to The Mummy's Ghost (1944). The film is the fifth entry in Universal Pictures' original Mummy franchise. It marks Lon Chaney, Jr.'s final appearance as Kharis, the Egyptian mummy. The action of this film, which continues the story of Kharis and his beloved Princess Ananka, is supposed to take place in the same swampy location that was the setting of The Mummy's Ghost. But while the earlier movie was explicitly set in rural Massachusetts, this film strongly implies that the swamp is in Louisiana, with references to Cajuns and bayous. Furthermore, if one follows the continuity of the \"Kharis\" series, this film would have to take place in the late 1990s.
