However, the unlikelihood that the reputable historian Bede invented Ninian without some basis in the historical record, combined with an increased knowledge of Ireland's early saints and Whithorn's early Christian connections, has led to serious scholarly efforts to find Bede's basis. James Henthorn Todd, in his 1855 publication of the Leabhar Imuinn (The Book of Hymns of the Ancient Church of Ireland), suggested that it was Finnian of Moville, and that view has gained traction among modern scholars."]}, {"page": "Rapture", "response": ["Although not using the term \"rapture\", the idea was more fully developed by Edward Irving (1792\u20131834). In 1825, Irving directed his attention to the study of prophecy and eventually accepted the one-man Antichrist idea of James Henthorn Todd, Samuel Roffey Maitland, Robert Bellarmine, and Francisco Ribera, yet he went a step further. Irving began to teach the idea of a two-phase return of Christ, the first phase being a secret rapture prior to the rise of the Antichrist. Edward Miller described Irving's teaching like this: \"There are three gatherings:\u00a0\u2013 First, of the first-fruits of the harvest, the wise virgins who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth; next, the abundant harvest gathered afterwards by God; and lastly, the assembling of the wicked for punishment.\""]}, {"page": "St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin", "response": ["*James Henthorn Todd (1805-1869), Historian, Treasurer, Precentor "]}, {"page": "Oxford Movement", "response": ["*James Henthorn Todd"]}, {"page": "List of Trinity College Dublin people", "response": ["*James Henthorn Todd, Regis Professor, co-founder of Irish Archaeological Society, president of Royal Irish Academy", "*James Henthorn Todd, biblical scholar, educator, and Irish historian: Regius Professor of Hebrew"]}, {"page": "Domnall Ua Lochlainn", "response": ["Domnall was the son of a certain Ardgar son of Lochlann.
