In addition, Last Night on Earth is influenced by several different sources, including Tom Waits's 1992 album Bone Machine, the poetry of Frank O'Hara, the art of Edward Hopper, and the work of John Cale, Arthur Russell and Lou Reed. Reed's Berlin (1973) was particularly influential on Fink's desire to step outside his comfort zone, lyrically. \"Once you've opened up the third-person narrative it means you have to rely less on your own life and it's more fantasy and fiction,\" said Fink, whose songwriting expanded to a \"strikingly visual style,\" inspired by cinema. The process, Fink felt, exerted a tangible influence on the way he approached lyrics on Last Night on Earth. The album, in contrast to the band's prior two efforts, is a move away from autobiography, and tells short stories in song. For example, \"Wild Thing\" began as a 10-minute, richly detailed epic in the style of Street Hassle, before Fink boiled it down to its five-minute essence. The track, another instance of Fink's cinema-inspired songwriting, was designed to have a \"Twin Peaks feel.\"", "*All songs by Charlie Fink", "*Charlie Fink - vocals, guitar, art direction, design, production"]}, {"page": "Tonight's the Kind of Night", "response": ["*Producers\u00a0\u2013 Charlie Fink, Jason Lader", "*Lyrics\u00a0\u2013  Charlie Fink"]}, {"page": "Life Is Life (song)", "response": ["*Producers\u00a0\u2013 Charlie Fink, Jason Lader", "*Lyrics\u00a0\u2013  Charlie Fink"]}, {"page": "Noah and the Whale discography", "response": ["From January 2009 onwards, the band started work on their second full-length LP, entitled The First Days of Spring.
