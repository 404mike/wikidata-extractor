Over the years, several prominent critics have championed the film, including Tim Lucas, J. Hoberman, Danny Peary, Robin Wood and Derek Malcolm; their praise has particularly targeted its direction, performances, and musical score by Paul Ferris. In 2005, the magazine Total Film named Witchfinder General the 15th-greatest horror film of all time.", "Witchfinder General's celebrated score was composed by Reeves' friend Paul Ferris, who had previously scored The Sorcerers, and acted in the film under the alias \"Morris Jar\" (a reference to his favourite composer, Maurice Jarre). He drew inspiration from the folk song \"Greensleeves\" in writing the romantic theme \"Peaceful Interlude\" as a means of evoking its time period, as well as to serve as a counterpoint to the film's violence. Film critic Tim Lucas has compared the score to that of Marcello Giombini's music for the swashbuckler film Knives of the Avenger (1966), noting that both films are \"historical melodrama[s] that [function as] metaphorical Westerns\".", "Very soon after its initial release in the spring of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the UK and US. Robin Wood wrote that \"Witchfinder General is certainly [Reeves'] most successfully achieved work \u2026 what one is immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of what is on the screen\u2026  the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully. With it is associated Paul Ferris' theme-music, which suggests a traditional air without being actual quotation. Against the peace and fertility of nature is set the depravity of men.\""]}, {"page": "1995 in British music", "response": ["**Paul Ferris, film composer, 54 (suicide)Halligan, Benjamin.
