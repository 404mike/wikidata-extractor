Anderson encouraged the two to learn the other's choreography for the fight to help them anticipate the movements and avoid an accident.

The characters of Frankenstein's monster and Dracula were closely modelled on their appearances in the 1931 films Frankenstein and Dracula, respectively; the script referred to Frankenstein's monster being dressed in \"the traditional Karloff costume\", referring to Boris Karloff who portrayed the monster in the film. Playing Dracula, Malcolm Rogers pre-recorded his speech and mimed on set; Rogers intentionally moved in a stiff manner to emphasise that the character was a robotic exhibit. In the script, the Fungoids were described as \"a black, glistening creature of sponge ... shaped like an egg\"; Lambert asked Nation to change the shape so a human actor could fit inside.
