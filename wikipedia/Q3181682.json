It would also prove good training for his later nude appearances in David Grant's sex films and nudity ridden horror titles like Tower of Evil (1972), in which Hamill's role is synopsized by The Bare Facts Video Guide as \"Buns, walking with Penny, then more buns, rolling into the water, dead\". He also appeared as artist Alan Street in a trilogy of British sex comedies, beginning with The Over-Amorous Artist in 1974.Hamill's other film appearances included Trog (1970), No Blade of Grass (1970), Travels with My Aunt (1972) and Hardcore (1977).Television appearances included: Crossroads, The Shadow of the Tower, Space: 1999, The Venturers, 1990, Doctor Who (in the serial The Ribos Operation), Dennis Potter's play Double Dare, and The Professionals. He left acting in the late 1980s, and went on to run a pine furniture shop.
