She began her career working as a researcher and editorial assistant for Germaine Greer, before becoming a script editor for the soap opera Crossroads. In 2003, she joined the radio soap The Archers as a producer, a position which Oates credits as the majority of her training. After resigning from this job, Oates began working on the ITV soap opera Emmerdale as a script editor, during which time she assisted with the soap's fortieth anniversary celebrations and worked on British Soap Award-winning storylines. She remained in the position until 2012 when she joined Coronation Street as the assistant producer.\nIn October 2012, Oates was announced as the series producer of Emmerdale, a position she began three months later. As series producer, Oates oversaw a surge in the popularity of the programme. Her duration at Emmerdale received positive acclaim from critics of the genre. She resigned from the show and left in December 2015. After leaving Emmerdale, Oates transferred to Coronation Street as the series producer, a move which was praised by ITV personnel. While in the position, the show's ratings and critical acclaim increased, although Oates' darker storylines received mixed critical response and led to the soap being reported to Ofcom for the inclusion of violent imagery during the pre-watershed time frame. Oates announced her resignation from Coronation Street in April 2018, where it was announced that she would join production company Tall Story Pictures producing series 2 of Bancroft. \nOates' hiring by the BBC as the senior executive producer of EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City was announced in August 2018.

The story of Carl's death took the show into 2013, when Kate Oates replaced Blackburn as the new series producer. One of Oates' aims was to feature more of the village and rural countryside locations and to bring more \"balance\" to the show instead of focusing on \"a few very high-profile stories\". Major storylines during this period included a helicopter crash that killed Ruby Haswell (Alicya Eyo) and Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick), and a multi-car pile-up.

She doesn't know that her husband-to-be has this tendency that he also fancies men, so that might be a big surprise to her!\" In an interview with Digital Spy she also said: \"Robert is very different from his brother in that Andy can live in the terraced house in the village with the girl that he's always loved and be happy. He works as a farmhand on the farm where he grew up, he doesn't need any more and he's a really happy guy like that. Robert always wants more \u2013 there's never enough. He's in a position now where he's with Chrissie and he's in the big house on the hill. He's also got Lawrence in his back pocket now, but it's still not enough.

But it's only when you are immersed in it you realise how passionately our audience care about those two characters. They have been through so much and survived it, so the audience are rooting for them and so am I fundamentally. I should also say a quick word on the Robron episode you watched this week. The writer Maxine Alderton, one of our very many talented writers, is a huge Robron fan.
