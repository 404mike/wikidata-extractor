Signing for the club as an amateur in 1954, Spencer was a regular in the reserves before turning professional but remaining as a part-time player while he trained to become an accountant.  After making his Football League debut in December 1954, Spencer appeared sporadically for United, and it was not until his final season that he became a regular in the first team. However, by this point Spencer had begun to struggle with injuries and was forced to retire from playing in the summer of 1957.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Spencer", "response": ["John Spencer may refer to:", "*John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer (1734\u20131783), MP for Warwick 1756\u20131761", "*John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer (1782\u20131845), British politician", "*John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer (1835\u20131910), British politician", "*John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (1924\u20131992), father of Diana, Princess of Wales", "*John Spencer (courtier) (died 1417), a servant of Henry V, MP for Suffolk, and High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1416", "*Sir John Spencer (died 1522) (1455\u20131522), English landowner in Northamptonshire", "*Sir John Spencer (sheriff) (1524\u20131586), MP for Northamptonshire and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire", "*Sir John Spencer (died 1600) (1549\u20131600), MP for Northampton, 1572 and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire 1578,1590", "*John Spencer (Lord Mayor of London) (died 1610), merchant and Lord Mayor of London", "*John Spencer (British politician) (1708\u20131746), father of the 1st Earl Spencer", "*John Spencer (mayor) (born 1946), former mayor of Yonkers, New York and an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate", "*John Spencer (snooker player) (1935\u20132006), English snooker player", "*John Spencer (Scottish footballer) (born 1970), Scottish international football player and manager", "*John Spencer (footballer, born 1934) (1934\u20132007), English football player for Sheffield United", "*John Spencer (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u2013?), English football player for Stoke", "*John Spencer (rugby union) (born 1947), former English national rugby union team captain", "*John Spencer (cricketer, born 1949), former Sussex cricketer", "*John Spencer (cricketer, born 1954), former Wiltshire cricketer", "*John Spencer (rugby) (1880\u20131936), New Zealand rugby player", "*John Spencer (Australian footballer) (1927\u20131998), Australian rules footballer", "*John Spencer (rugby league, born 1946) (1946\u20132021), Australian rugby league player", "*John Spencer (priest) (1630\u20131693), English clergyman and scholar, Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge", "*John Spencer (actor) (1946\u20132005), American actor in television series' including L.A.
