A dozen leeches were administered by his physician but his condition failed to improve.  His doctor then suggested that he rest and have a change of diet.

Requiring assistance he appointed Baptist minister, Rev Charles Arundel Morice Shepherd (1806-1855), who he knew from his visits to the Barnstable area of Devon.

In 1849 Rev Shepard was indisposed and Evans pondered asking Rev Baptist Wriothesley Noel to minister temporarily.  Noel had recently seceded from the Established Church and Evans was of a mind to offer him the chapel on the surrender of his own life interest.  In August 1849 Noel was baptised into the John Street Chapel by Rev Shepherd with Evans in attendance.", "===Rev Baptist Wriothesley Noel===", "The Hon. and Rev.
