During the First World War he was twice prosecuted for works that he published. The first prosecution was for his own pamphlet, The Knock-Out Blow; when fined he refused to pay and was imprisoned. Later he was prosecuted for publishing the controversial novel Despised and Rejected by Rose Allatini, and was again fined. The magazines that he edited and published included work by many of the advanced thinkers of the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Daniel", "response": ["* Charles William Daniel (1871\u20131955), writer and publisher"]}, {"page": "Edgar J.
