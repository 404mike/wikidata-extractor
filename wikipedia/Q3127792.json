Ten centimeter (3\u00a0GHz) microwave radar was in use on British warplanes in late 1941 and proved to be a game changer.  Britain's 1940 decision to share its microwave technology with its US ally (the Tizard Mission) significantly shortened the war.  The MIT Radiation Laboratory established secretly at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1940 to research radar, produced much of the theoretical knowledge necessary to use microwaves.   The first microwave relay systems were developed by the Allied military near the end of the war and used for secure battlefield communication networks in the European theater."]}, {"page": "Cavity magnetron", "response": ["The cavity magnetron was a radical improvement introduced by John Randall and Harry Boot at the University of Birmingham, England in 1940.

Within weeks, engineers at GEC had improved this to well over a kilowatt, and within months 25 kilowatts, over 100\u00a0kW by 1941 and pushing towards a megawatt by 1943. The high power pulses were generated from a device the size of a small book and broadcast from an antenna only centimeters long, reducing the size of practical radar systems by orders of magnitude. New radars appeared for night-fighters, anti-submarine aircraft and even the smallest escort ships, and from that point on the Allies of World War II held a lead in radar that their counterparts in Germany and Japan were never able to close. By the end of the war, practically every Allied radar was based on a magnetron.", "In 1940, at the University of Birmingham in the UK, John Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype of a cavity magnetron that produced about 400\u00a0W. Within a week this had improved to 1\u00a0kW, and within the next few months, with the addition of water cooling and many detail changes, this had improved to 10 and then 25\u00a0kW. To deal with its drifting frequency, they sampled the output signal and synchronized their receiver to whatever frequency was actually being generated. In 1941, the problem of frequency instability was solved by James Sayers coupling (\"strapping\") alternate cavities within the magnetron, which reduced the instability by a factor of 5\u20136.

The most important centre of US research was at the Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab) at MIT but many others took part in the US, and in the UK such as the Telecommunications Research Establishment.  The head of the Fundamental Development Group at Rad Lab was Edward Mills Purcell.  His researchers included Julian Schwinger, Nathan Marcuvitz, Carol Gray Montgomery, and Robert H. Dicke.  Much of the Rad Lab work concentrated on finding lumped element models of waveguide structures so that components in waveguide could be analysed with standard circuit theory.  Hans Bethe was also briefly at Rad Lab, but while there he produced his small aperture theory which proved important for waveguide cavity filters, first developed at Rad Lab.  The German side, on the other hand, largely ignored the potential of waveguides in radar until very late in the war.
