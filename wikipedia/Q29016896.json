Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, drove a car into pedestrians on the pavement along the south side of Westminster Bridge and Bridge Street, injuring more than 50 people, four of them fatally. He then crashed the car into the perimeter fence of the palace grounds and ran into New Palace Yard, where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer. He was then shot by an armed police officer, and died at the scene.\nPolice treated the attack as \"Islamist-related terrorism\". Masood said in a final text message that he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries in the Middle East. Amaq News Agency, which is linked to Islamic State, said the attacker answered the group's calls to target citizens of states that were fighting against it, though the claim was questioned by the UK police and government. Police have found no link with a terrorist organisation and believe Masood acted alone.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of converts to Islam", "response": ["*Khalid Masood (born Adrian Russel Elms) \u2013 British citizen, with a history of once heavy-drinking and drug-use, later adopted extremist beliefs; perpetrator of the 2017 Westminster attack"]}, {"page": "HM Prison Wayland", "response": ["*Khalid Masood, the perpetrator of the 2017 Westminster attack, spent two years at the prison."]}, {"page": "Khalid Masud", "response": ["Abridged version of Maulana Islahi's Tadabbur-i-Qur'an in one volume.Compilation by Khalid Masood", "* Hayat e Rasul e Ummi.Publications by Khalid Masood"]}, {"page": "HM Prison Lewes", "response": ["* Khalid Masood the terrorist shot dead after leading the Westminster attack of 2017, spent time here after convictions of assault, GBH and possession of an offensive weapon "]}, {"page": "HM Prison Ford", "response": ["*Khalid Masood"]}, {"page": "Muslim Engagement and Development", "response": ["MEND's director of engagement Azad Ali has stated that the jihadist 2017 Westminster attack, in which Khalid Masood killed five people, was \"not terrorism\"."]}, {"page": "List of Combined Services (Pakistan) cricketers", "response": ["* Khalid Masood, 1955/56"]}]}}
