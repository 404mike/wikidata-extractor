Because of the previous settlement, Joan was still titled countess, and her new husband became Earl of Gloucester and Hertford. This, however, only lasted for the life of Joan, who died in 1307. Only a few months later, Gilbert was granted his inheritance, and by March 1308 made Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, at the young age of sixteen. This grant was made by Edward\u00a0II, who succeeded his father Edward\u00a0I in July 1307. It was previously believed that Edward\u00a0II and Gilbert were brought up together, but this is based on a confusion with another person of the same name.
