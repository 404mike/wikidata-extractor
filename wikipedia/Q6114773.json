But their form soon took a downturn; following two heavy home defeats in the league in four days, 4\u20130 to Chester and 5\u20130 to Skelmersdale United, and a 4\u20131 defeat in the FA Trophy qualification to Ossett Albion, Quick decided to end his tenure as caretaker manager having lost six games in a row. He quickly replaced himself with Rhodri Giggs, who would act as player-manager, and he began his reign with a 4\u20130 win against Durham City. Results continued to improve under Giggs, managing to win his first six games in charge which resulted in Salford being just outside the promotion places. However, after losing star striker Steve Foster to Chorley in March, Salford lost 6\u20132 to Durham. It was Foster's replacement Jack Redshaw who would help Salford rediscover their form, scoring the second in a 2\u20131 win against Wakefield for the club's first win in seven games, before taking his tally to five goals in four games by scoring both goals in a 2\u20130 win over struggling Leigh Genesis. After picking up four points from six against during the Easter weekend against Prescot Cables and Warrington Town, Salford moved into the top ten, and eventually finished the season in 12th position.", "| 42 ||28 || 7 || 7 || 80 || 45 || 35 || 91 || 1st (of 22)Promotedas champions || Jack Redshaw(17)"]}, {"page": "Karl Moore (footballer)", "response": ["On 8 June 2010, Karl was released along with Martin Petrov, Sylvinho, Jack Redshaw and Benjani."]}, {"page": "Joe Thompson (footballer)", "response": ["On 1 November 2013, it emerged that Thompson had been diagnosed with nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, and that he would immediately begin chemotherapy as treatment for the disease.

The diagnosis shocked his former teammate Jack Redshaw, then teammate Ryan Lowe (who dedicated his goal against Accrington Stanley on 9 November 2013 to him), and former managers, Keith Hill and Ronnie Moore. This led to a campaign for Grow 4 Joe challenge for the player. He later credited tennis player Ross Hutchins, who successfully recovered from the same cancer, as the inspiration for him to fight against cancer.
