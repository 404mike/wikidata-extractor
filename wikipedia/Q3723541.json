May 1603) was an English composer of the late Renaissance who was associated with the English Madrigal School. Born in Cambridge to a musical family, Gibbons was the second surviving son of William Gibbons, a town wait. By 1598 he was known to be living in Cambridge's High ward, and later the Market ward. He owned property in Cambridge and London and probably spent much time there, presumably as a musician of some kind (although this has never been verified). At the age of 28 he became one of only two composers to contribute two pieces to The Triumphs of Oriana, a collection of 25 madrigals published in 1601. These madrigals were Long live faire Oriana and Round about her Charret, with commentators favoring the latter. Some have doubted his authorship of the works, ascribing them to his brothers; no other compositions by Gibbons survive. Two months after his mother's death, his career was cut short by his early death in May 1603, leaving behind his brothers Edward, Ferdinando and Orlando, who would become the most famous musician of the family. Orlando's son, Christopher, was also a noted composer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gibbons (surname)", "response": ["* Ellis Gibbons (1573\u20131603), English composer, brother of Orlando"]}, {"page": "English Madrigal School", "response": ["* Ellis Gibbons (1573\u20131603)"]}, {"page": "The Triumphs of Oriana", "response": ["The Triumphs of Oriana is a book of English madrigals, compiled and published in 1601 by Thomas Morley, which first edition has 25 pieces by 23 composers (Thomas Morley and Ellis Gibbons have two madrigals).
