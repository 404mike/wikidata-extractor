Fritsch became a co-author of the revised edition in 1927. He had a great influence through his own research and also his encouragement to students. As an aid to his own studies on algal taxonomy and morphology, Fritsch brought together published illustrations under the names of the species. After his death this was continued by Dr J.W.G.Lund at the Freshwater Biological Association and became The Fritsch Collection of Illustrations of Freshwater Algae.", "link_mentions": {}}}
