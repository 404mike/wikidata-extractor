He appeared frail yet was full of energy. He was twice recommended for the Victoria Cross, but on the first occasion was considered too young, and on the second too senior. He was wounded in action at the Battle of Majuba during the First Boer War, which rendered his left hand permanently injured.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Viscount Gort", "response": ["*Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton and Vereker Monteith Hamilton, grandsons of the third Viscount Gort"]}, {"page": "Gordon Highlanders", "response": ["*1914\u20131939: Gen.
