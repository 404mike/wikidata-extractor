Note: There is evidence that Jack Baynton was born in 1860, not 1859. According to the FreeBMD website there was no J Baynton born in 1859 in Rushock but there was in the 2nd quarter of 1860. Also, all sources agree Baynton died 17 May 1939. FreeBMD show a John Baynton died aged 79 which leads to a birth in 1860.", "link_mentions": {}}}
