Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra. Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film (). The gigantic scale of the film's troubled production, Taylor's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton's off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname \"Le Scandale\") all generated enormous publicity; Life magazine proclaimed it the \"Most Talked About Movie Ever Made\". Fox's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40\u00a0million. During filming, Burton met and fell in love with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, \"Has anyone ever told you that you're a very pretty girl?\" Taylor later recalled, \"I said to myself, Oy gevalt, here's the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he comes out with a line like that.\" Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her \"Miss Tits\" and opined to Mankiewicz, \"I expect she shaves\"; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first to C\u00e9ligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton's affair with Taylor, cabled him: \"Make up your mind, dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?\". Burton replied \"Both\"."]}, {"page": "Leslie Nielsen", "response": ["Forbidden Planet became an instant success, and roles in other MGM films such as Ransom!

However, dissatisfied with the films he was offered, calling the studios \"a Tiffany, which had forgotten how to make silver\", Nielsen left MGM after auditioning for Messala in the 1959 Ben-Hur.

Vidal said that Boyd was aware of the homosexual subtext to the scene and that the director, the producer and the screenwriter agreed to keep Heston ignorant of the subtext, lest he refuse to play the scene. In turn, on learning of that script-doctor explanation, Charlton Heston said that Vidal had contributed little to the script of Ben-Hur. Despite Vidal's script-doctor resolution of the character's motivations, the Screen Writers Guild assigned formal screenwriter-credit to Karl Tunberg, in accordance with the WGA screenwriting credit system, which favored the \"original author\" of a screenplay, rather than the writer of the filmed screenplay."]}, {"page": "Fred Astaire", "response": ["Astaire played Julian Osborne, a non-dancing character, in the nuclear war drama On the Beach (1959).

I hope 20th Century Fox will keep the roles varied and interesting.\" Whitman said that the production of Murder, Inc. was troubled. First, when he was reading the script, he was under the impression that he was going to play the role for which Peter Falk was already cast, but he was actually cast as the romantic lead. Additionally, director Stuart Rosenberg was fired by the studio because they felt he was taking too much time setting up shots. Once fired, an actor's sitdown strike began, and it was announced that a full strike was going to happen. This put the studio under pressure to finish the project, hence producer Burt Balaban, who shares the directorial credit with Rosenberg, stepped in and finished the film in a week, and on the exact day when the strike started.
