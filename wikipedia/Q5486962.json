He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Derbyshire between 1988 and 1996.\nHaving made his Second XI debut during the 1987 season, he played his debut first-class match during the following season. After Derbyshire had named a squad which did not feature Griffith's name, he was suddenly to find himself called up after many of the players, aggravated at the poor weather, drove away from the August 1988 game.\nTwo weeks after this memorable first appearance, his Derbyshire team played host to the touring Sri Lankans in a drawn three-dayer. Later, he was also to find himself playing for Derbyshire against selected teams of West Indians, Pakistanis, Australians, and South Africans.\nSuch as was the case with several of the Peakites' all-rounders of the early nineties, he barely found comfort in being able to claim better batting or bowling skill either way. Following Griffith's exit in 1996, it had been rumoured that Glamorgan had shown an interest in his name, and a season later, the Welsh county were to win the County Championship.\nAt the end of Griffith's career, he played Minor Counties cricket for Cambridgeshire. Griffith was a middle-lower order batsman. He is currently cricket coach and games master at Chigwell School, Essex.\nFrank Griffith also had a most important spell as an opening bowler for the Middlesex premier division team of Winchmore Hill Cricket Club He opened the bowling with various players including Surry's Carlos Remi and captain Neal Avent, who holds the club's record for 1st 11 premier league games. Griffith currently holds the best lifetime bowling average for the club.\nHis daughter, Cordelia Griffith, currently plays cricket for Essex and Sunrisers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club List A players", "response": ["*Frank Griffith, 1 match, 2000 "]}, {"page": "Frank Griffith", "response": ["Frank Griffith may refer to:", "*Frank Griffith (cricketer) (born 1968), English cricketer", "*Frank Griffith (baseball) (1872\u20131908), Major League baseball player, 1892 Chicago Colts, 1894 Cleveland Spiders"]}, {"page": "Winchmore Hill Cricket Club", "response": ["*Most Wickets in a Season : 65\u00a0\u2013 Frank Griffith (2000)", "* Frank Griffith "]}]}}
