In Mason's view in the period between 1936 and 1941, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's \"will\" or \"intentions\" that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship London : Arnold 2000 page 88. Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution. According to Mason, by 1939, the \u201coverheating\u201d of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000  pages 165-166 Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless \u201csmash and grab\u201d foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000  page 166 Mason's theory of a \"Flight into war\" being imposed on Hitler generated much controversy, and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian Richard Overy over this matter.  Overy maintained the decision to attack Poland was not caused by structural economic problems, but rather was the result of Hitler wanting a localized war at that particular time in history.

Since most of the early functionalist historians were West German, it was often enough for intentionalist historians, especially for those outside Germany, to note that men such as Broszat and Hans Mommsen had spent their adolescence in the Hitler Youth and then to say that their work was an apologia for National Socialism.

At the same time, Kershaw sees considerable merit in the work of such historians as Timothy Mason, Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat and Wolfgang Schieder, who argue that Hitler had no \"programme\" in foreign policy, and instead contend that his foreign policy was simply a kneejerk reaction to domestic pressures in the economy and his need to maintain his popularity.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems & Perspectives of Interpretation, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 137\u2013139"]}, {"page": "Historikerstreit", "response": ["In addition, Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the \"negative myth\" of Nazi Germany that dominates contemporary perceptions.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 4\u20135 Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this \"negative myth\" of Nazi Germany, which cast the Nazi era as the ne plus ultra of evil.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 3\u20134 Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War, the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North, but later \u201crevisionism\u201d became the dominant historical interpretation against the \u201cnegative myth\u201d of the South, which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the \u201cmotives and way of life of the defeated Southern states\u201d, and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 4 Nolte urged that a similar \"revisionism\" destroy the \"negative myth\" of Nazi Germany.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 4, 14\u201315 Nolte argued that the Vietnam War, the Khmer Rouge genocide, the expulsion of \"boat people\" from Vietnam, the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable, and proved the need for \"revisionism\" to put an end to the \"negative myth\" of Nazi Germany.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 5 In Nolte's view, the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor's 1961 book The Origins of the Second World War was only a part of the \"anti-German literature of indictment\" while David Hoggan in Der erzwugnene Krieg, by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939, \"cut himself off from the really decisive questions\".
