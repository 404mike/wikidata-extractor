Born in Burnley, Lancashire he was an outstanding athlete in his school days and went on to play amateur football for Burnley Belvedere. In 1894, at the age of 17, he was invited to a trial with Aston Villa, but his parents would not give him permission to pursue a career in professional football. In 1918, he joined the Burnley board of directors. In January 1925, the club looked within the club to appoint a new manager following the death of former boss John Haworth in December 1924, and Pickles was chosen to take care of first-team duties. He went on to manage Burnley for seven seasons, before resigning in August 1932 following a heavy defeat to Preston North End.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pickles (surname)", "response": ["*Albert Pickles (1877\u20131958), English association football player and manager"]}, {"page": "Albert Pickles", "response": ["Albert Pickles is the name of:", "*Albert Pickles (footballer, born 1877), for Burnley", "*Albert Pickles (footballer, born 1905), for Bradford City"]}, {"page": "History of Burnley F.C.", "response": ["In February 1924, Burnley beat Huddersfield Town 1\u20130 in the FA Cup third round in front of 54,775 supporters, still the record for Turf Moor.
