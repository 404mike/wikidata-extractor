Addressing the question of what shapes his work, Boshier once stated \"Most important is life itself, my sources tend to be current events, personal events, social and political situations, and a sense of place and places\".

I wanted to find a new language for representation... to get away from the idea that figurative art was romantic, that it wasn't tough.\" He was part of a unique generation of students at the Royal College, among which his fellow students were R.

Among his works, Jones entered several paintings of London buses on shaped canvases, which were afterwards put on display at the London West End gallery Arthur Tooth & Sons. One of the gallery's directors then introduced Jones to the work of American pop artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg, which proved inspirational to Jones. In 1961, he took a job teaching lithography at Croydon College of Art in London, where he would remain until 1963. Around this time, Jones was influenced by the works of writers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung. According to Jones, his 1963 painting Hermaphrodite, depicting \"fused male/female couples as metaphors of the creative act,\" draws from both Freud and Nietzsche. In 1963, Jones was awarded the Prix des Jeunes Artistes at the Paris Biennale.

The music on Lodger is based in art rock and experimental rock, but lacks the electronic and ambient styles and the song/instrumental split that defined its two predecessors. Instead, it features more conventional song structures and explores styles such as avant-pop, world and new wave music.

Pop artist Derek Boshier took the accompanying cover photo, portraying Bowie as an accident victim across the gatefold sleeve.", "Bowie collaborated on the cover design for Lodger with English pop artist Derek Boshier, who would later design the artwork for Bowie's 15th studio album Let's Dance (1983). The original gatefold album sleeve featured a full-length shot by photographer Brian Duffy of Bowie in a tiled bathroom looking like an accident victim, heavily made up with an apparently broken nose and a bandaged hand. This was inspired by the self-portraits of Egon Schiele. To accomplish the shot, taken in February 1979 at Duffy's London studio, Bowie balanced himself on a steel frame while the photographer captured the image from above. The broken nose and facial morphing were accomplished using prosthetic make-up and nylon threads. Bowie's bandaged hand was genuine; according to Pegg, he had burned it with coffee that morning and decided to incorporate the hand into the photo. At Bowie's request, the image was taken in a low resolution with a Polaroid\u00a0SX-70 type camera; outtakes from the photoshoot have appeared in the 2014 book Duffy/Bowie \u2013 Five Sessions. The front features a postcard with the album title in four different languages, enhancing its theme of travel.

His paintings are eclectic, studded with allusions both historical, cultural and personal. There is something almost diaristic about his work, but its presentation is anything but linear and logical. Abiding themes are mortality, ageing, sexual identity, popular and youth culture and cinema. There is also a strong element of humour, iconoclasm and irony in his work, from their titles, such as \"Art Can't Fart (for Rose Selavay)\", \"Four Wise Men Looking for God in Abstract Art\", \"Dr Fu Manchu's Death by Gyro\" or \"Ship of Fools (Hello sailor!)\" to comic and grotesque figurative elements and their sometimes lurid but highly resolved colour schemes.
