Soon, a new set of musicians was gathered: Simon Hinkler (who later joined The Mission), David Hinkler, Wayne Furniss, Peter Boam, Gary Wilson, and Cocker's sister, Saskia. They managed to get enough local backing to record a mini-album in late 1982, entitled It (the title was a pun on pulp-it, as if the band were preaching to the audience), which was released in April 1983 by Red Rhino Records. This largely consisted of folkish, romantic pop songs influenced by Leonard Cohen and was a change of direction from the Peel Sessions two years earlier.

Adams recorded four albums with the band and two compilations. As one of the co-founders, Adams' presence was pivotal in its success although his occasionally destructive behaviour brought a level of instability to the line-up. During the first tour of North America, Adams broke his hand while punching the window of the bus and was forced to return to the UK to recover. During the 'Deliverance' tour of 1990 guitarist Simon Hinkler left, signalling serious problems within the band. After the release of the 1992 album Masque, Adams was sacked, with the press reporting Hussey citing personal differences as the main motivation. In the biographical book about The Mission, Names Are For Tombstones, Baby, it states that they were on good terms personally, but that they were going in opposite directions musically."]}, {"page": "Wayne Hussey", "response": ["Hussey started to perform, most notably with Pauline Murray and The Invisible Girls, with whom he started songwriting. The first success for Hussey came when he joined Dead or Alive at the request of frontman Pete Burns. After Burns retreated to become more studio-based, Hussey decided to leave and was offered a position with The Sisters of Mercy, concentrating on 12-string and 6-string guitars, contributing to arrangements and using his higher ranged voice for backing vocals which contrasted with Andrew Eldritch's melancholic baritone. When the Sisters of Mercy disbanded, Hussey and bassist Craig Adams set up The Mission, recruiting Mick Brown on drums and Simon Hinkler on guitars. He lived in Leeds for a while before moving to London towards the end of the 1980s."]}, {"page": "Artery (band)", "response": ["Artery evolved from earlier punk band named 'The' in 1978, with an original lineup of Mark Gouldthorpe (guitar), Toyce Ashley (vocals, guitar), Neil McKenzie (bass) and Garry Wilson (drums).Strong, Martin C.

Their track \"Into the Garden\" reached number nine in the 1982 Festive Fifty. They were often compared to Joy Division, although Gouldthorpe stated \"We never listened to Joy Division \u2013 they were never an influence\". Further lineup changes followed, with John White replacing Fidler, who was sacked for missing rehearsals, Christopher Hendrick replacing MacKenzie, and David Hinkler joining on keyboards. The band was reduced to a trio of Gouldthorpe, Wilson, and Hendrick by the time of the release of their second album, One Afternoon in a Hot Air Balloon (1983), with White leaving to form UV Pop and Simon Hinkler moving into production.
