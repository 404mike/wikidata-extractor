He rose to prominence in 1914 when his painting entitled The Great Sacrifice was reproduced as the souvenir print issued by The Graphic illustrated newspaper with its Christmas number. The painting depicted a young soldier lying dead on the battlefield beneath a vision of Christ on the Cross. It had an immediate appeal to many, and prints were snapped up by churches, schools, and mission halls. One reviewer stated that the print had \"turned railway bookstalls into wayside shrines.\" Framed copies were hung in churches next to Rolls of Honour, and clergymen gave sermons on the theme of the painting. The original oil painting was acquired by Queen Mary, wife of George V but several other copies were made. Clark also painted The Bombardment of the Hartlepools (16 December 1914) (Hartlepool Art Gallery). Clark designed a number of war memorials and his painting was the basis for several memorial stained glass windows in churches.  He executed the scheme of wall paintings in the nave of Holy Trinity Church, Casterton, Cumbria, between 1905 and 1912.James Clark was Queen Alexandra's art teacher and the author of many oils. He was one of two artists commissioned by the Scripture Gift Mission (SGM) to go to the Holy Land, the other being Henry Andrew Harper.

His two main innovations were to make the Bible available free of charge, and to dispatch two painters (James Clark and Henry Andrew Harper) to Palestine to produce illustrations. Both of these were controversial at the time, as it was felt that they devalued the scriptures. SGM produced Bible materials for troops in the Boer War in 1899, and the supply of military items was to become an important part of the mission's work, particularly during the two World Wars. In 1945, the society distributed hundreds of thousands of New Testaments according to the text of the Miniature Bible by Franz Eugen Schlachter to German POWs in English prisons."]}, {"page": "British propaganda during World War I", "response": ["thumb|James Clark - The Great Sacrifice, 1914.", "James Clark's 1914 painting, The Great Sacrifice, was reproduced as the souvenir print issued by The Graphic, an illustrated newspaper, in its Christmas number.

This church has a remarkable collection of glass by Arts and Crafts artists including three stained glass windows by Whall. These include \"The Good Shepherd\" of 1902 and the \"Resurrection\".  \"The Good Shepherd\" is the East window and depicts Christ as the Good Shepherd, with quotations from Psalm 23 in the surrounding scenes.  The window was commissioned by Mr.Leonard Davies in memory of his brother Herbert Davies and the black-faced sheep in the scenes were drawn by Whall's sister-in-law, Alice Chaplin, who was sculptress to Queen Victoria.  It is recorded that the sheep depicted are exact portraits of sheep in the pedigree flock owned by Mr.Davies. The Whall window on the South side of the church is that depicting the \"Resurrection\".  Note the symbolic \"fish nimbus\" which surrounds the figure of Christ.  Whall also designed the window at the back of the choir, this in memory of the late Dr.Image, the uncle of Selwyn Image, a fellow stained glass artist and friend of Whall. Also in St Ethelbert is the window titled \"Come unto Me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" this done by Jasper Brett, a pupil of Christopher Whall. The church also has two stained glass windows which contain no figures but are studies of Herringswell in Spring and Autumn. They are by the artist James ClarkJames Clark (1858-1943) is perhaps best known for his First World War painting of 1918 entitled \"Duty\" or \"A Great Sacrifice\".His window \"The Rich Man's Feast\" of 1898 is held at the Stained Glass Museum in Ely  The church also has a window by Paul Woodroffe another pupil of Whall."]}]}}
