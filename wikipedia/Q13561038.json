Rescued from a raft and returned to Britain, he was interviewed by BBC radio. His famous \"My Name is Frank\" broadcasts during the Battle of the Atlantic affected popular opinion about the war and helped Merchant Navy recruitment efforts in America and Britain.\"Seaman Frank\" became a figurehead of the Merchant Navy in newsreels, speaking tours and autobiographical books. By the war's end, sentiment had moved on and he was largely forgotten. At age 37, he died in a car accident in New York City. Today, the little that is remembered about Laskier is mixed; one observer described him as just an icon of wartime propaganda, but another critic considers Laskier's autobiographical writing to be \"powerful\" and the \"genuine article\" about a seaman's life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran", "response": ["Later that day, lookouts aboard the raider spotted a merchant ship sailing without lights. Sneaking up on the vessel, Kormoran opened fire; her first salvo missed, but within minutes, the target was heavily damaged and aflame. The ship transmitted a distress signal, which Kormoran was unable to jam completely, but this ceased as crew members started to abandon ship. The raider stopped firing, but resumed when the merchantman attempted another transmission, and shore stations responded. Communications intercepts and the code books taken from Afric Star earlier that day revealed the target's identity: the 5,273-ton British freighter Eurylochus, with a cargo of bombers for the Gold Coast. These intercepts also indicated that several parties, including the Air Ministry, were aware of the attack, prompting Detmers to order the torpedoing of Eurylochus. This was accomplished with a single torpedo, sinking the British ship and her cargo at , three and a half hours after Afric Star.Winter (1984), p. 47 39 Chinese and four British crew were recovered by the German raider before she fled the area with British warships  and  in pursuit. Another 28 survivors were found by the Spanish merchant ship Monte Tiede later that night, with 10 men killed during the attack or lost at sea.Winter (1984), pp. 47-8 Eurylochus master was among those rescued by the Allies, and recounted that two ships had attacked, one of them armed with  guns, which led British Naval Intelligence to conclude that the responsible ships were Thor and Admiral Scheer, or an unknown raider operating in concert with one of these.Winter (1984), p. 48 Among the rescued was ship's gunner Frank Laskier who, on returning to England, was interviewed by BBC radio and proved so popular he became a figurehead for Merchant Navy enlistment propaganda for the rest of the war.Lane, The Merchant Seaman's War, p. 55"]}, {"page": "Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*Frank Laskier: WWII Merchant Navy steward who became a public icon for recruitment efforts."]}, {"page": "Alexey Stakhanov", "response": ["* Frank Laskier"]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Frank Laskier: WWII sailor who was a public icon for recruiting new mariners."]}, {"page": "Laskier", "response": ["*Frank Laskier (1912\u20131948), British seaman famous during World War II"]}, {"page": "Seaman Frank", "response": ["#REDIRECTFrank Laskier"]}, {"page": "My Name is Frank", "response": ["#REDIRECTFrank Laskier"]}, {"page": "British merchant seamen of World War II", "response": ["# Frank Laskier \u2013 Merchant seaman author of \"My Name is Frank\"."]}]}}
