In 1997 he won a competition to find a British Tiger Woods. He went on to have a successful amateur career, winning several tournaments and gaining many representative honours, in addition to becoming the youngest English player ever to qualify for The Open Championship in 1999. He turned professional in 2003 but a car crash that resulted in an injury to his neck severely affected his early career.Scotland finally earned his place on the European Tour by finishing inside the top 120 on the Order of Merit in 2007 despite having limited playing opportunities. However he failed to establish himself during his maiden season in 2008 and was back competing on the second tier Challenge Tour the following year. Scotland later played in lower-tier tours including PGA EuroPro Tour and the Dubai-based MENA Golf Tour, winning the MENA Tour's Order of Merit in 2013. Scotland played in the European Tour's Q School in 2013 and made it to the final stage, but finished 57th. Scotland has ten wins on the MENA Tour, the most by any player.Scotland is the nephew of former Attorney General Baroness Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zane", "response": ["*Zane Scotland (born 1982), British golfer"]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["| align=\"center\"|2000 || Turnberry, Scotland || align=\"right\"|Great Britain  & Ireland   Zane Scotland  || align=\"center\"|16 || align=\"center\"|8 ||  Continent of Europe  Charlie Westrup  || ", "*2000 Yasin Ali, Stephen Buckley, Jack Doherty, David Inglis, Derek McNamara, David Porter, Zane Scotland, Richard Scott, Joshua Simons", "*1999 Nick Dougherty, Scott Godfrey, Sandeep Grewal, Barry Hume, David Inglis, Mark O'Sullivan, David Porter, David Price, Zane Scotland"]}, {"page": "St Andrews Trophy", "response": ["*  Zane Scotland 2002"]}, {"page": "The John Fisher School", "response": ["* Zane Scotland, PGA Tour golfer (during the selection policy)"]}, {"page": "MAN N\u00d6 Open", "response": ["| 2007 || Anders Schmidt Hansen ||  || align=center|269 || align=center|\u221211 || 3 strokes ||  Zane Scotland"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Zane Scotland||1982\u2013"]}, {"page": "2010 Open Championship", "response": [":Fairmont St Andrews: Laurie Canter (a), Mark Haastrup, Zane Scotland"]}, {"page": "Anders Schmidt Hansen", "response": ["| Zane Scotland"]}, {"page": "MENA Tour", "response": ["| 2013 || Zane Scotland ||  || align=center|50,229 || Mustapha El Maouas ||  || "]}, {"page": "2016 MENA Golf Tour", "response": ["| Zane Scotland (9)", "| Zane Scotland (10)", "|Zane Scotland"]}, {"page": "David Law (golfer)", "response": ["| Zane Scotland"]}, {"page": "Spanish International Amateur Championship", "response": ["| Zane Scotland"]}]}}
