In his book, Caldwell proposed that there are Dravidian words in the Hebrew of the Old Testament, the archaic Greek language, and the places named by Ptolemy.Caldwell married Eliza Mault, the daughter of another missionary posted in India.

Another states he was an outcast, born to a Pariah woman and Brahmin father. Mu Raghava Iyengar speculated that \"valluva\" in his name is a variation of \"vallabha\", the designation of a royal officer. S.

H. A. Stuart, in his Census Report of 1891, claimed that Valluvans were a priestly class among the Paraiyars and served as priests during Pallava reign, and similarly Robert Caldwell, J. H. A. Tremenheere and Edward Jewitt Robinson, too, claimed that Valluvar was a Paraiyar. Valluvar was likely married to a woman named Vasuki and lived in Mylapore.
