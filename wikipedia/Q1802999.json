Despite defeating Rangers 2\u20131 at Ibrox in his first match, his time at Celtic Park was unsuccessful. Macari made several moves in the transfer market - none of them particularly successful. Gerry Creaney, one of the few consistent goalscorers at Celtic at that time, was played out of position on the right-wing for several weeks before being sold to Portsmouth for \u00a3600,000. Striker Willie Falconer was signed from Sheffield United, right-back Lee Martin and goalkeeper Carl Muggleton came north from England, and in what is considered one of Macari's poorest moves, Andy Payton moved to Barnsley in a part-exchange deal for journeyman striker Wayne Biggins. A miserable 4\u20132 defeat by Rangers in the New Year fixture at Parkhead left Celtic languishing in the league. An early Scottish Cup exit in January 1994 at Motherwell sealed another dismal season for Celtic.

He played 26 games in the 1986\u201387 season, as an under-performing United side cost manager Ron Atkinson his job. Gibson made 33 starts in the 1987\u201388 season, as the \"Red Devils\" finished second in the league behind Liverpool. After the season ended he was rarely involved in first team games due to manager Alex Ferguson's decision to field Lee Martin as left-back, and was also beset with injury problems which kept him out of action for protracted periods of time. He played just three first team games in the entire 1988\u201389 season.

Manchester United had the first chance of the game in the second minute, when they were awarded a penalty by the referee, Mario van der Ende; a free kick from the right wing was hit to the far side of the penalty area by Lee Martin, where the ball was met by Gary Pallister, only for his header back across the box to be blocked by the arm of Red Star centre-back Miodrag Belodedici, who received a yellow card for handball. Manchester United captain Steve Bruce placed the penalty kick to the right of Red Star goalkeeper Zvonko Milojevi\u0107, who palmed the ball round the post. United had another chance at goal four minutes later, when Milojevi\u0107 saved a shot from Mark Hughes.

Pan\u010dev just missed the goal with a 20-yard volley, before heading wide from a free kick.
