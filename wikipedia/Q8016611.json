Returning to England, he was assistant director at the George Frideric Handel commemorations in Westminster Abbey and the Pantheon in 1784, and composed a number of anthems for royal usage. He gained a doctorate in music at Oxford University in 1790. In his spare time, he acted as a magistrate for the jurisdiction near his house in Portman Square.He was knighted by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Jeffreys Pratt, second Earl Camden in 1795, thus becoming the first British musician honoured with a knighthood. An unremarkable composer and musician, he gained the title more through tutoring the king's family and his contacts than any merit, being a friend of several members of the royal family and composers such as Joseph Haydn. Few of his compositions survive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Master of the Queen's Music", "response": ["Boyce died in 1779, and was succeeded as Master by another former pupil of Greene, John Stanley, who held the post until he died in 1786.

The terms in which he speaks of the enslaved peoples and their character belongs to the age in which that system was deeply entrenched, but in which the movement for emancipation was gathering momentum. He appealed to the vital importance of maintaining civilized, humane standards of management, health, social organization and justice for those populations. However, he approved the continuance of the system itself, for although he considered it repugnant, he argued that greater suffering and degradation would result from abandoning or attempting to dismantle it. The essay includes a brief letter of dedication to (Sir) William Parsons, Master of the King's Musick, who had given Beckford unsolicited assistance.W.
