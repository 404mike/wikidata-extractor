After Goelet\u2019s death the yacht stayed in family hands, but in WWI it was transferred to the US Navy.  During the prohibition years in America it had been used as a rum-runner for Sir Brodrick C. D. A. Hartwell, who lost money on the venture.  Kerr and Thynne sold their interest in the yacht to Marine Products in exchange for 250,000 ordinary shares. Ehrenreich sold his British and Colonial patent rights to the company using this same arrangement.  The yacht's conversion to a factory ship included the installation of leather tanning drums, tanks, incinerators, oil extraction and drying plant for fins and meat; the main deck was reserved for handling the catch and for the ten motor boats used in catching the sharks.  The Istar could process thirty tons of sharks per, day with sufficient storage for a hundred days work."]}]}}
