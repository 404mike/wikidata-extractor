As a school boy, he conducted water analysis with the Leeds City Analyst. He studied chemistry at the University of Leeds with Julius B. Cohen, and then he worked with Albrecht Kossel on arginase at the University of Heidelberg. He joined Columbia University in 1905, working in the lab of Christian Herter. During his work on amino acids he obtained his PhD from Leeds. In 1905, he was one of the first scientists to successfully synthesise adrenaline in the laboratory (see: History of catecholamine research).\nIn 1914 he went back to England to offer his service with the war effort. Due to a request for a chemist by Alexis Carrel to the Rockefeller Institute, Dakin joined Carrel in 1916 at a temporary hospital in Compi\u00e8gne. There they developed the Carrel\u2013Dakin method of wound treatments. This consisted of intermittently irrigating the wound with Dakin's solution, a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in common liquid bleach products) and boric acid.  In the process, he analyzed more than 200 candidate substances, and developed quantitative methods to evaluate their effectiveness for disinfection and wound healing. The solution is still widely used for that purpose, as of 2013. The World War I era Rockefeller War Demonstration Hospital (United States Army Auxiliary Hospital No. 1) was created, in part, to promote the Carrel\u2013Dakin method:\n\"The war demonstration hospital of the Rockefeller Institute was planned as a school in which to teach military surgeons the principles of and art of applying the Carrel-Dakin treatment.\"\nAfter he married the widow of Christian Herter in 1916, he worked in his private laboratory in Scarsdale, New York and had several close collaborations with other scientists. His main working fields were amino acids and enzymes. The extraction of amino acids from hydrolyzed peptides by butanol was invented by him. He also was interested in organic chemistry and synthesis, and devised the Dakin reaction and the Dakin\u2013West reaction.\nHe died shortly after the death of his wife in early 1952.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexis Carrel", "response": ["During World War I (1914\u20131918), Carrel and the English chemist Henry Drysdale Dakin developed the Carrel\u2013Dakin method of treating wounds based on chlorine (Dakin's solution) which, preceding the development of antibiotics, was a major medical advance in the care of traumatic wounds. For this, Carrel was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.  Carrel also advocated the use of wound debridement (cutting away necrotic or otherwise damaged tissue) and irrigation of wounds.  His method of wound irrigation involved flushing the tissues with a high volume of antiseptic fluid so that dirt and other contaminants would be washed away (this is known today as \"mechanical irrigation.\") The World War I era Rockefeller War Demonstration Hospital (United States Army Auxiliary Hospital No. 1) was created, in part, to promote the Carrel\u2013Dakin method:"]}, {"page": "Chlorine", "response": ["Much later, during World War I in 1916, a standardized and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer was developed by Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area).
