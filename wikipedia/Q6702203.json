However the promotion campaign faltered, and despite beating champions Lincoln City on the final day, Colchester ended in eighth-place, a point outside the play-offs. He released Mikael Mandron in the summer, along with Ryan Gondoh.

After replacing Chris Hackett in the 57th minute, he scored Northampton's second goal in a 2\u20130 victory. He bagged his second Northampton goal in his third match for the club, following up fellow Brentford loanee Luke Norris' opener in a 3\u20132 defeat to Rochdale on 22 October. On 5 November, Dallas' loan was extended until 1 January 2014. He scored the only goal of the game against Accrington Stanley on 30 November. An injury suffered to Brentford's on-loan Cardiff City winger Kadeem Harris meant that Dallas was recalled early from his loan on 23 December. He made 12 appearances for Northampton and scored three goals. Of his time at Northampton, Dallas said \"on a personal note my loan spell was OK. I was playing every week. It was a good experience but results did not go our way and it was hard, when you are at the bottom everything seems to go against you\". He also remarked that the training was less intense than he was used to at Brentford. Dallas signed a new two-year contract at Brentford on 13 November, which would have kept him at Griffin Park until the end of the 2015\u201316 season. Dallas found his minutes on the pitch limited during the early months of 2014, but he broke into the starting lineup in April, starting in six of the Bees' final seven games of the season. Dallas scored his first Brentford goal with what turned out to be a consolation in a 4\u20131 defeat to Colchester United on 26 April. He made it two in two games when he scored the opener in a 2\u20130 win over Stevenage on the final day.
