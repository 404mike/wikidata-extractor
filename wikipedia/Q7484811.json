Originally published in March 2005 in the Africa Issue of the LIP Magazine, the essay defines an Afropolitan identity, sensibility and experience. The critiques of the Afropolitan, as portrayed by Selasi in Bye-Bye, Babar, condemn its elitism and class biased approach. Susanne Gehrmann states that Selasi's Afropolitan \"is addicted to urban hip life\" and \"international careers\". However, the essay is important in discussing where emigrants of Africa fit into the spectrum of African. Knudsen and Rahbek suggest that Bye-Bye, Babar \"is an integral part [in the] ongoing conversation about the relationship between identity and individuality\" in the way that it \"speaks to the individual\" who may feel alone in the sense that they do not have \"labels or identities\" to understand their positioning in the world.Knudsen, Eva Rask, and Ulla Rahbek.
