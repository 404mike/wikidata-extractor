The list is by season, this being the season in which the player's name first appears in surviving sources.\nCricket underwent radical changes during the 18th century. Patronage and popular support enabled it to outgrow its roots as a village pastime and develop into a major sport. In the early 1760s, pitched delivery bowling was introduced and this necessitated the invention of the straight bat: an evolution in bowling and batting techniques that radically changed cricket.\nThe earliest known scorecards date from 1744 but it was not until 1772 that they began to be completed and are preserved on a regular basis.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Jackson", "response": ["George Jackson may refer to:", "*George Jackson (Australian politician) (1856\u20131938), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*George Jackson (Canadian politician) (1808\u20131885), Canadian mill operator, MP from Ontario", "*George Jackson (Irish politician) (1761\u20131805), Member of Parliament for Mayo 1801\u20131802", "*Sir George Duckett, 1st Baronet (1725\u20131822), born George Jackson, British politician and MP", "*George Jackson (Virginia politician) (1757\u20131831), U.S. Representative from Virginia", "*George Jackson (activist) (1941\u20131971), American Black Panther, prisoner, and author", "*George Jackson (baseball) (1882\u20131972), American Major League Baseball player from 1911 to 1913", "*George Jackson (cricketer), English cricketer of the mid-18th century", "*George Jackson (footballer, born 1952), footballer who played in the Football League for Stoke City", "*George Jackson (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131985), English footballer for Merthyr Town, Tranmere Rovers and South Liverpool", "*George Jackson (footballer, born 1987), Brazilian footballer, full name George Jackson dos Santos Souza", "*George Jackson (animator) (1920\u20131986), British animator", "*George Jackson (music producer) (born 1969), American music producer, DJ, and remixer from Chicago", "*George Jackson (producer) (1958\u20132000), American film producer", "*George Jackson (songwriter) (1945\u20132013), American songwriter, singer and musician", "*George Jackson (Brookside), a character on UK soap opera Brookside played by Cliff Howells", "*George Jackson (botanist) (1790\u20131811), English botanist", "*George Jackson (plasterwork) (1766\u20131840), British plasterwork innovator", "*\"George Jackson\" (song), a 1971 song by Bob Dylan", "*George Jackson Churchward (1857\u20131933), GWR railway engineer"]}, {"page": "Addington Cricket Club", "response": ["Addington Cricket Club fielded one of the strongest cricket teams in England from about the 1743 season to the 1752 season although the village of Addington is a very small place in Surrey about three miles south-east of Croydon.

Three of its players were reported to be involved in the London v Slindon match at the Artillery Ground on Saturday, 2 June 1744. The match, which Slindon won by 55 runs, was a major event at the time and its legacy is the world's oldest known scorecard (i.e., which lists the names and scores of all players). The three Lingfield players were not specifically identified but it is possible that they included Collins of Surrey and two players called Stevens. The report says that the team included one player from Addington but there were four Addington players involved in the match and it is possible that one or more of these were connected with Lingfield: Tom Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris and George Jackson.
