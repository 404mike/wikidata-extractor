Bratby did various kitchen and bathroom-themed paintings, including three paintings of toilets.

Oxford University Press. p. 259. \"John Bratby 1928\u20131992\". Tate. Retrieved 6 January 2014. Kitchen sink realism artists painted everyday objects, such as trash cans and beer bottles. The critic David Sylvester wrote an article in 1954 about trends in recent English art, calling his article \"The Kitchen Sink\" in reference to Bratby's picture. Sylvester argued that there was a new interest among young painters in domestic scenes, with stress on the banality of life.

It began in the early 1950s and has been considered an aspect of John Osborne's \"Angry Young Men\" movement. Artists Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch and Jack Smith were also active in the development of the movement. Bratby often painted with bright colours, capturing his middle-class family's daily lives. The faces of his subjects often appeared desperate and unsightly. Bratby painted several kitchen subjects, often turning practical utensils such as sieves and spoons into semi-abstract shapes. He also painted bathrooms, and made three paintings of toilets. Initially there was some critical interest, but English critics later disregarded it as an important movement."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Jack Smith, painter"]}, {"page": "John Moores Painting Prize", "response": ["* 1957 Jack Smith - \"Creation and Crucifixion\""]}, {"page": "Albert Irvin", "response": ["His influences included Walter Sickert, Henri Matisse, JMW Turner, Jack Smith and Edward Middleditch.Albert Irvin: Painting into Life "]}, {"page": "High Risk Books", "response": ["|Jack Smith", "|Wait for Me at the Bottom of the Pool: The Writings of Jack Smith"]}, {"page": "Donald Hamilton Fraser", "response": ["As an adolescent, Fraser attended the Maidenhead Grammar School in Berkshire, England.
