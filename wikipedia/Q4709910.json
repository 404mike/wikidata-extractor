He had some correspondence with Wilhelm Cauer on the subject of filter designs.He published a treatment of geometrically symmetrical 2-port networks in 1927 and is responsible for Bartlett's bisection theorem which shows that any symmetrical network can be transformed into a symmetrical lattice network.He also patented the idea of using the method of an active amplifier with \"negative resistance\" to cancel the inductance of a telephone line.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bartlett's bisection theorem", "response": ["Bartlett's bisection theorem is an electrical theorem in network analysis attributed to Albert Charles Bartlett.

The theorem often appears in filter theory where the lattice network is sometimes known as a filter X-section following the common filter theory practice of naming sections after alphabetic letters to which they bear a resemblance."]}, {"page": "A.C.
