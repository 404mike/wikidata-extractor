The club were hit by financial troubles after being told they had to pay fines totalling \u00a3250,000, and at one point were at risk of being wound up. As a result, Horton was forced to cope without assistant John Askey, after Askey was dismissed to cut costs. The sale of top-scorer Jon Parkin also robbed Horton of his best player. Following a poor start to the season he placed four players on the transfer-list. He also placed Kevin Townson on the transfer-list, before sacking the striker after Townson displayed \"serious misconduct\". Throughout the campaign, Horton signed goalkeeper Tommy Lee, striker Clyde Wijnhard, midfielder Alan Navarro, forward Allan Russell, and striker Matty McNeil. The \"Silkmen\" finished in 17th-place, five points above the relegation zone. Horton prepared for the 2006\u201307 campaign by searching for a new midfield player, and found one in Shrewsbury Town's Jamie Tolley. He also signed versatile attacker Colin Heath, defender Carl Regan, and former Port Vale goalkeeper Jonny Brain; whilst releasing five players. Horton was sacked in October 2006, after his team failed to win any of their opening twelve league games, leaving them bottom of the Football League."]}, {"page": "Luke Howell", "response": ["The next season, Howell starts his season as he suffered a knocks and continued to be in and out of the first team through injury and just made 18 appearances, mainly in the second half of the season.

He also played twice in the 2009 League One Playoff semi-finals against Scunthorpe United, where he was taken off in the second leg with concussion and was replaced by Alan Navarro in the 17th minute. In the end of the second leg League One Playoff semi-finals, MK Dons would lose 7\u20136 on penalties after playing 120 minutes and Scunthorpe United went on to win the play-offs, promoted to the Championship.
