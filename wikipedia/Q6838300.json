He admitted as a youngster he was more serious about his cricket, playing at the time with Scarborough Cricket Club in Western Australian Grade Cricket alongside test stars Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, Sam Gannon, Mick Malone, Greg Shipperd and Tom Hogan. It was not until his older brother Rod invited him to play at Teachers Training College Churchlands in the E Grade of the Western Australian Amateur Football League (WAAFL) that football became Buckenara's first sporting love, and he excelled, winning the E Grade best and fairest in 1977. In 1979 he began his senior League career with  and quickly attracted attention from Victorian clubs, finishing runner-up in the Tom Outridge Medal in each of his three seasons with the club.

However a 40-run partnership between Bob Woolmer and Peter Willey, and a 44-run partnership between Derek Randall (41), and Willey who made 50, steadied the ship. But the Australian bowlers lacked the penetration of the usual opening bowling partnership of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, who had caused so much discomfort on the previous tour. Despite this, once the partnership of Willey and Randell was broken, wickets began to fall at regular intervals, the only other notable contributions being 14 from Tony Greig and 15 from Phil Edmonds. Gary Cosier was the pick of the Australian bowlers with 4 for 18 off 6.3 overs.

The Australians won the toss and batted first. The tourists' innings could not have got off to a worse start, with opener Ian Davis clean bowled by Kevin Jarvis for a first ball duck. The innings recovered though, with Craig Serjeant and Kim Hughes adding 79 for the second wicket, but once Serjeant had been removed for 55, Gary Cosier followed him next over without adding to the score, leaving Australia on 79 for 3. The tourists ended day one on 119 for 3. Solid but unimpressive middle order efforts followed from Doug Walters (23), Richie Robinson (18), and Rod Marsh (23) dragged Australia past 200, but with the weather again threatening to disrupt play, and wanting some bowling practice, the Australians declared on 240 for 7, Ray Bright not out on 11, and Max Walker not out on 16. Jeff Thomson made his first appearance for the tourists, opening the bowling from the Pavilion End. However it was first change bowler Ray Bright who got the breakthrough, having Graham Johnson caught behind by Marsh for 17. Charles Rowe went for a duck next over off the bowling of Mick Malone, but rain soon interrupted play, and the rest of day two was washed out. The rain had set in, and no additional play was managed on day three, with the second game in a row ending in a draw.", "Thankfully for the tourists Gloucestershire were even poorer.
