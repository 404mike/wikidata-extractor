He moved to London in 1967, where his first performance was opening for Al Stewart at the Marquee Club in Soho. He released his Pass the Distance LP in 1970, which in later years attained legendary status as it was so hard to obtain. The album featured contributions from Robert Buckland, Paul Burwell, Ken Elliot, and David Toop. \"Pass the Distance\" was remastered and re-released on Durtro/Jnana records in 2004 and again in 2008 on vinyl by Mayfair Music. In the same year, after a thirty-five-year absence from the music scene, he began touring again. His first performance was in support of the band Current 93 at St George the Martyr Church in Toronto in June 2004. Since then, he has performed in Moscow, Athens, Glasgow, Barcelona, New York City, Chicago and many other cities around the world. His second album, Magic Moments, was his first new recording in 35 years and was released by Durtro/Jnana.\nFinn resided in Montreal, Canada for most of the interim, and now divides his time between London and Montreal. He had been touring extensively both as a solo artist and as a member of Current 93. He is now again strictly a solo artist.  His latest release, Accidental Life, appeared in July 2007 on his own label Ten-to-One.\nSimon Finn has played shows with Current 93, Graham Coxon, Thurston Moore, Antony and the Johnsons, Blood on a Feather and more.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Not Alone (album)", "response": ["#Simon Finn - \"Crow Flies\""]}, {"page": "Karl Blake", "response": ["*Simon Finn: Accidental Life (CD, 2007)"]}, {"page": "List of songs about Jerusalem", "response": ["*\"Jerusalem\" by Simon Finn"]}, {"page": "Donaufestival", "response": ["*Simon Finn"]}, {"page": "Durtro", "response": ["* Simon Finn"]}, {"page": "Finn (surname)", "response": ["* Simon Finn (musician) (born 1951), English musician", "* Simon Finn (politician) (born 1965), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "List of psychedelic folk artists", "response": ["*Simon Finn"]}, {"page": "Plastic Crimewave", "response": ["Some of the musicians Crimewave has interviewed for GZD include Arthur Brown, John Renbourn, Clive Palmer of Incredible String Band, Simeon of Silver Apples, Michael Karoli and Damo Suzuki of Can, Vashti Bunyan, Peter Daltrey of Kaleidoscope, Judy Dyble of Fairport Convention, Martin Carthy, Sixto Rodriguez, Dick Taylor of The Pretty Things, Pip Proud, Dave Lambert of The Strawbs, Simon Finn, Susan Jacks and Craig McCaw of The Poppy Family and Michael Rother of Neu!, Edgar Broughton, Judy Dyble, Jesse Hector, Peter Daltrey of Kaleidoscope, etc.", "Crimewave curates the celebrated Million Tongues Festival in Chicago.
