Morgan was the manager and secretary of Coventry City, then known as Singers FC, from 1887 to 1893.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["In 1887 Singers appointed J.G. Morgan as club secretary, and he oversaw a transformation of the club into a serious operation. Morgan was the first official at the club who did not play and fulfilled a role similar to a modern manager. Singers relocated from their original pitch at Dowells Field to an enclosed ground called Stoke Road, located just to the south of the future Highfield Road location. The ground had a small stand and entrances close to the White Lion and Binley Oak pubs, where an admission fee of two pence was charged. The club played an organized fixture list for the first time in the 1887\u201388 season and also entered the Birmingham Junior Cup, reaching the semi-final. The following five seasons have been described by club historians as a \"golden age\", as the club's performances and attendances, as well as the quality of their opponents, improved steadily. Capitalising on the renewed interest in football within the city, Rudge F.C., attached to the rival Rudge Cycle Company, began to achieve their own success. Singers and Rudge developed a fierce rivalry, fuelled by competition between the two bicycle companies. Games between the two clubs attracted crowds as high as 4,000 by the end of the 1880s."]}]}}
