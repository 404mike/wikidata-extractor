He first came to prominence in 1965 when \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\", a song that he wrote and sang while still an undergraduate, achieved chart success. As an independent producer, he discovered and named the rock band Genesis in 1967, producing their first album From Genesis to Revelation. He founded his own label UK Records in 1972. He released and produced songs for 10cc and the Bay City Rollers. In the 1970s King became known for hits that he performed and/or produced under different names, including \"Johnny Reggae\", \"Loop di Love\", \"Sugar, Sugar\", \"Hooked on a Feeling\", \"Una Paloma Blanca\" and \"It Only Takes a Minute\"; between September 1971 and 1972 alone he produced 10 top 30 singles in the UK. Rod Liddle, in 2010, described him as  \"truly talented\" and someone who could \"storm the pop charts at will, under a hundred different disguises\".  The Guardian reported in 2002 that he had sold over 40 million records during his career.While living in New York in the 1980s, King appeared on radio and television in the UK, including on the BBC's Top of the Pops and Entertainment USA. In the early 1990s he produced the Brit Awards, and from 1995 he selected and produced the British entries for the Eurovision Song Contest, including the winning entry in 1997, \"Love Shine a Light\" by Katrina and the Waves.In September 2001, King was convicted of child sexual abuse and sentenced to seven years in prison for having sexually assaulted five boys, aged 14 and 15, in the 1980s. In November 2001, he was acquitted of 22 similar charges. He was released on parole in March 2005. A further trial for sexual offences against teenage boys resulted in several not guilty verdicts and the trial being abandoned in June 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Creation", "response": ["* \"Creation\", a song by Jonathan King, 1965"]}, {"page": "December 6", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Jonathan King, English singer-songwriter, record producer, music entrepreneur, television/radio presenter, and convicted sex offender"]}, {"page": "1944", "response": ["** Jonathan King, British music producer"]}, {"page": "Pet Shop Boys", "response": ["1987 started with Pet Shop Boys receiving both a BRIT Award and Ivor Novello Award for \"West End Girls\".

Following Phillips' departure, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded Nursery Cryme (1971). Their live shows began to feature Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. Foxtrot (1972) was their first hit in the UK and Selling England by the Pound (1973) reached number three there, featuring their first UK hit \"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\".

When they wished to have them professionally recorded they sought Charterhouse alumnus Jonathan King, who seemed a natural choice as their publisher and producer following the success of his 1965 UK top five single, \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\".

He signed the group and suggested a band name of Gabriel's Angels, but it was unpopular with the other members. They settled on King's other suggestion, Genesis. After King suggested they stick to more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote \"The Silent Sun\" as a pastiche of the Bee Gees, one of King's favourite bands.
