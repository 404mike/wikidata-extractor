Feature Animation's first announced project. Bill Kroyer and Frederik Du Chau were announced as the directors, with Sue Kroyer serving as co-producer. The initial story centered around a young female character named Susannah who embarks on a dangerous quest for the Holy Grail to save her sister from a ruthless and powerful knight. The film was put into production before the story was finalized. However, during the fall of 1995, the animators were reassigned to finish Space Jam (1996). Meanwhile, in April 1996, Christopher Reeve was cast as King Arthur. During the interim, several story changes were made that resulted in creative differences between the Kroyers and the studio management. In particular, the Holy Grail was replaced with Excalibur, in which Warner Bros. Feature Animation president Max Howard felt better reflected the film's setting: \"The symbol of Camelot is the power of Excalibur, and that became a more interesting theme: Whoever held the sword, held the power.\" By the middle of 1996, the Kroyers were allegedly fired by Howard,  who later moved on to developing another project at Warner Bros. Feature Animation."]}, {"page": "The King and I (1999 film)", "response": ["After the success of Walt Disney Animation Studios' The Little Mermaid in 1989 Warner Bros. began to seek out animated films to distribute, which led to them releasing The Nutcracker Prince and Rover Dangerfield, in 1990 and 1991, respectively.

Warner Bros. distributed Thumbelina, and New Line Cinema distributed The Swan Princess in 1994, before releasing their first internally created feature film Space Jam in 1996. With the film a financial success, the next film was quickly underway Quest for Camelot.
