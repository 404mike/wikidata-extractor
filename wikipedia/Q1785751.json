Caveman and Outlaw Posse developed a jazz influenced style, whilst MC Mell'O' mixed jazz and hardcore. London Posse, Black Radical Mk II and DJ Ruf Cut And Tuf C were more influenced by reggae and disco whilst the Wee Papa Girl Rappers, Cookie Crew and Monie Love achieved chart success with more radio-friendly hip hop. However, despite the chart success of some British-born hip hop artists \u2013 for example Monie Love, Slick Rick, Young MC and MF Doom, who all moved to the US \u2013 the majority of the scene was still underground and small scale.", "A mindset began to develop \u2013 typified by the Gunshot tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or Son of Noise's \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. Silver Bullet's chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and Rebel MC were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity."]}, {"page": "Silver Bullet", "response": ["Silver Bullet(s) or The Silver Bullet may refer to:", "* The Silver Bullet (1935 film), an American western film", "* The Silver Bullet (1942 film), an American western film", "* Silver Bullet (film), a 1985 horror film by Daniel Attias", "* Silver Bullets, a 2011 film by Joe Swanberg", "* Silver Bullet (rapper) (born 1972), British rapper", "* Silver Bullets (album) or the title song, by the Chills, 2015", "* \"Silver Bullet\", a song by Hawthorne Heights from The Silence in Black and White", "* \"Silver Bullet\", a song by Pixies from Beneath the Eyrie", "* Silver Bullet Band, the 1970s\u20131990s backing band for Bob Seger", "* Silver Bullet (Frontier City), a roller coaster in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, US", "* Silver Bullet (Knott's Berry Farm), a roller coaster in Buena Park, California, US", "* The Silver Bullet, a music venue in London", "* Silver Bullet (car), a 1929 unsuccessful land speed record car", "* Colorado Silver Bullets, a women's baseball team", "* Comics Bulletin, originally Silver Bullet Comics, a website covering the American comic-book industry", "* Coors Light, a beer referred to as \"the Silver Bullet\" in marketing campaigns", "* Hughes H-1 Racer or Silver Bullet, a 1935 racing aircraft", "* Silver Bullet Express, a 1990s ski train in Maine, US", "* \"No Silver Bullet\", a 1986 paper on software engineering by Fred Brooks"]}, {"page": "Hip hop", "response": ["By 1984, youth worldwide were embracing the hip hop culture.
