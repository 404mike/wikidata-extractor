There was some confusion over his candidacy as he expected to be endorsed as the representative of the coalition government. However he failed to receive the coalition coupon due to differences among activists in the constituency. Both he and A E Hervey, a \"Democratic Labour and Coalition\" candidate fought the election as supporters of the government. They were opposed by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, the official Labour Party candidate and A. E. Jay of the National Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers. Malone won the seat, with a slim majority of 853 votes over Labour. At the next contest in 1922, Malone held the seat with an increased majority of 1,602 votes. However, a year later Percy Alden of the Labour Party unseated him. He regained the seat a year later, with a majority of 1,501 votes. At the next election in 1929, an increase in the Labour vote saw Malone lose the seat to Frederick Messer in a four-cornered contest, with Liberal and Communist candidates also taking part."]}, {"page": "List of members of the London School Board", "response": ["| Rev.
