They were amongst the first large group of New Zealand rugby league players to play their professional rugby league in England and such was their subsequent commitment to the British game that in 1986 the British Government & Rugby Football League changed rules and by laws regarding overseas players to take those who had shown such commitment outside of the overseas player quotas. Kemble played  in Hull FC's 18-7 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1982 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1982\u201383 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 2 October 1982, played  in the 13-2 victory over Castleford in the 1983 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1983\u201384 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 15 October 1983, played , and scored 2-tries in the 29-12 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1984\u201385 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 27 October 1984, and played  in the 24-31 defeat by Castleford in the 1986 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1986\u201387 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 11 October 1986. Kemble played  in Hull FC's 0-12 defeat by Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984\u201385 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984\u201385 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 26 January 1985.

He was listed at \u00a340,000 with initial interest from Leeds in either a purchase or a short-term loan agreement (such as Leigh had agreed for James Leuluai the year before) and then further talk of him possibly returning from New Zealand to play for Salford in a swap deal for Paul Fletcher (who did subsequently join Hull F.C.) In the end it all came to nothing and Kemble's next return to Hull was 20 years later (alongside Dane, Fred, James and Australians Peter Sterling and John Muggleton) to reunite the 1985 challenge cup squad at a 21st anniversary dinner at Hull FC's KC stadium. After 5 great seasons with Hull FC, Gary Kemble therefore returned home to New Zealand subsequently establishing a successful coaching career."]}, {"page": "1999 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["|RB ||2||Lee Crooks || || "]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Lee Crooks||||2004\u20132006||47||1||"]}, {"page": "Dane O'Hara", "response": ["Amongst his many outstanding performances, Dane O'Hara played , i.e. number 2 (Clive Sullivan played in the replay), and scored a try in Hull FC's 14-14 draw with Widnes in the 1982 Challenge Cup Final during the 1981\u201382 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 1 May 1982, in front of a crowd of 92,147, he was ruled out of Hull's 18\u20139 win in the replay at Elland Road through injury.
