Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary focus of our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence."]}, {"page": "Grover Cleveland", "response": ["The Clevelands had five children: Ruth (1891\u20131904), Esther (1893\u20131980), Marion (1895\u20131977), Richard (1897\u20131974), and Francis (1903\u20131995).

O. Thomas, Obedience to Conscience, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, New Series, Vol. 64 (1963 - 1964), pp. 243-258. There has been a significant revival of virtue ethics in the past half-century, through the work of such philosophers as G.\u00a0E.\u00a0M. Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Alasdair Macintyre, Mortimer J. Adler, Jacques Maritain, Yves Simon, and Rosalind Hursthouse.", " The British ethicist Philippa Foot elaborates that morality does not seem to have any special binding force, and she clarifies that people only behave morally when motivated by other factors. Foot says \"People talk, for instance, about the 'binding force' of morality, but it is not clear what this means if not that we feel ourselves unable to escape.\" The idea is that, faced with an opportunity to steal a book because we can get away with it, moral obligation itself has no power to stop us unless we feel an obligation. Morality may therefore have no binding force beyond regular human motivations, and people must be motivated to behave morally. The question then arises: what role does reason play in motivating moral behaviour?"]}]}}
