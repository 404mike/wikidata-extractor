In 1719, he set up a 'pugilistic foundation' and charged himself as 'a professional in the Noble Science of Defense' to instruct boxers on the utilization of clench hands, sword, and quarterstaff.

Caunt was the Uncle of Langham's wife, and it is odd he would seek to fight his own mentor and business manager.   What prompted Langham to come out of boxing retirement may have been a family dispute between each boxer's wife, for which he wished to settle the score.
