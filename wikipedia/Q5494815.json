This remains the highest number of goals scored by a Gillingham player in a professional match, but was a rare high point in a season which saw Gillingham forced to apply for re-election to the league.  The following year the club abandoned its traditional black and white striped shirts in favour of blue shirts and white shorts, colours which have remained associated with Gillingham ever since, although the black and white stripes are still visible in the current version of the club's badge.  In 1932\u201333 former Crystal Palace manager Fred Maven led the club to its highest league finish to date, finishing the season in 7th place, but it was a feat which could not be repeated and the team returned to struggling at the foot of the table the following season."]}, {"page": "List of Gillingham F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Most goals in a Football League match: 6, Fred Cheesmur (against Merthyr Town, 26 April 1930).Triggs (2001), p349"]}, {"page": "List of people from Folkestone", "response": ["*Fred Cheesmur (1908\u20131987) association footballer"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["On 20 February, Asaba scored Gillingham's goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Colchester United but was then sent off for apparently head-butting Colchester's David Greene.  Two weeks later, however, the red card was overturned by a special commission convened by the Football Association, the sport's governing body in England, based on evidence provided by police officers present at the game. In the final game of February, Gillingham recorded their best ever Football League win away from home when they beat Burnley 5\u20130 at Turf Moor; Taylor scored all five goals.  It was the first time that a Gillingham player had scored as many goals in a single match since Fred Cheesmur scored six against Merthyr Town in 1930.  In the following match, Taylor scored in the final minute to gain the team a draw against fellow promotion contenders Preston North End.   "]}]}}
