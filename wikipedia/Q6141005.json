This expedition consisted of two voyages and was sent as a relief ship for Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery expedition. During the first voyage the ship was briefly stalled in the ice between Cape Bird and Beaufort Island. Paton took the opportunity to leave ship and jump floes a distance of one mile to 'land' of Beaufort Island, the first man to do so. This accomplishment was received with a reprimand.In 1907\u20131909, he was a crew member of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod expedition during each of Nimrod's two southern voyages. From 1910 to 1913, he was a seaman aboard Captain Scott's Terra Nova during her two voyages between New Zealand and Cape Evans, in support of Scott's ill-fated expedition. In 1914 he joined the Ross Sea party section of Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition as boatswain on SY Aurora. He was aboard ship on 7 May 1915 when Aurora was torn from her Cape Evans moorings, drifting in the pack for nine months before limping back to New Zealand. Paton's last Antarctic voyage was with Aurora on the mission to relieve the stranded Ross Sea party in January 1917.\nAfter Aurora's return to New Zealand she was sold, and became a coal carrier. Paton signed on as her boatswain, and was aboard when she left Newcastle, New South Wales, in June 1917, bound for South America. Her fate is uncertain, but in late 1917 or early 1918 she was lost, and Paton was lost with her. An inquiry established that the German raider Wolf was laying mines in Cook Strait and in the Tasman Sea in June and July 1917 and concluded that the Aurora likely ran afoul a mine.Paton's Antarctic voyages are commemorated by Paton Peak on Beaufort Island in the Ross Sea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ross Sea party", "response": ["The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea.

After leaving Newcastle, New South Wales on 20\u00a0June 1917, Aurora disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. On 2\u00a0January 1918, she was listed as missing by Lloyd's of London and presumed lost, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain.Tyler-Lewis, p. 274. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War.

Scott's ship had been frozen in the ice for two years, and had needed two rescue ships and several explosive charges to release her. Shackleton was determined to avoid this, and had given Mackintosh  instructions, relayed to Stenhouse, to winter Aurora north of the Tongue.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 114\u201316 No ship had previously wintered in the exposed northern section of the Sound, and the wisdom of doing this was questioned by the experienced seamen Ernest Joyce and James Paton in their private journals.Tyler-Lewis, p. 68Tyler-Lewis, pp. 120\u201321 and p.126 After the expedition was over, John King Davis, who was to lead the Ross Sea party relief mission, wrote that Shackleton's instruction should have been ignored and that Stenhouse should have taken Aurora to the safety of Hut Point, even at the risk of becoming frozen in.Tyler-Lewis, p. 221", "On 10 January 1917, manned by an almost entirely new crew, Aurora arrived at Cape Evans and picked up the seven survivors of the Ross Sea shore party; Mackintosh, Victor Hayward and Arnold Spencer-Smith had all died.Shackleton, pp. 335\u201337 This was the vessel's final visit to Antarctic waters; on return to New Zealand it was sold by Shackleton to a coal carrier.
