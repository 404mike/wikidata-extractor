Although Van Gogh never boarded with him, Pissarro did explain to him the various ways of finding and expressing light and color, ideas which he later used in his paintings, notes Lucien.", "Lucien Pissarro was taught painting by his father, and described him as a \"splendid teacher, never imposing his personality on his pupil.\"  Gauguin, who also studied under him, referred to Pissarro \"as a force with which future artists would have to reckon\".
