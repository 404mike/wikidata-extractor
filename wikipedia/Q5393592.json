He was born at Keynsham, Somerset and died at Bower Ashton, also in Somerset.\nMurdock was a right-handed lower-order batsman. In his two first-class matches for Somerset in 1885, he kept wicket at the time when Somerset was struggling to raise a full side; his highest first-class score of 14 was made in the first of these two matches, against Surrey at The Oval. Somerset lost its first-class status after the 1885 season and Murdock played some matches for the team in non-first-class cricket up to 1888. In 1889, however, he switched allegiance to Gloucestershire, where he appeared in three games in the season, achieving little with the bat, not keeping wicket, but bowling a little and taking the solitary first-class wicket of his career in his final first-class match.He was also involved in football; as a player he was a member of Bedminster F.C., and in 1913 was appointed chairman of Bristol City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Ernest Murdock (1885) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Morale was low at Somerset, and the county could not raise a full team to face Hampshire at Southampton a week later. They travelled with nine players, among their number Farrant Reed, who played eight first-class matches in his life, Ernest Murdock, who played five, Egerton Hall, three, and Edward Spurway, two. Somerset scored 117 runs in their first innings, of which Sainsbury contributed nine. The bowling of Bastard, who took eight for 59, helped to restrict Hampshire to 162. Despite their low numbers, Somerset reached 166 in their second innings, Sainsbury scoring ten from number five in the batting order. With Bastard unable to replicate his first innings performance, Hampshire reached the winning total of 123 from 60.3 overs. Somerset played Surrey and Gloucestershire in their final two matches of the season and lost both heavily, although they did succeed in avoiding any further record defeats; Surrey won by an innings and five runs, and Gloucestershire by nine wickets. Sainsbury's highest score in his four innings was 14. In the six matches that he played that season, all for Somerset, Sainsbury scored 119\u00a0runs at an average of 9.91, a marginal improvement on his previous season."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Ernest Murdock\u00a0 "]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Ernest Murdock (1889) : E.
