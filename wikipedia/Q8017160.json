Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, Robert Scott Lauder, William Quiller Orchardson and John Pettie. In the twentieth century the move away from figurative painting to impressionism and abstraction, speeded the decline of portrait painting. Artists who continued to pursue portraiture included Francis Cadell, Cecile Walton, Dorothy Johnstone and James Cowie. The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation. Alexander Moffat was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s. The artists associated with Moffat known as the \"new Glasgow Boys\" included Steven Campbell, Peter Howson, Ken Currie and Adrian Wisniewski. A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included Caroline McNairn, Robert MacLaurin and Gwen Hardie.", "From the mid-nineteenth century portrait painting declined as an art. This was partly due to the advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease.P. Allara, Pictures of People: Alice Neels American Portrait Gallery (UPNE, 2000), , p. 15. While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced.Arts Council of Great Britain.

David Octavius Hill (1802\u201370) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of Great Disruption of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of Hill & Adamson he was one of the founding fathers of art photography.H. Gernsheim, Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839\u20131960 (Courier Dover, 1962), , p. 34. Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847). Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803\u201369), William Quiller Orchardson (1832\u20131910) and John Pettie (1839\u201393). John Zephaniah Bell (1794\u20131883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century. The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the Glasgow Boys, mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention. A number of artists identified with the group came to support themselves through portrait painting, including James Guthrie (1859\u20131930) and Belfast-born John Lavery (1856\u20131944).S.
