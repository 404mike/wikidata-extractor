He was head gardener at the South Perth Zoological Gardens (now Perth Zoo) for many years, but was retrenched in the late 1920s with the onset of the Great Depression. Thereafter he spent his time collecting seeds and specimens of native plants. He made a number of collecting expeditions, including one east to Kalgoorlie with Ivan Carnaby; another south as far as Ravensthorpe, also with Carnaby; and one along the west coast from Bunbury to Geraldton. He collected the type specimens for a number of Eucalyptus taxa, including E. crucis (Silver Mallee), E. erythandra (Rosebud Gum), E. rhodantha (Rose Mallee) and E. steedmanii (Steedman's Gum). He was joint publisher with Joyce Blakely of the second and third of these species, and also E. burdettiana (Burdett Gum), E. carnabyi and E. chrysantha. E. steedmanii was named in his honour, as was Acacia steedmanii and Melaleuca fulgens subsp. steedmanii.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eucalyptus gomphocephala", "response": ["In 1939, William Blakely and Henry Steedman described two varieties of this species in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium but the named are listed as synonyms by the Australian Plant Census."]}, {"page": "Steedman", "response": ["*Henry Steedman (1866\u20131953), Scottish-born Australian botanist"]}, {"page": "H.Steedman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Steedman"]}, {"page": "Ivan Carnaby", "response": ["Ivan Clarence Carnaby (24 July 1908 \u2013 1974) was an Australian farmer, naturalist and ornithologist.

He also made several botanical collecting journeys with Henry Steedman.
