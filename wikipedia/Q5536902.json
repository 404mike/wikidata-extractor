He was mainly associated with Kent County Cricket Club, and made either 169 or 170 known appearances in first-class matches.Bennett was born in Shorne Ridgeway near Gravesend, Kent where he was employed as a bricklayer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm slow roundarm bowler and played in 126 for Kent. He played for several of the representative travelling teams including the United All-England Eleven (1860\u20131862); All-England Eleven (1864) and the United South of England Eleven (1872).  He represented the Players in 1865 and 1866.  He took part in the first English tour of Australia as a member of HH Stephenson's XI in Australia in 1861\u201362.The team travelled to Australia on the SS Great Britain. During the voyage the team practised on deck leading to one passenger receiving a broken nose and cut cheek when he was struck in the face by a belaying pin which George was using as an improvised cricket bat.  This incident is recorded in \u2018The Cabinet\u2019, the newspaper some passengers wrote during the voyage.  He was described by Lord Harris in 1907 in the History of Kent County Cricket as \"one of the best all rounders Kent has produced\".He was the first player to be ever given out handled the ball. In a match for Kent against Sussex at County Cricket Ground, Hove in August 1872, he removed a ball from his clothing before he had scored a run.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Handled the ball", "response": ["As a method of dismissal, handling the ball was included in the Laws of Cricket from the original code, written in 1744. In that document, it stated that \"If ye Striker touches or takes up ye Ball before she is lain quite still, unless asked by ye Bowler or Wicket Keeper, its out.\" Similar wording remained in the revision made to the laws thirty years later. The first batsman to be dismissed for handling the ball in first-class cricket was James Grundy, who suffered the fate while playing for the MCC against Kent in 1857. Prior to 1899, a batsman could be given out for handling the ball even if they were doing so to remove a ball which had got stuck in their equipment or clothing. At the time, if one of the fielders removed the ball from the batsman's clothing, they could claim a catch.Brodribb (1995), p. 229. It was in such a situation that George Bennett, the first player to be given out handled the ball in English county cricket, was dismissed in 1872. The wicket of William Scotton in early 1887 was described by Gerald Brodribb as \"most unusual\". In a match between the smokers and the non-smokers involved in the 1886\u201387 Ashes series, Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest. Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high-scoring match, he defended the delivery and picked the ball up. The fielders\u2014who also wanted the souvenir\u2014appealed, and Scotton was ruled out."]}, {"page": "Farmer (disambiguation)", "response": ["* George Bennett (cricketer, born 1829) (1829\u20131886), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket (1816\u20131863)", "response": ["H.
