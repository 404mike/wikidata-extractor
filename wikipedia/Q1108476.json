Equally adept in drama or comedy, she was described as the \"Judy Davis of her generation (or funnily enough, the green eyed American actor Meg Ryan)\" In 1992, Ben Elton cast her as the lead role of \"Rachel\", the feisty environmentalist, in the television adaptation of his hit novel Stark. The mini-series was a BBC/ABC comedy, was directed by Nadia Tass and co-starred Ben Elton and Colin Friels. McKenzie received an Australian Film Institute Award nomination for Best Actress in a Miniseries for the role. The same year (1993), she scored a Best Actress in a Feature Film nomination for her comedic turn in the indie comedy, This Won't Hurt a Bit, playing Vanessa Presscott, a nerdy English ing\u00e9nue with a speech impediment.

It was for playing the young lover Kate, opposite John Lynch's Harry in the Michael Rymer\u2013helmed drama Angel Baby, that McKenzie received international acclaim: The LA Weekly reviewed: \"McKenzie is a find. Whether using answers on the Wheel of Fortune as a kind of daily horoscope, or cringing in terror as the upright legs of chairs in an empty restaurant seem to whisper at her, she is blazingly equal to the extremes of animal panic and hyperconscious insight that are the north and south of this movie's humane compass.\" Angel Baby also featured actress Deborra-Lee Furness and Colin Friels.
