Playing for the Surrey club East Molesey for the earlier part of his career, he was a right-handed batsman and leg break bowler. Constable had a long first-class career, playing from 1939 until 1964. This period took in Surrey's seven successive County Championship wins from 1952 to 1958, to which he made a valuable contribution.\nHe scored 18849 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 30.45, including 27 centuries. In his 434 matches for Surrey his highest innings was 205 not out against Somerset at The Oval in 1952. The double century was particularly memorable as it took only 5 hours. Small in stature, Constable was a fine cutter of the ball. He batted up and down the order as the needs of the team demanded. He was a useful leg spinner early in his career becoming an occasional change later on.\nMicky Stewart said of him: \"He knew the game inside out and every first-class player inside out. I learned more about cricket from Bernie Constable than from anyone else.\"  His brother, Dennis, was also a first-class cricketer.", "link_mentions": {}}}
