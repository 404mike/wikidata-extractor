Playing for the Surrey club East Molesey for the earlier part of his career, he was a right-handed batsman and leg break bowler. Constable had a long first-class career, playing from 1939 until 1964. This period took in Surrey's seven successive County Championship wins from 1952 to 1958, to which he made a valuable contribution.\nHe scored 18849 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 30.45, including 27 centuries. In his 434 matches for Surrey his highest innings was 205 not out against Somerset at The Oval in 1952. The double century was particularly memorable as it took only 5 hours. Small in stature, Constable was a fine cutter of the ball. He batted up and down the order as the needs of the team demanded. He was a useful leg spinner early in his career becoming an occasional change later on.\nMicky Stewart said of him: \"He knew the game inside out and every first-class player inside out. I learned more about cricket from Bernie Constable than from anyone else.\"  His brother, Dennis, was also a first-class cricketer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill Alley", "response": ["Alley's 10 centuries for Somerset in 1961 remained a county record for thirty years. In 1962 he received the honour of being one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year, based on his performances in 1961 and during his career. In the 1962 season, he made over 1,900 runs and took 112 wickets. It was in 1962 that he got his best bowling return of 8 for 65 against a strong Surrey side, that included Ken Barrington, Peter May and Bernie Constable."]}, {"page": "Molesey", "response": ["*Bernie Constable (1921\u20131997), cricketer, brother of the below"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Surrey showed improvements on 1946 but Playfair remarked on \"the need for new blood\". Having said that, the arrival of Jim Laker certainly resolved any problems in spin bowling and his future partner Tony Lock was already making progress at second eleven level. Another good start was made by opening batsman David Fletcher who was awarded his county cap with Laker and Eric Bedser. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain Errol Holmes, Tom Barling, John Parker and Stan Squires. Laurie Fishlock had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper Arthur McIntyre played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and the retiring Alf Gover, who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer Eddie Watts could make only a few appearances due to injury. Geoffrey Whittaker made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays Bernie Constable and Stuart Surridge also played.Playfair, pp. 92\u201394.", "To decide the championship, a challenge match took place at The Oval on 4 to 6 September and Yorkshire II defeated Surrey II by 111 runs.Playfair, p. 127.
