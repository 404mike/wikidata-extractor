A journeyman of lower league English football, he had 21 separate spells at 19 different clubs within the space of just 12 years. A latecomer to the professional game, he found a Football League club at age 22, and was a regular first-team player for the first time at age 23.\nBeginning his career as a Millwall reserve following an impressive spell at non-League Edgware Town, in 2002 he joined Brentford. He was unimpressive however and moved on to Southend United the following year, where he proved to be a goal-ever-other-game revelation. In 2004, he enjoyed a short spell with Peterborough United before Torquay United broke their club record in signing him. Again he disappointed, and in 2005 moved on to Port Vale. With Vale he was once more prolific, scoring 32 goals in 72 league games. In 2007 Leeds United were persuaded to sign him, though he fared poorly before transferring to Northampton Town the following year. He spent the 2009\u201310 season at Hereford United, followed by a spell with York City. He left York in 2011 for brief spells at Braintree Town, Lewes, Tooting & Mitcham United, Boston United, Arlesey Town, Brimsdown and then Enfield Borough. In addition to all of these clubs he has also had loan spells with Leyton Orient, Partick Thistle, Torquay United, Oldham Athletic, and Cheltenham Town over the years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1978", "response": ["** Leon Constantine, British footballer"]}, {"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["* Leon Constantine from Peterborough United for \u00a375,000 in December 2004 (current club record)"]}, {"page": "Southend United F.C.", "response": ["|2003\u201304||Leon Constantine||40||3||21"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in English football", "response": ["| August || Alex FergusonManchester United Premier League.com.

Foyle took over first team responsibilities at the club on 13 February 2004 after Brian Horton left by mutual consent, and the team narrowly missed out on a play-off place on goal difference at the end of the 2003\u201304 season. Following the end of the season, Foyle aimed to keep players at the club, but eventually lost top scorer Stephen McPhee and midfielder Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. The club also had to make massive cut backs due to having just come out of administration and when Steve Brooker (a player signed by Horton on Foyle's recommendation) was sold to Bristol City any chance of a play-off push was unlikely. Vale eventually finished 17th in a frustrating season where many players suffered injuries leaving the squad threadbare on more than one occasion. The next two seasons saw an increase in the playing budget as Vale got their house in order after administration and Foyle steered the side to 13th and 12th-place finishes in League One.

In November, Sam Togwell joined on loan from Scunthorpe United, in an initial six week deal that was extended until the end of the season. Another long-term loan deal was struck with Leyton Orient for big defender Clayton Fortune, who would later turn down a permanent transfer to Vale Park after failing to agree on personal terms. Foyle also made possibly the best signing of his spell in charge at Vale, bringing striker Leon Constantine in from Torquay United for a \u00a320,000 fee.
