Lower estimates do not include those killed in all Axis-controlled countries. A detailed study by Sybil Milton, formerly senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum gave a figure of at least a minimum of 220,000, possibly closer to 500,000.

Hancock chose the term, coined by a Kalderash Rom, from a number of suggestions in an \"informal conversation in 1993\".", " Ian Hancock dismisses this word, arguing that it does not conform to Romani language morphology. Some Ruska Roma activists offer to use the term Kali Tra\u0161 (\"Black Fear\"). Another alternative that has been used is Ber\u0161a Bibahtale (\"The Unhappy Years\").

Roma in the Slovak Republic were killed by local collaborating auxiliaries. Notably, in Denmark and Greece, local populations did not participate in the hunt for Roma as they did elsewhere.Ian Hancock said there was no record of any Roma killed in Denmark or Greece. Source:  Bulgaria and Finland, although allies of Germany, did not cooperate with the Porajmos, just as they did not cooperate with the Jewish Shoah.", "However new findings and documents uncovered by research experts revealed that the Roma death toll was at least about 200,000 to 500,000 of the 1 or 2 million Roma in Europe, although there are numerous experts and scholars who give much higher number of Romani deaths, such as Ian Hancock, director of the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, in his findings discovered that almost the entire Romani population was killed in Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Rudolph Rummel, the late professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii who spent his career assembling data on collective violence by governments toward their people (for which he coined the term democide), estimated that 258,000 must have been killed in Europe, 36,000 in Romania under Ion Antonescu and 27,000 in Usta\u0161e-controlled Croatia.", "In a 2010 publication, Ian Hancock stated that he agrees with the view that the number of Romanies killed has been underestimated as a result of being grouped with others in Nazi records under headings such as \"remainder to be liquidated\", \"hangers-on\", and \"partisans\".  He notes recent evidence such as the previously obscure Lety concentration camp in the Czech Republic and Ackovic's revised estimatesEssay \"The Suffering of the Roma in Jasenovac\" in  of Romani killed by the Usta\u0161e as high as 80,000\u2013100,000. These numbers suggest that previous estimates have been grossly underrepresented.", "Ian Hancock has also observed a reluctance among Roma to acknowledge their victimization by the Third Reich.  The Roma \"are traditionally not disposed to keeping alive the terrible memories from their history\u2014nostalgia is a luxury for others\".  The effects of the illiteracy, the lack of social institutions, and the rampant discrimination faced by Roma in Europe today have produced a people who, according to Fortuna, lack a \"national consciousness\u00a0... and historical memory of the Holocaust because there is no Roma elite.\""]}, {"page": "Persecution", "response": ["The Porajmos was the planned and attempted effort, often described as a genocide, during World War II by the government of Nazi Germany and its allies to exterminate the Romani (Gypsy) people of Europe. Under the rule of Adolf Hitler, a supplementary decree to the Nuremberg Laws was issued on 26 November 1935, defining Gypsies as \"enemies of the race-based state\", the same category as Jews. Thus, the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews. Historians estimate that 220,000 to 500,000 Romani were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators, or more than 25% of the slightly less than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time.
