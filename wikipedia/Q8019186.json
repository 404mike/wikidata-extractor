Two of his most important patrons were Josiah Wedgwood, credited with the industrialization of the manufacture of pottery, and Richard Arkwright, regarded as the creator of the factory system in the cotton industry. One of Wright's students, William Tate, was uncle to the eccentric gentleman tunneller, Joseph Williamson, and completed some of Wright's works after his death. Wright also had connections with Erasmus Darwin and other members of the Lunar Society, which brought together leading industrialists, scientists, and philosophers. Although meetings were held in or near Birmingham, Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, lived in Derby, and some of the paintings by Wright, which are notable for their use of brilliant light on shade, are of, or were inspired by, Lunar Society gatherings."]}, {"page": "William Tate", "response": ["William Tate may refer to:", "*William Tate (MP) (1559\u20131617), English politician", "*William Tate (painter) (1747\u20131806), English portrait painter", "*William Tate (soldier), Irish-American colonel in the French Revolutionary Wars", "*William Tate (baseball), American baseball player", "*William Tate (academic) (1903\u20131980), Dean at the University of Georgia", "*William Tate (lighthouse keeper), lighthouse keeper and aviation pioneer", "*William Tate (priest) (died 1540), Canon of Windsor", "*William Tate (bowls), Irish lawn bowler", "*William Tate, Jr., a character in the TV series Believe"]}]}}
