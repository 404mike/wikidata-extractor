November 1763 \u2013 24 April 1824) was a British Tory politician. He sat in the House of Commons for three periods between 1803 and 1824.\nSwann was elected at a by-election in September 1803 as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight.\nHowever he resigned his seat early in 1804, through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds.He returned to the Commons two years later, when he was elected at the 1806 general election for the borough of Penryn in Cornwall.\nHe was re-elected in 1807,1812,\nand 1818,\nbut his 1818 victory was declared void after an election petition was lodged. The seat remained vacant until the 1820 general election, when he was returned again,\nholding the seat until his death in 1824.On Friday, 11 October 1811, Henry Swann officiated at the laying of the first stone for the new Waterloo Bridge over the Thames River in London. The bridge was to be constructed of grey granite which was to be quarried near Penryn, Corwall, Swann's constituency. A bottle of coins from the reign of the current king, George III, was placed inside that first stone.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swann", "response": ["*Henry Swann (1763\u20131824), British Tory politician, Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Henry Swann"]}, {"page": "Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"5\"| Henry Swann", "| vacant Henry Swann was re-elected in 1818, but his election was voided on petition.

While his father's seat in the House of Lords protected him from prosecution for debt, Perceval was not so fortunate, and was often forced to leave the country to escape writs. He developed dissipated habits early in life, and became an alcoholic. Perhaps to escape this wandering life, he began to seek a seat in Parliament (which would protect him from duns) in 1824, announcing he would stand for Penryn, where Henry Swann had fallen ill. However, he begun his canvass too late to effectively compete for the vacancy and did not go to the poll. In March 1826, when George Watson-Taylor retired to take another seat, he was put in at East Looe on the interest of James Drummond Buller-Elphinstone. It is not clear that he ever took his seat; in April, his family's Irish agent and solicitor, Edward Tierney, was writing to him to beg him to \"abandon his evil courses and his associates\". He contested Penryn at the 1826 election, but was served with a writ, probably for debt, during the canvass and was defeated, lacking the means to make headway with a venal electorate."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Penryn(two members)||Henry Swann||Tory", "| 10 May 1824 || Penryn || Henry Swann || Tory || Robert Stanton || Tory || Swann died on 24 April 1824"]}, {"page": "Ufford Hall, Cambridgeshire", "response": ["It was bought by William Leigh Symes, owner of the Oxford estate, a sugar plantation in Jamaica, and, in 1797, inherited by his son, Robert.
