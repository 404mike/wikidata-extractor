During this time his home and business were attacked several times, and his wife survived a gunshot to the head in 1972.  His time in office coincided with the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and he was therefore the first Lord Mayor since John White in 1920 not to serve as an ex officio member of the Senate.In the 1973 elections to Belfast City Council Christie stood in the north-west Belfast 'E' division (equivalent to the current wards of Legoniel, Ballysillan, Ardoyne, Woodvale, Forthriver and Ballygomartin), which elected 6 councillors.  He was the only UUP candidate to stand in E and gained 7,875 votes, which equated to 2.8 times the electoral quota.  He retired in 1977, and the UUP vote dropped more than 3000 votes.  Amongst two UUP councillors elected to replace him was future Lord Mayor Billy Bell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Christie", "response": ["William Christie may refer to:", "* William Christie (Unitarian) (1748\u20131823), Scottish Unitarian writer", "* William Christie (dean of Moray, Ross and Caithness) (1816\u20131885), Scots Episcopal priest and first dean of the United Diocese", "* William Christie (Conservative politician) (1830\u20131913), British Member of Parliament for Lewes, 1874\u20131885", "* William Christie (astronomer) (1845\u20131922), British astronomer", "* William Christie (dean of Brechin) (fl. 1882\u20131931), Scots Episcopal priest and son of the above Dean of Moray", "* William Christie (Ulster politician) (1913\u20132008), British politician", "* William Christie (musician) (born 1944), American conductor and harpsichordist"]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Belfast", "response": ["|Sir William Christie"]}, {"page": "Christie (surname)", "response": ["* William Christie (disambiguation), multiple people, including:", "** William Christie (musician) (born 1944), American musician", "** William Christie (astronomer) (1845\u20131922), English astronomer", "** William Christie (Ulster politician) (1913\u20132008), Irish politician", "** William Christie (Missionary) (1870-04-28 1955-01-11), In 1888 immigrated from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland to New York City, USA.
