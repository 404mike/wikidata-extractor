Despite raising over \u00a37m in transfers, the club could no longer attract such quality of player to the club for affordable fees and only Seth Johnson and Esteban Fuertes were signed, the former for a club record \u00a33m. The club paid the price, earning only 3 wins from their first 17 fixtures. In a desperate attempt to stave off relegation, the club signed Craig Burley, Branko Strupar and Lee Morris for a combined \u00a38m in November 1999 (Georgi Kinkladze was also signed on loan from AFC Ajax before signing for \u00a33m in the close season) and rallied to only lose 6 of their final 18 games, although they won only 5, to avoid relegation by 5 points, recording a 16th-placed finish. Strupar in particular adapted well to English football after arriving from Genk, netting 5 goals in 13 starts including the first Premier League goal of the new 2000 millennium with a 3rd-minute strike in a 2\u20130 win over Watford. Other notable results, such as a 3\u20131 win over Chelsea, a 4\u20131 win away at Middlesbrough and a 4\u20134 draw with Bradford City showed the club was still competitive and fans still attended in large numbers; 33,378 attending a 2\u20130 home defeat by Liverpool setting a new record for a Derby match at Pride Park. All this was temporarily overshadowed by controversy surrounding the signing of Fuertes who, after scoring twice, including the winner against Everton, was refused entry back into Britain after a club training break in Portugal when immigration officials discovered that his Italian passport was forged; Derby were able to recoup his fee by transferring him to French side Lens for \u00a32.8m."]}, {"page": "2007 Football League One play-off Final", "response": ["Yeovil Town's opponents for their play-off semi-final were Nottingham Forest with the first match of the two-legged tie taking place at Huish Park in Yeovil on 11 May 2007.
