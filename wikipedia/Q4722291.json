Twelve local burghers stepped forward guided by Alfred Barker a former league referee and supporter of the club. A new board of seven directors was formed and in June 1908 re-branded the club as Stoke Football Club (1908). Barker's impressive efforts led to Stoke being included for re-election but lost out Tottenham Hotspur and their exit from the Football League was confirmed. Barker placed Stoke in the Birmingham & District League for the 1908\u201309 season."]}]}}
