She is known for her large-scale painted depictions of nude women. Saville has been credited with originating a new and challenging method of painting the female nude and reinventing figure painting for contemporary art. Saville works and lives in Oxford, England.On 5 October 2018 Saville's Propped (1992) sold at Sothebys' in London for \u00a39.5 million, above its \u00a33-\u00a34 million estimate, becoming the most expensive work by a living female artist sold at auction.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ashmolean Museum", "response": ["* Drawing in Venice: Titian to Canaletto: Open from October 2015 until January 2016, this exhibition featured a hundred drawings from The Uffizi Gallery in Florence, the Ashmolean, and Christ Church, Oxford.

Individuals such as Sarah Lucas, Jenny Saville and Rachel Whiteread have varied levels of neglect within their media portrayals, as well as incomparable in notoriety to male YBA peers such as Hirst.", "With the prevalence of feminist ideology in society and the contemporary art, critics have argued that female artists like Jenny Saville in the 1990s investigated the contrived idea of 'feminity' made by the Patriarchal Structure. While attending art school in Cincinnati, Saville's feminist passion was conceived through a realisation of gender within art history. In her own words, she discovered that, \"I'd always wondered why there had been no women artists in history. I found there had been \u2013 but not reported. I realized I'd been affected by male ideas, going through a male-dominated art college\". Now consciously aware of institutional patriarchy, Saville began to paint female nudes that weren't idealised. Rather than continue the recognised historical male view of female bodies, Saville created depictions of natural women with genuine flaws. Pubic hair trailing up stomachs and around thighs, discoloured skin and areas of excess flesh. Deconstructing the feminine body, Saville has stated that, \"I'm not trying to teach, just make people discuss, look at how women have been made by man. What is beauty? Beauty is usually the male image of the female body. My women are beautiful in their individuality.\"", "* Jenny Saville"]}, {"page": "Timeline of art", "response": ["* 1970 in art \u2013 Birth of Jenny Saville, Death of Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Eva Hesse, Fritz Ascher"]}, {"page": "Saatchi Gallery", "response": ["Saatchi's promotion of these artists dominated local art throughout the nineties and brought them to worldwide notice.
