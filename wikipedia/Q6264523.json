With roots in the 16th century, British Israelism was inspired by several 19th century English writings such as John Wilson's 1840 Our Israelitish Origin. Numerous British Israelite organisations were set up throughout the British Empire as well as in the United States from the 1870s onwards; a number of these organisations are independently active as of the early 21st century. In America, the idea gave rise to the Christian Identity movement.", "Aspects of British Israelism and its influences have also been traced to Richard Brothers, who published A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times in 1794, John Wilson's Our Israelitish Origin (1844), and John Pym Yeatman's The Shemetic Origin of the Nations of Western Europe (1879).", "The key component of British Israelism is its representation of the migrations of the Lost Tribes of Israel. Adherents suggested that the Scythians, Cimmerians and Goths were representatives of these lost tribes, and the progenitors of the later invaders of Britain. John Wilson would argue for the inclusion of all Western European Gothic peoples among the descendants of the Israelites, but under the later influence of Edward Hine, the movement would come to view only the peoples of the British Isles as having this ancestry.", "Early British Israelites such as Edward Hine and John Wilson were philo-semites. British Israelism had several Jewish adherents and it also received support from rabbis throughout the 19th century. Within British politics, the movement supported Benjamin Disraeli, who was descended from Sephardi Jews,Life From The Dead, 1875, Vol. III, p. 154. while they also favoured Theodor Herzl's advocacy of Zionism.  Still, an anti-semitic strain existed below the surface, such as the scientific racialism which led Wilson to deny the 'racial purity' of modern-day Jews, leading some within the movement to adopt the belief that modern-day Jews were 'un-Semitic impostors.'  Some American adherents of British Israelism would later adopt a racialized, strongly anti-Semitic theology that became known as Christian Identity, which has at its core the belief that non-Caucasian people have no souls and therefore cannot be saved.  Since its emergence in the 1920s, Christian Identity has taught the belief that Jews are not descended from the tribe of Judah.  Instead, some Christian Identity adherents believe that Jews are descended from Satan and Lilith while others believe that Jews are descended from Edomite-Khazars (see Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry).  Their adoption of the British Israelist belief that the Israelite-derived Anglo-Saxons had been favoured by God over the 'impure' modern Jews meant that a reluctantly anti-Semitic Klansman \"could now maintain his anti-Semitism and at the same time revere a Bible cleansed of its Jewish taint.\"", "Some proponents of British Israelism have claimed that numerous links exist between historical linguistics and ancient Hebrew and various European place names and languages. This can be traced to the works of John Wilson in the 19th century. Wilson, who was self-trained, looked for similarities in the sounds of words and argued that many Scottish, British and Irish words stemmed from ancient Hebrew words. Wilson's publications inspired the development of British Israel language associations in Europe.", "* John Wilson (1799\u20131870) published a series of his lectures in a book, Our Israelitish Origin (1840)"]}, {"page": "Christian Identity", "response": ["The Christian Identity movement emerged in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot of British Israelism.

Hine took a more particularist view, deciding that only the British nation fulfilled the prophecy for Israel \u2014 he acknowledged an ethnic affiliation between Britons and Germans, but thought this reflected what he considered was a close relationship between the ancient Israelites and their neighbors the Assyrians (who had taken the Ten Lost Tribes into captivity in Assyria). Likewise, Britain and Germany's status as two great powers of the modern age he considered reflective of the ancient glories of the Kingdom of Israel and of Assyria. So there were two original competing views as to the relationship between the Germans and British-Israel; either the British people, alone, were identified with the Tribes of Israel (Edward Hine) or they included the Germans (John Wilson) and other European peoples (including the Dutch and Scandinavians).The Standard of Israel, 1876, Vol II, p. 100.
