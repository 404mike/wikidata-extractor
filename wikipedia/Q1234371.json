It treats of the incarnation of the Divine Logos, and its contents are in many cases identical with the Demonstratio evangelica. Only fragments are preserved in Greek, but a complete Syriac translation of the Theophania survives in an early 5th-century manuscript. Samuel Lee, the editor (1842) and translator (1843) of the Syriac Theophania, thought that the work must have been written \"after the general peace restored to the Church by Constantine, and before either the 'Praeparatio,' or the 'Demonstratio Evangelica,' was written ...It appears probable ... therefore, that this was one of the first productions of Eusebius, if not the first after the persecutions ceased.\"Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea On the Theophania, or Divine Manifestation of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (Cambridge, 1843), pp. xxi\u2013xxii. Lee's full passage is as follows: \"As to the period at which it was written, I think it must have been, after the general peace restored to the Church by Constantine, and before either the \"Praeparatio\", or the \"Demonstratio Evangelica\", was written. My reason for the first of these suppositions is: Our author speaks repeatedly of the peace restored to the Church; of Churches and Schools restored, or then built for the first time : of the nourishing state of the Church of Caesarea; of the extended, and then successfully extending, state of Christianity : all of which could not have been said during the times of the last, and most severe persecution. My reasons for the second of these suppositions are, the considerations that whatever portions of this Work are found, either in the \"Praeparatio\", |22 the \"Demonstratio Evangelica\", or the \" Oratio de laudibus Constantini\", they there occur in no regular sequence of argument as they do in this Work: especially in the latter, into which they have been carried evidently for the purpose of lengthening out a speech. Besides, many of these places are amplified in these works, particularly in the two former as remarked in my notes; which seems to suggest, that such additions were made either to accommodate these to the new soil, into which they had been so transplanted, or, to supply some new matter, which had suggested itself to our author. And again, as both the \"Praeparatio\" and \"Demonstratio Evangelica\", are works which must have required very considerable time to complete them, and which would even then be unfit for general circulation; it appears probable to me, that this more popular, and more useful work, was first composed and published, and that the other two,--illustrating as they generally do, some particular points only,--argued in order in our Work,-- were reserved for the reading and occasional writing of our author during a considerable number of years, as well for the satisfaction of his own mind, as for the general reading of the learned. It appears probable to me therefore, that this was one of the first productions of Eusebius, if not the first after the persecutions ceased.\" Hugo Gressmann, noting in 1904 that the Demonstratio seems to be mentioned at IV. 37 and V. 1, and that II. 14 seems to mention the extant practice of temple prostitution at Hieropolis in Phoenica, concluded that the Theophania was probably written shortly after 324. Others have suggested a date as late as 337.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius (Harvard, 1981), p. 367, n.176. Note that Lee (p. 285) thinks that the passage in V. 1 refers to an earlier section within the Theophania itself, rather than to the Demonstratio."]}, {"page": "Ibn Battuta", "response": ["Three copies of another abridged manuscript were acquired by the Swiss traveller Johann Burckhardt and bequeathed to the University of Cambridge.

This led to the establishment of their Christian mission in New Zealand, which saw laymen arriving from 1814 to teach building, farming and Christianity to M\u0101ori, as well as training 'native' ministers. The M\u0101ori language (Te Reo M\u0101ori) did not then have an indigenous writing system. Missionaries learned to speak M\u0101ori, and introduced the Latin alphabet. The CMS, including Thomas Kendall; M\u0101ori, including T\u012btore and  Hongi Hika; and Cambridge University's Samuel Lee, developed the written language between 1817 and 1830. In 1833, while living in the Paihia mission house of Anglican priest and the now head of the New Zealand CMS mission (later to become the New Zealand Church Missionary Society) Rev Henry Williams, missioner William Colenso published the Te Reo translations of books of the Bible, the first books printed in New Zealand. His 1837 M\u0101ori New Testament was the first indigenous language translation of the Bible published in the southern hemisphere. Demand for the Te Reo New Testament, and the Prayer Book that followed, grew exponentially, as did Christian M\u0101ori leadership and public Christian services, with 33,000 M\u0101ori soon attending regularly. Literacy and understanding the Bible increased mana and social and economic benefits, decreased slavery and intertribal violence, and increased peace and respect for all people in M\u0101ori society, including women."]}, {"page": "New Zealand literature", "response": ["Polynesian settlers began arriving in New Zealand in the late 13th or early 14th century, and became known as M\u0101ori developing a distinct culture, including oral myths, legends, poetry, songs (waiata), and prayers. Public speaking on the marae, a communal and sacred gathering place, was (and remains) a particularly important part of M\u0101ori culture, and performance was a key part of the oral tradition; for example, Maori women perform karanga (a ceremonial call) as part of the p\u014dwhiri (welcoming ceremony). M\u0101ori did not have a written language until the early 19th century, when chief Hongi Hika and his nephew Waikato worked with linguist Samuel Lee to develop a systematic written form of the language. As European settlers arrived, they collected many M\u0101ori oral stories and poems, which were translated into English and published, such as Polynesian Mythology (1855) by George Grey and Maori Fairy Tales (1908) by Johannes Andersen. These stories, such as those about the god M\u0101ui, became widely known among the non-M\u0101ori population of New Zealand as well as the M\u0101ori people.
