He was born in Markinch, Fife, and attended Madras College and the University of St Andrews before going to Trinity College, Cambridge. He later became a Fellow of the College and Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics at Cambridge University from 1875; he was also Lord Rector of St Andrews from 1898 to 1901. Stuart was interested in popularising scientific topics and published several books on the subject.\nStuart was an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the Cambridge University parliamentary seat in an 1882 by-election; in 1884 he was elected for Hackney. From the 1885 election he sat for the Hoxton division of Shoreditch. He became known for his contribution to London politics and in February 1890 was chosen as an Alderman of the London County Council; the added work caused him to resign his chair at Cambridge. The Progressive Party on the LCC chose him as its Leader shortly after his election but he stood down after the 1892 council election.\nIn the 1900 general election, Stuart lost his seat in Parliament. He returned briefly for Sunderland from 1906 until again being defeated in January 1910.  He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1909. Suffering poor health, he published his memoirs (Reminiscences) in 1912.\nHe married Laura, the eldest daughter of Jeremiah Colman (MP) and Caroline Colman. His sister in law Ethel Colman was the first female Lord Mayor of Norwich. He died in Carrow Abbey, Norwich on 12 October 1913. His wife and sisters in law's memorial to him was the 1915 erection of a block of 22 flats, to re-house some of those affected by the Norwich flood of 1912.

Although it was thought thirty students would sign up, three hundred joined. In 1868 Butler published \"The Education and Employment of Women\", her first pamphlet, in which she argued for access to higher education for women, and more equal access to a wider range of jobs. It was the first of 90 books and pamphlets she wrote.
