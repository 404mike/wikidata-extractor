A rose garden at the school may have inspired his early interest in them. He completed his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees at Rangoon University, with a study on Burmese Charophyta for his master's. He then went for his doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge under Rowland Biffen and later Frank Engledow, studying hybrid vigour in wheat. He then worked as a rice research officer in Burma in 1932 and then moved to Pusa in Bihar as a second economic botanist. He became an Imperial Economic Botanist at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in 1937. In 1936, the institute moved to New Delhi following an earthquake. He moved there and became the director of the institute in September 1950. He became the first director general of the newly reorganized Indian Council for Agricultural Research in 1965 and worked there until his retirement in 1972.

Biffen began studying cereal breeding in the early 1900s with the aim of producing improved varieties for farmers and millers, and also to test whether Mendel's laws applied to wheat. He demonstrated that resistance to yellow rust was a dominant trait and this culminated in 1910 in the release of the rust-resistant variety Little Joss, which was widely grown for decades and used as a parent for many other varieties."]}, {"page": "Little Joss", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rowland Biffen"]}, {"page": "Venkatrao K. Badami", "response": ["Badami was born in Mysore, the third and youngest son of Badami Krishna Rao (1851-1937; son of Rao Bahadur Lakshman Rao, he translated Robinson Crusoe into Kannada). An older brother, B.K. Badami, became a veterinarian in Hyderabad. Venkatrao studied at Bangalore and Mysore before going to the College of Agriculture at Coimbatore in 1909. He joined the Mysore Agriculture Department in July 1913 under Leslie C. Coleman as a junior assistant botanist, and later served as the assistant principal of the Hebbal agricultural school. He was deputed for doctoral studies in Cambridge under Sir Rowland Biffen. His PhD thesis in 1928 was on \"Inheritance studies in Arachis hypogaea (the groundnut).\" He travelled around Europe and met Herman Nilsson-Ehle in Sweden and Wilhelm Johannsen in Denmark. He also interacted with C.A. Barber, Reginald Punnett and  William Bateson and returned to India and was posted economic botanist in 1929, principal of the agricultural school in 1931, and deputy director of agriculture from 1934. He helped produce the HM 320 variety of sugarcane, conducted studies on selections, and bred many varieties of ragi and groundnut. After Coleman saw mutation breeding of tobacco at the Klaten Experimental Station in Java, Badami also undertook experiments on X-ray induced mutation of sugarcane. Various sugarcane mutants known as \"mys-ray\" were evaluated and some found to be useful. Similar experiments had failed elsewhere and Badami attributed his success to the use of seeds from homozygous sugarcane lines. He also examined the diversity of sandal trees. Sir John Russell, noted in his 1937 report on crop research in India that \"Dr Badami is an ingenious investigator with a flair for this type of work. So long as he remains in charge some valuable results may be expected.\" Badami later served as Deputy Director of Agriculture for Orissa (c. 1942) and as principal of the Institute of Agricultural Research at the Benares Hindu University (c. 1946-49)."]}, {"page": "Jane Ingham", "response": ["In February 1930, Ingham joined the Imperial Bureau of Plant and Crop Genetics, at the Plant Breeding Institute, Cambridge, as a translator and scientific officer. Sir Rowland Biffen was the first director of the Cambridge bureau, and her supervisor, Penrhyn Stanley Hudson , was deputy director. She was fluent in French, Italian, German and Swedish, and as a whole, the bureau had been capable of dealing with Spanish, Dutch, and Russian. Abstracts were written on various aspects of plant breeding and genetics, with some of the foreign language papers requiring more complete translations. These abstracts were published in a quarterly journal called Plant Breeding Abstracts. In 1931, she attended the eighth conference of the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) at Oxford, where progress on ASLIB's newlyformed panel of expert translators was discussed. After her marriage, she worked from home translating most of the German documents, and in 1939, was put in charge of the bureau after Hudson fell ill."]}]}}
