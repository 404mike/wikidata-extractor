Still, the government's position on smoking as a cause of lung cancer remained equivocal. In 1956 Joules established the first publicly funded clinic for smokers and in March 1957 Joules was again quoted in parliament by the Labour MP, Marcus Lipton, as saying 'that the health of our people is being sacrificed to the collection of \u00a3650 million annually from the tax on tobacco'. Eventually, following a special report on smoking and lung cancer in June 1957 by the Medical Research Council, the government conceded the issue, and the Minister of Health  expressed unambiguous support for the conclusions reached by Doll and Hill, while at the same time saying that everyone would have to 'make up his mind, and must be relied upon as a responsible person to act as seems best'. Joules followed this by speaking to more than 250 children at a Croydon school and screening a film which showed a surgeon conducting an operation in which a cancer of the lung was removed. Joules also continued his campaign in the press. In 1958 he called for an increased tax on smoking and in 1959 he was reported in the Times as saying that the government's inaction could only mean that: 'we have become a nation of tobacco addicts. I wonder if there is any other drug addiction that the world has ever known that has produced such a pathetic harvest of disease.' Joules worked closely with Laurie Pavitt after his election as Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament for Willesden West in 1959 to keep up the pressure on the government. Pavitt introduced 17 bills on the control of tobacco, none of which were successful. In 1962, the Royal College of Physicians issued its famous report on Smoking and Health, which is now seen as a key milestone in tobacco control, and health education in general. Following its election, in 1965 the new Labour government passed a law prohibiting cigarette advertising on television and the public health campaign against tobacco entered its modern phase, but by this time Joules had retired."]}]}}
