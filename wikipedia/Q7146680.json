Influence and activity moved north to the other centres (\"the drift north\"), a trend which continued for much of the following century.

At the same time people started to notice Dunedin's mellowing, the ageing of its grand old buildings, with writers like E. H. McCormick pointing out its atmospheric charm. In the 1930s and early 1940s a new generation of artists such as M. T.
