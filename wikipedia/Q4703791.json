Elaborating on what inspired the change, Ewing explained \"What inspired it\u2014a mixture of wanting someone big on or allied with the team\u2014originally, we thought about Odin, but he's a bit busy\u2014and my usual preoccupations with atonement, redemption, growth and change. So what can [Galactus] do now? Well, whereas before he was taking in vast amounts of energy, now he's putting out vast amounts of energy\u2014pure life energy.
