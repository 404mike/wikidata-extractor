Pablo Casals recorded the five cello sonatas in the 1930s, the Third with pianist . In 1950, the sonata was recorded, together with the second by Maurice Gendron and composer Jean Fran\u00e7aix as the pianist. A recording of all cello sonatas was made by Mstislav Rostropovich and Sviatoslav Richter in 1963, which has been regarded as one of the greatest collaborations ever. Pierre Fournier and Wilhelm Kempff recorded the works in 1965, followed by Casals and Mieczys\u0142aw Horszowski, Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 and Daniel Barenboim, Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott and Angela Hewitt, and Mischa Maisky and Martha Argerich. The five sonatas were recorded in 2014 by cellist  and pianist Per Lundberg. Steven Isserlis and the musicologist Robert Levin played the sonatas on historic instruments, with forte-piano instead of a modern concert grand, to ensure the balance of sound Beethoven had in mind. They used a new critical edition by the musicologist Jonathan Del Mar.
