She stood for the leadership of the SNP in 1990 but lost out to Alex Salmond despite the backing of many prominent SNP members (such as Jim Sillars). Ewing had become leader of the SNP's parliamentary group after the 1987 election. The leadership vacancy was caused by the fact that the SNP Chairman Gordon Wilson had lost his seat at Dundee Dundee East and previous group leader Donald Stewart had retired from parliament. While, the three SNP MPs elected in 1987 had not been members of the previous parliament, both Ewing and Andrew Welsh had served in parliament in the past. A post-election meeting held at Perth between Ewing, Welsh, Salmond (newly elected as MP for Banff and Buchan) and Wilson led to Ewing's appointment with Welsh becoming the group's chief whip."]}, {"page": "Billy Wolfe (politician)", "response": ["Wolfe was born in Bathgate, West Lothian, the son of Thomas Wolfe, owner of George Wolfe & Sons Ltd. and the Bathgate Forge Co.

Gordon Wilson, Wolfe, William Cuthbertson (1924\u20132010), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press He was educated at Bathgate Academy and George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and saw active service during World War II, serving with the Scottish Horse (Royal Artillery) from 1942 to 1947 in France, the Low Countries, Germany, Indonesia and Malaya. Following demobilization, he qualified as a chartered accountant in 1952, and was company secretary of the family firms from 1952 to 1964.", "It was during Wolfe's period as leader that the party had considerable electoral success in elections to the Westminster parliament, winning 30% of the vote in Scotland and 11 of the 71 Scottish seats in the October 1974 General Election, though Wolfe failed to win a seat of his own in West Lothian in the two general elections of that year, despite gaining an increased share of the vote. His exclusion from the powerful new group of SNP MPs caused some difficulties for his leadership of the party. However, following a difficult period which saw the passing of the Scotland Act 1978, a number of internal divisions in the SNP and the failure of the party to win in a series of by-elections, in 1978 Wolfe announced his intention to stand down as leader after almost ten tumultuous years in office. The resultant loss of influence led to his being sidelined as the SNP moved into the 1979 general election campaign, and a disastrous performance in which the SNP only managed to retain 2 of their 11 MPs. Wolfe was succeeded by Gordon Wilson at the SNP Annual National Conference in September 1979."]}, {"page": "Labour Party of Scotland", "response": ["William Wolfe, then leader of the SNP, dismissed the Labour Party of Scotland's founding as opportunism on the part of local politicians. These included George MacLean, the party's most popular member, whose by-election rival Gordon Wilson succeeded Wolfe in 1979.", "Unlike its Glaswegian counterpart, which exclusively contested elections to the Glasgow Corporation, Dundee's now larger party fought for a seat in the United Kingdom Parliament. The appointment of George Thomson as a European Commissioner in January 1973 saw him vacate his constituency of Dundee East, triggering a by-election two months later. The Labour Party of Scotland selected George MacLean to be its candidate, pitting him against Labour's George Machin, the SNP's Gordon Wilson and Conservative candidate William Fitzgerald, then Lord Provost of Dundee.  Nathaniel Gordon of the Liberal Party, equally optimistic, attracted Jeremy Thorpe to the city during his campaign.   In a closely fought contest, George Machin took the seat with a majority of 1,141, despite Labour's vote share declining by 15.6%. This was largely down to the strong performance of the SNP, who increased its own by 21.2%. The latter's campaign capitalised on keeping North Sea oil in Scotland to benefit people living in urban areas. A similar platform was used in the Glasgow Govan by-election later that year, successfully electing Margo MacDonald to the House of Commons.", "Political scientist David Boothroyd believes that the intervention of the Labour Party of Scotland in the Dundee by-election prevented similar accomplishment by splitting the nationalist vote. Indeed, the 1,409 votes for MacLean outnumbered Machin's majority over his SNP rival Gordon Wilson; Boothroyd further opines \"it is questionable whether voters were clear about [the party's] origin.\" Nevertheless, the SNP's popularity in both 1973 by-elections served as a prelude to the \"It's Scotland's oil\" political campaign, which has since become synonymous with the party's economic case for Scottish independence.Brocklehurst, Steven ", "On 2 May 1973 elections to Dundee City Council commenced, with the Labour Party of Scotland fielding a total of nine candidates in eight of the city's 12 wards. MacLean stood in the Downfield area and returned the party's best result, capturing 242 ballots and 6.1% of the vote; D. McGarry, one of two party candidates in Camperdown, produced the weakest, collecting 1.6% with 123 votes. None of the party's candidates were elected, leading to its quiet dissolution 22 days later. Such a decision was made in conjunction with the previously unaffiliated Glasgow party so that \"the national movement could show a united front\"; commentators Andrew Murray Scott and Iain MacLeay simply surmise \"[n]either group was successful\". Dissolved by a motion with seven for and just one against, most of their members duly returned to the SNP, some becoming involved with the party's pirate station Radio Free Scotland. Without the encumbrance of the minor Dundee group, Gordon Wilson was returned as Member of Parliament for Dundee East in February's general election of the following year, concurrently serving as Depute Leader of his party. Wilson later served as Leader of the SNP from 1979 to 1990, succeeding William Wolfe."]}, {"page": "Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland", "response": ["SNP leader Gordon Wilson was determined to end factionalism inside the SNP, and at the party conference of 1982 internal groupings were banned.
