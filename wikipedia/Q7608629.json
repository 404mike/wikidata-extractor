He specialises in expressionistic oil paintings. His subjects include city scapes, landscapes, architecture, still life, portraits and Christian works.\nSince 1992, Whatley has been honoring the anniversaries of architectural landmarks in London by painting them in their centenary years. He typically paints them on location. Landmarks he has painted include Bush House - former home of the BBC World Service, Broadcasting House, BBC Television Centre and the Tate Gallery, Tate Britain, Tate Modern, and Tower Bridge.Since the year 2000, Whatley's Christian faith (he was born Anglican and converted to Roman Catholicism in 2011) has inspired him to paint numerous tributes to Catholic devotions.In December 2008 TIME magazine editors selected his portrait tribute of Barack Obama from 100,000 images on the photography site Flickr.com for publication. It was published  in TIME magazine's 'Person of The Year' issue 2008/2009. The portrait is now in the private collection of an American property developer living in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whatley (surname)", "response": ["* Stephen B.
