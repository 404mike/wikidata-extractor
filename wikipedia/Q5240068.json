Curle said that Pearce would not be given a free transfer, and claimed that a \u00a3500,000 bid had been rejected during the season. He joined League Two club Barnet on a three-month loan on 14 September, and made his debut the next day, playing in central defence alongside David Stephens in a 3\u20130 defeat away to Bradford City. Pearce scored his first goal for the club with a glancing header from a John Oster corner as Barnet beat Northampton Town 4\u20130 at Underhill on 19 October. He continued as a first-team regular until returning to Notts County when his loan expired, match-fit and hopeful of proving himself to Curle. He played the last two games of County's 2012\u201313 season, and scored the last goal of their campaign in a 2\u20132 draw with Coventry City at Meadow Lane. Out of contract at the end of the season, Pearce was told that any new deal was subject to budgetary considerations; in the event, he was released."]}, {"page": "Tom Bender (footballer)", "response": ["Bender was called up as a stand-by player for the Wales under-21 side for a friendly against Malta on 10 August 2010.
