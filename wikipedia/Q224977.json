In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers.

The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock fans; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"Di Bella, Christine. \"Blink 182 + Green Day\".
