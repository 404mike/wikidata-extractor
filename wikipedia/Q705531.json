Kirsty is pulled back into the Cenobite world, where the demons decide to keep her, but, having discovered the human identity of the Cenobites earlier, Kirsty appeals to their latent humanity, specifically the Cenobite leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Pinhead decides to release her, but he and his followers are killed by Channard, who has become a Cenobite himself. With the help of a teenage girl, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who unknowingly assisted Channard in opening the box, Kirsty and Tiffany escape the Cenobite world and close the gateway behind them.", "The ninth film in the franchise. It is the first film not to feature Doug Bradley as Pinhead and was shot in two weeks for $300,000. In 2011 it was released to a single theater in California for a crew showing that was ostensibly open to the public. It was suggested by Bloody Disgusting that the film was only shot so that The Weinstein Company would not lose its filming rights before it could produce a remake of the original. The film was released on DVD on 18 October 2011.", "The tenth film in the franchise. It began filming in early 2016. Like Revelations, it does not feature Doug Bradley as Pinhead. Bradley was offered the part but turned it down because the production company refused to let him read the script without signing a non-disclosure agreement regarding its contents. This film was released on DVD in February 2018.", "In October 2010, Patrick Lussier was hired to serve as director on a reboot of the Hellraiser franchise, with a script written by Todd Farmer. The film's story would have differed from the original film, as the creative team did not want to retell the same story. The story was intended to center on the world, and functions of the puzzle box. By 2011 however, the pair had dropped out of the project. In October 2013, Clive Barker was once again attached to the next Hellraiser film. Barker was hired to serve as writer/director, while Doug Bradley was announced to reprise his role as Pinhead. By 2014, Barker stated that he had completed a second draft for the script, stating that he may not serve as director on the project. The story was described as a \"very loose\" remake of the original film. In March 2017, the filmmaker stated that the \"script was written and delivered to Dimension years ago.\" He acknowledged that the franchise is now looking at adapting a sequel, instead.", "There have been two non-fiction books released that chronicle the Hellraiser films. The first, released on 21 May 2004, was published by Titan Books and titled The Hellraiser Chronicles. Written by Peter Atkins and Stephen Jones, with a foreword by Clive Barker, The Hellraiser Chronicles is a collection of production photographs, design sketches, excerpts from the scripts, and interviews with the cast and crew. The next book, The Hellraiser Films And Their Legacy, was released by McFarland & Company on 27 November 2006; it was written by Paul Kane, and features foreword by Pinhead actor Doug Bradley. Hellraiser Films collects the production history of all eight films, their spin-offs, as well as how the series relates to popular culture. The book provides an in-depth look at the film characters, and interpretations of the choices those characters make in the film. Hellraiser Films also provides a brief look at the fan short film No More Souls.", "In an interview, Doug Bradley stated that in 2002 Dimension Films received two scripts for a crossover featuring both Pinhead and Michael Myers, the antagonist of the Halloween series. One of the pitches involved Michael Myers opening the Lament Configuration as a child and being possessed by Samhain fleeing from Hell, and the Cenobites pursuing him in the present day. Although Dimension Films initially turned the project down because it believed the upcoming film Freddy vs. Jason would fail, the studio reconsidered after it grossed $114 million on a $30 million budget. According to Bradley, Clive Barker intended to return to write a screenplay while John Carpenter was being considered to direct. The project ultimately ended when Halloween's producer Moustapha Akkad rejected the idea and due to a negative response from the fans of both franchises."]}, {"page": "Barbara Crampton", "response": ["Crampton next appeared in Abner Pastoll's \"taut Euro thriller\" Road Games, in which she speaks both French and English.
