She first played the event in 1912, finishing second and almost took the title in 1920 and 1921, when she narrowly missed out in the play-offs, having placed equal first. Her victory in 1948 at the age of 76, makes her the oldest player ever to win a full national championship that time (with Viktor Korchnoi surpassing her world record when winning the national Swiss Chess Championship in 2009 at age of 78, Korchnoi later was Swiss Champion again at age of 80 in 2011).\nShe took sixth at London 1927 (the first Women's World Chess Championship) and took second at Folkestone 1933 (the fourth Women's World Chess Championship), both won by Vera Menchik.", "link_mentions": {}}}
