Although results were still disappointing, the standard of the Welsh side was thought to be improving rapidly as margins of defeat became smaller and several defeats to the English and Scottish sides between 1902 and 1905 were deemed unlucky by match reporters based on the run of play. The side also avoided defeat in an away fixture against the Scots in March 1904 after holding their opponents to a 1\u20131 draw. The following year, Wales defeated Scotland for the first time in the team's history when goals from Meredith, Grenville Morris and Walter Watkins secured a 3\u20131 victory, although Wales were unable to capitalise on the victory as they finished second to England in the 1905\u201306 British Home Championship after failing to win either of their remaining fixtures. Having missed the previous two years while serving a ban for his part in the 1905 English football bribery scandal, Meredith returned to play for Wales in the 1906\u201307 British Home Championship. In their first match, Wales defeated Ireland 3\u20132 in Belfast with Meredith scoring his side's second goal before Lot Jones scored the winning goal. Grenville Morris scored the only goal of the match to give Wales their third consecutive victory over Scotland. In Wales' final match, Lot Jones gave his side the lead at Craven Cottage before England equalised in the second half. England went on to draw their final game of the tournament against Scotland, handing Wales their first British Home Championship success. All 21 players used in the tournament were awarded a commemoration medal by the FAW for the achievement."]}]}}
