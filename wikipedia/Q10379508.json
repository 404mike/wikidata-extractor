His displays were enough to earn him a long-term contract and a short spell as the club's captain. He was part of the side that won the 2003 Football League Trophy Final, and scored in the Southern Area final against Cambridge United. He scored his first and only league goal for City in a 1\u20131 draw with Luton Town in November 2003.Burnell joined Wycombe Wanderers in July 2004 after Tony Adams' summer clearout which saw the departure of Michael Simpson, Dannie Bulman, Steve Brown and Darren Currie.
