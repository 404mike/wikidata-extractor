Initially playing blues rock and jazz fusion, the band soon incorporated elements of hard rock, folk and classical music, forging a signature progressive rock sound. The group\u2019s bandleader, founder, primary composer and only constant member is Ian Anderson, a multi-instrumentalist who mainly plays flute and acoustic guitar, and is also the lead vocalist. The group has featured a revolving door of musicians throughout the decades, including significant contributors such as electric guitarist Martin Barre (the longest serving member besides Anderson), keyboardists John Evan, Dee Palmer, Peter-John Vettese and Andrew Giddings, drummers Clive Bunker, Barrie \"Barriemore\" Barlow and Doane Perry, and bassists Glenn Cornick, Jeffrey Hammond, John Glascock, Dave Pegg and Jonathan Noyce.\nAfter achieving moderate recognition performing in the London club scene, the band released their debut album This Was in 1968. After a lineup change which saw original guitarist Mick Abrahams replaced by Martin Barre, the band released the folk-tinged second album Stand Up (1969). Stand Up saw the band achieve their first commercial success, reaching No. 1 in the UK, followed by regular tours of the UK and the US. Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums Aqualung (1971), Thick as a Brick (1972) and A Passion Play (1973), and shifted again to contemporary folk rock with Songs from the Wood (1977), Heavy Horses (1978) and Stormwatch (1979). In the early 1980s the band underwent a major lineup change and shifted towards electronic rock, with the albums A (1980), The Broadsword and the Beast (1982) and Under Wraps (1984). The band won their sole Grammy Award for the 1987 album Crest of a Knave, which saw them returning to a hard rock style. Jethro Tull have sold an estimated 60 million albums worldwide, with 11 gold and five platinum albums among them. They have been described by Rolling Stone as \"one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands\".The last works as a group to contain new material prior to their hiatus were J-Tull Dot Com (1999) and a Christmas album in 2003, though the band continued to tour until 2011. Both Anderson and Barre have continued to record and tour as solo artists, with Anderson saying in 2014 that Jethro Tull \"came more or less to an end\". The current group\u2014now billed as \"Ian Anderson and the Jethro Tull band\"\u2014includes musicians who were part of Jethro Tull during the last years of its initial run as well as newer musicians associated with Anderson's solo band, however without Barre's involvement. Jethro Tull released The Zealot Gene, their first studio album in 19 years (and their first one to feature all original, new material in 23 years), on 28 January 2022.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John O'Hara (disambiguation)", "response": ["John O'Hara (1905\u20131970) was an American writer of Appointment in Samarra, Butterfield 8, and many short stories.", "John O'Hara may also refer to:", "* John O'Hara (Brooklyn politician), American lawyer ", "* John O'Hara (racing driver), driver for A1 Team Ireland in the A1 Grand Prix", "* John O'Hara (musician), English keyboardist and conductor, currently member of Jethro Tull", "* John O'Hara (singer), leader of O'Hara's Playboys (a Glasgow band in the 1960s-1970s)  ", "* John O'Hara (soccer, born 1959), American soccer defender", "* John O'Hara (footballer, born 1981), Irish professional soccer goalkeeper", "* John O'Hara (American football) (1944\u20131992), American college football coach", "* John O'Hara (wrestler) (1913\u20131983), Australian Olympic wrestler"]}, {"page": "Thick as a Brick 2", "response": ["* John O'Hara \u2013  accordion, Hammond organ, piano, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Thick as a Brick \u2013 Live in Iceland", "response": ["* John O'Hara \u2013 keyboards, accordion"]}, {"page": "Kantorei Barmen-Gemarke", "response": ["They recorded cantatas and passions by Johann Sebastian Bach, both with Kahlh\u00f6fer as with Kl\u00e4sener.

Reviewer Christopher Fifield noted that they do justice to Bruch's early style, especially at the \"jubilant end\". In 2012 they were invited to concerts in Israel with the Sinfonietta Beer Sheva, to celebrate the orchestra's 40th anniversary.
