He was born in Leicester and died in Horns Cross, Bideford, Devon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Keith Emerson", "response": ["In 1967, Emerson formed the Nice with Lee Jackson, also of the T-Bones, David O'List, and Ian Hague, after soul singer P. P. Arnold asked him to form a backing band. After replacing Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on its own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and theatrical abuse of the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes as \"symphonic rock\". To increase the visual interest of his show, Emerson abused his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating it with a whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians."]}, {"page": "Gong (band)", "response": ["Gong are a progressive rock band that incorporates elements of jazz and space rock into their musical style.

The second part, Angel's Egg, followed in December, now featuring the 'classic' rhythm section of Mike Howlett on bass and Pierre Moerlen on drums. In early 1974 Moerlen left to work with the French contemporary ensemble Les Percussions de Strasbourg and Smyth left to give birth to her and Allen's second son. They were replaced once again by Rob Tait and Diane Stewart, and the band moved from its French base at Pavillon du Hay to an English one at Middlefield Farm, near Witney, Oxfordshire.Allen, Daevid. Gong Dreaming 2. SAF Publishing, 2009, p.291. Moerlen, and later Smyth, returned in order to complete the trilogy with the album You, but by the time of its release, in October 1974, Moerlen was back with Les Percussions de Strasbourg and Smyth had settled permanently in Dei\u00e0 with her young sons. Prior to touring in support of You, Allen visited Smyth and the boys in Dei\u00e0, while the rest of the band, including the departed Moerlen, recorded the basic tracks for Hillage's first solo album, Fish Rising. Moerlen was initially replaced in Gong by a succession of stand-ins (Chris Cutler, Laurie Allan and Bill Bruford) until former Nice and Refugee drummer Brian Davison took the job in early 1975.See in the gigs section of Planet Gong's website Smyth had already been replaced by Hillage's partner Miquette Giraudy."]}, {"page": "The Nice", "response": ["The group was formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P.

The next week, Welch wrote in the Melody Maker that \"it was the first time I had seen a group actually in the act of winning its first following in quite dramatic circumstances\". When Arnold went back to her family in the US shortly afterwards, Oldham offered the group a contract of their own.
