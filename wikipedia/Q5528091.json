Cheltenham made the better start and the first chance fell to Gillespie in the seventh minute, following a long pass from McCann, but Steve Mildenhall, the Grimsby goalkeeper, made the save.  Three minutes later, a mistake from Jones allowed Guinan to shoot, but his strike was straight at Mildenhall; Woodhouse's shot then cleared the Grimsby crossbar by some distance.  In the 17th minute, Finnigan's attempt went wide before an aerial collision between Craig Armstrong and Reddy forced both players to be substituted, Mickey Bell coming for Cheltenham and Gary Cohen for Grimsby.  In the 33rd minute, Parkinson claimed he was fouled in the Cheltenham penalty area by Gavin Caines, but no penalty was awarded.  Four minutes later Jones headed the ball wide of the Cheltenham goal, and after another two, Wilson struck a shot wide.  In the last minute of the first half, Shane Higgs saved a low shot from Cohen before Parkinson's strike went over the crossbar.
