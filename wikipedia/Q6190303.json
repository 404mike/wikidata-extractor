He was born in Manchester, Lancashire, England, and he is also the twin brother of bandmate Andy and the son of noted modernist architect Desmond Williams. Before their incarnation as Doves, the three members were a dance-club music trio called Sub Sub.\nHis earlier bands include Metro Trinity, whose first EP called \"Die Young\" was released in 1987 on Cafetieria Records, based in Hulme, Manchester. Members also included Tim Whiteley, Colin Rocks, Pete Zichovitch and Jonny Male, who later became the main songwriter/guitarist in the band Republica.\nWhile Doves were on a hiatus between 2010 and 2020, Jez and Andy Williams formed a side project called Black Rivers, releasing a self-titled album in February 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of twins", "response": ["* Andy and Jez Williams, members of Doves"]}, {"page": "Doves (band)", "response": ["Doves are an English alt rock band formed in Manchester.

In 1993 they released \"Ain't No Love (Ain't No Use),\" which reached No.\u00a03 in the UK Singles Chart. On the Williams twins' birthday in February 1996, the band's Ancoats studio caught fire and burned down, leading the band members to abandon their previous dance-oriented style and start afresh as alternative rock band Doves in 1998. On the band's change of direction, Jez Williams said: \"We were faced with a really black and white decision: throw the towel in or carry on. And if you're going to carry on, you've got to put everything into it to justify it, because before that you've lost everything. That was quite a liberating feeling, actually.\"", "The band's fourth album, Kingdom of Rust, was released in April 2009. Prior to the new release, Doves offered a free download of the album's lead track \"Jetstream\" on their website. On 27 January 2009 the band announced a week's worth of tour dates from 12\u201319 March, in which new album tracks made their debuts.

There's a lot of subject matter on that album dealing with change. Buildings get ripped down and replaced by more generic ones. It kind of gave ourselves a bit of purpose to write about it. We also listened to a lot of Motown and Northern soul, and I think that came out in that album. It was a definite change.

Jez Williams told NME, \"This time around, we had a lot more confidence.\" In a 2010 interview with Spinner.com, Jez furthered, \"It was like a big burst of energy... it affected our songwriting. We wanted it to be optimistic, more hopeful.\" The band moved away from the Cheetham Hill studio they had recorded Lost Souls in for Revolution Studios in Manchester, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Bath, The Dairy and 2\u00a0kHz Studios in London, and a cottage in Lancashire (additionally, \"M62 Song\" was recorded under a flyover of the M62 motorway in Northenden). In a 2009 interview with QTheMusic.com, Jez said that the songs came quickly and effortlessly: \"I had this little house in Northenden where my makeshift studio was. It took a couple of nights to get the backing track with the top line melody to \"There Goes the Fear\". Literally the next night I had \"Words\" coming out of the speakers.\" \"Caught by the River\" was the final song recorded for the album, which took form at a rehearsal room in Stockport called The Green Room. \"Jimi, Andy and I just started to play these three chords. Jimi started to sing this great top line melody and there it was... very natural and easy. Andy started to write these very poignant lyrics about a friend of ours; everything started to click like at the start of the recording. That was the last piece of the jigsaw for the album,\" said Jez. The band also incorporated string, brass, and woodwind arrangements into the songs, arranged by The High Llamas frontman Sean O'Hagan, as well as gospel choir vocals on \"Satellites\", while lead single \"There Goes the Fear\" features a Brazilian Carnival-inspired percussive outro. Doves wrote, recorded, and mixed the album within eight months, \"which for Doves was incredibly fast,\" concluded Jez Williams.", "The Last Broadcast was released on 29 April 2002, and topped the UK Albums Chart.Doves - Chart Stats The release of the first single \"There Goes the Fear\" on 15 April brought the band their highest-charting single to date, peaking at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart.

When asked in a 2010 interview with Under the Radar as to why the single was limited, Jez Williams stated, \"It was to do something different from the norm. Just wanted to try something different really. I can't remember exactly whose idea it was. It might have been the manager's, but we were kind of into it. A kind of statement, in a way. We liked the fact that you could only get a hold of a certain amount of this or a certain amount of that.

The album's second single \"Pounding\" was released in July 2002, and peaked at number 21, while third and final single \"Caught by the River\" was released in October 2002 and reached number 29 on the charts.
