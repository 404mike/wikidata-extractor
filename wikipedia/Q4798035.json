This church was located in the grounds of West Woodhay House, and was designed by John Vanbrugh. The 1717 building was destroyed and replaced in 1882/3 with the current church, designed by Arthur Blomfield, which stands on a slightly different site to the church preceding it."]}, {"page": "Saint Alban", "response": ["St Alban's Church in Copenhagen, Denmark, which is the city's only Anglican church. It was built to the design of Sir Arthur Blomfield and consecrated in 1887. The connection with Denmark goes back to the Middle Ages where a church dedicated to Saint Alban was built in Odense. Supposedly, the relics of the saint had been brought here, maybe as early as the ninth century. It was in that church that King Canute IV of Denmark (Saint Canute) was murdered in 1086. The original church no longer exists, but the Roman Catholic parish church of Odense, St Alban's Church, was consecrated in 1908."]}]}}
