In addition to drawing inspiration from the Paradise Garage, the club borrowed the idea of using changing set designs from another New York City club, Area, with the first being based around Blade Runner, Berkmann's favourite film."]}, {"page": "Marcus Berkmann", "response": ["Berkmann was educated at Highgate School and Worcester College, Oxford.
