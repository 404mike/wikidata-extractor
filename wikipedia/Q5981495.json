While admitting that the containment structure for Fukushima Dai-ichi was more much advanced than that at Chernobyl, he claimed there could be \"nuclear explosion\" rather than (as reported) a hydrogen explosion, if fuel elements had melted down and collected at the bottom of the vessel.  He also asserted that radiation levels measured at a reactor north of Fukushima Dai-ichi (i.e. Onagawa) indicated that \"up to 100 kilometers away, we are getting concentrations of plutonium, cesium and iodine\" (sic \u2013 presumably radionuclides thereof) released from Fukushima Dai-ichi, making the releases comparable in his opinion to Chernobyl, in terms of human health impact.  In response to Fells' characterisation of the worst immediate effects being loss of power to an advanced industrial society, Busby said \"this is a radiological catastrophe already\", asserting in particular that plutonium releases were a major cause of concern."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle University people", "response": ["* Ian Fells - professor"]}, {"page": "2000 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor Ian Fells, Professor of Energy Conversion, University of Newcastle.
