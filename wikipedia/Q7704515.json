The team struggled, and after two years in post, Bell was replaced by England's World Cup-winning manager Sir Alf Ramsey, who had been on the board at Birmingham since January 1976, and who agreed to take over so long as the job title was not manager but consultant. After six months, during which time the team remained near the foot of the table, star player Francis made increasingly public his desire to leave a club he saw as lacking ambition, and captain Terry Hibbitt spoke of what the Guardian Patrick Barclay dubbed a \"crisis of morale\", Ramsey recommended that both Francis and defender Joe Gallagher be sold. After the board backtracked on Francis, Ramsey left the club. Meanwhile, an action group known as the \"Blue Revolution\" had formed in an attempt to channel the increasing off-field discontent towards forcing change in the boardroom. Its public meetings were well attended, it organised a walkout of supporters from a match against Arsenal, and it publicly offered \u00a3250,000 to buy out the Coombs' holding in the club."]}]}}
