Hudson (drums) (born Brian James Hudson, 21 April 1938, Cleveland, North Yorkshire). The original line-up played at St George's Hall, Liverpool, on Friday, 15 May 1959. Johnny Hutchinson (born 18 July 1940) replaced Hudson in July 1959. In need of a bass guitarist, Hutchinson brought in Johnny Gustafson in December. At that time, Gustafson did not have a proper bass guitar, so Barber converted an acoustic for him. Gustafson's first gig was at The Tower Ballroom, New Brighton, on 31 December 1959."]}, {"page": "Cass & The Cassanovas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Casser"]}, {"page": "Casey Jones & The Engineers", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Casser"]}, {"page": "Casser, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Casser"]}]}}
