The result is classic Hollywood star magnetism, engaging auds [audiences] physically and vocally, as his narration proves to be a crucial element of the pic's humor.\" The critic also positively compared Willems' cinematography to the style in D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2006) and commended the tempo set by the film's editors Naomi Geraghty and Tracy Adams and by composer Paul Leonard-Morgan.", "Category:Films scored by Paul Leonard-Morgan"]}, {"page": "Dredd", "response": ["Paul Leonard-Morgan wrote the film's industrial music score.

Leonard-Morgan said, \"I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn't be placed in any particular era. So it's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes.\" For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo-Mo narcotic, he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down to match the visuals, such that one second of his composed score could last ten minutes (slowed to 0.17% of original).
