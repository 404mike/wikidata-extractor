He is considered by many musicians, producers, and journalists to be the best drummer of his generation.During The Stone Roses, he could be easily identified by the now-iconic bucket hat. Following his departure from the band in 1995, he fronted The Rub from 1998 to 2001, who played several low-key shows but split without releasing any material.\nAfter a long industry hiatus, he re-emerged on the music scene with the reformation of The Stone Roses in October 2011. After the band's apparent final show at Hampden Park in Glasgow, Scotland, in June 2017 he has since returned to obscurity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Stone Roses", "response": ["The Stone Roses were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. One of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani and drummer Reni.", "The Stone Roses then released their second album, Second Coming, in 1994, which was met with mixed reviews. The group soon disbanded after several line-up changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at Reading Festival.", "Like the earlier attempts at bands, The Waterfront fizzled out, but in late 1983 Couzens decided to try again at starting a band, and approached Brown.Robb, p. 77 They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in The Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission that he could not play anything but \"Block Buster!\").Robb, p. 78 They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band's line-up was cemented. Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown's vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks.Robb, p. 79 After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with \"The Stone Roses\". Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called \"English Rose\" or that the name was somehow linked to The Rolling Stones, but these were untrue, Brown explaining \"No, I don't know where that English Rose story came from. John thought up the name 'Stone Roses' - something with a contrast, two words that went against each other\".Robb, p. 80 The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join Terry Hall's band The Colourfield.Robb, p. 81 They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan \"Reni\" Wren in May 1984.Robb, p.\u00a083\u20134", "In March 1995, just two weeks before a tour in support of Second Coming was due to begin, Reni exited the band, following a disagreement with Ian Brown. A replacement drummer was found in Robbie Maddix, who had previously worked with Rebel MC.Larkin, Colin (ed.) (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave, Virgin Books,  Also recruited around this time for the live shows was session-keyboardist/programmer Nigel Ippinson, who had previously played with the band on the \"Chic Remix\" re-working of \"Begging You\" for its release as a single. A secret \"come-back\" tour of the UK was planned for April 1995 but cancelled after the music press announced the dates. A major blow was the cancellation of their engagement at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1995. John Squire had suffered a mountain-biking accident in northern California weeks before the show, breaking his collarbone. The band finally organised a full UK tour for November and December 1995 and all dates sold out in a day.", "Reni remained inactive for the most part after the Roses' breakup. He started a new band called The Rub in 1999, and played several gigs but nothing has been heard of The Rub since. In an interview in 2005 he said he was writing new songs to perform with Mani.\"STONE ROSES REUNION - RENI SPEAKS\", NME, 31 May 2005. Retrieved on 23 December 2007", "After the newspaper The Sun published a story on 14 October 2011 citing that the Roses had signed for a series of gigs across the UK, rumours again began to circulate. The NME reported that Alan 'Reni' Wren had responded to these rumours, contacting them with a cryptic message that read: \"Not before 9T will I wear the hat 4 the Roses again\". On 17 October, Dynamo told The Sun that Brown had confirmed the reunion by saying that the band were \"ready to take the world by storm\", and that Brown had sent him a text message with the words \"It's happening\". On 18 October 2011, the Stone Roses announced at a press conference the end of a fifteen-year split. An \"extensive\" Reunion Tour of the world, starting in Warrington, for a low-key warm-up show, was scheduled. However, the main attractions of the tour were three homecoming shows at Heaton Park, Manchester, on 29\u201330 June and 1 July 2012 plus one show in Dublin's Phoenix Park on 5 July 2012. In a press conference interview, the members of the Stone Roses said they had plans to record a third album. 150,000 tickets for the two Heaton Park shows sold out in 14 minutes, with the band then announcing a third show at the venue to be held on 1 July 2012. They then announced a show would take place in Ireland, with Ian Brown saying \"After Manchester, Ireland is always next on our list\".Sweeney, Ken. \"Ireland, here we come, say resurrected Stone Roses\". Irish Independent. 19 October 2011.\"Stone Roses to play Irish concert\". The Irish Times. 22 October 2011. The first leg of the tour would consist of two warm-up gigs in Barcelona in early June and then shows in the Netherlands, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and France.", "As John Robb commented: \"The Stone Roses would stonewall the journalist[s]. With shy guffaws, muttered asides, dispassionate staring, foot-shuffling silences and complete mind-numbing gaps, punctuated by the odd piece of incisive home-spun philosophy from Brown, who occasionally hinted at a well-read mind. There would be complete silence from John Squire, witty banter from Reni, and Mani spouting off if he let his guard drop.\"Robb, P. 225 However, Robb clarified they \"were no fools when it came to the media\". He concluded: \"One feature of the band's career had been their ability to stay on the news pages of the rock press almost permanently for years on end, including the years when they did fuck all.

During the band's split, he occasionally joined Ian Brown on stage for renditions of songs by the Stone Roses (\"Waterfall\", \"Made of Stone\", \"I Am the Resurrection\"), as happened in 2008 at Summercase Festival (in Madrid and Barcelona), when both Primal Scream and Brown were playing on the same day.

According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the rhythm section of bassist Mani and drummer Reni played in a manner that was merely suggestive of dance rhythms, while Ian Brown dispassionately sang lyrics expressing arrogant sentiments such as \"I Wanna Be Adored\" and \"I Am the Resurrection\". In the opinion of Spin critic Andrew Unterberger, it sounded more like \"an exercise in rock classicism\", featuring accessible melodies like those of the Beatles and resonant guitars similar to the Byrds, along with \"the cheeky (and quintessentially British) humor of the Smiths\" and \"the self-fulfilling arrogance of the Sex Pistols\".
