Investment by new director Peter Wetzel allowed Bremner to spend \u00a3120,000 on three players in March: \u00a360,000 on Stirling Albion defender John Philliben, \u00a325,000 on young Celtic midfielder Jim Dobbin, and \u00a335,000 on Shrewsbury Town defender Alan Brown.

Inheriting a side that had won the Third Division championship under Ian Porterfield, including such players as John Breckin, Tony Towner and Ronnie Moore, Rotherham made a patchy start to the season and were in the relegation zone in January. However, a run of nine wins in a row followed and Rotherham climbed from third last to third place in the league. Promotion was missed by four points, but the finish of 7th place was the Millers' highest since the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Simon Tracey", "response": ["Tracey began his goalkeeper coaching career in 2004 at Rotherham United F.C., replacing previous coach Graham Brown.
