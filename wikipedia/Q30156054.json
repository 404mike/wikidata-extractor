The first produced a perspective view of an object directly from drawings of the plan and elevations.  The second machine enabled a scene or person to be traced from life onto paper with considerable precision; he and Dr Alexander Blair used it to document the important Neolithic monuments at Carnac, France, with \"almost photographic accuracy\". He also created the ubiquitous portable tripod stand with three pairs of hinged legs to support his drawing board in the field.  He manufactured these instruments himself and several hundred of them were sold. One of his first customers was mining engineer John Taylor."]}, {"page": "Thomas Dale (priest)", "response": ["Lost churches of Southwark Diocese He served as Professor of English at London University from 1828 to 1830.
