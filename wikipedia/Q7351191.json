The series hired two Japanese translators to produce the proper Japanese translation of the phrase and its associated Kanji glyph, due to the fact that \"fox hunting\" is not a pre-existing term in the Japanese language.Meisler, p. 111", "The episode received mixed reviews from television critics.

Club gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a C+. He wrote that, despite his love for \"Pusher\", \"'Kitsunegari' isn't anywhere near as good as its predecessor\". Handlen cited the change in Modell's personality, his lack of a desire to kill, and Scully's portrayal as a \"humorless scold who only sees the truth when required to for narrative convenience\" as reasons why the episode was weak.
