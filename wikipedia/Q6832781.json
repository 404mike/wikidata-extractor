The policy of \"unity by consent\" continued into the 1990s, eventually being replaced by a policy of neutrality in line with the Downing Street Declaration. The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn supports a united Ireland, although he has said that it is \"up for the Irish people to decide\" whether to remain part of the UK. They do not organise electorally in Northern Ireland, respecting the SDLP as their sister party within the Party of European Socialists. Similarly, the Liberal Democrats co-operate with the Alliance Party and share their support of the Good Friday Agreement while expressing reservations about what they perceive as 'institutionalised sectarianism' in the agreement.

The club would be based here for the next four years. The opening of the first clubhouse was marked by an inaugural banquet for 1,900 people at the Royal Aquarium off Parliament Square, which Punch reported saw the consumption of 200 dozen bottles of Pommery champagne.Michael Meadowcroft, Celebrating 130 years o high Victorian style and elegance (NLC News, No. 63, November 2012), pp. 12\u201314.

Michael Meadowcroft explains that this was done to provide, \"membership for Liberals who, by reason of their employment, such as judges, military officers or senior civil servants, were not permitted to divulge their politics\", and so who had been previously debarred by the club's insistence on all members signing a declaration of Liberal politics. This continues to this day, with Members signing a pledge that they will \"not use the club or...membership thereof for political activities adverse to Liberalism\", and not having full voting rights at Annual General Meetings, but otherwise enjoying the full benefits of club membership.National Liberal Club application form, 2011.", "The NLC is a private members' club, with membership needing the nomination of an existing member, and a waiting period of at least one month. Members are in one of two categories: either Members, who sign a declaration that they shall not use the club's facilities or their membership for 'political activities adverse to Liberalism', or Political Members, who sign the same declaration, plus an additional declaration that they are a Liberal in their politics, in exchange for additional voting rights within the club. Non-political Membership was first introduced in 1932, to allow Liberals to join when they had been barred up until that point, as several occupations such as judges, army officers and senior civil servants specifically forbade political declarations.Michael Meadowcroft, \"Celebrating 130 Years of High Victorian Style and Elegance\", NLC News, Issue 63, pp. 13\u201314.", "When the club was originally launched in 1882, like every other London club of the era it had no prescriptive dress code. In 1888, a simple requirement was introduced that \"No member shall appear in any public rooms of the Club in a dressing gown, slippers, or other deshabille.\" Beyond that, the club's only dress code was a request in the Regulations that members \"dress and conduct themselves in a manner consistent with civilised standards\", but precisely how members chose to observe that remained a matter of considerable personal interpretation.Michael Meadowcroft, \"Breaking the Code\", NLC News, Issue 72, April 2017, pp. 22-23. Indeed, the club's first official history, in 1925, noted that an unusual feature of the NLC was the way in which it enjoyed far more casual dress than other London clubs, with members turning up in their working clothes, and it singled out, \"the practical tabooing of evening dress, which assisted in securing the attendance of the House of Commons and Press Gallery men for at least part of the social evening.\"", "*Desmond Banks, Baron Banks, President of the Liberal Party 1968\u201369; President of the ClubMichael Meadowcroft, A Guide to the Works of Art of the National Liberal Club, London (National Liberal Club, London, 2011), p. 33.", "*David Low, cartoonistMichael Meadowcroft, A Guide to the Works of Art of the National Liberal Club, London (National Liberal Club, London, 2011), p. 21.", "*Michael Meadowcroft, Liberal MP 1983\u201387", "*James Meston, 1st Baron Meston, civil servant and businessman; Chairman of the ClubMichael Meadowcroft, A Guide to the Works of Art of the National Liberal Club, London (National Liberal Club, London, 2011), p. 32.", "*Robert Spence Watson, reformer and political activist; President of the National Liberal Federation, 1890\u20131902; founder member of the club, later its Vice-PresidentMichael Meadowcroft, A Guide to the Works of Art of the National Liberal Club, London (National Liberal Club, London, 2011), p. 18.", "*Michael Meadowcroft, A Guide to the Works of Art of the National Liberal Club, London (London: National Liberal Club, 2011)."]}, {"page": "Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)", "response": ["The SDP was not alone in having members who rejected the merger with the Liberal Party to form the Social and Liberal Democrats.
