Allen, p.98 Another similar scheme was the Northumberland & Lancashire Union which would have run from Gateshead near Newcastle upon Tyne to Barnard Castle, and then as the York & Carlisle line across the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to Tebay. Additionally the  Yorkshire and Glasgow Union Railway was planned to run west from Thirsk through Wensleydale to Hawes, then north through the Mallerstang Valley to Kirkby Stephen, and then through the Eden Valley to Clifton via Appleby-in-Westmorland. Both the Yorkshire & Glasgow Union and part of the York & Carlisle Junction to Tebay were empowered by acts of Parliament in 1845The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.480 but the end of the Railway bubble of the 1840s meant that they were not built.", "The act of Parliament authorising South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway was passed on 13 July 1857,The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.561 and that for the Eden Valley Railway came soon after on 21 May 1858.", "The act allowed the raising a capital of \u00a3180,000, the appointed directors of the company include important figures from Westmorland and CumberlandOnce a year, tales and legends of Westmorland, Issue 1, John Close, 1862, \"The Eden Valley Railway\", pp.106-7, google books including William Brougham,  Sir Richard Tufton Isaac Wilson as well as Henry Pease.The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.568", ", via www.flickr.com of three  lattice girder iron spans.The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.607", "Soon after opening the amalgamation of the railway into the Stockton and Darlington Railway along with the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway and Frosterley and Stanhope Railway was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament on 30 June 1862.The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.605 The following year the Stockton and Darlington merged into the North Eastern Railway,The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, Appendix E \"Railway and Dock Companies merged into the North Eastern Railway\", pp.778-9 and the Eden Valley line too became part of that larger system.", "*The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, 1915, online version via www.archive.org"]}, {"page": "James Walker (engineer)", "response": ["*Survey for the Leeds and Selby Railway (1829)The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, 1915, p. 203, online version via www.archive.org"]}, {"page": "Willie Yeadon", "response": ["*William Weaver Tomlinson, historian, author of \"The North Eastern Railway its rise and development"]}, {"page": "Cawood, Wistow and Selby Light Railway", "response": ["In 1899 the company's Board decided to pursue building an extension west from Cawood to Church Fenton. No clear junction with the railway there was specified, but the effect, deliberate or otherwise, was to unnerve the NER, who saw a potential threat should the Cawood line revive a venture along the lines of the 1879 scheme, which would allow the HBR to penetrate the NER's fiefdoms of York and Harrogate. The NER responded by buying the Cawood company for \u00a332,000. The sale was fully effective from 1 January 1900 and confirmed by the NER Act of 30 July 1900.The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, 1915, p.778, Appendix E, online version via www.archive.org The NER decided not to proceed with the extension to Church Fenton. The Cawood company was formally wound up on 27 February 1900, having, unusually for such ventures, paid a dividend to shareholders throughout its short life. Thereafter the NER operated the line as a branch, as did its successors, the LNER then finally the North Eastern Region of British Railways. An early passenger benefit from the NER's takeover occurred on 1 July 1904 when Cawood branch trains were diverted to run through to the main  station. The Brayton Gates terminus thereby became redundant. It was closed and soon demolished."]}, {"page": "William Tomlinson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*William Weaver Tomlinson (1858\u20131916), historian"]}, {"page": "Ken Hoole", "response": ["In addition to his own works, he also wrote forewords for, corrected and updated reprints of several historic works including William Weaver Tomlinson's North Eastern Railway, G.G.
