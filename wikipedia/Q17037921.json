He was elected to UKIP's National Executive Committee (NEC) in 2011 and was elected at the 2014 European Parliament election. He later contested Stockport as the UKIP candidate at the 2015 general election.\nWoolfe was considered a frontrunner in UKIP's September 2016 leadership election but was excluded from the race after submitting his nomination late. After Diane James resigned from the party leadership, he stood in the second UKIP leadership election of 2016 but withdrew after he was allegedly injured during an altercation with Mike Hookem, a fellow UKIP MEP. He resigned from UKIP in October 2016.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 6", "response": ["*  1967   \u2013 Steven Woolfe, English barrister and politician"]}, {"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["In September 2016, the major UKIP donor, Arron Banks, said that UKIP would be \"dead in the water\" if Diane James did not become leader.
