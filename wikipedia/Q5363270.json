Although the two printed copies are identical, none of the manuscripts precisely matches any of the others. The history of some of the versions remains unclear; no documentary evidence establishes that any of them is Carle's original. Georges Ascoli, a French literary scholar, examined most of the extant versions of the poem in 1920, and selected one that he believed closest to Carle's original. Ascoli included a transcript of the manuscript version in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale known as f. fr. 12795. The transcript in Georges Ascoli's La Grande-Bretagne Devant l'Opinion Fran\u00e7aise, Depuis la Guerre de Cent Ans Jusqu'\u00e0 la Fin du XVIe si\u00e8cle includes a line-by-line listing of all the variations between f. fr. 12795 and the other versions, along with some explanatory notes.
