Standing at six feet and ten inches tall, Millar is widely recognized as the third tallest player in world football to date. Millar was signed in January 2010 by then manager Ross Jack, after impressing at a Royal Air Force fixture held at the club's stadium. Millar is the only Elgin City F.C player to have scored in the League Two playoffs after an expertly dispatched volley beat Albion Rovers (1\u20130) in the first leg at Borough Briggs. Elgin City went on to lose the tie 2\u20131 in the second leg.\nMillar was involved in a nasty challenge and ruptured his ACL in April 2013 in the last minute of a 4\u20132 home victory against Clyde F.C where he scored a double to help his team to victory.\nHe was recently inducted into the Kirckaldy YM Hall of Fame at the annual award ceremony.After struggling with the injury to his cruciate knee ligament, Millar moved to Formartine United in July 2014, but left exactly a year later for fellow Scottish side Deveronvale, but never fully recovered.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2012\u201313 Raith Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Paul Millar"]}, {"page": "Paul Millar", "response": ["Paul Millar may refer to:", "*Paul Millar (footballer, born 1966), Northern Irish footballer and manager", "*Paul Millar (Scottish footballer) (born 1988), player for Elgin City", "*Paul Millar (poet), see 1996 in poetry"]}, {"page": "Paul Millar (footballer born 1988)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Millar (Scottish footballer)"]}]}}
