He made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1882 season. He also played for the North of England team. He shared most wickets for the club in the 1883,  1884, 1885 and 1886 seasons.

The collision resulted in a ruptured bowel and he died in the dressing room at Grimsby in the arms of his Staveley and Derbyshire County Cricket Club teammate George Hay.\nCropper was buried in Brimington churchyard and a memorial stone was erected from the proceeds of a subscription fund raised by his family and friends which can still be seen today.", "link_mentions": {}}}
