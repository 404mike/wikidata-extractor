John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti completed Lawrence's work; David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston wrote new episodes with reworked character designs akin to those of classic Quest. Each team produced half of the show's fifty-two episodes. While Lawrence's team crafted stories of real-world mystery and exploration, later writers used science fiction and paranormal plots. Turner supported the show through a massive marketing campaign with thirty-three licensees. Real Adventures debuted with an unprecedented wide release on Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT, airing twenty-one times per week. Critics have debated the merits of the show's animation, writing, and spirit compared to classic Quest, but it has also received praise in those categories.", "Hanna-Barbera created The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest in the early 1990s after being acquired by Turner Entertainment Co. Turner planned a series of year-long \"Turner-wide initiatives\" to capitalize on old characters and create new franchises. Turner received copious fan mail and phone inquiries about Quest, and observed \"incredibly high\" marketing Q Scores. The show was also Hanna-Barbera's most popular venture in the action-adventure genre; no other contemporary series featured realistic children enjoying lifelike adventures. With William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's blessings, the company planned a new series, live action film, and two telefilms\u2014Jonny's Golden Quest and Jonny Quest vs. The Cyber Insects. Combined with a substantial marketing campaign, the project would be their largest initiative since Turner acquired H-B. Turner Home Entertainment President Philip Kent claimed Quest would be a \"consumer-products bonanza\", and the company considered Real Adventures the linchpin of the Quest revival. Real Adventures, the live-action film, and release of classic episodes on VHS would constitute a \"Year of Jonny Quest\" marketing blitz. Delayed until 1996, the project echoed 1994's \"Year of the Flintstones\" and 1995's \"Year of Yogi Bear\". Production on Real Adventures commenced in 1993. Turner hired a team led by director Dick Sebast, writer Peter Lawrence, and art director Takashi Masunaga. The firm appointed Stephanie Sperber head of the Quest task force in 1994.", "Peter Lawrence aimed to \"go beyond cartooning and into animated film-making\" for the show's storytelling. Producers contracted seven studios to animate the first season, including Pacific Animation Co. in Japan and Toon's Factory in France. Japanese and Korean animators drew traditional cel sequences and added color; an international team handled digital post-production and QuestWorld scenes. Teva, a subsidiary of Total Group, organized a post-production team in Paris, led by Eric Jacquot, Gilles Deyries, and Pascal Legeay. Using video post-production high-end specialized tools, including Henry, Spirit, Flame, and others, the team strove to deliver a high-speed computer editing and post-production process. The majority of the first season's footage was digitally inked and painted to enhance background elements. Producers applied the process in excess of twenty hours per episode, adding light effects, rain, snow, glitter, reflections, and fog.", "Director Richard Donner, producer Lauren Shuler Donner, and Jane Rosenthal purchased rights for a live-action film, having expressed interest in the property after Turner acquired H-B. Peter Segal was attached to direct. Slated to begin production in mid-1995, filming was delayed until 1996 and ultimately never began. Turner advertised Real Adventures as the \"next evolution in children's programming ... [redefining] television animation for the next generation.\" The company hosted a 1995 discussion with Peter Lawrence and Takashi at Yanceyville, and later aired previews at United States waterpark events. Staged in major US cities, these \"dive-in theaters\" featured previews of new series and local celebrities, including Jennifer Love Hewitt, Lacey Chabert, Cameron Finley, and Ashley Johnson for the UCLA event. Turner announced the debut countries and TV stations on May 1, 1996.", "The Quests would sparingly fight \"monsters of the week\", instead battling antagonists whose conflicts lay in \"personal objective or ambition ... opposed by Dr. Quest\". Lawrence stationed the family at a new compound on the coast of Maine, replete with houses, barns, and workshops. Rooms suited for each character included a library for Dr. Quest, workshop for Jonny, computer-equipped den for Jessie, dojo and gym for Race, and lighthouse lookout for Hadji's meditation. Lawrence equipped Dr. Quest with a fleet of air, land, and sea vehicles, including a 1940s biplane and state-of-the-art catamaran named Questor with diving bells and smaller research vessels stored in the hulls. Peter Lawrence prided Real Adventures on the strength of its writing, opining that \"very few writers in this or any other field actually write visually,\" and contesting that each episode would have \"enough material or potential to develop into a movie\".", "Peter Lawrence described Jonny as a \"hero in training\" on the cusp of adulthood. He remarked that Jonny possessed \"a straight-ahead, right-on attitude\" free of introspection or self-doubt. At age 14, Jonny was a confident problem-solver prone to getting in trouble. Writers framed him as more an intuitive thinker than an intellectual, and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's daring lifestyle. Jonny inherited his father's driving curiosity (rendering him a \"walking query\"), as well as his mother's \"restless, adventurous spirit\". Takashi designed Jonny to be lean, wiry, athletic, and coordinated. Creative directors centered episodes around Jonny; Seibert summarized the shift:", "Jessie Bannon, age 15, was characterized to be just as tough, smarter, and more thoughtful than Jonny. Written as \"more of an egghead\", she elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race, and was \"more in tune with Hadji\". Turner conceived Jessie as cool, independent, and a strong role model for contemporary girls. Peter Lawrence took pains to ensure Jessie would not be written as \"a guy in a skirt\", and made her more mature than Jonny. Race Bannon (Jessie's father) age 38, retained his classic, laconic sense of humor and fearless, dependable nature. He retired from government work over ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency. Writers noted that Race was helplessly overprotective of Jessie, and Jonny was \"the boy Race never had\". Race was also given a western-US accent and a knack for crafting elaborate, colorful similes. Peter Lawrence sculpted Race to be a \"cowboy philosopher or philosopher-warrior\". Writers tasked Race with physical and self-defense training for the Quest team.", "The first season of Real Adventures featured J. D. Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actors Frank Welker and Michael Bell as Dr. Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage, respectively. A childhood fan of the original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's \"star quality\", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, \"Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special.\" Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: \"[he] is one of the few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us.\" A Star Wars fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for \"In the Realm of the Condor\". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an \"unusual case of multi-ethnic casting\".", "The producers struggled to cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence\u2014\"[Jesse Douglas] has immense energy, huge energy, and is the kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do\u2014you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [sic].\" Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, \"I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard for the rest of the storyline.\" Roth supported her, claiming that \"Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with...I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend.\" H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults \"there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on.\" Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having \"a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable.\"", "Hanna-Barbera founder and chairman Joseph Barbera considered Real Adventures a \"disaster\" because of changes to the characters and stories. He conceded, \"that's their business. Everybody needs to do their own thing.\" Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. People liked the cast, particularly George Segal. Saturday Morning Fever praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough to be part of the action. He considered Jessie \"cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action.\" He did not enjoy the \"toned down\" portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a \"man of action, not thought\u2014though perfectly capable of deep thought\", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality."]}, {"page": "The Burning (film)", "response": ["Based on the New York urban legend of the Cropsey maniac, the screenplay was written by Bob Weinstein and Peter Lawrence, from a story conceived by producer Harvey Weinstein, Tony Maylam, and Brad Grey. The film marks the debut of Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, and Holly Hunter. Rick Wakeman, of the progressive rock band Yes, composed the score.", "During his discussion with film critic Alan Jones on the commentary track of MGM's DVD, Maylam said that once he came on board things moved very quickly. The screenplay was written in just six weeks and was sculpted to conform to the emerging genre conventions of the time. As it was, the film takes place mostly outside and is set in summer, so there was only a small window of opportunity to make the film or, perhaps, have to wait until the following year. Knowing that the slasher craze would not last forever, and wanting to get their film released before it fizzled out, the producers rushed into production. The screenplay was written by Peter Lawrence and Harvey's brother, Bob Weinstein. Again, showing a knowledge of the then in-vogue conventions of the slasher movie, the script showcased a murder every ten minutes in the script. It was Maylam's idea to make Cropsy's weapon-of-choice gardening shears. The film originally had a different ending. A script dated July 6, 1980 shifted the location to one much more in keeping with a summer camp slasher. Originally, the showdown was to take place in a boathouse. The other big change is that Todd ends up as the \"final boy\" rather than as the heroic adult, and Alfred is killed by Cropsy. Other changes included an excised character named Alan, who was to be the love interest for Tiger. This version also ends with a campfire scene, but the last line is different: \"...And every year he seeks revenge for the terrible things those kids did to him ... every year he kills!\""]}, {"page": "Peter Lawrence AKA Geale Peter Lawrence", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Lawrence (author)"]}, {"page": "Peter Lawrence", "response": ["Peter Lawrence may refer to:", "*Peter Lawrence (pirate) (fl. 1693\u20131705), Dutch privateer and pirate (real name Pieter Laurens)", "*Peter Lawrence (anthropologist) (1921\u20131987), British-born Australian anthropologist", "*Peter Lawrence (author), American author and screenwriter", "*Peter Lawrence (politician), New York State Assembly member elected 2014", "*Peter Lawrence (teacher) (1913\u20132005), British teacher and author"]}, {"page": "Kevin Kiner", "response": ["| 1996\u201397 || The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest || Peter Lawrence || Warner Bros.
