Holmes argued that Page 3 perpetuated outdated sexist norms, portrayed women as sex objects, negatively affected girls' and women's body image, and contributed to a culture of sexual violence. Launched in August 2012, the campaign gained support at the Liberal Democrats party conference the following month, where former MP Evan Harris proposed a party motion to \"[tackle] the projection of women as sex objects to children and adolescents by restricting sexualised images in newspapers and general-circulation magazines to the same rules that apply to pre-watershed broadcast media\". Liberal Democrats MP Lynne Featherstone supported the motion, claiming that Page 3 contributed to domestic violence against women, although the party's then-leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg distanced himself from it over concerns about press freedom, stating: \"If you don't like it, don't buy it ... you don't want to have a moral policeman or woman in Whitehall telling people what they can and cannot see\". The No More Page 3 campaign collected over 240,000 signatures on an online petition and gained support from over 140 MPs, as well as a number of trade unions, universities, charities, and women's advocacy groups. It sponsored two women's soccer teams, Nottingham Forest Women F.C. and Cheltenham Town L.F.C., who played with the \"No More Page 3\" logo on their shirts."]}, {"page": "Romantic Novelists' Association Awards", "response": ["*     2015: Just a Girl, Standing in Front of a Boy by Lucy-Anne Holmes (Sphere) "]}, {"page": "No More Page 3", "response": ["No More Page 3 was a campaign to convince the owners and editors of The Sun to voluntarily cease its Page 3 feature, which it had published since 1970. Started by Lucy-Anne Holmes in August 2012, the campaign claimed that publishing images of topless glamour models in nationally circulated newspapers was an outdated, sexist, and inappropriate tradition that editors should discontinue. The campaign collected over 240,000 signatures on an online petition and gained support from over 140 MPs, a number of trade unions, over 30 universities, and many charities and other groups.", "The campaign began in August 2012 when Lucy-Anne Holmes observed that despite the achievements of Britain's female athletes in the London Olympics, the most prominent image of a woman in The Sun was its Page 3 model. She then launched an online petition asking the tabloid's then editor Dominic Mohan to remove images of topless women from Page 3. The petition accrued 84,000 signatures by March 2013 and by January 2015 the petition had reached 215,000 signatories. In February 2013, the campaign ran a Tweet Murdoch Day, asking supporters to flood The Suns proprietor Rupert Murdoch with messages. The campaign also tried to persuade Lego to stop running promotions in The Sun. Lego confirmed in March 2013 that their tie-in would end but denied that the move was due to the campaign.", "The Sun was reported in mid-January 2015 to have dropped the feature from the printed edition of the paper but it returned after less than a week on 22 January.
