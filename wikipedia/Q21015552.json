He was a contributor to the theory on mountain waves. Scorer also worked on the cloud physics and his exchanges with the American meteorologist Joanne Simpson helped to better understand the formation of cumulus clouds.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Meteorological Society", "response": ["* 1986\u20131988: Richard S. Scorer"]}, {"page": "Sam Scorer", "response": ["He was brought up in Lincoln, one of five children. His father was a senior partner in a firm of solicitors and later became clerk to Lindsey County Council. His mother was a lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste College, a teacher training college. A brother was Richard S. Scorer. Between 1936 and 1941 he attended the independent Repton School in south Derbyshire, where he became head boy and excelled at drawing."]}, {"page": "Castellanus", "response": ["To alleviate this confusion, scientists Richard S. Scorer and Corfidi propose a cloud classification based only on physical criteria obtained from vertical soundings and observations from meteorological satellites to reclassify the castellanus as a cloud genus at the same level as a cumulus or a cirrus. Corfidi has long criticized the resistance from official bodies to this change. However, the 2016 version of the International Cloud Atlas will not change the status of the castellanus. The same scientists have a similar opinion about lenticular clouds that can exist at different levels that are not recognized as a full cloud genus but only as a species."]}]}}
