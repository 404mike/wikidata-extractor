In the 1950s, on a visit to Russia with his first wife, Cherry Marshall, and her fashion show, Litvinoff became aware of the plight of persecuted Soviet Jews, and started a worldwide campaign against this persecution. One of his methods was editing the newsletter Jews in Eastern Europe and also lobbying eminent figures of the twentieth century such as Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, and others to join the campaign. Due to Litvinoff's efforts, prominent Jewish groups in the United States became aware of the issue, and the well-being of Soviet Jews became cause for a worldwide campaign, eventually leading to the mass migration of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel and the United States. For this he has been described by Meir Rosenne, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, as \"one of the greatest unsung heroes of the twentieth century... who won in the fight against an evil empire\" and that \"thousands and thousands of Russian Jews owe him their freedom\"."]}, {"page": "Paulene Stone", "response": ["Born in Guildford, she left school at the age of 16 to work in central London, commuting daily from her home in Goring-by-Sea.
