He was born in the Netherlands and became a British citizen.\nShe, with her husband, ran galleries in London, Brighton and Derbyshire and was known for encouraging many young artists and sculptors. In the 1920s she bought many works by Henry Moore and encouraged Cedric Morris.In 1930 she opened her first gallery at 3-5 Burlington Gardens, Mayfair, London. It has been suggested that it was the artist Frances Hodgkins who finally persuaded or perhaps goaded Mrs Wertheim to move from enthusiastic supporter of 'modern art' to a fully fledged gallery owner. Wertheim recalls the incident in her 1947 book 'Adventure in Art' - \"Frances exclaimed to my husband, 'Your wife should open a gallery for us poor artists: her enthusiasm would make it a success!'...Those words however spoken more than half in jest, sowed a seed in my mind that was to bear fruit later.\"Whatever finally got her to open the gallery, there were many artists who were no doubt glad she did. Those either exhibited there or supported by Wertheim included Walter Sickert, Rodney Gladwell, Humphrey Slater, Helmut Kolle, Vivin Hume, Phelan Gibb, John Bigge and John Banting, Henry Stockley, Nando Manetti, Rowland Suddaby, Leslie Hurry, Isla Rodmell, Kenneth Hall, Basil Rakoczi, John Melville, Feliks Topolski, Charles Higgins (Pic), David Burton, Cedric Morris, Alfred Wallis, Frances Hodgkins, Elizabeth Rivers, Mostyn Lewis, Jose Christopherson, David Gommon, Kathleen Walne and  Christopher Wood amongst many others.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Auckland Art Gallery", "response": ["Another major benefactor was Lucy Carrington Wertheim. Miss Wertheim was an art gallery owner in London and through her support of expatriate artist Frances Hodgkins bestowed on the Auckland Art Gallery a representative collection of British paintings from the interwar period. Her gifts in 1948 and 1950 totalled 154 works by modern British artists, including Christopher Wood, Frances Hodgkins, Phelan Gibb, R. O. Dunlop and Alfred Wallis. The Wertheim collection was initially displayed in a separate room opened by the Mayor J. A. C. Allum on 2 December 1948."]}, {"page": "Henry Stockley", "response": ["Stockley's work first attracted public interest when he was exhibited in a one man show by Lucy Wertheim at her Gallery in Burlington Gardens.  These paintings were principally concerned with scenes from The Pilgrim's Progress; the artist was named as Busdriver' Stockley. Lucy Carrington Wertheim, wife of Paul Wertheim, the Dutch Consul in Manchester, was already interested in naive art, as she called it, and was collecting work by Wallis and Vivin [Hume, 1992; Wertheim, 1947:26]. Her encounter with Henry Stockley is memorably told in her autobiography, Adventure in Art [Wertheim, 1947:37\u201338]: "]}, {"page": "David Gommon", "response": ["David Gommon was born on 12 December 1913 in Battersea in South London. His father was a Londoner, a journeyman carpenter.  At the age of 16 he was enrolled in Battersea Polytechnic and the Clapham School of Art. He was able to visit art galleries of the Netherlands to study the paintings of the great masters.  He met art collector, Lucy Carrington Wertheim and, when he was 18-19, she became his patron paying \u00a32 a week for his work."]}]}}
