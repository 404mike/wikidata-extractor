This was attended by Cabinet Ministers Asquith, Haldane, McKenna, Churchill, Grey, Lloyd George, as well as Nicholson (CIGS), French (the likely commander of the BEF) and Wilson representing the Army, and Sir Arthur Wilson (First Sea Lord) and Alexander Bethell (Director of Naval Intelligence). Admiral Wilson gave a poor account of himself, proposing that 5 divisions guard Britain whilst one land on the Baltic coast, or possibly at Antwerp, believing that the Germans would be halfway to Paris by the time an Expeditionary Force was ready, and that the four to six divisions Britain was expected to be able to muster would have little effect in a war with 70-80+ divisions on each side. Wilson thought the Royal Navy plan \"one of the most childish papers I ever read\".Jeffery 2006, pp. 96\u20137. Henry Wilson set out his own plans, apparently the first time the CID had heard them. Hankey recorded that Wilson's lucid presentation carried the day even though Hankey himself did not entirely agree with it. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army's plans, although he preferred to send only four divisions. Hankey also recorded that even by 1914 French and Haig were not fully aware of what had been decided, Morley and Burns resigned from the Cabinet as they were unable to accept the decision, and Churchill and Lloyd George never fully accepted the implications of committing a large military force to France. After the meeting Hankey began to draw up the War Book detailing mobilisation plans, and yet the exact deployment of the BEF was still undecided as late as 4 August 1914."]}, {"page": "5th Battle Squadron", "response": ["|3||Vice-Admiral || 25px ||Sir Alexander Bethell||17 January 1915 - 25 August 1915 ||and as Vice-Admiral Commanding, Channel Fleet"]}, {"page": "1855 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 28 August \u2013 Alexander Bethell, admiral (died 1932)."]}, {"page": "1932 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 13 June \u2013 Alexander Bethell, admiral (born 1855)"]}, {"page": "6th Battle Squadron", "response": ["|1||Vice-Admiral || 25px ||Sir Alexander Bethell||15 July 1913||as 6BS 2FL"]}, {"page": "East Indies Station", "response": ["|20 ||Rear-Admiral || 25px ||Alexander Bethell||(1912-1913)"]}, {"page": "Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service", "response": ["From 1782 until 1909, British intelligence at the government level was handled directly by the Foreign Office, with the Army and Navy also maintaining their own intelligence branches. By 1909, growing tensions with Germany led the Committee of Imperial Defence to recommend the creation of the Secret Service Bureau to provide organization and leadership to the intelligence-gathering process as well as a layer of insulation from espionage activities for the Foreign Office. A 10 August 1909 letter from the Director of Naval Intelligence, Alexander Bethell, to then-Commander Mansfield Smith-Cumming offered him a \"new billet\": the opportunity to head the Foreign Section of the new Secret Service Bureau. Cumming was to begin in this role on 1 October 1909, but bureaucratic and funding obstacles delayed the start of his work. His first full day in this capacity was not until 7 October, and even then, he \"went to the office and remained all day, but saw no one, nor was there anything to do there.\""]}, {"page": "Bethell", "response": ["*Alexander Bethell (1855\u20131932), Royal Navy officer who went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth"]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth", "response": ["*1916 \u2013 1918 Admiral Sir Alexander Bethell"]}, {"page": "June 1932", "response": ["*Died: Alexander Bethell, 76, British admiral"]}]}}
