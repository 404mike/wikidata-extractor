He was released from prison on 6 June 2012. He returned to football playing on non-contract terms for Truro City in November 2012, before returning to league football on 31 January 2013 with Oxford United. He was released at the end of the 2012\u201313 season and, in May 2013, re-signed for Plymouth Argyle on a one-year contract. In July 2014, McCormick was assigned the role of 'club captain' at Plymouth Argyle (although the current captain was Curtis Nelson). In August 2016, McCormick became captain of the club after Nelson joined Oxford United. He left Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 2018 season after making 347 appearances for the club. In the summer of 2018 he signed for Swindon Town on a free deal. He went on to make 29 league appearances for the club and played as backup to Steven Benda as the club won the League Two title in 2019\u201320.

He was sentenced to seven years and four months prison time in October of that year.", "The family of the bereaved took offence at Norris' gesture and he was subsequently fined and warned by Ipswich. He was once again caught out when he told the Ipswich website he had not intended the celebration as a show of support to Luke McCormick and the statement was later changed by the club, adding further to the controversy. The statement now reads that the celebration was in fact a message to Luke McCormick.

The 2013\u201314 season was a more successful one on the pitch for Argyle, and during it Argyle re-signed Luke McCormick and so Cole found himself as the club's back-up goalkeeper, only for injuries to McCormick to see him play exactly the same number of times as McCormick that year.
