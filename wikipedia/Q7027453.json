Two Starlord strips strengthened 2000 AD's line-up: Strontium Dog, a mutant bounty hunter created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and Ro-Busters, a robot disaster squad created by Mills. Ro-Busters gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off ABC Warriors. Strontium Dog and ABC Warriors continued to feature in 2000 AD for the next 40 years. (A third Starlord series, Timequake, only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) Dan Dare was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to Dredd following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane Chief Judge Cal, based on the Roman emperor Caligula.", "#Kelvin Gosnell, #17\u201385 (1977\u20131978)Kelvin Gosnell at 2000ad.orgAssistant editor Nick Landau largely edited the comic himself in 1978 while Gosnell was occupied with editing new sister title Starlord."]}, {"page": "Brian Bolland", "response": ["In 1972, Bolland attended the British Comic Art Convention at the Waverley Hotel in London, and met \"a lot of the people who were key in the comics scene of the time,\" including Dez Skinn, Nick Landau, Richard Burton, Angus McKie and \u2013 crucially \u2013 Dave Gibbons.Bolland, \"1970s \u2013 Powerman\" in The Art of Brian Bolland, p. 37 Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with \"the stark reality of unemployment\" and on the advice of GibbonsSalisbury, p. 13 joined art agency Bardon Press Features. \"A few two-page strips\" for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his \"lowest time.\" Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was \"planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero,\" Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that \"soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages.\" This knowledge \u2013 \"that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I was going to have to do the same\" \u2013 was a shock, but proved to be \"the very best kind of training ground.\" With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be \"really simple; six panels on a page and [all] the panels had to be numbered.\" Not only was this work \"[t]he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling,\" but \"better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it.\" He \"drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that.\"Salisbury, p. 12 Even so, he \"was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished,\" and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his \"Norwich School of Art days,\" Gibbons and future-2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O'Neill.Bolland, \"The 1970s \u2013 Help from Friends\" in The Art of Brian Bolland, p. 42", "Other covers following (nearly a third of the first 30), as well as stand-alone pages and some inking duties on Gibbons' Dan Dare.

Bolland contributed artwork to such Judge Dredd story-arcs as \"Luna Period\", \"The Cursed Earth\", \"The Day the Law Died\", \"The Judge Child Quest\" and \"Block Mania\". As the Dredd stories rose in popularity, they \"were moved so they started on the middle pages\" with a colour double-page spread, which Bolland \"always struggled with\"Bolland, \"The 1970s \u2013 The Muties Mountain Double Page Spread\" in The Art of Brian Bolland, p. 76 finding it \"very difficult...

Landau spent time paginating the book at Bolland's flat, and discovered that \"[s]ome stories started or ended on the wrong page thereby leaving blank pages,\" as it was set to be \"in effect, the first book exclusively of my work\" the artist \"gladly offered to add three full page pictures for the Cursed Earth volume and a new back cover for the first Judge Dredd volume.Bolland, \"The 1980s \u2013 Titan Books\" in The Art of Brian Bolland, p. 124", "From the 1970s to the present, Bolland has also produced one-off pieces of artwork for use as record (including one for The Drifters in 1975Bolland, \"The 1970s \u2013 The Drifters\" in The Art of Brian Bolland, pp. 44\u201345), paperback book (including the UK Titan editions of George R.
