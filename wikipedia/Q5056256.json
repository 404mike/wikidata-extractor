The company soon expanded into aircraft repairs and then split into two separate operations: the Southern Aero Club and Southern Aircraft. One of the aircraft Miles acquired was an Avro Baby, which he modified to turn it into an aerobatic sports aircraft he called the Southern Martlet. Miles was later joined as a director in both companies by Magnus Herman Volk, the eldest son of Magnus Volk, who from an early age, had a keen interest in aviation."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* Cecil Pashley (1891\u20141961), aviation pioneer"]}]}}
