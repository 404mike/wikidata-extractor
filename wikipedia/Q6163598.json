After three defeats the Vale then entered a long period of inconsistent form. In September, Darrell Clarke joined on loan from Hartlepool United, though he would play just the one game for the club. Gary Mulligan also arrived on loan from Sheffield United, and would find greater success in Burslem. The next month Foyle added to the squad by signing Michael Husbands from Walsall. In November, Sam Togwell joined on loan from Scunthorpe United, in an initial six week deal that was extended until the end of the season. Another long-term loan deal was struck with Leyton Orient for big defender Clayton Fortune, who would later turn down a permanent transfer to Vale Park after failing to agree on personal terms. Foyle also made possibly the best signing of his spell in charge at Vale, bringing striker Leon Constantine in from Torquay United for a \u00a320,000 fee. However Foyle lost two big players, when key defender Sam Collins and promising striker Billy Paynter were sold to Hull City for \u00a365,000 and \u00a3150,000 respectively, the pair leaving on loan deals until the January transfer window (when they would leave permanently). Four straight defeats followed this, emphasising the effect the sales had on the club's promotion bid. In January, Bell moved on to Cheltenham Town, and Hector Sam joined Walsall. In came Jason Talbot on loan from Mansfield Town, who joined the club permanently at the end of the season. Foyle also signed defender Mark McGregor from Blackpool, and midfielder Sean Doherty from ADO Den Haag.
