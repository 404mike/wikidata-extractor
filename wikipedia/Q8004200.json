During the 19th century, English archaeologist Austen Henry Layard believed that the native Christian communities in the historical region of Assyria were descended from the ancient Assyrians, a view that was also shared by William Ainger Wigram. Although at the same time Horatio Southgate and George Thomas Bettany claimed during their travels through Mesopotamia that the Syriac Christians are the descendants of the Arameans."]}, {"page": "Millet (Ottoman Empire)", "response": ["In a 1910 book William Ainger Wigram used the term melet in application to the Persian Sassanid Empire, arguing that the situation there was similar to the Ottoman millet system and no other term was readily available to describe it. Some other authors have also adopted this usage. The early Christians there were forming the Church of the East (later known as the Nestorian Church after the Nestorian schism). The Church of the East's leader, the Catholicos or Patriarch of the East, was responsible to the Persian king for the Christians within the Empire. This system of maintaining the Christians as a protected religious community continued after the Islamic conquest of the Sassanids, and the community of Nestorian Christians flourished and was able to send missionaries far past the Empire's borders, reaching as far as China and India."]}, {"page": "Qudshanis", "response": ["In a relatively isolated area, Qodshanis was for many years cut off from the outside world up until 1829, when a German traveller discovered it.

A Nestorian community at Bebadi is attested in the 10th-century Life of Rabban Joseph Busnaya. The village was visited by the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in the late 1840s. In 1850, 20 Nestorian families inhabited Bebadi, and had one priest and one functioning church as part of the diocese of Berwari. The Anglican missionary William Ainger Wigram established a school in the village in 1908.

A recently discovered list of Qudshanis patriarchs compiled after the First World War by the bishop Eliya of Alqosh, however, gives a completely different set of dates:  Shemon X (1600\u201339); Shemon XI (1639\u201353); Shemon XII (1653\u201392); Shemon XIII Denha (1692\u20131700); and Shemon XIV Shlemun (1700\u201317).
