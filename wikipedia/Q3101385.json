In about 1924 it became known as the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship (Crotona was the site of Pythagoras\u2019s school in southern Italy). As a journalist, playwright and actor George Alexander Sullivan used the name Alex Mathews; in the context of his mystical activities he used the name Frater Aureolis. From 1925-1928 he put out a periodical, The Rosicrucian Gazette. The ROCF operated first from Liverpool area of England and then from the mid-1930s onwards from the Christchurch area.\nThe group\u2019s headquarters was a wooden building called the Ashrama Hall, completed in 1936 on the grounds of Catherine Chalk\u2019s house on Somerford Road near Christchurch, England. Peter Caddy became one of Sullivan\u2019s disciples in 1936, introduced by his then brother-in-law Cyril \u201cJim\u201d Barnes. In the light of future developments at the Findhorn Foundation, it's interesting to note that Sullivan's disciples began to buy bungalows close by his Ashrama Hall.\nWith Mabel Besant-Scott, George Alexander Sullivan organized a rosicrucian theatre company. In 1938, also on Catherine Chalk's land, they built Christchurch Garden Theatre, which called itself \u201cThe First Rosicrucian Theater in England.\u201d It presented Sullivan's mystically-themed plays during June\u2013September 1938. Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), the reviver of British witchcraft (\u201cWicca\u201d), claimed to have been initiated into traditional witchcraft through contacts he made at the rosicrucian theatre, though there is some debate about this. Gerald Gardner\u2019s biography by Jack Bracelin (although said by Frederic Lamond to have been written by Idries Shah) mentions the group. Although the group named itself after the Rosicrucian tradition, and although its rituals had a Masonic flavour to them, the teachings of George Alexander Sullivan \u2014 at least as given by Peter Caddy \u2014 resemble most of all the teachings of the New Thought movement.

Following the death of George Alexander Sullivan in 1942, the group's activities and membership diminished. By the early 1950s their focus had moved to Southampton. Correspondence between former members suggests the Order 'existed in memory only' by the early 1970s.

In 1933 she visited India where her mother died and met the Avatar Meher Baba, where they discussed her mother resurrecting as a man in India. She wrote several articles for The Aydar Bulletin, a periodical of the Theosophical Society based in Adyar, India. A year later she abruptly resigned from Co-Freemasonry, joining the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship shortly afterwards and taking with her some of her followers from Co-Masonry.

Woodford-Grimes decided to move away from Southampton, and so relocated to Christchurch, Hampshire by 1938. Here she purchased a newly built bungalow in Dennistoun Avenue, Somerford, and began working as a private teacher of elocution and dramatic art.Heselton 2000. p. 124. It was at her new home in Christchurch that she became involved in a local esoteric group, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship. Becoming increasingly interested in their philosophies and practices, she decided to name her bungalow \"Theano\", which had been the name of the wife of the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras. Woodford-Grimes herself had performed the role of Theano in a play about Pythagoras that the Crotona Fellowship had put on, and which had been written by the group's leader, George Alexander Sullivan."]}, {"page": "New Forest coven", "response": ["Gerald Gardner claimed that after moving to the borough of Christchurch, Dorset in 1939, he got involved with the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, an occult organisation based upon Rosicrucianism. However, he was largely dissatisfied with the Order, and in particular its leader, George Alexander Sullivan, believing them to be devoid of any genuine esoteric knowledge. Meanwhile, he met a group of people within the Fellowship who claimed to have been involved in a form of Freemasonry known as Co-Masonry, who informed him that they had moved to the area where they had joined the Rosicrucian Order when their friend and fellow Co-Mason, Mabel Besant-Scott, had done so.Bracelin 1960. pp. 164\u2013166. The researcher Philip Heselton identified two of these individuals as Ernest and Susie Mason, a brother and sister couple who had in prior decades been involved in a variety of occult groups, including Co-Masonry and Theosophy, and who had recently moved to the area from Southampton.Heselton 2000. pp. 100\u2013112.

It presented mystically-themed plays, written by George Alexander Sullivan under his journalistic pen-name Alex Matthews. Among the Rosicrucian Players was a small group who formed a coven of witches (New Forest coven). Gerald Gardner, a retired colonial civil servant, joined them after moving to Highcliffe in 1938. Gardner went on to take a leading role in the modern revival of witchcraft - often referred to as Wicca. The theatre was never popular and closed shortly after Sullivan\u2019s death in 1942. It was then used as a training centre for de Havilland. The theatre was destroyed by fire in 1975.Christchurch Garden TheatreRosicrucian Collection (Special Collections)"]}]}}
