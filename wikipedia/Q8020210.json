Born in Birmingham in 1863 he played five first-class matches for Marylebone Cricket Club, scoring 182 runs at 26 with a highest score of 74 against Lancashire. A right arm quick bowler, he also took five wickets at just 20 apiece. He stood in the match between North and South in 1890 and continued to umpire for the next 45 years, until his final season in 1935. He officiated in nine Test matches, from his first England v Australia test in 1896 to the 1912 Triangular Tournament featuring England, Australia and South Africa. He died in Northampton in 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Mold", "response": ["During the 1900 season, Fry was once more no-balled at the beginning of June, this time by William West. The concerted action against throwing reached a peak when Phillips umpired the match between Nottinghamshire and Lancashire in Nottingham on 26 June. Early on the first morning of the three-day match, Mold came on to bowl when Nottinghamshire had scored 34. In Mold's first over, Phillips twice no-balled him for throwing. Lancashire's captain, Archie MacLaren, withdrew Mold from the bowling attack at the end of the over and he did not bowl again in the match. However, MacLaren later defended Mold in the press. The match reports in both The Times and Wisden commented that Mold had been lucky never to be no-balled before in his career; he was the most high-profile bowler to be called in the Phillips-led crackdown on bowling actions.Brodribb, p. 157. Mold played another nine times in 1900 without being called for throwing, but he did not play in any of the Lancashire matches umpired by Phillips. Later in the season, Phillips called the Somerset bowler Ted Tyler. By the end of the season, Mold had taken 97 wickets at 14.01."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|William West||||9||1896||1912"]}, {"page": "William West", "response": ["William West may refer to:", "*William West (artist) (1801\u20131861), English artist (of Bristol)", "*William West (director) of Flying Wild", "*William West Anderson (1928\u20132017), birth name of American actor Adam West", "*William West (actor) (1856\u20131915), American actor", "*William West (Rhode Island politician) (c. 1733\u20131816), American militia general in the American Revolutionary War and later political leader", "*William West, 1st Baron De La Warr (c. 1520\u20131595), British political figure", "*William West (legal writer) (c. 1548\u20131598), English lawyer, known as the author of Symbol\u00e6ographia", "*William West (1612\u20131670), English politician", "*William West (chemist) (1792\u20131851), English chemist of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society", "*William West (botanist) (1848\u20131914), British botanist", "*William West (sailor) (born 1931), Canadian Olympic sailor", "*William West (umpire) (1863\u20131938), cricketer and test match umpire", "*William West (equestrian) (1887\u20131953), American equestrian", "*William West (wrestler), British Olympic wrestler"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* William West (1888\u20131891) : W.
