He studied at the Royal Academy of Music under Frederick Corder (composition) and Lionel Tertis (viola), and played in string quartets and theatre pit bands, before joining symphony orchestras conducted by Thomas Beecham and Henry Wood. Coates's experience as a player added to the rigorous training he had received at the academy and contributed to his skill as a composer.\nWhile still working as a violist, Coates composed songs and other light musical works. In 1919 he gave up the viola permanently and from then until his death he made his living as a composer and occasional conductor. His prolific output includes the London Suite (1932), of which the well-known \"Knightsbridge March\" is the concluding section; the waltz \"By the Sleepy Lagoon\" (1930); and \"The Dam Busters March\" (1954). His early compositions were influenced by the music of Arthur Sullivan and Edward German, but Coates's style evolved in step with changes in musical taste, and his later works incorporate elements derived from jazz and dance-band music. His output consists almost wholly of orchestral music and songs. With the exception of one unsuccessful short ballet, he never wrote for the theatre, and only occasionally for the cinema.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 21", "response": ["*1957 \u2013 Eric Coates, English-American viola player and composer (b. 1886)"]}, {"page": "1957", "response": ["* December 21 \u2013 Eric Coates, English composer (b. 1886)"]}, {"page": "1886", "response": ["** Eric Coates, English composer (d. 1957)"]}, {"page": "London (disambiguation)", "response": ["*London, suite by Eric Coates (1886-1957)"]}, {"page": "Annie Hall", "response": ["*\"Sleepy Lagoon\" (1930) - Composed by Eric Coates - Performed by Tommy Dorsey"]}, {"page": "Lionel Tertis", "response": ["Many fine English violists were students of Tertis, including Rebecca Clarke, Eric Coates, Winifred Copperwheat, Paul Cropper, Harry Danks, C.

Waltzes nevertheless continued to be written by composers of light music, such as Eric Coates, Robert Stolz, Ivor Novello, Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter, Oscar Straus, and Stephen Sondheim. The Australian composer Julian Cochran composed piano and orchestral works using the French title Valses, closer to the Latin origin, to mitigate assumptions of a Viennese style. The predominant ballroom form in the 20th century has become the slow waltz, which rose to popularity around 1910 and was derived from the valse Boston of the 1870s. Examples derived from popular songs include \"Ramona\" (1927), \"Parlami d\u2019amore, Mari\u00f9\" (1933), and \"The Last Waltz\" (1970)."]}]}}
