Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film \"has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop.\" The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film \"Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film was \"glib, shallow, and monotonous\" and \"reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America.\""]}, {"page": "Buster Keaton", "response": ["Film critic David Thomson later described Keaton's style of comedy: \"Buster plainly is a man inclined towards a belief in nothing but mathematics and absurdity ... like a number that has always been searching for the right equation.

The journalist Mark Harris writes that she specialises in \"unsentimentalized, restless, troubled, discontented, disconcerted, difficult women\" and John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph has identified a theme of characters who are free-spirited with a sexual edge to them. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker associates Winslet with stubbornness, writing that \"the set of her jaw and the blaze of her glance suggest a self-freeing spirit who knows the path ahead and is determined to take it\". Stephen Whitty of NJ.com associates Winslet with \"serious, almost despairing material\", although he finds it hard to pigeonhole her as an actress.

Although most critics agreed that the ensemble cast was underused, Pfeiffer's performance earned positive reviews, with Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times opining that the actress delivers the film's best performance. The New Yorker's Anthony Lane found Pfeiffer to be the only actor who appears to be enjoying their material. David Edelstein of Vulture described the actress as \"a hoot and a half ... stealing every scene\".
