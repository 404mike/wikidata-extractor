Her sketches caught the eye of Disney, so when the film went into production she was assigned to animate scenes of hunting dogs chasing Faline. She worked under the film's supervising director, David D. Hand, and was tutored by Disney animator Eric Larson. This was a significant coup for the young woman, since at the 1930s-era Disney studio, women were considered only for routine tasks: \"Ink and paint art was a laborious part of the animation process, and was solely the domain of women...\"from a brief history of another Disney female pioneer, Evelyn Henry Coats (1910\u20132009).  The website also contains a Disney Personnel Department form letter used to explain to female applicants that animation as such was reserved for men.
