He introduced video-cysto-urethrography.\nAfter studying medicine at Oriel College, Oxford, where he was president of its boat club during the year that it won The Boat Race, he completed his pre-clinical training at the Middlesex Hospital. During the 1950s he rotated through several medical and surgical specialties including urology with Sir Eric Riches and Sir David Innes Williams at the Institute of Urology in London. In 1958 he won the Leopold Hudson Travelling Fellowship that enabled him to be appointed to a research position at Colombia Presbyterian Delafield Hospital. Subsequently he became one of six consultant general surgeons to the Middlesex Hospital, where he also looked after the thyroid clinic and developed his trephine biopsy instrument. In 1963, he took over the hospital's urological department, succeeding Sir Eric.\nIn 1977 Turner-Warwick was elected to be the Hunterian Professor of the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Richard Turner-Warwick, formerly Senior Surgeon and Urologist to The Middlesex and St Peters Hospitals and Hunterian Professor Royal College of Surgeons"]}, {"page": "Margaret Turner-Warwick", "response": ["She married urologist Richard Turner-Warwick (born 1925) in 1950.
