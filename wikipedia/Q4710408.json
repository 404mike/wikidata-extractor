They did not lose a single match and managed to win fifteen out of nineteen games in which a ball was actually bowled. This is the highest proportion of wins by an undefeated side and the third highest proportion of wins in County Championship history \u2013 and the two higher figures were in very dry summers with almost no rain interruptions.\nHallam was, at Nottinghamshire, the successor to the more famous Alfred Shaw and William Attewell. He was a slow bowler with extreme accuracy of pitch who could flight the ball with great skill and turn the ball both ways. He had few pretensions as a batsman, but his innings of 46 at The Oval against Surrey was critical to Nottinghamshire remaining unbeaten for the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1907 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Albert Hallam, Reggie Schwarz, Frank Tarrant, Bert Vogler, Thomas Wass"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Albert Hallam"]}, {"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The formal creation of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club was enacted in March or April 1841 (the exact date has been lost). William Clarke established Trent Bridge as a cricket venue adjacent to the public house he ran. It was Clarke's successor as Nottinghamshire captain, George Parr, who first captained a united England touring team in 1859.  The club elected its first president, Sir Henry Bromley, in 1869. Early professional greats such as Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury ensured that Notts were a force in the period before 1900. Thanks largely to the outstanding bowling combination of Tom Wass and Albert Hallam, the county won the County Championship in 1907 when George Gunn, John Gunn and Wilfred Payton were also prominent."]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Lancashire won its first county championship in 1897, a productive bowling attack made up of Johnny Briggs, Willis Cuttell, Albert Hallam, and Arthur Mold took 420\u00a0wickets between them. In 1898 Lancashire bought the ground and some adjoining land from the de Traffords for \u00a324,732 (\u00a3 in ). In 1902, amateur and professional players began walking onto the field side by side in a break with tradition. Lancashire won its second championship title in 1904, going undefeated throughout the season; Wisden described the season as \u201cthe brightest in the history of Lancashire cricket\u201d. That season, James Hallows completed the feat of 1,000\u00a0runs and 100\u00a0wickets in the season. During the late 1900s and early 1910s, players such as Walter Brearley, Harry Dean, and Bill Huddleston were the mainstays of Lancashire bowling. The club began to experience financial problems during this same period; the increased popularity of other sports was blamed for the dip in attendances. In 1914, Lancashire sank to its lowest position of eleventh, whilst during World War I the pavilion was used by the Red Cross and 1,800 patients were treated there."]}, {"page": "Schofield Haigh", "response": ["Called to the Test side with a sticky wicket expected in 1905, Haigh had a surprising off-day and was not picked again until 1909. He came close to heading the national averages for five successive seasons \u2013 being only shaded out by Albert Hallam in 1907, in which year he took 13 for 40 against Warwickshire. Yorkshire bowlers such as Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were utilised in longer spells with Haigh benefiting later on. After a poor season in 1910, Haigh returned to form in 1911 and 1912. His 96 wickets for 11.41 was decisive in Yorkshire's County Championship win, but another unsuccessful Test appearance, and that he then aged forty-one made him decide to move into coaching at the end of 1913. He did retain his place for Yorkshire primarily as a batsman with a long series of useful \u2013 though never large innings, whilst his bowling lapsed into decline."]}, {"page": "Thomas Wass", "response": ["Thomas George Wass (26 December 1873 \u2013 27 October 1953), known as Tom Wass, was a Nottinghamshire bowler who is best remembered, along with Albert Hallam, for bowling that gave Nottinghamshire a brilliant County Championship win in 1907.
