In the Billiard Room, a mural of St Cecilia, painted by Mary Adshead, features a lemur perched on the ledge between two painted columns. Jongy is featured in carved wooden roof bosses in the north bay of the Great Hall. In Leonard Campbell Taylor's portrait of the Courtaulds in the music room of their London townhouse (47 Grosvenor Square), Jongy sits next to Virginia, on the arm of her chair. Jongy's memorial consisted of a banded obelisk (in imitation of his tail) and a lead relief of the lemur. It was initially located at Eltham Palace but is now at the Courtaulds\u2019 last home, La Rochelle in Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Leonard Campbell Taylor"]}, {"page": "Thetis Blacker", "response": ["Blacker was born in Holmbury St Mary, Surrey, England.

Blacker intended to be a singer and studied with the German mezzo-soprano singer Elena Gerhardt in London. She appeared in the chorus at Glyndebourne opera in the 1950s and sang the role of \"Mother Goose\" in The Rake's Progress by Igor Stravinsky. When her singing career was cut short by vocal issues in the mid-1950s, Blacker turned her focus to painting. She studied at the Chelsea School of Art in London and was taught by the wife of the artist Leonard Campbell Taylor, Brenda Moore."]}, {"page": "Leonard Taylor", "response": ["* Leonard Campbell Taylor (1874\u20131969), British painter"]}]}}
