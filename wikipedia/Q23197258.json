After her marriage, she moved to South Africa, where she became one of the most recognisable feminists in the Cape Colony. Advocating for suffrage, she co-founded the Cape Branch of the Women's Enfranchisement League (WEL), the first organisation in South Africa created to push for women's right to vote. Active as a pacifist, she was against both the Second Boer War and World War I, but believed that the Nazis must be stopped at all cost. She was also active in many social reform programs and was part of the purity movement. For her work on the National Council of Women, she was awarded the King George Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Seaforth, Merseyside", "response": ["* Julia Solly (1862\u20131953), British-born South-African feminist"]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["*Julia Solly (1862\u20131953) \u2013 British-born South African feminist and suffragist who helped acquire the vote for white women in 1930"]}, {"page": "Max Muspratt", "response": ["He was born at Seaforth Hall, Seaforth, Lancashire, the son of Edmund Knowles Muspratt and his wife Frances Jane Baines.
