Born in Norwich, where he lived for most of his life, he was a leading member of the Norwich School of painters.\nMuch of Thirtle's life is undocumented. After working as an apprentice to a London frame-maker, he returned to Norwich to establish his own frame-making business. During his career he also worked as a drawing-master, a printseller and a looking glass maker. He produced frames for paintings by several members of the Norwich School, including John Crome and John Sell Cotman. Throughout his working life he continued to paint. In 1812 he married Elizabeth Miles, the sister of Cotman's wife Ann. Thirtle suffered from tuberculosis during the last two decades of his life, and his worsening health reduced his artistic output up to his death in 1839. His unpublished manuscript Treatise on Watercolour was probably for his own use, and he exhibited fewer than 100 paintings. A member of the Norwich Society of Artists, he briefly served as its vice-president, but in 1816 was one of the artists who seceded from the Society to form a separate association, the Norfolk and Norwich Society of Artists, which dissolved after three years.\nThe majority of Thirtle's watercolours are of Norwich and the surrounding Norfolk countryside, many being riverside scenes. His style, influenced by Thomas Girtin, Crome and (to a lesser extent) Cotman, was technically accomplished. His earlier landscapes were painted with a restricted range of buffs, blues and grey-browns, but he later developed a brilliancy of colour, producing works that included angular block forms. The quality of several of his watercolours has deteriorated owing to the fading of the indigo pigment that he used extensively.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Sell Cotman", "response": ["He moved to London in 1798, and lived at 28, Gerrard Street, Soho, initially making a living through commissions from print-sellers, and his sketches at Rudulph Ackerman's print shop at 96, The Strand were studied by the artist John Thirtle when a young man. He first came under the patronage of Dr. Thomas Munro, physician to the Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, whose house in Adelphi Terrace was a studio and a meeting place for artists, including the young J. M. W. Turner. There Cotman may have made the acquaintance of Turner, Peter de Wint and Thomas Girtin, who became an influential figure in his artistic development. The historian William Frederick Dickes stated in The Norwich School of Painting that, even though evidence is lacking, Cotman may possibly joined the sketching club started by Girtin. During the summer of 1799 he went on a drawing expedition with him to Surrey, and the following spring they went on a sketching trip to Wales."]}, {"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["File:Devil's Tower near King Street Gates - Evening.jpg|John Thirtle, Devil's Tower near King Street Gates \u2013 Evening (undated), Norfolk Museums Collections", "*John Thirtle"]}, {"page": "Joseph Stannard", "response": ["In 1816, Stannard, Robert Ladbrooke and his sons, James Sillett and John Thirtle seceded from the Norwich Society of Artists to form their own society. Led by Ladbrooke, seven members of the Norwich Society opened an exhibition entitled 'The Twelfth of the Norfolk and Norwich Society of Artists', which was held in the Shakespeare Tavern, on Theatre Plain. Stannard exhibited five works in the first year of the new society's existence: Study from Nature; Distant View of Norwich from Whitlingham;.Pencil Sketches; View of the Foundry Bridge and View of the City from Fuller's Hole, exhibiting 13 works with the society in total.

These works have more descriptive titles. Not all his critics were pleased: the Norfolk Chronicle complained in 1829 of Stark's move away from depicting formulaic scenes towards a greater use of bright colours and more brilliant lighting effects. His work during this period in his artistic career became more successful, according to Hemingway. The numerous sketches of the Norfolk countryside he had previously produced gave his exhibited works a freshness that was previously lacking, and which was more appealing to the critics. Cromer, exhibited at the British Institution in 1837, is a good example of this new kind of work, and shows the influence of his friend William Collins and the Norwich artist John Thirtle. Like many of his later works, it is based on earlier sketchwork."]}, {"page": "George Vincent (painter)", "response": ["* Trowse Meadows, near Norwich (1828), Norwich Museums Collections.
