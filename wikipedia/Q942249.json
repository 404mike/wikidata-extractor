Born in Pontypridd, Wales, he was nicknamed the \"Welsh Wizard\". Brought up in a tough mining community, Welsh left a working-class background to make a name for himself in America. He turned professional as a boxer in Philadelphia in 1905, and spent the best part of his career fighting in the United States.\nWelsh spent much of his career chasing the world championship title, held in turn by Battling Nelson, Ad Wolgast and Willie Ritchie, failing through a series of events to meet each until a successful encounter with Ritchie in July 1914, when he finally became world lightweight champion. Welsh held the title until 1917 when he lost to Benny Leonard, though he continued to fight sparingly until 1922. During his career, he fought in more than 160 professional bouts, suffering defeat on just 5 occasions.\nA keen follower of Bernarr Macfadden's physical culture, Welsh believed in exercise and healthy living and was a non-smoker and a vegetarian. In the years following the end of his career, bad business choices cost him his fortune, and after numerous health problems he died in poverty in 1927.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 5", "response": ["*  1886   \u2013 Freddie Welsh, Welsh boxer (d. 1927)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Freddie Welsh (1886\u20131927)"]}, {"page": "Glamorgan", "response": ["Of all the individual sports, arguably boxing was Glamorgan's most prolific.

Reflecting the sentiments of the perfect Jewish son, Leonard confided to the press, \"My mother deserves all the credit.  She always made me live right...tonight he (Welsh) showed more skill than I ever saw before...he is a game fellow.  I didn't know it was the ninth round when I went after him at the finish, but I knew the time was getting short...He is a brainy fighter but I know then that his brain wasn't in control. I've always been afraid of hitting a man who was helpless like that so I didn't hit him on the chin again, I hit him on the head, hoping he would go down.\"  Rather than a harsh blow, Leonard used a lighter one, hoping not to excessively injure his opponent.  Leonard displayed sportsmanship, humility, consideration for others, and the ability to articulate the qualities that endeared him to the Jewish community of New York, and made him a great draw and a role model to many of his fans.
