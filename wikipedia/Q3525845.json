But in fact, it was in 1901 when the first color film in history was created. This untitled film was directed by photographer Edward Raymond Turner and his patron Frederick Marshall Lee. The way they did it was to use black and white film rolls, but have green, red, and blue filters go over the camera individually as it shot. To complete the film, they joined the original footage and filters on a special projector. However, both the shooting of the film and its projection suffered from major unrelated issues that, eventually, sank the idea."]}, {"page": "Cinema of the United Kingdom", "response": ["In 1902 the earliest colour film in the world was made; like other films made at the time, it is of everyday events.

Retrieved 21 August 2016 British film production suffered in the 1920s in face of competition from American imports and a legal requirement for cinemas to show a set quota of British films, which encouraged poor-quality, low-cost productions to meet this demand. This had changed by the 1940s, when the government encouraged fewer, higher-quality films to be made.

These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color filters.", "A pioneering three-color additive system was patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899. It used a rotating set of red, green and blue filters to photograph the three color components one after the other on three successive frames of panchromatic black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format nitrate film copied to black-and-white 35\u00a0mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by telecine. Finally, digital image processing was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image.Pritchard, B. (2012). \"Lee-Turner Project with the National Media Museum\".

They utilized black-and-white film and rotating color filter wheels to record the amount of each color in the scene on alternating frames of the film, so that when the frames were projected by light of similar colors at a sufficiently rapid rate, those colors blended together in the color center of the viewer's occipital lobe, producing a wider range of hues.
