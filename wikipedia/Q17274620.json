His most successful season with the bat and in the field was 1953, when in 30 matches he scored 1227 runs at an average of 29.92 and took 46 catches. Of his performances that year Wisden remarked that he \"at last justified expectations with the bat and he brought exciting moments to many games by his extraordinary catches in the slips\".His highest score was 154 in the first match of the 1957 County Championship, made in just under five hours, against Worcestershire. His best innings bowling figures were 7 for 84 against Essex in 1949, a match that Essex nevertheless won by an innings. His best match bowling figures were 10 for 95 (6 for 67 and 4 for 28) against Cambridge University in 1957.He was awarded a benefit match in 1960, but he retired later that year after a season of moderate form.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 26 August \u2013 Alan Townsend, cricketer (died 2014)"]}, {"page": "Birmingham and District Premier League", "response": ["| Alan Townsend", "| Alan Townsend"]}, {"page": "List of Amherst College people", "response": ["*Alan Townsend 1988, current interim president of Colorado College"]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Alan Townsend 41"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Alan Townsend (1948\u20131960) : A.

His first century was an innings of 109 in the match against Hampshire at Edgbaston in July 1899, putting on 182 for the fourth wicket with Willie Quaife, though that partnership was overshadowed by the unbroken 194 that Quaife, who made 207, later put on with Alfred Glover in the same match. There were centuries in the next two seasons as well, and the unbeaten 140 that he made in the game against Derbyshire in 1901 proved to be the highest of his career: the 361 runs Warwickshire made in that innings came in just over 90 overs, a prodigious rate of scoring for the time, and Fishwick was known at the time as a fast scorer and a powerful hitter. He was less successful in 1902 and 1903 but had his best seasons with the bat in 1904 and 1905, passing 1,000 runs in these two years with the 1905 aggregate of 1440 runs at an average of 32.00 and with four centuries his best. Fewer matches in 1906 meant that his aggregate dropped, but his batting average of 41.77 for that season was his best in any single season. Thereafter his record fell away and he scored no more centuries. In addition to his batting, Fishwick was also a fine fielder at slip and the 40 catches he took for Warwickshire in 1905 (41 in all matches in the season) remained the county record until beaten by Alan Townsend in 1951."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2014", "response": ["*Alan Townsend, 92, English cricketer (Warwickshire).Alan Townsend 1921-2014"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Alan Townsend (1953) : A.
