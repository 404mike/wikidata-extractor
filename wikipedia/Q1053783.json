This excavation revealed most of the environmental evidence known about the site, including the remains of winged ants which indicate that Silbury was begun in an August. Atkinson dug numerous trenches at the site and reopened the 1849 tunnel, where he found material suggesting a Neolithic date, although none of his radiocarbon dates are considered reliable by modern standards. He argued that the hill was constructed in steps, each tier being filled in with packed chalk and then smoothed off or weathered into a slope. Atkinson reported the C 14 date for the base layer of turf and decayed material indicated a corrected date for the commencement of Silbury was close to 2750\u00a0BC.'Prehistoric Avebury' by Aubrey Burl, Yale University press, 1979, page 129"]}, {"page": "West Kennet Long Barrow", "response": ["A second excavation took place over the course of 1955 and 1956, overseen by Stuart Piggott and Richard J.
