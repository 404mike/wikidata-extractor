The solo show did not get the best ratings but was all in all still well received.

Betty Clarke of The Guardian described Doherty as \"focused\" and \"on good form\". Friend and collaborator Peter Wolfe had a guest appearance on stage when Doherty performed \"For Lovers\". Swaine stated Wolfe ruined the song with \"some especially tuneless backing vocals\". The gig was forced to an abrupt end during the encore due to a stage invasion by the fans."]}, {"page": "Ford Field", "response": ["| || Kid Rock || Ty StoneJamey Johnson || Born Free Tour || \u2014 || \u2014 || This concert was part of his 40th birthday party.
