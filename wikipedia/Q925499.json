This total includes 6 goals that he scored in 6 Inter-League matches for the Scottish League XI. McGrory is a legendary figure within Celtic's history. He is their top scorer of all time with 522 goals from 501 games, and holds their record for the most goals in a season, with 62 goals from 46 games in season 1927\u201328. He has also notched up a British top-flight record of 55 hat-tricks, 48 coming in League games and 7 from Scottish Cup ties. It could be argued he in fact scored 56, as he hit 8 goals in a Scottish League game against Dunfermline on 14 January 1928. This is also a British top-flight record.\nHe was at Celtic for 15 years between 1922 and 1937, although he did spend the majority of the 1923\u201324 season on loan at fellow Division One side Clydebank. After a spell managing Kilmarnock from December 1937 to July 1945, he became Celtic manager, where he remained for just under 20 years, until March 1965 when he was succeeded by Jock Stein.\nEven although he was only 5 ft 6ins, he was renowned for his prowess and ability from headers. His trademark was an almost horizontal, bullet header, which he performed and scored regularly from and which earned him his nicknames, of the \"Human Torpedo\" and the \"Mermaid\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1904", "response": ["** Jimmy McGrory, Scottish footballer (died 1982)"]}, {"page": "1982", "response": ["* October 20 \u2013 Jimmy McGrory, Scottish football player and manager (b. 1904)"]}, {"page": "Celtic F.C.", "response": ["In 1897, the club became a private limited company and Willie Maley was appointed as the first 'secretary-manager'. Between 1905 and 1910, Celtic won the Scottish League Championship six times in a row. They also won the Scottish Cup in both 1907 and 1908, the first times a Scottish club had ever won the double. During World War I, Celtic won the league four times in a row, including 62 matches unbeaten between November 1915 and April 1917. The mid-1920s saw the emergence of Jimmy McGrory as one of the most prolific goalscorers in British football history; over a sixteen-year playing career, he scored 550 goals in 547 games (including 16 goals for Clydebank during a season on loan in 1923\u201324), a British goal-scoring record to this day. In January 1940, Willie Maley's retirement was announced. He was 71 years old and had served the club in varying roles for nearly 52 years, initially as a player and then as secretary-manager. Jimmy McStay became manager of the club in February 1940. He spent over five years in this role, although due to the Second World War no official competitive league football took place during this time. The Scottish Football League and Scottish Cup were suspended and in their place regional league competitions were set up.Rangers dominated wartime football but should their titles be recognised in the record books?, The Scotsman, 21 March 2020 Celtic did not do particularly well during the war years, but did win the Victory in Europe Cup held in May 1945 as a one-off football match to celebrate Victory in Europe Day.", "Ex-player and captain Jimmy McGrory took over as manager in 1945. Under McGrory, Celtic defeated Arsenal, Manchester United and Hibernian to win the Coronation Cup, a one-off tournament held in May 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II. He also led them to a League and Cup double in 1954. On 19 October 1957, Celtic defeated Rangers in the final of the Scottish League Cup at Hampden Park in Glasgow, retaining the trophy they had won for the first time the previous year; the 7\u20131 scoreline remains a record win in a British domestic cup final. The years that followed, however, saw Celtic struggle and the club won no more trophies under McGrory.", "Celtic's board of directors had a reputation of being miserly and authoritarian. In particular they were known for frequently selling their top players and not paying their staff enough; they were also seen as lacking ambition, which caused friction with several managers. Jimmy McGrory's tenure as manager is generally considered a period of underachievement, but with Chairman Robert Kelly's domineering influence. many have questioned how much authority McGrory ever had in team selection. Even Jock Stein's time as manager ended on a sour note when he was offered a place on the Celtic board, but in a role involving ticket sales. Stein felt that this was demeaning, stating he was \"a football man, not a ticket salesman\". He declined this offer and decided to stay in football management, joining Leeds United instead. Billy McNeill won a trophy in each of his five seasons as manager, but was still paid less than the managers of Rangers, Aberdeen and Dundee United. He left the club in June 1983 after his request for a contract and pay rise was publicly rebuffed by the board. McNeill moved on to manage Manchester City, stating that to remain at Celtic would have been humiliating. McNeill's successor, Davie Hay, also had his difficulties with the Celtic board. When trying to sign players in 1987 to strengthen his squad to compete with high-spending Rangers, the board refused to pay for them; chairman Jack McGinn was quoted as saying that if Hay wanted these players, \"he will have to pay for them himself\".", "| Jimmy McGrory || 1945\u20131965", "* Jimmy McGrory", "* Jimmy McGrory", "* Most goals scored in one Scottish top-flight league match by one player: eight goals by Jimmy McGrory against Dunfermline in 9\u20130 win on 14 January 1928.", "* Record scorer: Jimmy McGrory, 522 (1922/23\u00a0\u2013 1937/38)", "* Record scorer in league: Jimmy McGrory, 396", "* Most goals in a season (all competitions): Jimmy McGrory, 62 (1927/28) (47 in League, 15 in Cup competitions)", "* Most goals in a season (league only): Jimmy McGrory, 50 (1935/36)"]}, {"page": "Scottish Premier League", "response": ["Kilmarnock and Rangers player Kris Boyd scored the most goals in the SPL, with 167 goals.
