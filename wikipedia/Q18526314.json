She was a suffragist and active supporter of the Women's Tax Resistance League (WTRL), the members of which protested against the disenfranchisement of women by refusing to pay taxes.\nBorn in Belsize Park, London, Adele was the eldest daughter of the merchant Julius Levis. Her family was Jewish, but nothing else is known of her life until she married the wealthy banker Carl Ferdinand Meyer (1851\u20131922) in 1883. Her husband's association with the merchant banking house of Rothschilds brought the couple into contact with the great and the good of the day, but her new life as a social hostess was insufficient for Adele, who became Lady Meyer when her husband was created a baronet in 1910.\nAdele and her husband were art collectors and enthusiastic patrons of the opera, but in 1910 she described herself as \"a humble social worker\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
