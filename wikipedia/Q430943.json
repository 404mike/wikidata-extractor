He encouraged the rediscovery of English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly Henry Purcell's music and English virginal music. He also propounded the notion of an English Musical Renaissance in the second half of the 19th century, particularly praising Charles Villiers Stanford and Hubert Parry.\nFuller Maitland was criticised for his failure to acknowledge the talents of the English composers Arthur Sullivan, Edward Elgar and Frederick Delius, and later it was shown that he had falsified the facts in a critique of Sullivan. He was also slow to recognise the worth of contemporary composers from mainland Europe such as Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conducting", "response": ["Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. It has been defined as \"the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture.\"Sir George Grove, John Alexander Fuller Maitland, eds. (1922). A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Volume 1, p. 581. Macmillan. The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score in a way which reflects the specific indications in that score, set the tempo, ensure correct entries by ensemble members, and \"shape\" the phrasing where appropriate. Conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, usually with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals such as eye contact. A conductor usually supplements their direction with verbal instructions to their musicians in rehearsal."]}, {"page": "Maitland", "response": ["*John Alexander Fuller Maitland (1856\u20131936), British music critic and scholar"]}, {"page": "Comma (music)", "response": ["In music theory, a comma is a very small interval, the difference resulting from tuning one note two different ways.Waldo Selden Pratt (1922). Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vol. 1, p. 568. John Alexander Fuller Maitland, Sir George Grove, eds. Macmillan. Strictly speaking, there are only two kinds of comma, the syntonic comma, \"the difference between a just major 3rd and four just perfect 5ths less two octaves\", and the Pythagorean comma, \"the difference between twelve 5ths and seven octaves\".Clive Greated (2001). \"Comma\", Grove Music Online.  The word comma used without qualification refers to the syntonic comma,Benson, Dave (2006). Music: A Mathematical Offering, p.\u00a0171. . which can be defined, for instance, as the difference between an F tuned using the D-based Pythagorean tuning system, and another F tuned using the D-based quarter-comma meantone tuning system. Intervals separated by the ratio 81:80 are considered the same note because the 12-note Western chromatic scale does not distinguish Pythagorean intervals from 5-limit intervals in its notation. Other intervals are considered commas because of the enharmonic equivalences of a tuning system. For example, in 53TET, B and A are both approximated by the same interval although they are a septimal kleisma apart."]}, {"page": "Schicksalslied", "response": ["Schicksalslied, which John Lawrence Erb posits is \"perhaps the most widely loved of all of Brahms's compositions and the most perfect of his smaller choral works\", is sometimes referred to as the \"Little Requiem\", as it shares many stylistic and compositional similarities with Brahms's most ambitious choral composition. The Romantic characteristics of Schicksalslied, however, give this piece a closer tie with the \"Alto Rhapsody\" than the Requiem. Whichever piece it most closely relates to, it is clear that Schicksalsied was the work of a master composer working at the height of his skill. John Alexander Fuller Maitland stated that in Schicksalslied, Brahms \"set the pattern of the short choral-ballad, to which, in N\u00e4nie, Op.\u00a082, and the Gesang der Parzen, Op.\u00a089, Brahms subsequently returned\". Likewise, Hadow praises the piece for \"its technical beauties, its rounded symmetry of balance and charm of melody, and its marvelous cadences where chord melts into chord like colour into colour\"."]}]}}
