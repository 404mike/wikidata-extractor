On 28 January 2010, Durham hosted a seminar sponsored by the government of Iran, which attracted protests and coverage in the national press. In February 2011, the Durham Student newspaper Palatinate broke the story that a WikiLeaks cable revealed that a series of Iranian seminars at Durham had been funded by the US State Department as \"political cover\" for contacts with Iran. Vice-Chancellor Chris Higgins claimed in an interview with Palatinate that the funding had not been deliberately hidden and would have been revealed if anyone had asked, but accepted that more should have been done to let participants know the source of the funding. In March 2011, Conservative MP Robert Halfon accused Durham of accepting \"blood money\" from the Iranian government and launched an Early Day Motion (which attracted no other signatories) calling for a Government enquiry. Later that month it was revealed that the university had accepted a \u00a32.5M donation from the prime minister of Kuwait, Sheikh Nasser Al-Sabah, to endow the Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad Al-Sabah Chair and a related research programme in global security, leading to further criticism."]}, {"page": "Durham University", "response": ["The Chancellor of the university is Sir Thomas Allen, who succeeded Bill Bryson in January 2012.

Following a campaign by Robert P. Cook who was a lecturer in Physiological Chemistry, the Department of Biochemistry was formed in 1965.... In 1970, the University of Dundee appointed Peter Garland CBE as its first Chair of Biochemistry based within the Department.http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biochemistry/50th_anniversary/biochemistry/50th_anniversary/docs/50thmagazine.pdf page 2. Peter's arrival coincided with the opening of the Medical Sciences Institute (MSI) and Biological Sciences Institute (BSI) that provided up to date facilities for research to take place. The Department of Biochemistry moved from a converted stable block into the MSI alongside the Department of Anatomy and Physiology. In 1971, Peter recruited Sir Philip Cohen to Dundee, where he has remained ever since and who has played an instrumental role in the expansion of life sciences research in Dundee. The growth of the department was supported by Principal Adam Neville who redirected funds from other areas of the university. Peter had the ethos of employing the best is required to achieve the best, a strategy that exists to this day. Alongside his appointment of Philip, Peter also recruited David Lilley, Grahame Hardie and Chris Higgins. Further key appointments continued, this time led by Graham Warren; Peter's successor. In 1989, the Cancer Research Campaign supported the establishment of laboratories for David Glover, Birgitt Lane and David Lane. In 1990, the Medical Research Council set up the Protein Phosphorylation Unit which still exists today as the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC PPU).", "*Chris Higgins (1981 - 1989)"]}, {"page": "Christopher Higgins (academic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Higgins (academic)"]}, {"page": "List of Private Passions episodes (2005\u20132009)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"9\"|Chris Higgins"]}, {"page": "Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine", "response": ["* Prof Chris Higgins, (Previous Vice Chancellor, Durham University)"]}]}}
