He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and initially pursued a military career. Munro Ferguson was elected to the House of Commons in 1884, defeated a year later, and re-elected in 1886. A Liberal Imperialist, he was an ally of Lord Rosebery and served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury in his government. Munro Ferguson was overlooked for ministerial office by Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith, but in 1914 was appointed Governor-General of Australia. He was politically influential, forming a close bond with Prime Minister Billy Hughes, and was committed to his role as nominal commander-in-chief during World War I. His six years in office was a record until being surpassed by another wartime governor-general, Lord Gowrie. Munro Ferguson was raised to the viscountcy once his term ended, and from 1922 to 1924 returned to politics as Secretary of State for Scotland under Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin. In retirement he held various company directorships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1934", "response": ["** Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar, Scottish politician, 8th Governor-General of Australia (b. 1860)"]}, {"page": "Royal Military College, Sandhurst", "response": ["*Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar (1879\u20131880), Governor-General of Australia "]}, {"page": "Sir Ronald Munro-Ferguson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar"]}, {"page": "Ronald Munro-Ferguson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar"]}]}}
