He is known mainly as a pioneer in the field of motion pictures, having devised a series of cameras in 1888\u20131891 and shot moving pictures with them in London. He went on to patent an early two-colour filming process in 1905. Wealth came with his inventions in printing, including photo-typesetting and a method of printing without ink, and from a chain of photographic studios. However, he spent it all on inventing, went bankrupt three times, was jailed once and died in poverty.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re", "response": ["William Friese-Greene patented a \"machine camera\" in 1889, which embodied many aspects of later film cameras.

Seeking to develop a movie projector system, they hired former Edison employee Eugene Lauste, probably at Dickson's suggestion. In April 1895, Dickson left Edison's employ and provided some assistance to the Latham outfit. Alongside Lauste, he may have devised what would become known as the Latham loop, allowing the photography and exhibition of much longer filmstrips than had previously been possible. This idea had first been made public in 1890 in descriptions of the moving picture camera of William Friese-Greene. These former Edison associates helped to design the Eidoloscope projector system and a widescreen camera to film with, which would be used in the first commercial movie screening in world history on 20 May 1895. But Dickson soon parted company with them, to become part of the group that formed the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, returning permanently to work in the United Kingdom in 1897 for the British side of the company.
