Bill Athey left the club at this time, and while Boycott in his biography maintained that he had no reason to believe that his actions had caused Athey's departure, Athey later stated to biographer Leo McKinstry that \"Boycott's attitude and the atmosphere he created had everything to do with my decision to leave Yorkshire.\" The \"Members 84 Group\", consisting of strong supporters of Boycott, met regularly to clamour for the batsman's reinstatement.McKinstry, pp. 240\u2013241.

On 8 May 2008, however, the ECB revealed that Boycott would not hold such a position. The two had been involved in the past, and while Flintoff is an admirer of Boycott, the ECB stressed any coaching relationship would only be informal. Boycott, however, used to give informal talks to younger cricket players during his career, and the media speculated that he might find a place coaching the England U19s. Boycott continued in his commentating career for TMS, criticising the England team's approach to the ODI matches under Pietersen in India in November 2008.

He was assigned to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and underwent his initial training in Truro, where he and other recruits were housed in a hotel commandeered by the army. Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure. \"Until I travelled to Cornwall, the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to Brighton by train\", he recalled. \"It was the first time I had ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel.\" \"That set the tone for Alf's war\", Leo McKinstry suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties. The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him \"a fitter young fellow than when I reported for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham.\"", "It is alleged that some of the FA's officials had long held grudges against Ramsey. The British journalist and author Leo McKinstry said \"England's most successful manager would have had a legacy fit for a hero had it not been for the malevolence of the FA chief Harold Thompson\".
