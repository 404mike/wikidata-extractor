His decision to put off the election was seen by many at the time as a sign of his domination of the political scene and he ridiculed his opponents by singing old-time music hall star Vesta Victoria's song \"Waiting at the Church\" at that month's Trades Union Congress meeting. This was celebrated at the time but has since been interpreted as one of the greatest moments of hubris in modern British politics. Callaghan intended to convey the message that he had not promised an election, but most observers misread his message as an assertion that he would call an election, and the Conservatives would not be ready for it."]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Vesta Victoria (1873\u20131951)"]}, {"page": "Golders Green Crematorium", "response": ["* Vesta Victoria, music hall performer"]}, {"page": "1903 in music", "response": ["* \"The Country Girl\" (w.
