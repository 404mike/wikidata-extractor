The chorus was co-written by British singer-songwriters MNEK and KABBA. They gave the chorus to KSI, who wrote and recorded two verses for \"Really Love\". Being a UK garage track, KSI \"thought it made sense\" to ask British singer-songwriter Craig David to perform the chorus. KSI recalled, \"We [sent the track] to Craig, hoping [that] he'd say yes. And he gave a resounding yes.\" David recalled, \"[KSI] reached out to me [and said], 'I've got this song that I think you'd be perfect on.' And I was like, 'Yeah, I'd be well up for it. Let me hear the song.' I heard it and I was like, 'Bro, this is a tune.' So I jumped on it that [same] night [and] vocalled it. I was going back and forth with [KSI], asking him, 'What [do you] think?' And he was so on it.\"", "* KABBAsongwriting"]}, {"page": "All Over the Place (KSI album)", "response": ["* KABBAsongwriting "]}]}}
