These voices included: Ernest Becker, Erving Goffman, R.D. Laing; Laing and Aaron Esterson, Thomas Scheff, and Thomas Szasz. Their writings, along with others such as articles in the journal The Radical Therapist, were given the umbrella label \"antipsychiatry\" despite wide divergences in philosophy. This critical literature, in concert with an activist movement, emphasized the hegemony of medical model psychiatry, its spurious sources of authority, its mystification of human problems, and the more oppressive practices of the mental health system, such as involuntary hospitalisation, drugging, and electroshock.Ken Barney, Limitations of the Critique of the Medical Model, The Journal of Mind and Behaviour, Winter and Spring 1994.

Laing, Aaron Esterson, and anthropologist Jules Henry, largely during the 1950s and 1960s.
