A former Southern UK Champion, Steele was involved in a series of strap matches with rival Guy Thunder during the late 1990s and has occasionally teamed with Jake \"the Snake\" Roberts. A trained submission wrestler and martial artist, Steele also appeared at the Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE PPV supercards \"Fighting Athlete\" in March 2001 and True Century Creation II in March 2002.\nWhile competing in the United States with the National Wrestling Alliance, Steele defeated Naoya Ogawa in a three-way match with Brian Anthony in Charlotte, North Carolina on 25 September 1999 to become the first-ever English World Heavyweight Champion in professional wrestling history and one of the youngest wrestlers to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship although he would lose the title to Ogawa one week later in Thomaston, Connecticut on 2 October.\nHe was managed by \"Business Advisor to the Stars\" Mike White (now working as a Sports Journalist for BBC Radio Humberside) at one stage.\nReturning to Great Britain, he became the first NWA United Kingdom Heavyweight Champion after defeating Johnny Moss in a tournament final at Telford Shropshire, England on 2 November 2001.\nAlmost two years after Ogawa had vacated the title, Steele lost to then NWA World Champion Shinya Hashimoto in a round robin triangle match with Steve Corino at McKeesport, Pennsylvania on 15 December 2001.He appeared as a contestant on the UK version of Deal Or No Deal on 28 June 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Wrestling Alliance", "response": ["On September 23, 2017, Nick Aldis made his debut for Championship Wrestling from Hollywood and challenged Tim Storm for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

The champions nonetheless remained wrestlers from independents, regardless of whether they were from North America (Severn, Mike Rapada, Sabu), Asia (Ogawa, Shinya Hashimoto), or Europe (Gary Steele). The situation continued until early 2002, when Severn was able to regain the title from Hashimoto in Japan, albeit with controversy."]}, {"page": "Tom Howard (wrestler)", "response": ["On March 2, 2003 Zero-One True Century Creation II, Tom Howard & Samoa Joe defeated Gary Steele & Steve Corino.

Hashimoto challenged Steve Corino for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in October 2001. The match ended in controversy, leading to the belt being vacated. In December 2001, Hashimoto faced off against Corino and Gary Steele in a Triple Threat Match, winning the vacated NWA World Heavyweight Title. Hashimoto's NWA World Title reign would come to an end in March 2002 through duplicitous means, as a crooked referee gave a fast count, allowing Dan Severn to win the title. Hashimoto then went back to concentrating on Zero-One, where he was an active competitor. In October 2002, Hashimoto teamed with his old rival, Naoya Ogawa, to win the NWA Intercontinental Tag-Team Title (which were usually defended in Zero-One) from John Heidenreich and Nathan Jones. The two defended the championship for the next few months, before falling to Matt Ghaffari and Tom Howard in December 2002. The two teams feuded on and off over the next few months, even as Hashimoto looked to another organization for a major accomplishment."]}, {"page": "Naoya Ogawa", "response": ["In May, Ogawa traveled to United States and defeated Gary Steele to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hashimoto followed him to the country and attacked him (kayfabe this time) in a press conference, challenging him to a title match in Japan with Tatsumi Fujinami as special referee. Naoya toured through United States, retaining the title before Dan Severn, Doug Gilbert and Biggie Biggs, trading it with Steele in a three-way match that also involved Brian Anthony on September 25, 1999, and finally coming back to Japan to meet Hashimoto.
