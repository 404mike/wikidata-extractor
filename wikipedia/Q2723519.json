Because of this, there is still much historical debate over whether certain women in history can be referred to as courtesans. For example, the title was applied to the Byzantine empress Theodora, who had started life as an erotic actress but later became the wife of the Emperor Justinian and, after her death, an Orthodox saint. The term has also been applied to influential women including Anne Boleyn, Umrao Jaan, Madaline Bishop, Diane de Poitiers, Mathilde Kschessinska, Pamela Harriman, Eva Per\u00f3n and Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel. The attempt to define such women as courtesans is often intended to draw attention to certain perceived qualities, ambitions or conduct which are held to be courtesan-like."]}, {"page": "Loudoun County, Virginia", "response": ["* Pamela Harriman (1920\u20131997) \u2013 Daughter-in-law of Sir Winston Churchill and U.S. Ambassador to France"]}, {"page": "Ambassadors of the United States", "response": ["|Pamela Harriman"]}, {"page": "Gianni Agnelli", "response": ["Prior to his marriage on 19 November 1953 to Donna Marella Caracciolo dei principi di Castagneto \u2013 a half-American, half-Neapolitan noblewoman who made a small but significant name as a fabric designer, and a bigger name as a   tastemakerAlmanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1942), 398\u2013399. \u2013 Agnelli was a noted playboy whose mistresses included the socialite Pamela Harriman and even Jackie Kennedy.
