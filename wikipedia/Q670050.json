Farrer's interest in sending back attractive new plants with horticultural potential, however, was sometimes at odds with Balfour's desire for a comprehensive inventory of all the plants of the region. Farrer's collecting trips are particularly interesting when viewed in the context of the global plant exchanges which occurred during British Imperial rule. During this time crops and other plants were transplanted from then-native habitats to others throughout the Empire for a variety of economic, medical and scientific reasons. At a domestic level, too, while Farrer and other plant collectors introduced new species to British gardens, sentimental colonists took with them plants, and animals, which reminded them of home.\""]}, {"page": "Chapmannia gracilis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Crotalaria socotrana", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Crotalaria strigulosa", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Dichrostachys dehiscens", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Indigofera marmorata", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Lotus mollis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Lotus ononopsis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Taverniera sericophylla", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Tephrosia odorata", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}, {"page": "Trigonella falcata", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour"]}]}}
