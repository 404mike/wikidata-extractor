The design of the Lions remedied some of the shortcomings of the preceding battlecruisers, which suffered from an inability of the en echelon amidships turrets to safely fire across the deck, limiting them to a three-turret broadside. This was done because the greater size and weight of the new guns rendered wing turrets impracticable. As such, all four turrets in the Lions were arranged on the centreline; 'Q' turret was located amidships and could only fire on the broadside.Burt, p. 176 The Director of Naval Construction, Sir Philip Watts, suggested that a fifth turret, superfiring over the rear turret, could be added if the ship was lengthened by three frames,  in total, and that this would add very little cost other than the \u00a3175,000 for the additional turret but add 25% more firepower to the ship.Roberts, p. 33 This was not approved, possibly because of doubts about its feasibility."]}, {"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Sir Philip Watts \u2013 naval architect, designer of the Elswick cruiser and HMS Dreadnought"]}, {"page": "HMS Princess Royal (1911)", "response": ["The Lion-class battlecruisers, nicknamed the \"Splendid Cats\", were designed by Philip Watts, the Director of Naval Construction, to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the Moltke class as the German ships were to the Indefatigable class.

On 19 November 1908, Rear-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, the Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, proposed the changes that he would like to make to the Neptunes design.

Likely prompted by an earlier memo from Admiral Francis Bridgeman, commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet, Jellicoe wanted to eliminate the mainmast and transfer most of the functions of its spotting top to an armoured spotting tower atop the conning tower in the superstructure. The Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO), Rear-Admiral Reginald Bacon, argued that the spotting top in the foremast should be retained. Jellicoe was willing to slightly increase the new design's displacement over Neptune, but it could not cost any more, which placed major constraints on the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Philip Watts.Brooks 1995, pp. 42\u201344; Friedman 2015, pp. 111\u201312, 114"]}, {"page": "Indefatigable-class battlecruiser", "response": ["At the time the final design of Indefatigable was approved, the Admiralty was already moving on, Fisher writing in September 1908 \"I've got Sir Philip Watts into a new Indomitable that will make your mouth water when you see it\", a design that was to eventually emerge as .
