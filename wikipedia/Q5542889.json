In 1803, Carl Ludwig Willdenow invalidly changed the name to Aster fruticulosus. In 1828, Henri Cassini described another specimen as Diplostephium longipes. When Christian Friedrich Lessing reassigned Linaeus's species, he maintained Willdenow's change, calling the species Diplopappus fruticulosus. Nees von Esenbeck also kept the invalid name, when he moved it again, creating the combination Diplostephium fruticulosum in 1833. In the same publication he also described Diplostephium extenuatum, which was reassigned by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who made the name Diplopappus extenuatus in 1836. George Nicholson proposed to include the species in the genus Felicia and so made the combination that is currently in use: Felicia fruticosa. Margaret Levyns published a correction of Lessing's error in 1948, making the combination Diplopappus fruticosus. In 1973 J\u00fcrke Grau considered all these names synonymous."]}, {"page": "American Agriculturist", "response": ["In 1889, it published The Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening: A Practical and Scientific Encyclopedia of Horticulture for Gardeners and Botanists, (in 4 Volumes), which was edited by George Nicholson,  This became the basis of the RHS's Dictionary of Gardening."]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (K\u2013P)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Nicholson\"|George Nicholson (1847\u20131908)"]}]}}
