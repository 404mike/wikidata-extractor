Some theorized that the media's continued interest regarding her weight and the pressure of success at 19 years of age, in addition to her on-court breakdown and her parents' divorce, as well as her coach's walking out in the middle of the match, led to this breakdown.

However, from 2009 to 2012, her service game has largely been viewed as a liability instead of a weapon. This is because of her inconsistent ball tosses which are directly associated with her diminishing confidence. Nonetheless, in 2013, under the tutelage of Nigel Sears, her ball tosses become more consistent, allowing her to build her game on her powerful first serves."]}, {"page": "Claire Curran", "response": ["Curran retired from professional sport in 2007 following six years of professional play.

Her next tournament was the Stuttgart Grand Prix where she was the 2019 finalist. In her first-round match, she defeated a qualifier, German teenager Julia Middendorf, to set up a match against the world No. 4 and third seed Sofia Kenin. She upset the American to reach the quarterfinals, a feat she had achieved in her four previous main-draw appearances at the tournament. In the quarterfinals, she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in three sets. Shortly after the tournament Kontaveit and Nigel Sears announced an amicable coaching split after three years together.", "Kontaveit is an aggressive baseline player, who utilizes a variety of strokes to force opponents to hit awkward returns; this enables her to strike fast winners or draw quick errors. Due to her aggressive playing style, Kontaveit typically accumulates large numbers of both winners and unforced errors. Both her forehand and her two-handed backhand are hit flat, with relentless depth, power, and penetration, allowing her to dictate play from the first stroke of the rally. Despite this, Kontaveit is adept at hitting her backhand with slice, slowing down the pace of rallies; she typically utilises this shot while playing defensively, allowing her to slow down the pace of a rally, and reposition herself, so that she can resume her aggressive playing style. Kontaveit possesses a powerful first serve, which peaks at 109\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h), allowing her to serve aces. Kontaveit also possesses effective kick and slice second serves, which prevents her from serving double faults, and also prohibits opponents from scoring free points from second serve returns. Although she typically plays from the baseline, Kontaveit is adept at the net due to her doubles experience, and frequently attacks the net with powerful swinging volleys, which she utilises to finish points quickly. She typically aims to receive short balls from her opponents; as such, she will typically attack with a high kick serve, alter pace with a backhand slice, and change direction in a prolonged rally to do so. She is also noted for her speed around the baseline, allowing her to reach most shots and counterpunch effectively, and to hit running forehands; this is aided by her exceptional footwork, stamina, and court coverage. Since hiring Nigel Sears as her coach she improved her service action adding more power and variety to it, such as utilising the kick serve which has helped save break points against opponents; her serve made further improvements under the tutelage of Dmitry Tursunov, developing into a reliable server, who serves multiple aces in any given match. Kontaveit's movement also improved whilst working with Tursunov, allowing her to hit powerful groundstroke winners on the run, and also developed a more confident, positive mindset. She has also become more aggressive and learned when to pull the trigger in rallies, allowing her to develop into a proactive player, who dominates her opponents through sheer power and aggression."]}, {"page": "BT Sport", "response": ["From January 2017, BT Sport had the rights to show 52 WTA tournaments every year until 2019.
