Headon was quickly fired for his heroin addiction and Lennard either left or was fired and the band folded.

Casey also discussed how the rollout of new songs had possibly changed, saying \"We started the process with releasing a two song single last month, and there was supposed to be another one in May, and another sometime in the summer, so we'd be teasing part of the album leading up to September -- but who knows if those are gonna happen now at this point, the way things are going. We said, 'While we work all that out, let's just play the goddamn songs.'\" Casey also said the band financially would take a hit due to their shows being postponed. \"[We have] zero insurance. We don't even carry cancelation insurance on our shows. We've been through this a few times before with festivals that were canceled because of hurricanes or storms. The cost of a band of our size, we'd be paying a third of our guarantee for every show for insurance.
