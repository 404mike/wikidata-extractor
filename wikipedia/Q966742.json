Designed by Bartels, the Liver birds were constructed by the Bromsgrove Guild.\nDuring the First World War, Bartels was imprisoned in an internment camp on the Isle of Man, even though he had been a naturalised Briton for more than 20 years. After the war Bartels was forcibly repatriated to Germany, leaving behind his wife in England.\nBartels returned to the United Kingdom and lived and worked in Harringay until his death in 1955, producing carvings for Durham Cathedral, various stately homes and even making artificial limbs during the Second World War.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Liver Building", "response": ["Atop each tower stand the mythical Liver Birds, designed by Carl Bernard Bartels. The birds are named Bella and Bertie, looking to the sea and inland, respectively.Bella may possibly be named for Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, the queen consort of King John, when Liverpool was granted its royal charter. Bertie may possibly be named for Edward VII, who was known as Bertie to the royal family and who was one of the reigning monarchs, at the time of the building's construction. Popular legend has it that while one giant bird looks out over the city to protect its people, the other bird looks out to sea at the new sailors coming in to port. Alternatively, local legend states one Liver Bird is male, looking inland to see if the pubs are open, whilst the other is female, looking out to sea to see if there are any handsome sailors coming up the river."]}, {"page": "Liver bird", "response": ["Representations of the bird can be found throughout Liverpool, most numerously on the heritage lamp standards in the town centre on which small versions sit as a top piece.
