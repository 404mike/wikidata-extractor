He also appeared for the Football League XI in 1906\u201307 against the Irish League and Scottish League representative sides, and played in two England trials. He made more than 300 appearances for Small Heath in all competitions. After retiring from playing he ran a pub in his native Coventry, and died in that city aged 51.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Dorrington", "response": ["A native of Smethwick, which was then an urban district in Staffordshire, Dorrington took over in goal from Nat Robinson in 1907\u201308, but remained undisputed first choice for only a couple of seasons. Injury forced his retirement in or around 1913."]}, {"page": "Ike Webb", "response": ["Webb was born in Worcester. He played for a number of non-league clubs before joining Small Heath in 1898. He made his debut in the Second Division on 2 April 1898, deputising for Henry Clutterbuck in a 2\u20131 away win against Luton Town. Described as \"a big, burly goalkeeper with outstanding reflexes,\u00a0... quick off his line\", Webb played three more games at the end of the 1897\u201398 season, and one the following season.Matthews, pp. 144\u201345.

Bob McRoberts was the top scorer with 24 goals, of which 19 came in league matches. No other player reached double figures. McRoberts, goalkeeper Nat Robinson and full-back Arthur Archer played in every match. Off the field, the club made a significant financial loss over the season. The directors made it clear they could not continue funding a loss-making enterprise, and suggested that a reduction in players' wages was the only course of action.", "At home to another new team, Chesterfield Town, Walter Wigmore dropped back to centre-half in place of Alex Leake, who had been injured in the Charity Cup-tie. Billy Bennett replaced Wigmore in the forward line. Playing against a strong wind, McRoberts opened the scoring when he was first to the rebound after his shot was fumbled, and Bennett converted a cross from Sid Wharton not long before the interval. Persistent attacking led to further goals, from Harry Wilcox and Walter Main, before the visitors' Herbert Munday scored when the ball rebounded off the crossbar. Main scored his second, and the home team's fifth, from a sweeping passing move, then Chesterfield made the final score 5\u20133.\"Small Heath v. Chesterfield\". The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent: p.8. 18 September 1899. On a pitch made slippery by a thunderstorm before kickoff, the visitors had Nat Robinson to thank for keeping Gainsborough Trinity at bay; the home side protested that one shot \"scooped out\" by Robinson had in fact crossed the line. Then McRoberts scored a solo goal, Trinity's goalkeeper allowed Wharton's shot from distance to slip through his hands into the net, and Wharton made the half-time score 3\u20130 after a move between McRoberts and Wigmore left him a tap-in. Freddie Fenton pulled one back with a header after Robinson missed his punch, and Bennett made the final score 4\u20131 after the goalkeeper failed to hold a low shot.\"Gainsbro' Trinity v. Small Heath\". The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent: p.8. 25 September 1899. It was confirmed that Leake had gone to Manchester for specialist treatment on damaged ankle ligaments. At home to Bolton Wanderers, relegated from the First Division in 1899, the defence was worked hard from the outset, but Small Heath \"began to wake up\", and the attack went to the other end, John Willie Sutcliffe playing \"grandly\", particularly when the visitors temporarily went down to ten men. In heavy rain in the second half, the defences had the upper hand, and the game finished goalless.\"Small Heath v. Bolton Wanderers\". The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent: p.8. 2 October 1899. With four wins and a draw, Small Heath went into October in third place in the league, two points behind Leicester Fosse having played one game fewer.", "Twenty-one different players represented the club in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and there were fifteen different goalscorers.
