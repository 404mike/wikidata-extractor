Unlike the original song, Bertie's pretensions to gentility are belied by his residence in Bow, in the poverty-stricken East End of London, though his status as an idler ironically links him to the leisured aristocratic class, who reside in the West End.Pegler, Martin, Soldiers' Songs and Slang of the Great War Osprey Publishing, 2014, , page 256."]}, {"page": "Ella Shields", "response": ["Ella Shields (September 27, 1879 \u2013 August 5, 1952)Ella Shields biography at BFI accessed 20 Jun 2007 was a music hall singer and male-impersonator.

It was a parody of an earlier song, simply called Burlington Bertie, written by Harry B. Norris and made famous by Vesta Tilley.The Times(London, England), 6 August 1952, p. 6 Obituary: Miss Ella Shields. The song was allegedly intended by Hargreaves for a comic singer, J. W. Rickaby, who turned it down as too closely modelled on another. Shields sang the song, dressed up in slightly battered top hat and tails, in the role of Burlington Bertie 'himself'. She toured the world in this role, including appearances at Baltimore's now-demolished Maryland Theatre in 1924 and '26. The persona of Bertie haunted the rest of her life and she was known as Bertie as much as Ella. She and Hargreaves had separated in 1916 and they divorced in 1923.The Times (London, England), 8 May 1923, p. 5: High Court Of Justice. Under the name Mrs Ella Hargreaves, Shields petitioned for divorce from William Joseph Hargreaves, claiming her husband had treated her with aggravated cruelty before deserting her in 1916. She admitted that subsequently, between August 1917 and 1918, she had entered an adulterous relationship with a Colonel Christie, which had now ended.
