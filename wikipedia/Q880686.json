Contrary to the claims of some of his later advocates, however, he was not the first president to serve under the Articles nor the first to be elected under the Articles. When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, Congress did not bother to elect a new president; instead, Samuel Huntington continued serving a term that had already exceeded a year. On July 9, 1781, Samuel Johnston became the first man to be elected as president of Congress after the ratification of the Articles. He declined the office, however, perhaps to make himself available for North Carolina's gubernatorial election. After Johnston turned down the office, Thomas McKean was elected. McKean served just a few months, resigning in October 1781 after hearing news of the British surrender at Yorktown. Congress asked him to remain in office until November, when a new session of Congress was scheduled to begin. It was in that session that Hanson began to serve his one-year term. A highlight of Hanson's term was when George Washington presented Cornwallis's sword to Congress."]}, {"page": "March 19", "response": ["*1734 \u2013 Thomas McKean, American lawyer and politician, 2nd Governor of Pennsylvania (d. 1817)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Mifflin", "response": ["On December 21, 1790, Mifflin became the last President of Pennsylvania and the first Governor of the Commonwealth.

The delegation for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted among themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean, who voted yes, and George Read, who voted no. The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.Burnett, Continental Congress, 182; Jensen, Founding, 700.", "The Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official.

Delaware formally broke from Pennsylvania in 1704. New Castle again became the seat of the colonial government, thriving with the various judges and lawyers that fueled the economy.  Many smaller houses were torn down and replaced in this era.  In February 1777, John McKinly was elected the first President of Delaware (a title later renamed \"Governor\"). During the Revolution, when New Castle was besieged by William Howe, the government elected to move its functions south to Dover in May 1777.
