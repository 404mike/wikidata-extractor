It is debatable first how successful the Christian Socialists were in effecting changes of attitude and policy within the Church. Rev Percy Widdrington, looking back in 1945, wrote: \u2019The poverty of the people and the degradation which resulted from it were the motives that impelled us to action. To expect any move from the official Church would have been fantastic. It was as complacent and smug as the rest of society.'Quoted in Maurice Reckitt\u2019s Prospect for Christendom 1945 Secondly it can be argued that because of their failure to engage with the trades unions and the working man, these Christian Socialist groups never received enough credit for their contribution to the intellectual debates of the late Victorian era, especially when the Labour Party broke through in the General Election of 1906.Kilcrease, Bethany https://www.academia.edu/1691186/The_Mass_and_the_Masses_Nineteenth-Century_Anglo-Catholic_Socialism Aquinas College, Michigan"]}, {"page": "Rose Cohen (communist)", "response": ["Her education allowed Cohen to get a job in the London County Council, where she worked until 1917, and later in the Labour Research Department.
