His father was an agricultural labourer. Three of the sons, Robert, Samuel, and Thomas, became ministers in the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Thomas was mainly self-taught, leaving school at the age of twelve to work on a farm. Three years later he was apprenticed to a carpenter at Shipton, a neighbouring village. At every available moment he read and studied, and in July 1801 joined the Methodist society and threw his energies into biblical study and religious work. In September 1804 he was sent by the Wesleyan conference as an itinerant preacher into the Spilsby circuit. For twenty years he laboured in the Wesleyan Methodist Church in the same capacity, occupying some of the most important circuits, such as Preston and Wakefield, Manchester, Lincoln, Leeds, and London. His position and influence grew rapidly. From 1824 to 1842 he was editor of the Wesleyan Methodist magazines, and, despite his lack of a liberal education in youth, he performed his duties with marked success.
