However, due to the outbreak of World War I this agreement which made Abdulaziz the wali or governor of Najd was not materialized and because of the Ottomans' attempt to develop a connection with Abdulaziz the British government soon established diplomatic relations with Abdulaziz. The British agent, Captain William Shakespear, was well received by the Bedouin.Robert Wilson and Zahra Freeth. (1983). The Arab of the Desert. London: Allen & Unwin. pp. 312\u201313. Print. Similar diplomatic missions were established with any Arabian power who might have been able to unify and stabilize the region. The British entered into the Treaty of Darin in December 1915, which made the lands of the House of Saud a British protectorate and attempted to define the boundaries of the developing Saudi state.John C.
