Aged only 23, his majority of 11% was a surprise, since Appleby had returned only Conservatives since 1885.\nHowever, Rigg resigned from the Liberal party in November 1904 because he found himself in agreement with the Conservative government on so many key issues.  The Liberals then selected Leif Jones as their candidate for the imminent by-election, and although campaigning began before Christmas, there was as yet no vacancy.  Rigg claimed that the \"ruffianism\" of Liberals angry at his defection of the party had made him ill, and he went to an unnamed continental health resort to recover. He returned to England in February 1905, and resigned his seat 11 February 1905 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead, telling the annual dinner of the Carlisle Conservative Club \"I am proud to be one of you now ... I have the satisfaction of feeling that what I have done was conscientious and right.\"  At the resulting  by-election on 2 March 1905, Jones held the seat, though with a reduced majority.Rigg subsequently served as a councillor on Westminster City Council, representing Great Marlborough ward from February 1924 to November 1925, and St Margaret ward from February 1930 until his death. He was elected Mayor of Westminster for 1939\u201340. He was a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the local government wing of the Conservatives.\nHe died at Hove, East Sussex in 1942, aged 65.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rigg", "response": ["* Richard Rigg (British politician) (1877\u20131942), British Liberal politician who defected to the Conservatives", "* Richard Rigg (Canadian politician) (1872\u20131964), Canadian minister and politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Richard Rigg "]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Richard Rigg"]}]}}
