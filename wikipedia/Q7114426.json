It is described in the \u2018Archaeological Survey of County Cavan\u2019 (Site No. 18) as- Situated on the summit of a ridge and with commanding views in all directions. A large, round cairn, some 3m high, is much denuded and greatly disturbed by field fences. Richardson, writing c. 1739, (quoted by Paterson, Gaffikin and Davies 1938), recorded the name of the site as 'Carn Dallan' and claimed that a passage was discovered in the cairn 'about twenty-five years ago' and that 'severall urns, 5 large skulls and a great deal of burnt bones' were found in one of three 'apartments' there. This account would suggest that the cairn may have covered a passage tomb. Richardson also noted, just S of the cairn, a square enclosure about twenty yards across bounded by 'large stones set deep in the ground', and 'in the circuit of the hill . . . four small plots of ground of a circular figure inclosed with large stones, all of which are old burial places.' These have not been located. (Paterson, Gaffikin and Davies 1938, 143-5). In 1739 Dean John Richardson (the rector of Annagh Parish, County Cavan  1709-1747) stated- In the Parish of Killdallan there is a carn or heap of stones, 142 yards in circumference, on the top of a high hill about 2 furlongs distant from the church northward. The land on which it stands (belonging to John Stanford of Belturbet Esq.) seems to have lost its ancient name, for it hath from time out of mind been called Carn Dallan, from Dallan, a Dane of great note who lived here. On the north side are the remains of a rampart of a semicircular figure joyning to it, and on the south side the remains of another. What was the use of the ramparts and of the ground contained within them I cannot learn from tradition. The passage into this monument was found out about twenty-five years ago (c. 1714), by a man who had occasion to remove some stones on the north side, came to a broad flag that covered the mouth of it in the quarter there, and three of its apartments, in one of which there are severall urns, 5 large skulls and a great deal of burnt bones. Near the carn to the south there is a piece of ground about 20 yards square enclosed with large stones set deep in the ground, a yard off one smaller, and in the circuit of the hill there are four small plots of ground of a circular figure inclosed with large stones, all of which are old burial places.[Dean Richardson's Further Account of Com. Cavan by Patterson, T.G.F., Gaffikin, M. and Davies, O.,  in 1938 Ulster Journal of Archaeology 1, 142-151.] John O'Donovan writing in the Ordnance Survey Memoirs of 1835 states- There is a large carn of stones 150 links in diameter, with subterraneous chambers or caves beneath. Owen Connellan wrote the following note in his 1846 edition of the Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1470- It is supposed that Conall Cernach was buried on the hill now called Carn Hill, in the adjoining parish of Kildallon, and the great heap of stones or carn there, erected over him as a sepulchre. However Connellan seems to have confused the burial place with the carn in Killarah townland, where local tradition states that the Ulaid hero Conall Cernach is buried there.The Death of Conall Cernach at Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan, by Tom Smith in Breifne Journal 2012"]}, {"page": "List of English translations from medieval sources: A", "response": ["* The annals of Ireland (1846).MacDermott, P., Connellan, O., O'Clery, M.
