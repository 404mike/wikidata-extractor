In the early 1980s she excelled as Miss Hannigan in the musical Annie at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, taking over the role from her friend, actress Sheila Hancock.\nHer television credits included parts on such British programmes as Coronation Street, Crossroads, The Bill, Midsomer Murders and George and Mildred. Her final television appearance, at the age of 81, was in April 2005 when she was cast in an episode of the BBC crime drama Judge John Deed. She also appeared as Richard Beckinsale's mother in the 1973 film version of The Lovers.\nShe was born Stella Ellen Morris at Ladywood, Birmingham, Warwickshire, and was educated locally. Her ambitions to work in the theatre were interrupted by the Second World War, and she joined the ATS.\nWhile stationed at Donnington in Shropshire, Stella appeared in camp concerts as a featured singer in an Ordnance Corps dance band and was spotted by the producer George Black; she toured the Middle and Far East.\nIn March 1949, she made her first appearance in a musical, as Annie Ogle-Eyes in Belinda Fair at the Saville Theatre. She went on to appear in Frank Loesser's The Most Happy Fella at the Coliseum, and in 1962 she moved to the Savoy Theatre to appear in No\u00ebl Coward's breezy Sail Away, where she was also stand-in for the star, Elaine Stritch, in the role of Mimi Paragon.\nIn 1966 her career faltered when a production of Funny Girl, starring Barbra Streisand and in which she appeared as Mrs. Meeker, closed abruptly at the Prince of Wales Theatre, three months into what should have been a lengthy run. She returned to the West End in 1974 to play the brothel-keeper Madame Blanche in Julian More's musical, Bordello, at the Queen's Theatre.\nStella Moray never married. She died, aged 83, from undisclosed causes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Auxiliary Territorial Service", "response": ["* Stella Moray"]}, {"page": "Annie Walker (Coronation Street)", "response": ["In her final years at the Rovers, age was no obstacle to Annie, and she continued to rule with an iron fist. In 1976, when her business was threatened by Renee Bradshaw's (Madge Hindle) application to turn the Corner Shop into an off-licence, Annie petitioned against her, but the matter was settled in court in favour of Renee. At 67, Annie decided to learn to drive, and to pass her test after fewer than 86 lessons - the number her friend and rival Nellie Harvey (Mollie Sugden) had taken. To the surprise of all (after her first lesson ended with her hitting a lamp post), she passed her test first time and bought a second-hand Rover 2000. Not long after getting the car, Annie was stopped by the police while doing a turn in the road, and was breathalysed. Much to her horror, the crystal turned green. A blood test taken at the police station proved Annie was below the limit, but by that time her companion Kitty Stonely (Stella Moray) had already spread the word among Annie's posh friends at the Lady Victuallers."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2006", "response": ["*Stella Moray, 83, British actress and performer."]}, {"page": "The Benny Hill Show", "response": ["* Stella Moray"]}, {"page": "2006 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Stella Moray, actress (born 1923)"]}, {"page": "Alexander the Greatest", "response": ["*Stella Moray \u2013 Fay Green (series 2)"]}, {"page": "1923 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 29 July \u2013 Stella Moray, actress (died 2006)"]}, {"page": "Stars in Battledress", "response": ["* Stella Moray (actress)"]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Kitty Stonely || Stella Moray || 1971\u20131972"]}, {"page": "Sail Away (musical)", "response": ["The show was then staged at the Savoy Theatre in the West End in 1962, where it ran for 252 performances, directed by Coward.
