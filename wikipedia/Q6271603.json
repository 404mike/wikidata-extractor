Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in: \"the politics of innuendo, mounting false challenges and running a campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party's political opponents.\" Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC's The Politics Show on Sunday 18 November 2007, when presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show's production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday. The document excoriated Clegg on a number of policy and political issues and was titled \"Calamity Clegg\". When challenged about the document, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the document title but agreed with the points within it. Asked how it was possible that he had no knowledge of such a major document sent to the producer of the show he was due to appear on, Huhne replied: \"It's quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office... But I can assure you that's not had my authorization.\" After Clegg complained about what he called \"dirty tricks\" and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne's campaign manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an \"over-zealous researcher\" and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release. \"The document title had not been approved before the document was sent out and neither Chris nor I were aware of it.\""]}, {"page": "Jeremy Vine", "response": ["Vine was one of the original presenters of Broadcasting House on BBC Radio 4 and presented The Politics Show on BBC One from its launch in 2003 until Jon Sopel took over in 2005."]}, {"page": "BBC controversies", "response": ["Early in January 2018, it was announced that Carrie Gracie, the BBC's China editor, had resigned from the role because of the salary gender disparity.
