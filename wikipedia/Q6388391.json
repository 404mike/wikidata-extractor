Ken was one of a rare breed of forwards with an ability to dominate games with sheer physical power and incredible ball-handling skills. At 6' 1\" and over sixteen stones Ken was a towering figure, quick runner and a damaging defender who always took the game to the opposition. He was an intimidating scrummager, inspiring pack leader and a player to be feared, respected and admired.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Halifax Panthers", "response": ["* Ken Roberts 1982", ":Great Britain: Ken Roberts 10", ":Lancashire: Ken Roberts 4"]}, {"page": "Swinton Lions", "response": ["* Ken Roberts"]}, {"page": "Berwyn Jones", "response": ["*Photograph \"Ken Roberts pulled down - Ken Roberts is pulled down as Berwyn Jones supports. - 23/03/1968\" at rlhp.co.uk"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain national rugby league team players", "response": ["* Ken Roberts circa-1965", "* Ken Roberts circa-1963"]}]}}
