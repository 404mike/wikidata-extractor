Becoming one of few players to play against the Lions in multiple tours, Kaino took part in the first test of the 2017 series on 24 June 2017 by starting at blindside flanker for his home crowd at Eden Park. Kaino was subbed off in the 45th minute, being replaced by Ardie Savea as the All Blacks went on to win 30-15. Kaino was unfortunately subbed off less than 30 minutes into the second test of the Lions series due to the red-carding of Blues teammate Sonny Bill Williams. Kaino was replaced by debutant Ngani Laumape so that the All Blacks were not a back short at set-piece. Kaino was also yellow-carded in the third test's 49th minute for a swinging forearm on Lions lock Alun Wyn Jones, who had to be replaced by Courtney Lawes as he copped a blow from Kaino's arm. The series was disappointing for Kaino and for the All Blacks who allowed the Lions to break multiple records as the series was drawn 1-1."]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union team records", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Courtney Lawes"]}, {"page": "List of Adidas sponsorships", "response": ["*  Courtney Lawes"]}]}}
