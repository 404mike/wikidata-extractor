As a consequence of this, the Territorial Army was ordered to be doubled in size, with each unit forming a 2nd Line duplicate. The 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division was reconstituted as was the brigade, now the 113th Infantry Brigade. The 113th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Llewellyn Alston, was formed as a duplicate of the 160th Infantry Brigade and initially consisted of two TA battalions, the 15th and 2/5th, of the Welch Regiment and one, the 4th, of the Monmouthshire Regiment. However, the brigade never saw active service outside the United Kingdom during the Second World War and was reduced to a Lower Establishment and eventually became a training brigade."]}]}}
