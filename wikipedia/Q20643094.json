In 1966, however, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner spoke of a revived Expressionism as being \"a new style, successor to my International Modern of the 1930s, a post-modern style\", and included as examples Le Corbusier's work at Ronchamp and Chandigarh, Denys Lasdun at the Royal College of Physicians in London, Richard Sheppard at Churchill College, Cambridge, and James Stirling's and James Gowan's Leicester Engineering Building, as well as Philip Johnson's own guest house at New Canaan, Connecticut. Pevsner disapproved of these buildings for their self-expression and irrationalism, but he acknowledged them as \"the legitimate style of the 1950s and 1960s\" and defined their characteristics. The job of defining Postmodernism was subsequently taken over by a younger generation who welcomed rather than rejected what they saw happening and, in the case of Robert Venturi, contributed to it."]}, {"page": "Architectural Association School of Architecture", "response": ["*James Gowan"]}, {"page": "Gowan", "response": ["*James Gowan (1923\u20132015), Scottish architect"]}, {"page": "1963 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* c.

Architects who continued to employ styles informed by the past included James Robert Rhind and James Miller. From the mid-twentieth century, architecture in Scotland became increasingly utilitarian and influenced by modernism. Key Scottish architects in this movement included Thomas S. Tait, James Stirling and James Gowan. The introduction of brutalism led to urban clearances and extensive use of the tower block. The style was also used in new towns like Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but has received considerable criticism. More recent major architectural projects include the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow, the many striking modern buildings along the side of the River Clyde and the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh.", "In the post-war period Scotland continued to produce important architects, including James Stirling (1926\u201392), who with James Gowan (1923\u2013) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955\u201358), considered a landmark in the development of modernist, brutalist residential planning, which would have a profound impact in Scotland.H. F. Mallgrave, Modern Architectural Theory: A Historical Survey, 1673\u20131968 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 353.

Baker, The Architecture of James Stirling and His Partners James Gowan and Michael Wilford: A Study of Architectural Creativity in the Twentieth Century (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011), . The post-war desire for urban regeneration would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. Robert Matthew (1906\u201375) and Basil Spence (1907\u201376) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow, for demolitions at the University of Edinburgh and the stark rebuilding typified by the David Hume Tower (1960\u201363, now named 40 George Square). Another solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like Glenrothes (1948) and Cumbernauld (1956), designed to take excess population from the cities. Cumbernauld was praised for its architecture when first built, but the uncompleted centre and the layout of the town in general, were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century: its modernist architecture described by one resident as \"the lego fantasy of an unhappy child\".A.

Due to pressure of work, delivery of the scheme was given to outside architects (first Roman Halter and then James Gowan) who made a number of changes (including red brick facing instead of concrete) without affecting the fundamentals of the design.
