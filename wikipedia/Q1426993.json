Pearson's mentor and polymath, Francis Galton, who founded the erstwhile Galton Laboratory of UCL, is considered to be the father of psychometrics and differential psychology. Several important contributions to areas such as statistics and evolutionary game theory were made by figures like Kirstine Smith, Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and John Maynard Smith associated with the lab. In the field of experimental psychology, several faculty members of UCL's Faculty of Brain Sciences like James Sully, Charles Spearman and Tim Shallice made noted contributions to advance the field. The Bartlett, was the first architecture and built environment school established in the UK in 1841 and since, many of its faculty members like Patrick Abercrombie and Peter Hall have made notable contributions to the field of planning.
