In his 1890 book The Colours of Animals, he classified different types such as \"special protective resemblance\" (where an animal looks like another object), or \"general aggressive resemblance\" (where a predator blends in with the background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallow-tailed moth pupae were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as larvae. Poulton's \"general protective resemblance\" was at that time considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when Frank Evers Beddard wrote in 1892 that \"tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of parrots, iguanas, tree-frogs, and the green tree-snake are examples\". Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the \"alluring coloration\" of the flower mantis and the possibility of a different mechanism in the orange tip butterfly. He wrote that \"the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant [an umbellifer], so close is their mutual resemblance.\" He also explained the coloration of sea fish such as the mackerel: \"Among pelagic fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below.\""]}, {"page": "Dudley", "response": ["* Frank Evers Beddard FRS FRSE (1858 in Dudley \u2013 1925) English zoologist,  Chrono-Biographical Sketches, Beddard, Frank Evers (England 1858\u20131925) retrieved December 2017 he became a leading authority on annelids, including earthworms and oligochaetes."]}, {"page": "William Henry Hudson", "response": ["*British Birds (1895), with a chapter by Frank Evers Beddard"]}, {"page": "Dwarf sperm whale", "response": ["The first two dwarf sperm whale specimens, a male and a female, were collected in 1853 by naturalist Sir Walter Elliot, who thought it a kind of porpoise due to the short snout. However, when he sent drawings of these whales\u2013including skeletal diagrams\u2013to biologist Richard Owen to describe, Owen, in his 1866 paper, recognized it as a type of sperm whale in the family Physeteridae based on several similar characteristics, such as having functional teeth in only the lower jaw, a lopsided blowhole leaning towards the left side, and a spermaceti organ. He named it Physeter (Euphysetes) simus, the same genus as the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and the pygmy sperm whale (now Kogia breviceps), with Euphysetes acting as a subgenus. The species name simus is Latin for \"stump-nosed\", a reference to its blunt snout. John Edward Gray, when he created the genus Kogia in 1846, gave no indication to the meaning, but, since the word has a feminine ending, the masculine species name simus had to be changed to sima to fit this when the combination Kogia simus was proposed by various 20th century authors. In 1900, zoologist Frank Evers Beddard speculated that the word \"might be a tribute to a Turk of the past surnamed Cogia Effendi, who observed whales in the Mediterranean\"."]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1916: Frank Evers Beddard"]}, {"page": "Prosector", "response": ["* Frank Evers Beddard "]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Frank Evers Beddard (1858\u20131925), English zoologist who won the 1916 Linnean Medal"]}, {"page": "Countershading", "response": ["A completely different function of animal (and military vehicle) coloration is to camouflage the top and bottom surfaces differently, to match their backgrounds below and above respectively.

Many have powerful forelimbs and claws adapted to excavating the nests of ant or termite colonies from the earth or from wood or under bark. Most have reduced teeth and some have reduced jaws as well. Practically all have long, sticky tongues. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century many zoologists saw these shared features as evidence of relatedness, and accordingly they regarded the various species as single order of Mammalia, the Edentata. However it quite early became clear that such a classification was hard to sustain, and there was a growing trend to see the features as examples of convergent evolution. For example, at the start of the 20th century Frank Evers Beddard, writing in The Cambridge Natural History, Vol 10, Mammalia, having discussed some discrepant features, said: \"The fact is, that we have here a polymorphic order which contains in all probability representatives of at least two separate orders.
