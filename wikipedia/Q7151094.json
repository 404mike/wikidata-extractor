One of Weitz's most notable students was Nicholas Danby (1935\u20131997) who succeeded him as the church organist in 1967. Danby was also a tutor and taught John Keys, Paul Hale, and Robert Costin.

In 1902 Casson installed a 46-stop organ into William Raeburn Andrew's home at Cathcart House in South Kensington. The National Pipe Organ Register attributes this to Casson himself rather than to the Positive Organ Co. Other extant examples of large organs by Casson include an early, 1880s, two-manual one at All Saints, Thorpe Malsor, described by the organist Paul Hale as \"much the most spectacular nineteenth century organ in any village church\". Another early, 1889, example from the Casson's Patent Organ Co era, is at St Mary's Church, Redgrave, Suffolk, (redundant, and in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust). A c 1900 organ, also attributed to Casson rather than to the Positive Organ Company, was at St George's Hotel, Llandudno, but is now located at Bethania Methodist Chapel, Eglwysbach, and is the only two-manual Casson in Wales. A four-manual organ was installed around 1900 in the London Organ School and College of Music later merging in to become part of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (better known as LAMDA). The organ was removed in 1921."]}, {"page": "Hale, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Hale"]}]}}
