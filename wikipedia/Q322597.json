They scored nine top 20 UK singles in five years, but were among the most popular British bands not to find any real success in the United States. For most of their career the Move were led by guitarist, singer and songwriter Roy Wood. He wrote all the group's UK singles and, from 1968, also sang lead vocals on many songs. Initially, the band had four main vocalists (Wood, Carl Wayne, Trevor Burton and Chris \"Ace\" Kefford) who divided amongst themselves the lead vocal duties.", "The Move evolved from several mid-1960s Birmingham-based groups, including Carl Wayne & the Vikings, the Nightriders and the Mayfair Set. Their name referred to the move various members of these bands made to form the group. Besides Wood, the Move's original five-piece line-up in 1965 was drummer Bev Bevan, bassist Ace Kefford, vocalist Carl Wayne and guitarist Trevor Burton. The final line-up of 1972 was a trio of Wood, Bevan and Jeff Lynne, all of whom had for two years been working in the parallel project the Electric Light Orchestra. ", "The Move were formed in December 1965, and played their debut show at the Belfry, Wishaw, on 23 January 1966. The original intentions of Trevor Burton, Ace Kefford and Roy Wood were to start a group from among Birmingham's best musicians\u2014along similar lines to the Who. The three played together at jam sessions at Birmingham's Cedar Club, and invited Carl Wayne and Bev Bevan to join their new group. After a debut at the Bell Hotel in Stourbridge in January 1966, and further bookings around the Birmingham area, Moody Blues manager Tony Secunda offered to manage them. At the time, the Move mainly played covers of American west coast groups such as the Byrds together with Motown and rock 'n' roll songs. Many of the band's selections for their songs came from the extensive record collection of Danny King, a former bandmate of Burton. Although Carl Wayne handled most of the lead vocals, all the band members shared harmonies, and each was allowed at least one lead vocal per show (and often traded lead vocals within specific songs).Brumbeat: The Move. Retrieved 11 November 2009.", "As a direct consequence of the lawsuit, the Move fired Secunda and hired Don Arden, who had himself recently been fired as manager of the Small Faces. In a 2000 interview, Wayne noted that there had always been a major split within the group about Secunda's tactics: \"[Secunda] had the animals who would do what he wanted to do in Trevor, Ace, and me\u2014the fiery part of the stage act. I think Roy would obviously qualify this himself, but I believe he was slightly embarrassed by the image and the stunts\u2014but the rest of us weren't ...

Sheridan, feeling that the band had come full circle, decided to depart the group shortly thereafter\u2014although Sheridan later toured with various musicians using the Nightriders' moniker. The losses of Sheridan and Wood led the band to change direction. The band shortened their name to the Nightriders (dropping Sheridan's name), reflecting the fact that the band was now going to lack a dedicated frontman and would feature various members performing lead vocals. Shortly after signing a new recording contract with Polydor Records, Mann departed and was replaced by Jeff Lynne, who at the time was an unknown guitar prodigy from the Birmingham district of Shard End. Their time at Polydor was short, and they recorded only one single, \"It's Only The Dog\"/\"Your Friend\", released in November 1966, with Lynne on lead guitar.
