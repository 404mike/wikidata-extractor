Hugh Broughton, who was the most highly regarded English Hebraist of his time but had been excluded from the panel of translators because of his utterly uncongenial temperament, issued in 1611 a total condemnation of the new version. He especially criticized the translators' rejection of word-for-word equivalence and stated that \"he would rather be torn in pieces by wild horses than that this abominable translation (KJV) should ever be foisted upon the English people\". Walton's London Polyglot of 1657 disregards the Authorized Version (and indeed the English language) entirely. Walton's reference text throughout is the Vulgate. The Vulgate Latin is also found as the standard text of scripture in Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan of 1651, indeed Hobbes gives Vulgate chapter and verse numbers (e.g., Job 41:24, not Job 41:33) for his head text. In Chapter 35: The Signification in Scripture of Kingdom of God, Hobbes discusses Exodus 19:5, first in his own translation of the Vulgar Latin, and then subsequently as found in the versions he terms \"... the English translation made in the beginning of the reign of King James\", and \"The Geneva French\" (i.e. Oliv\u00e9tan). Hobbes advances detailed critical arguments why the Vulgate rendering is to be preferred. For most of the 17th century the assumption remained that, while it had been of vital importance to provide the scriptures in the vernacular for ordinary people, nevertheless for those with sufficient education to do so, Biblical study was best undertaken within the international common medium of Latin. It was only in 1700 that modern bilingual Bibles appeared in which the Authorized Version was compared with counterpart Dutch and French Protestant vernacular Bibles."]}, {"page": "Puritans", "response": ["David Brady describes a \"lull before the storm\" in the early 17th century, in which \"reasonably restrained and systematic\" Protestant exegesis of the Book of Revelation was seen with Brightman, Mede, and Hugh Broughton, after which \"apocalyptic literature became too easily debased\" as it became more populist and less scholarly. William Lamont argues that, within the church, the Elizabethan millennial beliefs of John Foxe became sidelined, with Puritans adopting instead the \"centrifugal\" doctrines of Thomas Brightman, while the Laudians replaced the \"centripetal\" attitude of Foxe to the \"Christian Emperor\" by the national and episcopal Church closer to home, with its royal head, as leading the Protestant world iure divino (by divine right). Viggo Norskov Olsen writes that Mede \"broke fully away from the Augustinian-Foxian tradition, and is the link between Brightman and the premillennialism of the 17th century\". The dam broke in 1641 when the traditional retrospective reverence for Thomas Cranmer and other martyred bishops in the Acts and Monuments was displaced by forward-looking attitudes to prophecy among radical Puritans."]}, {"page": "1612", "response": ["* August 4 \u2013 Hugh Broughton, English scholar (b. 1549)"]}, {"page": "1612 in literature", "response": ["*August 4 \u2013 Hugh Broughton, English Biblical scholar (born 1549)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Morton (bishop)", "response": ["In 1602 he was selected, with Richard Crakanthorpe as his colleague, to accompany Ralph Eure, 3rd Baron Eure when sent by Elizabeth as ambassador extraordinary to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and Christian IV of Denmark.

Bilson's literal views on the descent of Christ into Hell were orthodox for \"conformist\" Anglicans of the time, while the Puritan wing of the church preferred a metaphorical or spiritual reading.Bruce Gordon, Peter Marshall, The Place of the Dead: Death and Remembrance in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe (2000), pp. 118\u20139. He maintained that Christ went to hell, not to suffer, but to wrest the keys of hell out of the Devil's hands. For this doctrine he was severely handled by Henry Jacob and also by other Puritans. Hugh Broughton, a noted Hebraist, was excluded from the translators of the King James Bible, and became a vehement early critic. The origin of Broughton's published attack on Bilson as a scholar and theologian, from 1604,Declaration of general corruption, of religion, Scripture, and all learninge: wrought by D. Bilson. is thought to lie in a sermon Bilson gave in 1597, which Broughton, at first and wrongly, thought supported his own view that hell and paradise coincided in place. From another direction the Roman Catholic controversialist Richard Broughton also attacked Anglican conformists through Bilson's views, writing in 1607.Willem Nijenhuis, Adrianus Saravia (c. 1532 \u2013 1613): Dutch Calvinist, First Reformed Defender of the English Episcopal Church Order on the Basis of the Ius Divinum (1980), p. 182.Charles W.

His reservations were set out in An Admonition touching Talmudique allegations, which was appended to An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes. Here he made clear that one of his motivations in using Jewish sources was to employ them controversially against Judaism.An Admonition, p. 339. The interest in Judaism, its Scripture and its intellectual traditions was spreading within Dutch Calvinist culture and Leiden University was at its centre. Joseph Justus Scaliger had pioneered Semitic studies there and in 1625 the university press acquired an oriental section, with fonts for a range of Afroasiatic languages, on the initiative of the House of Elzevir.Boxer, p. 178.
