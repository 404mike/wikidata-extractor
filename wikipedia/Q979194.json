Finitely presented torsion-free infinite simple groups were constructed by Burger and Mozes."]}, {"page": "Presentation of a group", "response": ["Every finitely presented group is recursively presented, but there are recursively presented groups that cannot be finitely presented.  However a theorem of Graham Higman states that a finitely generated group has a recursive presentation if and only if it can be embedded in a finitely presented group. From this we can deduce that there are (up to isomorphism) only countably many finitely generated recursively presented groups. Bernhard Neumann has shown that there are uncountably many non-isomorphic two generator groups. Therefore, there are finitely generated groups that cannot be recursively presented."]}, {"page": "Finite group", "response": ["If n is the square of a prime, then there are exactly two possible isomorphism types of group of order n, both of which are abelian.
