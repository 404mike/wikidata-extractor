Inside he repaired the original roof and wooden belfry but removed the west gallery and added a new nave, chancel and sanctuary. On the exterior, he changed the design to reflect the popular Gothic Revival architecture at the time. In doing so he added a vestry, transepts and a new spire for the bell tower. A memorial to Joseph Baker, for whom Mount Baker in Washington state, United States is named, was installed in the chapel of the church as he had retired to Presteigne. A 13th-century coffin lid, possibly from a member of the Mortimer Family, is also installed in the north side of the church. It was granted Grade II*-listed status in 1985 for being \"a virtually complete example of the rural work of Sir George Gilbert Scott's office; whilst the church does retain significant medieval fabric, the consistency and coherence of its restoration make it a remarkably clear statement of Ecclesiological principles.\"<Ref name=list />"]}, {"page": "1874 Dissolution Honours", "response": ["*Richard Green-Price, of Norton Manor, in the parish of Norton, in the county of Radnor"]}, {"page": "Green-Price, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Green-Price"]}]}}
