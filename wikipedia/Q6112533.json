During the second half of the 1928\u201329 campaign, Ridley found his appearances limited as he shared the outside-left position with Tom Carmedy and Jack Fletcher. On 2 March 1929, he scored the only goal of the game as Nelson beat Carlisle United at Seedhill. In total, Ridley scored 7 goals in 31 league matches for the Lancashire club, netting his last goal in the final match of the season, a 4\u20134 draw with Accrington Stanley.
