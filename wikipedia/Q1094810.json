In reaction to this article, many women filmmakers integrated \"alternative forms and experimental techniques\" to \"encourage audiences to critique the seemingly transparent images on the screen and to question the manipulative techniques of filming and editing\".Erens, Patricia. \u201cIntroduction\u201d Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.

Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists on either side of the Atlantic. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, Women and Film. Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution."]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1940\u20131999||data-sort-value=\"Johnston, Claire\"|Claire Johnston||United Kingdom||1940||1987||||"]}, {"page": "Film studies", "response": ["*Claire Johnston"]}, {"page": "Direct cinema", "response": ["*Claire Johnston, \"Women's Cinema as Counter-Cinema\" (1975) in: Sue Thornham (ed.), Feminist Film Theory.
