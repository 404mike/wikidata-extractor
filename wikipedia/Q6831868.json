Michael Kidner was one of its earliest and most consistent exponents and it was in these overlapping fields of optical effect and systemic structure that he was to find the creative substance that was to sustain his whole career. A Constructivist by inclination his interest in mathematics, chaos and wave theories informed an art that is both rational and intuitive. Without losing his rigorous, intellectual approach, Kidner manages to make his work resonate emotionally.Throughout his life he retained an interest in unpredictable world events that provoked unplanned elements within his work but he somehow managed to intimate an underlying order through his use of form and colour.\n\nUnless you read a painting as a feeling, then you don't get anything at all", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Michael Kidner (1917\u20132009)"]}, {"page": "Cyprus College of Art", "response": ["* Michael Kidner, RA"]}, {"page": "Stass Paraskos", "response": ["When Canterbury College of Art was renamed Kent Institute of Art & Design, Paraskos was appointed a Senior Lecturer in Fine Art and then Head of Painting, before returning to Cyprus in 1989 to run the Cyprus College of Art with his daughter Margaret Paraskos.David Haste, Stass at Canterbury, in Michael Paraskos (ed), Stass Paraskos (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2009) 36f Using his connections in the British art world, Paraskos was able to bring a large number of well-known international artists to the Cyprus College of Art, including Anthony Caro, Dennis Creffield, Jennifer Durrant, Terry Frost, Clive Head, Michael Kidner, Mali Morris, Euan Uglow, Rachel Whiteread and others, as well as many hundreds of art students from Britain and elsewhere, resulting in what John Cornall, writing in The London Magazine in 1996, called the discernable influence of Cypriot elements in British art during the period.John Cornall, 'Earth wisdom : Cypriot connections in British art : Geoffrey Rigden & Stass Paraskos' in The London Magazine, February 1996"]}, {"page": "Bedales School", "response": ["*Michael Kidner (born 1917\u20132009), op artist"]}, {"page": "Harry Thubron", "response": ["Thubron also organised by this time a series of \"summer schools\" in Yorkshire and Norfolk, in which he shared his ideas on art education with teachers, students and artists who came from all over the country, markedly influencing an entire generation of creators as Hoyland, Sausmarez, Bridget Riley and Michael Kidner."]}, {"page": "Gillian Wise", "response": ["Before she graduated, Wise was already showing works with a group of Constructionist artists, exhibiting at the 1957 Young Contemporaries exhibition at the Royal British Artists gallery and in the New Vision Centre's abstract show in 1958. In 1961 she became the youngest member of the Constructionist group, centred on Victor Pasmore and including Adrian Heath, John Ernest, Anthony Hill, Kenneth Martin, and Mary Martin. In the 1960s her work became much more widely shown with exhibitions in London (at the Drian and Axiom galleries, the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Victoria and Albert Museum), in Chicago, and at the 1965 Tokyo Biennale and the 1969 Nuremberg Biennale.  In 1968, she gained a UNESCO Fellowship award to study in Prague, followed in 1969 by a British Council scholarship to study Russian constructivism in Leningrad. In Leningrad she met and married an architect, Adrian Ciobotaru.  In the same year she exhibited with a group of British artists in an exhibition of systems-based abstraction in Finland, followed in 1970 by her joining many of the same artists in the newly formed Systems Group and quitting the Constructionist group.  Her fellow artists in that group included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Malcolm Hughes, Jean Spencer, Michael Kidner, John Ernest, and David Saunders. She exhibited with the group in Matrix at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol in 1970, and then in 1972, at the Whitechapel Gallery in the Arts Council's Systems exhibition.

He was interviewed by the film-maker Brian De Palma (1940\u2013) for his documentary about the exhibition. ", "Steele was a founder member of the Systems group of artists along with Malcolm Hughes (1920\u20131997) in December 1969. The group included Michael Kidner, Gillian Wise (1936\u2013), Peter Lowe (1938\u2013), Colin Jones (1934\u2013), David Saunders (1936\u2013), Jean Spencer (1942\u20131998), Richard Allen (1933\u201399), John Ernest (1922\u20131994) and others. The group arose through an exhibition of nine artists, \"Systeemi-System\", organised by Steele and his then wife, the textile designer Arja Nenonen (1936\u20132011), at the Amos Anderson Museum in Helsinki, capital of Nenonen's native Finland, in 1969. The exhibition was subtitled by Steele \"An Exhibition of Syntactic Art from Britain\", the word \"syntactic\" referring to the work \"being constructed from a vocabulary of largely geometric forms in accordance with pre-determined and often mathematically-based systems\". The Helsinki show was followed by a similar one called \"Matrix\" at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol and the 1972/3 Arts Council touring exhibition \"Systems\" which opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in March 1972. This was followed by \"Systems II\" at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1973. Individual members showed at the Lucy Milton gallery in Notting Hill, London, up to 1975, and in continental Europe during the 1970s and afterwards. The group ceased to exist in 1976 following political disagreements, but a number of its members remained on friendly terms and exhibited together.Fowler, \"Constructive and Systems Art in Britain after the Second World War\", in the catalogue for \"Elements of Abstraction: Space Space, Line & Interval in Modern British Art\", at Southampton City Art Gallery, September 2005."]}, {"page": "Ernest Edmonds", "response": ["The show included works by Harold Cohen, Anthony Hill, Malcolm Hughes, Michael Kidner, William Latham, Kenneth Martin, Mary Martin, Jeffrey Steele, Sean Clark and Susan Tebby."]}, {"page": "Kidner, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Kidner"]}, {"page": "List of people from Kettering", "response": ["* Michael Kidner \u2013 pioneer of Op art"]}, {"page": "Jean Spencer (artist)", "response": ["As an artist, Spencer had her first solo exhibition at the Bear Lane Gallery in Oxford in 1965 and a second exhibition, at the University of Sussex, followed in 1969. During the 1960s, Spencer often produced cubes in relief form, with proportions based on a mixture of mathematical rules and her own intuition. Later in life she focussed on painting and the use of bold blocks of colour. In 1967 Spencer was a prize winner at the annual John Moores exhibition in Liverpool. Spencer exhibited with a group of British artists concerned with systems-based abstraction, the Systems Group, that included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Michael Kidner as well as Malcolm Hughes. Her work was shown widely in Europe between 1969 and 1973 as part of various Systems Group exhibitions. In Britain, her work was included in the 1972 Arts Council touring exhibition of Systems Group artworks. During 1977 and 1978, Spencer produced a series of publications, Working Information, featuring drawings and designs by Systems Group and other Systematic-Constructive artists. She then spent a year at the University of Sussex studying the History and Theory of Art for her M.A. Spencer was an active member of the group behind the Exhibiting Space series of multi-disciplinary collaborations held in Whitechapel in 1983 and was included in the 1986 exhibition Colour Presentations at the Gardner Centre Gallery at the University of Sussex, which then toured Britain."]}, {"page": "Kidner", "response": ["*Michael Kidner (1917\u20132009), British artist"]}]}}
