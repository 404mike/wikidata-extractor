Blair, director of the Signal Corps Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. While most of the Corps' efforts revolved around infra-red detection systems (a popular idea at the time), as well as a newer generation of sound detectors, they also maintained a small program of research on microwave radars based on the \"beat principle\", in which an aircraft would cause two signals to interfere. Low generator efficiency and a lack of ranging capability made these efforts impractical."]}, {"page": "William Blair", "response": ["*William R.

In the interest of \u201ceconomy and efficiency,\u201d the National Bureau of Standards moved the Signal Corps Electrical Laboratory, the Signal Corps Meteorological Laboratory, and the Signal Corps Laboratory at the Bureau of Standards to Fort Monmouth. Upon arriving at their destination, the research facilities were combined with the Radio Laboratory already at Fort Monmouth to form what became known as the Signal Corps Laboratories. In 1930, the Signal Corps transferred the Subaqueous Sound Ranging Laboratory from Fort H. G. Wright, New York to Fort Monmouth as well. On June 30, 1930, the SCL had a personnel strength of 5 officers, 12 enlisted men, and 53 civilians. Major (Dr.) William R. Blair was named Director."]}, {"page": "Radar in World War II", "response": ["Taylor's 1930 report had been passed on to the U.S. Army's Signal Corps Laboratories (SCL). Here, William R. Blair had projects underway in detecting aircraft from thermal radiation and sound ranging, and started a project in Doppler-beat detection. Following Page's success with pulse-transmission, the SCL soon followed in this area. In 1936, Paul E. Watson developed a pulsed system that on December 14 detected aircraft flying in New York City airspace at ranges up to seven miles. By 1938, this had evolved into the Army's first Radio Position Finding (RPF) set, designated SCR-268, Signal Corps Radio, to disguise the technology. It operated at 200\u00a0MHz 1.5 m, with 7-kW peak power. The received signal was used to direct a searchlight."]}, {"page": "September 1962", "response": ["*Died: William R.
