This original preliminary version saw the two experts - David Harper and Kate Bliss - each driving a classic car, and free to roam where they chose within a \"work-day\" time limit (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) to buy up antiques with their \u00a3200 budget, with the goal of making the most profit when entered into auction two days later. They were encouraged to spend the entirety of their \u00a3200, even if it meant using any leftover on small antique trinkets, with potential penalty for not spending enough by deducting a percentage from profits. In this version, the experts only interacted at the outset of the episode and at the final auction, and the episode was 'self contained' - i.e. it wasn't part of a week-long trip. Potential was seen in the format for a series, but several tweaks were made. It was decided to have the two experts travel around together in the same car, allowing for interaction between the pair, and it was decided to make the 'road trip' span five days, and with a more designated overall route. The goal of spending the entire budget or being penalised, was also dropped. In the original pilot, each expert could nominate any proceeds to be donated to a charity of their choice; in the actual series Children in Need became the solo umbrella charity for any proceeds."]}, {"page": "For What It's Worth (game show)", "response": ["Kate Bliss,"]}]}}
