She became a professor in the Politics Department at Lancaster University not long after its inception, later moving to Keele University where she remained until her retirement in 2002.\nCanovan published several books but is perhaps best known for her work on Hannah Arendt, particularly after accessing Arendt's unpublished papers in the late 1980s. Her book Hannah Arendt: A Reinterpretation of Her Political Thought (1992) was described by Gordon Tolle in The Review of Politics as \"an excellent and comprehensive explanation of how Arendt's political theory emerges out of her early struggle to understand the new phenomenon of totalitarianism\".Her later work on nationalism was also received with international acclaim. Steven Engel noted that \"Canovan's book distinguishes itself in that its aim is 'to argue that questions of nationhood are not an optional extra for political theory, but should actually be at the heart of the discipline' \".   Bernard Yack credits Canovan with arguing that \"national loyalties help liberals establish a sense of intergenerational continuity\" that is difficult to establish via mere civic membership, and that this intergenerational \"bond\" is essential in maintaining \"continuity and stability\" in a democratic polity. She published at least four essays on populism, and was regarded as a \"true pioneer\" in its study.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Audlem", "response": ["* Margaret Canovan (1939\u20132018), political theorist, lived in Audlem from 1979 to 2003 while working at Keele University."]}, {"page": "Populism", "response": ["Although the term began as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as \"populists\". As noted by the political scientist Margaret Canovan, \"there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings.\" In this it differs from other political terms, like \"socialism\" or \"conservatism\", which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word. Instead it shares similarities with terms such as \"far left\", \"far right\", or \"extremist\", which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* Margaret Canovan"]}, {"page": "The Human Condition", "response": ["The Human Condition was first published in 1958.
