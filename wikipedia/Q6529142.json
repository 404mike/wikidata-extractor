He was born in Norton St Philip, Somerset and died at Bath, Somerset.\nA right-handed opening batsman, Angell made a lot of runs in club cricket for the Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, but his record in first-class cricket was less successful. He played for Somerset in matches at Bath in both 1947 and 1948, and in a few more games in 1949, before joining the county club's staff in 1950. Playing mostly as the opening partner to the ebullient Harold Gimblett, Angell was a restrained, neat batsman and made 933 runs in his first full season, though his average was only 20 and he passed 50 only three times. There was a very similar record in 1951, with 975 runs, again at an average of 20. In 1952, Angell made his highest score of 90 in the match against Derbyshire at Derby. But three weeks later he was dropped from the side and, as Somerset hit the bottom of the County Championship table for what would prove to be the first of four consecutive last-place finishes, he was not re-engaged at the end of the 1952 season.\nIn 1954, however, with Gimblett retiring suddenly at the start of the season, Angell was recalled to Somerset and proceeded to have his best season in first-class cricket. He scored 1,125 runs at an average of 22.95 and made his highest score (and only first-class century) of 114 in the match against the Pakistanis. Apart from this innings, his highest score for the season was an unbeaten 62. He was less successful again in 1955, and after seven matches in 1956 he left the staff for good.\nHe continued to be a heavy scorer in club cricket into his late 40s. By profession, he was an engineering draughtsman for a Bath company. He died on 9 October 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Angell", "response": ["* Les Angell (1922\u20132014), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Les Angell (1947\u20131956) 132 matches CA"]}, {"page": "David Kitson (cricketer)", "response": ["Kitson was one of several Yorkshire League cricketers recruited by Somerset to bolster the county's fragile batting in the early 1950s, when the county finished bottom of the County Championship for four consecutive seasons. He played fairly regularly in 1953, when the county had temporarily dispensed with the services of Les Angell as Harold Gimblett's opening partner, and scored 589 runs in the season at an average of 17.84. His highest score was an innings of 69 against Leicestershire at Leicester in 1953. Angell returned to Somerset in 1954 and though Gimblett was unable to play, Kitson did not retain his place in the team and left the staff at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Lansdown Cricket Club", "response": ["Lansdown has had a number of talented professionals through the years.  The Somerset opener Tom Young spent some time at the club in 1910, and the brothers Jack and Frank Lee played for the club while qualifying for Somerset in the 1920s.  In the postwar years, the mainstay of the batting for many years was Les Angell, whose prolific scoring for Lansdown masked a more modest record in first-class cricket for Somerset. Almost overlapping with Angell, in 1973, Viv Richards similarly turned out for the side while he served his qualification period for Somerset.  During his time at the club he not only entertained the crowd with his runs, but also cut the grass for the club."]}, {"page": "Eric Hill (cricketer)", "response": ["Hill lost his place in the side towards the end of the season when Somerset's amateur contingent was more readily available, but resumed his opening partnership with Gimblett at the start of the 1949 season, with similar results: an aggregate of 718 runs at an average of 18.41, and a regular place in the side until the end of July. Somerset's hopes for Hill were shown by the award of his county cap: \"It was hoped that Hill would develop into an ideal partner for Gimblett, but after being awarded his county cap for consistent displays he fell away to a surprising degree,\" Wisden reported. He was out of form in 1950 as well, playing only six matches and making only 67 runs, and Les Angell emerged from club cricket in Bath for Lansdown as a more regular opening partner for Gimblett."]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Les Angell, 92, cricketer (Somerset)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2014", "response": ["*Les Angell, 92, English cricketer (Somerset).Somerset mourning the loss of Les Angell "]}, {"page": "Frederick Leslie Angell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Les Angell"]}, {"page": "Leslie Angell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Les Angell"]}]}}
