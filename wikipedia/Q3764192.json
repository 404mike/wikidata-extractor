His works are found in a number of Tudor manuscript collections of church music, including the Pepys Manuscript; there is also an antiphon by his hand in the Eton Choirbook. Stylistically the work is similar to those of William Horwood in the same book, but is unusual in that it is written to a prose text. Two poems have been ascribed to Banester, the Miracle of St Thomas of 1467 and a translation of Boccaccio, dating to 1450, that is the first known in the English language.Little else is known of Banester's life. He was recorded as the \"king's servant\" in 1471. In addition, it is known that Edward IV provided him with corrodies for two Abbeys, and he was made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1475. In 1478, he became master of the choristers. He died in 1487.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["|Gilbert Banester || c. 1445 || 1487 ||"]}, {"page": "Eton Choirbook", "response": ["Stylistically, the music contained in the Eton Choirbook shows three phases in the development of early Renaissance polyphony in England.  The first phase is represented by the music of Richard Hygons, William Horwood and Gilbert Banester.  Most of the music of this early phase is polyphonic but non-imitative, with contrast achieved by alternation of full five-voice texture with sections sung by fewer voices.  The second phase, which includes music by John Browne, Richard Davy and Walter Lambe, uses imitation, cantus firmus techniques, and frequent cross-relations (a feature which was to become a distinctive sound in early Tudor polyphony).  The final phase represented in the choirbook includes music by William Cornysh and Robert Fayrfax, composed around 1500.  Points of imitation are frequent, cantus firmus techniques disappear, and in general the sound of the music is more Continental.", "* 35.  f. 71v-74: O Maria et Elisabeth - Gilbert Banester", "The composers represented in the manuscript are: John Browne (10 works), Richard Davy (9), Walter Lambe (8), Robert Wilkinson (7), William Cornysh (5), William Horwood (4), Robert Fayrfax (2), John Fawkyner (2), Nicholas Huchyn (2), Hugh Kellyk (2), Edmund Turges (2), Gilbert Banester, Brygeman (1), Robert Hacomplaynt (1), John Hampton (1), Holynborne (1), Richard Hygons (1), Nesbet (1), Edmund Sturton (1), John Sutton (1), Sygar (1) and William Stratford (1)."]}, {"page": "Gilbert Banastre", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gilbert Banester"]}, {"page": "Banester", "response": ["*Gilbert Banester ( 1445\u20131487), English composer and poet"]}, {"page": "Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal", "response": ["* 1478 Gilbert Banester"]}, {"page": "Gentleman of the Chapel Royal", "response": ["* Gilbert Banester"]}, {"page": "Gilbert Banaster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gilbert Banester"]}, {"page": "Gilbert Banastir", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gilbert Banester"]}]}}
