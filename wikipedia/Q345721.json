Its patronage and popularity did not, however, free it from corruption, heavy betting, and staged fights. Byrne fought eight recorded matches, but accounts of his career focus on the last three, against the Scottish champion Alexander McKay, the English champion Jem Ward, and James Burke for the vacant championship of England. The injuries McKay received in his fight with Byrne resulted in his death the following day, and rioting in his home country of Scotland. Byrne went on to lose his next match against Jem Ward, which some commentators believed he was not sufficiently in condition to fight. His final contest in May 1833 was a gruelling 99\u00a0rounds against James Burke that lasted for 3\u00a0hours and 6\u00a0minutes, the longest ever recorded prize fight. Byrne died three days later as the result of damage to his brain caused by the beating he had received.", "Boxing had become a nest of \"gambling related corruption\" by the 1820s. The epitome of this era was the championship reign of Jem Ward, a fighter who on one occasion admitted taking \u00a3100, equivalent to several thousand pounds today, to lose a contest. By 1830 the sport had become widely known for its corruption, and blatant cheating was commonplace. It was against this background that Simon Byrne earned his living.", "The fight against Alexander McKay was Byrne's first brush with notoriety. On 2 June 1830, Byrne, billed as \"Champion of Ireland\", fought McKay, the \"Champion of Scotland\", for the right to challenge Jem Ward, the heavyweight champion of England. The match had been organized at Tom Spring's \"Castle Tavern\", in Holborn. The former champion boxer Tom Spring, as treasurer of the \"Fair Play Club\"\u00a0\u2013 the organization which oversaw boxing\u00a0\u2013 was immensely influential in the boxing world. Along with two other well-known boxers, Gentleman Jackson and Tom Cribb (who also acted as Byrne's manager), he was Byrne's sponsor for the match. Cribb was considered to be one of the greatest fighters of the era; more than 20,000\u00a0people attended one of his fights.", "Cleared of any responsibility for McKay's death, Byrne collected his \u00a3200 prize money, and as the winner earned the right to fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829, but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight, much to the disapproval of his backers and friends. Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of \u00a3250 plus an additional \u00a3250 if he lost; the event became known in some quarters as the Leicester Hoax. Ward did not fight again for two years, but he and Byrne finally met on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. Each fighter was paid \u00a3200. Although Ward was the older man he prevailed in the contest after one hour and seventeen minutes, when Byrne's seconds, Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds, withdrew their man in the 33rd round.", "Jem Ward announced his retirement from the ring in a letter published in the 29 January edition of Bell's Life in London. He was succeeded as champion of England by James Burke, although some disputed Burke's right to the title as Ward had refused to fight him before retiring. Standing  tall, weighing 200\u00a0lb (90\u00a0kg), and handicapped by deafness, Burke had assumed the championship after defeating Harry Macone in one of the prolonged and brutal fights for which he was known. Ward, who had faced public criticism for his refusal to fight Burke, felt that Byrne was the better fighter and promised to acknowledge the victor of a fight between Burke and Byrne as the new champion. The match took place on 30 May 1833 on Nomansland, a tract of common land between the villages of Sandridge and Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire, for a prize of \u00a3100 to each man. To get himself into condition for the fight, Byrne had reduced his weight from  to , an effort that \"as it was effected by hard work and sweating, somewhat impaired his natural stamina, especially as, his habits being far from abstemious when in Ireland, he was scarcely fitted to undergo the necessary amount of labour\". Despite his hard work Byrne looked \"fleshy\", with \"no special show of muscle\", compared to Burke's \"perfect condition\", although he did have a slight height advantage. Burke weighed in at , and started the contest as the marginal favourite at odds of 5\u20134.", "Tom Spring was once again in Byrne's corner, as was Jem Ward. In true Burke style the match lasted for 3\u00a0hours and 6\u00a0minutes, during which time 99\u00a0rounds were fought the longest ever recorded prize fight. For the most part Byrne seemed to be in control in the early stages of the fight; in the 30th round he trapped Burke against the ropes and battered him severely around the body before throwing him to the ground. Burke fell on his face, vomiting and throwing up blood, and for the next few rounds Byrne looked the more likely winner. By the 49th round however, Burke had recovered sufficiently to knock Byrne to the ground, whose hands by then were so swollen that he was unable to deliver a finishing blow. By the 93rd round Byrne was \"scarcely able to stand, and rolled before the Deaf'un like a ship in a storm\". Although both men were utterly exhausted Burke continued to \"pepper away at [Byrne's] body and head\", until in the 99th round Byrne collapsed unconscious and could not be revived to take his place once again at the scratch.
