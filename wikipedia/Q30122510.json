In 1964, he signed for Stockport County, where he struck up a good partnership with fellow defender Frank Beaumont, making eighty-four league appearances over two seasons. In 1966, he signed for Macclesfield Town, and it was here where he made his name. Initially used as a right-back, Collins would later switch position to centre-back. Collins enjoyed a successful period at Macclesfield, as the club won the Northern Premier League in 1969 and 1970, the North West Floodlit League in 1970, the FA Trophy in 1970, and the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1969, 1971 and 1973. Individually, he was voted as the club's Player of the Year in 1971.\nCollins' first foray into management came as caretaker of Macclesfield, taking charge of the club during September 1974, following Eddie Brown's departure. In January 1975, Collins again took charge on a caretaker basis, and was later appointed manager, becoming the club's fourth permanent appointment in twelve months. He steered the club to seventeenth place in the league, and in the following season they would progress through the FA Cup qualifying rounds to earn a first round tie against Sheffield Wednesday (then in the Third Division), where they lost 3\u20131 at Hillsborough. In 1976, Collins resigned as manager, having been at the club for the last ten seasons. He comfortably holds the record number of appearances in the Northern Premier League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Collins", "response": ["John Collins may refer to:", "* John Collins (poet) (1742\u20131808), English orator, singer, and poet", "* John Collins (jazz guitarist) (1913\u20132001), American jazz guitarist", "* John Collins (cartoonist) (1917\u20132007), Canadian cartoonist", "* John Collins (theatre director) (born 1969), American experimental theater director", "* John Collins (Australian musician) (born 1971), bass guitarist for Powderfinger", "* John Collins (musician/researcher), musician in the West African music scene", "* John Collins (Canadian musician), musician with the New Pornographers and the Smugglers", "* John Collins (Bengal Army officer) (died 1807), British colonel in the Bengal Native Infantry", "* John Collins (VC) (1880\u20131951), English sergeant who was awarded a Victoria Cross", "* John Collins (Continental Congress) (1717\u20131795), Rhode Island delegate to Continental Congress", "* John Collins (governor) (1776\u20131822), American manufacturer and Governor of Delaware", "* John Collins (Seattle politician) (1835\u20131903), American politician and businessman", "* John Collins (Andover MP) (1624\u20131711), English academic and politician", "* John Collins (Surveyor General) (died 1795), Surveyor General of Provincial Canada", "* John Collins (Canadian politician) (1922\u20132016), physician and politician in Newfoundland, Canada", "* John Collins (Independent minister) (c. 1632\u20131687), English Independent minister", "* John Collins (priest) (1905\u20131982), radical Anglican canon at St Paul's Cathedral", "* John Collins (nuncio) (1889\u20131961), Irish bishop and diplomat in Liberia", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1942), English professional footballer", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1945), English professional footballer and manager", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1949) (1949\u20132020), Welsh professional footballer", "* John Collins (footballer, born 1968), Scottish international footballer and manager", "* John Collins (New Zealand cricketer) (1868\u20131943), New Zealand cricketer", "* John Collins (Fijian cricketer) (fl. 1895), Fijian cricketer", "* John Collins (sports executive) (born 1961), COO of the National Hockey League", "* John Collins (rower) (born 1989), British rower", "* John Collins (basketball) (born 1997), American basketball player in the NBA", "* John Collins (mathematician) (1625\u20131683), English mathematician", "* John Collins (merchant) (died 1795), merchant in Quebec", "* John Collins Covell (1823\u20131887), American educator and school administrator", "* John Collins (British businessman) (born 1941), former head of National Power", "* C.
