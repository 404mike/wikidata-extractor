Originally from Wales, he moved to Southern Rhodesia in 1920 and became an estate agent in Bulawayo. He ran for the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party in Bulawayo District in the 1924 general election, but was not elected. After standing successfully in Bulawayo South in the 1928 election, he sat in the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for 20 years. In 1929 he was elected leader of the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party, thereby becoming Leader of the Opposition, a post he held until 1944.Re-elected in Bulawayo South in the 1933 and 1934 elections, in 1939 Davies switched to the new Hillside constituency in southern Bulawayo, which he won, and held in 1946. On the outbreak of the Second World War he accepted the Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins's offer to come into a national government with ministers from both sides of the House, and served as Minister of Internal Affairs from 1939 to 1943. Davies's co-operation with Huggins infuriated many of his Labour contemporaries and caused an acrimonious split in the party. The two Labour factions reconciled in 1943 and briefly threatened Huggins's premiership, but a heated dispute over whether Labour should become multiracial led to the party's disintegration in 1944. Davies's political career ended after his defeat in Hillside by Julian Greenfield of Huggins's United Party in the 1948 general election. The former Labour leader died in Salisbury on 31 August 1957, at the age of 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhodesia Labour Party", "response": ["At the outbreak of war, Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins offered to appoint the leader of the party, Harry Davies,  to government as part of an all party administration. Davies accepted without consulting the National Executive Committee and was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs on 3 October 1939. The NEC were in fact opposed, although they decided not to raise objections. In 1940, Huggins offered a formal coalition to the party. The NEC rejected this approach, whereupon Davies, John Keller and Thomas Kimble resigned from the party and formed a new party, which they named \"The Labour Party\". Keller was also appointed to the government as Minister without Portfolio. The breakaway was more strongly supported in Bulawayo and Midlands, with Salisbury and Umtali remaining loyal.", "Reunification terms were actually agreed over the winter with the new party called the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party. An inaugural congress was held on 9 January 1944, but Harry Davies walked out half way through, denouncing the congress as unrepresentative because his supporters were outnumbered by about four to one among delegates. A dispute then began over the affiliation of the \"African Headquarters Branch\", to which \"The Labour Party\" were opposed. They pointed to the fact that the affiliation had been agreed despite not complying with regulations whereas a non-compliant branch which supported Davies was refused affiliation."]}, {"page": "Harry Davies", "response": ["Harry Davies may refer to:", "*Harry Davies (footballer, born in Chorley) (fl. 1922\u20131923), English footballer for Chorley, Port Vale and Bacup Borough", "*Harry Davies (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u2013?), English footballer for Doncaster Rovers, Gainsborough Trinity, Hull City and Wolverhampton Wanderers", "*Harry Davies (footballer, born 1888) (1888\u20131958), English footballer for Stoke", "*Harry Davies (footballer, born 1904) (1904\u20131975), English footballer for Huddersfield Town, Port Vale and Stoke City", "*Harry Davies (rugby union) (born 1994), Welsh rugby player", "*Harry Davies (politician) (1878\u20131957), Southern Rhodesian politician", "*Harry Davies (socialist) (1888\u20131927), Welsh socialist politician and trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Southern Rhodesia in World War II", "response": ["On the outbreak of war, Huggins invited the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Harry Davies, to join a coalition government.

Huggins, who remained prime minister, held Beadle in high regard and made him a close associate. In the 1939 election, Beadle won a three-way contest in Bulawayo North with 461 votes out of 869, and became a United Party MP. Beadle was seconded to the Gold Coast Regiment with the rank of temporary captain following the outbreak of the Second World War, but was released from military service at the request of the Southern Rhodesian government to serve as Huggins's Parliamentary Secretary, \"with access to all ministers and top-ranking officials on the PM's business to speed up affairs\". He held this post from 1940 to 1946, during which time he was also Deputy Advocate General for the Southern Rhodesian armed forces.
