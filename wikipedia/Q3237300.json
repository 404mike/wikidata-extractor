The photo shoot, at a studio on the first floor of Peter Cook's Establishment Club, with Morley was to promote a proposed film, The Keeler Affair, that was never released in the United Kingdom. Keeler was reluctant to pose in the nude, but the film producers insisted. Morley persuaded Keeler to sit astride a plywood chair, so that whilst technically she would be nude, the back of the chair would obscure most of her body. Keeler told cartoon historian Tim Benson in 2007 that she was not nude and was, in fact, wearing knickers during the entire photoshoot."]}, {"page": "Barry Humphries", "response": ["In 1959 Humphries moved to London, where he lived and worked throughout the 1960s. He became a friend of leading members of the British comedy scene including Dudley Moore, Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, Spike Milligan, Willie Rushton and fellow Australian expatriate comedian-actors John Bluthal and Dick Bentley. Humphries performed at Cook's comedy venue The Establishment, where he became a friend of and was photographed by leading photographer Lewis Morley, whose studio was located above the club. He contributed to the satirical magazine Private Eye, of which Cook was publisher, his best-known work being the cartoon strip The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie. The bawdy cartoon satire of the worst aspects of Australians abroad was written by Humphries and drawn by New Zealand born cartoonist Nicholas Garland. The book version of the comic strip, published in the late '60s, was for some time banned in Australia."]}, {"page": "Sherbet (band)", "response": ["* Sherbet Slips into Something Comfortable photographed by Lewis Morley for POL October/November 1974.

As well as contemporary photography, Australian pictorialism, modernism and postwar photo documentary is represented by The Sydney Camera Circle, Max Dupain and David Moore. The evolution of 19th-century Australian photography is represented with emphasis on the work of Charles Bayliss and Kerry & Co. International photographs include English pictorialism and the European avant garde (Bauhaus, constructivism and surrealism). Photo-documentary in 20th-century America is reflected through the work of Lewis Hine and Dorothea Lange among others. Contemporary Asian practices are represented by artists such as Yasumasa Morimura and Miwa Yanagi.

The reflections danced and enchanted viewers. Roland Penrose, director of the ICA, was very supportive and arranged to have the work, which included related paintings shown there in 1966. Norbert Lynton, Dennis Bowen, David Bindman and others wrote enthusiastic reviews. Photographers loved the work. Theatrical celebrity photographer Lewis Morley took some wonderful photos of the work as well as many innovative portraits of Benjamin.

Here he would photograph groups visiting London, with London landmarks as the backdrop. This led to street photography when he was commissioned by Marubeni, a Japanese company, to take photos of stylish Londoners in fashionable locations such as Kensington High Street, The King\u2019s Road and Camden Town. Shop windows and stores such as Biba and Vivienne Westwood\u2019s shop Sex were a part of this.
