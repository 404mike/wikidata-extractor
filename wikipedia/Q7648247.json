She had investigated scandals within the Irish meat industry in two films in 1991, setting in motion a three-year Tribunal of Inquiry in Dublin, which found that much of her criticism of the industry was substantiated. The tribunal, though, demanded that she name her informants, and when she refused to do so, she was charged by the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions.  The case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the Republic of Ireland, and in January 1995 she faced trial for contempt of court but was cleared of the charge. O'Keeffe was honoured in the 1994 Freedom of Information Awards for her stand."]}, {"page": "Parachute candidate", "response": ["*Journalist Susan O'Keeffe was described as a parachute candidate by local candidate Veronica Cawley when she stood for Labour in Sligo\u2013North Leitrim at the 2011 general election; O'Keeffe is a native of Dublin but lived in Sligo at the time."]}, {"page": "Mary Ellen Synon", "response": ["When Irish journalist Susan O'Keeffe was brought before the Beef Tribunal for refusing to name her sources, an article Synon wrote about O'Keeffe caused a public outcry: \"Just before the appearance, Ms. Synon wrote in the Sunday Tribune that she would be happy to see Ms O'Keeffe in handcuffs, a remark Ms O'Keeffe's counsel complained about in court\"."]}, {"page": "O'Keeffe", "response": ["* Susan O'Keeffe, Irish politician and journalist"]}, {"page": "List of women in Seanad \u00c9ireann", "response": ["  bar:SusanOKeeffe from:25/05/2011 till:24/04/2016 color:LAB text:\"Susan O'Keeffe (2011\u201316)\""]}]}}
