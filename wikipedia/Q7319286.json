For instance, he appeared in cowboy hat, spurs and sheriff's star on stage, with Morecambe advising Wise that he was \"John Wayne's Son\" - the joke being that Rashley was elderly and clearly several years older than Wayne himself.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edna, the Inebriate Woman", "response": ["* Rex Rashley as Old Man (at The Spike)"]}, {"page": "The Morecambe & Wise Show (1968 TV series)", "response": ["The recurring character, originally billed as Frankie Vaughan's son, appeared regularly in the earlier series and was played by Rex Rashley who also appeared variously as \"John Wayne\" and \"Bob Pope\" in a sketch which involves Little Ern thinking he's going to be Bob Hope's script writer, only for the ageing figure of Rashley to appear through the drapes.  Again, he also appeared in several of the plays at the end of each show, as a sailor in \"Monty on the Bonty\", and variously as a butler, etc., in other shows and hilariously as Robin Hood in one episode from the third series."]}]}}
