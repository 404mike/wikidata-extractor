These were officers who were tasked with probing deep behind the enemy lines to collect information on the enemy. He died, with the rank of Major, leading his men in an attempt to storm a breach at the Siege of Burgos.\nHe was a great favourite of his commander Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, who admired him for his bravery and sharp perception and who took news of his death badly. Wellesley entered (then Colonel) Frederick Ponsonby's room and paced up and down in total silence, much to his junior officers consternation, before stating quietly: \"Cocks is dead\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
