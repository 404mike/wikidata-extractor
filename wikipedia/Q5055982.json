In the 1914 season, he made two appearances for Yorkshire, scoring 47 in his first match against Somerset, and taking useful wickets in the second against Gloucestershire. After the war, Burton played only two more first-class matches: once for the Demobilised Officers' side against a combined Army and Navy team at Lord's in 1919, and then, in 1928, for the amateur Harlequins team that played the 1928 West Indies tourists at Eastbourne."]}, {"page": "David Burton", "response": ["* David Cecil Burton (1887\u20131971), cricketer and captain of Yorkshire CCC"]}, {"page": "Arthur Trollope", "response": ["Trollope's nephews, Cecil Burton and Claude Burton both played first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1919\u20131927)", "response": ["Yorkshire had been hit by a double tragedy in recent years with the deaths of Alonzo Drake (illness) and Major Booth (killed in action during the war) and a rebuilding process was necessary.  The success of Holmes and Sutcliffe went a long way towards completing that process.  Otherwise, Yorkshire relied mainly on their Edwardian veterans George Herbert Hirst, Wilfred Rhodes, David Denton and wicket-keeper Arthur Dolphin.  As always in the era of Lord Hawke, now club president, the team captain was an amateur player and from 1919 to 1921 it was Cecil Burton who filled the role.  Other mainstays of the team that Sutcliffe joined were pace bowler Abe Waddington, all-rounder Roy Kilner and seam bowler Emmott Robinson.
