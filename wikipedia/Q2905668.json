In the 2000s, a quieter style emerged, with largely impressionistic lyrics, from artists such as Norah Jones, Conor Oberst, Sufjan Stevens, David Bazan, South San Gabriel, Iron & Wine, David Gray, Ray LaMontagne, Meg Hutchinson, Darden Smith, Josh Rouse, Steve Millar, Jolie Holland, Patrick Duff, Richard Buckner, Jewel, Jack Savoretti, Richard Shindell, John Gorka, and Antje Duvekot. Some started to branch out in new genres such as Kurt Cobain, Noel Gallagher, T Bone Burnett, Eddie Vedder, and Pete Yorn. Others used drugs as a mind-altering way to boost creativity; for example, Emil Amos of Holy Sons took drugs daily from age sixteen on, wrote over 1,000 songs, and landed a record contract with an indie label."]}, {"page": "Pinkpop Festival", "response": ["| - Jack Savoretti  - My Baby  - The Charm The Fury  - Birdy  - Rancid", "- Jack Savoretti"]}, {"page": "Peace One Day", "response": ["In 2019, Jeremy Gilley and Jude Law produced the Peace One Day 20th Anniversary Celebration at the Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London.
