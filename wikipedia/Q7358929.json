He scored his first goal for Swindon in a match with Queens Park Rangers on 1 September.\nSmart was relegated to the reserves for much of the 1962\u201363 season, before being recalled for the final three games of the season. He scored in each of these games and assured Swindon's promotion to Division 2 for the first time in their history.In 1965 he became the first nominated substitute to be used in a Swindon Town game.Over the next few seasons, Smart became a first-team regular, moving into a role that allowed fellow striker Don Rogers to excel. Smart's best form came in 1968/69, when he scored fifteen goals. Six of these came in the League Cup campaign, including the opening goal in the 1969 League Cup Final, when he benefited from a mistake in the Arsenal defence before bundling the ball into the net. He created Swindon's second and third goals, both scored by Rogers. He was also a part of the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup and Anglo-Italian League Cup winning sides.\nIn the twilight of his Town career, Smart moved back into a wing-half or midfield position. He left Swindon at the end of the 1972/73 season, and joined Charlton Athletic on a free transfer.He returned to the Swindon area a year later, with spells at Bath City and Trowbridge Town before retiring. As of 1999 he was landlord of the Plough Inn in Old Town, Swindon.\nRoger lives with his partner Lin, on the southern outskirts of Swindon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Ure", "response": ["He moved south of the border in 1963 for a transfer fee of \u00a362,500 to play for Arsenal.

Ure was restored to the Arsenal lineup by Bertie Mee, however, and played 44 matches in 1966\u201367. Ure continued to feature regularly for Arsenal as the 1960s went on, but during this time made a couple of errors in 'big' matches, exemplified by his mistake in the 1969 League Cup Final versus Swindon Town, which allowed Roger Smart to score Swindon's opening goal; Swindon went on to win 3\u20131 after extra time."]}, {"page": "Trowbridge Town F.C.", "response": ["*Roger Smart"]}, {"page": "Bert Head", "response": ["This system produced many future Swindon greats\u00a0\u2013 Trollope, Mike Summerbee, Bobby Woodruff, Ernie Hunt, Keith Morgan, Roger Smart, Rod Thomas, David 'Bronco' Layne and Don Rogers to name but a few\u00a0\u2013 and, as they gradually climbed the league table, the team earned the nickname, \"Bert's Babes\".
