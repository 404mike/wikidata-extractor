He is a right-handed batsman who bowls slow left-arm orthodox spin. He made his international debut for England in July 2016, and has since played all three formats of the game for England, the last in 2018. Dawson was part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, however, he did not play in any matches during the tournament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spin bowling", "response": ["Turn: How much the ball turns after pitching (e.g. 5 degree deviation after meeting the ground). It depends on the number and direction of revolutions of the ball.  The movement and rotation of the ball varies, depending on the position of the wrist and the finger.  An occasional unexpected straight ball can usefully be included in an attack, but spin variation is the main technique used to deceive the batsman and take wickets. A high rate of turn is above 33 rev/second, or 2000 rpm, which Graeme Swann consistently spin over 2000 rpm, the most amongst English spinners until Liam Dawson also topped 35 rev/second, or 2100 rpm. Also, the slower the ball, the more it tends to deviate. For an offspinner, you will have to bowl from wide of off-stump to get the ball to turn into the right-handed batsman and force them to nick off the edge to a fielder or into the top of off stump."]}, {"page": "England cricket team", "response": ["| Liam Dawson ||  || Right-handed || Slow left-arm orthodox || Hampshire || align=center| \u2013 || T20I || align=center| 83 || ||  2017 ||  2018 ||  2022"]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| 35 || Liam Dawson || 2008/9 || 5 || 2 || 0 || 3 || 0"]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["2019 again saw strong performance in first-class cricket as Hampshire finished 3rd in the County Championship, their highest finish in over 10 years.

Ajinkya Rahane also became the first Indian player to represent Hampshire during an overseas spell in June. Hampshire once again also made the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup final, however this year they were defeated in the final by Somerset. There was though success for Hampshire academy graduates James Vince and Liam Dawson as they were part of England's victorious World Cup winning side. Hampshire, though, again failed to progress from the group in T20 cricket. The following 2020 season was heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic with only a shortened localised red ball tournament and T20 played. Hampshire, missing a large number of players to injury, international selection and travel restrictions, struggled winning just two red ball and two white ball games. A large number of young academy players though made their debuts while James Fuller took a hat-trick in a first-class game against Surrey, while overseas player Shaheen Afridi took four wickets in four balls in the final T20 match of the season against Middlesex. West Indian fast bowler Fidel Edwards announced his departure during the season due to not being able to travel due to the restrictions around COVID-19 and the impending change to the Kolpak ruling, after taking over 200 wickets in all formats. 2021 saw a return to the traditional County Championship, although in a differing format, with Hampshire missing out on their first County Championship title since 1973 following a loss to Lancashire in the final match of the season. In Twenty20 cricket, Hampshire made Finals Day following a dramatic 2 run win over Nottinghamshire in the Quarter Final, but lost to Somerset in the semi-finals. Hampshire's List A side was depleted due to The Hundred competition being played alongside the One Day Cup competition. With Hampshire missing 7 players to The Hundred, they missed out on the playoffs, although a number of young players were given the opportunity to play.

England continued their attacking brand of cricket in the ODI series, with the first game of the series ending in a tie after both sides scored 286 from their 50 overs. England won the next match by 10 wickets after a record breaking opening stand from Alex Hales and Jason Roy, before the third game finished in a draw due to rain. England won the fourth game by six wickets, with Jason Roy scoring yet another century, before England won the final game of the series after a strong bowling performance, which included four wickets for David Willey, meaning they won the series 3\u20130.

Four players, Alistair Cook, Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali scored centuries for England in the match. However, they were beaten soundly by 246 in the second game, despite James Anderson and Stuart Broad chipping in with wickets. Due to the poor form of both Ben Duckett and Gary Balance, Jos Buttler played in the third Test as the only other reserve batsman in the squad. England again struggled, having been dismissed for 283 in the first innings before India scored 417. Haseeb Hameed batted well for England in their second innings, although India chased down their small target to win by eight wickets. Following the game, Hameed was ruled out for the rest of the series through injury along with Zafar Ansari. This resulted in Keaton Jennings and Liam Dawson being called up to the squad. Jennings scored a century on his debut in the next Test, but England's bowlers again struggled, with India scoring 631 to win the match by an innings and 36 runs. In the final Test, England posted 477 in their first innings, but India again dominated with the bat, scoring 759/7. England collapsed on the final day, and India won by an innings and 75 runs to win the series 4\u20130."]}]}}
