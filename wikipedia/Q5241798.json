The station's aim was to help listeners relax and put stress behind themselves.  It broadcast 24 hours a day and until September 2019 featured no news bulletins or commercials with only some sponsored programming. Chill originally had no presenters, interspersing tracks with pre-recorded links featuring messages voiced by Davinia Palmer that reinforced the laidback atmosphere of the station. One of these memorably described the station as \"T'ai chi for your ears\". The station encourages interaction with its listeners, who suggest new songs and artists for the playlist, as well as relaxation techniques, via the Chill website and social media."]}, {"page": "List of people from Swansea", "response": ["*Davinia Palmer, radio and TV presenter"]}, {"page": "Free Radio Shropshire & Black Country", "response": ["* Davinia Palmer"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Davinia Palmer (born 1980), television presenter, voice-over artist, now in the United States"]}]}}
