He enjoyed two top twenty hits on the UK Singles Chart - \"You're a Lady\" (1972), which typifies his signature use of brass bands and choral arrangements for a nostalgic and romantic feel, and \"Hold On To Love\" (1975). In the 1980s, Skellern formed the band Oasis with Julian Lloyd Webber and Mary Hopkin and established a musical comedy partnership with Richard Stilgoe in cabaret.\nOver his career, Skellern wrote and performed music for film, television and stage, notably writing and starring in Happy Endings, a 1981 BBC anthology series of comic musical plays. Skellern's songs have been recorded by Andy Williams, Davy Jones, Brigitte Bardot, Ringo Starr and Jack Jones, amongst others. After developing an inoperable brain tumour, Skellern was ordained as a deacon and priest of the Church of England in October 2016. He died four months later.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Polruan", "response": ["Calvin Dean, the actor from the film Tormented grew up in Polruan. Daphne du Maurier once lived in the village.
