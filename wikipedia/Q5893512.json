Jude, was an English composer and organist. Born in Westleton, Suffolk in September 1851, his parents later moved to Norfolk. He was a precocious child, and attended Wisbech Grammar School where records note that by age eight he was composing incidental music for school plays. He later attended Liverpool Organ School and Liverpool College of Music, also becoming college principal for a while.By 1881, Jude was listed in the census as living at 33 Oxford Street, Mount Pleasant, Liverpool with his wife Catherine. At this time, he was organist for the Blue Coat Hospital and Stretford Town Hall near Manchester, as well as being a lecturer and teacher. As a recitalist, he was asked to \"open\" over 1000 new organs across the UK, Ireland and Australia. He was frequently referred to as \"the most brilliant organist of the day\".Christian texts and topics appear frequently in Jude's compositions. He was an admirer of the British evangelist Rodney \"Gipsy\" Smith, and published a collection of Gipsy Smith's Favourite Solos in 1903. Jude appears to have supported the temperance movement; \"Fight the Drink\", a song by Jude with lyrics by A Sargant, appears in a collection of his music with the note that it was \"sung at the Crystal Palace Festival by 5000 people\". Between 1890 and 1894, the composer embarked on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. Beginning in 1904, he served as editor for several musical periodicals, including Monthly Hymnal, Minister of Music, and Music and the Higher Life. He also compiled several hymnbooks; Mission Hymns in 1911 and Festival Hymns in 1916. He died on 8 August 1922 in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisbech", "response": ["*W. H.
