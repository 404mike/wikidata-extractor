The joint discovery of the W and Z bosons by this experiment and the UA2 experiment in 1983 led to the Nobel Prize for physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer in 1984.

There, he and others confirmed charge-parity violation in neutral kaon decay. In 1964, the RAL began a two-decade collaboration with Peter Kalmus's group at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), as well as with groups from Harwell and the University of Bergen amongst others. Experiments were carried out on various weak and strong interactions in the UK and low-energy antiproton-proton experiments at CERN.
