He taught English and history at Omagh Academy for eleven years.Glendinning was a founder of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, and left teaching in 1973 to become its full-time political organiser.  He stood for the party in Mid Ulster at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election and Armagh at the February 1974 general election, but missed election on both occasions.In 1976, Glendinning returned to teaching, working at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, although he remained politically active, campaigning for the Alliance Party into the 1980s, and presenting a submission to the New Ireland Forum in 1983.  He also began writing short stories, some of which were published in the Irish Times, as a result of which he won the Hennessey Award.  Following this, he switched to write plays, several of which were produced for BBC Television and Radio. These early works included The Artist, Condemning Violence, Culture Vultures, Faith, Mumbo Jumbo and Stuffing It.  In 1991, his Donny Boy won \"Best New Play\" at the inaugural TMA Awards, and this success inspired him to again quit teaching, this time to become a full-time writer.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nicholas Hytner", "response": ["|Robin Glendinning"]}, {"page": "Herbert Kappler", "response": ["Kappler's post-war time seeking asylum in the Vatican, and his resultant friendship with his former enemy Monsignor O'Flaherty, was dramatised in the radio play The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican by Robin Glendinning.
