She has stated that she believes that the most likely explanation for lasting symptoms is persisting but slowly resolving functional changes at the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor level. Newer and more detailed brain scanning technologies such as PET scans and MRI scans had as of 2002 to her knowledge never been used to investigate the question of whether benzodiazepines cause functional or structural brain damage."]}, {"page": "List of female scientists in the 20th century", "response": ["* Heather Ashton (1929\u20132019), English psychopharmacologist"]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Heather Ashton FRCP (1929\u20132019), psychopharmacologist and physician best known for her clinical and research work on benzodiazepene dependence"]}, {"page": "List of British women physicians", "response": ["* Heather Ashton (1929\u20132019), physician and psychopharmacologist."]}, {"page": "Chrystal Heather Ashton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Heather Ashton"]}]}}
