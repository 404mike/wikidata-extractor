The philosopher John Forrester described Gr\u00fcnbaum's understanding of science as ahistorical and unrealistic, and argued that Gr\u00fcnbaum misunderstood Freud's view of psychoanalysis. He accused Gr\u00fcnbaum of quoting Freud selectively to support his case, and of ignoring passages in Freud's writings that suggested a hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis. The psychologist Michael Billig noted that, in contrast to Gr\u00fcnbaum, psychologists such as Seymour Fisher, Roger P. Greenberg, and Paul Kline, \"argue that the main elements of Freudian theory have been confirmed.\" The psychotherapist D. Patrick Zimmerman wrote that Gr\u00fcnbaum's conclusions about psychoanalysis have been applied by others to psychodynamic and other forms of verbal psychotherapy. He wrote that critical responses to Gr\u00fcnbaum have not had the same effect on the public as criticism of Freud. He argued that while Gr\u00fcnbaum's arguments were \"bolstered by a reliance upon techniques and findings extrapolated from the field of physics ... his positions were sometimes flawed by basic misunderstandings about either the methods or the conclusions of physics\", and that Gr\u00fcnbaum's criticisms of psychoanalysis applied only to \"classical Freudian\" views and not to more recent \"psychodynamic conceptions\". The philosopher Paul Fusella credited Gr\u00fcnbaum with exposing some of the weaknesses of Habermas's and Ric\u0153ur's interpretations of psychoanalysis. Though maintaining that psychoanalysis \"remains relevant\", he argued that the book left it unclear whether psychoanalysis would be considered pseudoscientific or an empirical science."]}, {"page": "The Memory Wars", "response": ["Webster described The Memory Wars as one of the most trenchant and significant contributions to the debate on recovered-memory therapy. The psychologist Jennifer Freyd wrote that Crews made incorrect claims about Cheit's case and that Cheit himself had objected to Crews's account of how he remembered being sexually abused as a child. She also argued that Crews's understanding of repression was confused and that he was mistaken to claim that Cheit's case was irrelevant to the repressed memory debate. The philosopher John Forrester described Crews's article \"The Unknown Freud\" as a celebrated and widely-read article. He criticized Crews for discussing Gr\u00fcnbaum's criticisms of psychoanalysis in The Foundations of Psychoanalysis as though they were \"already proven and widely accepted\" and for presenting a \"deeply personal\" attack on Freud as though it were scholarly criticism. He noted that while Crews made criticisms of psychoanalysis similar to those already made by Gr\u00fcnbaum, he took them to extremes. He also accused Crews of having a \"bizarre view\" of \"how scientists operate\". The literature scholar Ritchie Robertson described The Memory Wars as representing \"the more polemical version of anti-Freudian criticism\". The psychologist Michael Billig described Crews as one of the most notable critics of Freud to have suggested that the memories reported by Freud's patients were suggested by Freud himself. He criticized Crews's view that repression must be understood as a completely unconscious process."]}, {"page": "Freud: The Mind of the Moralist", "response": ["Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn and the sociologist Neil Smelser both considered Freud: The Mind of the Moralist brilliant, while M. D. Aeschliman and Stephen L. Gardner both described it as a \"great book\". The critic Frederick Crews called Freud: The Mind of the Moralist the most helpful book about Freud for \"placing psychoanalysis in the context of the intellectual and scientific history and the ethical assumptions from which it emerged\". The historian Paul Robinson argued that Freud: The Mind of the Moralist shows that Rieff was the most \"erudite and forceful\" right-wing author to portray Freud as a thinker whose theories had conservative implications. The philosopher John Forrester considered the book a \"classic work\" and the indispensable guide to the way in which Freud viewed his work as \"embodying essential elements of the cultural traditions to which he was self-consciously heir\". Gary Alan Fine and Philip Manning considered it part of a body of work with ongoing relevance to contemporary social theory, and Howard L. Kaye believed it showed why Freud was culturally central, and Rieff an essential social theorist. Lasch-Quinn called the book an \"intellectual biography of uncommon suppleness, and a genuine literary achievement\". She considered Rieff's expression \"psychological man\" a memorable term for a new human type who is forever \"anxious and insecure\" and has an unprecedented obsession with self. Kaye argued that the decline of Freud's reputation since the publication of Freud: The Mind of the Moralist does not diminish its value."]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John Forrester, 66, historian and philosopher of science."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2015", "response": ["*John Forrester, 66, British historian and philosopher of science, cancer.Professor John Forrester: Philosopher and historian widely celebrated for his work on Sigmund Freud and much-loved as an inspiring teacher"]}]}}
