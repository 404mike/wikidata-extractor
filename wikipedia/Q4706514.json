He managed Bristol City for thirteen years and managed clubs in four countries on three continents.\nBorn in London, he signed for Chelsea at the age of 17, though his playing time in the first team was limited to 35 matches in six years, during this time he completed his two years national service with the RAF and so only played one game in Chelsea's 1954\u201355 championship season. In 1958 he moved to Southend United, and in 1962 joined Coventry City as assistant manager/coach under Jimmy Hill.\nIn 1967 Hill recommended him for the vacant manager's job at Bristol City. He held it for thirteen years. In that time he consolidated City's position in the Second Division, and eventually, in 1976, led them to promotion to the First Division \u2013 then English football's top flight. During his spell as manager the club also made the semi-finals of the 1971 League Cup and won the 1978 Anglo-Scottish Cup. Dicks remained as manager throughout City's four-year stay in Division 1, but relegation at the end of the 1979-80 season and a poor start to the following season saw him leave on 8 September 1980. 20 months later City were in the 4th Division.\nDicks also managed Ethnikos Piraeus in Greece, Apollon Limassol in Cyprus and in Qatar (where he won the championship with Al-Rayyan Sports Club).\nHe managed Fulham for one season in 1990\u201391 having been initially recruited to help manager Ray Lewington. It was his first job back in English football for over a decade. The team's performance was poor. They finished 21st in the league (a position which normally would have seen them relegated to Division Four, though they were saved from this fate thanks to league restructuring) and were eliminated from the FA Cup by non-league side Hayes. Things appeared to be going better in the following season, but a run of five successive defeats near the end of 1991 saw him sacked.\n\nAfter leaving Fulham he moved to the United States and subsequently became head coach of Carolina Dynamo and then Charleston Battery in the A-League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol City F.C.", "response": ["In 1967, Alan Dicks was appointed manager, and things gradually began to improve, with promotion to the First Division in 1976, ending a 65-year exile from the top flight.", "| Alan Dicks"]}, {"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["|| Alan Dicks"]}, {"page": "Charleston Battery", "response": ["In 1999 the Battery moved into what is now known as MUSC Health Stadium, becoming the first non-Major League football professional club in the United States to build its own stadium, and forged a reputation as one of the country's most well-established lower division clubs. The Battery hired veteran English coach Alan Dicks and signed many experienced domestic players such as Paul Conway, Dan Calichman and Eric Wynalda while also bringing in notable foreign signings such as Terry Phelan and Ra\u00fal D\u00edaz Arce. In 2001 Dicks was replaced by fellow Englishman Chris Ramsey, who led Charleston to the A-League championship in 2003 with a 3\u20130 victory in the final over Minnesota Thunder in Charleston. Following Ramsey's departure in 2004, the club promoted longtime player and assistant coach Mike Anhaeuser to be the club's new manager.", "* Alan Dicks (1999\u20132001)"]}, {"page": "Peter Cormack", "response": ["Aged 30, in November 1976 Cormack left Liverpool and joined Alan Dicks's Bristol City for \u00a350,000. City were in their first season back in the top tier. City were in a three way dogfight to stay up. In City's penultimate game they played Liverpool, who already had the title wrapped up. Cormack was an unused substitute as his team won 2\u20131. Their final game opponents were Coventry City, who were also fighting to stay up. The kick-off had been delayed due to the large crowd, with some reports alleging it was intentionally delayed by Coventry's chairman, Jimmy Hill. Cormack joined the fray as a half-time substitute when his team were a goal down. Sunderland lost away to Everton, meaning a draw between to the two teams playing at Highfield Road would keep both those sides up and relegate Sunderland. News of Sunderland's defeat was displayed on the Highfield Road scoreboard. The score in the Coventry v Bristol City game was 2\u20132 at the time. Both teams then tamely played out a mutually beneficial draw."]}, {"page": "Ray Lewington", "response": ["The next two seasons showed no sign of an up-turn in fortune, but in 1989, Lewington guided the club to the play-offs, although they were unsuccessful in achieving promotion.
