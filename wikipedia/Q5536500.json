The term, Marvellous Melbourne, shifted meaning in the late 19th century, turning satirical and contradicting the \"booming\" it once was. An economic depression would wear thin on the city and the term would be used as a sarcastic insult to the English class system that left many Melbournians unemployed and impoverished.
