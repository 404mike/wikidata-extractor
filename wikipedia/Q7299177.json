(2002) \"\" Wallon noted that by the age of about six months, human infants and chimpanzees both seem to recognize their reflection in a mirror. While chimpanzees rapidly lose interest in the discovery, human infants typically become very interested and devote much time and effort to exploring the connections between their bodies and their images.Evans, Dylan (2005). \"From Lacan to Darwin ,\" in The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative, eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson,  Evanston: Northwestern University Press, pp38-55. In a 1931 paper, Wallon argued that mirrors helped children develop a sense of self-identity. However, later mirror test research indicates that while toddlers are usually fascinated by mirrors, they do not actually recognize themselves in mirrors until the age of 15 months at the earliest,Michael Lewis, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, and John Jaskir. \"Individual Differences in Visual Self-recognition as a Function of Mother-infant Attachment Relationship.\" Developmental Psychobiology 21.6 (1985) 1181-87 leading psychoanalytically trained critic Norman N.
