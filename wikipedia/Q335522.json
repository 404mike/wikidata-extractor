Lyons's temerity, ambition, and charisma, for which his white-blonde hair and pale complexion became a byword, made him popular with the High Commands of the Royal Navy and British Army and with the British aristocracy, with whom he maintained secret private correspondences to which his naval immediate superiors were not privy. His friendship with Fitzroy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, facilitated the integration of deployments that ensured allied victory in the Crimean War.\nEdmund Lyons was the father of the diplomat Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, the British Ambassador to the USA who solved the Trent Affair, and later British Ambassador to France. Edmund's eldest brother was Vice-Admiral John Lyons (1787\u20131872), who was on board HMS Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar and who served as British Ambassador in Egypt, and his nephews included Sir Algernon McLennan Lyons, Admiral of the Fleet (1833\u20131908).", "link_mentions": {}}}
