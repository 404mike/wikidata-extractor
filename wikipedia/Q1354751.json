He worked in a number of Sub-Saharan African countries as well as in the East End of London. Before his retirement in 2005, he worked in City Hospital, Birmingham and Winson Green Prison in inner-city Birmingham, England.\nDaniels is a contributing editor to City Journal, published by the Manhattan Institute, where he is the Dietrich Weismann Fellow. In addition to City Journal, his work has appeared in The British Medical Journal, The Times, The Observer, The Daily Telegraph, The Spectator, The Salisbury Review, National Review, New English Review, The Wall Street Journal, and Axess magasin. He is the author of a number of books, including Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass; Our Culture, What's Left of It; and Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality.\nIn his writing, Daniels frequently argues that the socially liberal and progressive views prevalent within Western intellectual circles minimise the responsibility of individuals for their own actions and undermine traditional mores, contributing to the formation within prosperous countries of an underclass afflicted by endemic violence, criminality, sexually transmitted diseases, welfare dependency, and drug abuse. Much of Dalrymple's writing is based on his experience of working with criminals and the mentally ill.\nIn 2011, Dalrymple was awarded the Prize for Liberty by the Flemish classical-liberal think tank Libera!.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henrik Ibsen", "response": ["* \"Ibsen and His Discontents\" \u2013 a critical, conservative view of Ibsen's works, written by Theodore Dalrymple"]}, {"page": "J.

Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal wrote to organisers of a Swedish book fair to which Singer was invited that \"A professor of morals ... who justifies the right to kill handicapped newborns ... is in my opinion unacceptable for representation at your level.\" Marc Maurer, president of the National Federation of the Blind, criticised Singer's appointment to the Princeton faculty in a banquet speech at the organisation's national convention in July 2001, claiming that Singer's support for euthanising disabled babies could lead to disabled older children and adults being valued less as well. Conservative psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple wrote in 2010 that Singerian moral universalism is \"preposterous\u2014psychologically, theoretically, and practically\"."]}, {"page": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales, which she so passionately desired, something which would always be denied her. His was the final rejection; the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval. Her peak popularity rate in the United Kingdom between 1981 and 2012 was 47%. In Theodore Dalrymple's opinion, her popularity stemmed from \"both her extreme difference from common people and her similarity to them\". He believed that by going public about her marital issues and bulimia she won the admiration of \"all those who have been unhappy in their marriages\" as well as people who suffered from psychological problems. Highly regarded by the LGBT community due to her work with gay men suffering from AIDS, Diana is considered to be a gay icon.", "In an article written for The Independent in 1998, journalist Yvonne Roberts observed the sudden change in people's opinion of Diana after her death from critical to complimentary, a viewpoint supported by Theodore Dalrymple who also noticed the \"sudden shift from cruel personal abuse to absurdly exaggerated respect\". Roberts also questioned whether she had achieved anything different from other members of the royal family and added that Diana was neither \"a saint\" nor \"a revolutionary\" figure, but \"may have encouraged some people\" to tackle issues such as landmines, AIDS and leprosy. While analysing the impact of Diana's death and her extraordinary popularity from a gendered point of view, British historian Ludmilla Jordanova said: \"To be an ideal, to be living for and on behalf of others is a terrible burden; it makes impossible, irreconcilable emotional demands \u2013 no human being can survive the complex forces that impact upon charismatic women.\" Jordanova also observed that \"Diana herself was not anti-establishment\" and that is \"Better to remember her by trying to decipher how emotions overshadow analysis and why women are the safeguards of humanitarian feelings.\" Author Anne Applebaum believed that Diana has not had any impact on public opinions posthumously; an idea supported by Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian who also wrote in his article that Diana's memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death, while Peter Conrad, another Guardian contributor, argued that even in \"a decade after her death, she is still not silent\", and Allan Massie of The Telegraph described Diana as \"the celebrity of celebrities\" whose sentiments \"continue to shape our society\". Writing for The Guardian, Monica Ali described Diana as \"a one-off, fascinating and flawed. Her legacy might be mixed, but it's not insubstantial. Her life was brief, but she left her mark\"."]}, {"page": "Sylvia Plath", "response": ["Plath's fellow confessional poet and friend Anne Sexton commented: \"Sylvia and I would talk at length about our first suicide, in detail and in depth\u2014between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the opposite of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, sucking on it.

Kinsey justified this sexual experimentation as being necessary to gain the confidence of his research subjects. He encouraged his staff to do likewise, and to engage in a wide range of sexual activity, to the extent that they felt comfortable; he argued that this would help his interviewers understand the participants' responses. Kinsey filmed sexual acts which included co-workers in the attic of his home as part of his research; Biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy explains that this was done to ensure the films' secrecy, which would have caused a scandal had it become public knowledge. James H. Jones, author of Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life, and British psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple, among others, have speculated that Kinsey was driven by his own sexual needs."]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand", "response": ["The UDSR joined the Republican Front, a centre-left coalition, which won the 1956 legislative election. As Justice Minister (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in Guy Mollet's cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President Ren\u00e9 Coty to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of Theodore Dalrymple) to accuse Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when this was popular with the French people."]}, {"page": "Vernon God Little", "response": ["Theodore Dalrymple wrote that the novel \"was a work of unutterably tedious nastiness and vulgarity\" that \"manifested itself even in its first sentence, and grew worse as the first paragraph progressed\"; Dalrymple described the author as \"a man with no discernible literary talent whose vulgarity of mind was deep and thoroughgoing\".
