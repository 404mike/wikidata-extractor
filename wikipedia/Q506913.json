The Finnish symphonist Leevi Madetoja was a pupil of Sibelius (for more on their relationship, see Relationship with Sibelius). In Britain, Vaughan Williams and Arnold Bax both dedicated their fifth symphonies to Sibelius. Furthermore, Tapiola is prominently echoed in both Bax's Sixth Symphony and Moeran's Symphony in G Minor. The influence of Sibelius's compositional procedures is also strongly felt in the First Symphony of William Walton. When these and several other major British symphonic essays were being written in and around the 1930s, Sibelius's music was very much in vogue, with conductors like Beecham and Barbirolli championing its cause both in the concert hall and on record. Walton's composer friend Constant Lambert even asserted that Sibelius was \"the first great composer since Beethoven whose mind thinks naturally in terms of symphonic form\". Earlier, Granville Bantock had championed Sibelius (the esteem was mutual: Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to the English composer, and in 1946 he became the first President of the Bantock Society). More recently, Sibelius was also one of the composers championed by Robert Simpson. Malcolm Arnold acknowledged his influence, and Arthur Butterworth also saw Sibelius's music as a source of inspiration in his work."]}, {"page": "1923 in music", "response": ["*August 4 \u2013 Arthur Butterworth, English composer (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "British brass band", "response": ["* Arthur Butterworth: Three Impressions for Brass, Odin"]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Arthur Butterworth || 1923 ||2014  || English ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Romance (music)", "response": ["* Arthur Butterworth: Romanza for horn and string quartet with double bass ad libitum (or piano), Op. 12 (1951)"]}, {"page": "Huddersfield Singers", "response": ["The Huddersfield Singers is renowned for its adventurous and interesting repertoire,See the Press clippings page on the choir's official site for cited examples substantiating this claim. and takes pride in performing works by less well-known composers alongside more mainstream pieces.
