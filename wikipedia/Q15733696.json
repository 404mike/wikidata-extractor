The Development Squad played its home matches at the club's training ground at Jersey Road, Osterley and a limited number of fixtures were played at Griffin Park. The team was made up of U21 players and was allowed to field three overage outfield players and one overage goalkeeper, which enabled first team fringe players to get game time. Scholars were also eligible to play for the Development Squad. After impressing during the 2011\u201312 pre-season, Jake Reeves became the first Development Squad player to be promoted into the first team squad. Charlie Adams, Josh Clarke and Mark Smith also graduated from the team. Josh Clarke made the most competitive appearances for the team during its existence (64) and Jan Holldack, Luke Norris and Jermaine Udumaga tied as top scorers with 14 goals each. The Development Squad model was abandoned in May 2016. Speaking about the shortcomings of Professional Development League football, then-academy conditioning coach James Purdue stated in October 2020 that \"one of the big things for us was that, physically, the players weren\u2019t challenged enough to put them in a place where they were ready to step into first team football.
