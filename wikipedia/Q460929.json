In a 'golden' sixteen-month period between 2010 and 2011, Greene dominated the event at international level, winning the World, European, Diamond League and Commonwealth titles in quick succession, in addition to winning the event as part of both the European Team Championships and the IAAF Continental Cup. Hindered by a knee injury, Greene finished in 4th at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and the same injury prevented him from being competitive at global level thereafter.\nHe is the second fastest British man over the 400 m hurdles, behind the British record holder, Kriss Akabusi.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Dai Greene (born 1986)"]}, {"page": "Llanelli", "response": ["*Dai Greene (born 1986), 400m hurdler, world champion and IAAF gold medalist"]}, {"page": "List of people with epilepsy", "response": ["| Dai Greene"]}, {"page": "2009 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|valign=top|Conrad WilliamsMichael BinghamRobert TobinMartyn RooneyDai Greene*|| 3:00.53SB  "]}, {"page": "Wales at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["*4 \u00d7 400 m relay: Gareth Warburton, Matt Elias, Rhys Williams, Dai Greene, Christian Malcolm"]}, {"page": "1986 in Wales", "response": ["*11 April \u2013 Dai Greene, athlete"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2006 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["400 m Hurdles: David Hughes, Dai Greene, Rhys Williams, Ryan Dinham"]}, {"page": "Rhys Williams (hurdler)", "response": ["On 31 July 2010, he achieved the Silver Medal in the 400 m hurdles at the European Athletics Championships in Barcelona, with fellow Welshman Dai Greene winning Gold."]}, {"page": "Periklis Iakovakis", "response": ["In 2010 he set a season target of defending his European title. He suffered a minor injury to his soleus muscle in March, but recovered and began his preparation in South Africa and Cyprus. He identified Dai Greene (the eventual winner) as his main European rival in the event. Finally he did not succeed in his goal, as he finished in the fifth place in the 2010 European final, having run in the tight first lane. He was slower in the 2011 season and, for the first time since 1998, his fastest run that year was over 50 seconds. He missed a seventh consecutive appearance at the World Championships, but did compete for Greece in the First League of the 2011 European Team Championships, where he won the 400\u00a0m hurdles race.
