The then Falkirk manager John Hughes said that some \"other clubs\" from Scotland as well as from abroad were also interested in his signature. He scored on his debut in a Scottish League Challenge Cup against Ayr. In the following month, he would start his scoring with a brace against Montrose, finding the net in the 15th and 31st minute of a 4\u20131 victory. This would mark a start of nine goals in seven matches, and come the end of the season, Duffy would score a total of 27 goals in 44 appearances. His goal against St Johnstone would help Falkirk move to third place in the league table and Falkirk would end the season as the champions of the Scottish First Division, thus winning promotion to Scottish Premier League. He also went on to bag the Young Player of the Year award, along with the Young Player of August award. At the start of the new season, he was linked with a move away from the club, even though manager Hughes was optimistic of keeping him. In an interview to the club's website, he said \"I've spoken to Darryl and he is fully committed to Falkirk FC.\" Duffy's first goal in the Premier League would come against Livingston. In the 2\u20130 victory, his 72nd minute shot would find the net, due to a deflection off Greg Strong. He would play a total of 16 matches, scoring nine goals in the top tier of the Scottish League until his transfer to Hull City."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Welsh Premier League", "response": ["| Greg Strong"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Welsh Premier League", "response": ["| Greg Strong"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Greg Strong"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Greg Strong"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Greg Strong ||  Blackpool || 21 November 1997 || 10 February 1998", "| Greg Strong"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Greg Strong"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["| Greg Strong", "| Greg Strong", "||DF||||6 ||Greg Strong||2||0||0||2", "|6 ||||DF||Greg Strong||5||0||0||0||0||0||5||0"]}, {"page": "Steven Lecefel", "response": ["In 2011, Lecefel left Paris for Barnet in London, who play in the English League Two, but he only stayed a few months after Lawrie Sanchez decided not to sign him.
