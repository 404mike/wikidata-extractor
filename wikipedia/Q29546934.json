Witnesses  stated that at the scene of the murder, the only man present with a Webley revolver was Lieutenant Oswald Rayner, a British officer attached to the SIS station in Petrograd, who had visited the Yusupov palace several times on the day of the murder. This account is further supported by an audience between the British Ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, who knew about an assassination attempt before it happened,Buchanan, p. 48. and the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, when Nicholas stated that he suspected \"a young Englishman who had been a college friend of Prince Felix Yusupoff, of having been concerned in Rasputin's murder ...\".Buchanan, p. 51. The second SIS officer in Petrograd at the time was Captain Stephen Alley, born in a Yusupov Palace near Moscow in 1876, where his father was one of the prince's tutors.

Several other books and documentaries have claimed Scale's involvement in Rasputin's death, or even alleged that Scale commanded Rayner to fatally shoot him.
