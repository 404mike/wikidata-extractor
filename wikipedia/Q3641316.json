It looked like being an exciting season as Gilera was again at full strength with riders like Geoff Duke, Libero Liberati and Bob McIntyre, while MV Agusta fielded Surtees and Terry Shepherd (Umberto Masetti also raced at Monza). In Germany, Surtees dropped out, while Shepherd only finished fifth. Surtees made a mistake with the Senior TT. He did not trust the weather and decided to drive without the crosswind sensitive dustbin fairing. McIntyre gambled on good weather and did use the streamliner. That worked: he became the first driver in history to average the magical \"ton\" (100 miles per hour) on the circuit and finished two minutes ahead of Surtees.The Guardian page 1 & 8 MCINTYRE DOES 101.12 mph Average of 98.99 in senior TT Saturday 8 June 1957 \"From a Special Correspondent.
