Born in Farnworth, Lancashire, he played as a wing half for Huddersfield Town, Lancaster Town, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Watford, Crewe Alexandra and Rochdale. He was appointed player-manager at Rochdale in 1938, and continued in that capacity during the Second World War until appointed team manager of Birmingham in August 1943. His contract included provision for a two-year appointment after the war, but after two months in post, he requested and obtained his release for domestic reasons, after which he rejoined Rochdale as secretary-manager. He went on to manage Wigan Athletic and Oldham Athletic. He died in his native Farnworth at the age of 65.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wigan Athletic F.C.", "response": ["| Ted Goodier"]}]}}
