In the final he shave three thousands of that record, taking the Paralympic title and pushing Graeme Ballard (Great Britain) and Roman Pavlyk (Ukraine) into silver and bronze positions. There were no qualifier rounds for the 400m T36 event and Shvetcov's results leading into the Games were strong enough to see him in the final. The podium finish of the 400m saw another Britain take silver, Paul Blake and Pavlyk again take bronze, while Shetcov's final time of 53.31s set a new world record giving him the gold medal. For Shetcov's third event of the Paralympic Games, the 800m, he arrived as one of the title favourites, having set a new world record a few months earlier when he ran 2:05.05 at the 2012 European Championships in Stadskanaal.
