During the summer of 2002, Fastlane self-released their debut EP \u2018She Loves the Rock\u2019 and was picked up by 20 Deck Records, where they were soon on the road touring and playing to audiences across the country.   Another line-up change and an original member return, Ian Maynard picked up the bass as Tom left the band.  Fastlane grew as they gained over 20,000 downloads on the former website MP3.com in under 12 months.   2003 found Fastlane making the final line-up change, when Gary Tough joined as the drummer.  In reviews, Fastlane's genre has been listed as pop punk, emo, screamo, pop, and metal.In March 2004, Fastlane entered the studio to record their first full-length album titled New Start with the producer Iain Wetherell, at the Premier Studios in Corby.  They played shows in multiple cities in England promoting their upcoming release, and in the latter part of 2004, the album was finished. New Start included the songs, \"Eyes Closed\", \"Elevator\", \"A New Start\", \"Million Times\" and the single \"Dreaming\".
