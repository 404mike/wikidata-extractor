When he reached the World No. 2 ranking behind Jansher in November 1994, many observers felt he seemed a strong candidate to displace the aging Pakistani champion as World No. 1. However, in 1995, Marshall was afflicted with glandular fever, the effects of which meant he was unable to play top-level squash for two years.Marshall returned to the professional tour in 1997, re-claiming his place in the England squad which went on to win the World Team Squash Championships title in Malaysia. He broke back into the world's top-10 in 1999, and won his third British National Championship title in February 2000. He was protecting a remarkable record, having been unbeaten in that event since December 1989.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pakistan International", "response": ["| 1999 || Peter Marshall || Amjad Khan || 8\u201315, 15\u201313, 15\u201312, 15\u201310", "| 1994 || Jansher Khan || Peter Marshall || 14\u201315, 15\u201314, 15\u201310, 9\u201315, 15\u20136"]}, {"page": "World Squash Championships", "response": ["|  Peter Marshall Chris Walker", "|  Peter Marshall", "|  Alex Gough Peter Marshall"]}, {"page": "Peter Marshall", "response": ["Peter Marshall may refer to:", "* Peter Marshall (entertainer) (born 1926), American game show host of The Hollywood Squares, 1966\u20131981", "* Peter Marshall (author, born 1939) (1939\u20131972), British novelist whose works include The Raging Moon and Excluded from the Cemetery", "* Peter Marshall (author) (born 1946), British travel writer whose works include Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism and Europe's Lost Civilization", "* Peter Marshall (UK broadcaster) (born 1945), British game show host of Sale of the Century in the 1980s", "* Peter Marshall (cricketer) (born 1963), New Zealand cricketer", "* Peter Marshall (footballer, born 1942), Australian footballer for Collingwood in the 1960s", "* Peter Marshall (footballer, born 1954), Australian footballer for Collingwood in the 1970s", "* Peter Marshall (squash player) (born 1971), English squash player", "* Peter Marshall (swimmer) (born 1982), American swimmer", "* Peter Marshall (Presbyterian minister) (1902\u20131949), Scottish-born American Presbyterian pastor, chaplain of the United States Senate", "* Peter Marshall (Anglican priest) (1940\u20132020), Anglican Dean of Worcester", "* Peter Marshall (journalist) (born 1952), British journalist and broadcaster BBC Newsnight", "* Peter Marshall (police officer) (born c. 1953), commissioner of New Zealand and the Solomon Islands police services", "* Peter Marshall (historian) (born 1964), history professor at Warwick University", "* Peter Marshall (diplomat), British diplomat and Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General (1983\u201388)"]}, {"page": "Jansher Khan", "response": ["|   bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 1994 || Barcelona, Spain ||    Peter Marshall   || 10\u201315, 15\u201311, 15\u20138, 15\u20134", "|  bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 1995 || Cardiff, Wales ||  Peter Marshall ||  15\u20134, 15\u20134, 15\u20135", "| bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 1994 || Pakistan ||  Peter Marshall ||  14-15, 15-14, 15-10, 9-15, 15-6", "| bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 1994 || Zurich, Switzerland||  Peter Marshall || 8-15, 15-8, 15-7, 15-9"]}, {"page": "British Open Squash Championships", "response": ["| 1995 ||  Jansher Khan ||  Peter Marshall || 15\u20134, 15\u20134, 15\u20135", "|  Peter Marshall || 0 || 1 || 1"]}, {"page": "British National Squash Championships", "response": ["| 1992 || Peter Marshall|| Bryan Beeson || 7-9, 9-4, 9-0, 9-0", "| 1994 || Peter Marshall|| Peter Nicol || 9-6, 9-7, 9-4", "| 2000 || Peter Marshall|| David Evans || 15\u20139, 15\u20136, 15\u201311"]}, {"page": "List of people with chronic fatigue syndrome", "response": ["|Peter Marshall"]}, {"page": "British Junior Open Squash", "response": ["| 1985 ||  Peter Marshall ||  Damian Walker ||  Del Harris", "| 1990 ||  Chris Tomlinson ||  Justin Rennie ||  Peter Marshall"]}, {"page": "Motor City Open (squash)", "response": ["| 1999 || Peter Marshall || David Palmer || 15\u201310, 15\u20137, 15\u201312"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Millfield", "response": ["*Peter Marshall, English professional squash player"]}, {"page": "PSA World Series", "response": ["| 1994 ||   Jansher Khan ||  Peter Marshall || 8\u201315, 15\u20138, 15\u20137, 15\u20139"]}, {"page": "European Junior Squash Championships", "response": ["| align=center| 1989 || Aix-en-Provence ||   || Peter Marshall"]}, {"page": "Grasshopper Cup", "response": ["| 1994 || Jansher Khan || Peter Marshall ||", "| 1992 || Chris Dittmar || Peter Marshall ||"]}, {"page": "1994 Men's World Open Squash Championship", "response": ["The 1994 PSA Men's Ballantines World Open Squash Championship is the men's edition of the 1994 World Open, which serves as the individual world championship for squash players.
