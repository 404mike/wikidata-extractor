Some criticized Parelli for handling the horse in a rough manner.  The Parellis later uploaded an interview where they address the abuse accusations.  In mid-2010 Pat Parelli was videoed working with a stallion using a gum-line and holding up the horse's front leg with a rope. According to Horse & Hound, this demonstration caused an online \"furore\" with many angry comments about abuse. Parelli asserted that the horse was a risk to his handlers and an extreme example of equine behavior. The British Showjumping Association stated that the horse was found to be fit and well,  and the owner of the horse, Robert Whitaker, said he felt the situation had been blown out of proportion."]}, {"page": "Robert Whitaker (rider)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Whitaker (equestrian)"]}, {"page": "2008 Global Champions Tour", "response": ["| align=center|3 ||  Robert Whitaker || Lacroix || align=center|4 || align=center|0 || align=center|78.83 || align=center| || align=center| || align=center|16"]}, {"page": "2011 FEI Nations Cup Promotional League", "response": ["| Robert Whitaker || Omelli || align=center|10 || align=center style=color:gray|8"]}, {"page": "November 2010 in sports", "response": ["***10th competition in Toronto (CSI 4*-W):  Brianne Goutal  on Ballade van het Indihoff  Harrie Smolders  on Regina Z  Robert Whitaker  on Omelli"]}, {"page": "2011 Falsterbo Horse Show", "response": ["| Robert Whitaker || USA Today || align=center|4 || align=center|4"]}, {"page": "September 2011 in sports", "response": ["**Nations Cup of Spain in Gij\u00f3n, Spain (CSIO 5*):   (Pilar Cord\u00f3n, Eduardo Alvarez Aznar, Jesus Garmendia, Julio Arias Cueva)   (Scott Brash, David McPherson, Bruce Menzies, Robert Whitaker)   (Malin Baryard-Johnsson, Helena Persson, Peder Fredricson, Svante Johansson)"]}, {"page": "2013 CSIO Gij\u00f3n", "response": ["| align=left|Robert Whitaker || align=left|Catwalk IV || 0 || 0"]}, {"page": "2011 CSIO Gij\u00f3n", "response": ["| Robert Whitaker || Omelli || align=center|10 || align=center style=color:gray|8"]}, {"page": "2009 CSIO Gij\u00f3n", "response": ["| 5 || align=left| Robert Whitaker || align=left|Draco || 4 || 0 || 56.80 || 4 || 7,750 \u20ac"]}, {"page": "2017 in equestrianism", "response": ["*** Individual winners:  J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guery (with horse Grand Cru van de Rozenberg),  Zuzana Zelinkova (with horse Caleri II),  Robert Whitaker (with horse Catwalk IV)"]}, {"page": "2006 CSIO Gij\u00f3n", "response": ["| Robert Whitaker || Nepos Van Limbo || align=center|0 || align=center|8"]}]}}
