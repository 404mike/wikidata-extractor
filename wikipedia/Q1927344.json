Edwardes quickly reversed the Ryder Report's policy of giving prominence to the \"Leyland\" brand, and returned focus back to the individual brands.  Leyland Cars was thus renamed BL Cars Ltd, consisting of two main divisions; Austin Morris (the volume car business) and Jaguar Rover Triumph (JRT) (the specialist or upmarket division). Austin Morris included MG. Land Rover and Range Rover were later separated from JRT to form the Land Rover Group. JRT later split up into Rover-Triumph and Jaguar Car Holdings (which included Daimler).  At the same time the public use of the \"British Leyland\" name ceased, being abbreviated simply to \"BL\", whilst the company's \"plughole\" logo was redesigned with the central \"L\" removed.  The Austin-Morris division was given its own unique brand identity with the introduction of the blue and green \"chevron\" logo, which was later expanded in use when the car manufacturing operations were further consolidated into the Austin Rover Group in the 1980s.", "By the end of Michael Edwardes tenure as chairman of BL plc in 1982, the company had been restructured into two distinct parts \u2013 the Cars Division (which consisted of Austin-Morris, Rover and Jaguar, and was led by Ray Horrocks) and the Commercial Vehicle Division (which consisted of Land Rover, Leyland Trucks, Leyland Buses and Freight Rover) \u2013 whose chief executive was David Andrews. The holding company BL plc was now chaired by Sir Austin Bide in a non-executive capacity. Around this time, the BL Cars Ltd division renamed itself Austin Rover Group, shortly before the launch of the Austin Maestro and Ray Horrocks was replaced by Harold Musgrove as its chairman and chief executive. The emergence of the Austin Rover brand effectively put an end to the separate Austin-Morris and Jaguar-Rover-Triumph divisions, since by this time, Jaguar now resided in a separate company called Jaguar Car Holdings and was now led by Sir John Egan, and this was later de-merged from BL completely and privatised in 1984. That same year, with both the Morris Ital and the Triumph Acclaim being discontinued, their respective brands were effectively shelved, leaving only the Austin and Rover marques, whilst Land Rover moved into the Freight Rover Group alongside the light trucks division.  After the divestment of Unipart and the van, truck and bus divisions in 1987 (see below), leaving just two subsidiaries \u2013 Austin Rover (volume cars) and Land Rover (SUVs) this essentially remained the basic structure of BL and subsequently the Rover Group until the 2000 break-up.", "* 1977 Michael Edwardes appointed as chairman by the third Wilson Government; begins massive cull of excess BL assets", "* 1982 Michael Edwardes steps down as chairman; BL Cars Ltd renamed Austin Rover Group (ARG)"]}, {"page": "Triumph Stag", "response": ["The Stag was never directly replaced. British Leyland planned an equivalent model to follow the Stag in the form of a derivative of the Triumph TR7 sports car which was codenamed the Lynx. The Lynx used the TR7 platform with an extra 12 inches in the wheelbase to accommodate a rear seat and had fastback coupe bodywork. Power came from a 3.5-litre Rover V8 and the gearbox and rear axle were lifted from the Rover SD1. The Lynx was very close to production being scheduled for launch in 1978.

After discovering Robinson's links with various communist groups, the company amassed sufficient evidence claiming that his actions were intended to deliberately damage both BL itself and the UK economy. As a result of this, he was dismissed in 1979. Secondly, Edwardes began a ruthless programme of factory closures and sell-offs. The biggest casualties of this were the MG assembly plant in Abingdon, and the Triumph plants in Speke (Liverpool) and Canley (Coventry). BL pulled out of entire markets \u2013 for example the large Leyland tractors range was sold-off wholesale to Marshall, and Jaguar was privatised in 1984.

Although the Acclaim officially replaced the Triumph Dolomite, BL's mainstream products in the segment were the Austin Allegro and Austin Maxi - both of which were badly dated and suffered a reputation for poor quality and reliability.  The Acclaim was therefore originally intended as a stopgap measure until the Maestro/Montego models were to be ready for production in 1983 and 1984 respectively. On 26 December 1979, Michael Edwardes officially signed a collaboration between the two companies. The new car went into production 18 months later, badged as the Triumph Acclaim and based on the Honda Ballade (which was not sold in Europe). It replaced the Triumph Dolomite, which had finished production a year earlier at the defunct Canley plant in Coventry. The Acclaim was officially launched by BL on 7 October 1981.

Although BL's advertising emphasised the car's connection with the Italian design house, Italdesign did not have a direct role in the styling of the new car, which had been handled in-house by Harris Mann. Italdesign had been involved in a consultancy role, to help design new tooling and assembly methods, and work out how to integrate the altered parts of the new car into the existing Marina production chain. That is why, despite bearing the studio's name, the Ital is absent from lists of styling jobs handled by the firm.

In 1975, British Leyland became bankrupt and was nationalised by the Government. In 1977, a new managing director, Michael Edwardes, was appointed.

During the Common Market referendum he advocated a 'No' vote but was not prominent in the campaign. Immediately afterwards Wilson swapped Varley's and Benn's posts, so that Varley was effectively promoted to Secretary of State for Industry. In November 1976 Varley suffered an embarrassing public defeat when he determined to shut down the loss-making Chrysler car factory: the Cabinet forced him to increase its subsidy to keep it open.

This resulted in the closure of the plant in May 1978, the move of production to Canley, Coventry, and, it is said, led to the cancellation of the TR7 Sprint. However, this industrial action is itself blamed, ultimately, on the \"replacement of the aristocratic Lord Stokes with South African businessman Michael Edwardes\" as managing director, announced in Nov 1977. These events therefore occur well after the main production ceased in early July 1977, and probably too late to be responsible for the change of status indicated by the start of the transfer of the press garage cars out of the keeping of Sales and Marketing, on 9 November 1977. Another reason given for the cancellation is that \"the Marketing department killed it because the 0-60 acceleration times were identical to the 2V engine with little increase in top speed.\" However, this lack of significant difference is disputed, and no reason is given for why any TR7 Sprints should have been produced if Sales and Marketing did not want it."]}, {"page": "Michael Edwardes (South African businessman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Edwardes"]}, {"page": "Rover (marque)", "response": ["As British Leyland struggled through financial turmoil and an industrial-relations crisis during the 1970s, it was effectively nationalised after a multibillion-pound government cash injection in 1975.
