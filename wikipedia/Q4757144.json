A theory relating the death to Renaissance notions of honour and symbolic wounding has been advanced by art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon. Whatever the details, it was a serious matter. Previously, his high-placed patrons had protected him from the consequences of his escapades, but this time they could do nothing. Caravaggio, outlawed, fled to Naples.", "Since the 1970s art scholars and historians have debated the inferences of homoeroticism in Caravaggio's works as a way to better understand the man. Caravaggio never married and had no known children, and Howard Hibbard observed the absence of erotic female figures in the artist's oeuvre: \"In his entire career he did not paint a single female nude\",Hibbard, p.97 and the cabinet-pieces from the Del Monte period are replete with \"full-lipped, languorous boys ... who seem to solicit the onlooker with their offers of fruit, wine, flowers\u2014and themselves\" suggesting an erotic interest in the male form.Louis Crompton, Homosexuality and Civilization (Harvard, 2006) p.288 The model of Amor vincit omnia, Cecco di Caravaggio, lived with the artist in Rome and stayed with him even after he was obliged to leave the city in 1606, and the two may have been lovers.Andrew Graham-Dixon, Caravaggio: A life sacred and profane, Penguin, 2011, p.4", "A connection with a certain Lena is mentioned in a 1605 court deposition by Pasqualone, where she is described as \"Michelangelo's girl\".Bertolotti, Artisti Lombardi. pp.71\u201372 According to G.B. Passeri, this 'Lena' was Caravaggio's model for the Madonna di Loreto; and according to Catherine Puglisi, 'Lena' may have been the same person as the courtesan Maddalena di Paolo Antognetti, who named Caravaggio as an \"intimate friend\" by her own testimony in 1604.Catheine Puglisi, \"Caravaggio\" Phaidon 1998, p.199Riccardo Bassani and Fiora Bellini, \"Caravaggio assassino\", 1994, pp.205\u2013214 Caravaggio was also rumored to be madly in love with Fillide Melandroni, a well known Roman prostitute who modeled for him in several important paintings.Andrew Graham-Dixon, Caravaggio: A life sacred and profane, Penguin, 2011", "Baglione's painting of \"Divine Love\" has also been seen as a visual accusation of sodomy against Caravaggio. Such accusations were damaging and dangerous as sodomy was a capital crime at the time. Even though the authorities were unlikely to investigate such a well-connected person as Caravaggio, \"Once an artist had been smeared as a pederast, his work was smeared too.\" Francesco Susino in his later biography additionally relates the story of how the artist was chased by a schoolmaster in Sicily for spending too long gazing at the boys in his care. Susino presents it as a misunderstanding, but some authors have speculated that Caravaggio may indeed have been seeking sex with the boys, using the incident to explain some of his paintings which they believe to be homoerotic.Andrew Graham-Dixon, Caravaggio: A life sacred and profane, Penguin, 2011, p.412", "The art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon has summarised the debate:", "There was a fussiness to the tone whenever a scholar or curator was forced to grapple with transgressive sexuality, and you can still find it even in relatively recent histories, including Andrew Graham-Dixon\u2019s 2010 biography of Caravaggio, which acknowledges only that \u201che likely slept with men.\u201d The author notes the artist\u2019s fluid sexual desires but gives some of Caravaggio\u2019s most explicitly homoerotic paintings tortured readings to keep them safely in the category of mere \u201cambiguity.\u201d", "* Andrew Graham-Dixon, Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane, London, Allen Lane, 2009.

Some writers have likened the illusion of Baroque royal theatre to the illusion of kingly power the performances were designed to reinforce.Robbins, p. 27-28.

This proposal was at the time rejected by the artists; but in 1777 Barry made an offer to paint the whole on condition that he was allowed the choice of his subjects, and that he would be paid by the society the costs of canvas, paints and models.

He finished the series of pictures after seven years to the satisfaction of the members of the society, who granted him two exhibitions, and at subsequent periods voted him 50 guineas, a gold medal, and a further 200 guineas.
