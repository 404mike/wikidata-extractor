He also made free transfer signings of defenders Rhys Bennett and George Taft; midfielder Kevan Hurst; and forwards CJ Hamilton, Ashley Hemmings, Patrick Hoban and Darius Henderson. Kyle Howkins and Alex Iacovitti also came in on loan. He was nominated for the EFL League Two Manager of the Month award after his team picked up ten points from their opening five fixtures in August. Mansfield fell away after this good start however and Murray was booed by supporters, though denied reports that he was considering quitting the club on 3 November, stating \"I'm not going anywhere for a long while.\" Murray resigned 11 days later, after a 4\u20130 defeat at Portsmouth left Mansfield 18th in the table."]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["In the January transfer window Aspin allowed two departures, plus Gavin Gunning left the club after rejecting a contract offer and centre-back Tom Anderson was recalled from his loan; incoming were non-league players Dior Angus, Luke Hannant and Callum Howe, as well as loanees Donovan Wilson, Zak Jules, Charlie Raglan and Kyle Howkins. Aspin remarked that the four centre-backs brought in did not cost the club much financially, and that he would have liked to have strengthened in other areas \"but for one reason or another it just hasn't happened\". However he managed to convert Cristian Monta\u00f1o from a winger to a left-back and Antony Kay from a centre-half to a central midfielder, and guided the club to safety with two games to spare. Vale ended the campaign in 20th-place \u2013 the joint-lowest finish in the club's history \u2013 with just one point above the relegation zone, having been out of the relegation zone on goal difference upon Aspin's arrival at the club."]}, {"page": "Charlie Raglan", "response": ["He ruptured two ligaments on the eve of the new season and was ruled out of action for three months. His injury left him unable to feature under manager Pep Clotet, and with the arrival of Robert Dickie caretaker-manager Derek Fazackerley felt that he had enough cover at centre-back to allow Raglan to look for game time elsewhere. On 30 January 2018, he re-joined former club Port Vale in League Two on loan until the end of the 2017\u201318 season; manager Neil Aspin had quickly needed a centre-back to replace the recalled loanee Tom Anderson. He made an excellent debut by helping the \"Valiants\" to keep a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw with Morecambe at Vale Park on 4 February. However he was dropped after a poor performance in a 5\u20131 defeat to Cheltenham Town six days later, before making a good impression upon his return to the team four weeks later in place of the injured Kyle Howkins."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 29 July 2016 || CB ||  || Kyle Howkins || Mansfield Town || 3 January 2017 || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|15||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kyle Howkins", "| 29 July 2016 || CB ||  || Kyle Howkins || West Bromwich Albion || 3 January 2017 || "]}, {"page": "Alex Iacovitti", "response": ["Stags manager Adam Murray revealed that there had been a lot of interest from other clubs in Iacovitti, and described the player as an \"old-school centre-half\". On 12 November, Iacovitti was shown a red card in the 74th minute away at Portsmouth. A goal down at the time, Mansfield Town went on to lose the game 4\u20130 having also had Kyle Howkins dismissed. On 1 January 2017, Mansfield Town confirmed that Iacovitti would be returning to Forest early from his loan spell. Mansfield manager Steve Evans, who had replaced Murray in November, cited the reason as a lack of playing time."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale opened the New Year with a 1\u20130 defeat at second-placed Notts County, and though Aspin was pleased with his players he was highly critical of the referee for his award of a late penalty, calling it \"a really bad decision\". Earlier in the day he made his second signing as manager, bringing in striker Dior Angus from non-league Redditch United. Meanwhile, Gavin Gunning left the club on the expiry of his contract, whilst Jack Stobbs, Rekeil Pyke and Tyler Denton returned to their parent clubs. In contrast, Whitfield's loan was extended until the end of the season. Gunning made his debut for Forest Green on 6 January, and kept a clean sheet as Rovers beat the Vale 1\u20130 with a goal from fellow d\u00e9butante Reuben Reid; Aspin apologized to supporters after the match for the team's performance. Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016. He also boosted the defensive numbers by bringing in centre-back Zak Jules on loan from Shrewsbury Town. Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall. A surprise departure was then announced, as Anderson was recalled early from his loan spell by Burnley. Aspin responded quickly by signing former youth-team centre-back Charlie Raglan on loan from Oxford United, 21-year old defender Kyle Howkins on loan from West Bromwich Albion and 23-year old defender Callum Howe for an undisclosed fee from Lincoln City.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||33||align=\"left\"| Kyle Howkins", "|33||||DF||Kyle Howkins||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0", "| 31 January 2018 || CB ||  || Kyle Howkins || West Bromwich Albion || 30 June 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 12 August 2017 || CB ||  || Kyle Howkins || Cambridge United || 12 February 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|12 August 2017 || CB ||  ||Kyle Howkins ||West Bromwich Albion  ||2 January 2018  || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale travelled to league leaders Lincoln City on New Year's Day and looked to be leaving with a 1\u20130 defeat despite a very credible performance, before Oyeleke scored a spectacular stoppage-time equaliser to secure a point; after the game Aspin threatened to quit the club after feeling that supporters had shown him a \"lack of respect\". After taking time to consider his position he said that he would remain as manager as he had the support of the players and the chairman. On 12 January, Vale fell to a 3\u20130 home defeat to Colchester, losing Pope to a hamstring injury in the process and Aspin bemoaned his side's poor run of luck. Two days later he signed versatile defender Adam Crookes on loan from Nottingham Forest, who had previously been recalled from a loan at Lincoln City after failing to break into the first-team there. Another new arrival was 23-year-old striker Danny Elliott, who was signed following a trial; he had previously been playing in the Spanish Tercera Divisi\u00f3n for San Cristoba. With Pope ruled out of action for over a month with a hamstring injury, Miller was restored to the starting eleven at Crawley on 19 January and scored the only goal of the game to maintain the club's five-point gap above the relegation zone. Aspin went on to bring in 20-year-old Wales youth international forward Mark Harris on loan from Cardiff City. However he was again facing questions over his own future following a 1\u20130 home defeat to promotion-chasing Carlisle United; Vale had actually looked good for a point until conceding a deflected goal on 79 minutes despite having Miller sent off for a reckless challenge just before half-time. They closed out the month with a 0\u20130 draw at Newport County, though ended a third consecutive game with only ten men as Gibbons was given a straight red card with five minutes left to play. Aspin tendered his resignation the following day, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we [he and assistant Lee Nogan] did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch\". Despite having no manager, the club completed the loan signing of West Bromwich Albion defender Kyle Howkins, who had joined the club on loan at the same point of the 2017\u201318 season.
