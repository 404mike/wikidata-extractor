One of the concerns of the age was to find a suitable style for the discussion of scientific topics, which needed above all a clear exposition of facts and arguments, rather than the ornate style favored at the time. Bacon in his The Advancement of Learning criticized those who are preoccupied with style rather than \"the weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, or depth of judgment\". On matters of style, he proposed that the style conform to the subject matter and to the audience, that simple words be employed whenever possible, and that the style should be agreeable.See Lisa Jardine, Francis Bacon: Discovery and the Art of Discourse (Cambridge University Press, 1975).", "* Lisa Jardine, Francis Bacon: Discovery and the Art of Discourse (Cambridge University Press, 1975)"]}, {"page": "Christiaan Huygens", "response": ["Part of the incentive for inventing the pendulum clock was to create an accurate marine chronometer that could be used to find longitude by celestial navigation during sea voyages. However, the clock proved unsuccessful as a marine timekeeper because the rocking motion of the ship disturbed the motion of the pendulum. In 1660, Lodewijk Huygens made a trial on a voyage to Spain, and reported that heavy weather made the clock useless. Alexander Bruce elbowed into the field in 1662, and Huygens called in Sir Robert Moray and the Royal Society to mediate and preserve some of his rights. Trials continued into the 1660s, the best news coming from a Royal Navy captain Robert Holmes operating against the Dutch possessions in 1664. Lisa Jardine doubts that Holmes reported the results of the trial accurately, and Samuel Pepys expressed his doubts at the time: The said master [i.e. the captain of Holmes' ship] affirmed, that the vulgar reckoning proved as near as that of the watches, which [the clocks], added he, had varied from one another unequally, sometimes backward, sometimes forward, to 4, 6, 7, 3, 5 minutes; as also that they had been corrected by the usual account.

The letters and Motion's biography fuelled further assessments of this kind, such as Lisa Jardine's comment in The Guardian that \"The Britishness of Larkin's poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the Selected Letters now make explicit\". On the other hand, the revelations were dismissed by the novelist Martin Amis in The War Against Clich\u00e9, arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient.
