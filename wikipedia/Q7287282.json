He spent that time largely in exile from his see, which he perhaps never visited. He did find a position there for Seth Ward. He was both a Royalist in politics, and a Calvinist in religion, an unusual combination of the period. Brownrigg opposed Laudianism in Cambridge during the 1630s and at the Short Parliament Convocation of 1640. Nominated to the Westminster Assembly, he apparently took no part in it.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Temple Church", "response": ["* 1658\u20131659\u2020 Ralph Brownrigg (as Bishop of Exeter)"]}]}}
