The opportunity would come in 1980, when Bators was invited to London to join British punk band Sham 69, who had recently parted ways with their singer Jimmy Pursey. Bators had met the band in Los Angeles a few months before, and they had gotten on well together. James: \"That was really the ticket to get Stiv over to London, so we could work.

They experimented with different rhythm sections, rehearsing with bassists Tony James and Glen Matlock, and drummers Terry Chimes and Steve Nicol. James: \"Musically it sounded alright, but ... personality wise it just wasn't kind of fitting.
