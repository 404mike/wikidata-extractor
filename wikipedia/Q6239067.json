Starting in late 1982, a number of IRA and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) men were shot dead by the RUC. This led to accusations of a shoot-to-kill policy by the RUC. In September 1983, four officers were charged with murder in connection with the deaths.

It is claimed by critics that the Walker Report cemented the position of RUC Special Branch as a force within a force, beyond normal checks and balances; established a policy of primacy of intelligence requirements over criminal investigation; led to a perception of informants as an untouchable \"protected species\"; and to an acceptance of cover-up and fabrication of evidence, such as that revealed after the so-called \"shoot-to-kill\" killings by police in 1982, that formed the subject of the Stalker inquiry.Policing the Police, Insight, Ulster TV, 1 May 2001; transcript via Relatives for JusticeRichard Norton-Taylor and Nick Hopkins, Security service told RUC that it could put spying on terrorists ahead of solving crime, The Guardian, 14 June 2001Ian Cobain, Northern Ireland: when Britain fought terror with terror, The Guardian, 9 July 2015Alan Simpson, How Special Branch betrayed the police, The Belfast Telegraph, 5 July 2016Ian Cobain and Owen Bowcott, RUC told to put intelligence before arrests, reveals secret MI5 report, The Guardian, 26 June 2018 The implementing memo became known in 2001; the underlying report itself was declassified in June 2018."]}, {"page": "Ulster Workers' Council", "response": ["In 1977 a new body, the United Unionist Action Council (UUAC), was established bringing together representatives of the UDA, Down Orange Welfare, the Orange Volunteers and the remnants of the UWC under the chairmanship of Joseph Burns and with the support of Paisley and Baird, who was leading his own United Ulster Unionist Party by this point.
