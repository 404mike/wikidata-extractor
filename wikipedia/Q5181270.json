He is currently the goalkeeping coach of the club.\nNelson began his career with Partick Thistle before moving to Ireland to join Cork City in January 1991. He returned to Scotland four months later and went on to make 90 league appearances for Thistle before moving to Heart of Midlothian. He stayed at Tynecastle for two seasons (making 24 league appearances) but left to sign for Falkirk.\nHe remained there for a further two season before moving on to Ayr United where he became a stalwart in the Somerset Park side, making 150 appearances in his five seasons there. This included playing in the Scottish League Cup 2002 final, which Ayr lost to Rangers 4\u20130. In 2003, he joined St Johnstone on a free transfer and made 8 appearances before moving to Brechin City on loan in 2004.
