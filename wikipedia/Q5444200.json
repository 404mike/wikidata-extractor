He is a Vehicle Design graduate of the British Royal College of Art, London. In 1975, he joined Rootes, which was Chrysler UK from 1971 to 1978, in Coventry, later working at Chrysler in the United States (Highland Park, 1976), followed by Simca (Carrieres Sous Poissy, 1979), and Citro\u00ebn (Velizy, 1981). In 1983, he moved to Jaguar, and under Geoff Lawson, he became Senior Design Manager in 1995.\nDuring his thirty year career, he has been actively involved in the design of over thirty cars, including rally and race cars, as well as trucks and aeroplanes. He pioneered the European MPV with the design of the \"Supervan\" project, while at Chrysler Europe, which would later be developed by Matra, and would eventually reach production as the Renault Espace.Two of his designs have won the award for \"The Most Beautiful Car In The World\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Renault Espace", "response": ["The Espace concept was originally conceived in the 1970s by the British designer Fergus Pollock, who was working for Chrysler UK, at its design centre at Whitley in Coventry. Matra, spearheaded by Greek designer Antonis Volanis, developed the design for Simca, the then French subsidiary of Chrysler, with the intent of marketing the vehicle as a Talbot. It would replace the Matra Rancho leisure activity vehicle on the Matra production lines. Early prototypes used Simca parts, and hence featured a grille reminiscent of the Simca 1307 (Chrysler Alpine). "]}, {"page": "Chrysler Europe", "response": ["The British car designer Roy Axe, who originally started his career with Rootes, was responsible for unifying the designs of the new European range starting with the Simca 1307 (1975-86) family hatchback, which was sold in the UK as the Chrysler Alpine. The new pan-European model was assembled in France, Spain and Britain, and was voted European Car of the Year for 1976. Other influential designers who worked for the company in the 1970s and had a significant impact in car design in the 1980s were Geoff Matthews and Fergus Pollock. From this '70s period two outstanding projects were the Matra P18 prototype, which would later be developed into the MK1 Renault Espace, and the Matra Rancho which influenced the styling of the 1989 Land Rover Discovery."]}, {"page": "Robert Opron", "response": ["Another sketch by Opron at Simca has been suggested to have been the original concept for what later became the Renault Espace. Others dispute this claim, and the design of the Espace is generally credited to Fergus Pollock. In the late 1970s Matra designer Antoine Volanis addressed the need for a replacement for the Matra Rancho by designing an MPV using Simca parts and with input from Opron. This design was presented to PSA management in 1979 as \"Project P16\", but did not reach production. Opron was at Renault throughout most of the Espace's development and for one year after sales started."]}, {"page": "Pollock (surname)", "response": ["* Fergus Pollock, British automobile designer"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Fergus Pollock"]}]}}
