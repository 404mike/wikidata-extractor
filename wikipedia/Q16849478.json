Maria Willson) and Perfect World album"]}, {"page": "Never or Now", "response": ["\"I'll Wait For You\" is the first ballad on the album with a low-tempo light beat and piano sounds and synths, the song talks about being upset over a past relationship, the chorus' melody is similar to Kym Marsh's single \"Cry\". \"You're No Good for Me\" is a more rock-pop track which has drawn influences from bands who broke out during the mid 2000s such as Keane and Kaiser Chiefs, the low-tempo song lyrically is about knowing that you should walk away from a toxic relationship but keep being drawn back into it. The song was originally recorded by Maria Willson for her shelved 2003 album Alibi. \"Rush\" continues the rock-pop sound into the album which is more uptempo song which, like \"Give You My Love\" is similar to \"Lately\" in terms of lyrical context. The album track \"Never or Now\" is the most rock influenced track on the album with electric guitar running through the track which talks about having to make a tough decision in a relationship."]}, {"page": "Willson (name)", "response": ["* Maria Willson, British singer"]}, {"page": "Chooza Looza", "response": ["#REDIRECT Maria Willson"]}, {"page": "Willson, Maria", "response": ["#redirectMaria Willson"]}]}}
