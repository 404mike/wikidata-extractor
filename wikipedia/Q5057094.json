Wiggins signed a three-year contract on 30 June 2011, and made his debut in the starting eleven for a 3\u20130 opening-day win against his former club Bournemouth. He established himself in the left-back position ahead of fellow newcomer Cedric Evina. On 17 September, Wiggins scored his first goal for the club in the away win against Rochdale. He was nominated for League One Player of the Month award for October but lost out to Huddersfield Town's Jordan Rhodes. Wiggins set up two goals for Bradley Wright-Phillips in a 4\u20130 win over Hartlepool United on 29 October and one for Danny Hollands in a win over Preston North End a week later. He then helped the team's defence keep five clean sheets during January 2012, and maintained his contribution to the team's defensive strength with a run of six clean sheets from mid-March to mid-April 2012, the last of which, a 1\u20130 win away to Carlisle United, confirmed Charlton's promotion to the Championship.
