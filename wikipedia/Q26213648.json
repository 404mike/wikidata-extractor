Because of growing antisemitism in Germany the family left for Yugoslavia and later South Africa.  In 1948 Arnold Pomerans emigrated to England, where he became a full-time translator in the 1950s after first working as a teacher. He translated about two hundred works of fiction and non-fiction, selected from most European languages. Among the authors he translated are Louis de Broglie, Werner Heisenberg, Anne Frank, Sigmund Freud, Johan Huizinga, Jean Piaget, Jacques Presser and Jan Romein. His translation of George Grosz's autobiography A Little Yes and a Big No earned him the 1983 Schlegel-Tieck Prize and in 1997 he was awarded the PEN Translation Prize for The Selected Letters of Vincent Van Gogh. In his obituary he was called \"one of Britain's finest translators\" by The Independent.In 1956 he married Erica White and they moved to Polstead in Suffolk the following year. They carried out much of the translation work together.  He died in Polstead of cancer on 30 May 2005, aged 85.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vincent van Gogh", "response": ["Theo kept all of Vincent's letters to him; Vincent kept a few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo's widow Johanna arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914. Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a \"diary-like intimacy\", and read in parts like autobiography. The translator Arnold Pomerans wrote that their publication adds a \"fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted to us by virtually no other painter\"."]}, {"page": "Conscience", "response": ["The impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh wrote in a letter to his brother Theo in 1878 that \"one must never let the fire in one's soul die, for the time will inevitably come when it will be needed.

He who hears that voice, which is God's greatest gift, in his innermost being and follows it, finds in it a friend at last, and he is never alone!\u00a0...

By contrast Vincent infrequently kept letters sent to him and just 84 have survived, of which 39 were from Theo. Nevertheless, it is to these letters between the brothers that is owed much of what is known today about Vincent van Gogh. The only period where the public is relatively uninformed is the Parisian period when they shared an apartment and had no need to correspond. The letters effectively play much the same role in shedding light on the art of the period as those between the de Goncourt brothers do for literature.Pomerans (1997), xv\u2013xvii"]}, {"page": "Meadows near Rijswijk and the Schenkweg", "response": ["The studio cost 7 guilders a month to rent, and Mauve lent van Gogh 100 guilders to furnish it, insisting he had to have a bed.

He declared himself happy and content with the result. Nevertheless, the accommodation was of the simplest kind.
