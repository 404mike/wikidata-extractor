His portrayal of Holmes helped create the modern image of the detective. His use of the deerstalker cap (which first appeared in some Strand illustrations by Sidney Paget) and the curved pipe became enduring symbols of the character.Zecher, Henry, William Gillette, America's Sherlock Holmes (Xlibris Press, 2011), pp. 7, 9, 28, 328, 581. He assumed the role on stage more than 1,300 times over thirty years, starred in the silent motion picture based on his Holmes play, and voiced the character twice on radio.; Zecher website, ibid.", "Gillette's Sherlock Holmes consisted of four acts combining elements from several of Doyle's stories. He mainly utilized the plots \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" and \"The Final Problem\". Also, it had elements from A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four, The Boscombe Valley Mystery, and The Greek Interpreter. However, all the characters in the play were Gillette's own creations with the exception of Holmes, Watson, and Moriarty. His creation of Billy the Buttons (Pageboy) was later used by Doyle for \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\". Gillette portrayed Holmes as brave and open to express his feelings, which was substantially different from the intellectual-only original, \"a machine rather than a man\". He wore the deerstalker cap on stage, which was originally featured in illustrations by Sidney Paget.", "Gillette introduced the curved or bent briar pipe instead of the straight pipe pictured by Strand Magazine's illustrator Sidney Paget, most likely so that Gillette could pronounce his lines more easily; a straight pipe can wiggle or fall when speaking, or cause problems with declaring lines while it is clenched between the teeth. It is less difficult to pronounce lines clearly with a curved pipe. Some have lately theorized that a straight pipe may have obscured Gillette's face. This could not happen with a curved briar in his mouth."]}, {"page": "Reichenbach Falls", "response": ["Image:Fina-01.jpg|Holmes and Moriarty fighting at Reichenbach Falls, by Sidney Paget"]}, {"page": "The Final Problem", "response": ["The story was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1893, and in the US in McClure's in the same month.
