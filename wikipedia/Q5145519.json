Roberts also held diplomatic service posts in Japan and France.In April 2010, Roberts, acting on the instructions of David Miliband\u2014established a marine nature reserve around the Chagos Islands known as the Chagos Marine Protected Area. The designation proved controversial as the decision was announced during a period when the UK Parliament was in recess.On 1 December 2010 a leaked US Embassy London diplomatic cable dating back to 2009 exposed British and US calculations in creating the marine nature reserve. The cable relays exchanges between US Political Counselor Richard Mills and British Director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Colin Roberts, in which Roberts \"asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents.\" Richard Mills concludes:\n\nEstablishing a marine reserve might, indeed, as the FCO's Roberts stated, be the most effective long-term way to prevent any of the Chagos Islands' former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the [British Indian Ocean Territory].\nIn 2013 it was announced that Roberts had been appointed Governor of the Falkland Islands and Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, to take up office in April 2014. Alicia Castro, Argentina's ambassador to the United Kingdom, criticised Roberts's appointment as a \"provocation\" and said he was \"not the person to encourage dialogue between nations\".In June 2017 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced that Roberts would be leaving the Falklands, to be replaced as Governor and Commissioner by Nigel Phillips in September 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands", "response": ["|2014 ||2017|| Colin Roberts, CVO"]}, {"page": "Commissioner for the British Indian Ocean Territory", "response": ["* 2008\u20132012: Colin Roberts"]}, {"page": "List of Falkland Islands\u2013related topics", "response": ["* Colin Roberts"]}, {"page": "Index of Falkland Islands\u2013related articles", "response": ["*Colin Roberts (diplomat)"]}, {"page": "List of governors of the Falkland Islands", "response": ["| 2014 || 2017 || Colin Roberts "]}, {"page": "Nigel Haywood", "response": ["In late 2012, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced that Haywood would be leaving the Falkland Islands in April 2014, to be replaced as Governor and Commissioner by Colin Roberts.
