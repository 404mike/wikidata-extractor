He played every minute of United's promotion campaign to the Premier League in 2005\u201306. In February 2006 Sheffield United faced promotion rivals Reading. With the scores level at 1-1 Reading were awarded a last minute penalty, however Kenny saved Dave Kitson's effort. In November 2006, despite being told by club manager Neil Warnock to keep a low profile, Kenny went for a night out in Halifax. He became involved in a drunken brawl outside a curry house with a former friend, who admitted to having an affair with Kenny's wife. The fight ended with Kenny having his eyebrow bitten off and requiring 12 stitches. The affair brought an end to his marriage. He continued to be a key member of the United team in their season in the top flight but was unable to help prevent the club from being relegated on the final day of the 2006\u201307 season.

The departure of manager Gary Megson, Hoult returning to West Brom and further injury to Paul Gerrard presented Pedersen with another chance. Pedersen performed well in the eyes of many Forest fans and contributed to a resurgence in form which saw Forest climb to within two points of a play-off berth by the end of the season. The appointment of Colin Calderwood as the new manager of Nottingham Forest in June 2006 and the arrival of Southampton goalkeeper Paul Smith limited Rune to just a handful of appearances during the 2006-07 season.
