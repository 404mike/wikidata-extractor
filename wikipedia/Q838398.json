This year she celebrates the first ten years of her career, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics - Vol 1'. The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 'first lady of jungle'. Born to an Italian father and an Irish-Malaysian mother in Singapore, Rap spent her childhood traveling the world - Indonesia, Malta and Africa were all home for a while. ", "Charissa got back into the producers chair in early 1993 after hooking up with Aston Harvey, now half of the infamous Freestylers. The collaboration (known as Engineers Without Fears) spawned the singles 'Spiritual Aura' for the influential Deejay Recordings and 'Vertigo' and 'Jeopardy' for Suburban Base. All notched up impressive sales, leading the charge in the burgeoning Artcore movement which saw rich synth orchestration fused with a rattling club backend. \"The success of those early releases were the catalyst behind my decision to produce, engineer and release my own material,\" Charissa remembers. Following the release of 'Spiritual Aura,' Charissa approached Vinyl Distribution for a loan to establish her own label. Proper Talent launched in 1994 with its debut, the 25,000 selling 'Digable Bass,' followed by over twenty singles in the next five years. \"It was born out of love and wanting to express myself musically. I wanted to have the power to put great tunes out there and to work with a lot of different artists like Buju Banton, Top Cat, Outlaw Candy and MC Hooligan.\" As Proper Talent's reputation gathered pace, an outing for the respected 'Journeys By DJ' series and the release of her 'Intelligence' album secured her status as one to watch. 'Intelligence' was one of the first long players to be released by a drum & bass artist and saw Rap set the jungle roughage, which characterized much of the music of the time, adrift amongst the down tempo breakbeat that had initially drawn her into the dance movement. The breadth of this project paved the way for a major deal and, after some speculation, Charissa eventually signed with Sony's Higher Ground imprint in 1997, also home to Leftfield and Grooverider. \"When that deal came along I felt empowered to do something that would fulfill all my creative impulses. I'd fallen in love with making songs in the previous couple of years and working on that album was pure joy. No cliquey scene - just me in a studio making what I wanted.\" 'Learning Curve', her self-penned and produced debut for Sony, was released to widespread critical acclaim in 1998, fusing pop sensibilities with an underground production ethic.
