The main focus is on regulating and controlling blood feuds. The authorities (witan) are required to put a stop to vendettas following murders: the killer should instead pay wergeld (compensation) to the relatives of the victim. If no wergeld is paid, the killer has to bear the feud, but attacks on him are forbidden in churches and royal manor houses. If the killer's kin abandon him and refuse to contribute to a wergeld and to protect him, then it is the king's will that they are to be exempt from the feud: any of the victim's kin taking vengeance on them shall incur the hostility of the king and his friends and shall lose all their possessions. In the view of the historian Dorothy Whitelock the need for legislation to control the feud was partly due to the influx of Danish settlers who believed that it was more manly to pursue a vendetta than to settle a dispute by accepting compensation. Several Scandinavian loan words are first recorded in this code, such as hamsocn, the crime of attacking a homestead; the penalty is loss of all the offender's property, while the king decides whether he also loses his life. In contrast to Edmund's concern about the level of violence, he congratulated his people on their success in suppressing thefts. The code encourages greater local initiative in upholding the law, while emphasising Edmund's royal dignity and authority."]}, {"page": "Asser", "response": ["The title \"king of the Anglo-Saxons\" does, however, in fact occur in royal charters that date to before 892 and \"parochia\" does not necessarily mean \"diocese\", but can sometimes refer just to the jurisdiction of a church or monastery. In addition, there are other arguments against Leofric's having been the forger. Aside from the fact that Leofric would have known little about Asser and so would have been unlikely to construct a plausible forgery, there is strong evidence dating the Cotton manuscript to about 1000. The apparent use of Asser's material in other early works that predate Leofric also argues against Galbraith's theory. Galbraith's arguments were refuted to the satisfaction of most historians by Dorothy Whitelock in Genuine Asser, in the Stenton Lecture of 1967."]}, {"page": "Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon", "response": ["*Dorothy Whitelock (1957-1969)"]}, {"page": "Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland", "response": ["The authorship of the Old English Orosius is unknown. In the 12th century William of Malmesbury believed that it was the work of King Alfred himself, but scholarly scrutiny of the text since the mid-20th century, including by the historians Dorothy Whitelock and Janet Bately, has led to this view being refuted on lexical and syntactic grounds. Janet Bately believes that the Old English version of Orosius was created between 889 and 899, probably in the early 890s,, cited in . but there is no way of knowing whether Ohthere's account was previously in existence and incorporated from the outset, or if it was written down later and incorporated into a subsequent copy. The events that Ohthere described may have taken place at any time from the 870s to the late 890s, and Ohthere's account is given in the form of a third-person report of what he said to King Alfred, rather than as reported speech, as exemplified by the opening sentence: \"Ohthere s\u00e6de his hlaforde \u00c6lfrede kynincge \u00fe\u00e6t he ealra Nor\u00f0manna nor\u00f0mest bude.\" (\"Ohthere told his lord Alfred king that he lived northmost of all Norwegians.\") Dorothy Whitelock wrote that \"Ohthere's account reads like a set of replies to questions put to him.\", quoted in ."]}, {"page": "The Seafarer (poem)", "response": ["Dorothy Whitelock claimed that the poem is a literal description of the voyages with no figurative meaning, concluding that the poem is about a literal penitential exile."]}, {"page": "Sermo Lupi ad Anglos", "response": ["King \u00c6thelred II\u00a0\u2014 nicknamed \u00c6thelred 'The Unready' - ruled England from 978\u20131016. For virtually his entire reign, England was the object of successive Viking raids. Between the period of 980\u20131016, few areas of southern England remained unscathed as first Viking raiding parties, then entire Viking armies looted and ravaged the English countryside.Keynes, \"\u00c6thelred II (c.966x8\u20131016).\" \u00c6thelred, roundly criticised by historians as ineffectual in the face of the Viking onslaught, was never able to mount a successful offense against the nimble Viking fleets, and his efforts to defend his kingdom against Viking armies were continually undermined. \u00c6thelred and his advisors eventually adopted a policy of buying off the Viking armies with money. These enormous payments, known as Danegeld, had to be levied against English landowners and citizens, and this had a devastating impact on the English economy. Together, the Viking raids and the Danegeld payments brought the English people to their knees. But the Viking assaults continued. Few Englishmen during this time would have seen any reason to be optimistic about his own future or that of his countrymen. The situation became desperate in 1013, when, despite \u00c6thelred, a prominent leader of the Viking armies, Swein Forkbeard, managed to position himself as king of England. In response, \u00c6thelred retreated to Normandy where he remained until Swein's death the following year, upon which he immediately negotiated his safe return to England and his reinstatement as king. It is of these events that one of the versions of the Sermo Lupi makes mention. Wulfstan's role in these events are unclear, though sentiments he expresses elsewhere in his writings suggest that he would have supported \u00c6thelred's cause over any Dane's. Dorothy Whitelock writes that \"we have no evidence where Wulfstan was at the time of the submission [of England to Swein], but he was at York within a fortnight of [Swegn's] death, and we may suspect that he used his influence to win back the province to the English king \u00c6thelred.\"Whitelock, Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, p. 12."]}, {"page": "Hector Munro Chadwick", "response": ["In 1950, The Early Cultures of North-West Europe, a festschrift in Chadwick's honour edited by Cyril Fox and Bruce Dickins, his former students, was published.

Chadwick and Dorothy Whitelock both suggested that the name Hunbeanna should be divided into two names, Hun and Beanna, and that a tripartite division of the kingdom might have existed.

A reference derived from tradition can be found in the annal for 749 in the Historia Regum, a mediaeval work possibly produced in part by Byrhtferth of Ramsey. In the annal, it is stated that \"Hunbeanna and Alberht divided the kingdom of the East Angles between themselves\". Until the 1980s, this record stood alone and unverifiable, with the exception of a single coin attributed to Beonna and two other brief mentions of him. Since then, well over a hundred coins attributed to Beonna have been found, many in archaeologically secure contexts, so that it is now clear that a ruler named Beonna did rule in East Anglia at that time, as originally suggested in 1905 by the English historian H. M. Chadwick. The historian Steven Plunkett has suggested that the Hun- element in the annal was at some time joined with the -beanna element in error by a scribe. Marion Archibald, a numismatist at the British Museum for 33 years, and the historian  Dorothy Whitelock both asserted that the term Hunbeanna could be split into two separate names, Hun and Beonna. Archibald acknowledges that nothing at all is known of Hun, noting that the name may a hypocorism for a person with a name beginning in hun- or ending in -hun, whilst Whitelock partitions the kingdom of the East Angles between Alberht, Hun and Beonna."]}, {"page": "Seaxwulf", "response": ["Blair's \"reasonable conjecture\" suggests in effect that Seaxwulf may have been a member of local royalty, since Bede records the existence of a prince of the Gyrwas.

Also, while East Anglia had been under sustained attack from Mercia through much of the 7th century up to Seaxwulf's time, his contemporary King \u00c6thelhere of East Anglia is seen as a \"Mercian dependent\".Dumville, D., 'Essex, Middle Anglia, and the expansion of Mercia in the South-East Midlands', in Bassett, S. (ed.), The Origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms, Leicester University Press, 1989, p. 132. Thus the entire region in which Seaxwulf operated was, at the time, under Mercian domination.
