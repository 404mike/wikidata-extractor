He moved to Chicago in time to take advantage of the crowds attracted to the 1893 World's Fair. After developing a huge faith healing business in Chicago, with multiple homes and businesses, including a publishing house, to keep his thousands of followers, he bought an expansive amount of land north of the city to set up a private community.\nThere Dowie founded the city of Zion, Illinois, where he personally owned all the land and established many businesses. The operations of the city have been characterized as \"a carefully-devised large-scale platform for securities fraud...\" His lieutenant initiated an investigation of business practices and deposed him from leadership in 1905.

Sandford's erstwhile mentor, A. B. Simpson, is supposed to have remarked that Sandford would not be \"satisfied until he is extra-plenipotentiary with the Almighty Himself.\" As usual Sandford was also making an eschatological reference.
