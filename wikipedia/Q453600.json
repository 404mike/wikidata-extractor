His departure from Genesis on the eve of the group's breakthrough to mainstream popularity has led him to be popularly dubbed \"the Pete Best of progressive rock\" (though unlike Best, Phillips left his band voluntarily).Phillips released his first solo album, The Geese & the Ghost, in 1977.

After King suggested they stick to more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote \"The Silent Sun\" as a pastiche of the Bee Gees, one of King's favourite bands.

The group, who had been a full-time working band for less than a year, consisted of school friends from Charterhouse School, a private boarding school: singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, and bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford. Collins and Caryl arrived early, so Collins took a swim in the pool at Gabriel's parents' house and memorised the pieces the drummers before him were playing.
