After eloping with his wife, he was Rector for the Jamaican parish of St Dorothy until late 1817, and then Manchester from 1817 to 1823. He moved to become rector at the neighbouring parish of St Ann from 1823 to 1837. He published works against William Wilberforce and another book resulted in his London publisher being found guilty of libel against Louis Celeste Lecesne and John Escoffery. After his wife left him, he lost four of their daughters in a boating accident. Bridges went to Canada and returned to England to meet William Fox Talbot and take up photography. He toured around the Mediterranean taking 1,700 early pictures including Egypt, Greece, the Holy Land and Mount Etna erupting. His last parish was in Gloucestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Louvre Abu Dhabi", "response": ["In 2012, the Louvre Abu Dhabi started collecting photography, making its first acquisitions in the field, including works by Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, Roger Fenton and George Wilson Bridges.

Lushington argued in the House of Commons in an 1824 speech that they had been subject to discrimination based on skin colour detrimental to their constitutional rights. Lecesne and Escoffery were both slave-owners, a fact that Lushington took as establishing their social position. In March 1827, Lushington spoke in Parliament about a sermon given by Bridges in St Ann Parish, Jamaica against missionaries, and an attack on a mission house there."]}, {"page": "Maisemore", "response": ["*George Wilson Bridges was rector here in 1843 (where he found his interest in photography)Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography, Volume 1, John Hannavy, accessed September 2009]"]}, {"page": "Louis Celeste Lecesne", "response": ["The book concerned was \"The annals of Jamaica, Volume 2\" by the Reverend George Wilson Bridges.
