The story is set in Clayton County and Atlanta, both in Georgia, during the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era.

This historical novel features a coming-of-age story, with the title taken from the poem \u201cNon Sum Qualis eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae\u201d, written by Ernest Dowson.Margaret Mitchell, touched by the \"far away, faintly sad sound I wanted\" of the third stanza's first line, chose that line as the title of her novel Gone with the Wind. https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/SOURCE-of-the-TITLE-GWTW-Margaret-Mitchell-Gone-with-the-Wind", "The author tentatively titled the novel Tomorrow Is Another Day, from its last line.Jenny Bond and Chris Sheedy (2008), Who the Hell Is Pansy O'Hara?: The Fascinating Stories Behind 50 of the World's Best-Loved Books, Penguin Books, p. 96.

Harrison, editor and contributor to The Cambridge Companion to Horace (S. Harrison, The nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 337 Matthew Arnold advised a friend in verse not to worry about politics, an echo of Odes 2.11, yet later became a critic of Horace's inadequacies relative to Greek poets, as role models of Victorian virtues, observing: \"If human life were complete without faith, without enthusiasm, without energy, Horace...would be the perfect interpreter of human life.\"M. Arnold, Selected Prose, 74 Christina Rossetti composed a sonnet depicting a woman willing her own death steadily, drawing on Horace's depiction of 'Glycera' in Odes 1.19.5\u20136 and Cleopatra in Odes 1.37.Rossetti's sonnet, A Study (a soul), dated 1854, was not published in her own lifetime.

Housman considered Odes 4.7, in Archilochian couplets, the most beautiful poem of antiquityW. Flesch, Companion to British Poetry, 19th Century, 98 and yet he generally shared Horace's penchant for quatrains, being readily adapted to his own elegiac and melancholy strain.S. Harrison, The nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 339 The most famous poem of Ernest Dowson took its title and its heroine's name from a line of Odes 4.1, Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae, as well as its motif of nostalgia for a former flame. Kipling wrote a famous parody of the Odes, satirising their stylistic idiosyncrasies and especially the extraordinary syntax, but he also used Horace's Roman patriotism as a focus for British imperialism, as in the story Regulus in the school collection Stalky & Co., which he based on Odes 3.5.S. Medcalfe, Kipling's Horace, 217\u201339 Wilfred Owen's famous poem, quoted above, incorporated Horatian text to question patriotism while ignoring the rules of Latin scansion. However, there were few other echoes of Horace in the war period, possibly because war is not actually a major theme of Horace's work.S.

Together they produced Cynara (a setting of words by Ernest Dowson), A Late Lark (a setting of W. E.

McVeagh rates their greatest joint production as The Songs of Farewell, settings of Whitman poems for chorus and orchestra, which were dedicated to Jelka. Other works produced in this period include a Caprice and Elegy for cello and orchestra written for the distinguished British cellist Beatrice Harrison, and a short orchestral piece, Fantastic Dance, which Delius dedicated to Fenby. The violin sonata incorporates the first, incomprehensible, melody that Delius had attempted to dictate to Fenby before their modus operandi had been worked out.
