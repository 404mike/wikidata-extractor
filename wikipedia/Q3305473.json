The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as \"ghettoising children's programmes\" and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said \"On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There is a certain amount of overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of\u00a0... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing.\" Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: \"Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes.
