Acknowledging that \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" and \"The Final Problem\" are amongst the best-known Holmes stories, Gatiss explained, \"We knew after having a successful first run that the natural order would be to do three of the most famous [stories].\" \"There's the question of how to go out on a cliffhanger and then the thematic things of the three stories, where we were trying to get to and what Sherlock and John's relationship is a little further on.

The episode was inspired by Conan Doyle's story \"The Final Problem\", in which Holmes and Moriarty are presumed to have fallen to their deaths from the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland.

Atmospheric lighting was added by director of photography Stephan Pehrsson, who wanted to give it a movie feel. Moffat chose Stonehenge as the primary location for the episode because the monument was large and important enough to be suitable for the fall of someone as powerful as the Doctor. Filming was done at the real Stonehenge in Wiltshire on the night of 2 February 2010. The cast and crew had to abide by regulations; they were not allowed to touch the stones, bring heavy equipment in, and the lighting had to be done from the floor. They could only afford to shoot during one night and spent the only hour of daylight in the morning shooting a three-minute dialogue sequence. This proved to be a challenge, as it typically took an hour and a half to film similar scenes. The rest of the scenes set at Stonehenge were filmed with a lightweight replica set up in Margam Country Park called \"Foamhenge\" over four nights. Director Toby Haynes thought that they had \"established\" Stonehenge at the real site and now could get away with seeing less of it. The Doctor's speech to the alien spaceships was filmed 3 February, while Rory shooting Amy was shot on 4 February. The weather conditions were very cold with wind and rain which caused difficulties as it was hard to communicate over the wind.

The beginning of the episode, in which the fez-wearing Doctor from the future confronts Rory, was filmed on 5 February 2010 at Margam Country Park, Port Talbot. As it was filmed near the end of production of the series, \"The Big Bang\" had a smaller effects budget than other episodes, but this was compensated with cinematic lighting.

Filming took place in the state of Utah. For the opening shot for the location, director Toby Haynes wanted it to be epic so that the audience could recognise where the episode was set. Scenes on the roadway were filmed on U.S. Route 163 (several miles east of the coordinates listed on the Doctor's invitations). The crew wanted to add as many American icons as they could into those shots, including a Stetson hat, a 1950s Edsel Villager, and a yellow school bus. Moffat, having enjoyed writing episodes featuring River Song, wanted to give her an impressive entrance. Haynes had actress Alex Kingston block the sunlight from the camera angle and blow smoke from her revolver. The scenes involving the picnic and the future-Doctor dying took place on the shore of Lake Powell. The suit worn by the future-Doctor's killer was a fabricated replica of an Apollo space suit. In filming the death scene the filming crew noticed that Karen Gillan was genuinely upset and \"was acting her heart out.\" In filming the \"Viking funeral\" scene, Haynes wished to film it during the sunset.

Introducing the alien villains became a \"big challenge\" for the producers; it would tie in with the loose \"silence will fall\" arc that carried through the fifth series. Moffat did not wish to end the arc in the previous series, as he felt it would be \"more fun\" to continue it. Elsewhere in the episode, Delaware was written to be deceptively antagonistic towards the protagonists, which was based on actor Mark Sheppard's past as villains for his work in American television.
