The nature of the moor habitat has gradually been recognised as an ecological resource. From 1971 the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust has managed a small area of Crowle Moor for conservation, and the Nature Conservancy Council bought another small area in 1985. A major change occurred in 1994, when Fisons company gave English Nature  of moorland, although they retained the right to continue extracting peat on some of it. By 2002, Scotts owned the cutting rights but most cutting of peat effectively ended in 2001, since the government buy-out in 2002 of the extraction rights from Scotts occurred before the cutting season had begun. Removal of peat stockpiled on the moors continued into 2006. Since then the moors have been managed as a National Nature Reserve by Natural England. Scotts still have a works at Hatfield, which processes imported peat.", "====William Bunting====", "Although official attitudes did not place much value on the moors, William Bunting moved to Thorne after the Second World War and became an advocate for moor preservation. Thought to be rude and irascible, he began a campaign to recognise the ecological importance of the moors. He asserted that the enclosures of the 1800s, when common rights were replaced by private ownership, had been illegal, as was much of the commercial exploitation of his time. He seemed to have a good deal of evidence to support his claims, and took several major utilities to court over acts which he felt were illegal. He won a series of high-profile cases, which he used as publicity to advance the case for conserving the moors. In 1972, Bunting began direct action, aided by local residents, local naturalists, and students. During the week, the peat extraction company Fisons would cut drains to begin the process of lowering the water table. During the weekends, Bunting's Beavers, as his team became known, would walk onto the moors and construct dams across the new ditches, to retain the water levels. By the summer, the Beavers appeared to be winning the battle, and their activities were featured on BBC television. Fisons dynamited eighteen of the dams, but the activists were undeterred and began rebuilding them. Finally, Fisons conceded defeat, and negotiated with the Nature Conservancy Council on the future management of the moors in 1974. The government granted some  Site of Special Scientific Interest status in 1981. Although this had little immediate effect, it has contributed to subsequent appreciation of the area and its importance as an ecological resource."]}, {"page": "Bunting's Beavers", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bunting (eco-warrior)"]}, {"page": "Bunting (surname)", "response": ["*Christopher William Bunting (1837\u20131896), Irish-born Canadian politician", "*William Bunting (1874\u20131947), English rugby player", "*William Bunting (eco-warrior) (1916\u20131995), English environmentalist and eco-warrior"]}, {"page": "William Bunting, eco-warrior", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bunting (eco-warrior)"]}, {"page": "William Bunting eco warrior", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bunting (eco-warrior)"]}, {"page": "William Bunting (eco warrior)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bunting (eco-warrior)"]}, {"page": "William Bunting of Thorne", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bunting (eco-warrior)"]}, {"page": "William Bunting, environmentalist", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bunting (eco-warrior)"]}, {"page": "William Bunting (environmentalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bunting (eco-warrior)"]}]}}
