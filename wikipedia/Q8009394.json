He achieved these last half dozen wins in Bristol number A7243 with Davison at the controls. Morgan's final tally was five enemy fighters and a reconnaissance plane destroyed, with an equal slate being driven down out of control.

The next day, a German two-seater fell from his guns, out of control southwest of Lille. Two days later, Waight destroyed a Pfalz D.III southeast of Lille. On 21 August, the victim was another unidentified German two-seater down out of control, this time over Ervillers. The next day, 22 August 1918, the crew of Waight and Harvey scored their last victory together; teamed with other crews from 22 Squadron, they destroyed a Halberstadt reconnaissance two-seater northeast of Bailleul.
