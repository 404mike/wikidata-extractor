Inspired by the British TV satirical revue TV shows of the period (notably That Was The Week That Was), \"Mavis Bramston\" was the first successful venture in this genre on Australian TV. At its peak it was one of the most popular Australian TV programs of its era and it propelled many of the 'classic' cast to national stardom in Australia, including original's Gordon Chater, Carol Raye (who was already a major star in England as a film star) and Barry Creyton, as well as June Salter,  Noeline Brown, and Ron Stevens ", "The Mavis cast, which changed considerably over its three-year run, initially featured many imported or expatriate British performers such as Gordon Chater, Carol Raye, Miriam Karlin, Ronnie Stevens and  Hazel Phillips, alongside experienced Australian actors such as John Bluthal who was becoming well known in Britain, and Australian performers such as June Salter, Barry Creyton, Ron Frazer, Barbara Angell, Noeline Brown and Reg Livermore, who were relative newcomers to TV but who, between them, had decades of experience in music, theatre, cabaret and revue.", "*British-born actor Gordon Chater (1964\u201365), who migrated to Australia in the late 1940s and became prominent in theatre and radio", "Inspired by the BBC's That Was The Week That Was, Raye suggested a show based on TW3's format of topical satire, and although initially skeptical, Oswin agreed and allocated a budget of AU\u00a31500 for pilot episode. Raye then set about recruiting performers to fill the roles of TW3's stars Millicent Martin, Bernard Levin and David Frost. By chance, she had also been given an introduction to Gordon Chater, who immediately accepted her offer on the expectation that the new show would be a TV version of the famous Phillip St Revues, in which he had been starring.", "The show opened with a heavily made-up Noeline Brown (as Mavis) in a mock interview with Jon Finlayson after which she performed a (deliberately awful) song-and-dance routine. The sketches included topical items about then Prime Minister Robert Menzies and the Voyager disaster; Oz co-editor Richard Walsh provided an \"Oz News\" segment; Gordon Chater performed his popular slapstick routine, in which he performed a comic monologue while covering himself with food then squirting the resulting mess off with a soda siphon; there was also a serious interlude with a reading of a poem written by Kath Walker, later known as Oodgeroo Noonuccal. The show concluded with the cast singing \"Friends and Neighbours\" off-camera, while footage of mob violence, war scenes and Ku Klux Klan rallies was played on screen.Noeline Brown, Noeline: Longterm Memoir (Hodder & Stoughton, Sydney, 2005), p.89", "Mavis almost immediately attracted controversy, but this only served to heighten its notoriety. Some local stations censored 'blasphemous' words and the term \"kin oath\" (a contraction of the Australian expletive \"fuckin' oath\") and in March 1965 Sydney Catholic clergyman Bishop Thomas Muldoon publicly announced that he intended to sell his shares in Ampol because it sponsored such an 'immoral' show. When one of the stars was quizzed by the press about the furore, they expressed surprise that a bishop would own shares, but this immediately generated more banner headlines declaring \"Actor insults Bishop\". According to Noeline Brown it was Barry Creyton who made the remarkNoeline Brown, Noeline: Longterm Memoir (Allen & Unwin, Sydney, 2005, ), p.97 but another source quotes Gordon Chater as saying that he made the comment.Poms In Oz Forum \u2013 \"Gordon Chater\u2019s Chuckle At The World\"", "When the show went national Carol Raye quickly found that juggling performance and production with the demands of raising a young family were becoming too much, so Seven agreed to recruit a co-producer; on Gordon Chater's suggestion they hired Michael Plant, who had started out writing scripts for radio star Grace Gibson before moving to Los Angeles, where he worked in film and TV. He was also an experienced journalist, which assisted with the topical nature of the show's humour.", "During 1965\u201366 the focus of the sketches gradually shifted from topical political humour to broader social satire and more conventional revue-style material. Popular sketches included Chater's famous \"Pie Eater\" routine, in which he played a stereotypical Ocker character in a singlet and handkerchief hat, who crams pies into his mouth while extolling the virtues of the \"June Dilly-Potkins School of Charm\" (a joke on the real-life deportment schools founded by former model June Dally-Watkins). Another recurring sketch was devised by and featured Miriam Karlin who, with Gordon Chater, played an elderly couple who sit on a park bench and talk to each other without communicating.", "At the end of the year Gordon Chater announced that he was leaving the series.
