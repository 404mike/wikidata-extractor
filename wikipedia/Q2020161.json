In the early 1960s, he loses faith in the ideals he was brought up with, and works as a spy and assassin for the Russians during the Cold War. His story is mostly revealed in flashbacks.", "Seventeen years after World War II, Thomas, now played by Ed Stoppard, has himself become a Soviet soldier of officer rank. Among other things, it transpires that Thomas had been trained in a Suvorov Military School and later he was admitted into the Soviet Military Intelligence, having served with distinction in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Thomas then resigns from the military. No reason is given. In his apartment he boxes-up his belongings, which include military decorations, a painting depicting refugees and soldiers and many old photographs, several of himself and Tanya at the end of the war and standing outside the military school. But he gazes particularly at a photo of Melanie. Next it unfolds that Thomas has been recruited by the KGB. He sits in a briefing with two KGB Officers, Krivosheyev (Benedek Gulya) and Sokolov (Peter Kertesz) and is shown a film which features a former Nazi Gestapo officer denouncing his past and pledging allegiance to the USSR. Thomas is told that Albert Steiner, the man in the film, had become one of the KGB agents in London, but that he had defected to the British and subsequently vanished. As a consequence the rest of Steiner's London contacts were also under suspicion. Thomas is sent on a mission to London in order to join Steiner's former cell and to observe the loyalty of the agents within it."]}, {"page": "Nick Caldecott", "response": ["In 2008 he starred in She Stoops To Conquer at the Nuffield Theatre, Southampton and as John Middleton Murry alongside Ed Stoppard in the DH Lawrence biopic On the Rocks at the Hampstead Theatre.
