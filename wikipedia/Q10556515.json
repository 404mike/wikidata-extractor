On 19 September 1953, Southampton were away to Walsall for the first-ever league match between the two teams. The match ended in a 1\u20130 defeat and the team were criticised by the club chairman: \"for a team to stroll onto the field and meander about in a Saintly manner of 'all's well with the world' is plumb inexcusable\". Hoskins lost his place to Derek Digby before returning six matches later. Hoskins was in and out of the side until mid-February before playing on the left in the final 17 matches, scoring another six goals. Having been second in the division at the end of January, the Saints managed only four further victories to slide down to finish sixth in the table."]}]}}
