Besides the plots to assassinate him by agents of the Queen of England, the rebels against the rule of the Spanish Crown, encouraged by Elizabeth and her emissaries, now present in Douai, expelled the students of the University from Douai in March 1578. Allen then re-established the College at Rheims, a city then under the patronage and protection of the House of Guise. The collegians took refuge at the University of Rheims, where they were well received, and continued their work as before, and Allen was soon afterwards elected a canon in the Chapter of Rheims Cathedral. Thomas Stapleton, Richard Bristow, Gregory Martin, and Morgan Phillips were amongst Allen's companions."]}, {"page": "Douay\u2013Rheims Bible", "response": ["A run of a few hundred or more of the New Testament, in quarto form (not large folio), was published in the last months of 1582 (Herbert #177), during a temporary migration of the college to Rheims; consequently, it has been commonly known as the Rheims New Testament. Though he died in the same year as its publication, this translation was principally the work of Gregory Martin, formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford, close friend of Edmund Campion. He was assisted by others at Douai, notably Allen, Richard Bristow, and Thomas Worthington, who proofed and provided notes and annotations. The Old Testament is stated to have been ready at the same time but, for want of funds, it could not be printed until later, after the college had returned to Douai. It is commonly known as the Douay Old Testament. It was issued as two quarto volumes dated 1609 and 1610 (Herbert #300). Surprisingly these first New Testament and Old Testament editions followed the Geneva Bible not only in their quarto format but also in the use of Roman type."]}, {"page": "English College, Douai", "response": ["Only a few years after foundation, Allen's personality and influence had attracted more than 150 students to the college. A steady stream of controversial works issued from Douai, some by Allen himself, others by such men as Thomas Stapleton and Richard Bristow. It was at the English College at Douai that the English translation of the Bible known as the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible was completed in 1609.  However, the college did see opposition from the university and town, with all the English at Douai expelled in 1578 and the college finding a temporary base at Rheims.Schofield, Nicholas. \"From Douay to Allen Hall\", Diocese of Westminster The College did hold onto the house at Douai, however, and returned to it in 1593 (though without Allen, who had been called to reside in Rome, where he died on 16 October 1594)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Baily", "response": ["Baily was an undergraduate at Clare Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1546. Soon after he became a Fellow of that house and was promoted to the degree of Master of Arts in 1549. In 1554 he was appointed a Proctor and in the following year he subscribed to the Roman Catholic Articles. About November, 1557, he was appointed Master of Clare College and in 1558 received the further degree of Bachelor of Divinity. In the same year, Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne of England, and efforts were made by the Church of England party at Cambridge to gain recruits to its ranks, but Baily refused to conform to Anglicanism. As a consequence, he was deprived of his Mastership. He next visited Louvain, where he remained until 30 January 1576, during the interval receiving the degree of Doctor of Divinity. From Louvain he went to the English College, Douai, at the invitation of William Allen (afterwards Cardinal), during whose absence he usually filled the position of President of the English College, both while it was at Douai and later while it was in Reims. He finally left Reims on 27 January 1589, returning to Douai, where he remained until his death. He was associated with Cardinal Allen in the management of the college, the distribution of the labour being that Allen had charge of the great discipline, Baily of the temporal affairs, and Richard Bristow, another of Allen's collaborators, of the seminarians' studies."]}, {"page": "Gregory Martin (scholar)", "response": ["In preparing the translation he was assisted by several of the other scholars then living in the English College, Douai, the most noteworthy of which were Thomas Worthington, Richard Bristowe, William Rainolds (Reynolds), and William Cardinal Allen, but Father Martin made the whole translation in the first instance and bore the brunt of the work throughout.", "It was during the four years after his return to Reims from Rome (1578\u20131582) that Father Martin settled to a Catholic translation of the Bible. The Reformers continually quoted their versions; Allen wanted to meet them on their own ground. He determined to attempt the work at his college, and deputed Martin to undertake the translation. Thomas Worthington, Richard Bristow, William Rainolds, and Allen himself were to assist in revising the text and preparing suitable notes to the passages which were most used by the Protestants."]}, {"page": "John Hammond (died 1589)", "response": ["In the period March 1580 \u2013 1581 Hammond took part in the examination by torture of Thomas Myagh, a prisoner in the Tower, charged with treasonable correspondence with Irish rebels. From 1572 onwards he was an active member of the ecclesiastical court of high commission. In May 1581 he examined Alexander Briant, a Jesuit, under torture in the Tower of London, and later in the year conducted repeated examinations of Edmund Campion, preparing points for discussion out of Nicholas Sander's De Monarchia and Richard Bristow's Motives. On 29 April 1582 he similarly dealt with Thomas Alfield, a seminary priest, who was racked in the Tower."]}, {"page": "Bristow (surname)", "response": ["*Richard Bristow (1538\u20131581), English Catholic writer", "*Richard Bristowe (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Richard Bristowe (religious writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Bristow"]}, {"page": "Robert Maudhuy", "response": ["*1607: Richard Bristow, Antihaeretica Motiva, vol. 2.
