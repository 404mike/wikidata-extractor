By November it seemed a matter of when and not if Stoke would gain promotion but their form completely dropped off and just one win was registered from the end of November to March. Chief executive Jez Moxey was now coming in for some serious pressure to resign by the supporters due to the poor finances and with no chance of promotion Stoke finished in 8th place with 69 points. Little had since lost interest way before the end of the season and he resigned in July leaving Stoke to find another manager.", "Chief executive Jez Moxey predicted that Stoke would lose around \u00a31 million a year through being in the Second Division, such was the price Stoke had to pay after poor financial mismanagement on moving to the Britannia Stadium.

SOS wanted to starve out the current board and force them to sell in order to breathe fresh life back into the club.

On the pitch Stoke's run came to an end at Fulham and new signing Chris Short had breathing problems and had to be carried off, which would disrupt the balance of the team and his condition would eventually end his career.
