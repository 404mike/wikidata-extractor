This discussion is largely romanticised and aimed at demonstrating a lineage of \"armed struggle\" from which the IRA assumes its legitimacy in the fight against \"occupying forces in Ireland\".

The 1956 manual also implies that the bulk of the IRA's work in \"freeing Ireland from occupation\" is over. This indicates both a \"southern\" perspective on Irish independence and an underestimation of the resistance they would encounter during the Border Campaign, that was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland.
