He instantly became a regular under Frank Taylor establishing himself at Left back with ease. Although playing outside the top division, his talents were soon spotted by the England selectors. After winning caps at youth and under-23 levels, he was called up for the full international side for a British Home Championship match against Wales in place of Jimmy Armfield on 17 October 1959. The match was drawn 1\u20131 and Allen was retained for the next two matches, against Sweden (a 2\u20133 defeat) and Northern Ireland (won 2\u20131). For the next international match the following April, Ray Wilson was preferred at left-back, remaining first choice for most of the next decade. Although he received further caps at under-23 level (earning seven in all) Allen was never selected again for the full England eleven.
