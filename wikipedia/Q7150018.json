The Blues were managed at the time by Ian Porterfield and Colgan was designated as the third choice keeper at Stamford Bridge behind Dmitri Kharine and Kevin Hitchcock. In February 1993, Porterfield was sacked and was replaced by player-manager Glenn Hoddle, who in turn put Colgan up for loan. In September 1993, Colgan was signed by Dario Gradi in a one-month loan spell with Crewe Alexandra, however he failed to make an appearance for the club and soon returned to Stamford Bridge. During the 1994\u20131995 season joined up with Alan Buckley at Grimsby Town who used him as a deputy keeper to Paul Crichton, but also Colgan went unused at Blundell Park during his spell in Humberside.

Colgan had filled in for the then current first choice Frode Grodas who sat the game out on the bench. The Chelsea team that day featured the likes of Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli, Dan Petrescu, Dennis Wise and Mark Hughes. That season Chelsea won the 1996-97 FA Cup. Colgan was on the bench in the semi final against Wimbledon but for the match day squad of the final Kevin Hitchcock was on the bench instead of Colgan. The West Hame game would be his only taste of first team football for Chelsea, however he would go on to make 5 loan appearances each for both Brentford and Reading during the 1997\u20131998 season.
