His death in the 1924 San Sebastian Grand Prix brought an end to the practice of riding mechanics in two-seat racing cars.Racing in this early period was conducted between unreliable cars over long road courses, rather than by repeated laps of a dedicated short circuit. There was no nearby \"pit lane\" in which to conduct repairs and so it was necessary to carry a mechanic on board the car.", "link_mentions": {}}}
