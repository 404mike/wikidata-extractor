There was no nearby \"pit lane\" in which to conduct repairs and so it was necessary to carry a mechanic on board the car.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grand Prix motor racing", "response": ["During this period a lot of changes of rules occurred. There was a mass start for the first time at the 1922 French Grand Prix in Strasbourg. The 1925 season was the first season during which no riding mechanic was required in a car, as this rule was repealed in Europe after the death of Tom Barrett the previous year. At the 1926 Solituderennen a well thought-out system, with flags and boards, giving drivers tactical information, was used for the first time by Alfred Neubauer, the racing manager of the Mercedes-Benz team.
