Burns then scored all of his club's points with two converted tries. Burns has since played many games at fly-half and fullback, including an April 2010 performance against Saracens. In this game he was named the man of the match as a reward for his outstanding kicking from hand, goal kicking and composure under the high ball. The highlight of this match was when Burns chipped over a rushing Saracen defence allowing Charlie Sharples to score a vital try in the corner."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 LV Cup", "response": ["|FB ||15|| Olly Morgan "]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Millfield", "response": ["* Olly Morgan, Gloucester and England rugby player"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Premiership Rugby", "response": ["* 9 October 2013 Olly Morgan (Gloucester) retired, aged 27, due to knee injuries."]}]}}
