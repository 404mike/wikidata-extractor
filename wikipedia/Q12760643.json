In June 1915, at the height of World War I, Serbia instituted a sub-division of the War Merit Order, called the Military Order, which was awarded to NCOs and men for bravery in combat. The War Merit Order was divided into two classes: the 1st division Gold Cross and the 2nd division Silver Cross. One of the recipients of the Military Order was the highly decorated female soldier Milunka Savi\u0107, and another was Flora Sandes, the only British woman to openly serve as a soldier in the war.

The wives of the representatives of the Serbian Government at the various courts of Europe helped Grouitch raise money for it. Mabel was particularly interested in establishing an agricultural course for girls in connection with the University of Belgrade, because, according to Mabel, a son cannot be spared to go and study agriculture since sons must enter the army, a daughter could be spared and then return home to share with her family what she had learned. Mabel Grouitch raised a large sum of money from her friends in the United States to assist with these endeavors. Grouitch raised money for the Serbian Red Cross during the Balkan Wars.
