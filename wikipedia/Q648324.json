He played for Kent from 1958 to 1976, usually opening the batting, then in 1985, in an emergency, played in one more match against the Australians. He was cricket manager from 1981 to 1986, then became Cricket Administrator. He went on to become President of the Club, and held that position until his death. He played 355 matches for Kent and represented England in 21 Test matches and three one day internationals.\nOver his entire career Luckhurst totalled 22,303 runs (average 38.12) in first-class cricket. He scored 1,000 runs in a season 14 times, his highest total for a season being 1,194 (average 47.85) in 1969. He scored 48 centuries, with a highest score of 215 against Derbyshire at Derby in 1973.\nAlthough primarily a batsman, Luckhurst was technically an all-rounder. He took 64 wickets (average 42.87) with slow left arm spin (although he batted right-handed). On the rare occasions when he was called upon to bowl in a Test match, it was regarded as an indication that the result of the match was a foregone conclusion. He only took one Test wicket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 5", "response": ["*1939 \u2013 Brian Luckhurst, English cricketer (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["There was no tour in 1966\u201367 and Cowdrey was not picked for the first four Tests of the summer, instead concentrating on Kent's chances in the County Championship. He was recalled for the Second Test against Pakistan, opening the innings, and made 14 and 2 not out in the 10 wicket victory. The Third Test at the Oval was won as well, but Close had been found guilty of time-wasting in a county match and accosting a spectator who complained of gamesmanship. He was fired as soon as the Test was won and the selectors announced that Cowdrey was to lead the MCC tour of the West Indies, although he disliked the politics and press attention.Cowdrey, pp. 171\u201375 On a happier note Kent came second in the County Championship to Yorkshire and won their first one-day competition, the Gillette Cup final against Somerset in front of 20,000 fans at Lord's. Cowdrey won the toss and batted first, Kent making 193 with man of the match Mike Denness scoring 50 and Brian Luckhurst 54. Somerset were bowled out for 161 with Derek Underwood taking 3/41 for a 32 run victory. ", "Cowdrey had other considerations in the summer of 1970, which was Kent County Cricket Club's Centenary. Kent had been 13th in the County Championship in his first year as captain in 1957, but had improved and were runners up in 1967 and 1968. The county has been short of funds throughout the 60s, but agreed to increase resources for extra staff for the 1970 season, which could only be justified by winning the County Championship for the first time since 1913. Apart from their energetic overseas player Asif Iqbal and the Scottish Mike Denness they had home-grown talent in the shape of Alan Knott, Derek Underwood, Bob Woolmer, Brian Luckhurst, and Alan Ealham. At the start of the season Edward Heath, Kent fan and leader of the Conservative Party, gave a speech at their dinner, saying that 1906 had seen Kent win their first County Championship alongside a change of government and they should do so again in 1970.Cowdrey, p. 211", "Cowdrey was made vice-captain for an Australian tour for the fourth time and Illingworth's tough no-nonsense approach to the game clashed with the MCC tour manager David Clark, who had been captain of Kent in Cowdrey's youth and had given him his county cap. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour with the support of the players and Clark's influence declined,Snow, pp. 94\u201395Swanton, pp. 150\u201351 as did that of Cowdrey, who as his only ally he became isolated, though he still had his Kent teammates Derek Underwood, Alan Knott and Brian Luckhurst.Snow, p. 110 The players tended to avoid the press and public, even to the point of having their meals in their hotel rooms, and only Cowdrey made an effort to meet and greet the cricket fans. The rotund Cowdrey was in the sunset of his career and failed on tour, making only one century \u2013 101 against Victoria \u2013 which was so slow that he was likened to a beached whale.Richard Whitington, Captains Outrageous? Cricket in the Seventies, Stanley Paul (1972), p. 54", "Cowdrey showed he had lost none of his timing and that his bat was as straight as ever until he was bowled behind his legs by Thomson (2/45) for 22. In the second innings he volunteered to open with David Lloyd instead of the badly bruised Brian Luckhurst. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, his highest score of the series. After the Second Test Cowdrey made 78 and took 2/27 against South Australia. Before the Third Test at Melbourne Frank Tyson recalled \"Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich were unable to practice on Christmas Eve \u2013 mainly because of the drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two-hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents\".Tyson, p. 85 He played his 114th and last Test at Melbourne, and opened the innings again as Lloyd was injured, but only made 7. Even so, England made 529 and won by an innings, with Cowdrey dismissing Rick McCosker for his 120th catch. He was given a warm farewell by his fans in \"an impromptu little gathering on the outfield in front of the banner reading 'M.C.G. FANS THANK COLIN \u2013 6 TOURS'.

Cool, damp conditions on the first three days favoured the seam bowlers who were able to make the ball \"swing freely\". The main exponents were Basil D'Oliveira and Tony Greig (on debut) for England and Eddie Barlow for the World XI. Key innings were played by Clive Lloyd for the World and Ray Illingworth for England which left the match finely poised after completion of first innings, England having a slender lead of three runs. Barlow dominated proceedings on the Saturday and his defiant 142 accounted for virtually half his team's second innings total. D'Oliveira and Greig were again the best of the bowlers. The World innings ended on Monday morning and England had seven sessions in which to score 284. The weather had improved over the weekend and Monday was a bright day which produced a slow-paced pitch. Even so, England were still without Geoff Boycott and their batsmen proceeded with caution, especially Brian Luckhurst who batted for seven hours and played a \"dogged innings\" of 113 not out to see England home with four hours to spare on Tuesday.", "Geoff Boycott returned to the England team and, with perhaps a nod towards the venue, the selectors also picked his Yorkshire colleagues Don Wilson and the 21-year-old Chris Old. The World XI decided to strengthen their batting and Mushtaq Mohammad replaced Peter Pollock. Gary Sobers won the toss and Wisden recalled that he gambled by putting England in to bat \"on a slow-drying pitch\". Having struggled to reach 209 for four after a very poor start, England disintegrated completely in the face of a remarkable piece of bowling by Eddie Barlow who took four wickets in five balls, emulating the feat of Maurice Allom in New Zealand in 1930\u201331. Barlow dismissed Keith Fletcher, England's top scorer, and Alan Knott came in to bat. Barlow dismissed Knott second ball and then completed a hat trick by dismissing Chris Old and Don Wilson with his next two deliveries. The World XI's batting was impacted by back injuries sustained by Barry Richards and Rohan Kanhai while fielding. Richards could not open the innings so Deryck Murray was promoted and he scored a determined 95 in five hours but the World XI were on 152 for four when Gary Sobers came in to rally them, in Wisden's words, \"with another splendid century\". Once again, England staged a second innings recovery with half-centuries by Boycott, Brian Luckhurst, Fletcher and Ray Illingworth. Barlow with five for 78 completed a match analysis of twelve for 142. Needing 223 to win with a day and a half to go, the World XI slumped to 62 for five on the Monday afternoon. This brought Sobers and Intikhab together and they survived to the close with the overnight score at 75 for five. They needed another 148 to win and two of their remaining batsmen were the injured Kanhai and Richards. On Tuesday morning, a crucial incident occurred at 82 for five when Tony Greig at second slip dropped Intikhab off John Snow. Wisden reckoned that England would have won and squared the series if the catch had been taken. Intikhab and Sobers steadily moved the score forward until both were out shortly before lunch. Kanhai, batting despite his injury, was out immediately after lunch and the World XI were then on 183 for eight with 40 more needed.

The weak Australian bowling was unable to dismiss them twice in the same Test, except the last which they lost anyway. They were exceptionally strong at the top of the order; Boycott and Luckhurst opened in the first five Tests, then Boycott and Edrich in the 6th and Edrich and Luckhurst in the 7th as injuries took hold. Together they added 995 runs for the first wicket at an average of 90.45, with five century and three half-century opening stands. The \"Great Accumulator\"p23, Gower Geoff Boycott had his best series making 657 runs (93.85) with two unbeaten centuries and his name became a byword for long, stonewalling innings. It is noteworthy that he performed best under Illingworth, an old Yorkshire colleague of great seniority who had no objection to his slow, deliberate play. John Edrich also had his most prolific series, making 648 runs (72.00) and two centuries, a stalwart left-hander with a formidable defence and always a thorn in Australia's side.p227, Arnoldp172, Swanton, 1986 Brian Luckhurst was a Kent opener who had already 'debuted' against the Rest of the World and made an unbeaten 113 in England's only victory. He did well again, making 455 runs (56.87) and two centuries despite badly bruised fingers, but unlike Boycott he was willing to hit the ballp69, Kelly and was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1971. England's middle order was more fragile. In 1970 the vice captain Colin Cowdrey was the only man to have played over a hundred Tests and had made more runs (7,228) than any other player, but was in the sunset of his career and failed on tour. He had always dreamed of leading England to victory in Australia, but each of his record six tours down under was made under a different captain and this was his fourth as vice-captain. Keith Fletcher was at the start of a promising career and had made few runs as yet, but in the 1970s he would become a leading England runmaker. Basil d'Oliveira was the best of the strokemakers, making 369 runs (36.90) in the series with a century at Melbourne. He was a brilliant Cape-Coloured batsman who qualified for England by residence in his mid-thirties, an unflappable player with a low backlift and powerful arms whose gentle, smiling face concealed a very determined man.p155, Swanton, 1977 His match-winning 158 against Australia at the Oval in 1968 led to his selection for the 1968-69 tour of South Africa and a cricketing crisis. John Hampshire was a dashing Yorkshire batsman who is the only England player to make a century on debut at Lord's, 107 against the West Indies in 1969, but never made another and was dropped after a short Test career. England's lower middle order added real strength with the wicket-keeper Alan Knott worth his place for his perky, unorthodox batting alone. Skipper Ray Illingworth made 476 runs (52.89) against the Rest of the World in 1970 and did well again in Australia. John Snow began and ended his cricketing life as a batsman and in 1969-71 averaged 34.50 in Tests, so could be regarded as another all-rounder.", "* Brian Luckhurst and Mike Baldwin, Boot Boy to President, KOS Media, 2004"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1974\u201375", "response": ["The England batsmen had gorged themselves on the Indian spin bowling in the summer of 1974; David Lloyd averaged 260.00, Keith Fletcher 189.00, John Edrich 101.50, Mike Denness 96.33, Dennis Amiss 92.50 and Tony Greig 79.50. They did well in the rain-affected series against Pakistan and were chosen en masse for the tour of Australia, along with Geoff Boycott who had missed most of the summer due to poor form. Boycott declined to tour and was replaced by Brian Luckhurst, a Kent opener who had made 455 runs (56.87) in 1970-71 and two centuries despite badly bruised fingersp69, Kelly None of these had any great experience in facing fast bowling, which had been in short supply in the last few years of Test cricket. This was not seen as a problem as Australian pitches were usually good for batting or spin and while Dennis Lillee had recovered from his back injury he was not seen as a problem. The pipe-smoking Dennis Amiss was a heavy run-maker for Warwickshire who had once carried his bat for 262 out of 432 against the West Indies in 1973-74, but was bounced out of cricket by the Australian and West Indian fast bowlers of the mid-1970s. He returned with a square on stance to make 203 against Michael Holding at the Oval in 1976. David Lloyd made 214 not out against India in his second Test, but failed to make another 50 in Tests and never played after this tour. In 1965 John Edrich made a record 310 not out New Zealand in the Third Test at Headingley with a record 52 fours and 5 sixes, but was hit on the head by a Peter Pollock bouncer in his next Test, forcing him to retire hurt and thereafter he had a distaste for fast bowling. He changed into a solid and unspectacular accumulator of runs and in the 1970-71 Ashes series he batted for a record 33 hours and 26 minutes making 648 runs (72.00) and two centuries.p227, Arnoldp172, Swanton, 1986 Keith Fletcher had a promising career, but like most of the England batsmen was a player of spin with limited technique against real pace and suffered as a result, but came back to make 146 in the Sixth Test and later became a successful captain of Essex. Colin Cowdrey was the first man to have played in a hundred Tests and was asked to reinforce the England squad after the injuries suffered in the First Test. This was his record sixth tour of Australia and he played in the Second Test in Perth just two days after arriving from England. The 6'7\" South African born Tony Greig was England's best batsman of the tour, using his height to slash the fast bowlers over the slips and having the advantage of batting at number 6 after the earlier batsmen had faced the brunt of the bowling. The wicketkeeper Alan Knott who came in at number 7 was the next best batsmen, a perky, Punch-like character with a sound defence and some unorthodox shots. Fred Titmus had had great success with the bat on his previous tours in 1962-63 and 1965-66 and had a Test average of 48.89 in Australia.

Alan Knott came in as nightwatchman and was bounced by Thomson in the poor light, Jack Fingleton claiming that 'He can be excused. he doesn't know where he is bowling.'.p82, Whitington In the morning \u2013 the first Sunday's play at the Gabba \u2013 Knott took his score to 73, joined by John Edrich (79) and Basil d'Oliveira (57) as they slowly batted into the fourth afternoon with the crowd giving them a slow hand-clap. The Monday was a rest day with three and a half inches of rain falling, but the wicket was covered, so there would be no danger of a gluepot as in the 1950\u201351 Brisbane Test. The following day Colin Cowdrey (28) overtook Wally Hammond's record of 7,249 runs to become the most prolific Test batsmen, which earned him an ovation from the crowd. The \"Golden Arm\" of Doug Walters was able to both swing the ball and produce line and length to dismiss Knott, take the last two wickets and return figures of 3/12, but the other bowlers suffered; McKenzie 2/90, Thomson 1/136, Gleeson 2/92 and Jenner 1/86. Rod Marsh had been brought in as wicket-keeper because of his superior batting skills and took four catches, but dropped three as he fumbled the ball and was dubbed \"Iron Gloves\" by the press.p123, Freddi England overtook the Australian total to finish with 464, the third highest Test innings without a century at the time,\"Highest Innings Totals not to Include a Century \", Cricketarchive.com to give them a lead of 31 runs. The Australian selector Neil Harvey commented that Ray Illingworth \"gave up any thought of going for a win when he lost the toss\",p87, Whitington and most of the commentators agreed.p79-87, Whitington", "Bill Lawry won the toss and to the amazement of the Australian commentators put England in to bat, later saying that he had only one spinner and did not expect the wicket to turn.p102, Whitington Ray Illingworth requested the use of a roller on the wicket before play began, but this was turned down by umpire Lou Rowan, who apologised in the lunch break when he realised his mistake.p74, Freddi Even so, Geoff Boycott and Brian Luckhurst added 171 for the first wicket when Boycott was out for 70. Luckhurst made his maiden Test century (131) despite having his thumb injured by McKenzie on 15. With the help of John Edrich (47) he took England to 243 before a second wicket fell and they finished the first day on 257/2. Their cause was helped by Rod Marsh, Ian Chappell and Keith Stackpole dropping five catches between them, three off Garth McKenzie playing on his home turf. The next day Greg Chappell caught and bowled Colin Cowdrey for 40 at 389/7 and McKenzie (4/66) wrapped up the tail to dismiss England for 397 after batting for 10 dreary hours. Greg Chappell (1/54), Walters (1/35) and Stackpole (0/33) bowled 54 eight-ball overs between them to make up for the loss of a fourth bowler.", "John Snow (4/143) gave Australia a torrid start, sending Bill Lawry and Keith Stackpole back to the pavilion with 8 runs on the board, the batsmen having already survived lbw appeals from Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever.p101, Snow Lever then had Doug Walters caught behind by Alan Knott to make it 17/3. Ian Chappell (50) and Ian Redpath saw out the day and added 88 before they were parted, but Paul Sheahan was run out for 2 and Greg Chappell came in at 107/5. In 1968 a 21-year-old Chappell had batted for Somerset, but when they played Sussex at Hove he was cracked on the head by a nasty bouncer from Snow and forced to retire hurt.p36, Gowerp115, Snow He was therefore under no illusions as to his likely reception from the fiery fast bowler in the Test arena. Redpath made his highest Test score of 171 before he was caught and bowled by Illingworth. Chappell spent 40 minutes making 1, but after tea he hit 58 runs inside an hour to bring up his maiden Test century, 108 in his first Test innings as they put on 219 for the sixth wicket.p149, Swanton, 1977 He was the eleventh Australian to make a century on his Ashes debut after Charles Bannerman, Harry Graham, Reggie Duff, Roger Hartigan, Herbie Collins, Bill Ponsford, Archie Jackson, Neil Harvey, Jim Burke and Doug Walters. He gave Brian Luckhurst a catch off Ken Shuttleworth, but \"Bill Lawry didn't go crook on me when I got back into the rooms, so I guess it didn't matter\".p106, Whitington Rod Marsh added 40 and Australia overtook England's total with seven wickets down and ended with 440, a lead of 43.", "The wicket was not quite the batsman's paradise of the previous Tests, but after bowling a couple of maidens Garth McKenzie conceded 15 runs off his third over. Brian Luckhurst kept trying to steal singles, while his partner Geoff Boycott kept sending him back and England were 100/0 at lunch. Boycott was caught hooking by John Gleeson at fine-leg for 77 out of 116, and Gleeson had Luckhurst leg before wicket for 38 at 130/2. John Edrich made 55 before Gleeson caught him off Greg Chappell, Ashley Mallett (4/40) accounted for Fletcher and D'Oliveira, had Alan Knott stumped by Marsh to reduce England from 200/2 to 219/6. Gleeson bowled Illingworth for 24 and England were 267/7 at the end of the day. John Snow (37) made runs in the morning but Gleeson (4/83) struck again, dismissing him and Underwood in successive balls. Peter Lever (36) and Bob Willis (15 not out) added 41 for the last wicket to carry England to 332, the lowest first innings total of the series so far.", "This Test was added to the series to make up for the abandoned Third Test despite the reservations of some of the England players, replacing the Victoria vs MCC tour match scheduled for 22\u201326 January 1971. After the heavy defeat at Sydney the response of the Australian press was to \"Sack the Lot!\", but the selectors kept all their failing batsman and reshuffled their limited bowling attack, dropping Garth McKenzie, their fast bowling spearhead of the 1960s who had been injured by Snow, and Ashley Mallett despite his 4/40. The fast-medium bowler Alan Thomson swopped his twelfth man position with Alan Connolly The fast-medium bowler Ross Duncan made his Test debut, as did the leg-spinning all-rounder Kerry O'Keeffe who had taken 6/69 and hit 55 not out against the tourists earlier in the season. England recalled their vice-captain Colin Cowdrey (who had been in the nets for much of the Fourth Test) to replace Keith Fletcher, who had been injured in the tour match against North New South Wales. Brian Luckhurst bruised his fingers in the same game and had retired hurt, but was declared fit to play. Australian umpire Max O'Connell was officiating in his first Test.", "England survived the day without losing a wicket, thus negating the advantage of Lawry's early declaration and adding to the criticism he received in the press. The next morning \"Froggie\" Thomson (3/110) dismissed Boycott and Edrich, John Gleeson (3/60) caught and bowled Colin Cowdrey and England were 88/3. Brian Luckhurst made a brave 109 to save the innings despite his hands being damaged again by Thomson's short-pitched bowling. He had three fingers of his right hand bound together and his left hand was in plaster, but he added 140 with Basil d'Oliveira (117). Thomson fired down six bouncers in one over against Ray Illingworth (41)p102, Snow and several more at John Snow,p280, Arnold who was bowled by Ian Chappell for 1 after a stay of 47 minutes. Knott and Snow complained about Kerry O'Keeffe's \"suspect\" bowling action and were backed by Illingworth, which did not improve their popularity with the public, and Illingworth was booed in the final Tests as a result. England were finally out after tea on the fourth day for 392, 101 runs behind Australia.", "With the Fourth Test replacing the tour match against Victoria Australia and England played back to back Test matches only two days apart, unusual at the time. Australian dropped the unfortunate Ross Duncan and brought in a tearaway young fast bowler called Dennis Lillee for his debut. Leg-spinner Kerry O'Keeffe was replaced by off-spinner Ashley Mallett on his home ground. England replaced the injured batsmen Brian Luckhurst and out of form vice-captain Colin Cowdrey with John Hampshire and Keith Fletcher, who was fit again after missing the Fifth Test.", "Fully aware that they needed to win the last Test to retain the Ashes the Australian selectors axed Bill Lawry, the first Australian captain ever to be dropped mid-series.p158-159, Arlott Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying \"Well, I suppose we all have to get around to it some day\".p208, Whitington Although the appointment of the more aggressive Ian Chappell as captain (with Ian Redpath as his vice-captain) made sense, Lawry was still a redoubtable opening batsman who averaged 40.50 in the series and many thought that his services should have been retained. Instead the veteran Victorian opener Ken Eastwood was called up for his only Test after having made 177 against New South Wales. John Gleeson, Ashley Mallett and Ross Duncan were all dropped and replaced by debutant Tony Dell, a left-arm fast medium bowler, and the leg-spinners Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner. The selectors made another mistake in not recalling Garth McKenzie to partner his Western Australia team-mate Dennis Lillee after he had broken Geoff Boycott's arm on the same ground in a one-day match. McKenzie could have been a real handful for the England batsmen, and was only two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian Test record of 248 wickets (Benaud wrote 'Bring back McKenzie' in his newspaper column).p210, Whitington This meant Australia's four-man bowling attack had only 6 Test wickets to their name, the least since Wellington in 1945\u201346 when seven players made their debut after the war. Boycott was, of course, unfit to play and Brian Luckhurst returned to open the innings, having missed the Sixth Test because of his bruised hands. John Snow had been suffering from an inflamed sacroiliac joint, which required traction and complete rest, but he was declared fit in time for the Test.p47, Snow This was Australian umpire Lou Rowan's last Test as he retired at the end of the season and the Australian selectors Don Bradman retired after 35 years, out of which Australia had held the Ashes for all but 6 years.", "Ian Chappell won the toss and fielded on a damp wicket with slow, uneven bounce that had produced the decisive Fourth Test victory for England. The injured Brian Luckhurst took 37 minutes over his duck before was dismissed by Doug Walters (1/10) and England took an hour to reach 11/1. John Edrich (30) and Keith Fletcher (33) took the score to 60/1, but Dell (2/32) took his first Test wicket \u2013 Edrich caught by Greg Chappell \u2013 and England collapsed to 98/5 thanks to the leg-spinners Terry Jenner (3/42) and Kerry O'Keeffe (3/48), who were kept on even when the new ball became available. Ray Illingworth fought back with a solid 42 before he was bowled by Jenner, but England were all out for 184 and things were going Australia's way.", "* Brian Luckhurst and Mike Baldwin, Boot Boy to President, KOS Media, 2004"]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in Australia in 1970\u201371", "response": ["* Brian Luckhurst and Mike Baldwin, Boot Boy to President, KOS Media, 2004"]}]}}
