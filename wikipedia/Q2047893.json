It was created by Maureen Chadwick and Ann McManus of Shed Productions, who initiated the idea of developing a series primarily focusing on the inmates and staff of the fictional women's prison, Larkhall, located in the South London region. Following the success of previous series Within These Walls and the Australian-imported Prisoner: Cell Block H, both of which screened on ITV, Bad Girls was commissioned by the network and was viewed as a realistic, modern portrayal of life in a women's prison. The series featured a large ensemble cast, including Linda Henry, Claire King, Simone Lahbib, Mandana Jones, Debra Stephenson, Jack Ellis, Alicya Eyo, Helen Fraser, Kika Mirylees, Victoria Alcock, James Gaddas, Victoria Bush, Dannielle Brent and Liz May Brice.", "* Mandana Jones as Nikki Wade (Series 1\u20133)", "From the beginning, Bad Girls dealt with controversial subject matter. Early episodes of the first series included particularly shocking moments such as a pregnant prisoner miscarrying in her cell, Zandra Plackett (Lara Cazalet) being viciously strip-searched by fellow inmates for concealed drugs, and Rachel Hicks (Joanne Froggatt) committing suicide due to being bullied. The central story arc of the first three series revolved around the developing romantic relationship between Nikki Wade (Mandana Jones), a prisoner serving a life sentence for the murder of a policeman who attempted to rape her girlfriend, and Helen Stewart (Simone Lahbib), the Wing Governor who spent much of series one engaged to her boyfriend, Sean. Furthermore, the script, unwilling to compromise the realism of the programme, contained much strong language (for example, the reference to Nikki Wade as a \"rug-muncher\" and Denny Blood's (Alicya Eyo) gloating over the likelihood of Rachel Hicks having \"singed her minge\"). Other storylines to feature prominently in series one included the pregnancy of a young drug addict Zandra, who decides to use an abortion as means to be sent to an outside clinic only for her to escape and make contact with her ex-boyfriend who has no interest in her or the baby, therefore she has no choice but to return to the clinic. In fear of losing her job over Zandra's escape, Officer Lorna Rose (Luisa Bradshaw-White) asks fellow Officer Dominic McAllister (Joe Shaw) to keep quiet about the escape which leads to Zandra blackmailing Lorna to bring drugs into the prison, when Shell discovers what Zandra is up to she decides to set Lorna up; the appeal of wrongly-imprisoned Monica Lindsay (Jane Lowe) (frequently referred to as \"posh bitch\" by other characters) and the illicit relationship between Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis), the male Principal Officer and Shell Dockley (Debra Stephenson), the resident bully, Original Top Dog and drug dealer, serving life for murder."]}, {"page": "Ianto Jones", "response": ["The website Den of Geek praised Davies's writing of Ianto's death, and likened the tough story-driven decision to those used in critically acclaimed shows The Sopranos, Battlestar Galactica and The Wire. Den of Geek felt the real tension of knowing any character could die, however popular, was \"refreshing\" in comparison to impossibly death-defying characters such as 24's Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). In 2010, Davies's replacement as Doctor Who executive producer, Steven Moffat, commented saying \"I thought his death scene was brilliant.\" When the series screened in New Zealand, GayNZ compared the two contending perspectives, comparing those who viewed Ianto's death from the perspective of \"dramatic necessity\" to those who disparaged it as the result of thoughtlessness on the part of the series creators about the relative absence of representations of enduring lesbian and gay couples within television series. Ianto's death was compared to that of Tara as in the above critiques, but also contrasted to other television series where lesbian and gay couples were able to have enduring relationships, such as Six Feet Under's David Fisher (Michael C. Hall) and Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick) and Bad Girls' Nikki Wade (Mandana Jones) and Helen Stewart (Simone Lahbib)."]}, {"page": "List of Iranian actresses", "response": ["* Mandana Jones"]}, {"page": "List of British Iranians", "response": ["* Mandana Jones actress"]}, {"page": "Sylvia Hollamby", "response": ["In the first episode, she is first seen ignoring a pregnant prisoner who is suffering a miscarriage.
