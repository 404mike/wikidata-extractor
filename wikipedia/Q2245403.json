Taylor spent the rest of his time at Southampton on the bench and was sold to Fulham in November 1997."]}, {"page": "Neville Southall", "response": ["Southall applied for the vacant position, but Bobby Gould was chosen instead, who in turn named Southall and Ian Rush as his assistants. He tried Danny Coyne, Andy Marriott and Tony Roberts in goal in friendly games, but selected Southall for the World Cup qualifying wins over San Marino. A month away from his 39th birthday, he won his final cap against Turkey on 20 August 1997; the Turks won 6\u20134. Southall only played the first half as Gould blamed him for the three goals he conceded \u2013 his replacement Paul Jones went on to concede three himself in the second half. Southall's 92 Welsh caps were a national record until surpassed by Chris Gunter in November 2018. Southall conceded 126 goals, an average of 1.34 per match. The 1958 FIFA World Cup was the only time until the end of his career that Wales qualified for a major tournament and the British Home Championship was played for the final time in 1984, therefore the majority of Southall's caps came in friendlies or qualifying games."]}, {"page": "Mark Crossley", "response": ["Crossley qualified to play for Wales through a Welsh grandparent. He was a regular in the Welsh international squad, but served as understudy to Neville Southall, and then Paul Jones. He started only eight games. His full international d\u00e9but came against the Republic of Ireland. His most memorable moment with the national team was Wales' 4\u20130 win over Scotland. Prior to representing Wales, Crossley played for the England U21 team in a tournament in Toulon, France, in 1990."]}, {"page": "Antti Niemi (footballer)", "response": ["After three seasons in Edinburgh, Niemi moved to Southampton in 2002. He played for Southampton in the 2003 FA Cup final against Arsenal, which the Saints lost 1\u20130; Niemi became the first goalkeeper to be substituted in an FA Cup final when he was replaced by Paul Jones during the game due to a calf injury. In a game against Fulham in the 2002\u201303 season, he came up for a corner in injury time with Southampton trailing 2\u20131. The ball fell at his feet and he crashed a shot against the crossbar, and Michael Svensson was able to turn in the rebound, salvaging a draw. In March 2004 he saved a Michael Owen penalty to help his team to a 2\u20130 win over Liverpool. There was much speculation regarding Niemi's future at Southampton with a host of leading Premier League clubs rumoured to be interested in his services, such as Manchester United and Arsenal. After Southampton were relegated in 2005 and failed to challenge for promotion in the following season, Niemi decided to return to the Premiership with Fulham, for whom he signed in January 2006. Niemi would describe being relegated as a \"first bad experience in British football\"."]}, {"page": "Patrice Luzi", "response": ["Having previously played for AS Monaco FC and AC Ajaccio, Luzi made his only appearance for Liverpool in January 2004 against Chelsea in a 1\u20130 win. His chances were limited when Liverpool brought in Southampton's Paul Jones on loan to cover Jerzy Dudek and Chris Kirkland."]}, {"page": "Dave Beasant", "response": ["For the 1996\u201397 season, Graeme Souness was appointed manager; initially, Souness kept faith with Beasant but after a series of injuries (during which Saints took Chris Woods on loan), Souness signed Maik Taylor from Barnet in January. Beasant's final first-team game for Southampton was a 1\u20130 defeat against Liverpool on 29 December 1996. Following the arrival of Paul Jones in the summer of 1997, Beasant was now only third-choice 'keeper, and after a loan move to Nottingham Forest in August 1997, the transfer was made permanent in November. In his four years at The Dell, he made a total of 105 appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Michael Oakes", "response": ["However, the fortunes of the two keepers turned in August 2003, when Murray sustained a back injury, and Oakes stepped into the breach for Wanderers' inaugural Premier League campaign. He performed admirably in what was a tough season, but was controversially replaced by new signing Paul Jones in January 2004."]}, {"page": "Darryl Flahavan", "response": ["Flahavan began his career at Southampton, after a number of times as an unused substitute in the Premier League, Flahavan couldn't break into the first team at his hometown club, with him competing with goalkeepers such as Paul Jones, Dave Beasant and Maik Taylor. He left Saints on a free transfer in 1998, and went on to make his name with Conference side Woking."]}, {"page": "Neil Moss (footballer)", "response": ["Moss started his career at AFC Bournemouth as a trainee in May 1992 and signed his first professional contract with the club in January 1993. He moved to Southampton in December 1995 for a fee of \u00a3250,000, where he proved to be a reliable, steady goalkeeper but was unable to  displace Paul Jones or Antti Niemi as first choice goalkeeper. After only making 22 starts in eight years, he returned to Bournemouth in February 2003."]}, {"page": "Jake Cole", "response": ["Cole was born in Hammersmith, London. He was the second choice goalkeeper at Queens Park Rangers for a number of years, being understudy to Nick Culkin, Chris Day, Paul Jones, Simon Royce and Lee Camp, but was praised by John Gregory as being a model professional. He played for Hayes, AFC Wimbledon, Farnborough Town, Oxford United and Barnet on loan during his six years there. Towards the end of the 2006\u201307 season he became first choice goalkeeper after Lee Camp was recalled from his loan spell to Derby County."]}]}}
