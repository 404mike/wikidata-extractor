His name means \"tonsured one of (Saint) Peter\".Professor Dauvit Broun of the University of Glasgow identifies his father as a man called Loren. Little is known of him except that, in 1094, he is said to have killed King Duncan II of Scotland, suggesting he was an associate of Donald III of Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duncan II of Scotland", "response": ["Sending away his support troops soon backfired. The Lowland rebels seem to have ceased their activities, but Donald had spent the intervening months rebuilding his army and political support. In November 1094, Donald led his army to the Lowlands and confronted his nephew. On 12 November, Duncan was ambushed and killed in battle, having reigned for less than seven months. Primary sources are unclear about the exact manner of his death. The Annals of Inisfallen report that \"Donnchadh [Duncan] son of Mael Coluim [Malcolm], king of Alba, was slain by Domnall [Donald], son of Donnchadh [Duncan]. That same Domnall, moreover, afterwards took the kingship of Alba.\" The Annals of Ulster report that \"Donnchad son of Mael Coluim, king of Scotland, was treacherously killed by his own brothers Domnall and Edmond\". As Duncan had no brothers by those names, the text probably points to his uncle Donald and half-brother Edmund, though later texts identify a noble by the name of M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns (Malpeder) as the actual murderer.Annals of Inisfallen, AI1094.4. Online translation, published by the Corpus of Electronic Texts."]}, {"page": "Edgar, King of Scotland", "response": ["Edgar claimed the kingship in early 1095, following the murder of his half-brother Duncan II in late 1094 by M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns, a supporter of Edgar's uncle Donald III. His older brother Edmund sided with Donald, presumably in return for an appanage and acknowledgement as the heir of the aged and son-less Donald.Oram, pp. 44\u201345.", "Benjamin Hudson dismisses the story as \"completely false\". But its existence points to the circulation of \"incorrect\" tales about the monarchs of the late 11th century.Hudson, p. 119. Verses of The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n allude to the murder of another Scottish king: \"Alas a king will take sovereignty for four nights and one month; I think it is grievous that the Gaels will boast, woe to him who celebrates him. ... A son of the woman of the English... I think it is wretched, that his brother will kill him.\"Hudson, p. 92. The English woman is obviously Saint Margaret, the Anglo-Saxon consort of Malcolm III. But none of her children, male or female, are known to have been killed by one of their own siblings. The confusion probably derives from the murder of their half-sibling Duncan II of Scotland, son of Malcolm III and his first wife Ingibiorg Finnsdottir.Hudson, p. 119. A note in the Annals of Ulster claims that Duncan II was murdered by his brothers Donmall [Donald] and Edmund. As Duncan had no brothers by these names, the text probably points to his uncle Donald III and half-brother Edmund of Scotland, though later texts identify a noble by the name of M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns as the actual murderer.Hudson, p. 92."]}, {"page": "Mearns", "response": ["*M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1090\u20131099", "response": ["|Mormaer of Mearns||M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns|| || ||fl. 1094"]}, {"page": "William fitz Duncan", "response": ["In 1094, his father King Duncan II was killed by Mormaer M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns, supporting the claims of King Domnall (Donald) III B\u00e1n. It is probable that his mother Ethelreda took the infant William and fled Scotland to the safety of Allerdale in Cumberland where her brother Waltheof of Allerdale was lord. William, an only child, grew up there among his cousins.

With M\u00e1el Coluim and Edward dead in the same battle, and his other sons in Scotland still young, Domnall was made king. However, Donnchad II, M\u00e1el Coluim's eldest son by his first wife, obtained some support from William Rufus and took the throne. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle his English and French followers were massacred,Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, MS. E, s.a. 1093; A. O. Anderson (1908), p. 118. and Donnchad II himself was killed later in the same year (1094) by Domnall's ally M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns. In 1097, William Rufus sent another of M\u00e1el Coluim's sons, Edgar, to take the kingship. The ensuing death of Domnall B\u00e1n secured the kingship for Edgar, and there followed a period of relative peace. The reigns of both Edgar and his successor Alexander are obscure by comparison with their successors. The former's most notable act was to send a camel (or perhaps an elephant) to his fellow Gael Muircheartach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland.Annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 1105\u20131107/7.
