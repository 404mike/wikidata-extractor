White had a 3\u20130 advantage, producing a break of 73, a 51 clearance and a 30 break in the third frame. Williams spoke to referee Paul Collier to suggest that the table's top cushion had too much bounce and White concurred. Both players agreed to have an early mid-session interval as table fitters took 25 minutes to correct the table's mechanics. Williams clinched the next three frames with a trio of half-centuries to tie the match at 3\u20133. White and Williams shared the following four frames to force a final frame decider that White won. The WPBSA issued a statement that examination of the table confirmed that there was no change in playing conditions and stated it would investigate whether static in the arena affected it.
