The imagery of the \"Celtic World\" also inspired English and Lowland Scots poets such as Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley and Scott. In particular the Druids inspired fascination for outsiders, as English and French antiquarians, such as William Stukeley, John Aubrey, Th\u00e9ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne and Jacques Cambry, began to associate ancient megaliths and dolmens with the Druids.The current of neo-Druidism, deriving from the writings of the likes of William Stukeley and Iolo Morganwag, had its origins more in the milieu of freemasonry than any lineal connection to the ancient Celtic Druids and their culture, which survived latest in the Gaelic world with the fil\u00ed and seancha\u00ed (existing alongside Christianity). Thus neo-paganism had a very limited appeal to most people in Celtic nations, instead being largely English and Welsh based. English-based quasi-masonic groups such as the Ancient Order of Druids provided the inspiration for Iolo's Gorsedd. Later masonic groups and writers such as Godfrey Higgins and then Robert Wentworth Little's Ancient and Archaeological Order of Druids, were English founded or based."]}, {"page": "The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors", "response": ["Graves, often citing Anacalypsis and other works by Godfrey Higgins (1772\u20131833) as his source, asserts in the book that many messiah-like \"saviors\" were crucified on a cross or tree before ascending into heaven."]}, {"page": "Christ myth theory", "response": ["In his two-volume, 867-page book Anacalypsis (1836), English gentleman Godfrey Higgins said that \"the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines\", and that Christian editors \"either from roguery or folly, corrupted them all\".

However, it continues to include references to Atlantis. Notions about extraterrestrial influence on the Maya can be traced to the book Chariots of the Gods? by Erich von D\u00e4niken, whose ancient astronaut theories were in turn influenced by the work of Peter Kolosimo and especially the team of Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels, authors of Le Matin des magiciens. These latter writers were inspired by the fantasy literature of H. P. LovecraftColavito 2005 and publications by Charles Fort.  However, there remain elements of fascination with lost continents and lost civilizations, especially as popularized by 19th century science fiction and speculative fiction by authors such as Jules Verne, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and H. Rider Haggard.", "In the early nineteenth century, Alexander von Humboldt and Lord Kingsborough contributed further to such speculation. Humboldt and Kingsborough were in turn cited by Godfrey Higgins, whose Anacalypsis (1833) contributed to the emergence of perennial philosophy and claims that all religions had a common, ancient origin in a Golden Age of the distant past.Hoopes 2011aHoopes 2011b"]}, {"page": "Race and appearance of Jesus", "response": ["In his book Anacalypsis (1836), Godfrey Higgins suggested that Jesus was a dark, brown-skinned Indo-Aryan from North India.

The first five of the eight chapters in Boudet's 1886 book consists of an argument that ancient languages such as Basque, Celtic, Punic and Hebrew are derived from a more ancient mother language that was identical to Modern English. For example, when Boudet referred to the location known as The Reals\u00e8s (today called \"la Realsesse\") he claimed it was derived from two English words: real (i.e., effective), and cess (tax),Putnam and Wood, page 234. when commenting how \"The Reals\u00e8s runs in a valley whose fertile earth enables the inhabitants to pay their taxes and where the Celts till their ground for easy produce\".Boudet, La Vraie langue celtique, page 227.
