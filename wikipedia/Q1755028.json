Irene and Summer Bay later reunited after Josh West (Daniel Collopy) turned up in town and became mayor, with the intention of starting developments and constructions in Summer Bay. In 2006, Irene was shocked when Josh was found dead and Tasha became a top suspect. Through a series of events, Tasha was proven innocent. Irene tried starting a relationship with Barry Hyde (Ivar Kants), but Morag later exposed him as Josh's killer and the killer of his own wife, Kerry. Irene couldn't believe Barry had murdered two people, and broke up with him.

This proved a headache for the selectors who had already shuffled the previous year's crews considerably, in the wake of Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell's disappointing 4th place in the pair in Milan. Until the trials Pinsent and Cracknell had been training in a four with Steve Williams and Josh West, but following the unexpected trials result replaced West with Partridge. Hodge remained in the Eight. However, following the World Cup in Lucerne, Partridge was diagnosed with a collapsed lung and had to withdraw from the Athens Olympics; he was replaced in the coxless four by Ed Coode, and the crew went on to win the Olympic final beating the Canadian 4- by just 0.08 seconds.
