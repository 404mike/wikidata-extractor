Bowyer was educated at Woodroffe School, Lyme Regis and Imperial College London.\nIn 1977 he joined the Mathematics Department at the University of Bath. Shortly after that he received a doctorate from Imperial College London for research in friction-induced vibration. Whilst working in the Mathematics Department he invented (at the same time as David Watson) the algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams that bears their names (the Bowyer\u2013Watson algorithm).\n\nHe then spent twenty-two years as a lecturer then senior lecturer in the  Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Bath.  He retired from academic life in 2012, though he is still a director of the company RepRap Ltd He invented the RepRap Project \u2013 an open-source 3D printer that can produce plastic parts, including all such parts for a copy of itself. The Guardian said of this, \"[RepRap] has been called the invention that will bring down global capitalism, start a second industrial revolution and save the environment...\"In 2017 Bowyer received the 3D Printing Industry Outstanding Contribution to 3D Printing Award  and was inducted into the TCT Hall of Fame. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to 3D Printing.\nHis wife is a retired school teacher; they have one adult daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian", "response": ["*Adrian Bowyer (born 1952), Engineer, creator of the RepRap project"]}, {"page": "3D printing", "response": ["Liquid additive manufacturing (LAM) is a 3D printing technique which deposits a liquid or high viscose material (e.g. Liquid Silicone Rubber) onto a build surface to create an object which then is vulcanised using heat to harden the object.
