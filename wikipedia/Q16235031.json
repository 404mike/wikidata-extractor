He missed the first two matches of the new season after being suspensed over his involvement in an incident against Brentford on the last game of the previous season. He made his first appearance of the season on 20 August, where he started the whole game of a 2\u20131 win over Barnsley. However, Whitehead struggled in the first-team under David Wagner, due to strong competition from other midfielders. He captained the side for the first time this season, in a 2\u20131 win over Rotherham United on 27 September. Due to Hudson's absence, Whitehead often stood in as captain, though Tommy Smith was another stand-in captain when Whitehead was not included in the starting eleven. Throughout the January transfer window, he stayed at the Kirklees Stadium after being linked with a move to Wigan Athletic. However, in a 1\u20130 loss against Burton Albion on 1 April, he was sent\u2013off for a second bookable offence. Whitehead later featured three times as an unused substitute in the Championship play\u2013offs, as he was part of the squad that saw Huddersfield side promoted to the Premier League after beating Reading 5\u20134 in penalty shoot\u2013out after a 0\u20130 draw in the EFL Championship play-off final. By the end of the 2016\u201317 season, he went on to make twenty appearances in all competitions.", "Growing up, Whitehead was raised in a football-loving family and supported Liverpool. He has a brother, Craig. During his time at Huddersfield Town, he was known as 'Whitesey' by his teammate Tommy Smith, who gave him a nickname."]}, {"page": "Lee Peltier", "response": ["On 23 June 2014, Peltier left Leeds United, after reaching a mutual agreement with the club to cancel the last year of his contract. Despite interest from Forest, Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers, on the same day, Peltier rejoined former club Huddersfield Town on a three-year deal. He took the number 37 shirt which he wore during his loan spell at Nottingham Forest at the end of the previous season. On 7 August, he was named as the new club captain by manager Mark Robins, replacing Peter Clarke, who left at the end of the previous season. He made his second debut for the Terriers in their 4\u20130 defeat by Bournemouth on 9 August. However, following the dismissal of Robins, Peltier fell out of favour under new manager Chris Powell who preferred Tommy Smith. On 16 October, he was relieved of his duties as captain by Powell, being replaced by new signing Mark Hudson. He made only four further appearances under Powell, ending his second spell with Huddersfield having made 12 appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Tommy Smith", "response": ["Tommy Smith or Tommie Smith may refer to:", "* Tommy Smith (baseball) (born 1948), American baseball outfielder", "* Tommy Smith (basketball) (born 1980), American basketball player", "* Tommy Smith (ice hockey) (1886\u20131966), Canadian ice hockey forward", "* Tommy Smith (jockey) (1937\u20132013), American jockey", "* Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945) (1945\u20132019), English former international footballer, spent much of his career with Liverpool", "* Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1959), English former footballer", "* Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1980), English former footballer, most notably for Watford", "* Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1990), New Zealand international footballer for Colchester United", "* Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1992), English footballer for Stoke City", "* Tommy Smith (footballer, born 2001), English footballer for Ipswich Town", "* Tommy Smith (rugby union), 1978 rugby union winger for the USA national rugby squad, the American Cougars", "* Tommy Smith (racing driver) (born 2002), Australian racing driver", "* Tommy Smith (playwright), American playwright", "* Tommy Smith (DJ) (born 1954), radio disc jockey from Little Rock, Arkansas", "* Tommy Smith (saxophonist) (born 1967), Scottish jazz saxophonist, composer and educator"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Hogg", "response": ["On 9 August 2017, manager David Wagner appointed Tommy Smith as the club captain with Hogg and German defender Christopher Schindler as his deputies."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Tommy Smith"]}, {"page": "Tommy Smith (footballer born 1992)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1992)"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Tommy Smith"]}, {"page": "Jordy Hiwula", "response": ["On 17 July 2015, Hiwula signed for Championship side Huddersfield Town on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
