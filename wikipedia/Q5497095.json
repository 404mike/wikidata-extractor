Reynolds had been sceptical of the quality of Richard of Cirencester's information, but did not express any doubts about Bertram or the validity of the manuscript. Another tack of latter reviewers was to downplay the magnitude of the earlier acceptance and reliance on the Description. In 1866 and 1867, B.B. Woodward, the librarian of Windsor Castle, wrote a series of articles for the Gentleman's Magazine that challenged the validity of the text. However, his characterisation of The Description of Britain as \"plainly a clumsy forgery by an unpractised hand\" is unfair.

Isaac D'Israeli wrote a strongly worded letter condemning this spelling as a \"barbaric curt shock\". There followed a lengthy correspondence, mainly between John Bruce, who insisted on \"Shakspere\" because \"a man's own mode of spelling his own name ought to be followed\" and John William Burgon, who argued that \"names are to be spelt as they are spelt in the printed books of the majority of well-educated persons\", insisting that this rule authorised the spelling \"Shakspeare\".
