During his career with Leeds, Madeley played in a variety of different playing positions which led to him being described as a Utility player. Madeley made more than 500 appearances for Leeds in the Football League and appeared in 24 internationals for England between 1971 and 1977.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 20", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Paul Madeley, English footballer (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "2018", "response": ["** Paul Madeley, English footballer (b. 1944)"]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["The 1962\u201363 season was the beginning of a new era for Leeds United as Revie began to mould the team and the club into his own liking. In a game against Swansea Town in September, Revie dropped many senior players and played Charlton in a young new defensive line-up: Gary Sprake (goalkeeper), Paul Reaney (right-back), Norman Hunter and Charlton (centre-back), and Rod Johnson (left-back). With the exception of Johnson, this defensive line-up would remain consistent for much of the rest of the decade. Charlton took charge of the defence that day, and insisted upon a zonal marking system; Revie agreed to allow Charlton to become the key organiser in defence. Aided by new midfield signing Johnny Giles, Leeds put in a strong promotion challenge and finished fifth, before securing promotion as champions in the 1963\u201364 campaign, topping the table two points ahead of Sunderland. Other players that began to make their mark on the first team included Billy Bremner, Paul Madeley and Peter Lorimer."]}, {"page": "Beeston, Leeds", "response": ["Former England and Leeds United footballer Paul Madeley was born in Beeston."]}, {"page": "Gordon McQueen", "response": ["McQueen was a goalkeeper as a schoolboy but later switched to centre-back. He was signed at the age of 18 by St Mirren. He soon had scouts from other clubs monitoring his progress and it was Leeds United who finally offered \u00a330,000 in the 1972 close season, seeing him as a long-term replacement for the ageing Jack Charlton. Charlton played for some of the 1972\u201373 season but had decided to retire as the season was drawing to a close. McQueen played on six occasions in his first season at Leeds but missed out on the 1973 FA Cup Final, with manager Don Revie instead opting for the experience of utility player Paul Madeley."]}, {"page": "Terry Cooper (footballer, born 1944)", "response": ["In 1969, Leeds won the League championship with Cooper making his contribution.  Revie did not buy a reserve left back but instead used the utility player Paul Madeley to replace Cooper in the event of injury or suspension.  He was given his debut for England by Alf Ramsey against France the same year, and England won 5\u20130 with Cooper putting on a classy individual showing."]}, {"page": "Rawdon, West Yorkshire", "response": ["* Leeds United utility man Paul Madeley lived in Rawdon."]}, {"page": "Peter Storey", "response": ["Storey made his England debut under Alf Ramsey on 21 April 1971, in a 3\u20130 win over Greece at Wembley in a qualifying game for UEFA Euro 1972. Despite at the time being used as a midfielder at club level he played at right-back as Ramsey wanted to assess his options at the full-back position; his rivals for the number 2 shirt were Keith Newton (Everton), Emlyn Hughes (Liverpool), Paul Reaney (Leeds United), Chris Lawler (Liverpool), and Paul Madeley (Leeds United). He almost did not play the game as Arsenal manager Bertie Mee ordered both Storey and teammate Bob McNab to pull out of the fixture to play a league game against Burnley the day before, but was allowed to play for England after coach Don Howe persuaded Mee to reconsider his decision. Storey picked up an assist in the match after providing the cross for Francis Lee's late header. His second cap came in a 1\u20130 British Home Championship win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park, in which he played in midfield and man-marked George Best.", "He made his final appearance for England in a 2\u20130 friendly defeat to Italy in Turin on 14 June 1973. He was on the bench for the crucial final game of qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, with Colin Bell favoured in midfield with Paul Madeley and Emlyn Hughes at full-back, as England drew 1\u20131 and failed to qualify for the tournament. He did though feature in one game for The Football League XI in a 5\u20130 win over Scottish Football League XI at Maine Road on 20 March 1974, having already featured for The Football League XI in a 2\u20131 win over the League of Ireland XI in Dublin on 22 September 1971."]}]}}
