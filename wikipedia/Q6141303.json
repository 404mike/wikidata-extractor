However, the presence of Steve Rhodes in the side meant that his first-team opportunities were limited apart from a small number of games in 2000 and 2001 when both played, Pipe appearing as a specialist batsman. He did, however, make eight dismissals in a single one-day innings against Hertfordshire in 2001; this set up a county record.\nPipe had a longer run in the first XI when Rhodes was injured in the latter part of the 2003 season, and against Hampshire in early September made his first century, scoring an unbeaten 104. When Rhodes retired from playing at the end of the following season, Pipe became Worcestershire's first choice, taking 42 catches, but lost his place to Steven Davies later in the summer.\nHe left for Derbyshire for the 2006 season, and did a good job in his first season at Derbyshire, averaging over 30 with the bat and taking 39 catches and 6 stumpings; he also scored three half-centuries, before suffering a serious injury which ended his season.\nHe completed a degree in Physiotherapy at the University of Salford in 2008. In 2009 it was announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season to become Derbyshire's new physiotherapist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  James Pipe", "Worcestershire got off to a good start on the final day, Stephen Moore and Solanki making 85 for the fourth wicket after Jason Gillespie shook the top order early on.
