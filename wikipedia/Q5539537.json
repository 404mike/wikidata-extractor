Several editions were published in his lifetime, and others since. In 1860, Townsend also published a revised edition of The Arabian Nights. \nIn 1872, Townsend published, under the auspices of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, a volume entitled 'The Sea Kings of the Mediterranean'. This is an account of the Knights of Malta, from their beginnings up to Townsend's own time. The dedication is addressed to his 'Dear Boys', 'in the hope that they will hate all that is low and base, and love all that is noble, great and good.'\nTownsend also published 'The Town and Borough of Leominster' (Leominster: S. Partridge, and London: Arthur Hall & Co., date not given), written about 1861 while he was vicar of Leominster in Herefordshire.\nHis son was surgeon Stephen Townsend.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Parable", "response": ["A parable often involves a character who faces a moral dilemma or one who makes a bad decision and then suffers the unintended consequences.

There the hawk's reply to the nightingale's plea to let it go in preference for larger prey, since it is too small to satisfy the hawk's appetite, echoes Plutarch's comment in the course of quite another anecdote: 'He is a fool who leaves things close at hand to follow what is out of reach'.Of Garrulity Loeb translation, p.415 The shift of focus, from the predator's conduct towards its victim in the original telling to its reason for rejecting the victim's appeal for mercy in the later version, radically alters the fable's interpretation. Where the reader's sympathy for the nightingale was appealed to by Hesiod, it is now the hawk whose behaviour is approved, even by so liberal a commentator as Samuel Croxall.

Though the book was intriguing to Japanese readers who then had very little knowledge of Arabic culture or the Middle East in general, the Nights did not gain popularity in Japan until a more Japanified translation, entitled Zensekai Ichidai Kisho (The Most Curious Book in the Whole World), was produced by Inoue Tsutomu in 1888. His translation exerted a great influence on the literature of the Meiji, Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa periods, with writers and poets such as Hinatsu K\u014dnosuke, Hakush\u016b Kitahara and Mokutaro Kinoshita citing the work as an influence on their own works.
