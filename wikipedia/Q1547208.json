(It merged with two other organisations to form Fine Gael in 1933.)Ruth Dudley Edwards and Bridget Hourican, An Atlas of Irish History, Routledge, 2005, , pp. 97\u201398. Anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in members continued to boycott the D\u00e1il. At a special Ard Fheis in March 1926, de Valera proposed that elected members be allowed to take their seats in the D\u00e1il if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed. When his motion was defeated, de Valera resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in; on 16 May 1926, he founded his own party, Fianna F\u00e1il, which was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within its political structures. He took most Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la (TDs) with him.Tim Pat Coogan, The IRA, pp. 77\u201378.

Vice-President and de facto leader Mary MacSwiney announced that the party simply did not have the funds to contest the second election called that year, declaring \"no true Irish citizen can vote for any of the other parties\". Fianna F\u00e1il came to power at the 1932 general election (to begin what would be an unbroken 16-year spell in government) and went on to long dominate politics in the independent Irish state."]}, {"page": "Fianna \u00c9ireann", "response": ["The 1936 Fianna Convention reported that there were 18 sluaithe in the organisation. The IRA, Cumann na mBan and the Fianna were once again outlawed in June of that year. In 1938 an advisory body of prominent republicans was set up to help re-organize the fledgling organization; included were George Plunkett, Brian O'Higgins, Mary MacSwiney and Madge Daly. The following year, Joe Atkinson of Belfast was appointed as a national organiser and travelled about the country on a bicycle, contacting failed Fianna sluaithe and creating new ones. Later that year he was appointed Adjutant General and Liam Nolan of Kerry became National Organiser. George Plunkett resigned as Chief Scout for health reasons. In 1940, 150 Fianna marched in Dublin on the eve of the executions of two republicans responsible for a fatal bombing in Coventry, Barnes and McCormack in Britain. Fianna in Dublin were under the control of Jack Rowan, Kevin Hudson and Mattie O'Neill. Four sluaithe were reported active in Dublin and although the use of Hardwicke Hall was lost, newly released internees helped in the re-organization, including Wattie Bell, Noel and Des Goulding, Paddy Dillon and Mattie Carey."]}, {"page": "Second D\u00e1il", "response": ["In 1925 an [anti-Treaty] IRA convention withdrew its allegiance from the republican government to its own Army Council. Second D\u00e1il TDs had taken an oath of fidelity to the Irish Republic, and Sinn F\u00e9in regarded those who implicitly or explicitly endorsed the Treaty or Free State constitution as having violated this oath and thereby vacated their seats. In 1926 de Valera founded Fianna F\u00e1il to take a more pragmatic opposition than Sinn F\u00e9in to the Free State, and the following year the party abandoned abstentionism by entering the Free State D\u00e1il. Fianna F\u00e1il TD Se\u00e1n Lemass famously described it in March 1928 as \"a slightly constitutional party\". De Valera came to power in 1932 and in 1937 proposed a new Constitution which was adopted by plebiscite, removing to his own satisfaction any remaining reservations about the state's legitimacy. In December 1938, seven of those elected in 1921 who continued to regard the Second D\u00e1il as the last legitimate D\u00e1il assembly, and that all other surviving members had disqualified themselves by taking the oath of allegiance, gathered at a meeting with the IRA Army Council under Se\u00e1n Russell, and signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council until such a time as a new D\u00e1il could once again be democratically elected by all the people of Ireland in all 32 counties.The seven were John J. O'Kelly, George Noble Plunkett, William Stockley, Mary MacSwiney, Brian O'Higgins, Tom Maguire and Cathal \u00d3 Murchadha. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic. Official Sinn F\u00e9in in 1969\u201370 and Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in in 1986 abandoned abstentionism and began a gradual  recognition of the legitimacy of the modern Irish state; the smaller Republican Sinn F\u00e9in retains the view that the Second D\u00e1il was the last legitimate Irish legislature."]}, {"page": "Terence MacSwiney", "response": ["In Ireland MacSwiney's sister Mary MacSwiney took on his seat in the D\u00e1il and spoke against the Anglo-Irish Treaty in January 1922.
