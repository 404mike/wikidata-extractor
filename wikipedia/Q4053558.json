He has also released material under various pseudonyms including Maddslinky and is half of the Phuturistix duo.Bias is best known for his single \"Neighbourhood\" which reached #25 in the UK charts in July 2000, having created a large underground response from late 1999 in its original version. Living in Milton Keynes at the time, he collaborated with several other local artists and DJs resulting in a host of well-received tracks and remixes early in his producing career, such as \"Standard Hoodlum Issue\" with DJ Spatts (The Criminal Minds). Some of these have been released on his own Sidewinder/Sidestepper and Biasonic labels.Bias started to record under the Maddslinky name in 2001, resulting in the album \"Make Your Peace\" in 2003 and a second \"Make A Change\" in 2010. Around the same time, he also became one half of the production duo Phuturistix and has been engaged in remixing duties for many well-known artists.\nBias' releases, which explore a more experimental or progressive side of the 2-step garage sound, have been hailed as a crucial element in the establishment of dubstep as a definable sound or genre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zed", "response": ["*Zed Bias (born 1969), English musician"]}, {"page": "Locked On Records", "response": ["Locked On Records is a British record label, concentrating on UK garage and grime music.

The line up of residents has changed over the years to include Youngsta, Hatcha, Geeneus, and Plastician, with Crazy D as MC/host. Producers including D1, Skream and Benga make regular appearances.Another crucial element in the early development of dubstep was the Big Apple Records record shop in Croydon. Key artists such as Hatcha and later Skream worked in the shop (which initially sold early UK Hardcore / Rave, Techno and House and later, garage and drum and bass, but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area), while Digital Mystikz were frequent visitors.

Moving away from the more soulful elements of garage, it incorporated downtempo drum and bass style basslines, trading the shuffle of 2-step for a more straightforward breakbeat drum pattern. The breakthrough for this style came in 1999 from DJ Dee Kline's \"I Don't Smoke\" selling 15,000 units on Rat Records, until eventually being licensed to EastWest in 2000 and climbing to number 11 in the UK Singles Chart. Following this came DJ Zinc's \"138 Trek\", an experiment with drum and bass production at UK garage tempo (138 bpm). This instigated a dialog between breaks and garage producers, with Forward>> (a club night at Plastic People, London) playing host to Zed Bias and Oris Jay (a.k.a. Darqwan).
