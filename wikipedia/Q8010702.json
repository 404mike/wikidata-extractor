Henry James Clayton and Mabel Sarah Clayton. He was an English writer of fictional spy thrillers set in the 1960s through the 1980s, or, as the writer H. R. F. Keating called them, \"action novels of international power.\"  Like C. P. Snow, he was a quintessentially British Establishment figure who had been a civil servant in India, and his books vigorously put forth his perhaps idiosyncratic points of view.  The principle character in most of his novels is the urbane Colonel Charles Russell of the fictional Security Executive, (clearly based on the actual MI5 or Security Service), who moves easily and gracefully along Snow's Corridors of Power in Whitehall. During the years of the fictional spy mania initially begun by the James Bond stories, Haggard was considered by most critics to be at the very top of the field.\nKeating, however, also observes that \"...the books were fore-runners in a trend that was noticeable in both British and American crime writing from the late 1960's onwards, a turning of the tide to flow to the right.  After the revolution carried out in the late 1930s by Eric Ambler in the espionage field... a revolution which swung crime writing generally to the left... there had been little change.  With the Haggard books the first signs of a silent swing began to show.\"\nWriting about his fiction, Haggard himself said: My novels are chiefly novels of suspense with a background of international politics. A Colonel Charles Russell of the Security Executive, a not entirely imaginary British counter-espionage organization, while not a protagonist in the technical sense, holds the story line together in the background by his operations, while the characters in the foreground carry the action.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Russell", "response": ["* Colonel Charles Michael Russell, fictional character of William Haggard"]}, {"page": "List of gentlemen's clubs in London", "response": ["* Bratt's Club \u2013 John Beaver's club in A Handful of Dust by Evelyn Waugh; Charles Ryder\u2019s club in \u201c Brideshead Revisited\u201d by Evelyn Waugh; Colonel Charles Russell's club in two of the first three novels by William Haggard."]}, {"page": "Arena (disambiguation)", "response": ["* The Arena (novel), a 1962 suspense novel by William Haggard"]}, {"page": "Gold Dagger", "response": ["** William Haggard, The High Wire"]}, {"page": "Haggard (surname)", "response": ["* William Haggard (1907\u20131993), British writer of fictional spy thrillers"]}, {"page": "Richard Henry Michael Clayton", "response": ["#REDIRECTWilliam Haggard"]}, {"page": "Haggard, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Haggard"]}, {"page": "Colonel Charles Michael Russell", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Haggard#Colonel Charles Russell series"]}, {"page": "Colonel Russell", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Haggard#Colonel Charles Russell series"]}, {"page": "Colonel Charles Russell", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Haggard#Colonel Charles Russell series"]}, {"page": "Slow Burner", "response": ["Slow Burner is a 1958 suspense novel by the British author William Haggard published in England by Cassell and in the United States by Little Brown.
