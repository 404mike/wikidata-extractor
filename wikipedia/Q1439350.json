J. \"Billy\" Smith (1893-1957) was a secretary/committee member of Aston Villa F.C. from  August 1926 to May 1934. During this time, this was the equivalent of the modern day manager's position. Before 1934, the team was selected by a committee. Smith was the last person to be a Secretary. Jimmy McMullan was appointed as manager when Billy Smith retired. Smith joined Aston Villa as a 17-year-old in 1910 and remained at the club until his death in 1957. His association with Villa lasted 47 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Ramsay", "response": ["In 1926, at the age of 71, Ramsay retired as secretary and became honorary advisor and a vice-president of the Club. His replacement W. J. Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success, although the club did finish runners-up in the league twice under his guidance. In 1934 Smith stood down and the club decided to appoint its first manager, Jimmy McMullan. The following year Ramsay died at the age of 80. Within a year of his death the Midlands giants were relegated, an unthinkable notion in the Ramsay era."]}, {"page": "List of Aston Villa F.C. managers", "response": ["This chronological list of managers of Aston Villa Football Club comprises all those who have held the position of secretary or manager of the first team of Aston Villa since the formation of the club in 1874.

Smith. The most successful person to manage the club was George Ramsay, who won six FA Cups and six First Division championships in his 42-year reign as secretary.
