Wheeler had similar musical abilities, becoming a founder member of the Guild of Gentlemen Trumpeters. After completing his National Service with the RAF in 1948, Wheeler's consuming interest in Mahler and the championing of the unfinished Tenth by fellow enthusiast Jack Diether in the United States led him to begin work on the score, unaware that another musicologist, Deryck Cooke, was tackling the same project.Although Cooke's performing version is by far the most familiar, many (including fellow 'completer' Remo Mazzetti Jr.) regard Wheeler's version as closest in texture to the more leanly orchestrated works Mahler was composing towards the end of his life. Unsurprisingly in Wheeler's version the brass features more heavily than in any other realisation. However what cannot be doubted is that Wheeler's is the least speculative of all versions and hence can be regarded as a snapshot of a work-in-progress rather than an attempt at a 'completion'.\nWheeler's caution led him to complete two working versions of the score, neither of which saw the light of day in performance. On 26 May 1965 Arthur Bloom premiered the first completed version of Wheeler's work with the Caecilian Symphony Orchestra. This was the third version, which he had completed in 1955. Wheeler made further changes to his work, and his final, fourth complete score was performed in New York City by Jonel Perlea with the Manhattan School of Music Orchestra in November 1966.\nWheeler's fourth revision is the basis of American conductor Robert Olson's edition, in which he corrected and deciphered some of the inconsistencies in Wheeler's manuscript.\nOlson has since recorded Wheeler's version twice: with the Colorado MahlerFest Orchestra and again with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)", "response": ["The completion by Joseph Wheeler dates from 1953 to 1965, and like Cooke he also refined his ideas several times, so the final version of 1965 was actually the fourth iteration; the American composer Remo Mazzetti Jr. considers Wheeler's fourth version to be the closest to Mahler's late orchestral style. Wheeler's interventions are at the opposite end of the spectrum to Carpenter's, and he is less interventionist even than Cooke: he only makes additions to the score where performance is otherwise impossible. The effect is sparer than other completions, although Wheeler does increase the brass part to a greater degree than Cooke."]}, {"page": "Unfinished symphony", "response": ["*Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 10, which Mahler left with a continuous draft of this five-movement work, with the first and third movements more or less fully scored. These two movements (Adagio and Purgatorio) were prepared for publication by Franz Schalk and Ernst Krenek in 1924. Various orchestrations and performing editions of the entire symphony have been made since the 1960s, including that of Deryck Cooke (1960\u201364), subsequently revised with input from Berthold Goldschmidt, Colin Matthews and David Matthews and a sparer, brass-prominent version by Joseph Wheeler."]}, {"page": "1977 in British music", "response": ["*11 October - Joseph Wheeler, musicologist, 49/50"]}, {"page": "Joseph Wheeler (disambiguation)", "response": ["Joseph Wheeler (1836\u20131906) was a Confederate States Army general.", "* Joseph Wheeler (pirate) (fl. 1696\u20131698), pirate active in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea", "* Joseph Wheeler (musicologist) (1927\u20131977), British musician and musicologist", "* Joseph Wheeler (shipbuilder), 19th-century Irish shipbuilder", "* Joseph Wheeler (sculpture), a bronze sculpture by Berthold Nebel", "* Joseph Wheeler High School, Georgia, U.S."]}]}}
