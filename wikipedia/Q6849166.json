Bringing a shared love of jazz to the British blues boom then sweeping London's clubs, the band was completed by Mike Vickers on guitar, alto saxophone and flute, bassist Dave Richmond and Paul Jones as lead vocalist and harmonicist. By this time they had changed their name to Manfred Mann & the Manfreds. Gigging throughout late 1962 and early 1963, they soon attracted attention for their distinctive sound.", "The group had managed an initial jazz/rhythm-and-blues fusion, and then had taken chart music in their stride\u2014but could not hope to cope with Paul Jones' projected solo career as singer and actor, and with Mike Vickers' orchestral and instrumental ambitions. Jones intended to go solo once a replacement could be found, but stayed with the band for another year, during which Vickers left. McGuinness moved to guitar, his original instrument, contributing the distinctive National Steel Guitar to \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" and \"Pretty Flamingo\", and was replaced on bass by Jack Bruce, who had been playing for the Graham Bond Organisation for some time before a recent brief stint with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. In his brief tenure before leaving to form Cream, Bruce played on \"Pretty Flamingo\" and on the EP Instrumental Asylum (for which he and wind instrumentalists Henry Lowther and Lyn Dobson were included in the sleeve photo of the group), which began the group's experiments with instrumental versions of chart songs. Bruce was replaced by Klaus Voormann. The band changed record companies just afterward, although EMI quickly released an EP of earlier unissued 1963\u201366 era songs titled As Was (a play on the title of their then new 1966 album, As Is), a hits compilation; Mann Made Hits (1966), an instrumental compilation LP that included one unissued instrumental track; Soul of Mann (1967); and, most controversially, used session players to complete the unfinished track \"You Gave Me Somebody To Love\" (c/w 'Poison Ivy\"\u2014both sung by Paul Jones) which made No. 36 in the UK singles chart, upsetting the group\u2014hence McGuinness's wry comment \"Manfreds disown new single\" on the sleeve of their next studio album for their new record label.", "* Mike Vickers \u2013 guitar, alto sax, flute (1962\u20131965)", " bar:MikVic   text:Mike Vickers"]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Mike Vickers (born 1940)"]}, {"page": "Abbey Road", "response": ["* Moog programming by Mike Vickers"]}, {"page": "All You Need Is Love", "response": ["*Mike Vickers \u2013 conductor"]}, {"page": "For Your Love (album)", "response": ["*Mike Vickers \u2013 guitar on \"Sweet Music\""]}, {"page": "Here Comes the Sun", "response": ["\"Here Comes the Sun\" was completed on 19 August with the addition of a Moog synthesizer part.

Once installed at EMI Studios in August 1969, where Mike Vickers of the band Manfred Mann assisted in programming the system, Harrison's Moog proved to be an important addition to the Beatles' final recording project. With Harrison, Lennon and Paul McCartney each playing the instrument, the band incorporated white noise and other Moog sound effects, together with melodic elements played via the ribbon controller.
