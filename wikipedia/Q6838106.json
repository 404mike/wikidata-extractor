He joined Coventry City F.C. as an apprentice in 1962. In January 1966, he turned professional with Coventry and soon made his first team debut. A run of poor form during the 1974-1975 season led to the exciting Graham Oakey replacing him on the back line and Coop went on loan to York City F.C. for four games. When he returned to Coventry, he regained his starting position.\nIn the summer of 1979, Coventry sent him on loan to the Detroit Express of the North American Soccer League. In July 1981, he transferred to Derby County F.C. for \u00a320,000 where he played half a season before retiring in January 1982. He later played a few games for AP Leamington. After retirement he worked as a coach at Coventry City and was an antiques dealer.\nHe and his wife live in Wellesbourne, Warwickshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1948", "response": ["** Mick Coop, English professional football right back"]}, {"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  Mick Coop 44", "|  Mick Coop 48", "|  Mick Coop 47 Tommy Hutchison 47", "|  Mick Coop", "|  Mick Coop || 492 || 22"]}, {"page": "Terry Yorath", "response": ["Yorath would be captain to one of only a handful of top flight Coventry City sides that spent an entire season in the top ten.

Committing several players to attack left Coventry vulnerable, and Bristol City twice found themselves with the ball behind Coventry's defence. The two chances fell to Chris Garland and Jimmy Mann, but neither was able to beat Coventry goalkeeper Les Sealey. Two minutes after Mann's miss, Coventry took the lead. A free kick by Mick Coop was parried weakly by Bristol City goalkeeper John Shaw and fell to Tommy Hutchison, who scored his second goal of the season with a powerful shot. Bristol City had several chances to equalise just before half-time \u2013 first through a goal-line clearance by McDonald, then through  Trevor Tainton, whose 20-yard shot was saved by Sealey. The final Bristol City chance of the half resulted from a Coventry defensive mix-up; Yorath allowed a pass from Donnie Gillies through to Sealey, but the goalkeeper was not expecting it and the ball only narrowly missed the Coventry goal. The score remained  to Coventry at half-time.", "|6 || Mick Coop"]}]}}
