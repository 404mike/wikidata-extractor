In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the Rodrigues starling should belong in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 added support to the claim that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling. The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material. Hume noted that G\u00fcnther and Newton had not designated a holotype specimen among the fossils they based the specific name on, and chose the skull from their syntype series of bones as the lectotype; specimen NMHUK A9050, housed at the Natural History Museum, London.

In 1874 George Ernest Shelley, who had access to more specimens, realized that this bird wasn't a goshawk and moved the species into its own monotypic genus, Dryotriorchis. Dryotriorchis is a distinct genus due to its short wings, long tail, short crest, and oval nostrils. The word \"Dryo-\" is from the Greek for \"oak\" and \"triorchis\" from the Greek for \"hawk\", specifically a kind of hawk thought to have three testicles. It is believed that the genus is more closely related to Circaetus than Terathopius, and it is possibly a link between these and the Asian genus Spilornis. The syrinx morphology is distinctly like those of accipiter hawks but shows similarities to features found in Nisaetus. Two subspecies are known: the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and D. s. batesi. D. s. batesi was originally described as a separate species, Dryotriorchis batesi, by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1904 due to its unspotted breast. Sharpe named the subspecies in honor of G. L. Bates, who shipped him specimens from Cameroon. This species is also known as the West African Serpent eagle and the African Serpent-eagle.Ferguson-Lees 2001, p. 128Thiollay 1994, p. 134"]}, {"page": "Pinarocorys", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by George Ernest Shelley"]}]}}
