If \"the presence of the past\" was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th century, from James Stirling to Aldo Rossi, Robert Venturi, Oswald Matthias Ungers, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. Colin Rowe's unorthodox and non-chronological view of history then made it possible for him to develop theoretical formulations such as his famous essay \"The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa\" (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional \"rules\" in Palladio's villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar \"rules\" in Le Corbusier's villas at Poissy and Garches.The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa and Other Essays, MIT Press, Main essay reprinted in collected works volume, (1976).
