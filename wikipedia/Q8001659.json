Two goals from Doug Moran, one either side of a Crawford strike, saw the visitors secure a 3\u20131 victory.  Three days later, and in front of 24,928 spectators, the highest attendance at Portman Road that season, Ipswich won 2\u20131 against Blackburn Rovers.  A fourth consecutive victory followed as Ipswich beat Birmingham City 4\u20131 which included another brace from Phillips, one of which was a  strike.  After a mid-week League Cup victory over Manchester City, Ipswich faced Everton at Goodison Park: goalkeeper Wilf Hall stood in for injured Roy Bailey to make his debut in a First Division match.  In blustery conditions, Derek Temple scored a hat-trick as Ipswich were beaten convincingly 5\u20132 with consolation goals from Phillips and Moran. Two days later, Ipswich travelled to Ewood Park and secured a late point with a 2\u20132 draw thanks to a 75th minute goal from Phillips, his second of the match.  The ball rebounded off his face after being punched clear by Blackburn's goalkeeper Brian Reeves.  A 4\u20132 defeat by Fulham meant Ipswich had gone without a win in three games, but the final fixture of September saw them defeat Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough 4\u20131, with goals from Phillips (2), Crawford and Jimmy Leadbetter.
