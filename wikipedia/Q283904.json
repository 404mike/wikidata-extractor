It is generally regarded as the closest to the book, being set at the same time as the novel, pre-Great War, but still bears little resemblance to Buchan's original story. Its climax bore no relation to the novel's denouement, instead seeing Hannay hanging from the hands of Big Ben. The film was followed by a spin-off television series, Hannay, also starring Powell and featuring adventures occurring prior to the events in The Thirty-Nine Steps."]}, {"page": "Elsa Lanchester", "response": ["Lanchester played a witch in Bell, Book and Candle (1958), and appeared in such films as Mary Poppins (1964), in which her husband's goddaughter Karen Dotrice also starred, That Darn Cat!

Lanchester continued to make occasional film appearances, singing a duet with Elvis Presley in Easy Come, Easy Go (1967), and playing the mother in the original version of Willard (1971), alongside Bruce Davison and Ernest Borgnine, which scored well at the box office. She was Jessica Marbles, a sleuth based on Agatha Christie's Jane Marple, in the 1976 murder mystery spoof Murder by Death, and she made her last film in 1980 as Sophie in Die Laughing. She released three LP albums in the 1950s. Two (referred to above) were entitled \"Songs for a Shuttered Parlour\" and \"Songs for a Smoke-Filled Room\", and were vaguely lewd and danced around their true purpose, such as the song about her husband's \"clock\" not working. Laughton provided the spoken introductions to each number and even joined Lanchester in the singing of \"She Was Poor but She Was Honest\". Her third LP was entitled \"Cockney London\", a selection of old London songs for which Laughton wrote the sleeve-notes.
