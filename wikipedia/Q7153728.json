Among his pupils were Robert Simpson, Gordon Jacob, James Bernard, Paul Spicer, Madeleine Dring, and Imogen Holst. The post at the RCM, which from 1925 he combined with the position of Director of Music at St Paul's Girls' School, and frequent work as a competition adjudicator, was to reduce the amount of time he could devote to composition; but he continued to write orchestral and chamber music, including the string quartet In Gloucestershire (originally written 1916, but rewritten in whole or in part several times and not reaching its final form until the 1930s), the overture Merry Eye (1920) and the second Piano Concerto (1925). The first performance of the last named work occasioned a demonstration in the concert hall from a hostile critic. Howells, always over-sensitive to criticism, withdrew the work and produced few significant compositions for several years. Howells' friend and fellow composer, Martin Sumpter, encouraged this temporary hiatus from composing large scale works. One exception was Lambert's Clavichord (1928), a rare example of a composition by a 20th-century composer for that instrument. It was inspired by a clavichord lent to Howells by his friend Herbert Lambert, an instrument maker and photographer based in Bath. Several other major compositions written around this time, however, remained unperformed, notably an a capella Requiem to English words written in 1932,Until the publication of Palmer's researches, the Requiem was believed to have been composed in 1936. and a choral work, A Kent Yeoman's Wooing Song, written the following year.", "Though not an orthodox Christian, Howells was now chiefly identified with the composition of religious music. His follow-up work to the Hymnus Paradisi was an extended setting of the Latin Mass for soloists, chorus and orchestra, named Missa Sabrinensis after the River Severn and first performed in Worcester Cathedral as part of the Three Choirs Festival in 1954. It was considered a disappointment after the success of the earlier work, and its extreme complexity and difficulty has prevented it becoming widely known. The critic Michael Kennedy, however, considers it one of Howells' finest works. Howells followed it with An English Mass (1956), a smaller-scale setting to English words for chorus, strings and organ. His final large-scale choral work was the Stabat Mater, setting a text whose subsidiary theme of a parent mourning a child had obvious personal significance. He began it in 1959 but found it difficult to complete; it was not performed until 1965. The motet Take Him, Earth, For Cherishing, a posthumous tribute to President John F. Kennedy, was written in late spring of 1964.  It premiered as part of a 22 November 1964 Canadian tribute to Kennedy at Washington\u2019s National Gallery of Art sung by the Choir of St. George\u2019s Cathedral, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, under the direction of George N. Maybee. Maybee brought the St. George\u2019s choir to England in September 1965, and they performed the piece at King\u2019s College, Cambridge with Howells in attendance.

Howells maintained later in life that Ralph Vaughan Williams convinced him to allow the work to be performed publicly at the Three Choirs Festival. However, his former pupil and biographer Paul Spicer contends that Howells first showed the music to Herbert Sumsion, organist of Gloucester Cathedral, who in turn showed it to Gerald Finzi, and that only after these two expressed their enthusiasm did Howells show the music to Vaughan Williams. The title 'Hymnus Paradisi' was suggested by Sumsion. The work received its successful premiere at the Festival in 1950.Wilfrid Mellers, \"CD Reviews: Herbert Howells\" (July 1995).

Gradually more intense, the voices reach a climax on \"Holy, Holy, Holy\". After a general rest, they proclaim in unison with the organ: \"Lord God of Sabaoth\". In the middle section the soloist addresses God softly: \"Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ\". The choir joins, not only in this line, for \"O Christ\", repeating that pattern also for the following acclamations up to \"Thou didst open the Kingdom of Heav'n to all believers\", finally just inserting \"Christ\". Holden comments: \"The haunting treble solo which sets the individual against the chorus is a typically ingenious idea.\" A second climax is reached before a quiet ending.
