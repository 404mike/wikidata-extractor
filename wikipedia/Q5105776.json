Anna Smith of Empire called it \"formulaic and all-American\", commenting that many scenes \"appear functional rather than inspirational\", and that the film focused on the racial issue \"a little too heavily\". Smith stated, \"clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it\". Marc Mohan from The Oregonian stressed it can be compared to after-school specials due to its \"lack of originality in plot and character\". Time Outs Jessica Winter also drew a comparation to after-school specials, saying \"on the big screen ... its clich\u00e9s seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly\". Nick Schager of Slant Magazine lamented that the \"clich\u00e9s are too numerous to mention\", while Neil Smith from BBC asserted it has \"as much ... fantasy as Lord of the Rings\". Jan Stuart of Newsday deemed it \"virtually suspense-free\", while Robert Hanks of The Independent stated it has an important message but that is a \"shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story\". Commenting on The Times, Chris Ayres stressed that although it has good \"visual flair\" it \"is ruined by its Oprah-style emotional manipulation\". New York Posts Kyle Smith deemed it as \"uplifting but unimaginative\", suggesting that \"Akeelah and the Bee is so warm and well-meaning that you may find yourself wanting to like it more than you really do\"."]}, {"page": "Chris Ayres (journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Ayres"]}, {"page": "Princeton Tigers", "response": ["Jadwin Gym has served host to five previous EIWA Championships (1969, 1979, 1981, 1987 and 2012), as well as both the 1975 and 1981 NCAA Wrestling Championships.
