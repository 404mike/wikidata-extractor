The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and regularly appeared on The Midnight Special more than any other band in that show's history with four appearances (in 1973, 1975, 1976 and 1977).", "Bev Bevan (under an agreement with Lynne, who co-owned the ELO name with him) continued on in 1989 as ELO Part II, initially with no other former ELO members, but with ELO's main orchestra conductor, Louis Clark. Bevan also recruited Eric Troyer, Pete Haycock, and Neil Lockwood. ELO Part II released their debut album Electric Light Orchestra Part Two in May 1991. Mik Kaminski, Kelly Groucutt and Hugh McDowell, at the time working in a group called OrKestra, joined the group for their first tour in 1991. While McDowell did not stay, Groucutt and Kaminski became fully-fledged members. In 1994, after the departure of Haycock and Lockwood, the remaining five recorded Moment of Truth with their newest member, Phil Bates. This lineup toured extensively up to 1999. Bevan retired from the lineup in 1999 and sold his share of the ELO name to Jeff Lynne in 2000, after Lynne had expressed his dismay that in certain areas the band were billed as 'ELO', rather than with '...Part II' added, suggesting it was the original outfit. After Bevan left, the band continued after they changed its name to The Orchestra. In 2001 The Orchestra released their debut album No Rewind."]}, {"page": "February 19", "response": ["*2009 \u2013 Kelly Groucutt, English singer and bass player  (b. 1945)"]}, {"page": "Jeff Lynne", "response": ["Problems led to Wood's departure from ELO in 1972, after the band's eponymous first album, leaving Lynne as the band's dominant creative force. Thereafter followed a succession of band personnel changes and increasingly popular albums: ELO 2 (1973) and On the Third Day (also 1973), Eldorado (1974) and Face the Music (1975). By A New World Record (1976), Lynne had almost developed the roots of the group into a more complex and unique pop-rock sound mixed with studio strings, layered vocals, and tight, catchy pop singles. Lynne's now almost complete creative dominance as producer, songwriter, arranger, lead singer and guitarist could make ELO appear to be an almost solo effort. However, the ELO sound and the focus of Lynne's writing was also shaped by Louis Clark's and Richard Tandy's co-arranging, under Lynne's direction (especially the large string sections in addition to ELO's own string trio), and Bev Bevan's drumming, while Richard Tandy's integration of the piano, Moog, harmonium, and Mellotron, with more novel keyboard technology, gave Lynne's songs a more symphonic sound. Bassist Kelly Groucutt's distinctive voice mixed with Lynne's to produce the classic ELO harmonic vocal sound."]}, {"page": "September 8", "response": ["*  1945   \u2013 Kelly Groucutt, English bass player (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "1945 in music", "response": ["**Kelly Groucutt, rock musician (Electric Light Orchestra) (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["By January 1975, bass player Mike de Albuquerque and cellist Mike Edwards had left the band during the Eldorado's recording sessions and subsequent tour, respectively. Bass player Kelly Groucutt and classically-trained cellist Melvyn Gale both joined the band as their replacements. Following the conclusion of the Eldorado's European leg of the tour, the band began recording the new album at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. ELO had frequently opened for Deep Purple for the initial North American leg of the Eldorado Tour, and Deep Purple had recommended Musicland to ELO. This was the first time ELO recorded at Musicland and the band would later return to record most of the future albums here due to frontman Jeff Lynne's great fondness for it and his working relationship with sound engineer Mack.", "Lynne, also the band's sole songwriter, wanted to move towards more tunes that would be memorable rather than the usual progressive-rock style of the group's first three albums and straight symphonic sound of the Eldorado. New measures were taken to ensure a more-complex but satisfying sound, such as backing female vocalists of Ellie Greenwich, Susan Collins, Nancy O'Neill and Marge Raymond, a choir, and the band's string trio of Mik Kaminski, Hugh McDowell and Melvyn Gale mixed into the backing 30-piece string section and also allowing them to perform some of the solos on the records. While Lynne was the lead vocalist for a vast majority of the band's songs, Kelly Groucutt sang lead vocals on \"Poker\" and (alternating with Lynne) on \"Nightrider\", giving the tracks a dynamic sound. The backing orchestra was recorded separately from the band's initial sessions, being recorded instead at De Lane Lea Studios in London, England.", "It begins with a haunting synthesizer (provided by Richard Tandy) playing a repeating broken chord of E\u266d, A, C, A along with a backing choir. The backing orchestration is minimal, featuring small bits here and there during which a \"knocking\" sound suddenly appears and fades out before a baritone voice fades in speaking a back-masked message. Drummer, Bev Bevan provided the voice and when the record is played backwards, he exclaims \"The music is reversible but time is not. Turn back, turn back, turn back, turn back\". This inclusion was a joke by Jeff Lynne, who faced mild controversy from a Christian fundamentalist group, accusing him of including backwards Satanic messages on the track \"Eldorado\" from their previous album of the same name.Big Secrets: Chapter 26, pages 200, 203, 204, 205 & 206. 0-688-04830-7 The orchestration grows as a choir chants \"Hallelujah\" similar to the fashion of Handel's \"Messiah\". The haunting opening concludes with the backing orchestra repeating the same broken chord as the synthesizer before transitioning into a more symphonic-rock bridge accompanied by the drums. The synthesizer plays an arpeggio during which the strings play riffs. Following this, Lynne provides a guitar-solo and the strings follow after. The song suddenly shifts to a rock sound with a prominent acoustic guitar riff where Kelly Groucutt joins on the bass guitar. Kaminski, McDowell and Gale all solo together on this rock-section. The rock section is followed by another symphonic-rock bridge with another guitar solo which, again, leads into a rock section. The choir at the end of the track chants \"Fire on high\" several times, providing the song the only set of true lyrics.", "The song is a fast-tempo guitar-rocker featuring Kelly Groucutt on both lead and harmony vocals, one of few times where Jeff Lynne does not sing the lead. Bev Bevan plays fast, bombastic drum fills in between verses and Richard Tandy provides a moog synthesizer arpeggio rhythm section. The middle section of the song slows down into a slow, bluesy bridge (\"Play me another hand\") with Tandy adding in some synthesizer fillers. Lynne's harmony vocals come in on the final verse of the song.", "* Kelly Groucutt \u2013 vocals, bass, backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Poker\", co-lead vocals on \"Nightrider\""]}, {"page": "A New World Record", "response": ["* Kelly Groucutt\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar, percussion, backing vocals, lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Out of the Blue (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["*Kelly Groucutt \u2013 co-lead vocals on \"Sweet Is the Night\", backing vocals, Gibson G3 bass guitar, percussion"]}, {"page": "Discovery (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["*Kelly Groucutt \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Time (ELO album)", "response": ["*Kelly Groucutt \u2013 Bass guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Secret Messages", "response": ["Secret Messages is the tenth studio album by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), released in 1983 on Jet Records.
