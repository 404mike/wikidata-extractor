In 1994, McIntyre expressed pleasure that his theory was gaining acceptance in Australia: \"It is gradually seeping through. The important thing is that... it has been on the school syllabus, and therefore students have... read about it. They in due course become teachers and... they will then tell their students and so on\".McIntyre, K.G.

In 1889, Sir Clements Markham, an English explorer, author and geographer, pointed out that a Latin legend on the terrestrial globe, placed off the Patagonian coast, states: \"Thomas Caundish 18 Dec. 1587 h\u00e6c terra sub nostris oculis primum obtulit sub latitud 47 cujus seu admodum salubris Incol\u00e6 maturi ex parte proceri sunt gigantes et vasti magnitudinis\".\"Introduction\", Tractatus de Globis, pp. xxx.
