He was playing amateur football for Southampton when he signed professional with Plymouth Argyle in November 1947. He had previously been an unsuccessful triallist at his local side Bolton Wanderers. His league debut came in February 1948 at home to Luton Town, and he soon became a regular in the Home Park side, helping Plymouth win the Third Division South title in 1952.  Due to his speed down the wing the crowd christened him Flash Astall. That same year he was selected for the England B team. In October 1953 he was signed by Second Division rivals Birmingham City for a fee of \u00a314,000, following his Plymouth wing colleague Alex Govan to St Andrew's.

He was brought back to Plymouth Argyle early in the 1953\u201354 season in exchange for Harold Dobbie as the club sought a replacement for Alex Govan. Edds played regularly on his return, but when he lost his place in the team the following season, was allowed to join Swindon Town, having scored 22 goals in 88 league and cup appearances for Argyle.

The row at half-time had done little for second-half morale, but speaking fifty years later, Gil Merrick placed the blame less on Boyd's questionable fitness than on a failure to discuss how to stop Revie. Alex Govan, convinced that \"if Roy Warhurst had been fit then there would only have been one winner\", blamed \"bad team selection\", saying that even without Warhurst he firmly believed \"that if Badham had been in we would have won that game.
