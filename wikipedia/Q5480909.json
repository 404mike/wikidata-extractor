His family later moved to Osberton Hall, Scofton, Worksop.\nDuring his minority William Mason the poet was his guardian.He was elected M.P. for Yorkshire in a by-election in January 1784 (only 2 months prior to the General Election of 1784), High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1787\u201388, and M.P. for Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire in 1801, sitting until 1807.Foljambe first married Mary Arabella (1749-1790), second daughter (and later sole heiress) of John Thornhagh of Osberton and Sturton, Nottinghamshire and Arabella Savile. (John took the name of Hewet on succeeding to the estates of his godfather, Sir Thomas Hewet, of Shireoaks Hall, Nottinghamshire.) His second wife was Lady Mary Arabella Lumley, daughter of Richard, 4th Earl of Scarborough and Barbara, younger daughter and co-heiress of Sir George Savile, last Baronet of Rufford.\nHe died 13 November 1814. He was succeeded by his son George, who adopted the additional surname of Savile.

After unsuccessfully approaching Francis Ferrand Foljambe, Fitzwilliam brought Beauclerk forward shortly before the 1790 general election and Etherington was persuaded to give his support.

The Peace of Amiens saw most of the Yeomanry disbanded, including the Southern West Riding regiment in April 1802. However, the peace quickly broke down and a meeting convened by Earl Fitzwilliam (now the Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding) on 16 July 1803 resolved to re-raise it under the command of Lt-Col Francis Ferrand Foljambe of Aldwark, MP. It was again based at Doncaster, but now consisted of 12 troops, at Barnsley, Tickhill, Doncaster, Hatfield, Rotherham, Kiveton Park, Pontefract, Wath Wood (two), Wakefield and Sheffield (two). The Southern Regiment was now the largest in Yorkshire, but the threat of invasion brought  more regiments and independent troops into existence, so that the West Yorkshire Yeomanry became a force of 1600 men in 33 troops. When an invasion beacon was mistakenly lit and the Yeomanry and Volunteers were called out on 15 August 1805, the Southern Regiment immediately mustered with the local infantry volunteers.
