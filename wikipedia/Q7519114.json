He bowls slow left arm orthodox spin. Kerrigan signed for the Lancashire in September 2008, and made his debut for the first team in 2010, filling in for Gary Keedy, Lancashire's senior spinner. In August 2011, Kerrigan was selected for the England Lions for the first time. The following month he took the best first-class bowling figures for Lancashire since 1953 (9 wickets for 51 runs) and that year Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since 1950.\nThe 2012 season saw Kerrigan replace Keedy as Lancashire's main spinner in first-class cricket.

Kerrigan was chosen ahead of Parry in the four-day team and cemented his place in the side. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. Their partnership began with them competing to out perform each other. After a discussion the pair decided they would be more effective if they worked together to build pressure while bowling.

Lancashire coach Peter Moores said \"We're lucky in some ways in that we've got Stephen Parry, who played quite a lot of first-team cricket last season, but we've also got Simon Kerrigan, who bowled beautifully to take six wickets in the pre-season game against Yorkshire in Barbados and we could also use Steven Crofty's off-spin\".
