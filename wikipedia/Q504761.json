Among the ships following was\u00a0HMS Newport, captained by George Nares, which surveyed the canal on behalf of the Admiralty a few months later. The Newport was involved in an incident that demonstrated some of the problems with the canal. There were suggestions that the depth of parts of the canal at the time of the inauguration were not as great as promised, and that the deepest part of the channel was not always clear, leading to a risk of grounding. The first day of the passage ended at Lake Timsah,  south of Port Said. The French ship P\u00e9luse anchored close to the entrance, then swung around and grounded, the ship and its hawser blocking the way into the lake. The following ships had to anchor in the canal itself until the P\u00e9luse was hauled clear the next morning, making it difficult for them to join that night's celebration in Ismailia. Except for the Newport: Nares sent out a boat to carry out soundings, and was able to manoeuver around the P\u00e9luse to enter the lake and anchor there for the night.This incident appears to have been the basis for a myth that the Newport manoeuvered around the assembled yachts on the night of 16th/17th November, and beat the Aigle to be the first through the canal (see Talk)"]}, {"page": "Tristan da Cunha", "response": ["In 1867, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and second son of Queen Victoria, visited the islands.

Captain George Nares recorded that upon the ship's arrival, the men of Tristan came forward offering potatoes, albatross eggs, and other provisions to his crew.. The Captain recorded a total of 15 families and 86 individuals living on the island. This expedition also aided two German brothers named Stoltenhoff, in moving to the mainland at Cape Town. They had been living on Inaccessible Island since November 1871. They were the only ones to have attempted colonization of any island except the main one."]}]}}
