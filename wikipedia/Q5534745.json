Lowndes was a right-handed batsman and bowled right-arm medium-fast.\nLowndes was a son of William Frith, also a cricketer, who changed his surname and that of his issue from Frith to Frith Lowndes (to \"use the surname of Lowndes in addition to and after that of Frith\") in July 1906. He was educated at New College, Oxford, and made his First-class cricket debut in 1921 for Oxford University against the Free Foresters. In 1924 he joined Hampshire, and played for them to 1935, captaining the side in 1934 and 1935. Lowndes also made five appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club between 1928 and 1934. His final first-class appearance was a mirror to his debut match; Oxford University played the Free Foresters, but this time he played against the university.\nLowndes died in 1982 in Newbury at the age of 84.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
