As fears about an EFL expulsion and liquidation grew, local MPs Amanda Solloway and Andrew Bridgen planned to raise the matter with the sports minister. The Middlesbrough and Wycombe claims, if proved, could leave Derby with liabilities running into millions (the BBC suggested as much as \u00a360 million), as football debts need to be paid in full. Potential purchasers, therefore, were unwilling to commit to buying the club. As a result, the BBC reported on 17 January 2022 that Derby's administrators could seek a legal ruling that the claims do not fall within the normal 'football-related' agreements over issues such as transfer fees and ticket sales. Middlesbrough and Wycombe subsquently said they were willing to discuss a possible compromise. On 20 January 2021, the club's administrators committed to providing the EFL with funding information \"within days\" after the EFL said \"the club will run out of cash by February\". The following day, another bid to buy the club, from the Binnie family, founders of US investment company Carlisle Capital, was reported, but the \u00a328m offer did not include the stadium, against which the MSD Holdings loan is secured. Following the Binnie bid and reports that former chairman Andy Appleby was working on an alternative bid that included the stadium, the EFL and administrators Quantuma were due to meet on 25 January 2022 to discuss the club's future.
