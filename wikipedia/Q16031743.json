He was the scorer of the first two goals for Doncaster Rovers in the Football League.\nBorn in Doncaster, Goodson played for the Marshgate Institute club before moving to Doncaster Rovers in March 1900. He was seen as having the makings of an exceptional player. His first goals were a hat-trick in a 1\u22128 victory in a Midland League game at Rushden on 31 March 1900. In the 1900\u221201 season, he scored 20 goals in 26 league games, including two hat\u2212tricks.
