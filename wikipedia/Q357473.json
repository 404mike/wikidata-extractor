He was the dominant figure in snooker from the 1920s to the 1950s and has been credited with inventing aspects of the way the game is now played, such as break-building. With equipment manufacturer Bill Camkin, he drove the creation of the World Snooker Championship by persuading the Billiards Association and Control Council to recognise an official professional snooker championship in 1927. Davis won the first 15 championships from 1927 to 1946 and remains the only undefeated player in World Snooker Championship history. He scored the championship's first century break, in 1930.\nDavis was a professional English billiards player from the age of 18 and was World Billiards Champion four times between 1928 and 1932. He was the first person to win world titles in both billiards and snooker. After his 1946 World Snooker Championship victory, Davis no longer played in the World Championship but participated in other tournaments and exhibition matches until 1964, winning four News of the World Snooker Tournament titles. He also continued to wield considerable influence over the professional game through his chairmanship of the professional players' association, his co-ownership of the venue Leicester Square Hall, and his negotiation of television contracts. His younger brother Fred Davis was the only person to beat Joe Davis in a competitive snooker match without receiving a start.\nIn 1955, Davis was the first player to make an officially recognised maximum break. He collapsed whilst watching Fred play Perrie Mans in the semi-final of the 1978 World Snooker Championship. Whilst convalescing, Davis contracted a chest infection that led to his death on 10 July that year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 15", "response": ["*1901 \u2013 Joe Davis, English snooker player (d. 1978)"]}, {"page": "Snooker", "response": ["The World Snooker Championship has taken place since 1927.

The 1952 World Snooker Championship was only contested by two players and was replaced by the World Professional Match-play Championship, but was also discontinued in 1957. Feeling that the popularity of the game was waning, Davis introduced a variation known as \"snooker plus\", with the addition of two extra colours, but this failed to attract attention and was very short-lived.

His six-year absence has been attributed to a commitment to practise and improve his standard of play following the resounding defeat by Davis. In 1939, he defeated Herbert Holt and Dickie Laws in the qualifying competition, both 18\u201313, then Claude Falkiner 21\u201310 in the first round, before losing 15\u201316 to Sidney Smith in the quarter-finals. He finished fourth of seven players in the 1939/1940 Daily Mail Gold Cup. The BBC World Service radio station broadcast part of his match against Fred Davis.", "In the 1940 World Championship, he eliminated Holt 24\u20137 in the first round; Joe Davis then defeated him 9\u201322 in the semi-final. The championship was then suspended for the remainder of World War\u00a0II. Donaldson was called up in 1940, and served in Canada, North Africa, Greece and Italy as a sergeant in the Royal Corps of Signals attached to the Fourth Indian Division, which was an original component of the Eighth Army when it was formed in September 1941.", "The championship resumed in 1946, with Joe Davis winning again, including a 21\u201310 victory over Donaldson in the quarter-finals. The professional players that did not reach the 1946 final were invited to participate in the 1946 Albany Club Professional Snooker Tournament. Donaldson won, some six months after being demobilised, by defeating Alec Brown 20\u201311 in the final. Following his 1946 World Championship win, Davis retired from the event.  In November 1946, Donaldson compiled what would have been a new world record for the highest break, 142, against John Pulman, but as the billiard table being used was not of the standard type required for a record, it was not recognised as such.", "Donaldson, based in Belvedere, practised intensively preparing for the 1947 World Championship, using a billiard table in a neighbour's attic. He defeated Stanley Newman 46\u201325 and then eliminated Horace Lindrum 39\u201332 to reach the final. Building refurbishment delays postponed the final, held at Leicester Square Hall, for several weeks. Donaldson used the time to continue practising. In a two-week final against Fred Davis, Donaldson led 4\u20132 after the first  and 7\u20135 after the second, later extending his lead to sixteen frames at 35\u201319. After this, Davis won six successive frames to reduce the lead to 35\u201325. Donaldson secured victory at 73\u201349 and finished the match at 82\u201363. His tactics during the championship involved compiling breaks of around 30 to 50 points, and playing  rather than attempting difficult . Davis became frustrated with the lack of scoring chances Donaldson left for him, and missed a number of difficult pot attempts allowing Donaldson chances to win frames. There were three century breaks during the match's 145 frames, all made by Davis. Joe Davis commented after the match that, \"Donaldson's long potting at present is the equal of anything seen in snooker history,\" whilst Fred Davis said \"he is playing the best snooker I have ever seen\". In his book Talking Snooker, first published in 1979, Fred Davis reflected he had probably been \"perhaps overconfident\" and also had not expected Donaldson's standard to have improved so much as a result of his many hours of practice. This was the first of eight consecutive finals, from 1947 to 1954, featuring the two players, but Donaldson only won one more title in 1950.", "Two wins by Joe Davis in challenge matches against Donaldson after the 1947 championship reinforced the public perception that the 15-time champion Davis was still the best player. Donaldson took a playing break of several months on medical advice, having been diagnosed with conjunctivitis after experiencing headaches. In the 1948 World Snooker Championship held only six months after the 1947 tournament, Donaldson reached the final with wins against Kingsley Kennerley and Albert Brown. Fred Davis won 84\u201361 against Donaldson, having reached a winning margin at 73\u201352. In Talking Snooker, Davis wrote he had consciously used the same risk-averse tactics that had paid off for Donaldson in 1947. At the 1948 Sunday Empire News Tournament, which was a round-robin event with handicaps applied, Donaldson finished fourth of five players.", "After the 1954 World Match-play final, Donaldson announced he would not be playing in any future World Snooker Championships, as he wanted to focus more on the management of his smallholding, although he stated his intention to continue to play in other tournaments and in exhibition matches. With three wins at the 1954/1955 News of the World Snooker Tournament, he failed to gain a high placing. He finished third in 1955/1956, and last in 1956/1957. Donaldson inflicted Fred Davis's only defeat in the 1957/1958 News of the World Snooker Tournament (21\u201316), before finishing third of five players in the final table. Earlier in the same tournament he defeated Joe Davis, also by 21\u201316, but had received a 14-point start. He did, however, make the highest break of the season, 141. He finished bottom of four players in the 1958 News of the World Snooker Tournament table, with one win in nine matches. In 1960, he retired completely from competitive play.", "He was considered one of the greatest long potters of all time, and a very consistent player, partly due to his avoidance of the use of side.

A dominant snooker player in Australia, he lived in Britain for long periods and played in the major British tournaments. From his arrival in Britain in 1935 he was regarded as the second best player in the world, behind Joe Davis. Lindrum contested three World Championship finals against Davis, in 1936, 1937 and 1946, losing all three to Davis but coming close to beating him on several occasions. Lindrum won the 1952 World Championship which, because of a dispute between the governing body and the players' association, was only contested by himself and New Zealander Clark McConachy.", "In late June and early July 1934, Joe Davis had travelled to Australia to play in the World Billiards Championship. Davis received a bye to the final of the Billiards Championship and played Walter Lindrum, the defending Champion, in Melbourne, from 14 to 27 October. Walter Lindrum won a close match 23,553\u201322,678. Davis had been due to leave Australia on 30 October but accepted an offer of a snooker match against Lindrum, delaying his departure until 7 November. An 81-frame snooker match was arranged to be played at the Tivoli Billiard Theatre, Bourke Street, Melbourne from 29 October to 6 November with two sessions of five frames played each day. Davis insisted on using the same table that had been used for the World Billiards Championship final. The match was reported as being the unofficial world championship.", "Immediately after his arrival Lindrum played a week-long billiards match against Tom Newman at Thurston's Hall. Given a 2,000 start, he won 8,348 to 7,883. Lindrum then played Joe Davis in a billiards match, which had two frames of snooker played at the end of each session. Davis gave a 3,000 start but still won 10,348 to 9,847, although Lindrum won the snooker 14\u201310. In December, Lindrum played two snooker-only best-of-61 matches against Joe Davis, played over successive weeks at Thurston's Hall. Lindrum received a 7-point start in each frame. Lindrum won the first match 31\u201330 while Davis won the second 32\u201329. Davis won the side stakes for the overall aggregate score and for the highest break of 104, scored on the final evening, the only century break in the two matches.", "The early part of 1936 was taken up with the Daily Mail Gold Cup. This was a handicap billiards event with Lindrum handicapped in the middle of the 7 competitors, receiving points from 3 and giving to the other 3. Lindrum won 3 of his 6 matches. The Gold Cup was immediately followed by the World Snooker Championship. Lindrum met Bert Terry in the first round, Clare O'Donnell in the quarter-final and Stanley Newman in the semi-final, winning all his matches comfortably. In the final Lindrum met defending champion Joe Davis. Lindrum led 6\u20134 and 11\u20139, before Davis won four out of the next five frames with top breaks of 75 and 78 to lead 13\u201312. However Lindrum levelled the match at 15\u201315, before winning six out of ten frames to lead 21\u201319, and led at the conclusion of the penultimate day 26\u201324. He then won the first frame of the final day, before Davis won the last ten frames in a row to win 34\u201327, having already won the match 31\u201327.", "The 1936 Daily Mail Gold Cup was played as a snooker competition, reflecting snooker's growing importance. It was a handicap event with Joe Davis handicapped as the best player. Lindrum received a 7-point start in each frame from Davis but had to give starts ranging from 7 to 28 to the other four competitors. Lindrum was second in the event behind Davis, winning 3 of his 5 matches. He defeats were by 35\u201336 to Sidney Smith, giving Smith a 7-point start, and 30\u201341 in the final match of the tournament to Davis. The main part of the 1937 World Snooker Championship did not start until late February and the early part of 1937 was mostly taken up with snooker exhibition matches between Lindrum and Davis, Lindrum always receiving a 7-point start in each frame. There were four matches played over a total of 30 days and, with 12 frames a frame being played, they played some 360 frames against other in the period. Lindrum won the first match, in Manchester, 39\u201336, a match that included a break of 141 by Lindrum. The following week, in Coventry, Davis won 39\u201332. Lindrum then won 74\u201369 in a two-week match at Thurston's Hall. He then played a week's billiards against Melbourne Inman before another match against Davis, in Liverpool, which he won 36\u201335.", "Lindrum returned to London to compete in the 1937 World Snooker Championship. He won his quarter-final against Sydney Lee and his semi-final against Willie Smith comfortably and met Joe Davis again in the final. The first day was level at 5\u20135 but Lindrum led 11\u20139 and extended this to 17\u201313 at the half-way stage. The fourth day started with a break of 103 by Davis in frame 31. Davis fouled on his first visit to the table and, after a break of 29 by Lindrum, Davis cleared the table on his second visit. Davis reduced the deficit to 21\u201319 on the fourth day and then won eight frames on the fifth day to lead 27\u201323. After the final afternoon session Davis still led 29\u201326, with Lindrum needing to win five of the six evening frames.

Lindrum lost his first two matches, won the next three and lost to Davis 37\u201334 in the final match. He finished third in the final table. Lindrum did not enter the 1938 World Snooker Championship because he objected to certain conditions, particularly the cloth used. However he played a two-week exhibition match against Davis, the new champion, at Thurston's Hall immediately after the championship. Lindrum received 10 point each frame but Davis won 71\u201362.
