Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame, with Luther declaring that \"he is the master of the notes. They must do as he wills; as for the other composers, they have to do as the notes will.\"Burkholder, J. Peter, Donald Jay Grout, and Claude V. Palisca. A History of Western Music. Ninth edition. New York, N.Y.: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 2014, pp. 203. Theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection.Wegman, pp.\u00a021\u201325. Josquin's fame was only eclipsed after the beginning of the Baroque era, with the decline of the pre-tonal polyphonic style. During the 18th and 19th centuries Josquin's fame was overshadowed by later Roman School composer Palestrina, whose music was seen as the summit of polyphonic refinement, and codified into a system of composition by theorists such as Johann Fux. Despite the decline of popularity in Josquin\u2019s music during this time, Josquin\u2019s influence in music beyond the 15th century cannot be overstated. Travelling Franco-Flemish composers like Josquin were a primary component in Italian chapels. They used their unique styles and ideas to influence Italian music, thus contributing to iconic Italian genres such as the madrigal. During the 20th century, Josquin's reputation has grown steadily, to the point where scholars again consider him \"the greatest and most successful composer of the age.\"David Fallows, in Sherr, p.\u00a0575.Higgins. Due to Josquin\u2019s popularity, scholars have worked diligently to weed out misattributed works. To sell more copies of their compositions, it was not uncommon for composers or publishers to put Josquin\u2019s name on their work both during and after Josquin\u2019s lifetime. Analysis of dissonance treatments and cantus firmi have helped scholars in the past decades to determine which pieces were most likely written by Josquin himself. According to Richard Sherr, writing in the introduction to the Josquin Companion, addressing specifically the shrinking of Josquin's canon due to correction of misattributions, \"Josquin will survive because his best music really is as magnificent as everybody has always said it was.\""]}, {"page": "Tremolo", "response": ["Although it had already been employed as early as 1617 by Biagio Marini and again in 1621 by Giovanni Battista Riccio,David Fallows, \"Tremolo (i)\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, . the bowed tremolo was invented in 1624 by the early 17th-century composer Claudio Monteverdi,Weiss and Taruskin (1984).

The measured tremolo, presumably played with rhythmic regularity, was invented to add dramatic intensity to string accompaniment and contrast with regular tenuto strokes. However, it was not till the time of Gluck that the real tremolo became an accepted method of tone production. Four other types of historical tremolos include the obsolete undulating tremolo, the bowed tremolo, the fingered tremolo (or slurred tremolo), and the bowed-and-fingered tremolo."]}, {"page": "Buxton", "response": ["*David Fallows (born 1945 in Buxton), musicologistResearch page, University of Manchester  retrieved January 2018. specializing in music of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance"]}, {"page": "Gilles Binchois", "response": ["*David Fallows, \"Gilles Binchois,\" The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

Richard Taruskin attempts to prove that Busnois' was the model later L'homme arm\u00e9 masses were based upon through a study of the composer's numerological symbology within the work, and by demonstrating that Dufay and others were emulating (or paying homage) to this aspect, among others.Richard Taruskin, Antoine Busnoys and the \"L'Homme arm\u00e9\" Tradition, Journal of the American Musicological Society 39/2 (Summer, 1986), 255\u2013293 David Fallows points out that the complexity of the Busnois mass may indicate that he was actually borrowing from Dufay.David Fallows, [Letter from David Fallows], Journal of the American Musicological Society 40/1 (Spring, 1987), 146\u2013148 Busnois may even be the composer of a cycle of six Masses all based on the same tune, found in Naples, on the basis of stylistic comparison."]}, {"page": "Aleyn", "response": ["Aleyn (fl. c. 1400) was an English composer.
