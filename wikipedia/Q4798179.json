Animal taxonomist Arthur Cain treated the subspecies as synonymous to the nominate as the only difference he knew of was the colour of the cheeks, but conceded further evidence could prove them distinct. As well as the differences in cheek plumage, the two differ in that subspecies hillii has brighter yellow  feathers on the breast and belly with thinner black edges, and a consistently longer and wider bill. A subspecies,  P. venustus melvillensis from Melville Island, was described by Mathews in 1912, noting it to have blacker plumage on its back.
