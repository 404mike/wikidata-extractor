His research has ranged from speech errors and pauses, short-term memory deficits, reading and the dyslexias both in alphabetic scripts and Chinese, and mathematics and dyscalculia. He has also pioneered educational neuroscience, notably in the study of learners with special educational needs (Educational Neuroscience, 2013). \nHe read psychology and philosophy at Oxford University (1963-1966). He completed an MA on G\u00f6del's theorem at Sussex University (1967-1968) under the direction of Peter Nidditch, and a PhD in psycholinguistics at UCL supervised by Frieda Goldman-Eisler, the first professor of psycholinguistics in the UK.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philosophy of mathematics", "response": ["For experimental evidence suggesting that human infants can do elementary arithmetic, see Brian Butterworth."]}, {"page": "List of psychologists", "response": ["* Brian Butterworth"]}, {"page": "Dyscalculia", "response": ["The term 'dyscalculia' was coined in the 1940s, but it was not completely recognized until 1974 by the work of Czechoslovakian researcher Ladislav Kosc. Kosc defined dyscalculia as \"a structural disorder of mathematical abilities.\" His research proved that the learning disability was caused by impairments to certain parts of the brain that control mathematical calculations and not because symptomatic individuals were 'mentally handicapped'. Researchers now sometimes use the terms \"math dyslexia\" or \"math learning disability\" when they mention the condition. Cognitive disabilities specific to mathematics were originally identified in case studies with patients who experienced specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to specific regions of the brain.  More commonly, dyscalculia occurs developmentally as a genetically linked learning disability which affects a person's ability to understand, remember, or manipulate numbers or number facts (e.g., the multiplication tables). The term is often used to refer specifically to the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but is also defined by some educational professionals and cognitive psychologists such as Stanislas Dehaene and Brian Butterworth as a more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in \"number sense\"), which these researchers consider to be a foundational skill upon which other mathematics abilities build. Symptoms of dyscalculia include the delay of simple counting, inability to memorize simple arithmetic facts such as adding, subtracting, etc. There are few known symptoms because little research has been done on the topic."]}, {"page": "Harris Academy St John's Wood", "response": ["* Prof. Brian Butterworth, Professor of Cognitive Neuropsychology since 1992 at University College London"]}, {"page": "List of cognitive scientists", "response": ["* Brian Butterworth (speech, dyslexia, mathematics)"]}, {"page": "Linguistics (journal)", "response": ["Linguistics was started in 1963 by Mouton Publishers in The Hague, apparently on the initiative of Mouton's Peter de Ridder as well as linguist C.H. van Schooneveld.Johan van der Auwera: Linguistics, the first 50 years, 2013.
