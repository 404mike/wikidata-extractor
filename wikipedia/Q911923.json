Best known as producer of Tears for Fears' Songs from the Big Chair, and as the co-writer of \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", Hughes has a joint background as a musician, songwriter and producer. His career began with Adam and The Ants as drummer and producer of the \"Cartrouble\" and \"Kings of the Wild Frontier\" singles, then the Kings of the Wild Frontier album. Yielding three hit singles, the album earned Hughes Music Week 's 'Producer of the Year Award'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Reich", "response": ["The 1967 prototype piece Slow Motion Sound was not performed although Chris Hughes performed it 27 years later as Slow Motion Blackbird on his Reich-influenced 1994 album Shift. It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to Four Organs (1970), which deals specifically with augmentation. The piece has maracas playing a fast eighth note pulse, while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord. This work therefore dealt with repetition and subtle rhythmic change. In contrast to Reich's typical cyclical structure, Four Organs is unique among his work in using a linear structure\u2014the superficially similar Phase Patterns, also for four organs but without maracas, is (as the name suggests) a cyclical phase piece similar to others composed during the period. Four Organs was performed as part of a Boston Symphony Orchestra program, and was Reich's first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting."]}, {"page": "XTC", "response": ["Of his guitar technique, Partridge said that it evolved from his desire to be a drummer, to \"chop and slash and try to work between what the drums were doing, a) so I could be heard, and b) because I liked the funk and I liked working the holes that the drums left.\" He was particularly influenced by John French, the drummer for Captain Beefheart's Magic Band, although he disliked that the drummer's groove would change every few bars. Gregory attributed XTC's unorthodox drum patterns to Partridge's affinity for dub and reggae; \"He's got a great innate sense of rhythm. He'll say 'No, don't put that beat there, why don't you come down on 3 instead of 2 on this part here?' ... He never put [cymbal crashes] where you'd expect to find them.\"  Producer Chris Hughes likened the band's fashion of playing guitar to an automated music sequencer."]}, {"page": "Kings of the Wild Frontier", "response": ["* Merrick (Chris Hughes) \u2013 drums, production", "Category:Albums produced by Chris Hughes (musician)"]}, {"page": "Dirk Wears White Sox", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Chris Hughes (musician)"]}, {"page": "The Seeds of Love", "response": ["Recording sessions for the album began in late 1986 with producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, but Orzabal and Smith were unhappy with the results and so the recordings were scrapped in early 1987.

I'll give Chris Hughes his due: he was a big supporter of 'Rule the World' and we weren't that sure of it, and in America that was the first single they really went for. And it broke the market for us.\" Smith added: \"'Shout' is the obvious stadium thing. We consciously started with the chorus. It was kind of a sing-along; a protest song-like 'Give Peace a Chance', or 'Hey Jude', even... But we never imagined it would take off like that. We're from Bath. We're not part of any scene. We've never been fashionable. We're quite insulated when we make records. What happens afterwards is really out of our hands. It's not something you can really plan for. We certainly can't. I don't think we're that clever.\"", "Songs from the Big Chair received critical acclaim. In his review, critic Barry McIlheney of Melody Maker stated that \"none of you should really be too surprised that Tears for Fears have made such an excellent album\", calling it \"an album that fully justifies the rather sneering, told-you-so looks adopted by Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal on the sleeve\", before concluding, \"An awful lot of people will, of course, go on and on about overcoats, The Lotus Eaters and an alleged lack of depth. And an awful lot of people will have to eat an awful lot of words.\" Ian Cranna of Smash Hits described it as \"looser, more exploratory than before\" in nature, and noted its \"unflinching lyrical honesty\". Rolling Stone critic Don Shewey wrote that Tears for Fears \"sounds a lot like a lot of other British bands\" and observed traces of \"U2's social conscience, the Bunnymen's echoing guitars and XTC's contorted pop wit\" on the album, but commented that Chris Hughes' production \"nudges Songs from the Big Chair slightly ahead of the pack.\"", "In February 2020, the album was the focus of an episode of the BBC's Classic Albums documentary series.
