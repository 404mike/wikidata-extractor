Derbyshire spinners Ant Botha and Andy Gray got cheap wickets towards the end, as White was left stranded on 67 not out with the lower-order making insignificant contributions. However, Chris Silverwood and Richard Dawson chipped away at the Derbyshire batting line-up, taking two wickets each as Michael Di Venuto was fairly alone with his 79 and Derbyshire made their way to 247 for 7 at stumps on day 2. That turned out to be the score at the end of day 3 as well, rain preventing any play as the match moved closer to a draw. Derbyshire's late-order battled for another thirty overs before they were bundled out for 350, and despite Deon Kruis snaring two early wickets in the follow on, Derbyshire survived 60 overs to make 173 for 5 at the end of day four and save the draw."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Derbyshire, who had replaced pace bowler Kevin Dean with Andy Gray, batted first at Old Trafford, and were dismissed for 215, with Luke Sutton top-scoring with 95.

Leicestershire's last man, Claude Henderson, was caught on the last ball, and his team all out for 137. Derbyshire's reply was shortened by rain, and they only got 14 overs to hit 103, and two wickets from David Masters set them back to 44 for 3. However, 42 from Luke Sutton in a 61-run stand with Botha ensured that Derbyshire made it to the target with seven balls to spare.", "Phil Jaques and Anthony McGrath lifted Yorkshire to a total of 570 with a third-wicket partnership of 310, 13 off the county record set in 1928.

Usman Afzaal added 59 from number four as well, and half-centuries from David Sales and Riki Wessels, ensured that Northamptonshire could declare with a lead of 388, giving themselves five sessions to win the game. Welch got no further wicket, but conceded 63 runs, while spinner Andy Gray got two wickets but at a cost of 65 runs per wicket. The weather forecast for the final day, however, had predicted rain, so Northamptonshire wanted to get wickets early.
