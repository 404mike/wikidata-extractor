In 2013, Flavell received the Vilcek Prize in Biomedical Science. In July 2016, Flavell received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Hull. He is an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Titia de Lange", "response": ["Titia de Lange originally wanted to study chemistry after finishing high school in the Netherlands but the lack of women in chemistry among students and teachers alike convinced her to study biology with a biochemistry track instead. In her time at the University of Amsterdam she worked for mentor Richard Flavell at the National Institute for Medical Research where she completed her master's thesis. Her thesis focused on DNA translocation in \u03b3\u03b2-thalassemia, a very rare form of thalassemia.Kioussis, D., Vanin, E., deLange, T., Flavell, R. A., & Grosveld, F. G. (1983). \u03b2-Globin gene inactivation by DNA translocation in \u03b3\u03b2-thalassaemi. Nature, 306, 662. JOUR. Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/306662a0 Her research identified a patient with \u03b3\u03b2-thalassemia with a DNA translocation that caused the inactivation of the \u03b2-Globin gene. de Lange spoke highly of the lab saying \"That was where I first saw how science is really done. \u2026 It was a very vibrant, competitive, international lab. It was a lot of fun, so that made me stay in science.\""]}]}}
