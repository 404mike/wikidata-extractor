He became a lawyer, and after briefly working in Cyprus left to join the Service des Antiquit\u00e9s in Egypt, an organisation run by French scholars to prevent the illicit trade in Egyptian artifacts.\nFirth worked on the first archaeological survey of Nubia of 1907 to 1911. In 1912 he set up the Aswan Museum. He became the inspector of antiquities at Saqqara and began to explore the complex of Djoser's Step Pyramid in Saqqara where, in 1924, he discovered the serdab of the pharaoh, which is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.Firth then worked in collaboration with James E. Quibell and subsequently with Jean-Philippe Lauer on his arrival on the site in 1926.In 1928 and 1929, Firth began the opening of the funerary complex of Userkaf, the first king of the 5th dynasty, and that of a small pyramid located just at the south, allotted to his queen. In early 1930 he worked on the Headless Pyramid, believing it to be a pyramid of a king of the First Intermediate Period. It is now understood that the pyramid belongs to Menkauhor Kaiu of the Fifth Dynasty.\nFirth's wife was Winifred (Freda) Nest Firth (n\u00e9e Hansard, 1871\u20131937), a painter and copyist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Egyptologists", "response": ["*Cecil Mallaby Firth (British, 1878\u20131931)"]}, {"page": "Userkaf", "response": ["The head of a colossal larger-than-life sphinx statue of Userkaf, now in the Egyptian Museum, was found in the temple courtyard of his mortuary complex at Saqqara by Cecil Mallaby Firth in 1928.

It is the largest surviving head dating to the Old Kingdom other than that of the Great Sphinx of Giza and the only colossal royal statue from this period.

Those same texts were discovered in Unas's tomb, making this their earliest known appearance. From 1899 to 1901, the architect and Egyptologist Alessandro Barsanti conducted the first systematic investigation of the pyramid site, succeeding in excavating part of the mortuary temple, as well as a series of tombs from the Second Dynasty and the Late Period. Later excavations by Cecil Mallaby Firth, from 1929 until his death in 1931, followed by those of the architect Jean-Philippe Lauer from 1936 to 1939, were conducted with little success. The archaeologists Selim Hassan, Muhammed Zakaria Goneim and A. H. Hussein mainly focused on the causeway leading to the pyramid while conducting their investigations from 1937 to 1949. Hussein discovered a pair of limestone-lined boat pits at the upper end of the causeway. In the 1970s, Ahmad Moussa excavated the lower half of the causeway and the valley temple. Moussa and another archaeologist, , conducted an architectural survey of the valley temple from 1971 to 1981. The pyramids of Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Merenre were the subjects of a major architectural and epigraphic project in Saqqara, led by Jean Leclant. From 1999 until 2001, the Supreme Council of Antiquities conducted a major restoration and reconstruction project on the valley temple.
