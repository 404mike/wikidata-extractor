He began his journalistic career with the Western Gazette in Yeovil before moving on to the Bristol Evening World. From 1962 onwards he worked largely as a freelance. In the national press he contributed primarily to The Guardian from 1971 to 2011, writing chiefly on Somerset and Gloucestershire cricket, together with some football reports and theatre reviews. He also wrote a weekly column for the Western Daily Press for about 20 years. According to Scyld Berry, he was one of the last regional writers. It was \"not only the quality of his work, but the speed\" with which he wrote that was remarkable.Foot's book Beyond Bat & Ball won the Cricket Society\u2019s Book of the Year award in 1993. Reviewing it in Wisden, Geoffrey Moorhouse agreed with the opinion of Dennis Silk in the book's foreword that as a writer Foot \"is as good as Robertson-Glasgow at his best\". Silk also said: \"If the cricket lover is not quite clear about why he loves the game, he will become much clearer after reading this book.\"The sport journalist Frank Keating called Foot's biographies of Harold Gimblett and Wally Hammond \"imperishable classics in cricket's canon\". Before Gimblett committed suicide, he had entrusted to Foot the tapes he had recorded about his cricket career. By incorporating quotations from those tapes in his biography and revealing his mental anguish, Foot \"removed our rose-coloured spectacles about cricket\" and helped to enable other cricketers such as Peter Roebuck and Marcus Trescothick to speak out about their own mental problems.According to Berry, he was \"fascinated by every aspect of life\". This was illustrated by his taking on the editorship of the memoir of Victoria Hughes, a lavatory attendant who took care of the prostitutes who worked at the lavatories on Bristol Downs. Berry says this was one of his most valuable books. He was \"the dearest and most decent of men, because he had acute sensibility for people, and trees, and words\".Foot lived in the Bristol suburb of Westbury-on-Trym with his wife Anne. They had a son and a daughter. He died in May 2021, aged 92.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["Towards the end of the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; according to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning.Hammond, pp. 28\u201329. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his teammates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip.Foot, pp. 19\u201320. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12\u00a0operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened to the point where the doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him.Howat, p. 27. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season.Foot, pp. 42\u201343. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home.Foot, pp. 36\u201340. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour.Foot, pp. 21\u201322, 36\u201356. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory.Murphy, p. 98. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.Howat, p. 29.Hammond, p. 30.", "David Foot quotes an unnamed cricketer saying that the two ruling passions of Hammond's life \"were his cricket bat and his genitals\".Foot, p. 171. His strong desire for women was noticed by teammates from early in his career.Foot, p. 172 Foot believes that Hammond had sexual relationships with many women, sometimes several contemporaneously, before and during his first marriage, some of which led to marriage proposals.Foot, pp. 172\u201385.

He was known for his fast scoring as an opening batsman and for the much-repeated story of his debut. In a book first published in 1982, the cricket writer and Somerset historian David Foot wrote: \"Harold Gimblett is the greatest batsman Somerset has ever produced.\"Foot, p. 1.", "Having a two-week trial with Somerset, Gimblett had been told, before the period was over, that he had no future as a first-class cricketer. Accounts vary as to how this decision was reached. Gimblett himself, quoted in David Foot's biography, which relies heavily on material taped by Gimblett in the years immediately before his death, said he was told by the county secretary and former captain, John Daniell: \"You may as well finish the week. We'll pay you 35 shillings and your bus fare. Afraid you're just not good enough.\"Foot, p. 60. Daniell's son, quoted in the same book, said that the Somerset professional players had advised against taking Gimblett on to the county staff: \"They used to tell my father they thought Harold was far too impulsive.\"Foot, p. 62. A further factor may have been the almost permanent financial crisis that surrounded Somerset: the county club was probably not able to afford another professional player.", "David Foot's biography of Gimblett indicates that this 1936 season, although one of his most successful, also showed early signs of the illness that was to afflict him later. He reacted badly to being criticised for dropping an easy catch in the Old Trafford Test, and when he himself was dropped from the team for the final Test, he responded with relief: \"'Thank goodness that's over,' he said to anyone within earshot.\"Foot, p. 82. Foot wrote: \"The Lord's and Old Trafford Tests became painful rather than treasured memories; he pleaded silently that he would not ever be selected again.\"Foot, p. 83.", "The return in 1947 was lower, but in 1948, with the Somerset batting seeming ever more dependent on him for runs, he responded with all of the four centuries scored by the team in the summer, and one of them was his own highest score and the highest innings made to that stage by a Somerset batsman: 310 against Sussex at Eastbourne. The previous Somerset record had been 292, set by the late Victorian era amateur Lionel Palairet. Gimblett told his biographer David Foot, on the tapes that form the backbone of the biography, that he had said on the pitch at Eastbourne to Sussex player James Langridge: \"Well, that's got rid of one amateur's name in our county's record books.\"Foot, p. 102. Gimblett went on to say that a collection had been proposed to mark the feat, but that Somerset's secretary had been dismissive of the idea. \"I think that was when I first decided that my career with Somerset was going to end. I was deeply hurt,\" he said.Foot, p. 103.", "David Foot, the author of Gimblett's biography, wrote in his history of Somerset cricket that Gimblett \"retained obsessive complexes about class, money and health\". In the biography, Foot writes of discovering the depth and the variety of Gimblett's different hatreds: \"The hate\u00a0\u2013 his uncompromising word\u00a0\u2013 was spread over a wide area.\"Foot, p. 121.

Between 1903 and the cessation of county cricket due to the First World War, Somerset never finished higher than tenth in the County Championship.Foot (1986), p. 218. Poyntz himself struggled for runs between 1906 and 1909: in thirty matches for the county, he failed to score a half-century. Statistically, his worst season came in 1907, when he averaged just 4.66 runs per innings. His most notable incident that season occurred during the match against Middlesex at Lord's. In his own benefit match, Albert Trott claimed two hat-tricks; Poyntz was one of the victims, falling for a second innings duck.", "That optimism was not reflected in Somerset's results the following year. Further financial losses were made, and the county finished second-bottom of the championship. On a personal level, Poyntz scored more runs than in any other season, accruing 642 during his 19 matches at an average of 18.34, and scored three half-centuries. The start of the First World War during the summer of 1914 resulted in the cancellation of some matches, along with a number of players joining the armed forces, disrupting the end of the cricket season.Roebuck (1991), p. 113. Although Somerset fared poorly under his charge, David Foot claims that Poyntz received \"more praise than criticism\" for his captaincy.Foot (1986), p. 95.", "Although not highly thought of as a batsman, Poyntz was known for being able to hit the ball hard. A right-handed batsman, he is described as lacking \"technique and consistency\" by David Foot, but obituaries suggest that his shortage of talent was offset by application of effort. Wisden declared him \"an excellent fielder\", but Foot is more reserved, describing him as a \"passable slip fielder\". Sammy Woods was Poyntz's godfather, while Poyntz in turn acted as a godfather to John Daniell's son Nigel. David Foot portrays an element of caricature about Poyntz, describing him as, \"a tall man who slammed his hair back with a distinctive parting in the middle.\" He also related a story from a Somerset teammate in which Poyntz claimed that he could trace him family all the way back to William the Conqueror, and had a massive coat of arms in his Bristol flat."]}, {"page": "Stuart Rogers", "response": ["Rogers was captain in 89 of the 119 first-class matches he appeared in. His instincts appear to have been largely attacking, and he had a limited and ageing side at his disposal.

But Eric Hill, one of the young players of the time and later the doyen of the Taunton press box, \"feels that Rogers probably lacked rapport with the younger professionals\".

In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches.

In three of the four years prior to 1912, Somerset had finished bottom of the championship table, and there was little improvement in the final three years before the First World War, each of which resulted in a bottom-three finish.Roebuck (1991), p. 411. The Somerset cricket historian, David Foot, records that at this time, the county's recruitment policy was \"susceptible to exotic grandeur and haughty lineage,\" and suggested that a player's cricketing ability was often a secondary consideration to their social standing. Bajana made his debut for Somerset in May 1912, opening the batting for the county against Sussex. He scored twenty-two and seven in a six-wicket victory for his county. In the subsequent match, against Hampshire, Bajana scored his first half-century in county cricket, hitting 71 runs in the second innings; the highest score of any Somerset batsman in the match. He passed 50 on three further occasions that year, and along with Len Braund and Ernie Robson, was ever-present in the Somerset team that season. His year's aggregate of 575 runs in the County Championship, and his score of 95, made against Worcestershire in August, were both the county's best that season, in a year in which no player scored a century for Somerset.", "In his history of Somerset cricket, David Foot describes Bajana as a \"smallish solidly built opening bat\".

For a time, he ran an antiques and art dealership in Bayswater, London with Constantine Diamandis, but they dissolved their partnership in early 1920.

The flat pitch at the County Ground, Taunton did not help their efforts; the imbalance in favour of the batsmen meant that all but one match at the ground was drawn.

In total, six of Somerset's eight home matches contained scores of 500 or over in a single innings. In contrast, 500 was reached in only one of their away matches, by Hampshire at The Rose Bowl. The home conditions helped three of Somerset's batsmen pass 1,000 first-class runs in the season, including Craig Kieswetter and Arul Suppiah, who were both awarded their county caps after passing the landmark.
