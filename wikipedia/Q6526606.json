The cement which binds their friendship is a deep love of cricket - but the ride is not always smooth. David finds himself falling for the indifferent Judy, but tensions between other families in the street, and a romantic relationship between Ruth Wiseman (Emily Woof) and Dennis, threaten to break apart the neighbourhood."]}, {"page": "Tube Tales", "response": ["Cast: (in alphabetical order) Joao Costa Menezes (?); Do\u00f1a Croll (Elizabeth); Leonie Elliott (Rosebud); Danny Cerqueira (Station Guard); Frank Harper (Station Guard); Ian Puleston-Davies (Typewriter Man); Rachel Weisz (Angela)."]}, {"page": "Leonie", "response": ["* Leonie Elliott (born 1988), British actress"]}, {"page": "List of Jamaican British people", "response": ["* Leonie Elliott (born 1988), actress"]}, {"page": "Call the Midwife", "response": ["Call the Midwife is a BBC period drama series about a group of nurse midwives working in the East End of London in the late 1950s and 1960s.
