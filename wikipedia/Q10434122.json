His first season was disrupted by injury, but in 2004\u201305, he established himself as the first-choice right back and a firm fan favourite. The season was a highly successful one for Finnan. He scored his first and only goal for Liverpool against West Bromwich Albion, played in the League Cup final, and was in the starting eleven as Liverpool won the Champions League Final, though a thigh injury meant he was substituted at half time.

On 24 minutes, Pembridge and Gabbiadini set up Johnson but he sliced his shot wide of the Leicester goal.  Three minutes later, Derby took the lead: Simpson's through-ball found Johnson who out-ran both Simon Grayson and Brian Carey before scoring past Ward.
