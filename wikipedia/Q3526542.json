The team consisted of six specialist batsmen, wicket-keeper Geoff Millman, two spinners and two pace bowlers, supplemented by Dexter as a third seamer. Pakistan, captained by Javed Burki, selected seven batsman, including the keeper Imtiaz Ahmed. They surprisingly omitted Mohammad Farooq and left themselves with one pace bowler, Mahmood Hussain. Their other three bowlers were seamer Antao D'Souza, leg spinner Intikhab Alam and all-rounder Nasim-ul-Ghani who bowled a mixture of left arm seam and orthodox spin.", "Brian Statham was fit again and, despite his good performance at Lord's, Coldwell had to give way. England also recalled John Murray, replacing Geoff Millman as the keeper, and preferred Fred Titmus to Tony Lock who was expensive during the Burki-Nasim stand at Lord's. Pakistan, whose injury problems were beginning to mount up, made three changes because Imtiaz, Wallis Mathias and D'Souza could not play. Their replacements were Butt, who had played at Edgbaston but not at Lord's, fast-medium bowler Munir Malik and off-spinner Javed Akhtar who had literally just arrived from Pakistan, having been called up as a reinforcement. With the winter tour still more on the minds of the England selectors than anything else, they decided to let Cowdrey captain the team in this match. Javed Burki captained Pakistan as in the two previous Tests."]}, {"page": "Roy Booth", "response": ["Booth's contribution to the success was substantial. Taller than many wicket-keepers of the period, he seemed well-equipped to handle Worcestershire's battery of fast-medium bowlers in the late 1950s, led by Jack Flavell and Len Coldwell. But the emergence from 1960 of a more balanced bowling attack, with the arrival of first Doug Slade and then Norman Gifford, both slow left-arm, not only gave Worcestershire a Championship-winning edge but also showed Booth to be among the best all-round wicket-keepers in the country at the time. Despite his record, he appears never to have been close to Test selection, as the long-standing Godfrey Evans was succeeded as England wicketkeeper by a series of players (Roy Swetman, John Murray, Geoff Millman, Jim Parks) a few years younger than Booth."]}, {"page": "Peter Taylor (English cricketer)", "response": ["Taylor made a single List A appearance for the team, during the 1967 Gillette Cup, against Northamptonshire.
