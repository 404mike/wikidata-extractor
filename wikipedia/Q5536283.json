He emigrated to Canada in 1826. After teaching in York for three years, he joined the Upper Canada College staff when it first opened in 1829. There he was also involved in the finances and a scandal that occurred in 1839. The scandal, details of which are hazy, also involved Bishop John Strachan and caused Barber's dismissal.\nAt about this time, Barber had started a public accounting business which he continued throughout his life. He became auditor for the city of Toronto soon after Upper Canada College and also edited the Toronto Herald until its demise.\nIn 1844, he became the first superintendent of schools for Toronto and was involved with the board of education in some capacity until his death. He was part of the period of critical growth for this community resource.\nAn avid sportsman, his particular interest in cricket led to some popularity of the sport in Canada and the establishment of the Toronto Cricket Club in 1827.\nBarber is buried in St. James Cemetery in Toronto.", "link_mentions": {}}}
