He briefly considered John Lithgow for the part of John Reed because the two were similar in appearance, but eventually Beatty decided to act in the film and direct it himself. Nicholson was cast as Eugene O'Neill over James Taylor and Sam Shepard. Nicholson was older than the young O'Neill he was playing, and having just completed work on Kubrick's The Shining, was in a \"most shambolic\" and \"grotesque\" physical state, according to producer Simon Relph. But Nicholson was committed to the role and appeared at the start of filming four months later having lost the weight he had gained and looking much younger.", "Beatty and Keaton's romantic relationship also began to deteriorate during filming. Peter Biskind wrote about the making of Reds, \"Beatty's relationship with Keaton barely survived the shoot. It is always a dicey proposition when an actress works with a star or director\u2014both, in this case\u2014with whom she has an offscreen relationship. Keaton appeared in more scenes than any other actor save Beatty, and many of them were difficult ones, where she had to assay a wide range of feelings, from romantic passion to anger, and deliver several lengthy, complex, emotional speeches.\" George Plimpton once observed, \"Diane almost got broken. I thought [Beatty] was trying to break her into what Louise Bryant had been like with John Reed.\" Executive producer Simon Relph adds, \"It must have been a strain on their relationship because he was completely obsessive, relentless.\""]}, {"page": "Bath Spa University", "response": ["*Simon Relph, assistant film director and producer"]}, {"page": "Emma Relph", "response": ["Emma Relph is a British actress, best known for her role of Jo in The Day of the Triffids.
