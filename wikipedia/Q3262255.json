However, the new civic leaders insisted that the vestry hall had to be demolished in 1968 to make way for a \"Civic Suite\" which was designed by A Sutton and completed in November 1971. Meanwhile, on the south side of Catford Road, St Laurence's Church was also demolished in 1968 to make way for an additional office block for council use known as St Laurence's House. A statue by Gerda Rubinstein entitled Pensive Girl was unveiled outside the building in 1992."]}]}}
