His exploits in the air, watched by Winston Churchill and Lord Kitchener, indirectly led to the creation of the Royal Flying Corps.\nBertram Dickson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on 21 December 1873. In 1892 Dickson accompanied the geographer Sir Thomas Holdich to the Andes Mountains to define the border between Chile and Argentina. After officer training at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Dickson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in November 1894. He was promoted to lieutenant in November 1897 and in November 1900 he was promoted to captain.The following May, Dickson was seconded for service with the Foreign Office. By 1908, Dickson was in the Ottoman Armenian city of Van serving as the military attach\u00e9 and vice-consul.At the beginning of 1910, he enrolled at the Farman flying school at Mourmelon, and gained Aero-Club de France license no. 81 on 12 April.\nDickson took part in the Lanark flying meet in August 1910, where he won the \u00a3400 prize for the greatest aggregate distance flown.In September 1910, Dickson flew one of the two Bristol Boxkites that took part in the British army manouevres on Salisbury plain: his aircraft was captured by the opposing team when he landed to report the result of his reconnaissance by telephone.\n\nOn 1 October 1910, while in Milan, Dickson was involved in the first mid-air collision between two aeroplanes. An Antoinette monoplane, piloted by Ren\u00e9 Thomas of France, rammed Dickson's Farman biplane. Both pilots were injured in the crash. Although Dickson survived, he never fully recovered from his injuries, which contributed to his early death on 28 September 1913. His body was buried in the Highland village of Achanalt in Ross and Cromarty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1873", "response": ["* December 21 \u2013 Captain Bertram Dickson, Scottish soldier, explorer and pioneer aviator; involved in the world's first mid-air collision (d. 1913)"]}, {"page": "Air Battalion Royal Engineers", "response": ["* Bertram Dickson \u2013 first British serviceman to fly in 1910, pre-dating the Air Battalion"]}, {"page": "1910 in aviation", "response": ["* 3 October \u2013 The first mid-air collision takes place near Milan.

The structure bearing the front elevator also differed substantially: the elevator was mounted lower down, level with the lower wing, and the undercarriage skids were continued forward and upwards to form part of the elevator mounting.

George Mestach was told this but went up in his Morane-Borel monoplane before Gill landed. Mestach did not see that Gill had not yet landed and collided with Gill's tail rigging. The two planes crashed, in a similar fashion to the 1910 Ren\u00e9 Thomas - Bertram Dickson crash at Milan.
