After serving five years in the Royal Navy during World War II he returned to Oxford as a Fellow of first New College and then Wadham College, where between 1947 and 1961 he was in succession Dean, Domestic Bursar and Senior Tutor.\nBamborough left Wadham to embark on an ambitious project that was to change the shape of the University. As recounted by a former student:\n\nIn the early 1960s, the University of Oxford was struggling to come to terms with the advent of a growing and strange new group of 'students'\u2014graduate students, neither the undergraduates nor the dons with which it was familiar\u2014who were often foreign to both the country and its traditions. A 'graduate' college was mooted and found a building. It needed an inspired touch: a young head, a scholar ... someone acquainted with university administration\u2014and preferably possessing real personality. John Bamborough\u2014always known to all and sundry as 'Bam' for as long as I've known\u2014was clearly the man.\n\nThe outcome was Linacre College (initially Linacre House), the first Oxford University college to accept only graduate students and the first to admit men and women on an equal basis. Bamborough had the central role in establishing and nurturing the new institution and he remained its Principal until 1988, also serving within the university administration as a member of the Hebdomadal Council from 1961 to 1979 and as Chairman of the General Board of the Faculties from 1964 to 1967. He is fondly remembered by many students and staff, one of whom wrote in a book dedicated to the Principal,\n\nHe was intelligent, scholarly and articulate\u2014we expect that of all Oxford dons\u2014but above that, he was gracious, witty, fair, farsighted, optimistic and compassionate.\nAfter retiring as Principal, Bamborough focused on scholarship. Since 1979 he had been working on the world's first full commentary on Robert Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy, an enormous 17th Century book with hundreds of obscure sources. The final volume of  Bamborough's work was published in 2000, nine years before his death. An accommodation building on the main Linacre College site is named in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linacre College, Oxford", "response": ["Founding Principal John Bamborough described it as \"a deliberate experiment by the University to see whether the needs of graduate students could be met by a new type of society.\"", "* 1962\u20131988: John Bamborough, founding principal"]}, {"page": "List of Wadham College, Oxford people", "response": ["* John Bamborough, scholar of English literature and founding Principal of Linacre College, Oxford", "* John Bamborough 1947\u201354, founding Principal of Linacre College, Oxford"]}, {"page": "List of Old Haberdashers", "response": ["* Professor John Bamborough, Founder of Linacre College, Oxford"]}, {"page": "J.
