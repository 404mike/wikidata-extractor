The Greatbatch innovation varied from the earlier Swedish devices in using primary cells (mercury battery) as the energy source. The first patient lived for a further 18 months.", "The preceding implantable devices all suffered from the unreliability and short lifetime of the available primary cell technology which was mainly that of the mercury battery. In the late 1960s, several companies, including ARCO in the USA, developed isotope-powered pacemakers, but this development was overtaken by the development in 1971 of the lithium iodide cell battery by Wilson Greatbatch. Lithium-iodide or lithium anode cells became the standard for future pacemaker designs."]}, {"page": "Danby, New York", "response": ["* Wilson Greatbatch (1919-2011).
