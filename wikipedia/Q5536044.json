The medicinal qualities of the spring water had been known to locals since at least the mid-18th century (indeed, cattle and sheep which drank from a particular drinking trough were said always to arrive at market in much better condition), and in the 1820s Abercromby had the qualities of the water scientifically analysed by the Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow. He confirmed their exceptionally high mineral content and medicinal qualities.  On the back of this, Abercromby (by now in his eighties) decided to make the waters available for the public good, and invested in a properly engineered well-head to secure the source. When the scientific report was published, \"the Airthrey waters\" became famous and people soon came in large numbers to take them. Herein lay the origins of adjoining Bridge of Allan as a spa town: it was transformed from a \"sequestered retreat of rural life\" to \"a favoured resort of elegance and fashion\", with the springs one of the highest quality in Great Britain.
