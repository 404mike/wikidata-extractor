However, the partnership was born out of a dark period for the group, due to difficulties with their European label, Play It Again Sam. Meat Beat Manifesto, originally the duo of Jack Dangers and Johnny Stephens, struggled to find any labels willing to support them in the UK throughout their formative years in the late 1980s. This prompted the band to accept an unfavorable deal with Belgian label Play It Again Sam. Jack Dangers recalled, \"I couldn't get a label to sign me in the UK, and that's why I ended up in a disastrous contract with Belgian label PIAS (Play It Again Sam).\" In spite of this, the deal sparked interest from many labels in the US. Venerable imprints such as Wax Trax! Records and Mute Records would license the band's early material in the United States, such as Storm the Studio, Armed Audio Warfare, 99% and Satyricon, which gave MBM an increased Stateside following. Dangers reflected, \"I remember going to see Mute Records in 1988 and they weren't interested in the slightest in what I was doing. Two years later they were running all over the world to sign me for the American end of the deal because PIAS only had me signed for Europe. It's funny how two years prior they wouldn't even listen to my records.\"", "Meat Beat Manifesto would support Subliminal Sandwich with extensive touring across the United States and Europe, featuring a line-up of Jack Dangers, John Wilson on guitar, Lynn Farmer on drums and Mike Powell on samples and keys. In 1996, the band took part in the \"Nights Of Nothing\" label showcase, which featured label-mates Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails, with the latter's line-up including Clint Mansell of Pop Will Eat Itself and Kevin McMahon from Prick.", "In 1997, Trent Reznor invited Plug to remix the Nine Inch Nails track The Perfect Drug, which had been heavily inspired by UK electronic music.  There exists confusion about how Trent had come to know Vibert's work, with Vibert himself stating, \"I could never understand how I got it (The Perfect Drug remix) in the first place.  Somehow, Trent heard my stuff and really liked it.\" He added, \"Someone told me that Alex Paterson from The Orb played my Plug stuff for Trent and someone else told me that Coil played it for him.  All I know is that Nothing got in contact with me for the Nine Inch Nails remix and then expressed interest in releasing Drum 'N' Bass For Papa, so I guess I passed the test.\"  Nothing Records label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto (who likewise appeared with a remix on Nine Inch Nails' The Perfect Drug single) credited himself as having introduced Vibert's work to Reznor.  Dangers had been a fan of Vibert's, inviting him to remix Meat Beat Manifesto around the same time, on MBM's It's The Music single (under the Plug moniker) and the Original Fire EP (as Luke Vibert).  At the time, Vibert also had a standing offer from UK label Ninja Tune to re-issue the album.  Vibert ultimately opted to accept Reznor's offer with Nothing Records.", "Meat Beat Manifesto is one of the few acts to have seemingly left the label on good terms.  As late as 1997, Jack Dangers commented that \"I really appreciate Trent's willingness to put his money where his mouth is.  Not many people have had the guts to do this.  Everyone should know that Nothing have been incredibly supportive and they never try to manipulate my music.  What I give them, they release ... no pressure.  I have artistic freedom and support from a label that truly has their shit together. However, the band's departure from the label would amount to nothing more than their contract expiring.  All of the band's releases on Nothing Records were licensed via Play It Again Sam.  In 1999, the band's contract with PIAS expired, which in turn ended their licensing arrangement with Nothing Records.", "In the wake of their departure from Play It Again Sam, Jack Dangers would found his own label, Tino Corp., alongside frequent MBM members/collaborators Ben Stokes and Mike Powell.  There, Meat Beat Manifesto would release the Eccentric Objects EP on vinyl in 2000, as well as Storm The Studio RMXS in 2003, featuring remixes by DJ Spooky, Antipop Consortium, Jonah Sharp, Merzbow and more.", "In 2010, the band released their next studio album, Answers Come in Dreams.  The album's name is derived from a pair of remixes Jack Dangers did for Nothing Records label-mates Coil in 1991, for their E.P. The Snow.  The album was once again released in the U.S. on Metropolis Records, while the UK release was handled by the Hydrogen Dukebox label.", "Autechre arrived at Nothing via a licensing deal with their UK label, Warp Records, as part of a package which also included Warp acts Squarepusher and Plaid being picked up by the label.  Autechre is the duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth of Greater Manchester, England.  Their sound was considered pioneering within the electronic music scene, with their early work rooted in techno, house, electro and hip hop, while their later efforts ventured into more experimental soundscapes.  At the time, Warp was emerging as one of the premier labels for electronic music, with many of their acts being licensed to esteemed labels in the US, such as Sire (Aphex Twin, Jimi Tenor), Matador (Red Snapper, Two Lone Swordsmen) and Wax Trax! (Nightmares On Wax, Autechre).  These licensing deals, in addition to Warp's highly acclaimed Artificial Intelligence series, in which Autechre participated, would help cement both Warp Records and their rosters' global presence and influence. Nothing Records became the next in this revered line of labels to collaborate with Warp, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced many of the Warp acts' music to Trent Reznor.", "Also in 1997, the Big Loada EP was released on Warp.  By 1998, the Nothing deal had come into place and Squarepusher would receive his first licensing into the United States, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced his music to Trent Reznor.  Nothing decided to revisit the Big Loada EP and expand it into album length, adding on all tracks from the Port Rhombus EP and two tracks (\"Lone Ravers (Live In Chelmsford Mix)\" and \"The Barn (303 Kebab Mix)\") from Vic Acid.  The song \"Come On My Selector\" was also moved up to open the album, with a music video for the track directed by Chris Cunningham, which was included as a file on the Nothing edition, as an enhanced CD.

The Nothing version removed the track \"OI\" off the album, while adding on \"Undoneson\" and \"Spudink\" from the Undoneson single.  \"Undoneson\" and an exclusive remix, \"Abla Eedio (Freemix),\" also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation Nothing Changes, which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine."]}, {"page": "Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury", "response": ["*Jack Dangers\t - \tMixing"]}, {"page": "Coil (band)", "response": ["Love's Secret Domain (abbreviated LSD) followed in 1991 as the next \"proper\" Coil album, although a few minor releases had been produced since Horse Rotorvator.

The first release under the Meat Beat name was 1987's Suck Hard EP on Sweat Box Records.  They left Perennial Divide in 1988 to record a full Meat Beat album. The tapes of what would have been the debut MBM album were claimed to have been destroyed in a studio fire before it could be released (detailed in a publicity statement).  The former founder of Sweat Box Records (Rob Deacon) said that the fire never happened. Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview. The pair then recorded the LP Storm The Studio, which got them pigeonholed as an industrial act because Sweat Box Records sold the rights to the LP to Wax Trax Records for release in the United States. In response, they released 99% in May 1990, which was more techno-influenced and characterized by heavy beats and ubiquitous samples.

While Dangers had, in the past, flirted with jazz instrumentation and sampling on a handful of Meat Beat Manifesto tracks, At the Center was a marked variation of the expected MBM sound and was more of a one-off experiment than a whole new direction for the band. The album has been well received by many critics, with one reviewer calling it \"one of the best albums of the year in any genre.\" An EP of outtakes, live tracks and a remix titled Off-Centre was released shortly after.", "*Tapelab - more MBM/Jack Dangers material incl. unreleased and demo downloads"]}, {"page": "Armed Audio Warfare", "response": ["* Jack Dangers", "Category:Albums produced by Jack Dangers"]}, {"page": "Remixes 81\u201304", "response": ["# \"Rush\" (Spiritual Guidance Mix) \u2013 5:27 (Jack Dangers, 1993)"]}, {"page": "Bass flute", "response": ["In electronic music, Jack Dangers has sometimes used bass flute as the leader of the Meat Beat Manifesto."]}, {"page": "EMS Synthi 100", "response": ["The Synthi 100 owned by Jack Dangers can be heard being used extensively on electronica group Meat Beat Manifesto's album R.U.O.K.?.

Though the story was something of a rumour for many years, Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview.", "Rather than primarily use music as a source for samples and influence, Storm the Studio was influenced by television and uses numerous samples of television shows and news items. According to Adams, the band would occasionally \"get a track ready on the sampler so that we can sync that with the timecode, then the sampler is cued in so that when you play a record or tune in the television and as the track is running on, we can make samples which immediately go in time with the track.\" This allowed the band to capture certain television dialogue samples and edit them unit they were in sync with the track. One journalist noted that \"[t]he way in which Dangers and Adams generate samples incorporates a random element - this makes it stranger still that the samples seem so carefully chosen.\" Jack Dangers enjoyed sampling sources that much of their audience would recognise, hence the appearance of a sample of a Michael Jackson song.

Each of the four pieces are intended to fill one side of the double vinyl. Trouser Press wrote that the album stretches \"the concept of the remix further than most,\" finding few of the tracks on the album to sound similar to any of the record's other tracks, with Matthew Jeanes of Brainwashed echoing that \"most of the record works through free association to connect the dots.\" Describing its musical style, Trouser Press felt the album took \"the groundbreaking electronic grooves\" of Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle as its base and significantly toughened them up, sporadically adding raps in a stream-of-consciousness style. Band founder Jack Dangers explained: \"If you listen to Storm The Studio, there's vocals for all of the songs, but there are 4 different versions of each and not so many vocals on the other versions.\"", "\"Strap Down\" begins with drums that have been compared to machine guns and numerous loops that one reviewer felt \"[sound] like a marching band fighting with a circus over a breakbeat.\" Several minutes of bass bursts, changes in rhythm the repetition of the title phrase follow, followed thereafter by the drastically different, seven-minute second part of the piece, which keeps to a fast tempo. At the six-minute mark, this part is starkly altered by the introduction of a self-described \"annihilating rhythm.\" \"I Got the Fear\" repeats phrases from previous tracks, such as \"reanimate\" and \"re-animator\", turning the album \"into a kind of mobius strip of samples and themes\" in the words of Jeanes, who commented that \"If Jack Dangers isn't literally sampling himself here, he is quite figuratively doing it by recycling his own ideas from one track to the next without any regard for which sounds or ideas belong to which songs.\"", "Storm the Studio features artwork designed by the agency Accident, and was named after one of the album's samples, a clip of postmodernist writer William S.
