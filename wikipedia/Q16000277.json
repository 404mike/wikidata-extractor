They were even published by the same publisher\u2014Newnes for a while (before Price switched publishers to Robert Hale). At Newnes, both the series were illustrated by the same person - Thomas Henry. Books of the two series had comparable layouts - being hardbound copies with watercolour art on the jacket, art on the spine and the dust jacket spine, being collections of short stories illustrated in the hatch or crosshatch style.", "Three illustrators primarily illustrated the Jane books - for each of the publishing houses which published the Jane stories (John Hamilton, Newnes, and Robert Hale). Thomas Henry, the first illustrator of the William books, was the illustrator for Newnes, but did not depict Jane as the angelic girl with golden curls. The enduring image of Jane was due to the illustration of Frank R. Grey, who was with the publishing house of Robert Hale. It is worth noting that, even with the handover of Jane copyrights from publishing house to publishing house, the copyrights of the illustrations were not transferred. The first Jane book has thus been illustrated from scratch three times, and the second and third Jane books have been illustrated from scratch twice.", "*Thomas Henry - illustrator, website"]}, {"page": "Frank R.
