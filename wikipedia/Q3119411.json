Thanks to the fact that his C2 partner Richard Hounslow qualified for the K1 event, they were able to start together in the C2 event as the second British boat in that category.

He finished down in 10th place  which was a disappointment for him as well as the local fans. He and Hounslow (who also had a disappointing run in K1) made amends in the C2 event where they were able to win the silver medal behind their compatriots Tim Baillie and Etienne Stott and ahead of the three-time defending champions Pavol and Peter Hochschorner."]}, {"page": "2009 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships", "response": ["| Tim Baillie & Etienne StottDavid Florence & Richard HounslowDaniel Goddard & Colin Radmore || 117.20", "| Campbell WalshHuw SwetnamRichard Hounslow || 99.46"]}, {"page": "2010 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships", "response": ["| David FlorenceRichard Hounslow || 109.36"]}, {"page": "2011 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships", "response": ["| David Florence & Richard HounslowTim Baillie & Etienne StottRhys Davies & Matthew Lister || 129.51"]}]}}
