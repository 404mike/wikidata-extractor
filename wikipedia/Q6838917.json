Prior to the match, there had been considerable speculation over the future of Swindon's player-manager Hoddle who had been linked with Premiership clubs Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.  He was able to select a full-strength squad as he had been able to persuade the Australia national soccer team to release Mitchell from the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 OFC Second Round fixture against New Zealand.  Hoddle also selected Moncur, who had sustained bruised ribs against Tranmere, in preference to Micky Hazard.
