C. \"Nugget\" Coombs, also discussed with Oliphant a plan to create a new research institute that would attract the world's best scholars to Australia and lift the standard of university education nationwide. They hoped to start by attracting three of Australia's most distinguished expatriates: Oliphant, Howard Florey and Keith Hancock. It was academic suicide; Australia was far from the centres where the latest research was being carried out, and communications were much poorer at that time. But Oliphant accepted, and in 1950 returned to Australia as the first Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University. Within the school he created a Department of Particle Physics, which he headed himself, a Department of Nuclear Physics under Ernest Titterton, a Department of Geophysics under John Jaeger, a Department of Astronomy under Bart Bok, a Department of Theoretical Physics under Kenneth Le Couteur and a Department of Mathematics under Bernhard Neumann."]}, {"page": "Caroline Le Couteur", "response": ["Le Couteur grew up in the Canberra suburb of Yarralumla. Her father was the British physicist Kenneth Le Couteur. She was educated at Telopea Park High School and the Australian National University where she studied economics. She moved to Nimbin after the holding of the Aquarius Festival there in 1973 and stayed there for 11 years. While in Nimbin she was instrumental in forming a pre-school and primary school and became a solar (photovoltaic) panel retailer and installer. She subsequently moved back to Canberra and worked for the federal and territorial governments firstly in information technology and later in renewable energy policy.  She later became an Executive Director of locally based, now ASX listed, company Australian Ethical Investment as well as their information technology manager."]}, {"page": "Kenneth James Le Couteur", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Le Couteur"]}, {"page": "Le Couteur", "response": ["* Kenneth Le Couteur (1920\u20132011), British physicist"]}]}}
