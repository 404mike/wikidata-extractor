First, although anybody can stand on Speakers\u2019 Corner, in Parliament Square, or in Trafalgar Square and speak freely to a crowd,Generally the same laws apply to these places of free speech as in the whole country: see Redmond-Bate v DPP [2000] HRLR 249 (Speakers' Corner), Bailey v Williamson (1873) 8 QBD 118 (Hyde Park), and DPP v Haw [2007] EWHC 1931 (Admin). the communication channels with the biggest audiences are owned by large corporate entities:cf Leveson Report (2012\u201313) HC 779 discussing media concentration and competition. three internet media networks,In 2019, these were (1) Youtube and Google, owned by Alphabet, which is controlled by Larry Page and Sergey Brin (2) Facebook, controlled by Mark Zuckerberg, and (3) Twitter, controlled by Jack Dorsey. five television networks,In 2019, these were (1) the BBC, owned by an arms-length public corporation ultimately accountable to the UK government (2) Channel 4, a public corporation set up under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, (3) ITV, owned by asset managers such as Capital Group Companies, Ameriprise Financial and BlackRock (4) Channel 5, owned by Viacom Inc, where 80% of votes on shares are controlled by Sumner Redstone, and (5) Sky, owned by Comcast which is controlled by Brian L. Roberts. and six corporate owned newspaper groups,In 2019, the largest by website and circulation were (1) the Daily Mail, Metro and Evening Standard, largely owned by Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere through Daily Mail and General Trust plc, (2) The Times, and The Sun, controlled by Rupert Murdoch through Newscorp, (3) the Daily Mirror, Daily Express and Daily Star, controlled by Reach plc (4) the Guardian and the Observer, owned by Scott Trust Limited which has a board must guard editorial independence, but which appoints itself article 63, but this could be changed (for instance to include workers or readers) with 75% approval of directors under article 7, (5) the Daily Telegraph, controlled by the Barclay Brothers, and (6) The Independent and The i, controlled by Alexander Lebedev (who also has a majority stake with Lord Rothermere in the Evening Standard). almost all of which aim have shareholders that demand to make a profit.AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) 464, \u2018most newspapers are commercial enterprises whose first duty is one arising under private law to maximise shareholder return.\u2019 There is no formal legal duty to maximise shareholder returns under the Companies Act 2006 s 172, but in practice where shareholders monopolise votes to dismiss the board under CA 2006 s 168, this becomes the duty in practice, and the culture: see S Deakin, 'The Coming Transformation of Shareholder Value' (2005) 13(1) Corporate Governance 11. This means that most speech, with most reach, is designed to be compatible with generating advertising revenue and shareholder profit for the newspaper, TV, or internet corporation, and controllers choose which speech or images are acceptable, unless the law creates different rights. While there are loose limits on cross-ownership of TV and newspapers,Communications Act 2003 s 3 requires Ofcom to maintain 'sufficient plurality', s 391, requires regular review of media ownership by Ofcom, sent to Secretary of State, under the Broadcasting Act 1990 Sch 2, and CA 2003 Sch 14, para 1, states a person cannot hold a Channel 3 (ITV) licence if he runs a national newspaper/s with market share over 20% over a 6 month period. there is no regulation yet separate advertising business and internet media platforms where their interests conflict with public goals. The Communications Act 2003 sections 319\u2013321, regulates television (but not explicitly internet broadcasts, or newspapers) to ensure that diverse views are heard, and to restrict discriminatory viewing, or the stop misleading information, and allows a complaints procedure.This is detailed by the Ofcom, Broadcasting Code (2017). An Independent Press Standards Organisation operates for newspapers, see R (News Media Association) v Press Recognition Panel [2017] EWHC 2527, but this has no publicly accountable legal basis after the industry chose to boycott one. The UK's transparent, and publicly accountable system of TV media regulation is consistently held to be compatible with freedom of expression.e.g. R (Pro-Life Alliance) v BBC [2003] UKHL 23 finding that a ban on an anti-abortion group showing 'prolonged and deeply disturbing' images of an aborted foetus for a TV campaign advert did not violate ECHR article 10. cf R v Central Independent Television plc [1994] Fam 192 Two of the UK\u2019s TV networks, the BBC and Channel 4, are publicly owned and accountable, through an arm\u2019s length appointment process overseen by the government. However most television channels are funded through advertising revenue. There is also effectively no regulation of standards on internet media, although the House of Commons committee on fake news called for the same regulation as on TV to be applied after Facebook data theft and psychologically targeted political ads were used by \u2018Vote Leave\u2019 in the 2016 Brexit poll."]}, {"page": "4th Viscount Rothermere", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere"]}]}}
