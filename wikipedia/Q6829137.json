Entertainment channel, about Michael Carroll, as part of the E! True Hollywood Story series on lottery winners. In the film Jack Said (2009) Boru had a small part. Pete Doherty asked him to ghostwrite his autobiography in early 2009; after months of negotiations Boru declined the offer on the grounds that the model Kate Moss was concerned about her private life being exposed. After many emails from her lawyers, and talks with mutual friends of Moss, Boru made the decision to not proceed. In 2009 he was asked by film director Liam Galvin to play a part in the film Killer Bitch in which he played a porn film maker murdered by former football bad boy Jason Marriner. ", "Boru was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer (Hodgkins Lymphoma) in 1998, 2000 and 2002. He received radiotherapy the first 2 times, then chemotherapy. He filmed the second and third treatments with the intention to help other patients and their relatives to understand the procedures. During his 3rd treatment Boru wrote his autobiography as a private project for his children and grandchildren. His book No Sense of Tumour (June 2004) was published by Trafford Publishing. This led to him writing Careful what you wish For (2006), the biography of Michael Carroll, a 2002 British National Lottery winner of \u00a39.7m. The book was issued by John Blake Publishing in October 2006 (). Boru died on 14 February 2011.
