The monsoon had broken and floods impeded the Chindits' operations.

However, the Japanese reinforced the defenders of the town until it was held by a force of four battalions from the 53rd Division.Allen (1984), p.371 As Calvert's brigade tried to advance over flooded flat ground, they suffered severely from shortage of rations, exhaustion and disease. Finally, Calvert was reinforced by a Chinese battalion and put in an all-out assault on 24 June which captured almost all of the town.Allen, p.373-374 The last resistance was cleared by 27 June.

Giffard would not overrule Slim, but he did inform the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS, the professional head of the British Army), Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, that Symes' supersession was due to the unique requirements of Chindit operations and not a reflection on his ability as a commander.

The aim was to harass the Japanese rear and supply lines as well as to relieve pressure on American General Vinegar 'Joe' Stilwell's joint Chinese and US forces moving south into Northern Burma who were intending to take the strategic town of Myitkyina. The early operations of the Chindits were marred by the death of Wingate in an air crash. They then went under the command of Major General Walter Lentaigne but were eventually placed under the command of the Anglophobe Stilwell. By that time, the 77th Brigade had been in action since early March, having held off superior Japanese forces for two months from their stronghold of White City."]}]}}
