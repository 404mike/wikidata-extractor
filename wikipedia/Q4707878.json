Bryan Ferry added hummed backing vocals to the song. The record made Richard the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 40 in the 1980s who had also been there in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile, which was re-titled We Don't Talk Anymore for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years, and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world.

Lodge made a defining shift in his songwriting on this album, leaving his trademark high-energy rock music, and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as \"Lean on Me (Tonight)\" (though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as \"Emily's Song\" for his daughter in 1971, \"Survival\" in 1978, and \"Talking Out of Turn\" in 1981), while his more powerful songs continued with \"Magic\" and the Lennonesque \"Shadows on the Wall\". This gentler trend continued on the two successive Moodies albums. Hayward wrote the driving two-part piece \"Say What You Mean.\" Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on \"Keys\", as did Christopher Neil and Alan Tarney.
