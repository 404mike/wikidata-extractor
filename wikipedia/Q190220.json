It is comparable to the original meaning of Greek  of \"rejecting the gods, rejected by the gods, godforsaken\".

The main literary figures in his study are Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Swinburne, Zora Neale Hurston, Rebecca West, Elie Wiesel, Peter Shaffer, and Philip Pullman. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium for the expression of God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism, while ingeneously veiling their blasphemy.Bernard Schweizer, Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism (2010).", "By the 1970s, Harlan Ellison even described dystheism as a bit of a science fiction clich\u00e9.
