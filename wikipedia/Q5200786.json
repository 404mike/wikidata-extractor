In 1936\u201337 he formed a useful partnership with fellow half-backs Bill Kennedy and Cyril King and only missed one game, although Southampton struggled near the bottom of the Second Division. He briefly became team captain until, in September 1937, new manager Tom Parker acquired the services of Scottish international Frank Hill, who had won the Football League title three times with Arsenal (in 1932\u201333, 1933\u201334 and 1934\u201335). Hill immediately took over both the captaincy and Bill's No. 6 shirt, and after Hill's arrival, Kingdon only made one further appearance, and in January 1938 joined Yeovil & Petters United as player-manager."]}, {"page": "Bill Kennedy (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["In August 1936 he was one of several players signed by Southampton manager George Goss as he attempted to rebuild the team that had struggled for several years in the Second Division. Kennedy formed a useful partnership with fellow half-backs Cyril King and Billy Kingdon, but once again the Saints struggled to avoid relegation, finishing 19th in the table. Described by Saints historians Holley & Chalk as \"a reliable centre-half\" he retained his place at the start of the following season before being replaced by David Affleck at the end of September, as new manager Tom Parker re-organised the side following a run of seven games at the start of the season in which Saints lost four and drew three. He spent most of the rest of the season in the reserves, although he was drafted in as an inside forward for the final two games of the season, replacing Ted Bates. In May 1938 he refused a new contract and moved back to Scotland."]}, {"page": "Alf Day", "response": ["At The Dell, Day took over from Cyril King for the first half of the 1937\u201338 season before King returned in December.  Day was described as \"a calm, neat player who specialised in the ground pass rather than the cleared high ball\", he had solid defensive qualities, but tended to \"dwell on the ball\" and \"his thoughtful distribution was sometimes marred by his being caught in possession\". Day was never fully appreciated by the Dell crowd and moved on to Tranmere Rovers after 12 months."]}, {"page": "Ray Parkin (footballer)", "response": ["The following season, Parkin was moved to right half to replace Cyril King, retaining his place for the rest of the season. In September 1939, he played twice before the Football League was abandoned for the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Bobby Whitelaw", "response": ["Whitelaw was signed by Southampton's new manager George Goss as a replacement for the recently retired Stan Woodhouse. His debut for the Saints came on 5 September 1936, in the first Second Division match played at Villa Park, which ended in a 4\u20130 defeat. Whitelaw retained his place at right-half in the Southampton team, where he combined well with fellow half-backs, Bill Kennedy and Billy Kingdon, until December when he lost his place to Cyril King. Although he made one further appearance at the end of the season, he was not offered a new contract and left the club in May 1937, winding up his career at non-league Kidderminster Harriers."]}, {"page": "List of Southampton F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["Since the club's formation, a total of 341 players have made between 25 and 99 appearances for Southampton.

The first arrival was goalkeeper Billy Light, who joined from Harland and Wolff on amateur terms and did not turn professional until more than a year later. Outside-right Fred Dunmore was signed for the reserve team from Derby County in June, when Accrington Stanley goalkeeper Bob Foster was also signed. Winger Jimmy Harris joined from West Ham United in July, followed by centre-forward Norman Cole from Newport (Isle of Wight) in August. After the season had started, inside-left Tom Ruddy was signed from Chesterfield. Also in September, Willie Haines was sold to Weymouth, George Harkus joined Southport as reserve player-coach, and Sid Grover signed for Bournemouth Gasworks Athletic. Half-back Cyril King signed from Plymouth United on amateur terms in November. In February, with the club still suffering financial problems, Fulham bought outside-left Johnny Arnold and left-back Michael Keeping for a combined fee of \u00a35,100. After the arrival of Keeping, Fulham sent regular left-back Arthur Tilford in return to Southampton on a temporary basis.", "!scope=\"row\"|Cyril King"]}]}}
