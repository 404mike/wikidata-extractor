The first known report of this genus was in 1854 when patients in Paris showed infection by a parasitic flagellate. The human parasite was classified under the name of Cercomonas hominis var. 1 by Davaine (1854). In 1910, it was reclassified as its own species and named Macrostoma mesnili by Charles Morley Wenyon, an English protozoologist. It was again renamed to Chilomastix davainei (syn. Chilomastix mesnili) in 1920 by Kofoid. The origin of the name Chilomastix however, was before 1920. The initial proposal of Chilomastix being its own genus was urged by Alexeieffe in 1912 who was the first to thoroughly describe a species belonging to this genus. Although he initially called it Tetramitus caulleryi in 1910, he then referred it is as its own genus, Chilomastix in 1912.
