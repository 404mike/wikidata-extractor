Philosophy was still a male-dominated subject when Hogarth wished to study it, so that she was forced to petition the men's lecture courses for access. Benjamin Jowett agreed to allow her to join classes at Balliol College, where she joined lectures on the pre-Socratics given by Richard Lewis Nettleship. She had to sit at the High Table, away from the audience of male undergraduates, and was sometimes accompanied by Elizabeth Wordsworth as a chaperone, who could be heard disagreeing with the lecturer. Following the Nettleship lecturers New College gave permission for Hogarth to attend lectures on Plato given by William Leonard Courtney, who would support her education by interceding with other lectures on her behalf, and later become her husband."]}, {"page": "Martin Shaw (composer)", "response": ["*1936 Would it were So (Elizabeth Wordsworth) [Unison] \u2013 Novello"]}, {"page": "Wordsworth (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Dame Elizabeth Wordsworth, (1840\u20131932), founder of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and St. Hugh's College, daughter of Christopher Wordsworth"]}, {"page": "List of Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*1928: The Duchess of Bedford, Frances Dove, Eadith Walker, Elizabeth Wordsworth"]}, {"page": "Eleanor Lodge", "response": ["She studied History at Lady Margaret Hall until 1894.
