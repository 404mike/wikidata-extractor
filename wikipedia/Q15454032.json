The character first appeared on-screen during the episode broadcast on 25 June 1987. Hilary departed the show on 28 February 1990, following Scott-Pendlebury's decision to quit in 1989. Scott-Pendlebury reprised her role in 2005 for the serial's 20th anniversary episode, and again in February 2015 ahead of the 30th anniversary. Writers established that Hilary is back living in Erinsborough, so she can continue to make sporadic appearances. She is characterised as a bossy and meddling woman who lacks romance and seeks comfort interfering with her Neighbours' personal lives. Hilary's main storyline was mothering an illegitimate child Matt Robinson (Ashley Paske). He arrives in Erinsborough to forge a relationship with his birth mother. The character's \"hard-edged approach to life\" mellowed during the storyline.", "In Neighbours: The Official Annual 1991, John McCready and Nicola Furlong said that Sharon Davies (Jessica Muschamp) never got any peace and tranquillity when Hilary was around. They also said Scott-Pendlebury had made a mark on Neighbours. The Evening Times said Hilary \"is the tactless cousin of The Robinson family who despite all her faults did bring Beverly and Jim together.\" A writer from Inside Soap branded Hilary Ramsay Street's \"strait-laced resident\". In 2015, a TV Week columnist praised Hilary's return and wrote \"here's to you, Hilary Robinson.  Yep, she's back! Older Neighbours fans will get a real kick out of seeing Hilary (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) once more. They'll remember her as the bossy, meddling, do-gooder cousin of Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis).\" A Coventry Evening Telegraph reporter branded Hilary \"irritating\". Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy branded Hilary a \"interfering\" character.", "* Hilary Robinson at the Official AU Neighbours website", "* Hilary Robinson at Neighbours.com"]}, {"page": "List of Manx people", "response": ["*Hilary Robinson (born 1972), children's author"]}, {"page": "Hilary robinson children's author", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hilary Robinson (author)"]}, {"page": "Turn Your Radio On", "response": ["* Turn Your Radio On, a 2008 BBC radio documentary produced by Hilary Robinson"]}, {"page": "Mercy dog", "response": ["A historical fiction book, Darling, Mercy Dog by Alison Hart, was published in 2013.
