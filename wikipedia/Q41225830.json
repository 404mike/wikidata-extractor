When film actor Christopher Lambert turned down an offer to reprise the role of Connor for the series, the producers decided to simply recast the role. Adrian Paul auditioned and was cast but then suggested that since Lambert's portrayal of Connor was popular with fans it would be better to create a new character rather than try to replace him. The production agreed that doing this would allow the show more freedom to create its own hero and so it was decided that Adrian Paul would now be playing Connor's student and kinsman Duncan MacLeod.
