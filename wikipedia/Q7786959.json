If he accepted the amendment, he would be seen as abandoning the Irish Unionists, but on the other hand if the amendment was carried it might disrupt the government by causing a split between the Liberals and Irish Nationalists, bringing down the government and thus forcing an election.Adams (1999) p. 112"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: A", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" |Thomas Agar-Robartes", "|Thomas Agar-Robartes,", "|Thomas Agar-Robartes"]}, {"page": "Lanhydrock House", "response": ["The Robartes family declined significantly during the First World War, including the heir Thomas Agar-Robartes MP, who was killed during the Battle of Loos in France, while trying to rescue a colleague from no-man's land.

I wasn't originally claiming that Cornwall should be listed with all the countries. I originally put it under the United Kingdom in the brackets with England Scotland and Wales. What I would say though is that the definition given by Fram of what constitutes a country does allow for Cornwall to be included like Wales is. \"A country or territory is a geographical area, either in the sense of nation (a cultural entity) and/or state (a political entity).\" and \"Nation may refer to a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history. However, it can also refer to people who share a common territory and government (for example the inhabitants of a sovereign state) irrespective of their ethnic make-up; that is, a nation state.\" Indeed Cornwall and the Cornish people were referred to as a nation or country during the 16th and 17th century. People who have explicitly referred to Cornwall in such a way include: Thomas Agar-Robartes MP, 1910; Peter Bessell MP and John Pardoe MP, 1967; Charles Lee (author) 1898; D. H. Lawrence; Ludovico Falier, Venetian ambassador, 1531; Girolamo Ruscelli, 1561; George Lily, 1546; Johannes Honter; Polydore Vergil, official historian of Henry VII and VIII; Sebastian M\u00fcnster, 1538; Francis Bacon, 1622; Robert Louis Stevenson; John Betjeman; and A. L. Rowse. There are also the 83,966 who stated their national identity as Cornish in the United Kingdom Census 2011 and the 41% of school children registering their ethnic identity as Cornish in the same year. There are also several thousand people who speak the Cornish language. So there's definitely \"a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history.\" which means that there's a \"nation (a cultural entity)\" which is one of the two definitions of Country that Wikipedia lists.
