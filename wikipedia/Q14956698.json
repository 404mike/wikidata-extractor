Michael said \"Stephen Doughty\u2019s father and I first met 40 years ago when I was a youth worker and he was involved with an Army youth group. I have known Stephen since he was a baby\". When Alun Michael announced his decision to step down as Cardiff South and Penarth MP in order to stand for election as South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, the Western Mail reported on 13 July 2012 that Michael had been \"interfering inappropriately\" in Labour's selection process for his putative successor in the constituency in order to ensure his preferred candidate (Stephen Doughty) was included on the shortlist. Michael subsequently admitted that he had indeed spoken personally to Labour leader Ed Miliband, to the party's general secretary Iain McNicol and to members of the National Executive Committee, with the purpose of \"preventing a stitch-up\" and \"stopping a candidate from outside being imposed on the local party\". After Michael's intervention Doughty's name was included in the final short list along with four other candidates, Kate Groucutt, Karen Wilkie, Nick Thomas-Symonds and Jeremy Miles. Doughty was selected in a vote by constituency Labour Party members on 14 July 2012.", "In December 2015 Stephen Doughty made the decision to support air strikes against Syria, a decision for which he was criticised by many of his constituents and political activists via social media. Mr Doughty called the police to deal with the 'personal threats' he had received."]}]}}
