In the words of Richard William Church, it was \"Keble who inspired, Froude who gave the impetus, and Newman who took up the work\"; but the first organisation of it was due to Hugh James Rose, editor of the British Magazine, who has been styled \"the Cambridge originator of the Oxford Movement\". Rose met Oxford Movement figures on a visit to Oxford looking for magazine contributors, and it was in his rectory house at Hadleigh, Suffolk, that a meeting of High Church clergy was held over 25\u201326 July (Newman was not present, but Hurrell Froude, Arthur Philip Perceval, and William Palmer had gone to visit Rose), at which it was resolved to fight for \"the apostolical succession and the integrity of the Prayer Book\"."]}, {"page": "1890 in literature", "response": ["*December 6 \u2013 Richard William Church, English biographer and cleric (born 1815)"]}, {"page": "1870 in literature", "response": ["*Richard William Church \u2013 Life of St. Anselm"]}, {"page": "1815 in literature", "response": ["*April 25 \u2013 Richard William Church, English biographer and cleric (died 1890)"]}, {"page": "Oxford Movement", "response": ["*Richard William Church"]}, {"page": "Metaphysical Society", "response": ["*Richard William Church"]}, {"page": "Richard Church (general)", "response": ["He was the uncle of English churchman and writer Richard William Church."]}, {"page": "Dean of St Paul's", "response": ["|Richard William Church"]}, {"page": "Richard Church", "response": ["*Richard William Church (1815\u20131890), nephew of the general, Dean of St Paul's"]}, {"page": "Richard Church (dean)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard William Church"]}, {"page": "Accommodation (religion)", "response": ["German eighteenth-century rationalism held that the Biblical writers made great use of conscious accommodation, intending moral commonplaces when they seemed to be enunciating Christian dogmas.

He stood down as editor in 1883 and was replaced by Daniel Conner Lathbury. His outspoken views on political and ecclesiastical matters, and especially his opposition to the Boer War, led to his dismissal in 1899.
