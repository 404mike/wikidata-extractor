Although he was educated in the field of mathematics and computer science, his personal obsession with baroque music led him to pursue scholarly music research in his spare time. What began as more or less a hobby developed into a highly distinguished para-career as a historian and writer. He became one of the leading 20th-century scholars on George Frideric Handel.As a music critic, Hicks wrote for Early Music Review and The Musical Times. For the 2001 edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, he penned Handel's biography and several other Handel related entries. He also authored most of the Handel related articles in the New Grove Dictionary of Opera.  He became an important advocate for historically informed performances just as the renewed enthusiasm for baroque music began to take off in the 1960s and 1970s. His research has been used widely in preparing baroque works for recordings and performance; most notably with the Academy of Ancient Music with whom he worked closely for several decades. Musicians with whom Hicks collaborated on recordings were Christopher Hogwood, Paul McCreesh, Robert King, Trevor Pinnock, Emma Kirkby, John Eliot Gardiner, and Alan Curtis among many other distinguished baroque performers. He died at the age of 66 in London in 2010 of pulmonary fibrosis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Frideric Handel", "response": ["In 1712, Handel decided to settle permanently in England.

As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \"trumpet\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending.Hicks, pp. 10\u201311 In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \"ascending fourth\"  as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \"I know that my Redeemer liveth\" and on numerous other occasions. Nevertheless, Luckett finds this thesis implausible, and asserts that \"the unity of Messiah is a consequence of nothing more arcane than the quality of Handel's attention to his text, and the consistency of his musical imagination\".Luckett, pp. 88\u201389 Allan Kozinn, The New York Times music critic, finds \"a model marriage of music and text\u00a0...

They were remembered and written down by William Babell, and published later as separate pieces. Lang believes that in spite of the borrowings, and the hasty manner in which the work was put together, Rinaldo is one of Handel's great operas. According to Dean and Knapp, no Italian opera heard in London to that point had been supported by such \"majestic\" orchestral forces. Critic Anthony Hicks describes the music, overall, as both \"varied and excellent\". Dean and Knapp's verdict is more equivocal. The music for the war and pageantry scenes, they say, is \"brilliantly successful\", but in depicting the scenes concerned with magic, Handel misses the mark; they suggest it was not until over 15 years later, with Admeto and Orlando, that he was able to represent the supernatural convincingly in music."]}, {"page": "Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow", "response": ["Zachow probably received his training from his father, the piper Heinrich Zachow, one of Leipzig's town musicians in the Alta capella, and maybe from Johann Schelle, a leading German composer, when the family moved to Eilenburg.Zachow, Friedrich Wilhelm As Kantor and organist of Halle's Market Church in 1684 he succeeded Samuel Ebart.

The role of Oberto in Alcina was specially composed with his voice in mind and was added to the score at a later time in order just to cast him. Parvopassu, Clelia, Alcina, in Gelli, Piero & Poletti, Filippo (ed), Dizionario dell'opera 2008, Milan, Baldini Castoldi Dalai, 2007, p. 41,  (reproduced online at Opera Manager). After his voice had broken, he initially continued his career singing as an alto (countertenor), and later turned into a bass. As a countertenor he performed possibly the small roles of La Fortuna and Childerico in Handel's operas, Giustino (1737) and Faramondo (1738),Grove. Savage's countertenor performing the role of Childerico is also stated by Hogwood (p. 146). According to the English conductor, \"the countertenor voice was not typical of opera seria and Savage perhaps took the small soprano part of Childerico because of the problems [impresario] Heidegger encountered in casting it. It is certainly no historical precedent; in a similar dilemma Handel would normally have transposed or transferred a castrato part to a female singer\". According to Anthony Hicks, however, the role of the goddess Fortuna was instead his last appearance as a treble, while the minor soprano part of Childerico, which has no arias, was probably sung an octave lower than written, having Savage's voice just broken (articles: Giustino (ii) and Faramondo, in Stanley Sadie (ed), The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, New York, Oxford University Press, 1997, II, pp. 121 e 440\u2013441). and also appeared in the first performance of  Israel in Egypt (1739), as well as in revivals of other Handel oratorios.The information for these performances and their dates comes from http://gfhandel.org/. As a bass, he created the title role in Imeneo (1740), the role of Fenice in Deidamia (1741)Burrows. and that of Manoa at the premiere of the oratorio Samson (1743). The 18th-century musicologist Charles Burney described Savage's voice as a \"powerful and not unpleasant bass\". The description of his pupil R. J. S. Stevens is more complimentary: he describes Savage as possessing \"a pleasant voice of two octaves\", and details that Savage sang with \"clear articulation, perfect intonation, great volubility of voice, and chaste and good expression\"."]}, {"page": "Hicks", "response": ["* Anthony Hicks (1943\u20132010), Welsh musicologist, music critic, editor, and writer"]}, {"page": "Flute sonata in G major (HWV 363b)", "response": ["The Flute sonata in G major (HWV 363b) was composed (c. 1711\u201316) by George Frideric Handel in F major for the oboe, and was transposed by an unknown hand to G major, for flute and basso continuo.
