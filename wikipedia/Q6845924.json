The assessment of Velikovsky's work by tree-ring expert Mike Baillie is instructive: \"But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets \u2026 As if to comfort his readers, at one point he says that no planet at present has a course which poses a danger to this planet: '\u2026only a few asteroids\u2014mere rocks, a few kilometres in diameter\u2014have orbits which cross the path of the earth.' \u2026 He did not know about the hazard posed by relatively small objects, and, just in case there is any doubt about his mistake, he repeats the notion by noting that a possibility exists of some future collision between planets, 'not a mere encounter between a planet and an asteroid'. This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth.\""]}, {"page": "David Keys", "response": ["Keys' book Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of the Modern World (2000) theorizes that a natural disaster caused changes during the 6th and 7th centuries in the whole world, including Christian territories, that contributed to the end of ancient civilization and initiated what is now known as the medieval era. Key's work expands on that by Mike Baillie in Exodus to Arthur: catastrophic encounters with comets (1999) in which the primary evidence for the event is dendochronology (shown by narrow rings around c. 540 CE), as well as acidity in Greenlandic ice cores (suggesting volcanic activity), as well as accounts of historians such as John of Ephesus, Procopius, and Cassiodorus on changes in climate, including dimming of the sun. Keys adds further information from East Asia and develops his own version of the theory; he attributes the changes to a volcanic event in East Asia, in 535 AD, possible at Krakatoa."]}, {"page": "Baillie (surname)", "response": ["*Mike Baillie, Professor of Palaeoecology at Queen's University of Belfast"]}, {"page": "Hallstatt plateau", "response": ["  Peter James cites Mike Baillie (who developed Irish oak dendrochronology): \"The immediate conclusion is that it is impossible to sensibly resolve the radiocarbon dates of any samples whose true ages lie between 400 and 800 BC.
