Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346863/ before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2-D due to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release. The film earned an estimated $2.7 million in North American box office sales in 1954.", "* John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard", "\"This is a technical triumph that Hitchcock has achieved,\" wrote Bosley Crowther of The New York Times in a favourable review. \"It is one for which he needed good actors. He has them\u2014and the best of the lot is John Williams, late of the stage play, who is the detective who solves the sinister ruse.\" Variety wrote: \"There are a number of basic weaknesses in the set-up that keep the picture from being a good suspense show for any but the most gullible. Via the performances and several suspense tricks expected of Hitchcock, the weaknesses are glossed over to some extent but not enough to rate the film a cinch winner.\" Harrison's Reports wrote that the film \"shapes up as no more than a mild entertainment, despite the expert direction of Hitchcock and the competent acting of the players. The chief weakness is that the action is slow, caused by the fact that the story unfolds almost entirely by dialogue.\"", "Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \"completely choice,\" with Williams and Dawson \"smooth as silk in reprising their stage roles,\" adding, \"Hitch has a field day with his camera angles, darting our eyes now here, now there, doing tingling tricks with shadows and long longshots in quick contrast to fuzzed close-ups. It's the work of a master enjoying his script.\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote a generally positive review, writing that he wished the script would give Hitchcock \"a chance to cut loose with one of those spectacular chases he used to specialise in,\" but finding that after a talky opening 30 minutes, \"things speed up once the murder wheels are set in motion, and eventually the piece becomes grimly diverting.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the film \"offers the prolific Hitchcock little more than an opportunity to carpenter a neat piece of filmed theatre\u2014an opportunity which perhaps satisfied the master a little more than it does us ... The characters are fitted to their situations, and hardly exist in themselves (nor are they enlivened by the rather drab performances of Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings); only John Williams' dry, sardonic police inspector has a touch of individuality.\""]}, {"page": "John Williams (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Williams (born 1932) is an American composer (specializing in
