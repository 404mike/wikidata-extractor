In being portrayed as both arrogant, moralistic and a political activist, he differed from the other characters in the soap opera, predominantly working-class like himself. The character developed a reputation as a ladies' man; plots saw Ken using underhanded tactics to boost his prospects in an election, dating numerous women, marrying four times to three women (Valerie Tatlock in 1962, Janet Reid in 1972, Deirdre Hunt in 1981 and again in 2005), fathering four children with three women (Lawrence Cunningham in 1961 from Ken's affair with Susan Cunningham \u2013 though he never knew about Lawrence until 2010 \u2013 twins Susan Barlow and Peter Barlow in 1965 from Ken's marriage to Valerie Tatlock, and in 1995 Daniel Osbourne from Ken's affair with Denise Osbourne), as well as later adopting Deirdre's daughter Tracy Barlow. Of the many women Ken has been paired with, his relationship with Deirdre has been the most enduring. Ken and Deirdre's fictional relationship made newspaper headlines in Britain in 1983, due to Deirdre's adultery with Mike Baldwin. The storyline captured both media and viewer interest: 20 million people tuned in to watch Ken's discovery of the affair. The storyline led to a feud between Ken and Mike, prominent in both characters' narratives until Mike's screen death in 2006.
