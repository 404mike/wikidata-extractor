As the series shifts from being a superhero pastiche to be more wrestling focused, The Choujins's role also evolves from being superheroes to being superhuman wrestlers.

The most popular and exemplary Justice Choujins are known as the Idol Choujins, which makes up the principal cast of protagonists.
