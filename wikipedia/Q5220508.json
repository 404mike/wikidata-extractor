Marr was exhausted and took a break from the band in June 1987, which he felt was negatively perceived by his bandmates. In July, he left the group because he erroneously believed an NME article entitled \"Smiths to Split\" was planted by Morrissey.Johnny Rogan, Morrissey and Marr: The Severed Alliance (London: Omnibus, 1992), pp.\u00a0281\u2013282. The article, written by Danny Kelly, alleged that Morrissey disliked Marr working with other musicians and that Marr and Morrissey's personal relationship had reached a breaking point. Marr contacted NME to explain that he had not left the band due to personal tensions but because he wanted wider musical scope.\"Marr Speaks\", NME, 8 August 1987.

Initially, NME writers themselves were ill at ease with the new regime, with most signing a letter of no confidence in Lewis shortly after he took over. However, this new direction for the NME proved to be a commercial success and the paper brought in new writers such as Andrew Collins, Andrew Harrison, Stuart Maconie, Mary Anne Hobbs and Steve Lamacq to give it a stronger identity and sense of direction. Lewis prioritised readership over editorial independence, and Mark Sinker left in 1988 after Lewis refused to print his unfavourable review of U2's Rattle and Hum (\"the worst album by a major band in years\"), replacing it with a glowing Stuart Baillie review intended to be more acceptable to readers. Initially many of the bands on the C86 tape were championed as well as the rise of gothic rock bands but new bands such as the Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses were coming out of Manchester. One scene over these years was Acid House which spawned \"Madchester\" which helped give the paper a new lease of life. By the end of the decade, Danny Kelly had replaced Lewis as editor.", "Later in 1992, Steve Sutherland, previously an assistant editor of Melody Maker, was brought in as the NMEs editor to replace Danny Kelly.

In 2003, it was placed at number 113 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 115 in a 2012 revised list, and 316 on the 2020 list. Mark Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), called it Townshend's first and best concept album and said that he \"successfully does what he would overdo\" in Tommy and Quadrophenia: \"There's no fixed narrative to take away from the music. And the music is sensational\". In 2007, Rolling Stone included it on their list of the 40 essential albums of 1967 and stated, \"the Who's finest album exemplifies how pop this famously psychedelic year was.\" The album was reissued in 2009 as a two-disc deluxe edition, which Danny Kelly of Uncut magazine said was the \"definitive\" release of the Who's most \"entertaining\" and \"endearing\" album. In his review for eMusic, Lenny Kaye said that The Who Sell Out is a \"classic of prophetic pop art\" because of \"the concept of branding that has taken the place of record label patronage these days\"."]}, {"page": "Manic Street Preachers", "response": ["Their next single, \"You Love Us\", sampled Krzysztof Penderecki's \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\" as well as Iggy Pop.

He was taken to hospital and received seventeen stitches. NME subsequently ran a full-page story on the incident, including a phone interview with Richey on his motivations for doing it. A recording of the editorial meeting discussing whether or not they could publish the image was included as a b-side on the band's 1992 charity single Theme from M.A.S.H.

I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling\". During the following US tour, Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. According to critic Mark Kemp; \"After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over.\" The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme white noise played during \"You Made Me Realise\".

Erlewine of AllMusic mentioned the album did not \"surprise or offer anything that wasn't already on The Chronic\".

David Browne spoke of \"Ain't No Fun\", stating it was an example of how \"musically artful, yet lyrically repellent, this album can be\" and went on to say \"It's easy to be impressed one moment and appalled the next\". Renowned rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album a \"dud\" rating, which signifies \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible.\" Q's Danny Kelly observed: \"Snoop Doggy Dogg's record is more or less a 19-track homage to/gleeful rip off of George Clinton's 'Atomic Dog'\u00a0... It's inclined to become a touch unimaginative; a tad, let's be honest, dull\u00a0...
