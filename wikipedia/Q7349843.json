Alloa fell behind to a Paul Dalglish penalty before half time but rallied in the second half with great goals from Robert Sloan and Ross Hamilton to win 2\u20131. Maitland then needed to turn this kind of gritty performance to the league to save Alloa from relegation. He managed to steer the club to a ninth-place finish meaning entry into the playoffs to decide relegation from/promotion to the Scottish Second Division. Alloa met Arbroath in the semi-final where they won through 2\u20131 on aggregate. This meant a play-off final showdown with Berwick Rangers. Alloa basically put the tie out of Berwick's reach with a 4\u20130 home win in the first leg; the 2\u20131 Berwick win in the return fixture ensured Alloa's Second Division future."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 East Fife F.C. season", "response": ["||| MF|| Robert Sloan"]}, {"page": "List of Alloa Athletic F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Robert Sloan"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 East Fife F.C. season", "response": ["|||MF||Robert Sloan"]}, {"page": "Sloan, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Sloan"]}]}}
