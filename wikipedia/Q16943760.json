He was Professor of History at the University College of South Wales, Cardiff, between 1898 and 1901 (having previously been the college's first history lecturer there since 1892). He was thereafter a visiting lecturer (1903\u201320) and then reader (1920\u201332)  in palaeography at the University of Manchester. He was president of the Historical Association from 1926 to 1929, and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1922.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lanercost Chronicle", "response": ["The English historian Andrew George Little concluded that the chronicle is basically a Franciscan chronicle, which has been adapted, abbreviated, and interpolated at the Augustinian Lanercost Priory. He was able to identify the Chronicle up to 1297 as a version of a lost chronicle of 'Richard of Durham'; after that he believed a different author (with a keen interest in siege equipment and operations) to be responsible, whom he suspected to have been 'Thomas of Otterburn' whose chronicle is mentioned in the Scalachronica.  The second author, says Little, \"resembles the first only in being a Franciscan and a patriotic hater of the Scots\" but an additional similarity is that they are both North-country men.  Where most other chroniclers are unclear on the geography of the Borders, the Lanercost Chronicle gives the name of the farmstead at which the Scots reached Tynedale in 1346.
