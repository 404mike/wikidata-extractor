The new caps included professionals George Toone of Notts County in goal, Henry Lilley of Sheffield United (making his only England appearance at left-back) and George Kinsey (Wolverhampton Wanderers) at left-half. Joe Schofield a Staffordshire schoolteacher with Stoke City played at outside-left. The other d\u00e9butantes were Anthony Hossack (Corinthian), William Winckworth (Old Westminsters), Robert Cunliffe Gosling (Old Etonians) and Rupert Sandilands (Old Westminsters).

England selected a much more experienced team than for the Wales and Ireland games, and only included four players who had featured in those games, including only one of the debutantes, George Toone in goal. Jack Reynolds, the West Bromwich Albion full-back, was selected to play for England for the first time, even though he had previously played five international games for Ireland, having scored against England on 15 March 1890. It had wrongly been assumed that Reynolds was born in Ireland; however, his birth certificate had proved that he was in fact born in Blackburn, thereby enabling him to make eight appearances for England. England rattled in four goals in the first 21 minutes, and although Scotland scored a late consolation goal, England were able to continue their excellent run of results against the Scots and claim the championship again."]}, {"page": "1894 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|GK || 1 ||George Toone"]}, {"page": "Jim Cassidy (footballer)", "response": ["Cassidy also scored Bolton's consolation goal in the 1894 FA Cup Final - Bolton were 4-0 down to Notts County when, with three minutes to play, County's goalkeeper George Toone came out to meet a Bolton attack only to slip while attempting to clear and leave Cassidy with one of the easiest cup final goals of all time."]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|George Toone"]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["A gale damaged the roof of the grandstand at the Coventry Road ground;\"What we hear\".
