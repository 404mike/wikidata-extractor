Throughout his tenure on the breakfast show, which was based on a \"zoo\" format, Mayo was joined by news anchor Rod McKenzie and by a sidekick weather and travel presenter - Carol Dooley then Sybil Ruscoe, Jackie Brambles, and the late Dianne Oxberry.

Many assumed this would be a quiet end to his career but he turned the station from a declining backwater to the most popular in the UK, winning back many former Radio 1 listeners who had defected to commercial radio. This was achieved through broadcasters like Steve Wright, Johnnie Walker, Janice Long, Paul Gambaccini, Lynn Parsons, Bob Harris and Alan Freeman, all of whom joined Radio 2 during Moir's controllership."]}, {"page": "Bob Harris (radio presenter)", "response": ["Harris left Radio 1 in October 1993 as he, along with many other Radio 1 DJs, was felt not to fit in with the changes being made by new controller Matthew Bannister.

When Dianne is away Jackie Brambles, Caron Keating, Lynn Parsons, and Philippa Forrester would stand in as weather and travel presenters, and Peter Bowes would stand in as newsreader when Rod is away, and Philip Schofield, Bruno Brookes, and Mark Goodier would stand in as breakfast show host when Simon is away.
