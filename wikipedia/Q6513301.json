Arsenal then played out a draw against Barnet, where trialist Yaya Tour\u00e9 \u2013 the brother of Kolo, was included in the team. In a 2011 interview, Wenger recalled Yaya's performance as being \"completely average on the day\" and noted his impatience stopped him from joining Arsenal; Tour\u00e9 went on to play for Barcelona before joining Manchester City in 2010. Arsenal undertook a tour in Austria, a year after crowd troubles forced their match in Eisenstadt to be abandoned. Wenger was absent with a stomach upset so assistant manager Pat Rice took charge of Arsenal against SC Ritzing on 22 July 2003; the team came from two goals down to draw their second consecutive friendly. Rice was pleased with Philippe Senderos' cameo in defence and said: \"Still some rough edges but he will only get better working with Martin Keown and Sol Campbell.\""]}, {"page": "List of Welling United F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Lee Clarke"]}]}}
