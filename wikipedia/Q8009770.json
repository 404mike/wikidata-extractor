He contested South Aberdeen in 1906, and the Elgin Burghs and Islington West in 1910 as a Liberal Unionist. He was formerly a member of the Committee of Management of the Philip Stott College (Unionist Association), and was chairman of the Glasgow Good Government League. He travelled widely in India and the Far East. He was a trustee and a member of the executive of the Navy League and chairman of the Glasgow and West of Scotland branch. His First World War work, for which he was made CBE, was especially concerned with V.A.D. committees, disabled officers, and the post-War training of officers.\nMr. Black presented to the city of Glasgow in 1930 the re-erected Mercat Cross; he had written works on Scottish mercat crosses. He wrote other works on folk-medicine, Glasgow archaeology, and a description of Heligoland and the islands of the North Sea. His law books included works on Lands Agents Act, local government in Scotland, the parochial ecclesiastical law of Scotland, a digest of decisions in Scottish shipping cases, and the history of teinds. He was F.S.A. (London and Scotland), a former president of the Glasgow Archaeological Society. In Glasgow he was vice-chairman of St Mungo's College and chairman of the Ophthalmic Institution, and was active in other educational and charitable institutions. His wife, who was a daughter of Robert Blackie, the publisher, died in 1920. His wife's young nephews and nieces found him a tedious adult visitor to their home and they invented this irreverent ditty which could be sung to the tune of \"The Ash Grove\". \n\"Rejected by Heaven,  From Hell given the sack,  He came  back to Earth,  As William George Black\" \n\nAttributionObituary.

The two were commissioned by William George Black who was a lawyer and writer based in Glasgow. Black was a well-established within the Glasgow Art Club, which included some well-known artists such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler.Cusack, Patricia. \"Lion Chambers: A Glasgow Experiment.\u201d Architectural History, vol. 28, 1985, pp. 198\u2013211. www.jstor.org/stable/1568532. Because of this he integrated into has plans artist's studios that would be located in the top floors of the building. The Glasgow City Council was known to have somewhat of a soft spot for the innovative club in which Black was part of, so it is thought that this may have been of some help in getting the building approved for construction. The building was home to many lawyers and artists for most of the 20th century, until the main bulk of the building had to be evacuated in 1995 due to the decision that it was too dangerous to regularly use. The ground floor and basement were still used up until 2009 when it was decided that they too should be evacuated. The building remains there to this day with no clear indication of its future \u2013 The sum needed to repair the building back to safe conditions is far too great for the multiple co-owners to afford, and no one else has showed enough interest to invest in it.Brebbia, C.A. & Hernandez, S. (2015). Structural Studies, Repairs and Maintenance of HERITAGE ARCHITECTURE XIV, p. 559. Lightening Source, UK.  The building has been threatened for demolition since 1991 when the co-owners were served with a \"Dangerous Building Notice\",Derelict Glasgow. http://www.derelictglasgow.co.uk/derelict.lionchambers.html .

Retrieved 8 November 2016 In April 1991, water-pooling, cracking and spalling affect the building due to its structural decay. The co-owners decide to pursue demolition, since the repairs are estimated at \u00a31\u20131.5 million. Four years later, The Scotsman reports that due to the danger of collapsing, all the occupants have been evacuated. Building Control has been assessed to the building. On 12 April 1995, The Independent reports that the owners of Lion Chambers have been served with a Dangerous Building Notice, after which they submit a demolition application. A month later, The Herald reports that for only 20 more years life of the building, the repairs cost at around \u00a31.5 million. A report by Glasgow Building Preservation Trust has been submitted to Glasgow City Council, proposing a longer term but expensive approach to repairs. On 29 August 1995 the permission to demolish has been refused, giving the owners 6 more months to deal with the Dangerous Building Notice, the press reports. They discuss with the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust about undertaking repairs, and also want to hear of other parties wishing to take on the building. In October 1997, Glasgow Building Preservation Trust reports that they want to develop a centre for young designers, including workshop and training spaces, called Centre for Product Resource Innovation and Design Enterprise (PRIDE). In 1999, \u00a35,000 has been granted for a feasibility study, as reported by The Annual Report of the Architectural Heritage Fund. The study says that re-using as dwellings and workshop space is viable. Historic Scotland and Glasgow City Council have agreed that more research is required into the building's mode of construction.", "Original design presented to the William George Black showed many weak points, including the lack of Thermal Insulation of the external walls and roof surfaces, causing condensation on the internal surfaces. Additionally, there was no external insulation against water penetration on the basement walls. This caused water to be able to penetrate the basement walls, which eventually led to the evacuation of the basement in 2009. In 2009, a feasibility study for the reparation of the Lion Chambers was instructed by Historic Scotland. The study advised there to be additional reparations to the building as further corrosion occurred due to the lack of activity in the building and the Glasgow City Council provided \u00a3156,000 to replace materials used in the building with wire mesh due to concerns over debris falling from the building. Furthermore, around 25% of the windows have been boarded over due to safety reasons and the northern and eastern walls have been vandalised at ground levelSimpson, Shona http://www.buildingsatrisk.org.uk/details/897874.
