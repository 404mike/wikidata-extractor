His clinical epidemiology research unit is one of the first to use big data in healthcare and medical research. His work has shown for the first time a link between high cholesterol and breast cancer. Further research has suggested the role of cholesterol and possibly statins improving the mortality in patients suffering from breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer and bowel cancer. Other prominent studies include health services research evaluating differences in death rates from weekend admission and discharge from UK hospitals, ethnic variations and the interplay between cardiovascular disease and mental health.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aston University", "response": ["*Rahul Potluri, Founder of ACALM, Doctor, Researcher, Scientist"]}, {"page": "King Edward VI Five Ways School", "response": ["* Rahul Potluri - doctor, researcher, scientist and Founder of ACALM"]}, {"page": "Rahul", "response": ["* Rahul Potluri (born 1983), Indian-British physician and researcher"]}, {"page": "List of British Indians", "response": ["* Rahul Potluri, medical doctor and epidemiologist"]}, {"page": "Aston Medical School", "response": ["Aston Medical Research Institute (AMRI) is the Translational Medicine arm of Aston University and brings together all five schools with a distinct focus: to rapidly develop new and affordable medical therapies and diagnostics for global use with relative ease.
