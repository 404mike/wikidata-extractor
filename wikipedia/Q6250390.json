Ordained the following year, he spent many years traveling New England, serving as minister in Buffalo, New York, Malden, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire as well as a teaching position at the Academical and Theological Institution of New Hampton, New Hampshire, before ill health forced him to travel south where he took up a ministry in Lexington, Virginia in 1845.\nIn 1848 he became editorial secretary of the American Baptist Publication Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was editor of its publications the Christian Chronicle and National Baptist.  It was under his tenure that a number of influential works of the day were published under his direction.\nBrown was one of the authors of the New Hampshire Confession of Faith in 1833, which was a more moderate expression of the more Calvinistic Baptist beliefs that existed at the time, and was widely accepted in the northern United States.  His name has become the one most associated with this work.\nBrown also authored a book of poetry, \"Emily and Other Poems,\" (1840) which was dedicated to a sister who had died young.\nBrown died on May 14, 1868 in the Philadelphia neighborhood of Germantown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 29", "response": ["*1803 \u2013 John Newton Brown, American minister and author (d. 1868)"]}, {"page": "John Brown", "response": ["*John Newton Brown (1803\u20131868), Baptist teacher, minister and publisher"]}, {"page": "New Hampshire Confession of Faith", "response": ["In 1833, Baptists in the United States agreed upon a confession of faith around which they could organize a missionary society under the Triennial Convention.

Retrieved June 22, 2013. The Confession was traditional. The controversy of the day was free will versus predestination. While the New Hampshire Confession is shorter than the 1742 Philadelphia Confession, it affirms the Philadelphia Confession. The New Hampshire Confession states that \"[Humans] by voluntary [free will] transgression fell from the holy and happy state [they were created]\" and that \"We believe that Election [predestination] is the eternal purpose of God, according to which he graciously regenerates, sanctifies, and saves sinners\". However, many saw the New Hampshire Confession as accepting free will. The free-will Baptists in the Northeast and West accepted the Confession, while the Calvinist (predestination) Baptists in the Southeast rejected the Confession but remained in the Triennial Convention.", "* John Newton Brown, early 19th century church reformer"]}]}}
