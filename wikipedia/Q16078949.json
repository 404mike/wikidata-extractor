He was also on the books of Sheffield Wednesday, but without representing that club in league competition, and played non-league football for Shotton, Seaham Harbour, Horden Colliery Welfare and South Shields.In 1933, Hopkinson and Darlington teammates Harry Brown, Billy Eden and Tom Halliday were members of the Rest of Durham XI that faced First Division club Sunderland in a match to celebrate the silver jubilee of the Durham County Football Association.Hopkinson was born in Royton, Lancashire, the son of Samuel Hopkinson, a piecer, and his wife Martha.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hopkinson", "response": ["* Fred Hopkinson (1908after 1935), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Tom Halliday", "response": ["He established himself in the starting eleven, and despite his youth, captained the team for three years. In the 1932\u201333 season, Halliday made 41 out of a possible 42 appearances in the league, taking his total to 127 in senior competition. In May 1933, he and Darlington teammates Harry Brown, Billy Eden and Fred Hopkinson were members of the Rest of Durham XI that faced Sunderland in a match to celebrate the silver jubilee of the Durham County Football Association. Darlington had finished bottom of the Northern Section, so had to apply for re-election. Although their application was successful, Halliday left the club."]}, {"page": "John Daglish", "response": ["Daglish made his debut at right half in the opening fixture of the season, on 30 August 1930 at home to Wigan Borough, a 3\u20132 defeat after which he lost his place to Fred Hopkinson and was restricted to reserve-team football in the North-Eastern League for a couple of months. In October, he was selected for the Rest of the North-Eastern League in the annual fixture against the reigning champions, who this year were Middlesbrough's reserves. Dalglish returned to Darlington's first team in November for a run of seven matches playing at centre half. He scored his first Football League goal in the last of the seven, at home to Stockport County: he passed to Maurice Wellock who lost the ball, but Daglish recovered it to \"easily beat\" Stockport's goalkeeper. However, a missed penalty by Dickson and what the Athletic News reported as \"serious defensive lapses\" contributed to a 3\u20132 defeat. Daglish made no more first-team appearances during 1930\u201331, and although he remained on their books for a further two seasons, played only rarely as cover, twice in 1931\u201332 and seven times in 1932\u201333, when he was sometimes used at full back."]}]}}
