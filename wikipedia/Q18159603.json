He was in 1892\u20131893 an artist on Sir Martin Conway's expedition to the Karakoram subrange of the Himalayas and in 1895 an artist on Clinton T. Dent's expedition to the Caucasus Mountains. His first exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art was in 1889, and through the end of 1904 he exhibited there eleven paintings, including Sakar, India: moonlight (1895) and A Hunter's Shrine, Central Caucasus (1901). In 1927 he painted Head of a Sailor for John Player & Sons for the promotion of Player's Navy Cut cigarettes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nuristanis", "response": ["Prior to 1895, the Kafirs of Hindukush were classified into two groups\u2015 the Siah-posh (black clad) and the Safed-posh (white clad) Kafirs, also known as the Lal-posh (red-clad), so-called because of the colour of the robes they wore. But the British investigator George Scott Robertson who visited Kafiristan and studied the Kafirs for about two years (1889\u20131891) improved upon the old classification by recognising that the Safed-posh Kafirs were actually members of several separate clans, viz, the Waigulis, Presungulis or Viron, and the Ashkuns.

The Siah-posh Katirs were further divided into the Katirs, who occupied twelve villages of the lower Bashgul (Kam) country, the Kti or Katawar, who lived in two villages in the Kti Valley, the Kulam, and the Ramguli, the most numerous group, living in twenty four villages in the Ramgul Valley, in the westernmost part of Kafiristan on the Afghan frontier.Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh, 1977 edition, p 127, John Biddulph; An Inquiry Into the Ethnography of Afghanistan, 1891, p 146, Henry Walter Bellew; The K\u00e1firs of the Hindu-Kush, 1896, pp 71, 74 sqq., George Scott Robertson, Arthur David McCormick.", "All Siah-posh groups of Kafirs were regarded as of common origin.

According to him, the present dominant clans of Kafirstan viz. the Katirs (Kamtoz), the Kams (Kamoz) and the Wais are mainly descended from the ancient Indian population of eastern Afghanistan who refused to embrace Islam in tenth century, and fled for refuge from victorious Moslems to the hilly fastnesses of Kafirstan.
