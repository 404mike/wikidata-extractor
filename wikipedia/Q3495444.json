However, the visiting side's makeshift front row did not lose one strike against the head and England gradually took control of the game when Stevens returned. With the forwards keeping the Springboks at bay, Doble scored four penalties and converted Alan Morley's second half try from the touchline to help England to a most unlikely victory."]}, {"page": "Sport in Cornwall", "response": ["Cornish rugby has produced many fine rugby players who have played at international level.
