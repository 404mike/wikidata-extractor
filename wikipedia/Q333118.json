He has written over 20 books, self-published since the mid-1990s, and spoken in more than 25 countries.In 1990, he visited a psychic who told him he was on Earth for a purpose and would receive messages from the spirit world. This led him to state in 1991 he was a \"Son of the Godhead\" and that the world would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes, predictions he repeated on the BBC show Wogan. His appearance led to public ridicule. Books Icke wrote over the next 11 years developed his world view of New Age conspiracism. His endorsement of an antisemitic forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, in The Robots' Rebellion (1994) and And the Truth Shall Set You Free (1995) led his publisher to stop handling his books, which have been self-published since then.Icke believes the universe to consist of \"vibrational\" energy and infinite dimensions sharing the same space. He claims an inter-dimensional race of reptilian beings, the Archons or Anunnaki, have hijacked the Earth and a genetically modified human\u2013Archon hybrid race of shape-shifting reptilians \u2013 the Babylonian Brotherhood, Illuminati or \"elite\" \u2013 manipulate events to keep humans in fear, so that the Archons can feed off the resulting \"negative energy\". He claims many public figures belong to the Babylonian Brotherhood and propel humanity towards a global fascist state or New World Order, a post-truth era ending freedom of speech. He sees the only way to defeat such \"Archontic\" influence is for people to wake up to the truth and fill their hearts with love. Critics have accused Icke of being antisemitic and a Holocaust denier with his theories of reptilians serving as a deliberate \"code\". Icke denies these claims.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 29", "response": ["*  1952   \u2013 David Icke, English footballer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Ann Widdecombe", "response": ["Widdecombe and two other Brexit Party figures were criticised for previous appearances on the David Icke-affiliated Richie Allen Show, which has been accused of promoting Holocaust denial and antisemitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family and Zionism.

Bernard Lewis, noting in 1987 that Arab scholars had dropped it, remarked that it only occasionally emerged in Arab political discourse. It has also played some role in Soviet antisemitic chauvinism and Slavic Eurasian historiography; particularly, in the works of scholars like Lev Gumilev, it came to be exploited by the white supremacist Christian Identity movement and even by terrorist esoteric cults like Aum Shinriky\u014d. The Kazar hypothesis was further exploited by esoteric fascists such as Miguel Serrano, referring to a lost Palestinabuch by the German Nazi-scholar Herman Wirth, who is said to have proven that the Jews descended from a prehistoric migrant group parasiting on the Great Civilizations.Miguel Serrano, Adolf Hitler, the Ultimate Avatar (1984), 2011, p. 79, 295.
