Holden & Co., a saddlery business in Adelaide.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 16. In 1879 J A Holden's eldest son Henry James (HJ) Holden, became a partner and effectively managed the company. In 1885, German-born H. A. Frost joined the business as a junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (1998): p. 7. Edward Holden, James' grandson, joined the firm in 1905 with an interest in automobiles. From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships, and in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery. The company began to re-body older chassis using motor bodies produced by F T Hack and Co from 1914. Holden & Frost mounted the body, and painted and trimmed it. The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies after 1913. After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. H.J. Holden founded a new company in late 1917, and registered Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd (HMBB) on 25 February 1919, specialising in car bodies and using the former F T Hack & Co facility at 400 King William Street in Adelaide before erecting a large four-story factory on the site.Darwin (2002), p. 3.", "From here, Holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an Australian car. This involved compromise with GM, as Holden's managing director, Laurence Hartnett, favoured development of a local design, while GM preferred to see an American design as the basis for \"Australia's Own Car\".Loffler (2006), p. 5\u20137. In the end, the design was based on a previously rejected postwar Chevrolet proposal.Loffler (2000), p. 5. The Holden was launched in 1948, creating long waiting lists extending through 1949 and beyond.Balderstone, Bowan, Lewis (2006), p. 184\u2013188. The name \"Holden\" was chosen in honour of Sir Edward Holden, the company's first chairman and grandson of J.A. Holden. Other names considered were \"GeM\", \"Austral\", \"Melba\", \"Woomerah\", \"Boomerang\", \"Emu\", and \"Canbra\", a phonetic spelling of Canberra. Although officially designated \"48\u2013215\", the car was marketed simply as the \"Holden\". The unofficial usage of the name \"FX\" originated within Holden, referring to the updated suspension on the 48\u2013215 of 1953.Loffler (2002), p. 4.", "*Edward Holden (1917\u20131934)"]}, {"page": "Laurence Hartnett", "response": ["Arriving in March 1934, to take over his new role at GMH\u2019s head office in Melbourne,Joe Rich Hartnett: Portrait of a Technocratic Brigand p.69 he found himself almost immediately embroiled in a struggle for control of the Australian operation with the chairman of the board of directors, (Sir) Edward Holden, whose family had founded the Adelaide motor body building part of the business.N.
