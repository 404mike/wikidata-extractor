When Chelsea signed winger Mickey Thomas in January 1984, Rhoades-Brown was sold to Oxford United for \u00a385,000.\nHe immediately gained a regular place with Oxford, but the problem of accommodating Kevin Brock saw Rhoades-Brown become less of a permanent feature in the Second Division Championship side. An untimely injury, coincidentally against Queen's Park Rangers (Oxford's Wembley opponents), prevented him from playing in the 1986 League Cup Final. He stayed with Oxford until 1989 when injury forced his retirement, his last game being at Bristol City on 11 October 1989. In total he played 87 League matches for Oxford (plus 25 substitute appearances), scoring 13 goals. In competitive games, he played 113 times (plus 29 as a substitute), scoring 16 goals. He remains at Oxford United where he works as Business Development Manager for the club.\nA testimonial match between an Oxford United XI and a Chelsea XI was held for him at the Kassam Stadium on 30 April 2007 in front of a crowd of 5,130. Among the players who appeared in the match were Rhoades-Brown's former Oxford teammates Ray Houghton, Joey Beauchamp and ex-England manager Steve McClaren.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Canoville", "response": ["He ended the 1981\u201382 season with two late substitute appearances, replacing Peter Rhoades-Brown on the right-wing on both occasions. He enjoyed a run of six games at the start of the 1982\u201383 season before he was sidelined with a thigh injury. He scored his first goal for the club with a volley in a 1\u20131 draw with Fulham. With Chelsea facing relegation into the Third Division, Canoville was returned to the first team towards the end of the campaign and helped the club to secure enough points to avoid relegation. He gradually won over the majority of supporters to the point that his name was sung by Chelsea fans, though the racist abuse continued for years."]}, {"page": "List of Oxford United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|January 1984||Peter Rhoades-Brown||Chelsea||align=right|\u00a385,000"]}, {"page": "Alex Fisher", "response": ["Born in London and educated at Abingdon School, Fisher joined Oxford United whilst playing for St. Edmunds at the age of seven under Peter Rhoades-Brown where he went all the way through the Centre of Excellence helping win the Under-18s Youth Team Championship in the 2006\u201307 season.
