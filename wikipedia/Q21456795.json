The different materials used in the exterior are artistically and quietly disposed, and the details are bold and good, and sufficiently uncommon to deserve more than ordinary notice, in asmuch as they are a step towards what we yet hope to see universal in practice. The vigour and beauty of Gothic detail applied to buildings which, save for these, would present the familiar appearance in general disposition of their parts, of what some people call the \u201d common sense \u201d school. The public, right or wrong, will have buildings of this type, and are so wedded to it that we are never likely to see a revival of the picturesque type of Gothic to any extent : and it appears far from impossible to engraft on this accepted style some of the boldness of Gothic treatment, without either bad taste or incongruity.\u201d "]}, {"page": "Frederick James Quick", "response": ["Quick was a friend of the artist and architect James Edward Rogers and in 1896 acted as an executor of his friend's will.\u201cROGERS James Edward of 35 Fitzroy-road Middlesex\u201d in Wills and Administrations, England and Wales (1896), p. 299"]}, {"page": "J.
