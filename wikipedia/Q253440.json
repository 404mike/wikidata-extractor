After the death of Lena's mother, Lionel takes in his illegitimate daughter but lies to her and the public that his second child is adopted.

She debuts in the season two premiere episode titled \"The Adventures of Supergirl\" and was promoted to a series regular for the third season. This version is initially depicted as the adoptive sister of Lex Luthor, but is later revealed to be his paternal half-sister through an affair that Lionel Luthor had. As the new CEO of Luthor Corp following her brother's incarceration, Lena moves to National City and rebrands the company as \"L-Corp\" to distance it and herself from Lex's reputation. Lex hires the assassin John Corben to kill her in retaliation, but Lena shoots him to save Alex Danvers. She later helps Kara Danvers find Veronica Sinclair, and in turn, Kara goes to a gala being held at L-Corp (as herself and Supergirl), later discovered to be a trap to robbers involved in a crime wave involving alien guns. Soon after, it is discovered that her mother was none other than the director of Project Cadmus, who plans to wipe out earth's entire alien population with an airborne substance. Lena turns on Lillian right before they are about to go through with the plan before revealing she switched out the substance and called the police. In the episode \"Luthors\", Lena discovers she is the product of an affair Lionel had with his mistress, before being framed by her mother for stealing kryptonite. She was then kidnapped by Lillian, ensuring the latter's escape alongside that of Metallo so she can use her to access one of Lex Luthor's storage areas before being rescued by Supergirl. In the episode \"Ace Reporter\", Lena reunites with her ex-boyfriend Jack Spheer, who is the CEO of Spheerical Industries and has invented a new nanobot technology called Biomax. When Kara discovers that Jack had been faking the human trials and injected himself with Biomax, Lena confronts him, only to find out he is being controlled by his CFO, Beth Breen. While Supergirl fights Jack, Lena fights Breen and destroys the control device and overloads the mainframe to save Supergirl, causing Jack to die, leaving Lena devastated. Later, Lena agrees to work with Rhea, unaware of her alien heritage, on a business project, a transmitter portal. Lena ends up forming a motherly bond with Rhea, who encourages her to be different than her family. Lena then finds out Rhea is an alien after she uses an alien element to finish the portal, but Rhea manages to convince her to continue working with her. Rhea then betrays Lena and uses the portal to bring her Daxamite fleet to Earth, then transports Lena and Mon-El to her ship. In the episode \"Resist\", Rhea forces Lena and Mon-El to get married, but they are saved by Supergirl, Lillian, and Cyborg Superman. In \"Nevertheless, She Persisted\", Lillian then reveals a device that Lex created to kill Kryptonians, but Lena and Winn modify it to kill Daxamites, killing Rhea and causing the fleet to retreat, saving the Earth. During Season Three, Lena Luthor develops a rivalry with Morgan Edge. When Morgan Edge poisoned Lena in the episode \"For Good\", Lilian Luthor plans revenge by targeting Morgan Edge. After Lena is cured of the poison, she has a moment with her mother as Lilian and Morgan are arrested by the authorities upon their respective defeats at the hands of Supergirl. Kara and Lena maintain a good friendship for most of the series until Lex Luthor reveals Supergirl's true identity to Lena, causing Lena to become bitter at this apparent 'evidence' that her friend didn't truly trust her. Lena initially attempted to use alien technology to basically brainwash most of humanity to remove their darker impulses, even spending the first half of the season pretending to have forgiven Kara's lie so that she could access the Fortress of Solitude,  but when she is forced to accept that the kind of mind-manipulation she is attempting is impossible, she rejects Lex's offer to join her in conquering the world and returns to help Supergirl instead. After Lex has been drained of his stolen powers, Lena uses Myriad to erase his knowledge of Kara's secret identity.
