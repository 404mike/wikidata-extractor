Marjorie Baumgarten, reviewing for the Austin Chronicle said: \"Few filmmakers would be able to mount a discourse on the 20th century's art and thought process as broad and extensive as this\".  Australian film critic Adrian Martin, in a four-star review, commented: \"It is the form of this remembered, necessarily scrappy, haunted, sad history which Godard evokes in all the prodigious techniques of his Histoire(s) du cin\u00e9ma.\" Calling it an \"intellectual striptease\", New York Times film critic Dave Kehr wrote: \"Perhaps, like Joyce\u2019s Finnegans Wake, this is not a work to be read but a work to be read in: to be picked up and put down, sampled and considered, over a period of time. Jean-Luc Godard took 30 years to compose his Histoire(s). It might take just as long to absorb it.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum in the Chicago Reader agreed, stating: \"For better and for worse, it's comparable to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake in both its difficulty and its playfulness\". In the academic journal Film Quarterly, James S. Williams described the project as \"Godard\u2019s gift to us: a threnody of love\" and as offering \"irrefutable proof\" that \"the forms of art\u2014the forms that think\u2014can help lay the basis for new forms of being\". Alifeleti Brown, writing for Senses of Cinema, praised the series as being \"Godard\u2019s most devastating accomplishment as filmmaker/critic/artist/poet/historian\". Michael Wood compared the series to an \"archaeology of mind, the apparently disordered rescue of a lifetime\u2019s memory of film\" in a piece for the London Review of Books"]}, {"page": "Michael wood (academic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Wood (literary scholar) "]}, {"page": "List of corresponding fellows of the British Academy", "response": ["|Professor Michael Wood"]}, {"page": "Michael Wood (academic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Wood (literary scholar)"]}, {"page": "List of American Academy of Arts and Sciences members (1994\u20132005)", "response": ["* Michael Wood", "* Michael Woodford"]}, {"page": "Emily Apter", "response": ["* (2015) Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon (Co-edited with Jacques Lezra and Michael Wood of the English edition of the Vocabulaire europ\u00e9en des philosophies: Dictionnaire des intraduisibles ed.
