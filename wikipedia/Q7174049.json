Ney", "response": ["During the balloon project, Ney's research on cosmic-rays became less intense, but he continued to work with Freier and guided student work in the field.  He became more active, in anticipation of IGY, when Peter Fowler came to Minnesota in 1956/57.  Fowler, Freier and Ney measured the intensity of Helium nuclei as a function of energy.  They found that, at high energies, the intensity exhibited a steep decrease with increasing energy, but at lower energies, it peaked and then decreased at even lower energies.  Because the peak intensity varied within the solar cycle, these measurements were an early observation of the solar modulation of low-energy galactic cosmic rays."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (P)", "response": ["*Peter Fowler (physicist)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1964", "response": ["#Peter Fowler"]}, {"page": "Mary Fowler (geologist)", "response": ["Fowler was born in 1950 to Rosemary and Peter Fowler.
