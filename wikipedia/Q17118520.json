Cordiner recounts the discovery of the ancient stone image of Ganesh worshipped in a mud hut at the site. The shrine's well had been covered by a stone slab. Another shrine dedicated to Murugan of Kathirkamam was also present and revered during his visit.

He named this new species Scomber heberi, placing it in the mackerel genus which at that time was a common genus for placing carangid fishes. The origin of the specific epithet is unclear, with it possibly named after someone or relate to the German word Heber, meaning \"lob\". With the creation of the genus Caranx, the species was transferred there, where it has remained. There is some confusion over a species described by Peter Forssk\u00e5l in 1775 under the name Scomber sansun and later transferred to Caranx sansun. This species is still listed as valid by some authorities, although a 1968 review of the taxon by J.L.B. Smith failed to find the holotype and suggested a new name with holotype be introduced to replace it; Caranx williamsi. This name was sunk into C. heberi by William Smith-Vaniz in a major review, indicating C. sansun also should be sunk. Despite this, the name remains valid amongst some authorities. A second, later independent description of the fish by Georges Cuvier produced the name Caranx sem, which became common throughout the literature. Probable synonymy with C. heberi was recognized by Henry Fowler in 1905"]}, {"page": "Sixbar wrasse", "response": ["Thalassoma hardwicke was originally formally described as Sparus hardwicke in 1830 by the English John Whitchurch Bennett (1790-1853) with the type locality given as the south coast of Ceylon.
