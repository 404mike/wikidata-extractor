A renowned teacher, his works were much collected and frequently republished across Europe. His \"sane conservatism\" and his sceptical, logical approach to the study of texts such as Aristotle or the Bible were less prized in the subsequent age of humanism where a more committed and linguistic/literary, approach prevailed. His influence in logic (especially the analysis of terms), science (impetus and infinitesimals), politics (placing the people over kings), Church (councils over Popes), and international law (establishing the human rights of \"savages\" conquered by the Spanish) can be traced across the centuries and appear decidedly modern, and it is only in the modern age that he is not routinely dismissed as a scholastic. His Latin style did not help \u2013 he thought that \"it is of more moment to understand aright, and clearly to lay down the truth of any matter than to use eloquent language\". Nevertheless, it is to his writings, including their dedications, that we owe much of our knowledge of the everyday facts of Major's life \u2013 for example his \"shortness of stature\". He was an extremely curious and very observant man, and used his experiences \u2013 of earthquakes in Paisley, thunder in Glasgow, storms at sea, eating oatcakes in northern England \u2013 to illustrate the more abstract parts of his logical writings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Bosworth Field", "response": ["Henry's initial force consisted of the English and Welsh exiles who had gathered around Henry, combined with a contingent of mercenaries put at his disposal by Charles VIII of France. The history of Scottish author John Major (published in 1521) claims that Charles had granted Henry 5,000 men, of whom 1,000 were Scots, headed by Sir Alexander Bruce. No mention of Scottish soldiers was made by subsequent English historians."]}, {"page": "Robin Hood", "response": ["Fixing the Robin Hood story to the 1190s had been first proposed by John Major in his Historia Majoris Britanni\u00e6 (1521), (and he also may have been influenced in so doing by the story of Warin); this was the period in which King Richard was absent from the country, fighting in the Third Crusade.Holt, p. 170.", "Following this, John Major mentions Robin Hood within his Historia Majoris Britanni\u00e6 (1521), casting him in a positive light by mentioning his and his followers' aversion to bloodshed and ethos of only robbing the wealthy; Major also fixed his floruit not to the mid-13th century but the reigns of Richard I of England and his brother, King John. Richard Grafton, in his Chronicle at Large (1569) went further when discussing Major's description of \"Robert Hood\", identifying him for the first time as a member of the gentry, albeit possibly \"being of a base stock and linaege, was for his manhood and chivalry advanced to the noble dignity of an Earl\" and not the yeomanry, foreshadowing Anthony Munday's casting of him as the dispossed Earl of Huntingdon. The name nevertheless still had a reputation of sedition and treachery in 1605, when Guy Fawkes and his associates were branded \"Robin Hoods\" by Robert Cecil. In 1644, jurist Edward Coke described Robin Hood as a historical figure who had operated in the reign of King Richard I around Yorkshire; he interpreted the contemporary term \"roberdsmen\" (outlaws) as meaning followers of Robin Hood."]}, {"page": "John Knox", "response": ["Knox was probably educated at the grammar school in Haddington. At this time, the priesthood was the only path for those whose inclinations were academic rather than mercantile or agricultural. He proceeded to further studies at the University of St Andrews or possibly at the University of Glasgow. He studied under John Major, one of the greatest scholars of the time.. According to MacGregor, there is a \"John Knox\" recorded to have enrolled at the University of Glasgow in 1522. However, the name John Knox was quite common, and the identification of the Glasgow student as the future reformer cannot be made with certainty. John Major was known to have taught at the University of Glasgow and later at the University of St Andrews. Given the birth date calculated by Hay Fleming, he would have been too young to have attended Glasgow at the time when Major was teaching there. The time when Major was teaching at St Andrews is consistent both with Knox being of university age and with a statement made by Theodore Beza that Knox was taught by Major at St Andrews. Knox was ordained a Catholic priest in Edinburgh on Easter Eve of 1536 by William Chisholm, Bishop of Dunblane.", "Knox's powers as a preacher came to the attention of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish church on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead.; "]}, {"page": "Blind Harry", "response": ["He is mentioned by William Dunbar on line 69 of his Lament for the Makeris early in the 16th century. Historian John Major also wrote about Harry in 1518.

Following Hall and Holinshed, Shakespeare attributes these arguments to Chichele. at a time when Chichele was not yet formally Archbishop, although he had been appointed by the King immediately following the death of Archbishop Arundel on 14 February 1414. Moreover, it is said that the Parliamentary rolls do not record Chichele's presence, and according to Tait the question of war with France was not discussed. In addition, Westmorland's speech urging the advantages of war against Scotland rather than France is said to be adapted from a work by the Scottish historian, John Major, who was not born until half a century after the 1414 Parliament."]}, {"page": "Gavin Douglas", "response": ["Before the crisis of 1513, Douglas was a friend and correspondent of many of the internationally renowned men of his age, including Polydore Vergil, John Major, Cardinal Wolsey and Henry, 3rd Lord Sinclair. Because of his powerful family connections and role in high public life, he is the best-documented of the early Scottish makars. Indeed, of poets in the British Isles before him, only the biography of Chaucer is as well documented or understood. All his literary work was composed before his 40th year while he was Provost of St Giles in Edinburgh. Douglas's literary work was composed in a highly polished Middle Scots, often aureate in style. After the Eneados he is not known to have produced any further poetry, despite being at the height of his artistic powers when it was completed in 1513, six weeks before the Battle of Flodden. No more than four of works by him are known to exist; The Palice of Honour, Conscience, his major translation the Eneados, and possibly King Hart."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* John Major (philosopher)", "* John Major"]}, {"page": "Battle of Harlaw", "response": ["*  \u2013 available online as the at Google Books (2007 Echo Library reprint and others), a Gutenberg e-book at Scribd and a poorly OCR'd text file at archive.org.
