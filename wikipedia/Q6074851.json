He also appeared for Griqualand West  (1904/05), Transvaal (1906/07) and The Players (1902). He also played for the Yorkshire Second XI (1899\u20131901) and Yorkshire Colts (1902).\nBorn in Wombwell, Yorkshire, Washington was a left-handed batsman, who scored 1,384 runs at 21.96, in his 48 first-class games, with a best of 100 not out against Surrey, his only century. He held eighteen catches in the field. His nephew, Roy Kilner, played Test cricket for England, whilst another nephew, Norman Kilner, played over 400 first-class matches for Yorkshire and Warwickshire.\nArguably Washington's most famous innings was one of nine not out against the Australians in 1902, as this enabled Yorkshire to reach 50 for 5 wickets in their second innings, and thereby achieve a five-wicket victory.Washington died in October 1927, in Wombwell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "C.I.D. Investigators", "response": ["While the protagonist Yossarian is in the hospital during the opening of the novel, he is forced to censor letters written by enlisted men in the same hospital.  This soon becomes monotonous and he begins censoring at random.  To these documents that he has ravaged, he signs Washington Irving or, alternatively, Irving Washington.  A C.I.D. man, the military's version of a CIA or FBI agent, disguises himself as a patient and goes undercover in Yossarian's hospital, in order to determine the culprit for the over-zealous censorship. ", "Later, Major Major begins signing documents as Washington Irving, having heard about the C.I.D. man trying to catch the man censoring documents and signing them Washington Irving in the hospital.  When Washington Irving grows monotonous, Major Major switches to Irving Washington; later on, he adds his own twist to the device, signing John Milton and Milton John (observing as he does the comparative brevity of 'John Milton' will increase his signing turnover) before eventually returning to Washington Irving.  Eventually, a second C.I.D. man is dispatched, and very soon begin confiding their secret identities to every individual on the base on the condition that they (the individuals) tell no one else. As a result, the situation soon arrives that everyone on the base knows of the presence of two C.I.D. men, with the exception of the C.I.D. men themselves."]}, {"page": "Time travel in fiction", "response": ["A time slip is a plot device in fantasy and science fiction in which a person, or group of people, seem to travel through time by unknown means.

His brother Norman also played cricket, representing Yorkshire and Warwickshire. The Kilners attended Wombwell Parish Church and the boys were members of the Church Lads' Brigade.Pope, p. 4. His father and his uncle, Irving Washington, the former Yorkshire player, encouraged him to play cricket from an early age. He showed enough ability to join the local colliery team, Mitchell Main.", "The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to play and coach in India in the winter of 1927\u201328. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very reluctant to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting.Pope, p. 50. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire teammates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed.Pope, pp. 51\u201352 He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in the first few days of April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.Pope, p. 52."]}, {"page": "Norman Kilner", "response": ["His brother, Roy Kilner played Test cricket for England whilst his nephew, Irving Washington, also played for Yorkshire as a left-handed bat.
