Prior to this cattlemen had run cattle and built stockman's huts on the land west of Westbury. From the 1820s onwards land grants began being issued as the land was gradually surveyed.Evans & Terry, p.9  A systemic exploration of Mole Creek and the area west was conducted in 1826 by Edward Curr, Joseph Fossey and Henry Hellyer.Evans & Terry, p.20 Mole Creek was originally a mixture of tall forest, plains and boggy marsh. Settlers in the early 19th century cleared the land largely using fire and the ring barking of trees.Evans & Terry, p.33 The land was first held in large leaseholds by the wealthiest in the colony of Tasmania. In the mid-19th century a number of waste lands acts were passed by the government allowing for smaller holdings, opening up the then densely forested land around the town of Mole Creek.Evans & Terry, p.26  Many of these first settlers were farm labourers or ex-convicts, who had worked as labourers or tenant farmers on the larger holdings."]}, {"page": "Tasmanian emu", "response": ["At a ceremony at Cape Grim on 14 April 1834, Aboriginal people danced and characterised emus by stretching out one arm to emulate the long neck of the bird. The Tasmanian emu was also symbolised in Indigenous art. The depiction of the emu in \u2018native drawings\u2019 is noted in the narrative of the overland journey of Sir John and Lady Franklin from Hobart to Macquarie Harbour in 1842. The area they were referring to was subsequently called Painters Plains.  The emu\u2019s representation in ceremonial activities and art suggests a great familiarity with the emu and may further support the notion of its abundance in Van Diemen\u2019s Land. The proliferation of places in Van Diemen\u2019s Land named after the emu also indicates the plentiful existence of the species. Henry Hellyer, the surveyor for the Van Diemen\u2019s Land Company, came across a river and seeing the footprints of the emu on some moist ground by the water called it Emu River. Emu Bay takes its name from that river. There are also Emu Bottom, Emu Valley, Emu Flat, Emu Hill, Emu Ground, Emu Heights, Emu Plains and Emu Point. There was an Emu Inn in Hobart as early as 1823, and later the Emu Tavern in Liverpool Street, Hobart."]}, {"page": "1832 in Australia", "response": ["* 1/2 September \u2013 Henry Hellyer, Van Diemen's Land explorer (b. 1790)"]}, {"page": "Hellyer Gorge", "response": ["The Hellyer Gorge is a gorge in Tasmania, through which flows the Hellyer River, named after Henry Hellyer.
