His research interests focus on the study of cognition, especially in the areas of cognitive architectures, perception, intuition, problem solving, learning and decision making. He has developed the CHREST cognitive architecture, an acronym for Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures, which is a complete architecture for the processes of learning and perception used by humans.\nHe is a chess International Master, and played numerous times for the Swiss national team. He was co-editor of the Swiss Chess Review from 1981 to 1989. His Elo rating is 2400.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of artificial intelligence projects", "response": ["* CHREST, developed under Fernand Gobet at Brunel University and Peter C.

Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of Adriaan de Groot, William Chase, Herbert A. Simon, and Fernand Gobet have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing."]}, {"page": "Chess", "response": ["More recent research has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much recent research. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess.Ericsson, K.A., Krampe, R. Th., & Tesch-R\u00f6mer, C. (1993). \u00a0 Psychological Review, 100, 363\u2013406. Retrieved 21 March 2017. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.Gobet, F. & Chassy, P.

Simon", "response": ["Simon was interested in how humans learn and, with Edward Feigenbaum, he developed the EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) theory, one of the first theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program. EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning. Later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise. With Fernand Gobet, he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model. The theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata, which are more complex structures. CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise."]}, {"page": "Boris Spassky", "response": ["Spassky did, however, score some notable triumphs in his later years. In his return to tournament play after the loss to Korchnoi, he tied for first at Bugojno 1978 on 10/15 with Karpov, with both players scoring +6-1=8 to finish a point ahead of Timman. He was clear first at Montilla\u2013Moriles 1978 with 6\u00bd/9.

Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree, knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games, such as chess. A study of the effects of age on Go-playing has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players. According to the review of Gobet and colleagues, the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as PET and fMRI does not show large differences between Go and chess. On the other hand, a study by Xiangchuan Chen et al. showed greater activation in the right hemisphere among Go players than among chess players. There is some evidence to suggest a correlation between playing board games and reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia."]}, {"page": "List of psychologists", "response": ["* Fernand Gobet, cognitive psychology"]}, {"page": "Adriaan de Groot", "response": ["* Perception and memory in chess: Heuristics of the professional eye  (1996; with Fernand Gobet and Riekent Jongman)."]}, {"page": "Cognitive architecture", "response": ["| CHREST || developed under Fernand Gobet at Brunel University and Peter C.

Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20, 280-285.D. Zachary Hambrick & Elizabeth Meinz (2011), Limits on the predictive power of domain-specific experience and knowledge in skilled performance. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20, 275-279. More recently, a meta-analysis found the correlation coefficient between deliberate practice and performance was 0.40, the size of which is large compared to other predictor variables (eg. obesity, excessive drinking, smoking, intelligence, adherence to effective medication). In addition, Malcolm Gladwell's point-of-view about deliberate practice is different from Ericsson's view.  Gladwell, staff writer at The New Yorker magazine and author of five books on The New York Times Best Seller list including Outliers: The Story of Success said in a May 2016 Freakonomics podcast interview that, \"He's [Ericsson] a hard practice guy, and I'm a soft practice guy.\" Gladwell claims that talent is important with an intentional dedication to practice and having a support system is vital to produce superior outcomes. It is not all about methodical effort as Ericsson claims. In Malcolm Gladwell's book, one chapter is called \"The Matthew Effect.\" This effect describes how different biases can affect an individual's performance. When someone is practicing a skill, especially with deliberate practice, coaches play an important role in how their practices go. If a coach sets high expectations and encourages their learners, the individual is more likely to take more from practice and perform better. The role of coaches is important during deliberate practice. Coaches can strengthen desired behaviors through encouragement, positive reinforcement, and technical instruction. Fostering a positive learning environment through deliberate practice is key for all individuals involved. It is also important for coaches to lay out their practices with specific skill training, variable practice, and training open and closed skills. These factors lead to an intentional deliberate practice which ultimately leads to better learning and performance."]}, {"page": "CHREST", "response": ["CHREST is developed by Fernand Gobet at Brunel University and Peter C.

In 2020, psychologist and neuroscientist Wei Ji Ma summarized the state of research on women in chess as \"there is currently zero evidence for biological differences in chess ability between the genders\" but added \"that does not mean that there are certainly no such differences.\""]}]}}
