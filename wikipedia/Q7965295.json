His images of postwar London went unrecognised until 2011 when knowledge of his work reached the British Library\u2019s curator of visual arts, John Falconer. Though Joseph had always been doubtful of his ability, his stepdaughter had been eager to bring his work into the public eye for some time, and through a friend Falconer found out that she was still in possession of a collection of Joseph's negatives. Of the eighty surviving images, thirty were displayed for the first time in an exhibition at London's British Library between July and September 2011 as part of the London Street Photography Festival.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mooragh Internment Camp", "response": ["*Walter Joseph (1922\u20132003), photographer"]}, {"page": "List of street photographers", "response": ["* Walter Joseph (1922\u20132003)\"Shooting the street \", Design Week, 8 June 2011. \"At first [Joseph] was interned on the Isle of Man, before later finding work in newspaper photographic laboratories and photographing street traders on the side.\" Accessed 21 February 2017."]}, {"page": "To Kill a Child (1953 film)", "response": ["*Nosegay av Walter Joseph, instrumental"]}]}}
