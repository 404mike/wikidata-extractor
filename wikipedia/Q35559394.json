Monk said later that Roberts had been unfortunate, but that the consistency of the Morrison\u2013Dean partnership meant they kept their places. With Dean suspended for two of the last three matches of the season, Roberts came into the side to face Sheffield United and scored a first-half equaliser in a win that made a major contribution to their avoiding relegation. Morrison and Dean remained the pairing of choice, but when Morrison injured a hamstring in December 2018, Roberts was unable to take his chance. Nine minutes into his first league start of the season, he suffered a calf injury that left him unfit for selection until after the March 2019 international break.
