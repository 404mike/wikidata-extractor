The Liberal Party was increasingly becoming divided between the Ginger Group (Queensland) which opposed the Government on a number of issues and wanted to be the senior coalition partner, and was typically composed of more moderate small l liberals, vs the typically older and more conservative members who were content with the status quo. Increasingly new Liberal Party members being elected were less conservative. On 9 October 1978, this (combined with a failure to win many seats in the last election) had resulted in Sir William Knox being deposed as leader and replaced by Edwards. This stoush, and the increasing number of three cornered contests in the 1977 election had attracted the ire of the National Party in the 1980 election, where they had engaged in three-cornered contests in three seats to defeat Bruce Bishop (Surfers Paradise), Peter White (Southport), and Tony Bourke (Lockyer). Bishop and White had been particularly open in their hostility to the National Party, and to alleged corruption by Russ Hinze on the Gold Coast. Three incidents in 1981 had further damaged relations between the Nationals and many Liberals, with the Liberal representation in Cabinet reduced from 8 to 7, the appointment of John\u2019s friend Ted Lyons to the CVhairmanship of the TAB board, and the appointment of the new Chief Justice.Lane, Don 1993, Trial and Error Boolarong Publications Pp97 "]}, {"page": "List of British featherweight boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Llew Edwards"]}, {"page": "Owen Moran", "response": ["|align=left| Llew Edwards", "|align=left| Llew Edwards"]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Boxing Council champions", "response": ["|align=left |  Llew Edwards"]}, {"page": "Bob Marriott", "response": ["Marriott was due to defend his British title against Llew Edwards in May 1920 but declined the fight and reportedly returned his Lonsdale Belt to the National Sporting Club."]}, {"page": "Charlie Hardcastle", "response": ["Hardcastle started 1917 with a points loss to former English champion Seaman Arthur Hayes in January.

Stone gained the advantage and was said to have his \"hands, feet, and shoulders all working, while the manner in which he bore into his opponent was both interesting and effective\".
