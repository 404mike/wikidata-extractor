The \"extensive\" park, contained ancient oak and beech trees. Described as being \"on an eminence in the north-western north-western part of the park\" is the hillfort of Croft Ambrey, \"said to have been the camp of the British king, Ambrosius\" (Ambrosius Aurelianus), elliptical in form with double ditch and ramparts. From the camp can be seen thirteen counties. Previously the Croft estate was the seat of the Croft family, of Saxon origin. At c.1000 during the reign of Edward the Confessor the manor was held by Sir Bernard \u00e1 Croft, who was succeeded by Sir Jasper \u00e1 Croft, who, as a supporter of King Harold, was deprived of the manor, which was given to William de Scochin (William d'Ecouis) by William the Conqueror. The manor was later recovered by the Croft descendants who remained until the end of the 18th century, when the property was sold by Sir Archer Croft, 3rd Baronet (1731\u20131792) to Thomas Johnes (1748\u20131816), the translator, MP, landscape architect and social benefactor, who then sold it to Somerset Davies, whose family still held the property in the 1870s. The Crofts had represented Herefordshire in fifteen Parliaments between 1307 and 1695, and at the time of the directory listing, were represented in parliament by Sir Herbert Croft, 9th Baronet, MP, who was living at Lugwardine Court near Hereford."]}]}}
