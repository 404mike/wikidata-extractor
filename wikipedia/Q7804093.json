He has spent most of his career working on the dynamics and predictability of weather and climate.  Among various research achievements, he pioneered the development of probabilistic ensemble forecasting techniques for weather and climate prediction (at the Met Office and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).  These techniques are now standard in operational weather and climate prediction around the world, and are central for reliable decision making for many commercial and humanitarian applications.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dirac Medal", "response": ["* 2014: Tim Palmer (University of Oxford)  For the development of probabilistic weather and climate prediction systems."]}, {"page": "Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal", "response": ["* 2010: Tim Palmer for fundamental contributions to understanding the role of nonlinear processes in the predictability of weather and climate, and for developing tools for estimating such predictability."]}, {"page": "Royal Meteorological Society", "response": ["* 2010\u20132012: Tim Palmer "]}, {"page": "Superdeterminism", "response": ["Physicists Sabine Hossenfelder and Tim Palmer have argued that superdeterminism \"is a promising approach not only to solve the measurement problem, but also to understand the apparent non-locality of quantum physics\"."]}, {"page": "Palmer (surname)", "response": ["*Tim Palmer, British music producer, audio engineer and musician", "*Tim Palmer (physicist) (born 1952)"]}, {"page": "Tim Palmer", "response": ["*Tim Palmer @ Discogs", "*Tim Palmer : Biography & History"]}, {"page": "List of climate scientists", "response": ["*Tim Palmer CBE FRS (1952-), British mathematical physicist, climate modeler at Oxford University"]}, {"page": "Invariant set postulate", "response": ["The proposer of the postulate is climate scientist and physicist Tim Palmer.
