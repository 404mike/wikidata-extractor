He and his siblings were h\u0101nai (informally adopted) to other family members in the Native Hawaiian tradition. Prior to birth, his parents had promised to give their child in h\u0101nai to Kuini Liliha, a high-ranking chiefess and the widow of High Chief Boki. However, after he was born, High Chiefess Ha\u02bbaheo Kaniu took the baby to Honuakaha, the residence of the king. Kuhina Nui (regent) Elizabeth K\u012bna\u02bbu, who disliked Liliha, deliberated and decreed his parents to give him to Ha\u02bbaheo and her husband Keaweamahi Kinimaka. When Ha\u02bbaheo died in 1843 she bequeathed all her properties to him. After Ha\u02bbaheo's death, his guardianship was entrusted to his h\u0101nai father, who was a chief of lesser rank; he took Kal\u0101kaua to live in L\u0101hain\u0101.

After leave, Tryon was posted to HMS Vengeance, captained by Lord Edward Russell. Vengeance sailed for the Mediterranean in August 1851.  The ship was second fastest of the battleships and frigates (after Phaeton), lending considerable prestige to her crew at a time when sailing ability and speed were still considered all important. Admiral William Robert Mends later said of Tryon, 'He served with me, when I was commander of the Vengeance, for two years as a midshipman, and a better young officer never existed; ever full of energy and zeal. As a boat midshipman and signal midshipman he was unrivalled.'Fitzgerald p.33 The ship stopped at Alexandria, and Tryon was given ten days leave to visit Cairo, where the party were received as guests of the Pasha. The party were obliged to stay on as guests, missing the sailing of their ship. The consul advised Captain Russell who then joined the party, which had now transformed into a diplomatic mission promoting British plans for a railway from Alexandria to Cairo. Tryon wrote home, explaining the British desire to create a land route to India, and the continuous vying for power in the region between Britain and France. On a trip to Gibraltar, Tryon and others from the ship joined the local foxhunt in a group of around forty (some in red), riding across the rugged and precipitous terrain on local ponies. Vengeance returned to England in 1852, reaching Spithead on Christmas Day.Fitzgerald pp. 30\u201338"]}, {"page": "Matureivavao", "response": ["The first recorded sighting of this atoll was made during the Spanish expedition of the Portuguese navigator Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Quir\u00f3s on 5 February 1606 under the name Las Cuatro Coronadas (the \"four crowned\" (by coconut palms)),Brand, Donald D.

His patrons included high ranking naval officers, powerful businessmen, and members of Parliament.  Several upper crust boxing students and alumni from Cambridge University were boxing students of Langham when he lived in Cambridge and may have remained supporters of his club.  Tom Sayers found a worthy adversary to box and spar with at the club when his career was flagging.  Morning boxing matches for purses were staged in the club and sometimes in remote spots closer to Epsom, and were often preceded by lengthy late night meals followed by the Club's prized plum pudding.  Bouts inside the club sometimes featured boxers fighting in the nude, for the unique tastes of some of the aristocratic patrons.  Meals were famously consumed inside a regulation 24 square foot boxing ring, despite the tight fit as Langham acted as Master of Ceremonies.  Aristocratic patrons included James Grimston, known as Lord Verulam, a former member of both the House of Lords and Commons, Lord Caledon, and Admiral Lord Edward Russell.  Other wealthy patrons included Lord Robert Grimston, brother of James, Sir Robert Peel, amateur boxer and son of the Prime Minister, and Robert's brother Royal Navy Captain William Peel, also an accomplished amateur boxer.  Other distinguished patrons included Royal Navy Commander William Hope-Johnstone and Brown and Harris of the London Stock Exchange.  Jem Mace claimed to have once boxed Archibald William Douglas (1818-1856), the 8th Marquess of Queensbury, known as (Viscount Drumlanrig) at the Club.  Douglas had served as a former member of the House of Commons and was the father of John Douglas, credited with helping to establish boxing's modern Marquess of Queensberry Rules.List of patrons, location and details of the club in Thormanby, (1900) Boxers and their Battles; Antecdotal Sketches and Personal Recollections, London, R. A. Everett and Co., pg. 267-8.  The top rated boxers, Cambridge students, and aristocracy who frequented the Club cemented Langham's legacy, and place in society.    When Langham died, the fights and sparring matches staged there moved to retired boxer, club patron, and good friend Alex Keene's \"Two Tuns\" Tavern.Rum-Pum-Pas Club described in Staples, Arthur, \"The Ring\", Times Union, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 15, 1 May 1924"]}, {"page": "Edward Russell", "response": ["* Lord Edward Russell (1805\u20131887), British Member of Parliament", "* Lord Edward Russell (1642\u20131714), English politician"]}, {"page": "Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Lord Edward Russell", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Lord Edward Russell"]}, {"page": "HMS Vengeance (1824)", "response": ["Having returned to Britain, in August 1851 Vengeance, commanded by Captain Lord Edward Russell, left Portsmouth for the Mediterranean.
