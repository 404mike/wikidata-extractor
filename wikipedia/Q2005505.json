With talks progressing well McAvennie decided not to sign for Luton due to the attitude of their chairman, David Evans. With St Mirren then agreeing a fee with West Ham United, McAvennie met with their manager John Lyall and his staff and he signed for them in June 1985 for \u00a3340,000. He made his West Ham debut on 17 August 1985, the opening game of the season, in a 1\u20130 away defeat to Birmingham City with his first two goals coming in his second game, a 3\u20131 home defeat of Queens Park Rangers.

His biggest contribution was probably his decision to make Paul Gascoigne an integral part of the first team despite his being only 18 at the time. McFaul has since managed teams in Northern Ireland and worked as the coach of the national team of Guam. In Northern Ireland he managed his hometown club Coleraine who are very close to his heart. Things didn't go to plan and his spell as manager coincided with a lowly period in Coleraine history. He did, however, discover Paul Gaston, who went on to captain Coleraine and play over 600 games for the club.", "Little transfer activity over the summer of 1986 meant that Newcastle had a bad start to the 1986\u201387 season and found them bottom of the table in November.

Goddard's arrival inspired the team to wins over Chelsea, West Ham United and Nottingham Forest. Newcastle were still bottom in March 1987 and they found help from Gascoigne and Goddard, with Goddard equalling a club record of scoring in seven straight games, to finish the season in mid-table.", "Peter Beardsley was sold to Liverpool on the eve of the 1987\u201388 season for a British record \u00a31.9m, to the anger of Newcastle's fans. McFaul signed Brazil's flamboyant striker Mirandinha to replace Beardsley, and with Wimbledon winger Glyn Hodges coming in as well as Irish teenager Michael O'Neill, Newcastle had their best season under McFaul finishing eighth, with Gascoigne taking all the plaudits winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award. The summer of 1988 brought McFaul's biggest challenge as manager of Newcastle United, as key players Paul Gascoigne, Neil McDonald and Paul Goddard were sold for a combined fee of \u00a33.7M, to the dismay of the Toon Army. With huge gaps in the team McFaul went on a shopping spree buying goalkeeper Dave Beasant for \u00a3700,000, defender Andy Thorn for \u00a3800,000, winger John Hendrie for \u00a3500,000, and Hearts striker John Robertson for \u00a3800,000.
