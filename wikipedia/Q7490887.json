In the draw for the 3rd qualification round of the Champions League Motherwell were drawn against Greek heavyweights Panathanaikos.  This ended in disappointment as Motherwell were knocked out after losing 2\u20130 at home and then 3\u20130 away.  The 2012\u201313 season brought even greater success in the SPL as the club finished 2nd in the table and once again qualified for the Europa League.

A few days later, the Scottish Football Association charged Randolph with \"violent conduct by kicking an opposing player\" and offered a two-match ban; Motherwell appealed, but the ban was upheld.

Despite the loss, Law spoke of his debut, saying: \"It was classic European football, particularly Champions League\". In the summer transfer window, Law was the subject of a bid from a League One club, which was rejected.

After a run of good performances, Law was awarded March's Scottish Premier League player of the month. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Law, alongside teammates Shaun Hutchinson, Darren Randolph and Michael Higdon, was named in the PFA Scotland Team of the Year 2012\u201313.
