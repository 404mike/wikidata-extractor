David Nathan wrote that \u201c[Barker] never bothers to substantiate central theme that women are less cruel than men and indeed sabotages it\u201d, with Benedict Nightingale writing that in the play \u201cradical feminism is accused of being obverse Thatcherism\u201d and that \u201c[Barker\u2019s] treatment of gender, sexuality, has never been comforting.\u201d The Listener's Jim Hiley had a more mixed opinion. He felt that Barker had created \u201ca morality play, audacious yet subtle and generous\u201d that \u201cpits women [\u2026] as saviours [\u2026] on the side of life and nature, against men as demonic artificers [and] destroyers\u201d and praised Barker for going \u201cfurther than most\u201d other male playwrights in writing \u201cmore complex female roles\u201d and \u201cconscientious[ly] squaring up to the challenge of feminism\u201d. However, Hiley felt that \u201cElsewhere, Barker seems caught in the very responses he seeks to dismantle\u201d with elements of the play that \u201cjoltingly reminds us we're watching a play by a man\u201d and where \u201cBarker's analysis seems painfully stretched\u201d. Barney Bardsley for City Limits wrote that in the play \u201cBarker denies the strength of women, but despises the tyranny of men in what turns out to be a moving and eloquent admission of defeat.\u201d Michael Billington was more supportive writing that \u201cthe play is far more than a simplistic championing of matriarchal values\u201d and presented \u201ca fascinating spiritual tussle in which competitive masculine destructiveness does battle with compassionate female creativity\u201d in which Barker \u201cis raising a vital moral question: how far could, and should, women go in order to change the values of society?\u201d Giles Gordon declared The Castle to be \u201cimmeasurably the most sophisticated if difficult feminist play I've seen.\u201d"]}]}}
