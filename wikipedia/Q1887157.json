They consolidated their success a few months later with \"The Dean and I\", which peaked at No.10 in September. They released two singles, \"Headline Hustler\" (in the US) and the self-mocking \"The Worst Band in the World\" (in the UK) and launched a UK tour on 26 August 1973, joined by second drummer Paul Burgess, before returning to Strawberry Studios in November to record the remainder of their second LP, Sheet Music (1974), which included \"The Worst Band in the World\" along with other hits \"The Wall Street Shuffle\" (No.10, 1974) and \"Silly Love\" (No.24, 1974).

Their first album as a three piece band was Deceptive Bends (1977), named after a sign on the Mickleham bends on the A24 between Leatherhead and Dorking in Surrey. The album, recorded at the newly completed Strawberry South Studio in Dorking, Surrey, reached No.\u00a03 in Britain and No.\u00a031 in the US and also yielded three hit singles, \"The Things We Do for Love\" (UK No.\u00a06, US No.\u00a05), \"Good Morning Judge\" (UK No.\u00a05, US No.\u00a069) and \"People in Love\" (US No.\u00a040).

It reached No.70 on the UK charts. The band toured the UK in October, with drummer Jamie Lane in place of Paul Burgess (who was working with Jethro Tull). This turned out to be their last tour until they reformed eight years later.", "In 1999 Gouldman convened a 10cc line-up comprising himself, Fenn, Paul Burgess, and new recruits Mick Wilson (vocals, guitar) and Mike Stevens (vocals, keyboards, sax, guitar). This version of the band played their first gig at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Birmingham and then began touring regularly in 2002. The same five members have been associated with the group ever since. A new member, Keith Hayman (keyboards), switched with Mike Stevens in 2006 and continued to do so until 2011. This iteration of the group also featured occasional guest appearances by Kevin Godley, and toured both the UK and overseas, playing 10cc hits plus a section of Gouldman's hits written for others.
