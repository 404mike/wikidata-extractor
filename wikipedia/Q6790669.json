In 2001 after failing to establish himself a first-team player he left to join Swindon Town where his career took off, becoming an established centre half for four years before moving on to Bristol City in 2005. A year later he joined Brentford and in 2008 following his final season at the club he was awarded the supporters player of the season award for the 2007\u201308 season. He then joined Grimsby Town who were the last professional club he was to play for inside the Football League before he was released in 2010 and briefly joined Barrow on a short-term deal. He finished his career in non-League football with a 6-month stay at Buxton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barry Conlon", "response": ["Following the conclusion of the 2008\u201309 campaign, he was released by Bradford, and shortly afterwards he signed for Grimsby permanently on a two-year contract. Conlon's season began on a plus point, scoring on the opening day game with Cheltenham Town, but he soon lost his place in the first team due to two red cards in three games which left him suspended for seven matches, in which his team seemingly struggled too find an adequate replacement who could find the back of the net. Following the dismissal of manager Mike Newell, Conlon found himself out of favour with new manager Neil Woods often using him as a substitute. He was also relegated to the reserves, and spent one night in a police station cell because of driving offences only hours before a reserve fixture with Scunthorpe United. On 13 January 2010, Woods told Conlon, along with Danny Boshell, Matthew Heywood and Jamie Clarke, that they were free to leave the club in the January transfer window. On 1 March 2010, over a month since Conlon's Grimsby departure, the club held a fans forum giving a chance for the supporters to voice recent club concerns with chairman John Fenty and manager Neil Woods. Conlon's release to Chesterfield had been slightly criticised by some supporters because of the fact he was the Grimsby's current seasonal top goalscorer, and was seemingly the only proven goal scorer in the ranks at Blundell Park. Fenty was asked by a supporter during the forum why Conlon was allowed to leave. Fenty answered that Conlon had become a disruptive influence, having failed to turn up for training and not answered phone calls from the club. Conlon later admitted that after an enjoyable loan spell with Grimsby his \"heart wasn't in it\" when he signed permanently for the club and that his commuting from his Leeds home had left him exhausted. He also claimed that new manager Neil Woods was \"clueless\"."]}, {"page": "Jamie Clarke (footballer, born 1982)", "response": ["Only a few weeks after the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Clarke was the first new face in at Grimsby Town for the 2007\u201308 campaign. Manager Alan Buckley brought him in as the club's new right back, to cater for the vacant spot left by retiring and long serving legend John McDermott. Despite this, Clarke was also deployed in midfield during his first season. He managed to make an appearance at Wembley Stadium for the club, as they lost 2\u20130 to Milton Keynes Dons in the Final of the Football League Trophy. In the 2008\u201309 season, Buckley signed Robbie Stockdale as the club's first choice right back, giving Clarke an uphill struggle to claim a place in the team. His adopted midfield role was his main role throughout the season. However, when Buckley was sacked, his replacement Mike Newell opted to bring in fresh faces in both defence and midfield, making several players come ahead of Clarke in the pecking order. Clarke eventually would only be called upon in the event of illness or injury. At the end of the season, Newell commented on BBC Radio Humberside that Clarke as well as fellow utility player Danny Boshell may still be offered a fresh deal, and Clarke put pen to paper to sign a fresh one-year deal a week later. On 13 January 2010, new manager Neil Woods told Clarke, along with Danny Boshell, Matthew Heywood and Barry Conlon that they were free to leave the club in the January transfer window. Clarke was released by the club on 2 February 2010, along with Boshell and Heywood."]}, {"page": "Rob Atkinson", "response": ["Rob Atkinson was initially signed for Grimsby Town on loan in November 2007 by Alan Buckley. He was drafted in as a covering defender, and was slotted in at centre back next to Nick Fenton. He scored his first goal for the club against Chester City on 1 January 2008. Atkinson went on to play he full 90 minutes at Wembley Stadium, in the Football League Trophy final defeat against MK Dons. Atkinson was singled out by Grimsby fans, as one of their more stronger players in the 2007\u201308 season, and in May 2008, Buckley revealed his desire to bring Atkinson back to the club on loan or possibly on a permanent deal. However at the time, nothing came of the transfer, and after Buckley signed centre backs Richard Hope and Matthew Heywood in pre-season, the Atkinson deal became dead in the water. On 31 October 2008 he re-signed for Grimsby on another loan deal, initially until January 2009. Town who were now managed by Mike Newell had signed Atkinson along with Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala, who was another former Grimsby player. Both transfers were made in the space of two days. Atkinson made his second debut for the club in a 2\u20131 defeat to Darlington when he came on as a substitute for skipper Matthew Heywood in the 30th minute of play. In January 2009 Rob's loan contract with Grimsby expired and he returned to Barnsley. However a day later he joined the club for a third spell, signing on an emergency loan deal to play the league fixture with Morecambe on 10 January. A deal was struck between Barnsley and Grimsby for a permanent switch that was completed two days later. Rob went on to cement a first team place at centre back alongside youngster Ryan Bennett, who had become the club's new captain, replacing Matt Heywood, who had been dropped due to poor performances. Atkinson and Bennett both were integral parts of the Grimsby squad that helped stave off relegation out of the Football League. During the 2009\u201310 season The Mariners suffered an eventual relegation, bowing out on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "Matt Heywood", "response": ["#REDIRECTMatthew Heywood"]}]}}
