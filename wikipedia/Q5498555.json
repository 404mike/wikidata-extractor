Piper studied drama under Elsie Fogerty at the Central School of Speech and Drama, then based at the Royal Albert Hall, London.Never a leading player, Piper was usually cast in minor, sometimes uncredited, parts although he also appeared in some more substantial supporting roles. Piper never aspired to star-status, but became a recognisable face on the British screen through the sheer volume of films in which he appeared. His credits include a number of films which are considered classics of British cinema, among them five 1930s Alfred Hitchcock films; he also appeared in many Ealing Studios productions, including some of the celebrated Ealing comedies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Prisoner", "response": ["* Frederick Piper"]}, {"page": "1979 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 22 || Frederick Piper || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 76 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Passport to Pimlico", "response": ["* Frederick Piper as Jim Garland"]}, {"page": "The Blue Lamp", "response": ["* Frederick Piper as Alf Lewis"]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|David Buck,Caroline Mortimer,Toke Townley,Joan Hickson,Arthur Pentelow,Thomas Baptiste,Sheila Grant,Frederick Piper,Winifred Dennis,John Herrington,Reg Lever"]}, {"page": "49th Parallel (film)", "response": ["* Frederick Piper as David"]}, {"page": "Champagne Charlie (1944 film)", "response": ["* Frederick Piper as Learoyd"]}, {"page": "Oh, Mr Porter!", "response": ["*Frederick Piper as Ledbetter"]}, {"page": "Arrival (The Prisoner)", "response": ["* Frederick Piper . . .
