He is best known as a member of Katrina and the Waves from 1981 to 1999 and of Robyn Hitchcock's Soft Boys from 1978 to 1981. Two of his better-known compositions, both written for Katrina and the Waves, are \"Walking on Sunshine\" and \"Love Shine a Light\", performed by Katrina and the Waves as the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, taking the country to its first victory in the contest since 1981.\nHis family is from Bristol and moved house several times during his boyhood before he arrived at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1971, and settled in that city. After a brief excursion into archaeology at West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village and gaining a degree in archaeology from Cambridge, Rew formed the Waves with Alex Cooper in 1975, before joining the Soft Boys in 1978, recording the A Can of Bees and Underwater Moonlight albums.\nIn 1981, Robyn Hitchcock began his solo career; Rew and Cooper joined with Katrina Leskanich and Vince de la Cruz to form Katrina and the Waves. The group survived a slow career climb by tours of RAF bases and Canadian club gigs, then teamed up with the producers Pat Collier and Scott Litt to record Rew's compositions \"Going Down to Liverpool\", covered by The Bangles, and, in 1985, \"Walking on Sunshine\", which became the group's first and biggest hit.\nIn 1997, Katrina and the Waves won the Eurovision Song Contest for the United Kingdom with the Rew composition \"Love Shine a Light\".\nIn 1999, Katrina began her solo career. Rew continued to write, record and release solo albums.\nFrom 1988 through to 2004, Rew was a guest member with the Cambridge band The Lonely. He played on four albums, Underground (1989), Rarer Gifts (1998) and Live (2000).\nIn 2001 Rew reunited and toured with Robyn Hitchcock, bassist Matthew Seligman, and Morris Windsor for the Soft Boys' re-release of their best-known album, 1980's Underwater Moonlight. The following year they recorded and released a new album, Nextdoorland, which was accompanied by a short album of outtakes, Side Three. The reunion was short-lived.\nCeline Dion recorded the Rew composition \"That's Just the Woman in Me\" in 2007.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Rew completed a project to walk or cycle the coast of England and Wales and another to walk or cycle all of their navigable waterways.\nRew joined the Cambridge band Jack in 2004 (his wife Lee Cave-Berry had previously joined in 2000) and they are both still playing with the band (as of 2020).  Rew and his wife also perform as a duo called Kim and Lee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bangles", "response": ["The Bangles' full-length debut album on Columbia Records, All Over the Place (1984), captured their power pop roots, featuring the singles \"Hero Takes a Fall\" and the Kimberley Rew-penned Beatlesque \"Going Down to Liverpool\" (originally recorded by Rew's band Katrina and the Waves). The record received good reviews and the video for \"Liverpool\" featured Leonard Nimoy, which helped to generate further publicity.
